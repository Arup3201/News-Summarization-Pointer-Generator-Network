Dogs are famously known as man's best friend - but they can be pretty loyal to their fellow canines too.

Take labrador Dakota for example, who is being credited with rescuing a diminutive Yorkshire terrier from the clutches of a hawk.

The dogs' owner Steve Groves is convinced his yellow lab saved 7lb Yorkie Cory's life after the smaller dog was targeted by a bird of prey in northern Idaho, U.S.

Daring dog: Steve Groves says his yellow lab Dakota saved his Yorkshire terrier from the clutches of a hawk

It was then he realised that terrier Cory was nowhere to be seen on his 10-acre property on Blossom Mountain. A few moments later he spotted a hawk flying off, and a short time afterwards Dakota and Cory trotted home, he told the Coeur d'Alene Press.

Mr Groves said Cory had cuts to his back, and that he and the dog's vet agreed they were left by a bird's talons.

Close call: Cory the Yorkshire terrier was wounded when he was attacked by a hawk, his owner says

Mr Groves, who also owns a Portuguese water dog named Bentley, said the dogs were very 'protective' of one another.

'If it wasn't for Dakota, we wouldn't have Cory,' he said.

Even 
if the hawk could not fly away with Cory, the bird would likely have 
eaten him on the ground, the dogs' relieved owner said.

Cory prefers to stay inside the house and closer to home following the ordeal, said Mr Groves.
