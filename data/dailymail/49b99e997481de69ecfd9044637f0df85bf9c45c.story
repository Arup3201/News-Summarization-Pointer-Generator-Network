An Irish backpacker could face up to two years in jail after she was charged with concealing the birth of a newborn in the Australian outback.

The 25-year-old was travelling with friends in the Kimberley region of Western Australia in May but had not realised that she had fallen pregnant, police said.

She was alone at a home in the remote town of Halls Creek, more than 2,800km northeast of Perth, when she gave birth to the child, the ABC reported.

An Irish backbacker was travelling with friends in the Kimberley region of Western Australia in May but had not realised that she had fallen pregnant, police said

The woman faced court in Kununurra, in the eastern Kimberley area, on May 23.

Police alleged that she hid the newborn but only notified her friends several days later.

The Irishwoman was then taken to hospital where staff alerted police.

They investigated the child's death and charged the backpacker with concealing the birth.

It is mandatory that all births are reported, as part of the law, even if an infant has died of natural causes.

The case was referred to Perth and she will reappear in court on October 2.

The woman could face a maximum penalty of two years in jail.

It has been reported that she remains in Perth while the court case continues.
