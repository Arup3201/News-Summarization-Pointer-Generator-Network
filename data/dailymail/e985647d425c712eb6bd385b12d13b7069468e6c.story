Deployed to the harsh war-torn outer reaches of Afghanistan, Sgt Daniel Rasik could hardly have been further away from his heavily pregnant wife.

And when Genevieve went into labor, the couple were confronted with the prospect of being apart for the birth of their third child.

But thanks to the internet, the serving U.S. Army soldier was able to watch his son being born and comfort his wife from thousands of miles away.

Sgt Rasik was beamed halfway across the globe via Skype from the front line into the hospital room at Martin Memorial in Stuart.

Genevieve, who gave birth by Caesarian section, told WPTV.com: 'It was the happiest moment of my life followed by the saddest moment of my life when I found out he couldn't be there.'

Recounting how the events unfolded last month, Mrs Rasik said she did not think the video call would work.

But the couple decided to give it a go anyway and were overcome with how the technology managed to make the miles of separation disappear.

Mrs Rasik added: 'I looked to my left and saw my husband. Even though he was so far away, he was there.

'Words can't describe how much it means 
to us that he was there.

'He didn't have to miss the 
birth of his child and I could have the support that I needed at that 
time.'

The 'cyber-birth' was the idea of Dr Pete Papapanos, who told WPTV.com: 'I thanked him for all the good things are troops are doing overseas for us and how they are keeping us safe,' adding: 'I told him I was going to do everything I could to keep his family safe.'

The Rasiks have two other children - twins, who are 13 months old. Benjamin and his father are expected to meet in person in the spring after Mr. Rasik's deployment.
