Buyers: Sol Campbell, 40, and his wife Fiona, 34 snapped up the six-storey townhouse in Chelsea

Having threatened to leave the country over Labour’s proposed mansion tax, it was perhaps of little surprise when Sol Campbell put his Chelsea townhouse up for sale.

Far more surprising was the identity of the purchaser of the former football star’s £20million property – himself.

The six-storey home on the banks of the Thames was bought by company H Wall Ltd, which the former England international, 40, jointly owns with his wife, interior designer Fiona Barratt-Campbell, 34.

It was first listed for sale in October last year for £25million. The sale included a mews property, where the couple’s housekeeper lives, which is joined to the main home by a tunnel.

Campbell, who has a number of other properties, including a Northumberland mansion, put the Chelsea house on the market just weeks after he blasted the Labour Party’s mansion tax policy, which he described as a ‘cheap and easy way to extract money from individuals who have done well.’

Land Registry documents suggest the sale was registered on December 5 last year, a day after higher stamp duty levies came into effect. It is possible the sale took place shortly before it was registered, in which case it may have avoided the greatly increased charges.

Companies House documents reveal that the Chelsea house was registered to company NE Properties Ltd. However, Campbell had a mortgage on the house and he has widely referred to it as his own. He does not appear to have any other connection to NE Properties. He has also submitted several planning applications for the house, stretching back over a decade.

He let it during the 2012 Olympics for £75,000 per week and, speaking at the time, Mrs Barratt-Campbell told The Telegraph: ‘It has an amazing entertaining space on the first floor, with views of the river and Albert Bridge, which is beautiful when it is lit up at night. We have a garden, a mews house – where our housekeeper and family live and which is connected to the main house by a tunnel under the garden, so it is completely secure.’

The property also boasts its own lift and gym. It has six bedrooms, five bathrooms, a drawing room, library and a 45ft garden. It was renovated in 2008, with Mrs Barratt-Campbell designing the interior. She is the granddaughter of Sir Lawrie Barratt, who founded Barratt Homes. Criticising the mansion tax last year, Campbell told the BBC: ‘Over the years I have spent millions in income tax and stamp duty but I am being punished for investing in a property portfolio. I see this as a tax on aspiration.’

Ed Miliband claims his flagship policy will raise £1.2billion a year. Those in homes worth between £2million and £3million will pay an extra £3,000 a year in tax. Labour has said those in even more expensive homes will pay still more.

Former Arsenal and Tottenham defender Campbell told The Times last month: ‘With a mansion tax, you’re taxing me for being prudent.

‘You’ve got death taxes already. If Labour gets in, I’d leave. I’d have to say, “Sorry, I want to ship out”.’

He reiterated the opinion in a series of angry tweets in September last year.

He wrote to his 33,000 followers: ‘MansionTax? Why should we except this? @uklabour are the grim reaper of business entrepreneurs or anyone that has done well!’

Last night tax experts said the complex ownership arrangements made it difficult to work out what the financial benefit for Campbell of selling the Chelsea property to his own company would be.

Because Labour has not yet detailed its mansion tax plans it was also unclear how the sale might affect Campbell’s possible bill under the proposed levy.
