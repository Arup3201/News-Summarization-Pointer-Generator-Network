Fears that the morning after pill may be less effective in overweight women are unfounded, experts say.

Last November the maker of Norlevo - a morning after pill available in France - changed its packaging to state the pill did not work among women over a certain weight.

At least 200,000 prescriptions a year are written out for Levonelle, 
Britain’s most popular emergency contraceptive, which contains the same key ingredient as Norlevo - as does Plan B One-Step available in the U.S.

Morning after pills such as Levonelle - contain the ingredient levonorgestrel  - are effective in heavier women, experts say

The French manufacturer referenced studies which showed the pill is less effective among women who weigh more than 11st 11lb and 
does not work at all in women over 12st 8lb. The average British 
woman weighs around 11 stone.

But after a review, the European Medicines Agency has said Norlevo is suitable for heavier women.

In a statement, the EMA said it had assessed all the available evidence and announced the data 'are too limited and not robust enough to conclude with certainty' that the pill's efficacy is reduced in heavier women.

While results of these studies should be included in the product information, current warnings on Norlevo's packaging should be deleted, it added.

The morning after pill contains a higher dose of the hormone in regular birth control pills. 

The drug is thought to prevent 
pregnancy by interfering with the release of eggs and disrupting 
fertilisation. It may also stop any fertilised egg from implanting in 
the womb.

Taking it within 72 hours of intercourse can cut the chances of pregnancy by up to 89 per cent, but it works best within the first 24 hours.

Fears had been raised after a French morning after pill manufacturer said its product was less effective among women who weigh more than 11st 11lb and did not work at all in women over 12 stone 8lb

The issue about weight and efficacy came to light two years 
ago, when an Edinburgh University study found that obese women were more
 than three times as likely as those of normal weight to become pregnant
 after taking the morningafter pill.

The link was particularly strong 
for levonorgestrel-based pills.

It is thought that the drug may 
be diluted in bigger women or broken down more quickly by their bodies. 
It is also possible that the drug is soaked up by their fat cells, 
stopping it from working properly.

Professor Anna Glasier, the 
study’s lead researcher, advised bigger women to have a copper coil, or 
IUD, fitted or take EllaOne, another morning after pill containing a 
different chemical.

It works for longer than Levonelle and is more 
effective and can be taken up to five days after unprotected sex.
