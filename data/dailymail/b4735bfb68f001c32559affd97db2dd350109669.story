Dennis Plater, 82, who was found stabbed to death outside his home in Gloucestershire last Friday 

Tributes have been paid to a model-railway loving pensioner who was found stabbed to death on the driveway of his bungalow in the Cotswolds.

Dennis Plater, 82, was discovered last Friday at his home in Walkley Hill, in Stroud, Gloucestershire following reports that he had died.

On Sunday police arrested a 47-year-old man more than 100 miles away in Southsea, Hampshire and he remains in custody while being questioned by detectives.

In a statement released by his family, Mr Plater was described as a beloved husband, father, brother and grandfather.

It said: 'Dennis and his wife Mary moved to Stroud in 2004 to be closer to their daughter and her family; they had come to call it home.

'Dennis enjoyed crafts, tapestry and was most happy tinkering with his model railway.

'It is incomprehensible that we have lost Dennis in this way, and the family would like to ask that you respect our privacy at this difficult time.

'We thank all the Gloucestershire Police force for their hard work, help and support.'

After his body was discovered, a white forensic tent was erected on the driveway of Mr Plater's home and police covered the windows of the house with black sheets.

Neighbours said Mr Plater had lived alone since the death of his wife a few years ago.

One, who wished to remain anonymous, said: 'He was a nice guy. When we saw each other we always said a few words.

'He was quite frail and he lived there with his wife.

'She died three or four years ago and since then I haven't seen much of him. I think they had been together their whole lives.'

Another neighbour added: 'It's really sad. Apparently a neighbour found him on the drive.'

Gloucestershire Police added that Mr Plater's family is being supported by police family liaison officers 

'It's tragic. This is a peaceful road. There have been a few burglaries but nothing like this.

Gloucestershire Police added: 'The dead man's family has been notified and is being supported by family liaison officers as well as being kept informed of the ongoing investigation.'

The coroner has been informed of the death and a post-mortem examination has been completed, a force spokesman added.
