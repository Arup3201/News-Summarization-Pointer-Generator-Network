'Obviously this is a very tragic, unfortunate accident,' Wardlow told NewsOk.com.

The Christ the King Catholic School and the local church community were shocked by the tragedy.

'It is with a heavy heart that I acknowledge the painful tragedy that occurred at Christ the King this morning,' the Most Rev. Paul S. Coakley, Archbishop of Oklahoma City, said in a statement.

'As an archdiocese, we grieve the loss of Quaid Thomas 'QT' Dolan and pray for the peace and comfort of all those who are affected by this sad and unexpected occurrence. My sympathy and concern go out especially to the Dolan family and to the entire Christ the King community in this time of suffering.'

The Dolans have six other children and it is believed the father was dropping a number of them off at the school when Quaid was struck.
