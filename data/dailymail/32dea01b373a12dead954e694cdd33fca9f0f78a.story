She was given a telling off by television bosses when it emerged she had boasted online about smoking marijuana.

And it would appear Louis Walsh had an inkling of X Factor hopeful Tamera Foster's somewhat wild ways as he warned her not to 'mess up' what could be an 'amazing career' in the music industry on Sunday night's episode.

Although Louis' words of warning came well before the talented teenager was caught posting incriminating pictures on her Twitter page, he told her she had the most potential out of anyone he'd seen on the show, including the likes of former winners Alexandra Burke and Leona Lewis.

Wise owl: It would appear Louis Walsh had an inkling of X Factor hopeful Tamera Foster's somewhat wild ways as he warned her not to 'mess up' what could be an 'amazing career' on Sunday night's episode

The 16-year-old hopeful's second round audition at London's Wembley Arena initially got off to a jittery start, when she told host Dermot O'Leary just how nervous she was about performing in front of 4,000 people.

Before taking to the stage, she said: 'The only performances I've ever done are in school assemblies, I'm so nervous. I'm feeling really scared about being judged on my own.

'This is so surreal. It's been non-stop rehearsals and it's just so much to take in. I'm so so so so nervous.'

Nervous: The teenager battled some serious stage fright as she performed in the arena on Sunday night's show

Moral support: Tamera's family and friends looked on in horror as she totally froze on stage

And things went from bad to worse when Tamera got up on the stage, totally freezing with stage fright as she prepared to sing Whitney Houston Classic I Have Nothing.

After asking judges Louis, Gary Barlow, Nicole Scherzinger and Sharon Osbourne for two seconds to compose herself, the teen singer ran off stage, where she was reminded of the lyrics to the track by numerous members of her family and host Dermot.

Although she fluffed a couple of the lines, the aspiring starlet soon impressed the crowd and judging panel alike with a virtually flawless vocal. 

Worried: The judging panel were all concerned about Tamera's nerves, but told her they were impressed with her unique talent

Delighted: Louis told Tamera she had even more natural talent than former X Factor winners Leona Lewis and Alexandra Burke

Getting the entire arena up on their feet, the teenager looked astounded at the reception she received.

Gary said: 'It was by no means perfect, but what we see right now is potential beyond belief. That was captivating and mesmerising.'

Sharon added: 'You take my breath away. So many people want to be Whitney, but her songs are so huge. I thought you were going to destroy it, but you were amazing. If you forget your lyrics in Boot Camp, I will smack you with a big stick.'

Nicole said: 'You're still young and have a lot to work on. But You have a gift and a talent, you're a star.'

All smiles: The aspiring star couldn't conceal her delight as she rushed off the stage to greet her proud family

First-night jitters: Both Sharon and Nicole told Tamera she would need to concentrate in Boot Camp to conquer her nerves

Impressive: Nicole told Tamera she had made her want to mentor the girls' category in this year's competition

Louis explained: 'I don't think I've seen anybody with the potential you have in 10 years of doing this, not Leona Lewis, not Alexandra Burke. You're better. This could be the first day of an amazing career for you, don't mess it up.'

Tamera said: 'I just had to get myself in the right mindset

Sharon later reflected: 'I'll never forget that.'

Nicole added: 'I want the girls' category now.'

But Tamera's former Silver Roc bandmember Jerrie Dila, 22, who she was split up from at the first round of auditions didn't fare as well, and was sent home by the panel after failing to impress with her rendition of Rihanna's We Found Love.

Tamera's drugs scandal is the first major controversy to hit this year's X Factor when it emerged on Sunday that she had boasted online about smoking marijuana.

Controversy: Tamera Foster tweeted about smoking marijuana and has now been spoken to by X Factor bosses

The 16-year-old posted pictures of what appeared to be an unlit cannabis joint and tweeted about the effect of smoking 'Zoom' - marijuana coated in the class-A drug PCP.

In one tweet she wrote: 'Woiiii I just woke up :O that zoom last night put me to sleeeeeep garddd.'

In another she wrote: 'Time to fly high with my sis @LivvsParkerx'. Under the picture on her Twitter account she made several references to 'Mary Jane' - slang for cannabis.

X Factor chiefs have spoken to her and she is understood to be 'mortified'. Her account has now been suspended.

Tamera, from Gravesend, Kent, has been tipped to be a major star with judge Gary Barlow telling her on Saturday's show: 'You have potential beyond belief'.

A programme spokesman told the Sunday Mirror: 'The X Factor does not condone the use of drugs in any way and appropriate action will be taken against anyone found to be taking drugs while under our care.'

On January 13, Tamera reposted the picture of the 'joint' on her Twitter account - @DiorTee - with the words: 'This would please me right now.'

The newspaper reported she posted another picture of herself with a friend pointing out the effects marijuana can have, writing: 'Flying high with my homie Presh. Just look at my eyes mate.'

In another tweet, she wrote: 'Riding that morning wave with @LivvsParker x & The Sweet Mary Jane. Previously she had written: 'Inhale that good s*** exhale the bulls***.'

An X Factor source told the Sunday Mirror that Tamera had been 'spoken to' but because she was young that did not want to be too hard on her and 'ruin' her chances.

A show insider told MailOnline: 'She was 15 when she posted those comments. She was very young and naive. She just mad a big mistake and now wants to move on.'

Twitter followers have claimed the account isn't Tamera's but although she stopped using it months ago, it was still 'live'.

She had originally auditioned in Cardiff with 22-year-old Jerrie Diller as part of a duo Silver Rock. But the judges though they lacked chemistry and asked them to sing separately.

Drug scandals have twice rocked X Factor in the past with Frankie Cocozza being kicked off the show in 2011 for using cocaine, while Wagner faced the axe in 2010 for buying cannabis inside the TV studios.
