Today, 20,000 rugby fans from 127 countries will cheer them on to victory at the Stade Jean-Bouin stadium in Paris.

No, we're not talking about Owen Farrell, Chris Robshaw and Dylan Hartly, but a plumber, special needs teacher and youth manager who spend their free time playing for the England women's rugby team.

While little is known about these incredibly committed women, they, unlike the aforementioned men's team, juggle day jobs with their sporting commitments.

Today, their profile is set to sky-rocket as they take on Canada in their fourth successive World Cup final - and they're feeling confident.

With a half-century of Test appearances already, the next grand ambition is a collective one. England suffered an agonisingly narrow defeat in the home World Cup Final four years ago to finish as runners-up to New Zealand for the third consecutive tournament but Gary Street’s squad are hell-bent on making it fourth time lucky.

'I remember the 2002 World Cup when there was barely any recognition. You wouldn't have known a World Cup was going on. But this year the support we're getting and the recognition the sport is getting is amazing, the viewing figures just keep going up and it's just looking really good for the sport and for women in the sport,' Marlie Packer, 24, from Yeovil told The Observer.

Packer, a flanker, works full-time as a plumber and while she admits juggling the two commitments is 'a bit tricky', she's lucky because her employer is very good to her.

Joining her on the pitch is Margaret Alphonsi MBE. The 30-year-old flanker, along with Lawrence Dallaglio, Will Greenwood and Jonny Wilkinson, is an ambassador for the men's Rugby World Cup 2015 and works as a manager at Youth Sports Trust in the week.

Alphonsi has received numerous personal awards in her distinguished career, which has seen her claim seven successive Six Nations titles, six in Grand Slams, but a World Cup honour has proved elusive.

Accolades: Margaret Alphonsi MBE, is a 30-year-old flanker who, along with Lawrence Dallaglio, Will Greenwood and Jonny Wilkinson, is an ambassador for the men's Rugby World Cup 2015 and works as a manager at Youth Sports Trust in the week

Alphonsi, who is playing in her third World Cup, said: 'I've been very fortunate to have got the accolades that I have and all the recognition, which is brilliant.

'But the real reason why I wanted to get into the sport and play for England was to be world champion. It would mean the world.

'That's one accolade I haven't got. That's what I want for the team, as well as an individual thing."I want people to recognise us as the best team in the world.

'It's great to see recognition for what are some fantastic athletes,' she said. 'The standard of women's rugby across the world is just getting better and better.'

Success story: Prop Rochelle 'Rocky' Clark is the most-capped player in the squad with 91 appearances

Becky Essex, a 31-year-old lock/back row, said she'd love the opportunity to play rugby full-time. The special needs teacher says she hopes the sport is going in that direction and hopes that girls aren't put off by the seemingly risky nature of the game.

'This is a fantastic sport and we're just grateful to be able to play for our country, it's a tremendous honour,' she said. 

Prop Rochelle 'Rocky' Clark is the most-capped player in the squad with 91 appearances - she is also Head Coach of the Chesham Stags and Bucks New University and, in what time she has left, is also a personal trainer.

'Short for Rochelle is Rocky and I got my first cap out in Canada where the Rockies are. It's quite apt really,' Clark said.

Clark hopes for 'third time lucky' in 2014. 'We were really close in 2010 and it could've gone either way,' she added.

'That disappointment makes me even more hungry to win this one. I've got four years more experience to take into it.'

Clark is often compared to Jason Leonard for her longevity.

She added: 'The first goal is to win the World Cup, then the second goal will be to get 100 caps. When we come into next season and the Six Nations I'll think about that.' 

England, who were WRWC finalists in 2010, kicked off their campaign against Samoa back at the start of August and then took on Spain and Canada before making it to the final, which kicks off at 5.45pm today. 

Women’s Rugby was first played seriously in Great Britain in the late 1970s and the Women’s Rugby Football Union (WRFU) was formed in 1983. 

The first women’s International  took place in 1986 and saw Great Britain take on France. Women’s rugby has gone from strength to strength and participation is currently at an all-time high with nearly 14,000 women and girls currently registered as playing each week.
