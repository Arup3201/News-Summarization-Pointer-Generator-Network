Australia captain Michael Clarke has withdrawn from his Twenty20 commitments with the Sydney Thunder next winter due to a hectic international schedule.

The Big Bash League takes place from mid-December until late January in Australia and clashes with Australia's Test series against India and the one-day triangular series featuring Clarke's men, India and England.

The World Cup then comes hot on the heels of those events in February and Clarke has decided it would be best for the Thunder if he gave up his place in the squad.

'Having looked at the fixture list for the upcoming summer it became apparent that my opportunities to play for the Thunder would be extremely limited,' he told the club's official website.

'I think it is in the best interests of the club if I make myself unavailable for selection this season and allow the Thunder the chance to offer a contract to a younger player who would really benefit from the opportunity.

'I will continue to support the club and monitor the situation in future seasons regarding availability.'

Valuable asset: Clarke will captain Australia for their matches against India and England
