After citing the heat as a contributing factor in their loss to Costa Rica, Italy were again sweating it out on Sunday ahead of their decisive Group D match against Uruguay.

That clash on Tuesday in Natal, which will decide the second team to go through to the round of 16 with Costa Rica after England's elimination, will be in similar conditions and another 1pm local time kick-off.

Midfielder Thiago Motto claimed the Italians were at a disadvantage due to the 'crazy heat' in Arena Pernambuco in Recife, where a header from Costa Rica's Brian Ruiz was enough to hand them a defeat.

But with Tuesday's clash just north of Recife in the coastal city of Natal set to be no different coach Cesare Prandelli had his side out in the heat of the day in preparation for the match they must win or draw.

Italy captain Gianluigi Buffon admits the 1-0 loss to Costa Rica was draining, both physically and emotionally after they only just beat England courtesy of a Mario Balotelli header.

'Of
 course this time we have to carry the loss to Costa Rica as baggage and
 that could make it seem tougher than it is,' Buffon said.

Their place in the tournament is nothing new for Buffon, who is the third player to be part of five World Cup squads along with Germany great Lothar Matthaus and former Mexico goalkeeper Antonio Carbajal.

'It's really not that bad of a situation,' Buffon said Sunday. 'This is the 10th tournament I'm playing with Italy and in 10 tournaments only one time - in last year's Confederations Cup - were we already qualified by the third match ... So it's not like much has changed.'

Buffon went to the 1998 Cup though he didn't play, but he's held the starting place since 2002.

Buffon showed he could still be decisive in the third-place match of last year's Confederations Cup, when he stopped three penalties in a shootout win over Uruguay. That was after a 2-2 draw in which Edinson Cavani scored both goals for Uruguay.

And Cavani is not even Uruguay's most dangerous striker, as Luis Suarez showed when he scored both goals in a 2-1 win over England on Thursday.

'Cavani and Suarez are a great attack duo but it's not like we're just realising that now,' Buffon said. 'They have confirmed themselves for many years with the national team and individually with their clubs. It's normal when you face a squad of Uruguay's caliber that there are quality players.'

Mario Balotelli has spearheaded Italy's attack for the opening two matches but coach Cesare Prandelli could add Ciro Immobile up front against Uruguay.

Immobile led Serie A with 22 goals for Torino before completing a transfer to Borussia Dortmund, just days before flying to Brazil. But his only action thus far was in the final 17 minutes of the Azzurri's 2-1 win over England in their opening match.

'I don't think Mario and Ciro have ever played together,' Buffon said. 'It would be something new that would carry all of the associated risks - and benefits.'

Italy will also probably be without key defensive midfielder Daniele De Rossi, which could prompt coach Cesare Prandelli to revert from a four-man defense to the three-man formation employed by three-time Serie A champion Juventus. Giorgio Chiellini, Leonardo Bonucci and Andrea Barzagli - who each play for the Turin club - would fill those places.

'Our coach is always able to find the right balance in situations like this,' Buffon said. 'He's a maestro at that. ... We're definitely going to need a warm heart and a cold head. We can't throw away our self-confidence for one poor match.'

No matter what happens on Tuesday, it won't be easy for Italy.

'If we are eliminated after the first round it would be a failure,' Buffon said. 'It would be a personal disappointment and nobody would hide from that. But if we advance we're going to face hostile opponents and that's where the real problems start.'
