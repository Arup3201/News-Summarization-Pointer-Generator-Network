Accused: Rimvydas Liorancas, drinking with friends in his home town in Lithuania, was found dead in his prison cell

A Lithuanian charged with battering a retired couple to death in their home was a violent criminal who had already been kicked out of the UK.

Rimvydas Liorancas, 37, who was awaiting trial for murdering Carole and Avtar Kolar with a lump hammer, was found hanged in his prison cell on Saturday.

He had twice made his way into the UK illegally, on the second occasion without a passport.

Today it can be revealed that the convicted armed robber:

The British authorities had no idea Liorancas was even in the country until they arrested him two weeks ago.

The jobbing builder targeted Mr and Mrs Kolar, 62 and 58, after he was employed to do some work on the patio at their home in the Handsworth Wood area of Birmingham.

The couple, who were married for 40 years, were found on January 11 by their son Jason, 37, a police officer.

Liorancas was arrested five days later and charged with murder.

He was found dead in his cell at top security Woodhill jail, Milton Keynes, on Saturday before he could offer an explanation for what happened.

Tenants in the seedy Birmingham bedsit where he had been living said Liorancas was ‘a madman’ who kept a collection of hammers in his room.

Though he said he was a builder, they suspected him of being a burglar ‘or something worse’.

In fact, Liorancas was a career criminal whose string of convictions spanned a ten-year period.

The father of two came from the village of Vadzgirys, around 150 miles from the Lithuanian capital, Vilnius.

His ex-wife, Ingrida, said the muscular robber had never had a job and had been involved in crime since he left school.

‘He came from a good family, but he did nothing,’ she said. ‘He was a thief, a burglar, a robber. He would steal anything – wood, petrol, property from people’s homes.

‘He drank a lot of alcohol. Almost everyone in the countryside drinks a lot. There’s nothing else to do.

‘We were married for 11 years but he was not home very much. He used to go out drinking all the time with his friends and they would plot their next crime.

‘He would come out of jail, be free for a few months, and then be sent back again.’

She has brought up their son and daughter, now 12 and 17, alone. ‘I’m ashamed of him and so are the children,’ she said.

Ingrida divorced Liorancas in 1999, during his first stint in prison for burglary. By 2003, he was back on the prowl and convicted for an armed robbery in the Czech Republic.

He returned to his home country in 2005 to serve the rest of his lengthy sentence.

Four years later, he was granted 
parole – and immediately went on the run. When the authorities finally 
found him, he had been living in Britain undetected for almost a year. 
He had somehow made his way into this country despite being on a ‘watch’
list.

Liorancas was 
extradited back to Lithuania in 2009. Once home, he was sentenced to a 
further one year and eight months for absconding and breaking the terms 
of his release.

By 2011, he
was in trouble again, this time for leaving the scene of an accident 
and drunk driving while disqualified. But, incredibly, he was soon back 
in the UK.

Jail: Liorancas was found hanged in his cell at HMP Woodhill, near Milton Keynes, Buckinghamshire, just 12 days after he was charged with the murder of Mr and Mrs Kolar

With no right to benefits, he eked out a meagre existence in the run-down Soho Hill area of Birmingham.

Housemates said he was violent, heavy drinking, and would steal anything lying around.

Shamsher Singh said he threatened to kill him if he came into his room uninvited.

‘He was like a madman,’ Mr Singh, 28, an unemployed chef, said.

‘He pushed me very hard up against the wall and made a fist like he was going to punch me.

‘There was so much anger in his face. He was obviously a bad guy, a violent guy.’

A
month before the Kolars were murdered, Liorancas began doing some 
building work on their patio as part of a gang of Eastern Europeans.

A
family friend said: ‘It’s terrible to think he decided to attack them 
after he had been inside their house and worked for them.’

Three
weeks before the murder, Liorancas left his £40-a-week room without 
paying his rent. ‘He seemed very nervous before he left,’ Mr Singh said.
‘He didn’t say goodbye – one day he was just not there.’

Mr Singh said that although the tattooed Lithuanian was ‘not that tall’ he was very strong.

‘He had massive hands and his arm muscles were like iron,’ Mr Singh said.

Among the sea of floral tributes outside the Kolars’ semi-detached home yesterday was a photo of their youngest grandchild.

Sonni was born to their son, Avtar, and his wife Victoria, both 32, a week before they were killed.

If a monster like Rimvydas Liorancas was free to enter Britain, just what does a foreign criminal have to do to be turned away?

Inevitably, the issue is complicated by the free movement directives and edicts issued by Brussels which have eroded our border controls.

In most instances, Britain must throw its doors wide open to the citizen of a fellow EU country, even convicted criminals.

But the rules do allow the UK to turn away the worst offenders.

Liorancas, as a convicted armed robber, fell into such a category. The problem in his case is that we had no idea he was travelling to the UK. Lithuania, with other EU member states, has given an undertaking to warn us if a danger man may be heading our way so that he can be stopped from going through passport controls. 

But the system breaks down entirely when, as in the Liorancas case, the home country of the offender does not keep its side of the bargain. Chillingly, Liorancas is only the latest in a long line of Eastern Europeans to slip through the net.

Earlier this month, a senior judge demanded to know why another Lithuanian, child-rapist Victor Akulic, was let into Britain, where he went on to rape a woman. 

The Mail understands that, in this case, Lithuania again failed to inform the Home Office of his history or possible intention to travel. 

Last Friday, it emerged that a sexual predator from the Czech Republic who had murdered his wife was able to travel to the UK where he carried out a knifepoint rape and three serious sex attacks. Ministers have made one specific change to the rules which could prevent an exact repeat of the Liorancas case.

Now, whenever a person is extradited from Britain that information is passed to ACRO (ACPO Criminal Records Office) which assesses the case. If it shows a public protection risk ACRO asks the UK Border Agency to place a marker on its watchlist. 

But unless a person has been previously extradited, we remain utterly reliant on other EU member states fulfilling their obligations to warn us of any convict intending to travel.  Ultimately, they know that they have countless free movement directives on their side. Cynically,

they may even take the view that they would rather have their murderers and rapists living in Britain.What is most worrying is that it is impossible to know how many men like Liorancas are already here. And if we did not count them in, how are we to get them out?
