If something seems to good to be true in a Facebook feed, is it?

Well, when it comes to the portrayal of relationships in the social media sphere, the answer often - but not always - is yes, according to a new study.

Research from Albright College in Pennsylvania has revealed that individuals high in Relationship Contingent Self-Esteem - a type of low self-esteem centered on how your relationship is going - are more inclined to post affectionate content, such as posts acknowledging 'the best boyfriend in the world' or other declarations of happiness.

These people are also more likely to brag about their relationship, as well as monitor the Facebook activities of their partner.

Self-conscious selfie? A new study from Albright College in Pennsylvania suggests these couples may use Facebook as a way to lessen their fears of rejection and anxiety within the relationship

'These results suggest that those high in RCSE feel a need to show others, their partners and perhaps themselves that their relationship is ‘OK’ and, thus, they are OK,' said Albright assistant professor of psychology, Gwendolyn Seidman, Ph.D.

Seidman's study, working with Albright alumna Amanda Havens,  surveyed a small group of volunteers in relationships ranging from one month to 30 years, according to The Atlantic.

Participants were tested on their relationship-related Facebook habits, such as the tendency to post photos of each other and interact with their partner online.

Additionally, the participants were tested on their personalities based on five traits known to psycologists as the 'Big Five': extroversion, neuroticism, openness, agreeableness, and conscientiousness.

The research shows that introverts were more likely to use Facebook to 'show off'.

Previous studies suggest extroverts tend to be more active on social and have larger online networks.

However Seidman said extroverts might be more comfortable to share information with people face-to-face, as opposed to introverts.

Individuals high in neuroticism are also more likely to use Facebook to monitor their partner and show off their relationship.

'This is what we expected, given that neurotic individuals are generally more jealous in their romantic relationships,' Seidman said.

Other earlier studies concluded that people with a propensity to overshare online might 'just want to belong'.

However Seidman was sure to point out that, based on her current research, Facebook bragging can be legitimate, according to Newswise.

Often those declarations of happiness are just that.

'I think a lot of people think, ‘'Oh, it’s all phony'',' Seidman said.

'I think they'd be surprised to hear that it is associated with being genuinely happy in their relationships.'
