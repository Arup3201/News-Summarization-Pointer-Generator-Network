Dialling 911 to report a robbery is entirely reasonable – but if you've just had illegal substances forcibly taken from you, then don’t be surprised if the police aren’t entirely sympathetic.

Just such a scenario is said to have played out in the car park of a Taco Bell in Westlake, Ohio, last September.

Two men, Sebastian Wozniak, 20, and Anthony Klier, 22, met a group of teenagers in the parking lot to practice medieval sword fighting, but also wanted to sell them marijuana, police alleged.

Two Ohio men complained to police that they'd been the victim of a robbery, but an investigation revealed that it was their drug stash that had been taken

When the sword play finished the group climbed into a car, where Wozniak and Klier allegedly attempted to sell the teens $80 of the illegal substance.

However, one of the teens disabled Wozniak with pepper spray, grabbed the drugs and fled.

Wozniak and Klier immediately dialled 911 to report that they’d been robbed, but did not mention precisely what had been taken.

The subsequent investigation by the authorities, which consisted of phone record analysis and interviews with witnesses, led them to believe that Wozniak and Klier actually had their own drug stash swiped.

Wozniak was later charged with trafficking marijuana, obstructing justice and possessing criminal tools.

Klier faces charges of trafficking marijuana and obstructing justice, Cleveland.com reported.

Wozniak’s charges were eventually reduced to misdemeanors and he pleaded guilty to them on Tuesday at Rocky River Municipal Court.
