A kind-hearted stranger handed a £10 gift voucher to a five-year-old girl for having good manners.

Property developer Anthony Roberts, 62, was taking his granddaughter Ruby Roberts to look at the toys at an Argos store on their way home from her school in Newquay, Cornwall.

The mystery woman approached the couple and remarked on the polite, pleasant and well-behaved nature of Ruby, before presenting the youngster with the gift voucher.

Mystery: Ruby (left) was able to buy the toy doll she had wanted from Argos (right), by combining the £10 voucher with the money she had saved taking out the rubbish at a family friend’s holiday home

Mr Roberts is now trying to track down the generous gift-giver - who approached while Ruby was spelling out the names of the toys on her wishlist, but left before she could be thanked.

Ruby was able to buy the toy doll she had wanted, by combining the £10 voucher with money she had saved taking out the rubbish at a family friend’s holiday home.

Mr Roberts said that he occasionally picks up Ruby from school, and they sometimes go into Argos to look at what toys she would like from the catalogue - before she has to spell them out. 

He added: ‘A lady who had been watching Ruby came up and gave her a gift voucher after remarking how polite, pleasant and well behaved she was.

‘Ruby did not know what it was at first until I explained that’s what you get for being a nice person. I did not get the lady’s name and she was gone before we could thank her properly.

Similar recent case: The generous donation mirrors the £5 gift and a note a stranger gave single mother Samantha Welch on board a train after being impressed by her parenting of her three-year-old son Rylan

The stranger was later revealed by MailOnline to be father-of-one Ken Saunders, 50, who had handed Miss Welch and her son Rylan) the note and money at Bristol Parkway

‘Maybe, without realising it, she has taught Ruby an important lesson about being a nice person. I think it was a genuinely moving thing to do because people do not do these sorts of things now.' 

The grandfather said that he later posted what had happened on Facebook and it had a 'tremendous response'. Mr Roberts added: 'I think people are pleased nice things happen.’

The stranger was later revealed by MailOnline to be father-of-one Ken Saunders, 50, who had handed her the note and money as he got off the Birmingham-Plymouth train at Bristol Parkway.

He said he gave Miss Welch the note because she was a ‘great role model’, and said Rylan had reminded him of his own daughter Romani, now 20, when she was younger.
