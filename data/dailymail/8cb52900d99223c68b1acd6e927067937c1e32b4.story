Australian diplomats are providing consular support to an Australian man on death row in Vietnam for heroin trafficking.

Pham Trung Dung, an Australian of Vietnamese origin, was arrested in May last year when custom officials reportedly found four kilograms of heroin in his luggage as he was boarding a flight from Ho Chi Minh City to Australia.

The online newspaper VnExpress quoted Dung, 37, as telling the court in the one-day trial on Friday that he was hired by an unidentified man to transport the heroin for $40,000.

Australia's Foreign Minister Julie Bishop said Dung was receiving consular support but declined to discuss any diplomatic discussions with the Vietnamese government.

She would not comment on whether Australia had made an appeal for clemency.

'I don't want to do anything that would harm the work that is being done by our diplomats,' she said on Saturday.

The court heard Dung had been living in Australia with his partner, To Quyen, since 2000 and travelled to Vietnam with her and his two sons in 2013 to visit family.

It was in the Asian country that Dung agreed to transport two bags of luggage of heroin given to him by an acquaintance in Vietnam to take to another acquaintance in Australia.

Dung said he knew it was illegal but could not pass up the $40,000 payout, VnExpress reported.

Court officials were not available for comment on Friday.

Vietnam has some of the toughest drug laws in the world.

Drug possession or trafficking of 100 grams of heroin is punishable by death.

MailOnline has contacted Australia's Department of Foreign Affairs and Immigration for comment on the matter.
