The mayor of a German city claims Romanian and Bulgarian migrants are causing havoc, committing crimes and costing his authority close to £15million a year to house, feed and police.Soeren Link, the left-wing mayor of the former industrial city of Duisburg, close to the border with Holland, claims prostitution and robberies have spiked since the EU's latest members began arriving last year.'We are massively affected,' said the mayor, confirming the fears of the Association of German Cities which recently warned of 'social unrest' because of the economic refugees.

Problems: The mayor of Duisburg, Germany, claims Bulgarian and Romanian migrants are creating havoc in the city

'Mountains of rubbish': Soeren Link described mountains of waster 'taller than I am' outside buildings housing the city's Roma community

He spoke of rubbish mountains 
'taller than I am' outside of dilapidated housing blocks in the district
 where, in one, 400 Bulgarians and Romanians are crammed into just over 
40 apartments.

'Children are misused there and sent on stealing missions,' he claimed in a TV discussion about the problem.

Germany
 is the continent's most socially-minded nation with a lavish array of 
welfare benefits. Some Roma families are claiming over £2,000 a month in
 child welfare payments, even though they are technically not supposed 
to work in the country until January next year.

'It
 is costing us millions and will cost us more by next year,' added Mr Link, who said anyone who thought the problem was going to go away was
 'misty eyed'.

'Social unrest': The city's mayor, left, said anybody who thought the problem would simply disappear was 'misty eyed', as he told of rubbish mountains outside cramped buildings (right) housing Duisburg's Roma community

He added: 'We didn't ask for this problem and we can't handle it alone.'

On his Facebook page the mayor wrote: 'Platitude slogans and strong words do not help!'

His outspokenness earned him the 
praise of citizens including pensioner Heinz Hoffmann, 67, who said: 'If
 my rubbish spills out on the street I would be slapped with a summons 
in no time. Why do they get away with it?'

Housewife Baerbel Kramer, 57, added: 'I have sympathy for the poor people, but we are also afraid of them.'

Immigration
 mandarins in the UK believe the troubles that have befallen Germany 
will be imported when British rules are relaxed in January next year and
 Bulgarians and Romanians arrive to seek work.

'Massively affected': Duisburg's mayor claims Romanian and Bulgarian migrants are costing the city millions per year

'The social balance and social peace is extremely endangered,' reads an internal paper produced by the German Association of Cities earlier this month. Immigration from the two countries has spiked sixfold in the past few years.

The ill-educated have little or no chance of finding work while some Roma families have up to ten children and are receiving payments for each of them from the state. 'The Roma in particular', states the report, 'end up in desolate conditions once they are here'.

The knock-on effect is chaos also in classrooms where native children are being held back because the newcomers know no German.

'This is a totally new phenomenon, brought about by the euro crisis,' says Michaela Menichetti, integration commissioner for a school district in Reutlingen.

Police in several German towns report on organised Romanian crime gangs where children and women are sent out each morning with specific instructions where to steal and from whom.

One police report from Duisburg read: 'For at least a year, observations in Duisburg (but also nationally) show that Romanian groups - apparently family clans - are committing organized crimes on an alarming scale.'

In 2007 there were 31,596 immigrants into Germany from the two countries and a further 83,000 arrived in the following three years. In 2011 alone nearly 64,000 arrived from Romania and Bulgaria.
