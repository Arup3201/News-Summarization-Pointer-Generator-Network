It seems Francesco Totti woke up on the wrong side of the bed ahead of Roma's Serie A clash with Genoa on Sunday. 

Coming off the bench in the 77th minute, Totti didn't seem too happy on the touchline as midfielder Seydou Keita attempted to pass the Roma captain the skipper's armband.

Waving his hand as if to suggest Keita should turn around and get back into position, club legend Totti, who has captained the Serie A side since 1998, flatly refused his team-mate's gesture.

Later,  having replaced Adem Ljajic, the 38-year-old was in no mood to be messed around as midfielder Andrea Bertolacci showed no signs of getting to his feet following a challenge.

Stood talking to the referee with Miralem Pjanic, the frontman gave Bertolacci - a  Roma academy graduate born in the Italian capital - a gentle kick in the back, keen to get the match back up and running.

Roma won the game 1-0 courtesy of Radja Nainggolan's sumptuous volley from outside of the area five minutes before half-time.

The victory saw Rudi Garcia's men close the gap on league leaders Juventus following the Turin giants' 1-1 draw at home to high-flyers Sampdoria.
