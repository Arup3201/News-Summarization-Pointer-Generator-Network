No sooner had one regime slunk out of the back gates at Manchester United’s Carrington training ground than another was driving in through the front. Before 9am on Wednesday, Paul Scholes was back at his spiritual football home.

The story of Scholes and United this season serves, in many ways, as a window into the uncertain, unhappy world of David Moyes.

Moyes, sacked by United on Tuesday morning, thought he had offered Scholes a role last autumn and briefly the former Old Trafford midfielder worked with Nicky Butt and the Under 19s.

Old times: All coaches along with Gary Neville and David Beckham were in the 1992 FA Youth Cup Final team

Soon, though, the relationship was in 
pieces, with Scholes heading back home to Oldham under the impression 
Moyes didn’t want him.

On Wednesday morning, United’s interim manager Ryan Giggs had repaired the damage 
with a single phone call and his former team-mate was back amongst it at
 first-team training.

United’s
 technical area will begin to resemble a screen grab from the Class of 
’92 movie when Norwich arrive in the Barclays Premier League on 
Saturday.

Giggs, for his 
part, knows that his role as United manager will be a cameo. He will not
 be considered for the post at this stage and is aware the incoming 
manager — set to be foreign — may not want him either.

Between now and 
the end of the season, though, he will attempt to turn back time and it 
is hard to blame him.

Before
 telling the United squad on Tuesday afternoon that he was bringing in 
Scholes and indeed Butt, Giggs sat the players down and delivered a 
simple message.

‘Ryan was 
very straightforward, as always,’ revealed an informed source.
 ‘He told the  players it was time to go back to playing like Manchester
 United.

David Moyes was mocked by United’s players for reading a self-help book called Good to Great, and it is no wonder when you look at some of the bizarre advice it offers:

● Keep it simple — be a hedgehog, not a fox.● Achieve BHAGs — big hairy audacious goals.● Create alignment by results, not hoopla.● Avoid the Doom Loop.● 1) Get the right people on the bus. 2) Get the right people in the right seats. 3) Get the wrong people off the bus.

‘He said it was 
time to get on the front foot, to press and to start dictating games. 
Like everyone else in the room, he is fed up worrying about the 
opposition all the time.

‘He wants this team to be ruthless, brave and unforgiving, just as it used to be.’

Giggs
 — for all his understandable denials — is known to have disagreed with 
Moyes’s tactics. On more than one occasion, he tried to persuade Sir 
Alex Ferguson’s successor to change his outlook.

The
 style the 40-year-old will attempt to impose on Saturday at Old 
Trafford will owe much more to Ferguson — and indeed his first youth 
coach Eric Harrison — than it will the man who drove out through 
Carrington’s rear entrance after his dismissal.

Back to the future: Giggs has told players they will return to playing 'the Manchester United' way

In the frame: Giggs realises that Louis van Gaal and Carlo Ancelotti are favourites to take the job permanently

Giggs
 has told central midfielders including Tom Cleverley that they are not
 to sit alongside holding player Michael Carrick any more but to move 
into advanced positions and hurt the opposition when United have the 
ball.

Cleverley, who has 
struggled more than most this season, is expected to start against 
Norwich, as is another academy product, Danny Welbeck, and Adnan 
Januzaj. Not surprisingly, Giggs will jettison Marouane Fellaini and, 
more controversially, is giving thought to leaving out Juan Mata.

If
 United start without almost £60m of Moyes signings then it will 
represent a staggering indictment of the mistakes of the past eight 
months. Fellaini has been so poor that Moyes himself had started to drop
 him while Mata’s form has been lamentable since United signed him in 
January.

Respected figures 
in the game have been critical of Mata’s inability to influence games 
going against United since he moved from Chelsea and there is no way 
Giggs will select players he believes don’t have the courage to receive 
possession in difficult areas.

Mentor: Giggs will try and implement a style of play learned under his former manager Sir Alex Ferguson

Mutiny? Reports of unrest among seniors players in the United dressing room persist

On
 Saturday, Old Trafford will witness a highly motivated United team. It 
could well be that Norwich suffer. United, with nothing of worth left to
 play for, will attack the game unshackled, motivated by a desire to 
show they are better off without Moyes.

There
 remains a key group of senior players who believe Moyes has tried to 
turn public opinion against them. That is a dubious assertion. 
Nevertheless, motivated footballers can do remarkable things and it 
would be no surprise if United finish their miserable season with a 
flourish that will remind people of their true worth.

The
 United board — with the Glazers in attendance — will look on with 
interest. As they continue their efforts to turn the heads of Louis van 
Gaal and Carlo Ancelotti towards Manchester these coming days, they are 
aware that a few Giggs victories will start a bandwagon of public 
opinion in favour of the Welshman’s appointment.

Whatever
 happens, he will not get the job this time. It could, however, be fun 
watching him try and that particular commodity has been rather thin on 
the ground in Stretford this season.

On the attack: Tom Cleverley will be encouraged to take up more forward positions in United's midfield

Collateral damage: New signings Juan Mata and Marouane Fellaini could lose their places under Giggs

Make a mark: United fans would love to see Giggs get the job is he impresses in the final four games
