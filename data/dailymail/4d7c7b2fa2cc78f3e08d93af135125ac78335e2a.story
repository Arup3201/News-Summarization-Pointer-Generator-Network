Wales prop Ryan Bevington looks set to be unavailable for this season's Autumn Tests after undergoing groin surgery.

Bevington's regional team the Ospreys announced he has had an operation to correct a long-standing injury. He has not played since February.

'After Ryan suffered a setback in his recovery, we have sought opinion from some of the leading specialists in this field from across the UK,' Ospreys medical performance manager Chris Towers said.

Bevington hasn't played rugby since February of this year and will be out until at least November

'In consultation with Ryan, we have agreed that the best option for him was this surgery to correct the problem.

'An optimistic scenario would see him returning to training at the end of November.'

Bevington, 25, has won 13 caps, making his latest appearance during last season's RBS 6 Nations game between Wales and Italy.

Wales kick off their autumn campaign against Australia at the Millennium Stadium on November 8.

Bevington's last Wales cap came in a win against Italy in the Six Nations opener in February 2014
