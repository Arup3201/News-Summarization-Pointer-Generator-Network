David Cameron has joined the open revolt against John Bercow over his bid to hand a top parliamentary job to an ‘unqualified’ Australian.

The Prime Minister ridiculed the Speaker at a meeting with Tory MPs, asking whether he should now stuff the letter recommending Carol Mills for the job ‘down the back of the sofa’.

According to tradition, the Prime Minister receives a letter naming the candidate chosen for the £200,000-a-year job as Clerk of the House, and passes it on to The Queen.

Commons Speaker John Bercow has written to David Cameron recommending Carol Mills for the top job in Parliament, but has since put the plan on hold after a backlash from MPs

Since sending the letter recommending Miss Mills last month, Mr Bercow has been forced into a humiliating retreat, after dozens of MPs signed a motion questioning her suitability for the role.

A senior official at the Australian Senate, they say she may have the administrative skills to run the Palace of Westminster but has no knowledge of procedure – on which the Clerk must advise MPs.

Miss Mills has been dubbed the ‘Canberra caterer’ because her duties there involved running the Senate kitchens.

The Speaker told Parliament on Monday that he acknowledged the barrage of concerns from MPs on all sides and announced a ‘pause’ in the recruitment process.

MPs piled in later that afternoon, with eleven of them raising ‘points of order’ to question him over the issue as the Prime Minister looked on.

Last night, according to insiders at a private meeting of Tory MPs, Mr Cameron stoked the row by joking to colleagues: ‘I considered raising a couple of points of order myself’.

The Prime Minister added: ‘What am I supposed to do with the letter he’s given me? Give it to the Queen or stuff it down the back of the sofa?’.

Former transport minister Simon Burns lead the charge in Parliament today asking Mr Bercow: ‘Will you be withdrawing [the letter] until after the pause has been completed…or will it just float around in No 10 until some relevant point?’ 

'Canberra caterer': Carol Mills' appointment has been criticised by MPs from all parties and this week Mr Bercow announced he was 'pausing' the recruitment process

Carol Mills is the current Department of Parliamentary Services secretary in Canberra, Australia, a service department that supports the work of the Federal Parliament and is the principal support agency for Parliament House.

It works closely with the Department of the Senate and Department of the House of Representatives to support the operations of the Parliament and its Committees, has around 800 staff and an annual budget of around $120 million.

She is the former director general of Communities NSW and the Department of Arts, Sport and Recreation.

Miss Mills, the head of the Department of Parliamentary Services in Canberra, was selected by a panel of senior MPs led by Mr Bercow in July. Recruitment consultants had been brought in for the first time to conduct a global search for candidates.

In a face-saving move, Mr Bercow has agreed to hold a consultation on whether the post should be split. But MPs now consider it unlikely she will take up the role either way.

In his first interview since the scandal started brewing last month, Mr Bercow claimed it was ‘damning’ that none of the 84 most senior Commons officials was from an ethnic minority.

The Speaker has recommended the 650-year-old job of Clerk be split in two, with Miss Mills fulfilling the role of chief executive overseeing management, and another official to advise MPs on procedure.

But in response to criticism that the recruitment process for both jobs should then be re-run, he said he would not be ‘dying in a ditch’ to keep her if MPs did not want a chief executive.

Mr Bercow claimed the Commons clerks, steeped in parliamentary tradition, lack the experience to oversee Parliament’s £200million budget, 1,750 staff, and a major programme of restoration.

He told the Financial Times there was ‘something a tad incongruous about expecting one person to be both the procedural expert and the top-flight manager/chief executive’. 

Mr Bercow was under further pressure tonight after it emerged tonight that Tory MP Michael Fabricant has written to the Speaker claiming he had 'misled' Parliament over his plan to appoint Miss Mills.

Mr Fabricant raised a point of order in the Commons earlier today, claiming that the recruitment firm advising on the appointment of the Clerk was stopped from giving evidence about the suitability of Mills for the job.

Mr Bercow said the Tory MP was 'unfortunately, but fairly predictably' wrong.

But Mr Fabricant has insisted that the recruitment consultants Saxton Bampfylde were prevented from telling the panel advising on the appointment that Miss Mills was under two investigations by the Australian Senate.

In his letter to the Speaker, Mr Fabricant wrote: ‘Saxton Bampfylde did wish to provide further information about Ms Mills, including the fact that she is under two investigations by the Australian Senate, but this offer was rejected. You may now wish to put the record straight.’

The Clerk of the House is the impartial main political adviser to the House, and adviser on all its procedure and business.

They often appear before Select and Joint Committees to examine Parliamentary and constitutional matters.

They sit at the Table of the House, and wear court dress, with a barrister's wig and silk robes. The Clerks of the table are consulted by the Chair, Ministers, Whips, and MPs on any matter that may arise in the conduct of a sitting.

They also act as the Chief Executive of the House of Commons Service, which is made up of 2,000 people, and chairs the Management Board.

The current Clerk is Sir Robert Rogers, who has held the position since October 1, 2011, and was knighted the following year. On April 30, he announced he intended to retire at the end of August, after four decades in the House.
