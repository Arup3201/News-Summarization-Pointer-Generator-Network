When it comes to their political views, it's not too difficult to tell them apart. But when it comes to their brush strokes, spotting the difference between David Cameron and Ed Miliband might be a different story.

The Prime Minister and his political rival are just two of the famous faces who have donated their own works of art to a charity auction.

But the name of the celebrity behind the piece of work - which includes the likes of Stephen Fry, actor Danny Dyer and Sir Ian McKellen - will not be revealed until the work has been sold.

Guess who? This piece of colourful art has been painted by an anonymous artist to raise money for charity

Is this a rare glimpse into the psyche of David Cameron? More than 400 pieces of art - some painted by celebrities - will be auctioned off for St Gemma's Hospice, Leeds

A professional masterpiece or an amateur celebrity effort? The artist behind the work will not be revealed to the bidder until it has been sold

This countryside scene could have been painted by one of the celebrities who has donated their work to the cause...

...Or it might have been painted by one of the dozens of local artists who have also put their pictures up for auction

It means that art lovers will have a chance to hang a painting in their home which could have been created by one of a number of celebrities, including Brian Blessed, Katherine Jenkins and Sir Ben Kingsley. 

The Secret Art Project, which is raising money for St Gemma's Hospice in Leeds, will feature anonymous postcard-sized paintings from upcoming artists, professional painters and a host of household names. 

Other celebrities who have supplied their mini creations for the cause include actress Emma Atkins, comedian Keith Lemon and the CEO of Ann Summers, Jacqueline Gold.

Among the 400 pieces up for grabs are a picturesque depiction of cottage at dusk,  a stunning view from Westminster Bridge and several amusing sketches of animals and domestic scenes. 

There are also two scenes from TV show Emmerdale - perhaps painted by one of the three actors from the soap who have given their time to the cause. 

This scene shows the Emmerdale dressing room - hinting that it could have been produced by one of the three Emmerdale actors taking part in the auction

Another scene from the soap will be auctioned off at the secret auction - but is the artist bluffing?

The work, which includes this abstract face, pictured left, and a letter box, pictured right, will go on display at next month's Leeds Art Exhibition

The high-profile names became involved after answering the hospice's plea to create postcard-size pieces of art for an online fundraising auction

Four hundred pieces, including this humorous sketch, are up for grabs, submitted by upcoming talent, professional artists and celebrities

The high-profile names became involved after answering the hospice's plea to create postcard-size pieces of art for an online fundraising auction.

Danielle Le Cuirot, from the hospice, said she has been amazed by the response to their first 'Secret Art Project'.

She said: 'We used social media to contact celebrities — we tweeted a lot of them or went through their PR.

'Some we found contact details to got to directly. We were just trying to spread awareness.'

The art will be on display in a secret room at Leeds Art Exhibition, which opens at The Grammar School, Leeds on Thursday, October 23. The week-long bidding, which takes place on eBay, will also open on that day.
