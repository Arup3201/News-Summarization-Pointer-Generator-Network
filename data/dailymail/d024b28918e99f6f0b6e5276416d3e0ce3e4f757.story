One of the pioneering businesses of the British dotcom boom is to be put up for sale after it failed to live up to its initial promise.

Lastminute.com, founded by internet icons Brent Hoberman and Baroness Lane in 1998, was acquired in 2005 by American technology company and travel specialist Sabre.

The travel website - a former poster child of the digital revolution - was bought by Travelocity, Sabre's travel e-commerce subsidiary as a means to bolster its online holiday division in Europe.

Pioneering: Lastminute.com was co-founded by Oxford graduates Brent Hoberman and Martha Lane Fox. It was bought by American travel specialist Sabre in 2005 for £600m - earning the founders £40m

But the business has failed to live up to its original promise, despite continuing to spend significant sums on marketing and advertising - and a growing number of more flexible rivals have left it struggling.

Its biggest market shares are in the UK and France but it has struggled to make an impact elsewhere in Europe.

Sabre, which is listed in New York, has 
appointed bankers at Houlihan Lokey, an advisory firm, to oversee an 
auction, and has already begun sounding out potential buyers, according 
to Sky News.

It is understood that the US company, which floated on Nasdaq in April, is prepared to accept a substantial loss on the roughly £600million it paid for the company.

The sale comes despite an announcement made earlier this year Matthew Crummack, the 
company’s relatively new chief executive, that the the 
website would be repositioned as a leading mobile website.

Lastminute.com was one of the country's most prominent offerings during the dotcom boom of the late 1990s, promising customers a new way to book their holidays.

It floated on the stock market in 2000 - just two years after it was founded by Oxford graduates Brent Hoberman and Martha Lane Fox.

The company was originally listed at 555p on the first day of trading - at that level the company was worth more than £800m.

Soon after the dotcom bubble burst, causing internet stocks to plummet. By 2002, shares in the company were trading at just 17p.

The deal  with Sabre in 2005 gave the founders just under £40m - nearly £100m less than their shares were worth when the company went public.

Hoberman is still very much in the business of making money himself. He is chairman of trendy furniture group Made.com, which is expected to list on the stock market later this year. And he is a board member of music technology firm Shazam, Eton College, TalkTalk and Guardian Media Group.

Lane Fox , who last year was made a Baroness, founded karaoke business Lucky Voice and sits on the board at Marks & Spencer.

The entrepreneur broke 28 bones in a car accident in Morocco which nearly killed her.

The impact smashed her pelvis in six places, shattered her right arm and right leg, caused severe internal bleeding and led to her having a stroke.

She was only released from hospital in England after six months of gruelling operations - in total, she had 28 procedures.
