A mother and daughter who starved their pet dog so badly he was left as only 'skin and bone' have been banned for keeping animals for five years.

Rosemary Robinson, 41, and daughter Rachel, 19, starved their pointer cross, named George, to the point where he was able to tuck his knees under his ribcage.

Hastings Magistrates Court heard that the pet was also covered in sores, and was suffering from a lung condition due to a lack of worming.

Rosemary Robinson, 41, and daughter Rachel, 19, have been banned from keeping any animals for five years after starving pet pointer cross George

The dog was so emaciated he was able to tuck his back legs up under his ribcage, and was also covered in sores and masses, according to the RSPCA

George was in such a bad state and living in such pain that vets were forced to put him down. 

Neither of the owners, from St Leonards-on-Sea, East Sussex, turned up to the hearing, and so were sentenced in their absence to a multitude of animal welfare offences.

Rosemary was also given a community order for six months, a six month curfew and made to pay £1,063 costs and fines.

Rachel was handed a 12-month community order, 100 hours unpaid work and ordered to pay £763 in costs and fines.

The RSPCA was called with concern in February after George was finally taken to a vet.

George was also suffering from a lung condition due to a lack of worming, and was in such constant pain that vets had to put him down

Ms Robinson and her daughter failed to appear at their court hearing and so were sentenced in their absence to a multitude of animal abuse charges

One RSPCA worker said that George's condition was only discovered after the owners eventually took him to the vet, and concerned staff called them

RSPCA inspector Zoe Ballard said: 'George was one of the thinnest dogs I have ever seen and had clearly been deteriorating and suffering for some time.

'As well as being emaciated he had lumps and masses all over his body and was suffering from a chronic lung condition caused by lack of worming.

'He had deteriorated to such an extent that he was living in constant pain - It was obvious at first glance that he should have been taken to a vet a long time before.'
