A Massachusetts woman has admitted to having married three men in the same year to help them stay in the United States in exchange for cash.

Prosecutors say when Melissa Ann Lewis, 42, of Worcester made her wedding vows to a Kenyan man in 2006, she was already legally married to a Ghanaian man and a Chinese.

Lewis pleaded guilty on Thursday in U.S. District Court to two counts of fraud and misuse of immigration visas.

She signed a plea agreement admitting having 'entered into three sham marriages for money and to obtain immigration benefits for the three husbands,' the Telegram and Gazette reports.

The amount of money earned from the courtships was not released.

Prosecutors say Lewis took out marriage licenses in Worcester, Southbridge and Pawtucket, R.I.

Two of the men, George Asante from Ghana and Hai Tao Mo, from China, were both wed to her just days apart in January of 2006.

Her wedding to the Kenyan was in October that same year.

Stating his case before the judge, Assistant U.S. Attorney Thomas E. Kanwit said there was no courtship before the marriages nor intention of living together as husband and wife after.

Prosecutors say the men wanted to use the marriages to convince federal immigration officials to allow them to stay in the United States.

Lewis scheduled to be sentenced this fall.

She faces a $250,000 fine and up to 10 years in prison for each charge.

Prosecutors have recommended a reduced sentence with her cooperation and taking 'personal responsibility.'
