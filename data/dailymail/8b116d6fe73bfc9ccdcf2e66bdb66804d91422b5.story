Meet Valentina - the playful new arrival at the Attica Zoological Park in Greece.

And the two-month old puma cub is already showing signs of a feisty character by biting her zookeeper on the nose during feeding time.

She is one of several newly-born Big Cats to have arrived at the zoo so far this spring.

A baby lion cub called Akinta was also born three weeks ago.

Pumas originate from the American continent anywhere from Southern Canada to Central America and down to Patagonia.

They eats a wide variety of prey including as deers, mountain goats and llamas and can leap up to 16ft in the air.Â 

A female puma will usually give birth to two or three cubs, but sometimes up to 5 or even 6, who will stay with their mother for about a year.

Pumas can live in in many different habitats, from sea level to as high as 5,900m but are shy animals, preferring to hunt at dawn and sunset.

Their population is declining but the species status is of least concern.
