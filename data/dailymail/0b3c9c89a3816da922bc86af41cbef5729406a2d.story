Like many youngsters, Ellie Clark loves messing around on a piano.

At four, she has already mastered Twinkle Twinkle Little Star, her favourite nursery rhyme, an achievement of which her parents are understandably proud.

But what makes Ellie’s musical ability all the more impressive is that she can’t see the keys – because she is blind.

Ellie Clark, aged four, who despite being registered as blind, has learned to play the piano and her favourite nursery rhyme 'Twinkle, Twinkle Little Star' 

At just seven months old she was diagnosed with Leber’s Congenital Amaurosis, a condition which means her retina doesn’t process light.

However her parents Kate and Chris were determined that the disability was not going to hinder her development, and introduced her to the piano as a toddler.

‘When we got the piano she was a natural,’ said Mr Clark, 31, who works as a systems analyst. ‘It gave her a way to communicate. 

As well as learning to play the piano, Ellie is also learning how to read and write in braille and already knows the alphabet

'Social interaction is very difficult for a visually impaired child but this gives her something she can relate to.’

Ellie enjoyed playing around with the piano but when formal lessons began a year ago she was more hesitant. 

‘It was a couple of months before Ellie gave it a go,’ said Mrs Clark, 30, who gave birth to their second daughter, Kiera May, last month.

‘At first she would just listen or sing along. She has come so far in a year – she has absolutely perfect pitch.’

Ellie plays in the garden with her father in the family home in Sawtry, Cambridgeshire. She was diagnosed with a retina disorder at the age of seven months

Mrs Clark, who works for charity Blind Children UK, said Ellie now gathers the family round the piano so she can play Twinkle Twinkle Little Star. 

‘It is definitely something that has helped her confidence,’ she said at the family home in Sawtry, Cambridgeshire.

‘And the structure of lessons will help her with school work in the future.’

Ellie has also been learning Braille for the past six months and already knows the alphabet. Her parents are also taking lessons so they can help her through her education.

LCA is a degenerative condition, though it is hoped gene therapy could help those affected in future.
