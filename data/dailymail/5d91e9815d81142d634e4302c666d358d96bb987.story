A family have spoken of their joy at finally being reunited with their beloved dog four years after she disappeared.

Asia the husky was found wandering along a highway on the outskirts of Chicago 825 miles away from her owners in Grand Prairie, Texas.

The Long family's two puppies China and Asia were stolen from their backyard in Grand Prairie, Texas, in September 2008.

Asia the husky dog has finally returned home four years after she went missing from her home in Grand Prairie, Texas

China was returned in 2010 after being found in the town of Saginaw, Texas, about an hour and 45 minutes drive from their home.

And this week Asia was driven back from Chicago leaving her owners wondering what sort of adventures she had been up to over the last four years.

Twyla Long told ABC News. 'It was a huge sense of relief.

'We wish we could be a little speck on her brain so we could know what she has seen in the last four years and what she has been through.

'She came in our house last night and she went right to the back door like she knew the back door was there,' Long told ABC News Monday.

'She's not so friendly with her sister right now. They're irritated with each other but we're working them slowly back together.'

Mrs Long, 33, had rescued China and Asia from Fort Worth Animal shelter as pups days before they were due to be put down.

The family already had a husky dog and Mrs Long had a tough job persuaded her husband to adopt another two.

'The day they were scheduled to be euthanized I begged my husband and he said OK,' Mrs Long recalls. 'I said, "Great, I'm sitting in their lobby now."'

Luckily both dogs were microchipped as part of the adoption fee from the shelter.

Mr and Mrs Long and their four children quickly fell in love with the two puppies and were left devastated when they were taken.

Mrs Long said: 'Every time they [her children] would see a Siberian husky they wanted to scan it for a microchip.

'They wanted to make sure it wasn't China or Asia.'

Long's 15-year-old son also volunteered at the animal shelter in Grand Prairie so that he could check any Siberian huskies that came through to see if they were China or Asia.

'We knew that one day we would find them and they would come back home,' Long said.

The family used the company Dog Runner Transport, who drove from West Virginia to Chicago to pick up Asia and bring her home.
