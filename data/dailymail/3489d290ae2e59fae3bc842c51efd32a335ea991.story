Detectives on the New South Wales far north coast have identified a woman found dead in dunes on Tallow Beach this morning and are currently notifying next-of-kin.

A member of the public came across the gruesome find on sand dunes at Tallow Beach around 11.20am and told police immediately.Â 

Police responding to the discovery said there were no initial clues about how the woman, believed to be aged in her 20s or 30s, died. Her death was later confirmed as not suspicious.

'We just can't say one way or another,' a NSW police spokesman said.

'There's nothing obvious either way.'
