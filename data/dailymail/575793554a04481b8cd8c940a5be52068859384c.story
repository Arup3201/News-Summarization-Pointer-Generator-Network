A Nasa spacecraft has caught a glimpse of something we've long suspected was there, but could never see - the tail of our solar system.

Scientists have long predicted that our solar system has a tail much like a comet, as it moves through space causing a stream of particles to trail behind it.

But now their theory has been proved correct after Nasa's Interstellar Boundary Explorer (IBEX) spacecraft has mapped the first view of the tail, which follows the heliosphere, or our solar 'bubble'.

Scroll down for video...

This diagram shows the sun - the white dot in the center of the circle which represents the inner heliosphere encompassing the entire solar system. A tail of particles flows to the right of the heliosphere. The elongated shape in light blue is the outer heliosphere, the region where the sun still has a small amount of influence

Our solar system can be likened to a meteor traveling through Earth’s atmosphere, which causes the particles to form a stream trailing off behind it.

IBEX has mapped the boundaries of the tail of the heliosphere, something that has never before been possible.

Scientists described this tail, called the heliotail, in The Astrophysical Journal.

By combining observations from the first three years of IBEX imagery, the team mapped out a tail that shows a combination of fast and slow moving particles.

Nasa said that there are two 'lobes' of slower particles on the sides, faster particles above and below, with the entire structure twisted, as it experiences the pushing and pulling of magnetic fields outside the solar system.

'By examining the neutral atoms, IBEX made the first observations of the heliotail,' said David McComas, lead author on the paper and principal investigator for IBEX at Southwest Research Institute in San Antonio, Texas.

'Many models have suggested the heliotail might be like this or like that, but we’ve had no observations.

'We always drew pictures where the tail of the heliosphere just disappears off the page, since we couldn’t even speculate about what it really looked like.'

Telescopes have previously spotted similar tails around other stars but it has been difficult to see whether our star also has one.

Scientists came close to viewing it before when Pioneer 10 crossed the orbit of Neptune in 1983, but annoyingly it lost power 20 years later before it moved into the tail.

IBEX however, maps regions by measuring neutral particles created by collisions at the heliosphere’s boundaries.

Eric Christian, IBEX mission scientist at NASA’s Goddard Space Flight Center in Greenbelt, Maryland, said: 'Using neutral atoms, IBEX can observe far away structures, even from Earth orbit.'

Other stars show tails that trail behind them like a comet¿s tail. Scientists used NASA¿s Interstellar Boundary Explorer to confirm that our solar system has one too. From top left and going counter clockwise, the stars shown are: LLOrionis, BZ Cam and Mira

'IBEX scans the entire sky, so it has given us our first data about what the tail of the heliosphere looks like, an important part of understanding our place in and movement through the galaxy.'

Scientists are using the map to try and understand more about the charged particles that form the heliotail and the solar wind that blows out from the sun.

'The tail is our footprint on the galaxy, and it’s exciting that we’re starting to understand the structure of it, said Professor Christian.

'The next step is to incorporate these observations into our models and start the process of really understanding our heliopshere.'

Scientists can test their computer simulations of the heliosphere against the new observations and improve their models.

Together, data from instruments in space and analysis at labs on the ground will continue to improve our understanding of the comet-like tail streaming out behind us.

This data from NASA's Interstellar Boundary Explorer shows what it observed looking down the solar system's tail. The yellow and red colours represent areas of slow-moving particles, and the blue represents the fast-moving particles

They believe that the tail is 'our footprint on the galaxy' and that the map will help us better understand the structure of our solar system
