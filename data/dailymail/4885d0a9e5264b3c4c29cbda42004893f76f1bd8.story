Andy Murray may still be two wins away from a third consecutive Wimbledon final but already ticket prices for Sunday’s showpiece have soared to £13,600 on online secondary ticket exchange Viagogo.

Even tickets for  Murray’s quarter-final today against Grigor Dimitrov were selling for £3,000.

Best defence: Andy Murray's potential return to the final has seen tickets rise to £13,600

Jamie Murray made it clear last week that his priority was the men’s doubles rather than the mixed doubles here.

But once again the Scot failed to make it past the third round as he and Australian partner John Peers were beaten in a five-set thriller by second seeds Alexander Peya and Bruno Soares. There are now no British representatives in the men’s or women’s doubles.

Britain enjoyed junior success as Glasgow 16-year-old Maia Lumsden knocked out American second seed Catherine Cartan Bellis in three sets in the first round of the girls’ singles.

Lumsden’s fellow Scot Isabelle Wallace also progressed, as did Gabriella Taylor, who two weeks ago beat world No 29 Sofia Arvidsson in qualifying for the senior event.

Still got it! Former champion Martina Hingis won her first match at SW19 since 2007

Martina Hingis rolled back the years as the 1997 Wimbledon champion won her first match at the All England Club since 2007 in her mixed doubles opener.

The 33-year-old  teamed up with Brazilian Bruno Soares to beat Nicolas Monroe and Shuai Zhang. Brits Neal Skupski and Naomi Broady also progressed by beating David Marrero and Arantxa Parra-Santonja, but Dominic Inglot and Johanna Konta went out.

American Francis Tiafoe, the son of Sierra Leone immigrants, is one of the hottest prospects in the States and opened his boys’ singles campaign with victory over Martin Blasko.

The 16-year-old is loving his time in London and was thrilled when Andy Murray had a chat with him. Tiafoe now hopes to meet his mum’s UK-based sister for the first time since he was three.

Going green: Eric Bana, who played the Incredible Hulk, was slightly confused over Wimbledon dates

Representatives of Australian actor Eric Bana, who starred in Hulk, are understood to have contacted the All England Club to let them know he would be interested if any tickets were available on July 9 or 10.

The Championships finish on July 6.
