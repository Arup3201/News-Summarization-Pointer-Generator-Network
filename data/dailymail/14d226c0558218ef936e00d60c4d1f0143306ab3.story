Arsene Wenger has challenged Jack Wilshere to step up and to assume responsibility as a senior player this season saying that the Arsenal midfielder can no longer be considered a young starlet.

Wenger believes that Wilshere has been held back by his ankle injury in the past and now that is no longer a worry, he should deliver consistently throughout the season.

But the pictures of Wilshere smoking on his recent break in Las Vegas also led to a pre-season meeting with Wenger and reprimands, with the midfielder since apologising for his behaviour.

And Wenger sees this as a crucial season for Wilshere, who only played a fringe role in England’s World Cup, coming on as a sub against Italy and starting the dead rubber match against Costa Rica.

Wenger said: ‘He’s 22 and with the experience he has I don’t consider him anymore as a guy who is just starting the game. I consider him as a player. He has the experience. For him the problem until now was medical. I think he’s over it now. It’s the first time I’ve seen him not miss a session since the start of the preparations. It’s an important year for Jack: very important.

Wilshere is in danger of missing out of Arsenal’s first eleven with Araon Ramsey, Santi Cazorla and Mesut Ozil all likely to be ahead of him with Mikel Arteta and Mathieu Flamini favoured for more defensive roles but Wenger says that he has the ability to match the progress Ramsey made last season, when the Welshman transformed himself into being Arsenal’s most important player.

‘I wish that he does that because if the two work together at that level we have a very strong midfield. He was until now a doubt a little bit through injuries. At top-level you need to be consistent with your presence. 

'You can play six, seven, eight games and rest one or two but you have to play six, seven on the trot. I think he will be capable of doing it. He prepares well. He has no ankle problem anymore. It could be his year.’

Wilshere could start the Community Shield against Manchester City today with Ozil not returning to the club until Monday after winning the World Cup with Germany, though Wenger may yet prefer Tomas Rosicky.

And former Arsenal captain Tony Adamas has also challenged Wilshere to prove himself this season. ‘He must show more hunger and professionalism,’ said Adams. ‘He’s in danger of not fulfilling his potential and his career could be over in the blink of an eye.

‘If push came to shove, for a cup final or a big match, Arsene would pick Ozil ahead of Jack. He should have taken it as a personal insult that Arsenal went out and signed Ozil when they already had the same talent at their disposal in him.’ Paul Scholes also criticised Wilshere last season saying that he had not improved in five years.
