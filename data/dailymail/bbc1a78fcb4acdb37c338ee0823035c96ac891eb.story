The family of a blind woman who killed her healthy guide dog so it could be buried alongside her have suffered a hate campaign and received death threats, it was revealed today.

Shelia Stadler, 68, from Terre Haute, Indiana, died of cancer with her five-year-old guide dog Toffee by her side last month.

A few days later later her son Andy had the healthy dog put down so it could placed in Mrs Stadler's coffin to fulfil her dying wish.

But the controversial decision to destroy the dog has provoked a huge backlash in the town with Mrs Stadler's son receiving death threats - and even suffering abuse from members of his own family.

'How could they do it?' Gregory Reilly from the Honey Creek Animal Hospital was wrongly implicated as having put the dog down, and believes the decision to do so was questionable

Gregory Reilly, a veterinary assistant with the local Honey Creek Animal Hospital, said: 'It got totally out of control. The neighborhood was really angry. People were saying they should burn in hell. Terrible things were said.

'Mr Stadler told me he had received death threats and a member of his own family wrote on a Facebook page that she could not believe he had done it.'

Mr Reilly was also caught up in the furore after being blamed wrongly for putting Toffee down.

He said: 'We would never euthanise a dog - we simply find them a new home. All I did was try to find out whether what the Stadler's did was legal.

'It seems very morbid to me but unfortunately as the dog was their property, it was perfectly legal.'

Mrs Stadler died on March 8, and had expressed a wish to her family that she should be buried with her beloved labrador Toffee.

Her son Andrew, a tax accountant, then carried out her instructions after saying the dog had shown signs of mourning and 'wandered aimlessly' in the days after Mrs Stadler died.

It is not known when Toffee was euthanized but the story first emerged on WTHITV, which stated: 'Shelia Stadler, 68, of Brazil, died March 8 at home with her service animal, Toffee, at her side.

'Days later, the Stadler family had Toffee, a perfectly healthy 5-year-old dog, euthanized, displayed in the coffin at Shelia’s visitation, and buried with her in Summit Lawn Cemetery right outside Brazil.'

In mourning: DeBaun Funeral Homes and Crematory's obituary said that Toffee had been Sheila's 'constant companion for five years'

It cited an obituary saying: 'She loved Toffee, her seeing-eye dog and constant companion for five years.'

But when the report provoked a storm of criticism against Mrs Stadler's family, station boss Todd Webber withdrew the story from the website and refused to comment on the reasons why.

Mr Reilly said: 'The family and the station have taken a lot of heat on this. There was a Facebook page with so much criticism on that they had to take it down.'

The Dogs Trust said:  'There is never any reason to put a
 healthy dog to sleep when it could be happily rehomed.

'We hope that 
this sad story could never be repeated in the UK.

Guide Dogs UK also made it 
clear that this case was unacceptable.

Oliver Barton, regional director, said: 'We would never condone this. Whatever happens, we would make sure that the dog was happy and cared for'

Paying tribute to Mrs Stadler, the 
DeBaun Funeral Home refused to comment on its involvement in displaying the euthanized dog but said that she had been a 'dedicated homemaker' whose
 favourite book was the Bible.

Mrs Stadler is not the only owner to request such a burial in recent years.

NBC reported that Tom Tom, a healthy 2-year-old Yorkshire terrier was put down so that he could be buried with his owner, Donald Ellis from Arkansas.

His sister said that she had 'a lot of grief for doing this, but it’s what my brother wanted.'

Emily Kinney from Dallas, Texas told NBC that her grandmother asked for her Shih-tzu Sam to be buried in her coffin. She said that 'she wanted her best friend with her'.
