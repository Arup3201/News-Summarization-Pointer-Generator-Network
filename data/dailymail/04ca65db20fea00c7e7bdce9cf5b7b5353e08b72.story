In a move that may ease — or exacerbate — spiraling tensions with Israel over a potential Iran nuclear deal, the White House has decided against snubbing America's leading pro-Israel lobby and will send President Barack Obama's National Security Adviser Susan Rice and U.N. Ambassador Samantha Power to the annual policy conference.

The American Israel Public Affairs Committee announced Thursday that Rice and Power would speak at its conference that begins this weekend, and the White House's top spokesman confirmed their attendance at his daily briefing.

The White House's decision to name Rice as one of its liaisons is a tacit acknowledgement of its support for remarks she made earlier this week claiming that House Speaker John Boehner and Israeli Prime Minister Benjamin Netanyahu had 'injected a degree of partisanship' into the relationship between the two countries when they planned a Washington visit for the world leader without first notifying the Obama administration. 

The White House has decided against snubbing America's leading pro-Israel lobby and will send President Barack Obama's National Security Adviser Susan Rice to speak to the group. The White House's decision to name Rice as one of its liaisons is a tacit acknowledgement of its support for remarks she made earlier this week claiming that House Speaker John Boehner and Israeli Prime Minister Benjamin Netanyahu had 'injected a degree of partisanship' into the relationship between the two countries

Rice, appearing on a PBS program when she made the assertion, said the move was 'destructive to the fabric of the relationship' between Israel and the United States.

Asked about her comments on Wednesday afternoon, a spokesman for the White House claimed Rice's comments were consistent with the administration's past statements.

Rice, a top national security adviser to the president, was simply making the argument that 'reducing the U.S.-Israeli relationship to just a relationship between two political parties is destructive to a relationship between our two countries,' the spokesman, Eric Schultz contended.

'The President himself has raised this concern.'

Moments later, Schultz said, 'So what we hope is that we'll continue to see leadership in this country and in Israel that will not allow the relationship between our two countries to be dragged down by party politics.'

For generations 'both countries have succeeded in not allowing this critically important international relationship to get buffeted by those kinds of political arguments' that the president believes could be harmful to both countries' national security, Schultz said.

Rice, however, appeared to be engaging in the same kind of 'destructive' behavior that the White House has said it is seeking to avoid.

U.S. officials had floated the idea of sending a non-Cabinet level official to the event to show the administration's deep displeasure with Netanyahu over his speech to Congress next week, in which he will argue against an Iran deal but decided against and on Thursday said it would offer up Rice and Power.

In their as-yet unscheduled appearances at the AIPAC conference that runs from Sunday to Tuesday, Rice and Power will stress the importance of the U.S.-Israel relationship and the administration's commitment to Israel's security, according to American officials.

But, they will also make the administration's case for the ongoing negotiations with Iran before an audience of more than 16,000 pro-Israel activists that is likely to be hostile to the talks and deeply concerned by growing animosity between Obama and Netanyahu and their top aides over the prime minister's speech and his opposition to one of the president's signature foreign policy goals.

In a break with protocol, the invitation for Netanyahu to speak was orchestrated by Republican congressional leaders without input from the White House or State Department, angering senior administration officials who believe it was politically motivated. Netanyahu declined an invitation to meet privately with Democratic members of Congress and a number of Democrats have said they will not attend the speech.

No senior U.S. officials will meet Netanyahu during his trip to Washington. The administration has said the visit is too close to Israel's upcoming elections and it doesn't want to demonstrate any favoritism. 

Both Vice President Joe Biden and Secretary of State John Kerry will be out of the country for the visit's duration on travel that was organized only after the prime minister's trip was announced.

The White House is also sending U.N. Ambassador Samantha Power to the annual policy conference in an apparent effort to try to tamp down an increasingly vitriolic back-and-forth between the U.S. and its top Mideast ally. But, it is not at all clear if it will have that effect

The administration's choice of Rice and Power to address the AIPAC conference, at which Netanyahu will also speak, is an apparent effort to try to tamp down an increasingly vitriolic back-and-forth between the U.S. and its top Mideast ally. But, it is not at all clear if it will have that effect. 

After Rice's remarks on Charlie Rose's PBS program, Kerry openly questioned Netanyahu's judgment in opposing a potential Iran deal, recalling his support for the 2003 Iraq war and prediction that it would bring stability to the Middle East. 

'He may have a judgment that just may not be correct here,' the secretary told a congressional hearing.

White House spokesman Josh Earnest said Wednesday that sending Cabinet members to speak at the annual policy conference was consistent with the administration's participation in the past, other than the two times Obama spoke himself, and that scheduling the speeches this close to the conference wasn't unusual.

'Certainly if it's perceived by some as an effort to demonstrate bipartisan support for the relationship between the United States and Israel, that would be great,' he told reporters.

At a Capitol Hill news conference on Thursday, House Speaker John Boehner rejected Rice's criticism, arguing that a 'bad deal' with Iran would be counterproductive.

'The president's national security adviser says that it's destructive for the prime minister of Israel to address the United States Congress next week. I couldn't disagree more,' Boehner told reporters. 

'The American people, and both parties in Congress, have always stood with Israel. Nothing and no one should get in the way of that.'

That's why it is 'so important for the American people to hear what Prime Minister Netanyahu has to say about the grave threats that they're facing,' Boehner continued. 'So I'm glad the prime minister is coming and I'm glad that most of my colleagues, Democrats and Republicans, will be there to hear what he has to say.'

Rep. Nita Lowey spoke to Netanyahu earlier this month and suggested that he deliver his speech in the congressional auditorium behind closed doors, a venue that accommodates all lawmakers and would allow for any classified information that Israel might have on Iran's capabilities, according to a senior House lawmaker.

That alternative was also presented to Israeli Ambassador Ron Dermer in private meeting earlier this month with a half dozen Jewish House Democrats.

So far, no changes to his speech have been made, however, and it scheduled to be broadcast to the public.
