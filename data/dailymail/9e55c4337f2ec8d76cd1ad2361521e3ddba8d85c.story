A video posted on the Facebook page of a British-trained doctor appears to show victims of a Syrian regime assault on Aleppo foaming at the mouth and showing symptoms consistent with a chemical weapons attack.

Experts believe that chemical weapons may have been dropped on Kurdish residents of Aleppo's Sheikh Massoud region during an attack which saw two babies and a woman killed earlier this month.

It is thought that the April 13 assault may have been in revenge for residents' decision to defect to support the rebels.

Claims that the regime has regularly used banned materials against rebels were also made by Israeli general, Brigadier General Itai Brun, according to the Daily Telegraph.

The video was posted on the Facebook page of British-trained doctor Niazi Habash, who treated some of the Aleppo victims.

He said that they displayed symptoms of chemical exposure including foaming at the mouth, constricted pupils and difficulty breathing.

They were treated using chemical weapons antidote Atropine, Dr Habash claims.

Experts claim that their injuries appear to be similar to those suffered by victims of an attack on Khan al-Assad, near Aleppo.

In the April 13 assault, 15 people were injured.

Four-month-old Yehia, 18-month-old Abu Bakr Younis and adult Ghadeer Neddaf all died from their injuries.

The most likely chemical to have been used is sarin according to former British Army specialist and director Hamish de Bretton-Gordon.

He told the Telegraph: From what we've seen and the descriptions of the containers being dropped from the air, it certainly seems that the regime is using sarin in an unprepared state in these attacks.

'But, as in the Tokyo subway bombings, sarin does not need to be weaponised and placed in missiles to kill.

'It is still lethal when people are exposed to it.'

US President Barack Obama and Western leaders had warned Bashar al-Assad that using chemical weapons would be crossing a 'red line'.

But the latest claim that such weapons have been deployed by the regime is the fourth in recent months.

UK Foreign Secretary William Hague revealed last week that a soil sample taken from Khan al-Assad had tested positive for a chemical agent.

Mr Hague said that the UK will try and tear up an EU arms embargo next month so that weapons can be supplied to Syrian rebels and said that both Britain and France want to be able to 'take urgent action' should future atrocities take place.

The UK will send 34 vehicles, including five armoured 4x4s and 20 sets of body armour to those seeking to overthrow dictator Bashar al-Assad.

But critics warned that arming the rebels will be especially problematic because many opposition groups have been hijacked by Al Qaeda supporters.

The Obama administration opposes directly arming Syrian opposition fighters, in part out of fear that the weapons could fall into the hands of Islamic extremists.

And Syria's president al-Assad warned the West will pay a price 'in the heart' of Europe and the U.S. for their alleged backing Islamic fundamentalists in his country's civil war.

The European Union's security chief has also warned today that young Europeans fighting alongside rebels to bring down President Assad, will be 'radicalised' and could pose a 'serious threat' to national security when they return home.

It is feared some will become members of groups with links to al-Qaeda before launching terror attacks at home.

Syria is thought by the CIA to have a large stockpile of chemical weapons and both the rebels and Assad's regime have accused each other of using them.

Fears have grown in recent months for the safety of the stockpile, thought to include sarin and mustard gas that can be deployed using aircraft, ballistic missiles and artillery rocket.

It is also believed that Syria has attempted to develop more toxic nerve agents.

Sarin is a more sophisticated successor to Zyklon B which was used by the Nazis in the extermination of millions of Jews in Hitler's death camps.

It is like some farm pesticides but does not occur naturally and cannot occur naturally.

Saddam Hussein used it in the late 80s against Kurdish rebels and it was behind the death of the entire population of Halabja.

It is so toxic that a drop the size of a pin prick is enough to kill and it is heavier than air so it hovers close to the ground maximising casualties.

Fumes from the colourless, odourless liquid last longer the warmer the environment so the constant 25Â°C on Tokyo's subway provided the perfect condition.

Sarin attacks the vegal nervous system and victims die within minutes either through respiratory failure or a heart attack as they choke on their own mucus or saliva.
