They are meant to provide affordable homes for families who can’t get on the property ladder.

But last night a housing association was accused of gazumping its own customers – after hiking the price of their flats by up to 50 per cent before they had even had the chance to move in.

Dozens of first-time buyers had paid their deposits and were waiting for the deals to be completed.

But they were left high and dry after the state-funded housing association behind the development increased the prices – in some cases, by up to £150,000 – to ‘take advantage’ of spiralling property values.

High and dry: Buyers outside the development in Streatham, south London, who faced huge price hikes

Wandle housing group, which rents out thousands of state-subsidised homes, made a U-turn last night and dropped its prices back to the level agreed with its buyers late last year.

But critics accused the group, which is meant to help the less well-off to get homes, of trying to play the housing market to boost its income.

Housing Minister Kris Hopkins said: ‘This is unfair, sharp practice by the housing association. The would-be buyers put down a deposit in good faith, and have been treated badly by Wandle due to their delays and failure to communicate.’

The association offered a share in 34 homes in the south London suburb of Streatham.

Buyers would pay rent but also take out a mortgage to buy a stake in their flats.

Wandle has been given £25million of taxpayers’ money in the past two years to help pay for the development. According to its accounts, it holds assets worth nearly half a billion pounds.

But last week it raised the prices of the flats steeply – in some cases, by more than 50 per cent in six months. One stake in a flat for which a buyer agreed to pay £267,000 was pushed up to more than £400,000.

The conflict came as fears grow over a housing bubble, with property prices soaring across the country

Customers were told of the move by letter. The housing association explained that there were ‘significant changes in the London property market which are beyond our control’.

London house prices have risen by 17 per cent in the past year, with the average price of a home in the capital now £459,000.

The flats were meant to be affordable housing and those who were offered them qualified under the association’s rules as people deserving of state help.

The buyers put down £500 deposits in December and were told the deals on their flats would be completed in March.

However last week they received the letters, explaining that the terms of their agreements had been altered.

One buyer of a two-bedroom flat was told her £245,000 stake was now going to cost £355,000. Another couple who agreed to pay £267,000 found that the price had become £417,000.

On average the increases amounted to £55,000 for a one-bedroom flat and £115,000 for a two-bedroom unit.

Sales analyst Guy Morris, 44, saw the £260,000 price he had agreed for a half share of a flat  increase to £383,000.

He told London’s Evening Standard that the housing association ‘behaved like mercenaries’. He added: ‘Wandle is taking advantage of the house price boom. I don’t know how else to explain it. They have seen an opportunity to get as much money out of us as possible.’

The price increases came after delays at the development which means that flats will not be ready for occupation until the end of the summer.

Yesterday morning Wandle, whose chief executive Sara Thakkar earns around £150,000 a year, said it was obliged to boost the prices.

‘Unfortunately external market movement has resulted in substantial increases to the value of these homes in a relatively short period of time,’ said a spokesman.

But its policy changed during the day as ministers made their disapproval clear and protests were made to the Greater London Authority.

Last night, Wandle apologised to its buyers, saying: ‘We are very sorry for the uncertainty this situation has caused to our prospective purchasers this week.’
