A disgruntled News Corp employee has tried to embarrass boss Rupert Murdoch on the eve of the company's 50th birthday celebrations for The Australian by parking a clapped-out old car plastered with bizarre notes out the front of his Sydney headquarters.

In a brazen protest, the employee parked a car out the front of the company's headquarters in Surry Hills, Sydney, with letters stuck on its windows on behalf of the 'journalists, photographers and artists' of the company, criticising pay and conditions.

It also questions recent financial decisions made at the company's headquarters, including a new $60 million publishing system that many employees either don't know how or refuse to use more than a year after its implementation.

The notes attack the company's managers by claiming they are imposing 'a pay cut in real terms' that will hurt staff and force them to give up 'various allowances and conditions'.

The letter was written and addressed to Rupert Murdoch on the eve of one of News Corp's biggest celebrations of the year - The Australian's 50th birthday

The protest car seen parked out the front of the Holt Street company by media website Mumbrella at about 7.30am on Monday was parked there in the hope that Mr Murdoch would see it as he came to the office this morning.

Mr Murdoch, who is in Sydney for celebrations to mark The Australian's 50th anniversary tomorrow night, gave an interview in which he hit out at climate change and described Prime Minister Tony Abbott as someone the public could look up to and admire.

Mr Abbott once worked as a journalist at The Australian.

But while the 50th birthday bash is expected to attract a host of dignitaries - including Mr Abbott - the party was clearly the last thing on the mind of the disgruntled staffer who parked the protest car in front of the News Corp building.

Another letter posted on the rear of the vehicle claims the journalist cannot afford to upgrade their ageing vehicle.

'Yes I know! I should be retired,' the letter reads.

'But my owner is a journalist at News Corp. They want to cut his pay in real terms and slash his conditions. So he can’t afford to replace me, and I have to work until I drop. Liberty.”

A poster from the journalists union, the Media Entertainment and Arts Alliance, was also stuck on the car.

A News Corp spokesperson declined to comment on the author of the letter or the claims it makes about salary cuts.

The MEAA has been contacted for comment regarding details of the letter and posters but has not returned calls.

'An open letter to Rupert Murdoch on the eve of The 50th Anniversary of The Australian'

'As a passionate and committed journalist yourself, you know that the success of The Australian and other News Corp titles lies in the quality of the journalism.

So, we humbly ask you, as the people who do that journalism, to suggest to your managers here that they spare a thought for us, the very hardworking journalists, photographers, and artists at News Corp.

Your managers are insisting on imposing on us a pay cut in real terms, and that we give up various allowances and conditions.

Please ask your managers to ask themselves: Do we really deserve that?

Many thanks,

The Journalists, Artists and Photographers of News Corp.'
