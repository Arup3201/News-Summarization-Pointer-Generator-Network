The exchanges between Nathan Cleverly and Tony Bellew ahead of their fight at the Liverpool Echo Arena on Saturday have already become nasty. The pair do not get on.

When they fought as light heavyweights in 2011, Cleverly emerged victorious but Bellew has made it clear he is out for revenge now they have both moved up to cruiserweights and predicted he will enjoy a 'devastating' victory at the weekend.

They will face up again for the weigh-in at St George's Hall on Friday and you can watch the meeting live below.
