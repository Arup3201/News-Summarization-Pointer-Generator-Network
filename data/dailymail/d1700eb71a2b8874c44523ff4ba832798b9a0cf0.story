These eerie images show the interior of a former courthouse which has remained almost untouched since it was abandoned nearly two decades ago.

The Old Town Hall in Sheffield hosted the city's crown court for 100 years, but now the Grade II-listed building in danger of demolition.

Photographer Dan Circa captured the atmospheric pictures, which show how the benches and docks in each courtroom are still in place.

Abandoned: The Old Town Hall in Sheffield was formerly used as the city's crown court but is now entirely unused

Inside: A courtroom inside the building, where the benches and docks are still intact two decades later

Cells: The paint is peeling off the tiles on the walls and ceiling of the police cells located in the basement of the court

Overhead: The courtroom looks as if it has only just been vacated despite being unused since 1997

There are also objects formerly used by those who worked inside, such as telephones and legal documents - while the cells below the court can also be visited.

'It's such a rare sight to see and roam free in somewhere like this,' said Mr Circa, 28, from Manchester.

'The cells felt very oppressive, I sat in one with the door closed for a good ten minutes, just thinking if I had been locked away for real.

'The courtrooms had a smell of damp in the air and had a very theatrical atmosphere.

Left behind: A crumbling law book used by barristers and judges was found inside the building

Dusty: A landline phone remains in place inside the Old Town Hall, while crown insignia hints at its former use

Staircase: The Grade II-listed building is unoccupied and in danger of destruction despite campaigns to save it

Office: The door into the room provided for solicitors during the building's time as the crown court

'Although there wasn't a lot inside, there were some legal reference books and keys for the cell doors.

'I bet all the prisoners that had been locked away wished they could have got their hands on them at the time.'

He took the photographs after being allowed in by builders working on the site.

The Old Town Hall was built in 1808, and it was turned into the crown court after a replacement hall was built at the end of the century.

Haunting: Photographer Dan Circa described the cells as 'oppressive' and said they depicted the atmosphere of the time

Locked away: Those appearing in court would be kept in these cells in between their hearings

Untouched: The cells still have their original beds installed, although paint is flaking off nearly every surface in the building

Surveillance: The doors of the cells were fitted with peepholes to allow warders to see inside

It played host to a number of notable cases - including the murder trial of Ian Wood, who shot dead his pregnant mistress in 1986 before fleeing to France and trying to throw himself off a cathedral.

However, in 1997 the city opened a new court building, and the hall was sold off and left to crumble.

Local campaigners have long called for the hall to be filled once again so that Sheffield can make the best use of its historic heritage.

In 2007, the Victorian Society named it one of the most endangered 19th-century buildings in the UK.

Entrance: The Old Town Hall was built in 1808 and the interiors boast a neo-classical design with columns and pediments

Fears: Campaigners are concerned that the building has been allowed to follow into disrepair despite its historic and architectural importance

Fireplace: Some rooms show clear signs of their neglect and now look like a building site

Layout: This photograph shows the lawyers' benches as well as the jury box, located on the right of the image

'I want to bring this place to the attention of the masses in hope that they will make good use of the building,' Mr Circa said.

'Instead of staying empty this place could be used for TV shows, or made into a museum, restaurant or art gallery.

'It's such an important part of Sheffield's history that I feel it is just wasted sat there like this.

'These photographs of the courts and cells create a big reaction from the public, with most people say I'm lucky to have seen such a place without actually getting into trouble.'

Misbehaving? The location of this cigarette makes it look as if a barrister was smoking in the courtroom

Modern: Another courtroom looks as if it could still be in use today

Carving: The insignia of the crown is included in the wooden pediments over the building's doors

Case: The Daily Mail's report of Ian Wood's murder trial, which took place at Sheffield Crown Court in 1987
