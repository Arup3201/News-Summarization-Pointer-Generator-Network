North Korean leader Kim Jong-un has told his military chiefs to prepare for war against the South in 2015, it has been claimed.

According to South Korea's largest daily newspaper, a source has revealed that the dictator plans to invade and has ordered the army to remain 'combat-ready'.

The source told the Chosun Ilbo: 'Armed confrontation could take place on the Korean peninsula in 2015,' IBT reports.

They added: 'Since he came to power in late 2011, Kim Jong-un has often said his aim is reunification "through force" and that he would personally drive a tank and advance into Seoul.'

North Korea test-launched two Nodong medium-range ballistic missiles into the sea off Korean peninsula's east coast on Wednesday morning, according to South Korea's defence ministry

While the Chosun Ilbo paper is well respected and informed, South Korean reports are often over sensationalised.

It
 comes as South Koreans gathered in the capital of Seoul today to 
protest against the North firing nuclear missiles off the Korean coast.

Kim
 Jong-Un’s army test-launched two Nodong medium-range ballistic missiles
 into the sea off the peninsula's east coast, according to South Korea's
 defence ministry. 

The 
North Korean missiles were set off into the sea shortly after 5.30pm GMT
 on Tuesday, just as the leaders of its rivals Japan and South Korea sat
 down to a meeting with U.S. president Barack Obama.

The firing off the missiles also 
coincided  with the fourth anniversary of the sinking of the South 
Korean navy ship the Cheonan, for which Seoul blames North Korea.

The
 Cheonan was sunk in the Yellow Sea near the inter-Korean maritime 
border, leaving 46 people dead or missing and presumed dead.

A
 South Korean official said the missiles fell into the sea after flying 
400 miles, well short of their maximum range - thought to be some 1,300 
km (800 miles).

South 
Korean Defence Ministry spokesman Kim Min-seok called the launches ‘a 
clear violation of U.N. Security Council resolutions and a grave 
provocation against South Korea and the international community’.

Pro or no? It is unclear if the man who set fire to the North Korean flag was attacking the protesters or making his own anti-nuclear statement

In
 what appeared to be a show of defiance, North Korea fired the two 
medium-range Rodong ballistic missiles into the sea at 2:35 a.m. Japan 
and Korea time, 5.35pm GMT, both Tokyo and Seoul said.

That
 was precisely when Abe and South Korean President Park Geun-hye were 
sitting down with Obama in The Hague for their first meeting since Abe 
took office in December 2012.

Washington
 hopes the three-way summit will improve relations between Seoul and 
Tokyo, which are clouded by the legacy of Japan's 1910-1945 colonial 
rule of the Korean peninsula and Seoul's concerns that Prime Minister 
Shinzo Abe wants to rewrite Japan's wartime past with a less apologetic 
tone.

The United States 
wants to strengthen the allies' combined response to regional concerns 
such as North Korea's banned weapons programmes and China's growing 
assertiveness in disputed waters.

Park,
 Abe and Obama, who met on the sidelines of a nuclear security summit in
 the Hague, emphasised the need to work together on containing the North
 Korean nuclear threat.

‘Over
 the last five years, close coordination between our three countries 
succeeded in changing the game with North Korea: our trilateral 
cooperation has sent a strong signal to Pyongyang that its provocations 
and threats will be met with a unified response,’ said Obama, who will 
visit Japan and South Korea next month.

In
 an apparent attempt to break the ice with Park, Abe addressed the South
 Korean leader in Korean at the start of the talks, saying he was ‘very 
happy to be able to meet’ her.
