The CEO of Sweet Peach Probiotics is a woman, it has been revealed - and she is none too pleased with how her male colleagues have portrayed her product to the public.

Last week, entrepreneurs Austen Heinz and Gilad Gome sparked an outrage after announcing they were launching a supplement that uses DNA printing technology to alter your natural feminine scent - or, more precisely, to make your lady parts smell like peaches.

As it turns out, they had no right to speak on the subject, since the sole founder of the company is 20-year-old Audrey Hutchison, a former Bard science student and self-described 'ultra-feminist' who says her invention has been grossly misinterpreted.

Speaking out: Audrey Hutchison (pictured), the female CEO of Sweet Peach Probiotics, is none too pleased with how her male colleagues Austen Heinz and Gilad Gome portrayed her product to the public last week

While Mr Heinz and Mr Gome touted Sweet Peach as a way to 'empower' women by changing their natural scent, Miss Hutchison claims its principle aim is to promote optimal vaginal health.

'I'm obviously sort of appalled that it's been misconstrued like this because it was never the point of my company,' she told Inc.

'I don't want to apologize for [Austen], but at the same time I want to apologize to every woman in the world who's heard about this and wants my head on a stake.'

Miss Hutchison explained that she wasn't at the DEMO conference where Mr Heinz and Mr Gome made their controversial debut of Sweet Peach because the men, who both own their own biotech companies, were actually invited to present different products.

'I wasn't ready to publicize my company at all,' she said. 'So now I have a lot of questions being asked and a lot of really terrible things being said about my company.'

Mr Heinz, a biotech entrepreneur who owns just 10per cent of the Sweet Peach company, raised eyebrows when he said in his presentation last week: 'The idea is personal empowerment. All your smells are not human. They're produced by the creatures that live on you.'

And Mr Gome, who is reportedly not involved in Sweet Peach at all, added: 'We think it's a fundamental human right to not only know your code and the code of the things that live on you but also to rewrite that code and personalize it.'

Misconstrued: 'I wasn't ready to publicize my company at all,' she said. 'So now I have a lot of questions being asked and a lot of really terrible things being said about my company'

While the men did touch on the fact that the pill helps prevent yeast infections and other health problems, they did not give the impression that this was its main purpose.

The peach scent, Mr Gome said, is an indicator that the product is working. 'What, would you rather have it glow?' he added.

Falsely believing that they were the sole founders of Sweet Peach, many questioned why the pair chose to focus on that particular body part - to which they responded that their invention could 'connect you to yourself in a better way'. 

Mr Gome explained that the female genitalia is the ideal body part for this type of DNA printing. 'It's a better idea than trying to hack the gut microbiome because it's less complicated and more stable,' he explained.

Plus, he added: 'It only has one interference per month.' 

In reality, Sweet Peach has nothing to do with scent, says Miss Hutchison. She told the Huffington Post that her company, which is still in the development stages, will provide women with kits to swab their vaginas at home and mail the swab into a lab.

Scientists can then sequence the genomes of their vaginal bacteria in order to create a personalized probiotic that can fight UTIs and yeast infections. 

'It's nothing about scent,' she insisted. 'A vagina should smell like a vagina, and anyone who doesn't think that doesn't deserve to be near one.'

Mr Gome and Mr Heinz's presentation upset Miss Hutchison to such an extent that she has since changed her Twitter bio to read: 'CEO of Sweet Peach Probiotics and definitely not interested in making your vagina smell like a peach'.

'All I want to do is provide women with agency in their own reproductive health,' she tweeted on Thursday, adding that due to reading the negative press instigated by Mr Gome and Mr Heinz, 'I'm on the verge of projectile vomiting everywhere.'
