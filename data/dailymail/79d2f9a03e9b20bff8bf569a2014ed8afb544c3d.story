is the only one to go on national television spewing sexist,

Further vicious allegations in the public Christie Brinkley-Peter Cook divorce saga have emerged, with Cook accusing the supermodel of 'throwing her family under a bus' to raise her profile.

In a TV interview he hit out at the former Sports Illustrated model, saying that by broadcasting her ongoing child custody battles in the media, she is harming their children.

Cook told ABC News he believed she was throwing her family 'under the bus' to drum up publicity for her return to Broadway.

'She can use her celebrity to get the 
media to say 'He's a bad guy.' You know … I'm not trying to sell tickets
to anything. I don't want this press. I'm not interested in it. And 
there's got to be a better way for her to do it. Go do a charitable act 
or something, get your name in the paper. But stop throwing your family 
under the bus,' the 53-year-old Hamptons architect told said in an 
interview.

Cook accused Brinkley of making their latest court battle public 'to coincide with her return to the stage in Chicago.

'I don't know how you can ever 
rationalize your way out of fighting to have this private family matter 
become so public. And children will live with it forever,' he said. 'I 
mean, it used to be 40 years ago, it was in the newspaper and it ended 
up under a bird somewhere. But now it's Google eternity. This will never
go away for my children,' he  said.

In response to the comments Cook made 
during the interview,  Brinkley's attorney, Tom Campagna, released the 
following statement:

'Peter Cook has repeatedly broken the 
confidentiality agreement that Christie has continued to uphold. Peter 
is the only one to go on national television spewing sexist, 
disgraceful, demonstrably false lies, which gives a taste of what 
Christie has had to endure since Peter betrayed his marriage vows. Peter
embarrassed himself and hurt his family by having an affair with a 
teenage girl and admitting to an extensive pornography habit.'

The supermodel recently claimed that she is being bullied by him in a string of nasty emails.

Last weekend it was revealed that Ms 
Brinkley, 58, wants Mr Cook to cough up $140,000 in fines over the 
emails, in addition to $32,000 in expenses for their two children, 
including school tuition and summer camp fees.

A source told the New York Daily News:
'Peter keeps trying to control Christie, and he can’t deal with the 
fact that he can’t control her'.

Mr Campagna told
the paper that a judge smacked Mr Cook with an order after their 
divorce that he be fined $5,000 for each time he got out of hand with Ms
Brinkley.

She claims he has violated that order 28 times, but is not out for financial gain.

Mr Campagna told the Daily News: 'This is not about the money. This is about what we're calling bullying'.

Last week, Mr Cook lashed out at the supermodel in an explosive court document countering claims he owes her child support.

Mr Cook, 53, reignited their bitter 
custody dispute, claiming in a 91-page document at Suffolk County 
Supreme Court in New York that she owes him money - calling her a 
'narcissistic egomaniac'.

The architect claims he is owed 
$25,000 from Ms Brinkley for caring for their children while she 
performed in Chicago on New York’s Broadway and London's West End, the 
New York Post reported.

He also claims Ms Brinkley is dragging
their two children into their disputes, claiming she has called him 
'truly narcissistic', and once wrote an email to their son that Mr Cook 
'is jealous of my success'.

Ms Brinkley met Mr Cook in 1998 and had her third child, Sailor, with him.

Mr Cook legally adopted her son with ex-husband Richard Taubman, Jack.

She also has a daughter, Alexa Ray, with second husband, musician Billy Joel.

Ms Brinkley appeared in several of his music videos, including the 1983 hit Uptown Girl. They were married for nine years.

But Ms Brinkley, who has been married four times, has been trading jabs with Mr Cook since their acrimonious split in 2008.

Bitter divorce proceedings revealed Mr Cook spent thousands of dollars a month accessing internet porn.

He was also romantically involved with a neighbour’s daughter, Diana Bianchi, who was 18 at the time.

During their 2008 divorce, the court was told that he had paid Ms Bianchi $300,000 in the hope of her keeping the liaison quiet.

Ms Brinkley meanwhile charged that Mr 
Cook was a bad father who used 'overwhelming' physical force when 
disciplining the children.

The court psychiatrist said both parties needed therapy.

Blue-eyed and blonde-haired Ms 
Brinkley was born in Monroe, Michigan, but grew up in Malibu, 
California, before moving to Paris, France, for art school at age 18.

She then spent three years as an 
illustrator before being noticed by an American photographer - and then 
proceeded to appear on 200 magazine covers in the 1980s.

Ms Brinkley is most famous for 
appearing on three consecutive Sports Illustrated swimsuit edition 
covers from 1979 to 1981, and for her appearances in perfume and shampoo
adverts.
