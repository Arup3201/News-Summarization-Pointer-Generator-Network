Rupert Murdoch's daughter Elisabeth told Rebekah Brooks to quit as boss of News International because of the phone hacking scandal.

Ms Murdoch also suggested her brother James stepped down as chairman because harmful publicity was badly damaging her father's business, she revealed last night.

Infamously it was claimed she had ‘railed’ against Ms 
Brooks and told her she had ‘f****d the company’, but the media mogul's daughter denied this happened when she spoke at the Edinburgh International Television Festival.

But both did eventually resign in 2011, after the closure of the News of the World.

Asked if it was true that she had 
advised James to step back and Ms Brooks to resign during a question and answer session, she said: 'Yes, it 
is, but... it was said within closed walls and Rebekah did resign.'

Ms
Murdoch, who is the third member of her family to give the landmark 
address to the TV industry, said one reason for giving it was to make 
sure 'not everybody is tarred or marked with the same brush'.

Asked if she had ever said James or Ms Brooks had f***** the company, she said: 'No, for the record, absolutely not.'

Ms Murdoch said it had been 'a nightmare year for the family' but she was aware it had 'not been as difficult for us as for the people who have been victims or Milly Dowler’s parents'.

Tensions: Elisabeth Murdoch appeared to criticise her brother James's attitude to business last night

She said she was 'pleased' her father had told a parliamentary select committee that giving evidence was 'the most humble day' of his life.

She said: 'I know he absolutely meant it and it was, if I’m honest as a daughter, heart-breaking.'

The bitter tensions within the Murdoch clan were when Elisabeth Murdoch warned that ‘profit without purpose is a recipe for disaster’.

She was responding to a speech her brother gave three years ago, delivering the same lecture, where he had claimed the free market alone would guarantee innovation and independence as he also hit out at the ‘chilling’ scale of the BBC.

But in what many will see as a further dig at her brother, she said ‘global society’ needed to ‘reject the idea that money is the only effective measure of all things or that the free market is the only sorting mechanism’.

She was even in danger of siding with traditional Murdoch enemies such as the BBC and left-wing playwrights, in what many will see as her attempt to distance herself from their perceived failings.

Industry figures believe she wishes to become the anointed heir to her father’s empire.

Miss Murdoch also admitted her father’s company News Corp, which owned the News of the World and also owns her production company, was ‘currently asking itself some very significant and difficult questions about how some behaviours fell so far short of its values.’

The 44-year-old also warned of the threat to press freedom from ‘enemies within’ - a remark that will be widely seen as a criticism of News International employees caught up in the phone hacking scandal that has rocked the business.

In what appeared to be a further acknowledgement of how the allegations of phone hacking have devastated the family firm, she added that ‘personally’ she thought one of the biggest lessons had been the need for organisations to ‘discuss, affirm and institutionalise a rigorous set of values’ based on an explicit ‘statement of purpose’.

In a stark contrast to her brother’s 2009 speech she heaped praise on the BBC saying she was a ‘current supporter of the universal licence fee’ and praised the ‘vision and leadership’ of Mark Thompson, the outgoing director general.

In what many in the industry regard as a subtle attack on her father, she also quoted with approval another former MacTaggart speaker, Dennis Potter who said television should ‘make hearts pound’.

The playwright famously used his lecture to demand her father be put on trial and even named his cancer Rupert after him.

She also quoted the playwright Alan Bennett and described him as ‘wonderful’, despite his lengthy and public feud with her father.

Bennett famously branded him a “bully that should be stood up to publicly” and refused an honorary degree from Oxford University because the magnate has funded a position there. It was unclear if the Shine Group boss had told her father and brother what was in the speech before she delivered it.

Miss Murdoch spoke about her brother James Murdoch’s speech, giving the same lecture three years ago, in which he attacked the ‘land-grab’ of the BBC and said that the only real guarantee of independence was profit and commercial competition.

But Miss Murdoch said of the licence fee: ‘A few have even questioned the legitimacy of the mandatory levy. However, despite a valuable contribution to this debate – James ended his lecture with a line in which he claimed that the only reliable and perpetual guarantor of independence is profit.

‘He clearly intended the statement to be provocative, and it is, but I also think that it deserves further analysis,

‘James was right that if you remove profit, then independence is massively challenged but I think that he left something out: the reason his statement sat so uncomfortably is that profit without purpose is a recipe for disaster.’

She added: ‘Do we have such faith in the imperatives of the market that we need have no will of our own other than to succeed on its terms. It’s us, human beings, we the people, who create the society we want, not profit.’

‘It is increasingly apparent that the absence of purpose  - or of a moral language – within government, media or business, could become one of the most dangerous own goals for capitalism and for freedom.’

She also criticised the ‘sometimes self-serving relationships’ between police, politics, media or banking.

But she said despite such an ‘unsettling dearth of integrity’ across so many institutions, which has been explored by the Leveson enquiry, ‘the right outcome’ must be ‘the fierce protection of a free press and light touch media regulation’.

She added, in what many will interpret as a criticism of senior executives at News International, that: ‘Sadly the greatest threats to our free society are too often from enemies within.’

The TV boss admitted News Corp, which owned the News of the World and also owns her production company, was ‘currently asking itself some very significant and difficult questions about how some behaviours fell so far short of its values.’

Miss Murdoch added independence from regulation is only ‘democratically viable’ when ‘we accept that we have a responsibility to each other and not just to our bottom line’. She said profit should be the ‘servant’ not the ‘master’.

Miss Murdoch, who reportedly claimed News International chief Rebekah Brooks had 'f****d the company', also warned of the threat to press freedom from 'enemies within'

She said that ‘personally’ she thought one of the biggest lessons had been the need for organisations to ‘discuss, affirm and institutionalise a rigorous set of values’ based on an explicit ‘statement of purpose’.

Miss Murdoch became the third member of her family - following father Rupert and brother James - to make the celebrated MacTaggart lecture at the Edinburgh International Television Festival.

She founded production company Shine which is responsible for shows including MasterChef and Merlin.

In the speech she said: ‘Let’s see what the Leveson enquiry recommends but when there has been such an unsettling dearth of integrity across so many of our institutions, it is very difficult to argue for the right outcome - which must be the fierce protection of a free press and light touch media regulation. Sadly the greatest threats to our free society are too often from enemies within.’

The speech ended with a hymn of praise to her father telling how he ‘had the vision, the will and the sense of purpose to challenge the old world order on behalf of ‘the people’.

Her often deeply personal remarks included a reference to the family’s position as ‘permanent outsiders and constant nomads but in ‘pursuit of a greater good - a belief in better.’
