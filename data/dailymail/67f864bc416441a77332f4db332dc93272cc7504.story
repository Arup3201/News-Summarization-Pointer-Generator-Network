Police are to investigate Nigella Lawson over her admission that she took cocaine and smoked cannabis in front of her children.

In an extraordinary turnaround, the celebrity cook could now face the prospect of being formally interviewed by officers over her evidence.

Last week, when her former assistants Francesca and Elisabetta Grillo were acquitted of defrauding her and ex-husband Charles Saatchi, Scotland Yard appeared reluctant to act.

Facing probe: Nigella Lawson arriving at Isleworth Crown Court in London where she gave evidence in the trial of two former personal assistants who worked for her and Charles Saatchi

In a statement, it said: 'At this stage the Metropolitan Police will not be investigating these allegations.'

But in the wake of stinging criticism, a senior commander at the Metropolitan Police gave an interview in which he suggested police would pursue the matter with fresh vigour.

Commander Stephen Watson said officers would be working with prosecutors to examine the 'implications' of what Miss Lawson and her aides said under oath. He promised the Yard would devote 'specialist resources' to examine all the evidence in what could be a protracted review.

Dismissing the earlier statement, he said: 'Frankly, I don't think the full colour of the  Metropolitan Police Service's position was conveyed in that statement. We will use specialist resources from within the Metropolitan Police Service to examine all the evidence which emerged as part of a review into this matter.

'At some point, once that review is concluded, presumably in conjunction with the Crown Prosecution Service, we will determine a way forward.

'Part and parcel of that review we will undertake will be to look at all aspects of the testimony that was given in the trial, which is now public knowledge, and will reveal itself in the transcripts of the trial.

'There are implications in terms of what has been said during the course of that trial and all those implications will be taken into account in determining an appropriate way forward.'

The significant development comes as a damning statement emerged yesterday from Kay Saatchi, Charles's second wife, suggesting that Miss Lawson tried to involve his 18-year-old daughter Phoebe in drug taking.

Mrs Saatchi said: 'I am furious that my daughter, Phoebe, was put into a dangerous environment with the heavy drug use of Nigella.'

The revelations could prompt social services to intervene amid claims that Miss Lawson habitually used drugs in front of her own children aged 17 and 19 and may have involved them and step-daughter Phoebe in 'a druggy world'.

Social services may want to consider whether the allegations raise child protection issues.

When she took the stand at Isleworth Crown Court to give evidence against her two former aides, the TV cook admitted taking cocaine on six occasions with John Diamond, her first husband, when he found out he had terminal cancer.

She also said she took the class-A drug in July 2010 when she was subjected to 'intimate terrorism' by Mr Saatchi. Miss Lawson admitted smoking cannabis in the last year of her marriage to the multi-millionaire art gallery owner.

However her two assistants told the court she repeatedly used the class-A drug and Elisabetta Grillo said the chef 'lets the children smoke weed'.

Police will now consider whether to bring drug possession charges and could interview her under caution in a bid to identify her suppliers.

They may also want to question Victoria Coren, who wrote in a national newspaper that she had taken cocaine with Mr Diamond before his death in 2001. Yesterday a spokesman stressed there was no 'imminent prospect of a prosecution', but a full review of the case will take place.

Like his predecessors, Yard boss Sir Bernard Hogan-Howe will be particularly sensitive to any notion that police give celebrities special treatment.

But without physical evidence of possession of the class-A drug, it may be difficult to bring any charges.

Former Met commissioner Sir Ian Blair famously vowed to crack down on middle-class cocaine users.

But the following year, a cocaine probe into Kate Moss ended in farce. The supermodel was cleared despite being pictured apparently snorting 'line after line' at a recording studio. A minor legal loophole meant police could not prove which type of drug was involved.

A spokesman for Westminster City Council refused to comment on the Miss Lawson case yesterday. She said: 'We do not comment on the specifics of protecting children.'
