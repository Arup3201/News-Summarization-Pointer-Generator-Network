It was supposed to be a day about celebrating the Jersey Shore coming back together after the devastating impact of Superstorm Sandy.

However, while the buildings and boardwalk of Seaside Heights can be repaired, it seems the relationship between New Jersey's governor and the area's most famous celebrities - the cast of MTV's The Jersey Shore - cannot.

The smallest member of the reality cast Nicole 'Snooki' Polizzi went head to head with Governor Chris Christie on Friday at the reopening of the Seaside Heights' boardwalk, which featured heavily in the reality series.

Stand off: Nicole tweeted that the politician told her the cast were bad for New Jersey's reputation

The pair had just filmed separate 
segments on the Today show when backstage the 25-year-old stopped the 
Governor to address why he has been critical about the show's influence 
on the area in the past.

The incident was caught on tape by Asbury Park Press and it was clear things were frosty between the pair.

While not heard on the video, according to Snooki the politician had made his feelings clear.

'Getting told why we are bad for jersey. Amazing,' the star tweeted.

In the video, Nicole can be heard asking the much larger man to step back from her as they talk.

'Why are you standing so close to me,' the mother of one asks.

Leaning comically even closer to Nicole, Christie says: 'You asked for my opinion.'

Trying to subdue the situation cast mate Deena Cortese, flanked by Jennifer 'JWoww' Farley, tells the politician she is from Jersey.

'I know you are, I was talking about her,' the governor curtly replies.

Still trying to calm things down Denna said: 'And guess what? I thought you did a good job with the hurricane.'

With the situation not getting any better, Snooki explains: 'I just wanted to meet you, and just, hope you start to like us.'

His response isn't audible, but as he shakes the girls' hands as he 
walks away it is clear neither party is a big fan of the other.

'He doesn't just like us,' Nicole then tells the cameraman.

Earlier the New Jersey Governor had appeared on Today to celebrate the reopening of the boardwalk after the devastation of Hurricane
 Sandy in October 2012.

He told Today's Matt Lauer that 'things are going well' and he is 'feeling great' 
after undergoing lap-band surgery on February 16.

Looking noticeably less large than he used to, the Governor has already shed an estimated 40lbs 
since the procedure. 

He told Lauer that he realizes his weight will
 be a 'life-long struggle ... I don't plan on taking any victory laps.'

Lauer probed about the publicity over
 Christie's surgery and the Governor said he has been surprised by how 
much attention it has received.

'It's much more than I imagined,' he said of the curiosity about his weight.

Back in business: The Republican politician welcomed the Today show to the Boardwalk in Seaside Heights to celebrate the progress after Hurricane Sandy

'I mis-evaluated that part of it but in the end, it’s really nice,' the questions are 'borne out of concern for me and 
that's great,' he added.

Initially the morning show had 
publicized that Christie would serve as a guest co-host for the program 
but he had to surrender the morning show title due to FCC rules.

Since Christie is running for a second term as New Jersey Governor,
 his opponent in the Republican primary, New Jersey lawyer Seth 
Grossman, could have asserted his right for equal on-air time, an FCC 
spokesman told PolitickerNJ.

The FCC rules require broadcasters to provide equal airtime for legally qualified candidates.

The
 cast joined Governor Christie and a host of volunteers to carry out a 
5.5 mile long ceremonial ribbon that broke the Guinness World record for
 longest ribbon cutting.

Instead of being a co-host, Christie simply had an 'extended interview' that focused on the state's recovery after Sandy.

Despite the focus on the reconstruction after the storm, Lauer did inquire after the buzz over Christie's trimmer figure.

His
 decision to manage his weight was seen as a clear signal that the 
popular Republican had his eye on the national stage, likely a 
presidential bid, but Christie downplayed any political motivation.

'That's
 not why I'm doing this,' he said, insisting his family - wife Mary Pat,
 whom he married in 1986, and their four children - was the main 
inspiration.

'I hope 
there’s a Christie effect for Christie, and if there’s other stuff that 
happens for folks, that’s great. But that’s not why I’m doing it. I’m 
doing it for (wife) Mary Pat, for my kids, and for myself, to be better 
and to be healthier.'

Gov. 
Christie was upbeat about the resilience of Jersey residents after the 
storm. He will welcome President Obama to the Garden State next Tuesday 
to tour the progress.

Happy day: Clearly emotional for the reality stars, all were seen hugging and kissing

He
 has been criticized by some GOPers who say he has developed a 'special 
relationship' with the Democrat and his chummy rapport after Hurricane 
Sandy gave a boost to Obama during the presidential election.

But the outspoken New Jerseyan said in times of emergency, the nation needs to come together regardless of political parties.

'If
 the President of the United States wants to come and see the people of 
New Jersey, I'm the Governor and I'll be here to welcome him here.'

Despite the incident with Gov. 
Christie, the cast spent the rest of the day with big smiles on their 
faces, as while they long ago said goodbye to MTV's Jersey Shore, this 
was another chance to see the town that had put them on the map.

Clearly emotional for the reality stars, all were seen hugging and kissing as they joined the happy celebrations.

Almost all of the final season's cast
 - Deena, Vinny Guadagnino, Sam Giancola, Paul 'Pauly D' Del Vecchio, 
Snooki, Ronnie Ortiz-Magro, and JWoww - helped set a ribbon cutting 
record.

Mike 'The Situation' Sorrentino was not with his cast mates on Friday.

The hit show had previously been 
credited with helping tourism grow at the seaside city. AP reported that
 Pauly D said he and his cast mates wanted the Shore to be the happy 
place they remember.

'This is known as a happy place. 
Right after the storm, it was the exact opposite: dead, silent,' he 
said. 'To see this place being rebuilt makes me happy.'

Snooki called on tourists to come back and enjoy the area. 'You just come here to have a good time,' she said.

'It's a great place. You come here with your friends. Everybody's here, it's getting rebuilt - it's just amazing.'

Tourism
 is a near $40 billion industry in New Jersey and the storm not only 
damaged the physical area but dealt a significant blow to the local 
economy.

The storm caused $38 billion in 
damages in New Jersey alone and at Seaside Heights the storm swept a 
roller coaster into the ocean.

While
 the roller coaster was taken away this month, but Casino Pier, the 
seaside amusement park where it used to sit, plans to have 18 rides open
 this summer.
