'Lifeline': Kate McCann outside Downing Street yesterday

Kate McCann has hailed the launch of a European hotline for reporting missing and abducted children as a 'lifeline' for families like hers.

Speaking at Downing Street yesterday, she said that cases such as the disappearance of her daughter Madeleine had led to 'greater awareness' of the problem and said there had been a shift in attitudes among politicians.

'We just need to keep spreading the message. Its a big problem, and we do need the Government's backing,' said Mrs McCann at the launch of the hotline at Number 10.

'In the last few years there's been greater awareness and certainly there's been a greater political will,' she said.

It is hoped the free and confidential 116000 hotline, which is available in 16 European countries including France, Spain and Portugal, will help police forces to act quickly when children disappear.

A child is reported missing in the UK every three minutes.

Madeleine McCann went missing in the Portuguese resort of Praia da Luz on May 3 2007, just days before her fourth birthday.

British detectives said last month that there was a chance she could still be alive, more than five years after she disappeared in the holiday spot in the Algarve.

Reviewing the case, they said they were pursuing 195 leads and firmly believed Madeleine was abducted.

Portuguese police, however, have refused to re-open the case.

A Swiss father was questioned by police earlier this month after it emerged he was seen with a blonde girl in his car just hours after Madeleine disappeared, but insisted he was driving his own daughter.

The hotline is run by missingkids.co.uk, Britain's official website to help find missing children, which was also relaunched ahead of International Missing Children's Day on Friday.

Home Secretary Theresa May hosted the reception in Number 10 for campaign groups, celebrity supporters and families of missing children.

Also attending was Nicki Durbin, whose 19-year-old son Luke went missing after a night out with friends in Ipswich, Suffolk, in May 2006.

She said: 'There's been a huge change in the last year, and more people are aware about all of our missing ones.'

Two London cabs sporting advertisements for the newly-relaunched website were parked outside the front door of Number 10.

Martin Houghton-Brown, chief executive of Missing People, added: 'Disappearances such as Madeleine McCann's tragically demonstrated the need for co-ordination across the world when a child goes missing.

'116000 is introduced so that people can call when someone disappears regardless of which EU country they are in.'

Equalities Minister Lynne Featherstone said vulnerable missing children need the best support possible.

'Government has set a clear direction for this with our missing children and adults strategy, calling on local and national organisations to prevent, protect and provide support for missing children and their families,' she said.
