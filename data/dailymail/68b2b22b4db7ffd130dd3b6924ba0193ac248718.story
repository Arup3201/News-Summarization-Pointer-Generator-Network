A lawyer’s clerk who sent text messages to a prisoner just days before a mobile phone was used to stage his escape from a prison van has been jailed for six months.

Sarah McCabe, 33, sent three illicit texts in the space of 13 minutes to convicted robber Ryan MacDonald after the phone was illegally smuggled into Altcourse prison near Liverpool where he was being held.

Just three weeks later MacDonald, 20, and a fellow inmate were broken out of a prison van while on their way to court during rush hour in Manchester.

Illicit messages: Sarah McCabe, 33, sent text messages to convicted robber Ryan MacDonald in his cell just three weeks before he escaped from a prison van on the way to court

A gang of masked men, believed to be using GPS technology to track the vehicle, blocked the vehicle with a car in the middle of the street and threatened a guard with a sawn-off shotgun before smashing the windows.

The two inmates then leapt from the truck and all five jumped back into the Saab, which was dumped further down the street.

Three of the gang ran into a nearby council estate whilst the other two sped off on a motorbike. Both escaped inmates were recaptured a few days later.

Secret communication: MacDonald, right, asked the lawyer's clerk what sentences he was likely to receive if he robbed a pawn brokers

McCabe of Swinton, Salford, who was acting for MacDonald in his court case, was arrested after a SIM card was recovered from his cell at the privately run jail.

Police investigating the breakout later examined the SIM and found three text messages from McCabe on it in which she and her client discussed the possible sentence he might face for robbing pawnbrokers shops.

In one message MacDonald texted McCabe saying: 'Bail me?' but she did not reply.

He then texted her saying: 'Get us a three. I will take that ha ha x' to which she later responded: 'Oh yeah, that’s gonna happen x.'

McDonald texted back saying: 'Is it a five then?' and McCabe who works at David O’Reilly Solicitors in Salford replied: 'I’m not even thinking a five! I’ll have to get Rob to work his magic! X.”

McDonald then went on: 'Has Rob got magic in him? Har Har x.” McCabe texted back saying: 'I’d rather not know x.'

Escape: MacDonald and another inmate leapt from the truck and jumped jumped into a following car which was dumped further down the street

McCabe, who admitted assisting an offender, remained emotionless as she was sentenced at Manchester Crown Court.

Judge Michael Leeming said: 'Sarah McCabe you are an intelligent woman with previous good character.

The matter is before me because the person with whom you were in communication escaped from a prison van while on route to this court to be sentenced for serious drugs offences.

'The other man was being tried for very serious offences and that trial had to be stopped because of the publicity surrounding his escape.

'There is no suggestion that you played any part in the planning of the escape but it includes you because it involved the use of an illegally held mobile telephone used from custody.

Police operation: Both escaped inmates were recaptured a few days later

'This was a lack of judgement. The three texts are unrelated in nature to the circumstances of the escape. This was a foolish lack of judgement on your part and totally out of character. When considering the seriousness of your offending I have regard to your culpability and the harm your offending has caused.

'You of all people must have appreciated the peril of your behaviour. You did encourage him to continue to use the SIM by your actions.

'In your position you knew it was an offence for McDonald to be in possession of the phone. You encouraged him and failed to bring the mobile to the attention of the authorities. You put your firm’s interests with this client above the law and kept contact with him to keep him sweet.

'This offence is so serious that only an immediate custody sentence can be justified.'

Hidden: The judge said there was no evidence McCabe was involved in planning the escape, but was included because the phone was illegally in custody

The escape occurred on April 30 after MacDonald instructed McCabe’s law firm to represent him after he was charged over raids on pawnbrokers in Manchester and Salford where jewellery was stolen in daylight smash-and-grab raids.

McCabe sent her text messages on April 4 after he was remanded in custody to await sentence for conspiracy to rob and aggravated vehicle taking.

Elisa Hopley, prosecuting, said: 'A significant amount of planning into that escape was conducted by mobile phones held illegally. A phone used by MacDonald was active between March 8 and April 24.

'The SIM card was recovered from his cell but the handset was not recovered. The handset was the one used in the escape and that has not been found.

'McCabe’s personal telephone number came to the attention of the police. It became clear that she had contact with MacDonald when he was in prison. Her mobile phone was then seized.

'McCabe has admitted the offence and 
contact with MacDonald in interviews and admitted it was her personal 
phone and she used it for personal and work reasons.

'She
was under no illusions that she was in contact with a phone that was 
held illegally. They talked about a potential sentence for MacDonald.

'McCabe did nothing to alert authorities and kept up the contact rather than bringing phone to the attention of authorities.

'Had
the prison authorities been notified about the phone then their actions
may have been different and that may well have affected the escape of 
the prisoners. Her failure to notify authorities may have aided the 
escape.

Technology: The gang who assisted in the escape are believed to have used GPS to track the van

'McCabe should have been aware of the serious nature of this. She was an experienced legal representative. She can’t have failed to have been aware of he serious impact of phones in prison.'

Mitigating, Robert Kearney for McCabe, said: 'She immediately accepted it and recognised the foolishness of it in her interview.

'There couldn’t have been an earlier acceptance of wrongdoing on her part. The reality in this case is three texts of an unrelated nature to the escape.

'The defendant had nothing to do with the escape that involved McDonald and others. It was three texts made over 13 minutes on April 4. They were all work-related but all entirely foolish. Her own phone had been used at the this but that was only because her work phone was not fit for purpose.

'The authorities knew about McDonald’s access to telephones seven days prior to his escape. They knew the position of McDonald because they seized a SIM from him in prison prior to his escape.

'This amounts to a foolish lapse in judgement in a career that has lasted ten years. It is something she deeply regrets. She was of impeccable character. Her health has since suffered.

'She is currently prescribed medication for anxiety and depression and has been referred to counselling. She generally used to have a very sunny disposition.'

MacDonald was jailed for seven years and ten months over the jewellery raids. He and his fellow inmate Steve McMullen, 31 are due to face court later over the escape.

After the case Det Chief Insp Phil Reade of Greater Manchester Police said: “Sarah McCabe is a qualified and experienced legal representative who is fully aware of the law in relation to the contacting of clients on contraband phones.

'It goes without saying she is also fully aware of the consequences and it is therefore surprising that she would take such risks.'
