It has been five years since two Virginia Tech students were shot to death in the parking lot of a Virginia campground.

But local detectives are no closer to finding out who was behind the Aug. 26, 2009, slaying of Heidi Childs and David Metzler at Caldwell Fields in the George Washington and Jefferson National Forests.

Capt. Robert New on Tuesday said the Montgomery County Sheriff's Office still has no new information regarding the double shooting, the Richmond Times-Dispatch reported.

Childs, 18, and Metzler, 19, had been together for at least four years and had just started their second year at Virginia Tech, where she was majoring in industrial and systems engineering while he studied biochemistry.

The night they were killed, the couple, both of Virginia, had planned on chatting and playing guitars while parked at the idyllic campground in Montgomery County.Â 

Childs told friends they wouldn't be late because she had homework to do. They left her apartment about 8 pm.

Next morning, a man walking his dog found their bodies shot by a .30-30 rifle. He was inside his Toyota Camry. She was on the ground outside.

Since then, investigators have remained unable to point to a motive, saying the shootings were likely random, according to the Times-Dispatch.

On the third anniversary of the homicide in 2012, Sheriff Tommy Whitt revealed that his detectives had found DNA evidence at the scene and were trying to match it to people who frequent the area. He said his department was still actively working the case.

Childs and Metzler had been a couple for four years and wanted to attend Virginia Tech together. They were starting their second year there when they were killed

Every year since their killing, friends and family members have continued to drop by to set memorials at the spot where Childs and Metzler died

Back then, Whitt told WSET that he'd called the original lead investigator in the case out of retirement so he would focus finding the killer.

Detectives said the shooter took Childs' purse containing her cell phone, camera, Virginia Tech lanyard, ID and credit card. The items are still missing.

A $70,000 reward remains in place for any information related to the shootings.
