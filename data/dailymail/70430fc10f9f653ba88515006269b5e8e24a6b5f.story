A millionaire lottery winner was today jailed for trying to strangle his girlfriend with a seatbelt of a luxury car bought with his winnings.

Former professional cagefighter Gavin Davies, 29, attacked Daniah Hussain, 22, just three months after picking up a £1m jackpot.

Motoring fan Davies bought three luxury cars since his win - including a Lamborghini LP560-4.

Davies and Miss Hussein were travelling in his ‘everyday’ Audi when the pair started arguing - and he hit her dozens of times.

A court heard it ended with Daniah telling police that he wrapped the seatbelt around her neck in a violent attack.

Prosecutor Catherine Richards said: ‘It was a prolonged assault involving spitting and he hit her more than 50 times.

Davies, pictured celebrating his £1million win, will be sentenced next month for the attack on his ex girlfriend

‘The victim suffered swelling and bruising above the eye and around the neck.

‘She contacted police to say she had to have her nose realigned.’

Davies
was arrested after an alleged assault on the side of a busy motorway in
Neath, South Wales, with Miss Hussain - the mother of his five-month 
old son.

He admitted common 
assault during the attack in December, last year - a month before his 
win - and another charge of actual bodily harm in April.

The
court heard allegations were made that he ‘punched Miss Hussain in the 
face and he tried to strangle her with the seat belt’.

Miss Hussain has left the couple’s new home and is living at a secret address in the area.

Swansea Crown Court heard Davies had previous convictions for motoring offences.

Davies was revealed as the £1 million National Lottery raffle winner at a press conference in a plush Swansea hotel in January.

He was pictured alongside a Lamborghini provide for the day by lottery operator Camelot.

But he was soon seen purring around his hometown in his own Lamborghini and his new Audi.

At
the time of the win in January, Davies said: ‘I want to look after my 
son and look after my family. I’m going to use the money wisely and 
invest.

Gavin Davies bought a fleet of luxury cars with his £1million Lottery win, including a Lamborghini

‘I won’t waste a penny. Time will tell, but hopefully, you will see me one day with £10 million.

‘The Lamborghini is my fun out of the way. The rest of the money is to look after my family.’

Davies, of Ammanford, near Swansea, was remanded in custody to be sentenced next month.

Speaking after the case, a family spokesman said: ‘This has been a terrible ordeal for all of us.’
