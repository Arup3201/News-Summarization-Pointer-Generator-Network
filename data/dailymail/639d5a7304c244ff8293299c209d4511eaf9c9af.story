The distressing disappearance of AirAsia Indonesia flight QZ8501, en route from Indonesia to Singapore on Sunday, is the latest installment in Indonesia's checkered airline history which has recorded the deaths of almost 650 people in two decades.

The nation has struggled with its air safety record over the past two decades as the airline market in Southeast Asia has faced unparalleled demand for low-cost flights from a rapidly expanding population. 

While Indonesia has benefited economically from the growing market, it is struggling to meet safety standards, unable provide enough qualified pilots, mechanics, air traffic controllers and updated airport technology to ensure safety.

Despite 30% of plane crashes around the world occuring as a result of weather conditions, ground-based wind-shear detection systems introduced to notify plane crews to issues are absent in many airports around Indonesia. 

The nation of over 250 million people is set in a region which 'needs to look at improving air infrastructure and pursue an open skies policy,' Mr Niemeijer told Quartz.     

The Centre for Asia-Pacific Aviation recorded a 20% increase in seat volume between 2012 and 2013, totalling 5.6 million passengers on flights in the region.

The figures are expected to increase, with 70% of the world's busiest routes travelling through Southeast Asia, and 30% of the world's aircraft passengers expected to travel to the region in 2014, reported Orient Aviation Journal.

Willem Niemeijer, co-founder of Khiri Travel Group, said that 'increasing air traffic means crashes will increase as well.'
