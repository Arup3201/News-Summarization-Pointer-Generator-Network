Accused: Surgeon Ian Paterson is suspected of botching 1,000 breast cancer operations

Patients have unleashed their fury at a surgeon suspected of botching 1,000 breast cancer operations.

One woman, who was among scores allegedly given a needless mastectomy by Ian Paterson, said: ‘Put him in a room with all 1,000 of us and let us hack away at his body.’

Others said Mr Paterson, 54, had robbed them of their femininity.

The surgeon has been suspended from his job and is being investigated by police over allegations that he convinced 450 healthy women to have operations they did not need.

He is also accused of performing partial mastectomies on a further 700 patients – which may have increased the likelihood of them developing cancer.

Some of the women said they felt mentally tortured by being made to think for years that they had a dreaded disease when they were, in fact, perfectly healthy. One woman even planned her funeral.

Some are demanding compensation, while others are seeking criminal charges, arguing that a man who attacked them with a knife in the street would face jail.

Gail Boichat, a 57-year-old mother of three, who had an unnecessary mastectomy in 1995, said Mr Paterson should face the wrath of his patients.

‘He should be put in a room with the women he has operated on. With all 1,000 of them, that’s how we feel,’ she said.

A friend added: ‘We always say that. See what they do to him. Hack away bits of his body bit by bit like he did.’

'Victims': Gail Boichat, 57, left, said the surgeon should be put in a room with the women he has operated on, while Helen Gardiner, right, 41, said she felt like she had been 'assaulted'

Mrs Boichat, who is married to Alan, a
60-year-old construction manager, was treated by Dr Paterson at the 
Good Hope NHS hospital in Sutton Coldfield, West Midlands.

He
told her a lump in her right breast was cancerous and performed a 
cleavage-sparing mastectomy, which leaves some breast tissue behind for 
cosmetic reasons. The operation goes against national surgical 
guidelines because it increases the risk of cancer returning but Mrs 
Boichat was unaware of anything unusual.

Mr
Paterson also prescribed tamoxifen, a strong cancer drug which caused 
Mrs Boichat, who was 40 at the time, to go through a traumatic early 
menopause.

This 
February she was recalled to hospital and told the lump in her breast 
was a blocked duct rather than cancer and that she should never have had
her mastectomy.

Yesterday,
Mrs Boichat described how the news had left her feeling angry, confused
and guilty at having received sympathy from friends for so long.

Not
having her right breast was a constant cause of self-consciousness, she
said, adding: ‘There’s the scar to remind you. Now it reminds me that I
shouldn’t have had it and that I should look like any other woman. You 
can’t help it making you feel less feminine.’

Victoria Weaver, 42, said she planned her funeral after Mr Paterson told her she had cancer

Helen
Gardiner, 41, who runs her own recruitment company, found out last 
month that she was operated on by Mr Paterson five times unnecessarily.

The
mother of four, from Castle Bromwich, Birmingham, was told each time 
that she had pre-cancerous lumps in her breast but has since seen 
pathology reports that show only healthy tissue was removed.

She
was also recommended for a mastectomy by Mr Paterson but says she 
refused because she thought that was ‘drastic’ considering the supposed 
lumps were not cancerous.

‘I
don’t think a lot of people have ever experienced this. It’s a bit like
Harold Shipman,’ she added. ‘I put my trust in him. I feel extremely 
angry. He endangered my life. I feel like I’ve been assaulted.’

She said the surgeon should face criminal charges.

Paula Gelsthorpe, 54, from Birmingham, had needless lumpectomies in 2002 and 2009.The
dog groomer said the vicious street assault she suffered two years ago 
was not as bad as Mr Paterson ‘pretending he was the man who could save 
me’.

‘It is an assault
on the body and mind,’ she added. ‘He is a charming man and seemed so 
compassionate and understanding. I feel betrayed. He is a con man.’

Victoria
Weaver, 42, said she planned her funeral after being told by the doctor
that she had cancer. She is now waiting to find out if she ever, in 
fact, had the disease.

Mr Paterson worked at NHS and private hospitals across the Midlands from 1994 until he was suspended last month.

He
was first investigated by the Heart of England NHS Trust over his use 
of cleavage-sparing operations in 2004 and was told to stop performing 
them in 2007.

Seven hundred of the women he treated were then recalled to the hospital to have their conditions reviewed.

About
100 of his patients have launched claims for compensation and an NHS 
helpline has been set up for worried women to contact.

Police yesterday confirmed he is facing a criminal inquiry, although they said no arrests had been made.

Mr Paterson was not available for comment yesterday at his £1.4million mansion in Edgbaston, Birmingham.

Sorry we are unable to accept comments for legal reasons.
