Two weeks earlier, Charlie Astrand's father had proudly walked her up the aisle at her £20,000 wedding to one of his employees.

Less happily, he was at the airport to greet her when she returned from honeymoon – and announce that her husband had stolen £18,500 from the family business.

Graham Astrand, 53, who employed Huw Jones as a sales executive at his car dealership, made the shocking discovery of betrayal shortly after the couple's departure to the Caribbean.

Perfect wedding: Charlie Astrand, 25, with her new husband Huw Jones, 
31, on their wedding day. Charlie's father Graham is pictured left, and 
her mother Alison is right. But when she returned from honeymoon, the primary school teacher's dream turned into a nightmare

Yesterday Miss Astrand, 25, said her 'world came crashing in' when she learned that the man she had married was a fraud.

She and 31-year-old Jones had been away for only two days when Mr Astrand discovered his new son-in-law had fiddled the books.

He went to the police but was advised to let the couple finish their honeymoon before confronting his employee.

After paying for the white wedding and
contributing towards the two-week honeymoon on the island of Aruba, Mr 
Astrand waited at the airport arrivals lounge armed with proof of 
Jones's crimes. Miss Astrand, whose marriage collapsed at that point, 
said: 'It was the worst moment of my life – I had just had the most 
blissful honeymoon with the man I loved.

'But then everything was shattered. My world came crashing in on me.

'I saw my dad waiting to pick me up – 
he gave me the biggest hug I've ever had. But Huw's family were there 
too and they just sort of whisked him away without a word.

Anguish: Charlie, 25, with her father Graham who broke the news to her that her new husband had been stealing from the family home as he drove her back from the airport

'I asked my dad what was wrong and he just said, “Come to the car”.'

Miss Astrand was shown the paperwork 
which proved her new husband had helped himself to the cash from the 
family firm in Aberdare, South Wales.

She continued: 'I had a panic attack 
in the car – I couldn't take in what was happening. In the four years I 
had known him there was not the slightest clue anything was wrong.

'We lived together for two years and he was loving, caring and romantic, always spoiling me with presents and treats.

'My family thought the world of him – he was hard-working and committed to building a happy home and future for us.'

The post-honeymoon drama was revealed 
at Merthyr Tydfil Crown Court when Jones, the son of a policeman, 
admitted 24 charges of fraud, forgery and theft but was spared jail.

Picture perfect: Charlie's parents paid £20,000 for her wedding and contributed towards their two-week luxury honeymoon on the Caribbean island of Aruba

Wedding joy: Charlie, right, had no idea that Huw Jones was defrauding her father's company during her four-year relationship - until the news was broken to her after her honeymoon

His secret: Huw kept the deception from his new bride Charlie but has now admitted 24 charges of fraud, forgery and theft

Mr Astrand and his wife Alison were in court to hear how £18,478 'fell through the gaps' of the company accounting system.

Prosecutor Heath Edwards said: 'Jones 
had forged signatures, manipulated the accounts and sweetened deals. He 
forged documents and upped the amount of money in loan applications, 
unbeknown to customers.

'He did it to impress his fiancée and her family – and to up his sales figures for commission.'

The court heard Jones cunningly hid 
his dodgy dealings during his two-year engagement to his boss's 
daughter, leading up to their marriage in July 2010.

Mr Edwards said: 'Mr Astrand was waiting at the airport to confront his new son-in-law when he stepped off the plane.'

Laurence Jones, defending, said: 
'Jones had taken on responsibilities he could not cope with in an 
overwhelming desire to impress his future father-in-law.'

He added that Jones had 'learned a 
very long, hard salutary lesson and is remorseful for his actions'. 
Judge Dan Williams gave Jones a nine-month suspended jail sentence, 
telling him: 'I have given you a chance even though I am not convinced 
you deserve it. Please don't blow it.'

Joy that didn't last: Charlie, left, has now got a new boyfriend while Huw has remarried and become a father

Family delight: Charlie, 25, with her parents Graham and Alison on her wedding day in 2010. Days later Graham discovered Charlie's husband, and his employee, had been carrying out a deception

Con: When this picture was taken Huw Jones' deception was still a secret - but it unravelled days later

Jones was also ordered to carry out 250 hours unpaid work and complete a 'thinking skills programme'.

Afterwards Miss Astrand said: 'I was 
in tears again when I found out he was not going to jail. That would 
have been the right sentence for what he did to me and my family.

'I was terribly hurt and it's taken me two years to get over it.'

Jones remarried last month after becoming a father six months ago.

His ex-wife, who has started a new 
relationship with accountant Chris Henneman, said of her former husband:
'He has lived a happy life for the past two-and-a-half years – he's met
someone new, got married and even has a child. He still hasn't paid a 
price for everything he did. Every day we have to deal with it.

'We really thought he would go to 
prison and that would be the end of it. But I feel like he's had no 
punishment for the pain and hurt he's caused me and my family.'

She added: 'I have a very happy life with Chris, and it's because of him I am where I am today – he's been my rock.'

Mr Astrand said of the sentence: 'I 
wanted justice for Charlie and for our customers but he was let off with
a suspended sentence. That is a disgrace. He deserved to spend time 
behind bars for what he had done.'
