Chelsea are confident of beating Arsenal to Sami Khedira from Real Madrid.

Contract
 talks between Real and The 27-year-old German's representatives have 
broken down and they are willing to sell rather than let him go for free
 next summer.

Arsenal want Khedira but will pursue Bayer Leverkusen's Lars Bender if they lose out to Chelsea.

On target: Khedira got his name on the scoresheet during Germany's semi-final win against Brazil

Reunion: Jose Mourinho managed Khedira during his time as Real Madrid boss

Madrid
 had earmarked Ramires of Chelsea as a replacement for Khedira but may 
now opt for his compatriot Luis Gustavo at Wolfsburg.

The
 28-year-old Brazilian has been made to train with the reserves after 
expressing a desire to move but Atletico are determined to get their
