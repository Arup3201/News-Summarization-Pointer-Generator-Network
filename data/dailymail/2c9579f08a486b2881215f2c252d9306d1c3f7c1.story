The ‘original’ social network MySpace is being re-branded as a music streaming website set to compete with Spotify and Pandora, leaked documents show.

The former Facebook rival is trying to raise $50 million to finance next year’s relaunch hoping to attract investors with a new design and backing from superstar Justin Timberlake.

A presentation by Interactive Media Holdings, which bought MySpace from Rupert Murdoch’s NewsCorp in 2011, reveal the plans to move focus from social network to music.

The $35 million purchase, a mere six 
per cent of the original selling price, was partially funded by outside 
investors, including superstar Justin Timberlake.

The sale in June 2011 was a gigantic loss for Murdoch’s NewsCorp, which bough MySpace for $580 million in 2005.

At the time of the acquisition, 
musician-turned-actor Timberlake said there was a ‘need for a place 
where fans could interact with their favourite entertainers’.

While many artists and actors use 
Twitter to communicate with their fans, Timberlake said users will 
be drawn to MySpace as it also offers the opportunity to ‘listen to 
music, watch videos, share and discover cool stuff and just connect.’

New sell: By giving their users a way to 'connect' with their favourite artists, MySpace hopes to win over users of Spotify and Pandora

Hoping for growth: The company hopes to attract bands to their catalogue by offering details about fanbases and top fans

Timberlake added: 'Art is inspired by people and vice 
versa, so there's a natural social component to entertainment. I'm 
excited to help revitalise MySpace by using its social media platform to
bring artists and fans together in one community.'

Pandora and Spotify are online music streaming services with millions of users around the globe.

Spotify has a catalogue of 15 million songs and offers both a free service with advertisement and paid-for streaming.

The catalogue can be browsed by searching for an artist or a song but also by genre or user-generated playlists.

Users register through their Facebook account and after a six month free trial period with unlimited use, users are given ten free hours per month.

A paid subscription removes ads and gives the user unlimited listening time.

Pandora is an online radio service which plays music based on a song selected by the user, creating a ‘station’ with songs similar to the one suggested.

Pandora also offers a free service with advertisements, and a paid-for subscription without.

Despite their superstar backer, the new owners Interactive Media Holdings have yet to turn a real profit for MySpace.

Although MySpace has seen an increase in traffic by 36 per cent since December 2011, it only generated a mere $15 million in revenues this year.

The leaked presentation is optimistic about 
the future, predicting that the $50 million can turn the MySpace into a 
Spotify killer despite recording a $43 million loss in 2012.

The company intends to spend $10 
million on advertisement alone and plan to launch a mobile phone app 
where users can subscribe to their music streaming services, according 
to the presentation leaked to Business Insider.

The presentation brags about 
MySpace’s 42 million songs on offer – an advantage on both Spotify and 
Pandora which has catalogues of 15 million and 800,000 respectively – 
however 27 million of these are from unsigned artists.

Pitching this as a business advantage 
thanks to the low cost, Interactive Media Holdings also claim to have 
direct relationship with 5 million artists, yet fails to reveal how many
of these are signed to a record label.
