A man accused of faking brain cancer to scam donations from well wishers has finally ended up in hospital, after being savagely beaten in prison.

Kristopher Cook suffered a lacerated spleen, broken nose and other injuries during the attack.

The 28-year-old had been in jail less than 24 hours after being arrested when he was allegedly attacked.

Scam: Kristopher Cook made $7,500 at a phoney fundraiser he said was to pay for brain cancer treatment

His lawyer will tell a court in Calgary, Canada, on Friday that he is now in fear of his life.

Cook is expected to be released from hospital in time for his court appearance.

The music producer had told friends and well-wishes he had been diagnosed with the same sort of brain cancer that killed his sister.

A fundraiser to help pay for treatment was held last July at Calgary bar Broken City and raised $7,500, the Toronto Sun reported.

There friends gathered for a show headlined by popular indy band Miesha and the Spanks.

But suspicions about his illness were raised when those who took part in the fundraiser noticed his increased spending habits, including buying a $1500 Apple computer the day after the event.

'He was there, 
dancing around shirtless and drunk,' said Darren Ollinger, a former 
friend of Cook and one many who turned out for the fundraiser.

'If a guy has cancer, you have to show your support — everyone did.'

He was also seen drinking at bars when he was supposed to be undergoing treatment.

When police began investigating they discovered Cook did not have cancer and did not have a sister who died from the disease.

In a photograph taken by the Calgary Herald, Cook can be seen being led from a property wearing handcuffs, a smirk on his face.

Cook also said he was born in Texas and ineligible for Alberta Health Care.

He was arrested in Victoria, British Columbia, and transported to Calgary where he was held on remand.

The alleged prison beating took place inside his prison cell on Sunday hours after his arrival.

His lawyer Greg Dunn said they’re not entirely certain what motivated the attack, but assumes it’s related to the accusations against Cook.

'We don’t know the reason for it, I’m going on the premise it’s because of the charges he’s facing and the media coverage,' Dunn said.

The Calgary Police Service would not comment on Cook’s beating and would only confirm they are investigating an assault that took place there Sunday.

Cook faces two counts of fraud over $5,000.
