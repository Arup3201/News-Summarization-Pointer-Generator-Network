Half of people would vote to stay in the European Union if David Cameron succeeds in negotiating a new relationship, a survey revealed on the eve of the Prime Minister’s long-awaited speech on Europe.

Support for leaving the EU altogether is at its lowest level since December 2011, with 42 per cent of people saying they would vote to exit in a straight in/out referendum.

With Mr Cameron vowing to press ahead with his landmark speech in Amsterdam tomorrow morning, he will bolstered by the findings which show 50 per cent of people would vote to stay in the EU if he renegotiated the UK’s relationship with Europe and said that Britain's interests were now protected.

David Cameron, who will deliver his long-awaited speech in Amsterdam tomorrow, will be bolstered by the dwindling public support to leave the EU together

The PM tonight briefed US President Barack Obama on the content of the speech in an attempt to reassure the White House, after warnings from the administration that referendums could turn countries ‘inward’.

He also spoke to French President Francois Hollande today, after briefing Dutch PM Mark Rutte and German Chancellor Angela Merkel at the weekend.

The PM’s official spokesman said: ‘There’s a debate in Europe across the European Union, significantly driven by the events in the Eurozone.

There is a debate in Britain as well. The Prime Minister wants to play a leading part in that debate, changing the relationship with the EU and then seeking consent.

‘In all the calls that the Prime Minister has been make there is an acknowledgment that there is this debate going on throughout the European Union.’

Mr Cameron is expected to use the speech, first mooted in July last year, to set out a raft of powers he wants to claw back from Brussels.

He will argue that major change in the EU, with Eurozone countries moving closer together, presents an opportunity for Britain to seek concessions.

If he secures a better deal for Britain, he would hold a referendum and urge the public to support continued membership of the EU based on the ‘fresh settlement’.

But today Business Secretary Vince Cable warned there was a risk that Mr Cameron could end up taking Britain out of the EU 'by accident'.

'Once you talk about renegotiation you are opening up the possibility that if you don't get what you want, you leave - by accident or design,' he told BBC Radio 4's The World At One.

In a new YouGov poll published today, people were asked to ‘imagine if David Cameron renegotiated the UK’s relationship with Europe and said that Britain's interests were now protected, and recommended that Britain remain a member of the European Union on new terms’.

Among respondents 50 per cent said they would vote to stay in the EU, while only 25 per cent said they would still vote to leave. Five per cent would not vote and 20 per cent were unsure.

Asked how they would vote in a straight in/out referendum on Britain’s membership of the EU, 42 per cent said they would vote to leave, down from a high of 51 per cent in November and the lowest level since dropping to 41 per cent in December 2011.

Some 36 per cent now say they would vote to stay in the EU, up from 28 per cent in October. The rest are either unsure or wouldn’t vote.

Joe Twyman, YouGov director of political and social research, said: 'The key finding from all YouGov’s recent polls is that when it comes to our relationship with Europe, the British electorate does not support the status quo.

'What most people want is for Britain to stay part of the EU, but on what they regard as more favourable, renegotiated terms.'

Mr Cameron is under pressure from all sides, with Eurosceptic Tory MPs and the resurgent UK Independence Party demanding a tougher line towards exiting the EU.

Meanwhile, the Liberal Democrats and Labour are warning that raising the prospect of withdrawal but delaying a referendum until 2018 will damage business confidence in investing in Britain.

Labour leader Ed Miliband said said he backed the idea of clawing some powers back from Brussels

Labour leader Ed Miliband today 
backed Mr Cameron's call for powers to be clawed back 
from Brussels, but refused to give voters a say in a referendum.

As
the war of words escalated ahead of the Prime Minister's long-awaited 
Europe speech tomorrow, Mr Miliband warned talk of giving voters a say 
on a new deal with the European Union risked taking Britain to the edge 
of the 'economic cliff'.

But he said negotiations should start now on returning key powers on regional funding and industrial strategy to Westminster.

His
intervention came as senior City allies of Chancellor George Osborne 
clashed with Vince Cable today over the idea of staging a referendum on 
Britain’s place in the EU.

In
a provocative intervention the day before Mr Cameron’s key speech, 
Business Secretary Mr Cable warns it is a ‘terrible time’ for the 
‘diversion and uncertainty’ that will be caused to businesses by a 
referendum pledge.

‘Any 
reopening the question of British membership creates additional 
uncertainty when there is already fragile economic confidence in the 
wake of the financial crisis,’ the Lib Dem minister said.

'Any
reopening the whole question of British membership creates additional 
uncertainty at a time when there is already fragile economic confidence 
in the wake of the financial crisis. This uncertainty is potentially 
driving away investors and the jobs they create.'

However the warnings of a chilling effect 
on investment are today rejected by a group of City heavyweights, who are 
launching what is expected to be a concerted campaign to demonstrate 
business support for Mr Cameron’s stance.

In an open letter, they insist voters 
must be trusted to decide whether to sever ties with Brussels, saying: 
‘Pressure is growing from all sides for a referendum.’
