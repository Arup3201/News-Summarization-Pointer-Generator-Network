Prince William has had petrol bombs thrown at him during a training session, it was claimed today.

The private exercise at a police station comes as the 31-year-old Duke of Cambridge prepares to take on more royal duties and looks to ensure he can protect his family in the event of an attack.

The secret session was revealed by a daughter of one of the officers involved in the exercise, who wrote on a social network: ‘My dad threw a petrol bomb at Prince William - what a claim to fame’.

William was said to have visited the Metropolitan Police’s £50million facility in Gravesend, Kent, reported The Sunday Telegraph, three months after his wife Kate gave birth to Prince George.

His visit comes three years after dramatic pictures showed a shocked Duchess of Cornwall besieged by a mob in a royal limousine as she and Prince Charles were driven through London’s West End.

Camilla was jabbed in the ribs in the December 2010 attack, and their Rolls-Royce kicked, battered and splattered in paint - in what was seen as the most serious breach of royal security in years.

Charles made an official visit to the same Met training centre in Kent in 2009, where he witnessed mock fighting between policemen and ‘rioters’ armed with wooden bricks and petrol bombs.

The facility close to the River Thames provides a realistic environment for officers to practise real-life scenarios - with different courses available, such as commanding or being a front-line medical officer.

A Kensington Palace spokesman declined to comment when approached by MailOnline today, but a royal source confirmed that a 'private visit' to a police training facility took place.

The news follows reports that the couple are to shun royal tradition and choose close school and university friends to be George’s godparents, to give their son a sense of normality as he grows up.

Financier Fergus Boyd, who went to Eton with Prince William and shared a house with the couple at St Andrew’s University, will be one of George’s six godparents, it was claimed.

Kate’s school friend from Marlborough College, interior designer Emilia d’Erlanger, is also a contender, as is one of William’s oldest friends Hugh van Cutsem.
