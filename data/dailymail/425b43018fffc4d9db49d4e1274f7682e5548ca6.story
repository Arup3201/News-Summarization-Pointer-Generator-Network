A mother-of-four has admitted to spending more on treats for her dog than she does on her own children.

Leanne Couch, 28, spends £10,000 a year on Lucy, her 12-year-old Maltese, even giving her dog a £300 designer collar, £110 necklace and £400 personalised wooden bed.

In contrast Mrs Couch, who is married to Leigh, 28, refuses to spoil her three sons Leo, eight, Luis, three, Lacy, two, and her four-month-old daughter Livie.

Leanne says Lucy, who she has had since she was young, is her best friend ans she spends a few hundred pounds on her every month

Mrs Couch, of Newport, said: 'Lucy has been my pet since I was a child.

'She was the pet I had with my mum, Evelyn, when I was young. She was a little ball of white fluff and I fell in love with her straight away. She quickly became my best friend.

'I call her my ‘fur baby’ because she really does feel like one of my babies. To me, she’s my ‘firstborn’ and as she gets older, I find myself spoiling her even more.'

Mrs Couch, who runs the Mucky Pups dog salon in Cardiff, is reluctant to buy treats for her children because she does not want to spoil them.

Mrs Couch said: 'I don’t like it when children are spoiled. I want my children to know the value of things so I don’t feel guilty for not buying them whatever they want whenever they want.

'Lucy is another matter entirely - she’s a dog and buying things for her doesn’t change her personality.

'I spend a few hundred pounds on Lucy every month - if I see something new that she doesn’t already have, I have to get to get it for her. It’s mainly designer clothes which cut into my budget - as soon as a designer item hits the shelves I buy it for her.

'The children have never questioned it because they see Lucy as part of the family. Leigh loves Lucy too, so he goes along with whatever I want to buy her.'

At Christmas, Lucy has double the amount spent on her compared to the children. She usually receives a brand new bed, a new wardrobe of designer clothes and a full spa day.

Whereas Mrs Couch’s children have around £200 spent on them each at Christmas, Lucy receives £400 worth of presents.

The family pet has a life of luxury - from a £400 personalised wooden bed with a leopard print interior, to a wardrobe bursting with hundreds of designer clothes, leads and harnesses totalling thousands of pounds.

The dog has a designer collar costing £300, a £110 necklace which she wears on special occasions, and is pampered from nose to tail every single week.

She also only eats speciality dog food from feeding bowls embossed with her name.

Mr and Mrs Couch work an exhausting 90-hour week between them to fund Lucy’s lavish lifestyle, and Mrs Couch says she has sacrificed personal treats too.

She said: 'I don’t get my nails done anymore, and fake tans and blow drys are a thing of the past. But that’s how I choose to spend my money.

'We both work ridiculously long hours to keep both our businesses afloat - Leigh is a heating and gas engineer and often works more than 50 hours a week.

'I also have another job - I’m a retention consultant at the Royal College of Nursing. I don’t even take a wage from the dog salon - I spend it all on Lucy.

'Since opening the salon, life has been pretty hectic and we haven’t had a family holiday this year. But cutting back on the things we buy for Lucy is not really an option.”

Mrs Couch claims her desire to have a daughter also played a big part in how she treats Lucy.

She said: 'I love my boys dearly but for years I yearned for a little girl - someone to dress up in pink and spoil.

'I found myself buying all the little pampering treats and pretty clothes for Lucy which I would probably want to buy for a little girl.

'Now that Livie is with us I am buying girly clothes for her - but I don’t think I will stop spoiling Lucy anytime soon. Livie is far too young to appreciate her outfits anyway.'

Mrs Couch’s Cardiff salon - ‘Mucky Pups’, the first of its kind in Wales - opened its doors last year.

Lavishly decorated in pink and black, with plenty of sparkly accessories and fixtures, the salon is the ideal place for dog owners who want their precious pets to look like a million dollars. In the boutique part of the shop are rows of designer clothes, harnesses, carry-bags and even doggy pushchairs.

'Lucy was the inspiration behind Mucky Pups,' said Mrs Couch.

'I recognised there were probably thousands of other women who love to pamper their pets too.

Leanne says that despite the birth of her daughter Livie, she won't stop spoiling Lucy

'We get designer clothes imported from America and we have a wide range of pamper treatments on offer for the dogs. We recognise that dogs rarely like to be groomed and some find it a frightening experience. The spa is about making the whole thing more relaxing and enjoyable for them.

'If the dogs are happy, the owners are happy, and that’s what is all about.

And Lucy benefits greatly from her owner’s booming business - by getting pampered each and every week.

Mrs Couch said: 'Every week she is pampered all over - she has her fur dyed pretty colours, massages and a facial, and is always dressed to impress. People are often bowled over by how good she looks.

'I don’t want anyone to judge Lucy for looking scruffy - as the owner of a pampering parlour that would reflect badly on me too.

'She is mollycoddled a bit - we never leave her on her own and everywhere she goes she has a bag full of treats and clothes to wear in case she gets cold.

'But Lucy’s my little pup princess - why shouldn’t I treat her like royalty?'
