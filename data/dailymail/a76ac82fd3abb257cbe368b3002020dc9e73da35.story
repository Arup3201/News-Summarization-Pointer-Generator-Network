Around 700 doctors, nurses and health experts are calling on the Government to ban smoking in cars carrying children ahead of a Commons vote on Monday.

In a letter to the British Medical Journal (BMJ), respiratory experts said secondhand smoke was a ‘major cause of ill health in children’.

They said it was damaging to developing lungs, caused sudden infant death and resulted in thousands of hospital trips every year.

Ban: Hundreds of doctors have expressed support for a crackdown on smoking in cars

Signatories to the letter are being co-ordinated by Dr Nicholas Hopkinson from Imperial College London and chairman of the British Thoracic Society’s chronic obstructive pulmonary disease specialist advisory group.

The letter said ‘Secondhand exposure to tobacco smoke is a major cause of ill health in children.

‘Smoke inhalation damages the developing lung, and the Royal College of Physicians estimates that each year in the UK it is responsible for 300,000 primary care contacts, 9,500 hospital admissions, at least 200 cases of bacterial meningitis and 40 sudden infant deaths.

‘Most of this additional burden of disease falls on the more disadvantaged children in society, and all of it is avoidable.’

The Mail revealed last month that the ban could soon become law.

Deputy Prime Minister Nick Clegg says he does not support the policy. Mr Clegg, who smokes, said it was ‘a stupid thing to do when a child is in the back of a car’ but said he did not want to ‘sub-contract’ parenthood.

But the BMJ letter says those objecting to a change in law assumed there was a ‘right to force children to breathe tobacco smoke’.

Objectors ‘seem to value this more highly than the children’s right to breathe clean air’, it says.

The letter comes as a minister announced yesterday there would be a free vote in the Commons on the issue on Monday.

Transport minister Robert Goodwill told MPs he would vote in favour of the ban, having been forced to sit in the back of a car as a child while his father smoked.

The vote comes as the Children and Families Bill returns to the Commons.

The Bill was amended in the House of Lords last week after Labour tabled an amendment which would give the Health Secretary the power to make it illegal to smoke in a car carrying children.

Peers have now accepted a Government-backed version of the amendment.

Deborah Arnott, chief executive of health charity Ash, said ‘Every day doctors see children with illnesses resulting from exposure to second-hand smoke, causing harm which is entirely preventable.

‘We understand why they feel so strongly and support their call to put an end to children’s exposure to smoking in cars.’

Simon Clark, director of Forest, said ‘Smoking in cars with children is inconsiderate but there is a line the state shouldn’t cross when it comes to dictating how people behave in private places.

‘Very few adults smoke in a car with children these days. Government should take encouragement from that and focus on education not legislation.

‘We urge MPs to reject this unnecessary intrusion into people’s private lives and trust parents to make the right decision for their children without the need for heavy-handed state intervention.’
