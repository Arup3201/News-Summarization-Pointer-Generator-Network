Surrey opener Jason Roy is set to join the ranks of Kevin Pietersen in Australia's Twenty20 Big Bash League on a short-term deal with the Sydney Thunder.

The 24-year-old Surrey opener will step in for England one-day captain Eoin Morgan to play under Michael Hussey at the western Sydney-based franchise on a three-match deal.

Morgan's time with the Thunder comes to an end on January 1 when he'll link up with his England team-mates for the first time since the sacking of Alastair Cook ahead of their tri-series against Australia and India, and in the lead-up to the World Cup Down Under. 

Jason Roy has signed a three-match deal to play with the Sydney Thunder in Australia's Big Bash League

Roy's first appearance will come against Hobart Hurricanes on January 9 at Spotless Stadium.

Surrey opener Roy was top-scorer in the Natwest T20 Blast last season with 677 runs at 48.36

'The Big Bash is a huge competition for an overseas player to be involved in,' Roy said. 

'I'm looking forward to getting over there and playing in front of the big crowds with an amazing squad. 

'Hopefully I can get my name out there and show people what I'm about and help win some games for the Thunder.' 

Roy was the top scorer in last season's Natwest T20 Blast smashing 677 runs at 48.36 and made his England debut at Edgbaston against India.

Along with Hussey, the Thunder squad includes former Australia Test players Usman Khawaja, Nathan Hauritz and Andrew McDonald

Perhaps more significantly, South Africa-born Roy will be lining up alongside his childhood idol, Jacques Kallis. 

'Growing up in South Africa, I watched Jacques Kallis play a lot,' said Roy. 'To be able to play alongside him is going to be an amazing experience and I'm looking forward to picking his brain along the way.' 

Sydney Thunder General Manager Nick Cummins said he was 'delighted' to have secured the services of Roy, a genuine rising talent in limited overs cricket. 

'We are delighted to have Jason join the Thunder as Eoin's replacement,' said Cummins. 

Roy replaces Thunder import Eoin Morgan, who will join the England squad as captain on January 1 

The 24-year-old is particularly excited to be playing alongside boyhood hero Jacques Kallis in Sydney

'Jason is one of the most exciting young T20 batsmen in the world and he'll add some significant firepower to our batting lineup.'  

He also toured with the Lions side to Sri Lanka and South Africa in the winter and will rejoin the development side in South Africa in January, meaning he will miss the Thunder's final group game on January 22. 

In his latest knock for the Thunder, Morgan managed just six from 11 deliveries as his side fell 16 runs short of Sydney rivals the Sixers at Stadium Australia.

Riki Wessels (the Queensland-born, Nottinghamshire-based son of South Africa and Australia Test legend Kepler Wessels) top-scored for the Sixers with 50 as they set at target of 180 for 7 but it was too many for the Thunder despite a 42-ball 80 not out from Aiden Blizzard.
