A Cambodian activist who used her 'story' of being forced into the sex trade at a young age has resigned from her eponymous U.S.-based charity after an investigation into her past.

Somaly Mam shot to fame in recent years for her humanitarian work helping fight sex slavery, using a horrific story about her own personal experiences of being forced into- and then escaping- work as a prostitute.

Then-Secretary of State Hillary Clinton toured her charity's facilities in Siem Reap, Cambodia in October 2010, and she has attracted the attention of celebrity activists like Susan Sarandon and Meg Ryan.

Holes started showing in her story as she started contradicting the timelines of her abuse that she wrote about in her memoir and told in interviews with American talk shows and news publications.

Announcement: Somaly Mam's American foundation was created in 2007 and works closely with the international charity she and her ex-husband founded in 1996

Two of the young girls she brought to the press- one of whom was featured on the Oprah Winfrey Show and the subject of reporter Nicholas Kristof's column in The New York Times- have had their stories debunked as well.

She has now resigned from her eponymous American foundation, which was created in 2007 to help aid the efforts of an earlier international charity, AFESIP, that Mam and her ex-husband launched in 1996. The international charity has not made any statements about the latest allegations. 

A spokeswoman for the Somaly Mam Foundation told MailOnline that Mam 'is not currently employed by AFESIP' but is still known for her role as the charity's co-founder.

Somaly Mam claimed to be orphaned and taken in by a man she came to call her 'grandfather' who went on to rape her repeatedly and forced her to marry a soldier at the age of 14 before eventually being sold to a brothel.

She eventually escaped, met a French doctor who married her and took her back to Europe in the early 1990s where they launched their crusade to save other girls like her.

They returned to Cambodia, set up safe houses and provided resources for the 'thousands' of girls they rescued, all through a foundation they built in her name.

Accepting praise: Somaly Mam, pictured at left with a young girl she helped rescue from sex slavery, was named as one of Glamour magazine's women of the year in 2006 shortly after the publication of her book

Big names: Queen Latifah was the star to present Mam with the Glamour award in 2006

Newsweek wrote a cover story about her in their latest issue detailing the ways in which her fraud unravelled in recent months.

She and her now ex-husband, Pierre Legros, started to attract attention in the non-profit world and signed Mam up for interviews in order to promote their first organization, AFESIP, the full name of which in French meant 'Helping Women in Danger'.

In 1998, Mam gave a joint interview with one of the teenage girls she 'saved' named Meas Ratha, who told a harrowing tale of how she was sold to a brothel and held as a sex slave.

Last year, that same woman came forward and said that Mam had coached her to say she was a child prostitute.

'Somaly said that... if I want to help another woman I have to do (the 1998 interview) very well,' Ms Ratha, who is now in her early 30s, told Newsweek last year.

International attention: Then-Secretary of State Hillary Clinton toured Somaly Mam's charity AFESIP's rehabilitation facility and met with some of the survivors in October 2010

Fake stories: One of the poster children that Mam lauded in interviews was Long Pross (who Clinton is seen touching). Pross claimed she was an orphan living at a brothel whose pimp stabbed her in the eye; doctors records prove she was brought to the hospital by her parents and linked with Mam's group later

The second woman who Mam held up as the survivor of trauma was Long Pross, who was featured in an extensive profile and accompanying video by Nicholas Kristoff in The Times in 2009, where she told him that her eye had been gouged out by her violent female owner after Pross asked for time off from prostitution following her second painful abortion.

She told the same version of events to Oprah and in a PBS documentary, but Newsweek has now debunked that.

A doctor in Cambodia named Pok Thorn has before and after photos of Pross' eye when she was brought in- by her parents- at age 13.

This directly contradicts the timeline Pross had been espousing, since she had claimed to be sold to the brothel at that same age, and been working at the brothel for years- being given to at least four times to different men after being stitched up repeatedly and billed as a virgin- before her two abortions and brutal run-in with her boss who gouged her eye with a piece of metal.

The hospital where Dr Pok Thorn works, Takeo Eye Hospital, told Newsweek that they were the ones who put Pross in touch with Mam because they contacted her charity, AFESIP, to see if Pross could be enrolled in their vocational training course.

Selling her story: Mam, seen here during a Tyra Banks Show appearance in 2006, admitted that she lied to the United Nations about the Cambodian army killing some of the girls she rescued

Celebrity endorsements: Susan Sarandon is just one of the famous Hollywood stars who has been a champion of Mam's cause for years

Those who know her say that Mam had a similar alternative life story: her parents are alive and raised her. She was a well-known and popular girl who attended a local high school from 1981 to 1987 and is remembered by her classmates for regularly wearing pigtails to school.

She has also been caught in multiple lies on the public stage.

After telling the United Nations General Assembly in 2012 that eight girls her organization rescued were later killed by the Cambodian army in 2004, she admitted that she made up that story.

She also told Glamour magazine in 2006- when they named her one of their Women of the Year- that her teenage daughter had been kidnapped and her captors video taped her being gang raped- all as retribution for the work Mam was doing.

Her ex and the charity’s legal advisor both came out to say that she was never kidnapped but ran away with her boyfriend.

Vouching for her: Pulitzer Prize-winning New York Times columnist Nicholas Kristof, seen with her in 2012, wrote the foreward to her book and profiled one of the 'rescued' girls, whose story was proved a lie

'(With donors), she’s very polished and very on and very charming…exceedingly charming... and when people are not there, she can be tyrannical; she’s moody, she’s erratic, she’s entitled,' a former AFESIP volunteer psychologist told Newsweek about Mam.

In the statement issued by the Somaly Mam Foundation on Wednesday, they tell how they hired a third party law firm Goodwin Procter LLP to investigate Mam’s claims two months ago, and, upon hearing their results, they have now accepted her resignation.

‘The Foundation provided Goodwin Procter unfettered access to our information, documents, and staff, and, for the past two months, a team of Goodwin Procter legal professionals based out of Boston, San Francisco, and Hong Kong conducted an extensive investigation,’ the press release states.

‘As a result of Goodwin Procter’s efforts, we have accepted Somaly’s resignation effective immediately.

‘Despite our heartfelt disappointment, the work of the Foundation and our grant partners must and will carry on. We have touched the lives of over 100,000 women and girls. We have treated nearly 6,000 individuals at a free medical clinic in Phnom Penh’s red light district and engaged nearly 6,400 students in anti-trafficking activism.’
