Dangerous: John Moir 45, has now racked up an incredible 208 convictions and was caught driving while banned for the 37th time

One of Britain's most prolific criminal drivers is back behind bars after his 208th conviction, 37 of which were carried out behind the wheel.

John Moir, 45, of Ipswich, Suffolk, has been jailed for 16 weeks for driving while banned and uninsured, just two years after he almost killed a pedestrian in a brutal hit-and-run.

The reckless driver, who has clocked up more than 200 total crimes, has received a four month sentence after his Hyundai Lantra was spotted by police on May 23.

An officer gave chase and pulled him over, finding him in the passenger seat.

But his female companion, who was spotted walking around the car, then told police he had in fact been driving.

Moir served just nine months in prison after he nearly killed electrician Simon Jacobs, 43, in August 2010.

Moir jumped a red light and ploughed into him as his helpless victim crossed a road in Ipswich.

He then sped off, leaving him in a coma so serious that doctors told his devastated family he might die.

His terrible injuries included a fractured skull and jaw, two fractured 
eye sockets, a broken nose and one of his ears was almost severed.

But miraculously Mr Jacobs battled back from the brink of death, although he had to surrender his own driving licence because of the risk of epilepsy as a result of his injuries.

Furious Mr Jacobs said people Moir should be punished much more 
severely and should still be in jail.

'He nearly killed me,' he said.

'Do we have to wait for someone to actually lose their life, for him to 
kill someone before he is given the sentence he deserves?'

He added: 'I got lucky.

'If it had been a woman or a child he had hit, they probably would have died.

'He clearly has no regard for the law.'

But just just eight days after his release for this crime, he was convicted of his 35th and 36th disqualified driving offences and jailed for 14 months.

In addition to driving despite being banned and without insurance on August 16, 2011, Moir had stolen DVDs, gym clothing and a handbag from two cars.

Four days later he drove while banned and without insurance again. Moir also perverted the course of justice by giving police a false name.

Sentencing him at Ipswich Crown Court then Judge John Devaux told him: 'You show no sign of changing your ways.'
