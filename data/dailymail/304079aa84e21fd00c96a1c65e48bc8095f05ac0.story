Expensive railway fares mean consumers are paying up to three times more to travel around Britain on trains than planes, it was revealed today.

Advance air fares are cheaper than train prices on nine out of ten of the most popular long-distance routes between major cities - with the only exception being London to Manchester.

For travelling in five weeks’ time on September 23 and returning one week later, flying with EasyJet from Glasgow to Bristol will cost £53 - but the cheapest train ticket is a whopping £141.

And for Bristol to Edinburgh on the same dates, an EasyJet flight there and back is currently only £62, compared to £149 for a return train ticket with CrossCountry.

A similar gap can be seen on the Bristol to Newcastle route, with EasyJet flights costing £43 but the train coming in at £124. It is also much cheaper to fly from Glasgow to Cardiff than take the train.

The gap is much smaller for most other routes, although an exception is seen when travelling from London to Manchester, which is £26 on Virgin Trains but £111 by plane with Virgin Atlantic.

The routes with similar train and plane prices were London to Edinburgh, London to Inverness, London to Glasgow, Birmingham to Edinburgh, Birmingham to Glasgow and London to Paris.

The survey was originally carried out by The Sun on Sunday, but MailOnline has also independently researched the prices using the Skyscanner and The Trainline comparison websites.

It’s certainly a reason to call it ‘cattle class’.

Train passengers get less space than livestock when being transported, it was revealed today.

The Government has assumed that non-seated train passenger occupies 0.25m2 of floor area - about the size of a sofa cushion.

Now more than 1,700 new train carriages for services in London and the South East are being built with the thinking that four people can occupy every m2 of standing space.

But European Union animal welfare regulations say that at least 0.3m2 must be given to calves and adult goats when transporting them, reported The Sunday Times. Unshorn sheep weighing less than 55kg (8st 9lbs) should have the luxury of between 0.3m2 and 0.4m2.

The revelation comes after it was revealed that millions of rail commuters will be hit by crippling price hikes of up to £200 for their annual season ticket, in a move attacked as ‘bad for the economy’.

In a bitter blow for passengers, it was announced last week that fares will rise by an average of 4.1 per cent in January, far higher than the pay rise that the majority of workers can expect.

Over the past decade, the cost of many annual season tickets for the growing number of workers who commute into London has risen by more than 50 per cent.

Skyscanner spokesman Mary Porter told The Sun on Sunday: ‘Our research shows that more often than not, it's cheaper to take a domestic flight than a train.

‘There is now more competition in the skies, particularly with the recent launch of Virgin Atlantic's Little Red, which is operating several domestic routes. More competition usually means better prices for flights.’
