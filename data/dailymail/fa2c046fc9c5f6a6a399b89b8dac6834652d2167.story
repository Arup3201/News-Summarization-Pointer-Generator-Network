Dusan Tadic ensured that Southampton remain the spot-kick kings of the Premier League with his penalty against Chelsea on Sunday.

The Saints have a near perfect record when it comes to penalties in the Premier League era, scoring 52 of their 55 kicks for a 95 per cent success rate.

During their time in the Premier League they have had two of the best penalty takers around. 

In the 1990s and early 2000s, Matt Le Tissier was the designated penalty taker – and his career record was 47 goals from 48 kicks - which is one reason why their record is so impressive.

Dusan Tadic scores from the spot against Chelsea - Southampton's 52nd success in the Premier League era

Matt Le Tissier only missed one penalty during his career - against Nottingham Forest in 1993

His sole failure to score came in March 1993 in a match against Nottingham Forest, his effort being saved by keeper Mark Crossley.

Since promotion back to the Premier League in 2012 they had Rickie Lambert with a perfect record from the spot - six from six in the Premier League before his transfer to Liverpool.

Of the teams who have been ever present in the Premier League since its inception back in 1992, Chelsea have the best record with a success rate of 88 per cent (99 goals from 113 penalties).

Liverpool have been awarded the most penalties of all the clubs that have been in the Premier League since the first season with 132 - of which they scored 101 (77 per cent success rate). 

Aston Villa have scored just 64 of their 95 spot kicks (67 per cent) since 1992 – the lowest of the ever-present teams.

Manchester United have had some excellent penalty takers over the years with Eric Cantona, Ruud van Nistelrooy and Cristiano Ronaldo all proving lethal from 12 yards – but they are down in mid-table with 77 per cent (89 goals from 116 attempts)

QPR are struggling at the bottom of the table and they have the worst penalty record from their years in the Premier League with just 12 goals from their 18 attempts (67 per cent).
