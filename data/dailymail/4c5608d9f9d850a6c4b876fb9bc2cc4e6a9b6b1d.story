Burmese investigators have said they believe the Myanmar migrant workers accused of murdering two
British tourists in Thailand are innocent, but witnesses who
might be able to prove this are too afraid to testify.

Zaw Lin and Win Zaw Htun are on trial for the murder of 24-year-old David Miller and the rape and murder of Hannah Witheridge, 23, on the island of Koh Tao in September.  

The migrant workers, both 21,
initially confessed to the murders but later retracted their
confessions saying they had been beaten and threatened by Thai
police.

But Thai police deny those accusations and say they have
solid evidence, including DNA evidence, against the two men who
were arrested in October.

A committee set up by Myanmar's embassy in Thailand to
investigate the case said they had interviewed about 40 Myanmar
nationals who were working on Koh Tao at the time of the
murders.

Some of those interviewed were 'strong witnesses' who might
provide evidence to exonerate the accused, said Kyaw Thaung, who
heads the committee. 

But he said that they were reluctant to testify and had
returned to Myanmar for fear of being implicated in the crime.

'If they go to court and speak as witnesses, they'll have
problems with the Thai police and Thai bosses,' Kyaw Thaung told
reporters in Yangon, Myanmar's largest city.

Thai Police Major General Suwat Jaengyordsuk, defended the 
investigation, which he led, and said Myanmar was welcome to
present witnesses.

The workers pleaded not guilty on December 8 to charges including
conspiracy to commit murder and rape. The first hearing in the
case will take place on December 26.

'Whatever the Thai government decides in this case, we
believe these two young people did not commit this crime,' said
Htoo Chit, the Myanmar committee's spokesman.

The murders of the two tourists dealt a blow to Thailand's vital tourism industry, which generates almost 10 per cent of the  gross domestic product.

The country was already struggling to recover from months of political upheaval that culminated in a May 22 coup, with the unrest keeping some visitors away, and the government called on police to solve the case quickly.

But human rights groups have accused Thai authorities of using the men as scapegoats.

The two suspects were paraded in front of cameras after apparently making murder confessions, but it was reported that a Burmese embassy official later formally retracted their confessions amid allegations the pair were tortured.

In November British detectives traveled to Thailand to review the police investigation into the murders after widespread criticism of blunders including allowing reporters to trample over the crime scene. 

But last month, the victims' families said they had seen strong evidence against the suspects and expressed confidence in the case. 

'There is a great deal of detail and vast areas of investigative work which has been shared with us,' Ms Witheridge's family said in a statement released through Britain's Foreign Office.

'We would like to stress that as a family we are confident in the work that has been carried out into these atrocious crimes.'

Mr Miller's family has urged restraint from rights groups and the media while the court case unfolds.

'The support for the Myanmar suspects has been strong and vocal, but please do not jump to conclusions until you have considered the evidence from both sides in full,' Miller's family said in its statement.

They added: 'They must respond to these charges, and their arguments must be considered with the same scrutiny as those of the prosecution.

'Please remember that this is above all a story of two wonderful young people, David and Hannah, killed in the prime of their lives in a senseless and brutal way.'
