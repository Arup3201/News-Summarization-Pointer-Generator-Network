On trial: Kirk Thompson, 46, allegedly killed David Kochs, 43, during a drug-fuelled sado-masochistic sex session at his home in Jesmond, Newcastle

A former Government vet killed a man during a drug-fuelled sado-masochistic sex session, before covering his body with a duvet and having sex with someone else, a court has heard. 

Kirk Thompson, 46, allegedly caused severe internal injuries to David Kochs, 43, during the episode at his home in Jesmond, Newcastle.

He then reportedly covered his body with a duvet, before having sex with another man. 

He pleaded not guilty to charges of manslaughter, unlawful wounding and assault at Newcastle Crown Court today. 

Thompson, who previously worked as an animal welfare adviser for the Department for Environment, Food and Rural Affairs, had made contact with Mr Kochs via the internet before the sex session at Dulverton Court, the court heard.

During the incident, both men are alleged to have taken the drug crystal meth - before Thomspon reportedly burnt, cut and assaulted his victim, leaving him with severe internal injuries.

At some point, he became aware that Mr Kochs was either dead or unconscious - and covered his body with a duvet on the floor of his living room, the court heard.

He then allegedly invited another man - who he had also met online - to his home for sex.

Robert Smith QC, prosecuting, said Mr Kochs had suffered a 'large number of injuries' during the episode on March 2 last year.

He told the jury: 'The case you are to try over the next few weeks as the jury in this trial is an unusual one. It is also a very disturbing one.

'Some of the injuries are likely to have been done with the deceased's agreement as part of sado-masochist sexual activity.

'It is sufficient to say at this stage it involved the use of knives and instruments to burn David Kochs in various areas of his body.'

Scene: The former vet reportedly caused severe internal injuries to Mr Kochs during the episode at Dulverton Court (pictured) He then allegedly covered his victim's body with a duvet, before having sex with another man

Appearance: Thompson, pictured arriving at court today, allegedly took the drug crystal meth before the sex session. He is claimed to have burnt, cut and assaulted Mr Kochs, leaving him with severe internal injuries

'The evidence establishes the defendant clearly enjoyed inflicting pain on others and, in this instance, David Kochs.'

Mr Smith added that some of the knife wounds appeared to have been inflicted on Mr Kochs after he had died.

The morning after the incident, Thompson messaged his father, saying: 'Can you come 
down immediately, something tragic has happened, just you not Mum please
 ASAP', the court heard.

Case: Thompson pleaded not guilty to charges of manslaughter, unlawful wounding and assault at Newcastle Crown Court (pictured) today. However, he admitted possessing the drug crystal meth. The trial continues

After arriving at the flat, his father quickly dialled 999 - prompting paramedics and police officers to arrive at the scene.

They found Mr Kochs lying dead on the 
living room floor - partially covered by a duvet and wearing only a pair
 of leather ankle boots.

Thompson told police that he had engaged in 'extreme, no limits, anything goes' sex with Mr Kochs after taking crystal meth.

He added that he had covered the victim with a duvet because he believed he had fallen asleep.

Mr Smith said: 'The defendant told a police officer he had engaged in what he described as "extreme, no limits sex" with the man. He told the officer what he did was consensual.'

Thompson has admitted possessing crystal meth, but denies the other three charges.

The trial continues.
