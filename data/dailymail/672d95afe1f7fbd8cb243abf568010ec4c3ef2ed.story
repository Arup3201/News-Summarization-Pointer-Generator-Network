A judge set bail at $1.22 million for a 23-year-old Saudi Arabia air force sergeant jailed on New Year's Eve after he was accused of raping a 13-year-old boy in a Las Vegas Strip hotel room.

In Las Vegas Justice Court on Friday, defense attorney Don Chairez says he believes police unfairly questioned Mazen Alotaibi because he was too drunk on cognac to surrender his right to a lawyer after the alleged December 31 attack.

Alotaibi stood in court with an Arabic language interpreter and said nothing, while judge Bill Kephart called the allegations against him 'appalling.'

Chairez said his client would plead not guilty to all charges but recommended that Alotaibi remain in jail until an evidence hearing on January 31.

Prosecutors added two lesser charges 
alleging lewdness with a minor to the kidnapping, sexual assault with a 
minor, coercion and burglary charges that could put Alotaibi in prison 
for life if he is convicted.

Alotaibi was 
arrested in Las Vegas after police say he pulled the boy, who is younger than 14, into his room at the Circus Circus hotel and raped him.

‘There was a kidnapping and sexual 
assault with force,’ Las Vegas police Lt. Dan McGrath said. ‘The victim 
said he was forced into the room and sexually assaulted. We have a 
strong case based on the evidence.'

The boy, who lives out of state, was staying at the hotel with his family, McGrath said. He was taken to a hospital for medical treatment and evidence collection and released later to family members.

According to the police reported cited by the Las Vegas Review-Journal, three other men were in Alotaibi's room smoking marijuana.

Alotaibi told police he was drinking Hennessy all night and was drunk when he met the boy. He first denied allegations, but later admitted to raping the teen after he refused to have sex with him for money.

The report stated that the 23-year-old Saudi national told investigators that he had the boy perform oral sex on him 'for just a couple of seconds,' and then 'accidentally' raped him.

McGrath said Alotaibi produced a Saudi Arabian military identification and said he was stationed at Joint Base San Antonio-Lackland near San Antonio, Texas.

U.S. federal authorities and Saudi military officials were notified, the police lieutenant said.

Joint Base San Antonio-Lackland spokesman Brent Boller told The Associated Press that records showed Alotaibi is currently stationed at Keesler Air Force Base in Biloxi, Mississippi.

Boller said he could not immediately verify if Alotaibi had been at Lackland, but noted that international military students attend a Defense Language Institute English Language Center on the base to improve their English-language skills.

Chairez of Newport Beach, California, said earlier in the month that he had been in contact with U.S. military authorities at both air force bases and with the Saudi government.

He said Alotaibi had come to Las Vegas for the New Year's celebration. Alotaibi also is charged with burglary, which in Nevada can stem from a person entering a building with intent to commit a felony.

The alleged attack took place on the sixth floor of a 15-story hotel tower. Circus Circus has a total of 3,767 guest rooms in three towers and five three-story motor lodge-style buildings dubbed Circus Circus Manor.

The arrest was first reported by the Las Vegas Review-Journal. It cited a police report saying the boy was 13.

Saudi Arabia operates under Sharia, or Islamic, law and punishes homosexuality, or sodomy, with sentences of corporal and capital punishment.

Saudi law also bans the consumption of alcohol. Those found guilty of drinking liqour could face anything from several weeks to several months in jail.
