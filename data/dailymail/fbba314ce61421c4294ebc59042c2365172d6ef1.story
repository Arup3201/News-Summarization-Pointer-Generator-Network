When most fathers discover their daughter is getting married, they set to work planning a witty speech.

But when John Butcher's little girl tied the knot, he wanted to go one better than that.

So the 50-year-old from Allington, Kent, spent 200 hours learning to sing so that he could surprise his daughter, Natalie, by serenading her on her wedding day.

John had secret singing lessons for more than six months and practised for 180 hours at home so he could be pitch perfect when he performed in front of 100 people on the big day.

Not your average speech: John Butcher surprised guests at his daughter's wedding by breaking into song

Well-rehearsed: The production manager had secret lessons to help him learn how to carry a tune

Only John's son Chris, 26, knew of his plans after the production manager hired singing coach Darren Eiffert to help him. 

The father-of-two then belted out a version of the Elvis classic 'Always On My Mind' to his shocked daughter during her wedding reception at The Orangery at Turkey Mill, Maidstone, in October. 

Natalie, 26, who married software developer Ian Wright, 29, said her father's song was the icing on the cake of their special day.

She said: We had the most amazing day which was finished off perfectly with the surprise of my dad singing after the speech. I was in shock but touched by the choice of song and the amount of effort that had gone into the preparation. Everyone seemed to be as blown away as I was and it is something I will never forget.'

John's wife, Mel, 47, was equally as shocked and touched by her husband bursting into song. 

John said: 'My wife Mel was in tears as she knew nothing about the performance and my daughter told me afterwards that it was the closest she came to crying throughout the whole ceremony.'

The father-of-the-bride said he came up with the idea to sing at the reception in April but as he confessed he wasn't previously able to carry a tune, he signed up for lessons to help him impress the wedding guests.

He said: 'I really can't sing and don't pretend to. I spoke to Darren in April about the idea and started lessons in May.

'I've had a lesson every other week and have practised the song for an hour a day since then.'

His hard work paid off and people clapped and cheered John's performance - which was filmed in full by one of the guests and then uploaded to YouTube. 

John said: 'Everyone thought the DJ had mucked up, but then I got up and started singing. People were laughing and crying and standing up waving their hands.

'People came up afterwards and said they didn't know I could sing.'

Housewife Mel, said she was proud of her husband's efforts to make their daughter's day even more memorable.

She said: 'I generally wise up to exactly what he is up to, I can't believe he managed to keep it a secret for so long.

'I was laughing and crying, I had my face in a serviette, it was very emotional and I was very proud of him especially as he's not the kind of person to put himself at the centre of attention.'
