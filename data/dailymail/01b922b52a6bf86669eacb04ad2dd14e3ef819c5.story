Christopher Copeland, 51,  is facing jail for pocketing £300,000 in donations meant for the forces charity Help for Heroes

A conman has admitted pocketing £300,000 of donations meant for the Help for Heroes charity.

Christopher Copeland, 51, recruited teams of workers to set up donation stations at supermarkets around the country over an 18-month period.

The teams would use Copeland’s fleet of ex-military vehicles, in Help for Heroes livery, and encourage shoppers to put money into charity buckets.

They then handed the cash over to 'greedy' Copeland, of mid Devon, who transferred it into his personal bank accounts.

Exeter Crown Court heard the scam took place between February 1, 2010, and September 17, 2011, when Copeland was arrested.

He admitted one charge of fraud by false representation and a charge of concealing criminal property, relating to the stolen donations.

Judge Philip Wassall adjourned the case for pre-sentence reports but warned Copeland he faced a 'lengthy' custodial sentence.

'It is difficult to imagine a fraud with greater aggravating features,' the judge said. 'He will know that he faces a lengthy prison sentence.

'He had better sort his affairs in order in the meantime.'

The fraud charge states that Copeland took the donations knowing that he did not intend to pass them on to Help for Heroes, contrary to Section 1 of the Fraud Act.

Prosecuting, David Sapiecha, said Copeland will now face proceedings under the Proceeds of Crime Act.

Representing Copeland, Rosaleen Collins said her client and his family had been subjected to attacks at their home since his arrest.

'When this matter was publicised before there were some serious threats to Mr Copeland and his family to such an extent that police had to fit an alarm in his property,' she said.

Speaking outside court, a tearful Copeland apologised for his behaviour and said he would use his 'life’s work' to pay the money back.

'I tried to do something that was really good and I messed up,' he said. 'I am very sorry. I would really, really like to make amends.

'I am really sorry and I will do anything I can.'

Detective Chief Inspector Mike Robison, also speaking after the hearing, said the deception was uncovered when one of Copeland’s workers became suspicious.

Mr Robison said Copeland had a number of vehicles, including a large personnel carrier and an ex-military Land Rover, in Help for Heroes livery.

Officers have uncovered at least 15 occasions where Copeland’s collecting team operated at supermarkets such as Tesco, Asda and Sainsbury’s, around the country.

The workers, who were paid expenses, would stay in Copeland’s vehicles or a nearby hotel and spend between three and four days a week collecting donations.

'We believed his motive was greed,' Mr Robison said. 'It is a rare occurrence and one that we have taken seriously along with Help for Heroes and the Crown Prosecution Service to arrive at a successful outcome.

'It was a charity collector that raised the issues with us in the first place.'

Jo Brookes, Help for Heroes’ Income Protection Officer, said: 'We’re appalled that Chris Copeland exploited the goodwill of so many people towards our wounded men and women in such a calculated, devious way.

'The money he stole never reached us, or the thousands of Heroes we support, because he used organised, criminal tactics to intercept it.

'Help for Heroes is grateful to our local fundraiser who first spotted what Copeland was doing, and to the police and the courts who have made sure he didn’t get away with it.'

The charity celebrated breaking the £100 million mark in 2011 thanks to the public’s support and fundraising events. 

Copeland, who was released on bail, will be sentenced at Exeter Crown Court on September 15.
