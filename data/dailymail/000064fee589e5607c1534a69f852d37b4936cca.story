Sky have won the bidding war for the rights to screen Floyd Mayweather v Manny Pacquiao in the UK, as revealed by Sportsmail last Friday.

The richest fight of all time will not come cheap either — for Sky Sports or their subscribers — even though Sky are keeping faith with their core following by keeping the base price below £20.

It has taken what is described by industry insiders as ‘a very substantial offer’ for Sky to fend off fierce competition from Frank Warren’s BoxNation.

The price for the fight has been set at £19.95 until midnight of Friday May 1. 

The cost will remain the same for those paying via remote control or online, but will be £24.95 if booked via phone after Friday.

Sky are flirting with their threshold of £20 by charging £19.95 a buy on their Sports Box Office channel until midnight on May 1, rising to £24.95 on May 2, the day of the fight in Las Vegas. Since they are understood to have broken past protocol by offering the US promoters a cut of that revenue as well as a hefty up-front payment, it is expected they will have to shatter the pay-per-view record in this country to break even.

The current Sky record stands at 1.2million buys for Ricky Hatton’s Vegas loss to Mayweather in 2007.

Warren is believed to have offered a higher lump sum than Sky in the hope of attracting another two million customers to his £12-a-month subscription channel.

It is doubtful if Sky can reach that number at £20 per sale at 4am on a Sunday morning, but if they get 1.5m buys they should be out of the red.
