Maureen Williams has been jailed for 15 months after she stole £170,000 from the account of an elderly dementia sufferer she had befriended

A building society clerk who stole £170,000 from the account of an elderly dementia sufferer she had befriended has been jailed for 15 months.

Maureen Williams, 59, took advantage of Betty Holland, 87, when she offered to help her with her finances.

She wrote cheques to herself, which she got her confused victim to sign, and handed out the money to her family so they could buy houses.

Jailing her for 15 months at Exeter Crown Court, in Devon, Judge Geoffrey Mercer described her crime as a 'gross breach of trust'.

He said: 'You had got to know her as a customer at the building society where you worked and you took on the role as her financial adviser and also became a friend.

'At the time of these offences she was clearly, in my view, suffering from dementia or at the very least the onset of dementia. You must have known that from your contact with her.

'In writing out cheques for yourself for her to sign and in making transfers, you took very dishonest advantage of her and it was a gross breach of trust.'

The court heard the pair met when Williams was a clerk at a building society branch in Bristol, and were friends for a number of years before she started stealing.

Williams, of Winscombe, North Somerset, denied three counts of fraud but was convicted by a jury at Bristol Crown Court on October 17.

Sentencing her in Exeter on December 6, Judge Mercer said: 'The money was used in part to buy your son a property and I have set a timetable for confiscation proceedings and expect the money to be repaid.

'I have read a lot of glowing references about you and I have read the medical reports which describe the disease you are suffering from, which carry substantial weight in my sentencing judgment.

'However, this was dishonesty on a scale which must command an immediate prison sentence.'

Giles Nelson, mitigating, said Williams is in poor health and her condition means that any jail sentence will be more difficult to cope with than if she had been younger and less frail.

Williams first met her victim when she became her financial adviser at the Bradford & Bingley building society branch in Keynsham, near Bristol, 15 years ago.

Williams later left to become a freelance Independent Financial Adviser and Ms Holland, who lived in Farmborough near Bath, became her client.

Prosecutors claimed Williams spent eight years grooming the widow into entrusting her with all her financial affairs.

And when Ms Holland - who had no children - developed dementia Williams saw her chance to cash in.

She wrote out a number of large cheques, including one for £75,000, which confused Ms Holland would sign at her request without knowing what they were for.

The fraud was only uncovered when Ms Holland collapsed at home in November 2009 and was taken into hospital.

Her relatives became concerned about her finances and began to investigate and Williams was arrested in 2010.

Ms Holland's cousin Rachel Smith, 45, of Melksham, Wiltshire, said: 'By the end Betty didn't know what she was doing because of her dementia.

'She (Williams) would put cheques in front of her and she would sign them. Betty trusted her completely - after all, who wouldn't trust a financial advisor?

'You should never take advantage of vulnerable people like this. But she just got greedy.'

Williams was arrested in 2010 and denied any offences. She said the money was a gift and had no reason to disclose it to the Holland family.

After sentencing, Detective Constable Sandy Osborne, who led the investigation, said: 'This kind of dishonesty offence is rarely brought to the notice of the police and I am delighted that justice was done in this case.

'Judge Mercer's sentence should act as a warning to others who abuse their position of trust to prey on vulnerable members of society.'

Legal action is now underway under the Proceeds of Crime Act to recover the money Williams unlawfully obtained.

Ms Holland, who ran a garage with her late husband, now lives in a nursing home in Trowbridge, Wiltshire, and has severe dementia.
