A young mother died from cervical cancer – after being turned down for a smear test nine times by her GP.

Jess Evans, 22, visited her local surgery nine times in two months complaining of stomach pain, fatigue and abnormal bleeding.

But doctors repeatedly sent her away, saying her symptoms were caused by her body getting back to normal after the birth of her son Riley.

Jess Evans, 22, died in February having been diagnosed with advanced cervical cancer last April. She visited doctors nine times repeatedly complaining of stomach pain, abnormal bleeding and bloating

But doctors told Miss Evans, left, and her mother Marie, right, that her symptoms were the result of her having just given birth to her son Riley, and added that due to her age there was 'no cause for concern'

Miss Evans, pictured with her mother Marie (right) passed away in February this year. Her mother is now campaigning to lower the smear test age from 25 to 16, believing had her daughter been tested at 16, it might have saved her life

They failed to give her a smear test, as the national minimum screening age is 25, and told her there was ‘no cause for alarm’.

Miss Evans, from Hagley, Worcestershire, was finally sent for a camera scan last April at her local hospital, but the test was too late to save her.

As her terrified mother Marie looked on, the doctor who carried out the procedure exclaimed: ‘Oh my God, how long have you been like this?’

Miss Evans, a care worker, was given just ten months to live and died this February.

Now her mother is backing an e-petition calling on the Government to lower the smear test age from 25 to 16. She believes her daughter would still be alive had she been offered a test.

Mrs Evans, 46, from Oldbury in the West Midlands, told ITV’s This Morning her daughter had ‘not long had a baby when her symptoms appeared’. 

Mrs Evans told This Morning she is desperate to raise awareness of cervical cancer and said she wants to see the age at which women are first asked for a smear test lowered from 25 to 16 

Dr Dawn Harper told This Morning the age limit for smear tests was raised from 20 to 25 after concerns high numbers of young women were receiving treatment they didn't need.

She said: 'The age limit used to be over 20 in England. 

'The reasons it was changed was based on National Screening Community, it wasn't financially driven.

'The cervix systems develop in the early 20s for a lot of women.

'We were getting multiple abnormal smear results for lots of young girls, which were causing anxiety and some were having treatment that wasn't absolutely necessary, and increased the risk of premature labour or miscarriage if they got pregnant later in life.

'The thinking was cervical cancer is very rare under 25 and so the age of screening should be raised.

'That is awful for you to hear (Mrs Evans).

'It is really important that while we don't screen under 25s, anyone suffering abnormal bleeding must always, always, report it to their doctor.

'I have a rule of threes, if someone comes back with the same symptoms three times I am not getting it.

'My advice is don't be scared to ask for a referral for a second opinion.'  

She added: ‘That is what they were putting it down to, that and her age.

'She was having bleeding and she wasn’t feeling very well, really tired all the time. She kept going and they kept telling her she was anaemic.

‘We really thought something wasn’t right. She went back to the doctors nine times. But you never expect the C word, that’s not something you think.’

Recalling her daughter’s diagnosis, Mrs Evans said: ‘Jess was hysterical. I just went numb, I had no words.

'I don’t actually know how we got home that day. You go into this world, a frozen state, I couldn’t think of anything.’

Mrs Evans gave up her job to care for her daughter, and eventually moved in with her.

She told baby Riley, now two, that his mummy was poorly. ‘He would kiss her tummy,’ Mrs Evans said, adding: ‘He is always asking for his mummy.’

Miss Evans’s brother James said: ‘She got so ill, Riley couldn’t cuddle her. I think that’s what broke her.’

And Mrs Evans added: ‘She was fobbed off time and time again.’ The NHS offers cervical screening tests to all women aged 25 to 64. They identify abnormalities which could develop into cancer.

The lower age of 25 was raised from 20 in 2003 after advice from the Advisory Committee on Cervical Cancer Screening.

Experts were mindful of how rare the disease is in women under 25, and feared the test could provide abnormal results which sometimes left women receiving treatment they didn’t need. 

About 2,900 cases of cervical cancer are diagnosed each year in the UK.

The symptoms aren't always obvious and may not appear until the disease has reached an advanced stage.

In most cases, abnormal bleeding is the first sign. It usually occurs after sex although any unusual bleeding should be investigated.

Other symptoms include pain in and around the vagina during sex, an unpleasant smelling discharge and pain when passing urine.

If the cancer has spread there may be other symptoms including constipation, blood in the urine, loss of bladder control, bone pain and swelling in the legs and kidneys.

The NHS offers a free cervical screening test to all women aged 25-64 every three to five years.

It is not a test for cervical cancer, but it identifies early abnormalities which, if left untreated, could develop into cancer of the cervix (neck of the womb).

If you are concerned about symptoms but are under 25 you have the right to an internal examination.

Maddy Durrant, of Jo's Cervical Cancer Trust, says: 'There is a pathway in place that means a patient should be checked or referred if they are exhibiting symptoms.

'We advise women to challenge their doctor if they say they do not need a test.'

She adds that it can help if you print out a list of symptoms, such as from the charity's website, to make your point understood.

'Cervical cancer is rare in women under 25, but it's not impossible.'
