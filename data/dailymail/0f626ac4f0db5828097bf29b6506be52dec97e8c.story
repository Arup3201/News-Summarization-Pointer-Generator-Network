The attorney for a woman who nearly died after unknowingly drinking toxic iced tea at a Utah restaurant says an employee at the eatery burned herself a month earlier on the same chemical cleaning compound.

Lawyer Paxton Guymon said Thursday the former Dickey's Barbecue employee burned her tongue July 5. He says she stuck her finger in a sugar container and licked it to see if it contained any of the chemical cleaner.

Guymon says he's appalled that the South Jordan restaurant didn't get rid of the sugar container mixed with the chemical lye before it ended up in the tea that Jan Harding drank August 10.

Injuries: Jan Harding (left), a mother of three, suffered deep burns to her upper esophagus and was in critical condition for a week after drinking the tea. Her husband Jim spoke Thursday and said he's grateful she's finally getting better after being on the brink of death

On Thursday, Harding's husband Jim announced that she is recovering well.  He says he's not upset and doesn't want retribution for what happened. 

'I’m just grateful for each day,' he said. 'I’m grateful that she’s getting better. I’m grateful that she has a voice. I’m grateful that the life and death thing has been taken off the table. I’m just grateful for where we are. I bring you a good word today, an encouraging word.'

Dickey's Barbecue Restaurants Inc. has said the customer's injuries were an isolated incident.  

Jan Harding, 67, is listed in good condition at a Salt Lake City hospital as she continues to improve, said University of Utah Health Care spokeswoman Kathy Wilets.

The mother-of-three suffered deep burns in her upper esophagus and was in critical condition for a week after taking a single sip of the tea that contained an industrial cleaning solution.

She has been steadily improving this week and can now breathe on her own and talk a bit, family attorney Paxton Guyton has said.

Authorities say a worker at Dickey’s Barbecue in South Jordan unintentionally put the chemical cleaning compound in a sugar bag last month. The substance ended up in Harding’s glass of iced tea after an employee mixed it into a beverage dispenser.

The police agency looking into the incident has finished its investigation. Rather than making arrests and recommending charges, South Jordan police have asked prosecutors to determine if anyone should be charged because several people possibly played a role. 

Salt Lake County District Attorney Sim Gill said it will likely take several more days to review evidence and interviews and make a decision.

The Hardings, who live in the Salt Lake City suburb of Sandy, went to the restaurant after church to meet friends for lunch. They had not even ordered yet when she took a sip of the tea.

The cleaning product in the drink was meant for degreasing deep fryers and contained the odorless chemical lye, the active ingredient in drain cleaners.

Overall, this Dickey’s has maintained a better-than-average health rating since opening in 2012, said Salt Lake County Health Department spokesman Nicholas Rupp this week.

County officials issued seven violations following a January inspection, including for improper food labeling, county records show. The year before, the restaurant had six violations.

Dickey’s Barbecue Restaurants Inc. issued a statement last week that it was an isolated incident and nothing like it had happened in the 73 years the Dallas-based chain has operated.

Consequences: Prosecutors are currently deciding whether to bring up charges against the Utah restaurant for poisoning the customer
