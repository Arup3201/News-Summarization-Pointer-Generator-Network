Billions of stars in our galaxy have between one and three planets which could potentially support life.

Astronomers came to the conclusion after calculating the chances of planets orbiting in the 'Goldilocks zone'.

This is the belt around a star where temperatures are ideal for liquid water to pool on a planet's surface, and for alien life to exist. 

The illustration shows the habitable zone for different types of stars.  The green area is the habitable zone (HZ), where liquid water can exist on a planet’s surface. The red area is too hot for liquid water on the planetary surface and the blue area is too cold for liquid water on the planetary surface

'According to the statistics and the indications we have, a good share of the planets in the habitable zone will be solid planets where there might be liquid water and where life could exist,' said Steffen Kjaer Jacobsen, from the University of Copenhagen.

The findings are based on data from the American space agency Nasa's Kepler space telescope, which has confirmed the existence of around 1,000 planets orbiting stars in the Milky Way.

It has also identified an estimated 3,000 other candidate worlds.

Many of the stars have solar systems of two to six planets, but scientists believe there could be more that remain undiscovered by Kepler, which is best suited to finding large planets in relatively close orbits.

To estimate the positions of the 'hidden' planets, the researchers updated a 250-year-old mathematical concept called the Titius-Bode law.

Pictured are exoplanetary systems where the previously known planets are marked with blue dots, while the red dots show the planets predicted by the Titius-Bode law on the composition of planetary systems. 124 planetary systems in the survey – based on data from the Kepler satellite, fit with this formula

The law, which inferred the existence of Uranus before it was seen, states that there is a certain ratio between the orbital periods of planets in a solar system.

The Titius-Bode law was formulated around 1770 and correctly calculated the position of Uranus before it was even discovered. 

The law states that there is a certain ratio between the orbital periods of planets in a solar system. 

So the ratio between the orbital period of the first and second planet is the same as the ratio between the second and the third planet and so on. 

This means if you know how long it takes for some of the planets to orbit around a star, you can calculate how long it takes for the other planets to orbit and can calculate their position in the planetary system. 

You can also calculate if a planet is 'missing' in the sequence.

Because of this, if you know how long it takes some planets to circle a star, you can work out the time taken for other planets to orbit and fix their positions in the planetary system.

You can also calculate if a planet is missing in the sequence.

'We decided to use this method to calculate the potential planetary positions in 151 planetary systems, where the Kepler satellite had found between three and six planets,' said Mr Jacobsen.

'In 124 of the planetary systems, the Titius-Bode law fit with the position of the planets.

'Using T-B's law we tried to predict where there could be more planets further out in the planetary systems.

'But we only made calculations for planets where there is a good chance that you can see them with the Kepler satellite.'

In this way, the scientists predicted a total of 228 planets in the 151 systems and concluded that each system should have an average of one to three planets in the habitable zone.

Extrapolating further, this suggested that there could be billions of stars in the Milky Way with habitable zone planets where surface water and life could exist.

The scientists, whose findings appear in the journal Monthly Notices of the Royal Astronomical Society, have made a shortlist of 77 'hidden' planets.

They say these planets have a good chance of being spotted as they pass in front of their parent stars

Light curves of the some of the planets orbiting the star Kepler-62. The dip in the light curve occurs when the planet moves in front of the host star, thereby dimming the light of the star. The dip in the light curve is proportional to the size of the planet.

The Kepler satellite observes exoplanets by measuring the light curve of a star. When a planet moves in front of the star there is a small dip in brightness. If this little dip in brightness occurs regularly, there might be a planet orbiting the star and obscuring its light

Extending equation to the entire Milky Way means there are more habitable worlds in existence than previously believed
