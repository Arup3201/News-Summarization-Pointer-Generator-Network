A sheet of blotting paper used to dry the Royal signatures on the document confirming the abdication of King Edward VIII has come to light after 78 years.

The 'Instrument of Abdication' was signed by the outgoing playboy monarch and his three brothers who were witnesses to the historic moment.

They were Albert, who immediately became King George VI, Henry, the Duke of Gloucester, and George, the Duke of Kent.

Royal history: A sheet of blotting paper used to dry the Royal signatures on the document confirming the abdication of King Edward VIII has come to light after 78 years

Blot of history: The Instrument of Abdication was signed by Edward along with his three brothers who were witnesses to the historic moment. They were Albert, who became King George VI, Henry, the Duke of Gloucester and George, the Duke of Kent

Seven identical documents were signed by the brothers at Windsor Castle and for each one a layer of pink blotting paper was placed over the top to dry the fountain pen ink.

There would have been seven pieces of blotting paper but only one has survived and that was kept by Edward who later gave it to a foreign diplomat as a memento.

The pink slip of paper has been looked after and handed down through the anonymous diplomat's family.

It has now emerged for sale at auction at Sothebys with a pre-sale estimate of Â£5,000.

The four signatures absorbed by the thick sheet are back-to-front from where it mirrored the original document.

The auctioneers have used Photoshop software to create an image showing the pink paper flipped and the signatures the right way round, although this is only for demonstration purposes.

Scandal: King Edward VIII, pictured here, caused controversy when he gave up his titel to marry Wallis Simpson

King Edward VIII caused a huge constitutional crisis in 1936 when he decided to give up the throne in order to marry American socialite Wallis Simpson.

His brother Albert, who was next in line, succeeded him and chose the regal name King George VI.

Dr Gabriel Heaton, of auctioneers Sothebys, said: 'This blotting paper is a relic of one of the most important moments in Royal history.

'It is from the time when Edward VIII sat down at a desk in the drawing room of Windsor Castle with his brothers to sign the Instrument of Abdication.

'It was the first time in modern history a monarch had abdicated and there weren't any procedures for it to go by.

'I imagine lawyers and consitutional experts recommended that all four brothers signed the document.

'The blotting paper was quite thick because it was absorbent. It would have been placed over the signed document to dry the ink and make sure it didn't smudge.'

In his memoirs, called A King's Story that was published in 1951, Edward wrote: 'By breakfast the next morning the official copies of the Instrument of Abdication, locked up in my familiar red despatch box, were already on my desk.

'My three brothers arrived...we assembled immediately in the octagonal drawing room.

'Sitting at the desk with my three brothers watching, I began to sign the documents. It was all quite informal. The room was filled with a dignified dull murmur.

'When I had signed the last document I yielded the chair to my brothers who in turn appended their signatures as witnesses in their order of precedence.'

Dr Heaton said the seven copies of the Instrument of Abdication are held in the National Archives but this is the only sheet of blotting paper known to exist.

He said: 'Edward kept the blotting paper as a memento and shortly afterwards gave it to a friend and it has been in their family ever since.

'It is in excellent condition. It has never been exhibited before. It is such a unique item that it is very difficult to value.'The auction takes place in London on July 15
