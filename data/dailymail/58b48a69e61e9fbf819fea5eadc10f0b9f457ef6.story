Dreams of another Investec Derby winner being trained at historic Kingsclere stables will live on through the dark winter months after Andrew Balding-trained Elm Park conclusively landed the Racing Post Trophy at Doncaster.

The historic Hampshire yard was once the base for John Porter, the legendary trainer who landed the Epsom Classic six times during the 1800s.

It was also there that Mill Reef was prepared for his successful assault on Flat racing’s most important race by Balding’s father Ian and a statue of the 1971 Derby hero stands proudly in the stable.

With Andrew in Australia on Saturday, where he saddled Side Glance to finish fourth in the Cox Plate, it was appropriate that Ian accompanied daughter-in-law Anna Lisa to Doncaster to cheer home a horse bred by his wife Emma.

In an additional link to Mill Reef, in his first three races and until purchased by Qatari Sheik Fahad Al Thani, Elm Park had even carried the same distinctive black and gold silks that once represented the great horse’s late owner Paul Mellon but now are the livery of the Kingsclere Racing Club.

An emotional Balding said: ‘We have had five generations of this family and to have bred him is special. Elm Park has the right temperament which is so important. You need that and Mill Reef had it in spades.’

With four Racing Post Trophy winners this century going on to the Derby, the most recent being Camelot in 2011, the race has developed into an important pointer to the Classic

The succinct post-race verdict of BHA two-year-old handicapper Matthew Tester that Elm Park was a ‘good winner of a disappointing race’ looked an accurate assessment keeping the result in perspective.

But it is hard not to be very taken with the son of Phoenix Reach, who surprisingly providing Balding with his first British Group One winner since Casual Look won the 2003 Oaks in his first season at the Kingclere helm.

Elm Park will have high hopes of landing the Investec Derby in the new year

 Atzeni claimed his second win in the race in successive years after winning the 2013 edition on Kingston Hill

Coral cut Elm Park’s Derby odds to 14-1 after he secured the last Group One of the domestic Flat season by two and three quarter lengths from Aidan O’Brien’s Aloft. Sir Mark Prescott’s Celestial Path was a further half-length back in third.

If the success meant a lot to the Baldings, it was also special to jockey Andrea Atzeni who had landed the race 12 months earlier with subsequent St Leger winner Kingston Hill.

Atzeni was only signed up at the new No 1 jockey for Sheik Fahad’s Qatar Racing organisation in August after the surprise announcement that Jamie Spencer was retiring and to post a top-level success so early in their association is an early down dividend on the faith put in him.

O’Brien may have lost out at Doncaster but gained more than adequate compensation when his three-year-old Adelaide won the Cox Plate in Australia under a trademark power-packed Ryan Moore ride.
