Arsene Wenger defended his record as Arsenal manager by reminding supporters that he has managed in 180 Champions League games since he has been at the club.

Wenger brought the issue up himself on Friday morning when he was asked about the club’s dreadful defensive record this season.

‘Since I arrived we have played over 180 Champions League games. You will see that before then they didn’t play so many'. Wenger was slightly off the mark with his estimation, however. The Gunners boss has actually overseen 173 Champions League matches during his tenure.

Arsene Wenger has overseen 173 Champions League games during his time in charge of Arsenal. So, how many European matches have the other big English clubs played since the Frenchman's appointment in September 1996? 

Man Utd (192)

Arsenal (159 + 14 qualifying)

Chelsea (138)

Liverpool (88)

Man City (26)

Tottenham (10)

‘We don’t complain, we want to play top-level games and over the years we have learned to cope.

‘We are a united team for one target and that is to do well for the club we love.

‘I am thankful for compliments, but I don't want anything other than to do well in the job. That’s what I always try to do.’

Wenger also complained about the lack of training sessions he has been able to take between matches because of Arsenal’s schedule this season.

Arsenal played eight games - including the qualifying game - and finished second in the group behind Borussia Dortmund.

Wenger added: ‘We came back at 5am on Wednesday and we have just recovered, there are no sessions.

‘We played eight Champions League games, we are exposed to the demands physically. We are working less than we want.

‘We defended well against Galatasaray. The last game is the one that is always judged. We didn’t defend well at Stoke but at Galatasaray we defended well.’

Aaron Ramsey, who scored a brilliant goal against Galatasary in Istanbul, is out of Saturday’s clash with Newcastle at the Emirates.

Wenger added: ‘We got the scan last night on Ramsey, I don’t know enough about the injury. He was getting close to last season’s form.

‘It was a great goal, an unexpected one and even he was surprised it went so well. He has good finishing technique.’

‘It (this job) is a permanent tribunal.

‘I have sympathy for every manager who suffers. Pardew did extremely well until December when he lost (Yohan) Cabaye - this year he had a difficult start.'
