Esther Rantzen has passed emails containing sex allegations against three ‘high-profile’ BBC employees to the police.

The messages were sent  to Ms Rantzen by people who saw her appearance on the recent ITV documentary exposing Savile as a predatory paedophile.

All three are still alive.

Ms Rantzen, the founder of the charity ChildLine, said she passed the ‘general allegations’ – which were not made by  the victims but by others with knowledge of the incidents – to detectives on the Savile probe.

But she decided not to warn the BBC. ‘I didn’t think it was my responsibility to tell the BBC,’ she told The Mail on Sunday yesterday.

Earlier this month, Ms Rantzen was forced to  deny reports that she ignored warnings about Savile 18 years ago.

Esther Rantzen said BBC staff had witnessed Savile's promiscuity

She said yesterday that she had heard a ‘rumour’ about Savile’s interest in young girls when she started work at the Corporation, but had never met ‘anyone who had either witnessed it or experienced it’.

However, she said BBC staff had witnessed his promiscuity.

Ms Rantzen said a friend of hers who worked on the Radio 1 programme Savile’s Travels told her the presenter had left his radio microphone on while having sex with a nurse during  a visit to a hospital.

‘My friend’s job was to  sit through the spools of recordings.

One of the things he had to listen to was Jimmy having sex in some sort of hospital cupboard with a nurse. It was consensual sex, but my friend was pretty disgusted.’

Ms Rantzen insisted ChildLine had never received any calls naming Savile as an abuser. 

She spoke as it emerged that police have identified three former close associates of Savile crucial to their inquiry and who are expected to be questioned soon.

One of them, a convicted sex offender, was a friend of the Top Of The Pops presenter in the early days of his career.

The other two were BBC employees in the Seventies. None is a household name.

Detectives are preparing an ‘arrest strategy’ after being contacted by more than 300 alleged victims.
