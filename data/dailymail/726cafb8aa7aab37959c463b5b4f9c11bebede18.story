A video has emerged appearing to show an Afghan soldier risking his life by allowing a marksman to shoot tins from his shoulders - from 50 metres away.

Footage, believed to have been taken at a base in Afghanistan, shows a special forces soldier standing still as a sniper picks off the small targets.

The video starts by showing a fully-equipped marksman lying on the ground, positioning his weapon and taking aim.

It then cuts away to an armed man with green tins positioned on his shoulders.

He is standing next to another soldier, with a third man filming proceedings with a mobile phone. They are all standing in front of a wall at the unnamed base.

Seconds later the screen becomes blurred as one of the tins is apparently shot by the sniper - to cheers from  colleagues.

The man remains perfectly still and  even appears to smile after the second tin is blasted away from his left shoulder.

The footage is believed to have been taken at a military base in Afghanistan. But the identity of the men is unknown

The camera then pans back to the sniper who stands up as the other men congratulate him.

According to 9News the weapon shown in the video is a US-made M4 Carbine with an attached scope.

Before the video ends, the marksman walks up to shake hands with the soldier . 

The identity of the men is not yet known and 9News reports that it is unclear if those involved will face disciplinary action for the stunt.
