This the gaping hole left in a Chinese street after three shops collapsed in on themselves yesterday afternoon.

The buildings disappeared into the ground at a road junction in downtown Guangzhou, capital of south China's Guangdong Province.

One after another, each structure crumbled in a heap of rubble, leaving a hole 30ft deep in the shopping area.

Debris: Little was left of the multi-storey buildings after their foundations crumbled and they disappeared in a cloud of dust

Shock: Witnesses said several trees fell down before the shops were destroyed at a junction near a metro building site

Incredibly, no one was injured in the accident, which took place near a metro tunnel building site, Xinhua news agency reported.

Construction workers had noticed land sinking near the site at  around 4.40pm and helped to evacuate the area.

A witness identified only as Xu said several trees fell down at about 4.30pm, before a pair of two-storey shop buildings collapsed.

Another building of around five or six stories caved in at 6.30pm, Xu added.

From 8pm onwards, rescuers adopted 
risk-prevention methods by pouring concrete into the hole. Monitoring statistics show there is no further risk and the 
accident site is stable, it said.

Rescuers said at least three buildings were destroyed in the accident in the Liwan district.

Damage limitation: Emergency services poured concrete into the hole to prevent any further problems

Worrying: Metro construction workers avacuated the area after they noticed the ground sinking, in what is the latest in a series of accidents at China's construction sites

Guangzhou Metro Corporation reported what had happened on Sina-Weibo, China's version of Twitter.

The cause of the incident is being investigated.

It is the latest in a string of problems for China's construction industry as the country's economy develops at great speed.

Six major bridges have collapsed across the country since July last year.

In September, 19 construction workers in the centre of the country were killed after a lift plummeted 30 floors, while a man walking through a building site in the east narrowly escaped death when a metal bar went through his head.

A month earlier, an explosion in a Chinese coal mine killed 26 miners and left others trapped in the carbon monoxide-filled pit for a day.
