Do not read pornography in public and do not slurp your food is just some of hilarious advice offered in a new guide book on dating Western women for Japanese men.

Love With A Western Woman claims Japanese men have average or smaller than average-sized penises, but stresses 90 per cent of Western women think size does not matter.

It adds some women do not like 'bigger penises' because it can make 'sex painful', and advises men against calling their friends after intercourse to brag about having sex with a foriegn woman.

Smooth operators: Love With A Western Women provides hilarious advice for Japanese men

The book highlights that in western culture it is 'very rare' for a child to share a bed with their parents and explains it can make the 'practicalities of when and where to have sex difficult'.

It continues that many western women are willing to follow the Japanese tradition of sleeping together as a family.

But it says this means men must be more creative about having sex instead of 'using sleeping arrangements as an excuse not to have it'. It adds: 'You have love hotels! Use them!'

The author adds:  'Now come on boys, don't you all want to put some big smiles on the faces of your Western sweethearts?!'

It is also cautions that 'fantastic sex is nothing like Japanese porn' because most women 'want or will be fulfilled', and suggests that men stop watching it.

An extract published in the Japan Times added: 'We don’t like it when you read porn in public (and most of us aren’t really comfortable with you reading it in private either).

'This goes hand-in-hand with the whole concept of hostess bars, soaplands, and prostitution, which are completely distasteful to most of us.'

Hardworking: The book warns Japanese men to balance their relationship with their job

The bizarre book is written by British author Caroline Pover, who divides her time between the UK and Japan.

She has also penned a guide for western women living in Japan, which includes advice on everything from dating and 'organising contraception' to avoiding 'hair disasters' and finding clothes that fit.

Love With A Western Woman explains that slurping food can drive a woman 'mad' and suggests men do not compare their build to the 'generally bigger' size of Western women.

It also lists Japanese men who Western women 'love', including actor Kenichi Matsuyama and singer Takeshi Kaneshiro, and says men must strike the right balance between their relationship and work hard.

Ms Pover warned against looking too feminine, with 'handbags and pointy shoes', which may cause Western women to think they are gay.

It adds men should be confident, relaxed and respectful. They should treat women as equals, not order their food for them on a date and look at their eyes, not their breasts, the books says.

A quote from an interviewee adds: 'You will get an independent woman who will need her 'me time,' girls' nights, and help with the house chores.

'My husband loves to jokingly tease me about how ‘a Japanese wife would never do that’ on a lot of things. So just know that you are signing up for something a little different.'
