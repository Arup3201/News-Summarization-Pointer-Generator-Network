Some of the seven hostages believed to have been killed by militant Islamists in Nigeria might still be alive, the country’s president said yesterday.

Goodluck Jonathan added that his government has been working to rescue any survivors among the foreign construction workers kidnapped in February.

Islamist group Ansaru said earlier this month that it had killed the seven. Italy and Greece confirmed that a Briton, an Italian, a Greek and four Lebanese abducted in northern Nigeria’s Bauchi state had been killed by their captors.

Britain said only that it was likely they had been killed, whereas Nigerian authorities had so far not commented.

But Mr Jonathan said yesterday: 
‘Analysis of the information we have does not give us the conclusive 
position that they have all been killed, but we suspect that some 
probably might have died of health-related causes or direct killing.

‘We have been working hard with 
friendly nations, especially the United Kingdom, to see that they are 
rescued. We suspect that they are in a rocky area, a very difficult area
that cannot be easily accessed, but we are working hard to get to 
them.’

Explosions killed 25 people yesterday
in the Nigerian city of Kano, where Islamists are waging an insurgency 
against the government.

Britain said only that it was likely they had been killed, whereas Nigerian authorities had so far not commented.

A Mail Online source said Mr Jonathan's comments should be 'treated with caution'.

In response to the claims that arose this afternoon the Foreign Office said it was looking into the reports.

A Foreign Office spokesman said: 'As the Foreign Secretary said on 10 March, we believe that the British construction worker, Brendan Vaughan, was likely to have been killed in Nigeria by his captors along with six other foreign nationals who were taken hostage at the same time. 

'We are continuing to work with the Nigerian authorities to establish exactly what happened and to support them in their efforts to bring the perpetrators of this terrible crime to justice.'

The kidnappings highlighted the growing risk posed by violent Islamist groups in Nigeria to Western interests.

Western governments fear ties with 
groups elsewhere in the region are drawing Nigerian Islamists towards a 
more explicitly anti-Western agenda, like that of al Qaeda's north 
African wing, especially since France launched an operation to flush 
them out of northern Mali in January.

Allegations: President Goodluck Jonathan made the comments today during a visit by Lebanon's President Michel Suleiman

Mr Hague condemned the likely killing
as 'cold-blooded murder' and said he would work with the Nigerian 
government to bring those behind the attack to account.

No further details about Mr Vaughan 
have been released but tributes have begun to be posted on Facebook by 
friends of construction worker Brendan Vaughan.

One of Mr Vaughan's friends - Peter Dixon - left a message on the site saying 'Rip mate'.

Mr Vaughan's Thai girlfriend, Orasa Arpornkaew, wrote: 'You're always in my heart.'

Dom Cooney posted: 'Can't believe it. he was like an ox.'

Mr Vaughan's page includes details of where he was working in Nigeria and photos of armed protection guards at his compound.

It appears he had left West Yorkshire and started a new life in Thailand with Ms Arpornkaew.

Foreign Secretary William Hague called Mr Vaughan's murder. He also vowed to work with the Nigerian government to bring the killers to justice

Earlier this month Mr Hague said in a
statement: 'This was an act of cold-blooded murder, which I condemn in 
the strongest terms.

'My thoughts are with his family, and the families of the other hostages, who will be devastated by this tragic loss.

'I offer them our deep condolences at
this terrible time, and know that the thoughts of people up and down 
our country will be with them.'

He added: 'Responsibility for this 
tragic outcome rests squarely with the terrorists. I am grateful to the 
Nigerian government for their unstinting help and co-operation.

'We are utterly determined to work 
with them to hold the perpetrators of this heinous act to account, and 
to combat the terrorism which so blights the lives of people in northern
Nigeria and in the wider region.'

Those kidnapped included three 
Lebanese citizens and one each from Britain, Greece, Italy and the 
Philippines - all employees of Setraco, a Lebanese construction company 
with an operation in Bauchi state, local officials said at the time.

A message from Ansaru, the extremist 
group behind the February 16 kidnappings, said that the 
hostages were killed after British warplanes were reported to have been 
seen in the northern Nigerian city of Bauchi by local journalists.

In a statement, the group said: 'As a result of this operation, the seven hostages were killed.'

Ansaru said a video of the killings 
would be posted online. An online image accompanying the posting 
appeared to show a gunman standing over bodies.

Local media: A report, published by Leadership Weekend, claimed that five British 'jet bombers' were spotted at Nnamdi Azikiwe International Airport in Abuja

Ansaru cited two local media reports claiming 
that British planes had arrived in Nigeria to assist a rescue operation 
for the terrorists but the MoD categorically denied that British troops 
were involved in a rescue

They claimed a message from Nigerian 
President Goodluck Jonathan which said the government would do anything 
in its power to free the hostages also sparked the decision to kill the 
hostages.

Ansaru previously issued a short 
statement in which it said its fighters kidnapped the foreigners on 
February 16 from a construction company's camp at Jama'are, a town about
125 miles (201km) north of Bauchi, the capital of Bauchi state.

The attack saw gunmen first assault a local prison and burn police trucks, authorities said.

Then the attackers blew up a back fence at the construction company's 
compound and took over, killing a guard in the process, witnesses and 
police said.

The gunmen appeared to be organised 
and knew who they wanted to target, leaving the Nigerian staff unharmed,
while the foreigners were quickly abducted, a witness said.

In January 2012, Ansaru declared 
itself a splinter group independent from Boko Haram, the north's main 
terrorist group, analysts say.

Boko Haram, whose name means 'Western
education is sacrilege', has launched a guerrilla campaign of bombings 
and shootings across Nigeria's predominantly Muslim north.

Boko Haram has been blamed for at least 792 killings last year alone, according to a recent estimate.

It is not the first time hostages have been killed in Nigeria.

British national Chris McManus and 
Italian co-worker Franco Lamolinara died in a failed rescue bid in March
last year as Nigerian troops and UK Special Boat Service commandos 
tried to end their nine months in captivity.
