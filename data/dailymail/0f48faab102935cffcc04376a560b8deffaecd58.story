Sons and daughters grow up but they'll always be a baby to their devoted mothers. It's a touching sentiment but it can also cause friction between families when mothers can't let go of their beloved sons - particularly after they get married. 

It's a situation that Mel Fallowfield, a journalist who lives in London, knows only too well. She says her relationship with her mother-in-law, Irene Atterbury, is 'strained' because she frowns upon the way Mel 'looks after' her son, Brian.

Appearing on today's This Morning, mother-of-two Mel, 41, explained: 'Irene is quite traditional so when she arrives and I'm working, she'll ask "what's for supper" and I'll say "I don't know, there might be some eggs in the fridge" or she'll see a pile of Brian's un-ironed shirts. She feels I don't look after him as well as I might.'

Conflict: Mel Fallowfield, right, appeared on today's This Morning with her mother-in-law Irene Atterbury

Irene believes Mel should be acting like a perfect housewife, keeping the home clean for her son and having his dinner on the table when he comes home from his job as the head of client strategy for an IT company. But Mel thinks it's better if she also earns money.

Mel said: 'I can understand she wants her son to be "properly looked after" but I think me bringing money into the family is more important that cleaning the skirting boards.'

Irene admitted her and Mel's differing views stem from them coming from different generations - and possibly because she's from the North while her daughter-in-law is a Southerner.

She confessed that she can be 'a bit outspoken' when telling Mel if she doesn't agree with the way she's doing things - from the care of her son and grandchildren to the housework.

She can also be tactless at times, for example, asking Mel is she could wear black to her wedding to Brian and once even commenting on her daughter-in-law's figure.

Generations apart: The pair have different views on a woman's role as a wife 

Mel recalled: 'I put on weight with a thyroid problem and she said "goodness you have put on weight haven't you?" When I asked Brian to tell her not to comment about it, she said to me later, "you're sensitive about your weight".'

Irene said she thinks it's better to voice her opinion - even if it causes offence - as she believes 'if you bottle it up, it gets worse.'

She admitted wanting to wear black to her son's wedding could have been because 'deep down' she was mourning losing him to his wife. 

Mel said her husband doesn't get involved to resolve the differences between her and his mother.

'Brian has got fed up, he thinks "you're too grown up women, sort it out",' she said. 

Commenting on the situation this This Morning, relationship expert Dr Pam Spurr said tension between a mother-in-law and daughter-in-law can be a 'serious issue' that needs to be resolved as it can cause the break up of a relationship.

She said: 'Interfering mother-in-laws need to stand back and realise they sound like that Harry Enfield character who no-one liked who always said "you don't want to do that!"'

The tricky relationship between wives and their husband's mother is one writer Katy Rink, from Shrewsbury, also knows well.

She has written a book on the subject, 'Managing Your MIL: You and your mother-in-law, for better or for worse?'

She previously told MailOnline that it's important for women at war to remember that they both have the same goal in mind - their husband/son's happiness. 

She told MailOnline of the mother-in-law-daughter-in-law dynamic: 'It's an important relationship and one you might have to put a lot of energy into getting right.

'It's one where both are programmed to be mutually suspicious of the other. She wants you to be up to the job of looking after your son and you feel under pressure and sometimes insecure as you adapt to a new role as a wife and mother.'  

For daughters-in-law like Mel feeling the strain, she has the following advice: 'Remember you can't change your mother-in-law but you can change the way you react. Don't prickle too readily or look for hidden messages.'
