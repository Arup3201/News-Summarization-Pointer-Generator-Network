Having beaten testicular cancer earlier in November, Jonas Gutierrez has marked overcoming the disease by having a tattoo inked onto his arm.

The Newcastle winger was  discharged from hospital, having revealed two months previously that he had been battling testicular cancer for a full year.

And with the Argentine poised for a sensational return back to St James' Park, the 31-year-old has decided to have a tattoo featuring lyrics from an Eminem song.

The words 'I'm alive again. More alive than I had been in my whole entire life. 03-11-14' are inked onto Gutierrez's arm and come from the rapper's 2010 track 'No Love'.

Gutierrez first discovered he had the disease after being assessed following a challenge from Bacary Sagna in the Toon's Premier League clash with Arsenal in April last year.

But Pardew is now ready to welcome back the popular Argentine to his squad.

‘We had a response from his surgeon to say that in about a month's time he can cope with professional training,’ said Pardew.

‘So we are not rushing him in any shape or form, just letting Jonas have some time because it's such an illness that you do need a lot of recovery time for that.

‘But he's in great shape. Colo (Fabricio Coloccini) tells me he is in good form and we are looking forward to seeing him.

‘It's massive news for the squad because he is a much-loved figure here.’

Gutierrez had a testicle removed in October of last year. However, he has been receiving chemotherapy since the summer after a check-up revealed inflammation in his groin.

But the popular winger is now free to resume training with the Magpies having not featured since last October in black and white.
