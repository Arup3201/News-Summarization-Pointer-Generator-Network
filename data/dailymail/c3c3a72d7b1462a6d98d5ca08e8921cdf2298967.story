A man who complained he didn't get a fair trial because the judge presiding over the case kept falling asleep, will get the chance to appeal his lengthy jail sentence for brutally bashing a man more than a decade ago.

The family of Paul Duncan, who was sentenced to 16 years for permanently disabling a man during a brawl in Wollongong on the NSW south coast, has won a successful appeal claiming that District Court Judge Ian Dodd was 'constantly dozing off' during parts of his 2003 trial.

Duncan's family have spent years during his incarceration trying to get a successful appeal, which was last week granted by NSW Supreme Court Justice Richard Button.

After years of unsuccessful attempts,  prisoner Paul Duncan has been been granted an appeal for his 2003 sentencing

Justice Button referred his case to the Criminal Court of Criminal Appeal on the grounds that Duncan feels he experienced a 'sense of unease' about how his trial was originally handled by Mr Dodd, who the family said was asleep during important proceedings of his trial.

The Daily Telegraph reported on Sunday that Duncan's family accused the judge of having 'his hands clasped together and his head dropped down' during the trial which led to his lengthy jail term.

Duncan's mother, Linda Machman, said she also heard Dodd snoring in evidence she provided to the NSW Supreme Court. The case will now be heard in the NSW Court of Criminal Appeal on July 17.

It is not the first time that Judge Dodd has been accused of falling asleep during trials he has presided over, which have led to a conviction.Â

In 2008 the High Court ordered a retrial of two men, accused of drug smuggling, after it found Judge Dodd suffered from sleep apnoea and had fallen asleep during the pair's trial.

It was reported at the time court officials and lawyers sometimes loudly dropped documents in a bid to wake the snoring judge, and the two accused, Rafael Cesan and Ruben Rivadavia claimed they could not have had a fair hearing because he dozed off so often.

In his appeal evidence, accused drug smuggler Rafael Cesan said the judge's snoring was disruptive when he was being cross-examined.

The High Court agreed that Judge Dodd did not exercise supervision of the trial as required by law and, as a result, the jury was distracted.

'Where the judge is noticeably and repeatedly asleep or inattentive during the trial, there can be a miscarriage of justice,' said Chief Justice Robert French.

'The trial in this case was so flawed. There was a miscarriage of justice. It could not be said that the miscarriage was not substantial.

'It was revealed after the men's trial that Judge Dodd suffered from sleep apnoea, a condition which brings on pauses in breathing during the night, the disturbed sleep resulting in daytime tiredness and fatigue.

It resulted in a miscarriage of justice, but during a retrial in the District Court the two men were found guilty.

Paul Duncan will have his appeal heard in the NSW Court of Criminal Appeal on July 17.
