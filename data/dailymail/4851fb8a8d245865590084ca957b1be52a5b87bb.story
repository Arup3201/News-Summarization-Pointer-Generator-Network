Manchester United’s sense of injustice over Wayne Rooney’s red card has been heightened by their view Luke Shaw was the victim of a headbutt from West Ham’s Diafra Sakho.

Manager Louis van Gaal made the peculiar claim on Saturday night that Rooney’s foul on Stewart Downing was no worse than some committed by their opponents. However, it was an alleged incident between Shaw and Sakho that most infuriated United as the full back, 19, was left with a black eye.

Last night the FA had no record of a complaint and they will find out today if there is anything in referee Lee Mason’s report.

Shaw was also critical of the decision to send off Rooney.

‘We have had a lot of bad luck, especially with Wazza’s red card, as there was a handball but the referee didn’t stop play,’ said Shaw.

‘And earlier in the game, Sakho did the same to me.’
