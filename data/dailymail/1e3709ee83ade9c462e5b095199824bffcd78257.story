Hundreds of women breastfed on the street in support of a woman who was branded a 'tramp' for feeding her baby in public.

Emily Slough, 27, was photographed on the steps of a restaurant last Friday feeding her eight-month-old Matilda.

The anonymous photographer posted the image on Facebook, writing: 'I know the sun is out n all that but there's no need to let your kid feast on your nipple in town!!! Tramp.'

Protest: Between 600 and 1,000 women turned out in Rugeley, Staffordshire, to breastfeed today

Today, women across the country gathered in town centres to campaign for the right to breastfeed in public.

One protest, organised by Mrs Slough in Rugeley, Staffordshire, featured between 600 and 1,000 demonstrators who crowded around The Shrew pub - where she was spotted last week.

In Newcastle, more than 50 mothers sat on the pavement with their infant children, discussing the issue with passers-by.

Janet Murphy, 32, who co-organised the Newcastle gathering, said: 'This woman was labelled a tramp on a social networking site and we're here to try and make everyone aware that it's ok, normal and natural for a woman to breast feed wherever she wishes to.

'If someone criticized me, I'd tell them 
it's acceptable to do it in public. Animals do it. Breasts aren't a 
sexual thing they're for feeding your child.'

Julia Langley added: 'I think I'd be absolutely gutted if someone did that to me, I mean this photo was taken without her consent, she didn't know it had been taken.

'I think that things like this can really put off new mums who are thinking of how they're going to feed their baby if they get treated like this for breast feeding in public, it might sway their decision towards bottle feeding instead.'

Treasure Chest, York's leading breastfeeding support group, also came out in support of the protests.

Katherine Odom, Chair of the group said: 'Many mums can feel that breastfeeding their child in public is a barrier for them and we hope this lone incident doesn't put mums or prospective mums off breastfeeding when there are so many benefits for both mum and baby.

In Newcastle, more than 50 mothers got on their knees to block the town centre while breastfeeding

Support: They were supported by breastfeeding support group Treasure Chest, whose chair said mothers feel under-pressure and embarrassed to carry out everyday essential duties

One mother, Julia Langley, said the 'taboo' of breastfeeding could push women into less natural bottle feeding

'There are many organisations like Treasure Chest, who can support women in their breastfeeding goals. Breastfeeding in public without harassment is a right every woman should have - in fact it is protected by law in the Equality Act of 2010 - and we can give practical tips and friendly support to help mums overcome any reservations they may have.'

The original picture was posted on the Spotted Rugeley page of the site.

'Spotted In' Facebook pages are springing up in villages, towns and cities all over the UK - but it's not clear who exactly is behind them. Users post anonymously but there is an administrator.

An organiser of the Newcastle event blasted critics who regard exposed breasts for feeding as inappropriate

Mrs Slough, from Rugeley, Staffordshire, said she was 'shocked' when she discovered what had been said about her.

She told the Birmingham Mail: 'The mentality of the individual that attempted to shame me for feeding my daughter makes me so angry.

'I am very confident and comfortable with my breastfeeding, but I know plenty who aren't and don't even humour the idea of nursing because of some ridiculous stigma attached to it and fear of embarrassment, humiliation and non-acceptance.'
