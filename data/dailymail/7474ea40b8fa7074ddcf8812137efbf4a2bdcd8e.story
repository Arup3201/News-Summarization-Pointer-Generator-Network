Lavish lifestyle: Bruce Wasserstein, who passed away in 2009 aged 61, left behind a complicated personal life and billion-dollar fortune

The mistress of late billionaire Bruce Wasserstein is fighting to get their love child equal access to his luxury Hamptons mansion, court documents revealed.

Erin McCarthy launched the legal bid on behalf of her five-year-old daughter Sky in April 2012.

Miss McCarthy wants Sky to have the same access as her ex-lover's other five children to the beachfront home, which Wasserstein family life has revolved around for 20 years, according to DNAInfo.

Miss McCarthy's request has not yet been decided upon by the court after it was deferred, her lawyer said today.

The sprawling mansion has been a bone of contention when it comes to settling the investment mogul's vast estate. 

Legal wranglings are ongoing on how to divide Wasserstein's $2.2.billion wealth among a complex cast of family including a widow, three ex-wives, a mistress and six children.

Miss McCarthy had claimed that her five-year-old daughter Sky would find the stays at the custom-built, beachfront property, 'therapeutic' - following advice the mother sought from a child psychologist.

The 26-acre property in East Hampton, a playground for New York City's wealthy and well-connected, is the summer bolthole for Wasserstein's five children from two of his four marriages, who reportedly are unhappy about sharing their home.

Miss McCarthy, first petitioned 
the trustees of Wasserstein's estate, estimated at $2.2billion, for 
access - but her request was denied. She then petitioned the Surrogate's court in Manhattan last year.  

The estate is managed by some of the late Wassersteins' friends and business associates for all of his six children.

Legal battle: Erin McCarthy, wants her daughter Sky, to have the same rights as Bruce Wasserstein's other children from marriage

Expectant: Miss McCarthy, a business grad at Columbia, became pregnant during an affair with the investment banking mogul while he was still married to his third wife Claude

Miss McCarthy, a 41-year-old Columbia business school graduate, originally from 
Burlington, Kentucky, went to Surrogate's court in Manhattan to fight for her daughter's 
rights.

The mother claims her daughter should be treated the same as Wasserstein's five other 
children - ranging in age from teens to thirties.

According to court documents, the other five children - two daughters and three sons - then offered their half-sister, either properties in California or Paris if she gave up rights to the Hamptons home. However the offer failed, DNAinfo reported.

Trustees'
for the Wasserstein estate offered a solution: Sky Wasserstein would 
receive one-fifth of the market value of the Hamptons' property, along 
with homes in Santa Barbara and Paris, while the other siblings would 
continue to own the homes, a court-appointed lawyer for Sky Wasserstein told MailOnline.

Eric
Prenzer, a lawyer appointed by the Surrogate's Court for Sky 
Wasserstein, told MailOnline that he filed a report saying that the trustees' 
proposal was in the little girl's best interest.

David Stoll, a lawyer for Wasserstein's three eldest children, said his client had no comment.

According to court papers, Miss McCarthy's daughter has $75million in a trust and lives in a multimillion-dollar Manhattan apartment paid for by the Wasserstein estate.

There is also tens of thousands of dollars paid out in child support every month.

Bruce Wasserstein died at the age of 61 in October 2009 after a short illness, the details of which are unknown.

The
investment banking mogul had a stellar career on Wall Street where he 
made his name as a corporate raider in the 1980s. He used some of the 
earnings to acquire New York Magazine.

The billions he earned were poured into breath-taking property including a Manhattan duplex penthouse on Fifth Avenue.

There
is also a Santa Barbara ranch in California and Parisian apartment 
along with the vast 26-acre Hamptons estate known as Cranberry Dune 
where wealthy neighbors include Jerry Seinfeld.

The five siblings view Miss McCarthy's daughter as equal for 
inheritance of their father's wealth - but according to DNAInfo, allegedly do not want her, and it appears more importantly her mother, to have access to the Hamptons' residence.

According to the website, they claim the problem lies with Miss McCarthy who they blame for ending their father's marriage to his third wife Claude.

The Wasserstein clan claim Miss McCarthy once broke into the mansion, DNAInfo reported from court records.

Claude Wasserstein added that her two sons were 'terrorized' by Miss McCarthy at the property in 2008, according to affidavits seen by the website.

Miss McCarthy said in court documents at the time that she was suffering from post-partum depression and had been unaware Mr Wasserstein had started a relationship with his soon-to-be fourth wife, who was at the home.

The Hamptons home, located on exclusive Further Lane, sprawls over 14,000 square-feet and has seven bedrooms along with a tennis court and pool, according to the WSJ.

The late mogul's complicated family life includes a widow, three ex-wives and six children - along with his mistress Miss McCarthy.

His eldest child Pamela works as a director at the Tribeca Film Institute, according to Vanity Fair. The two other children from this marriage are Ben, an HBO producer and writer, and Scoop, a law student.

The billionaire also has two teenage sons Jack and Dash with his third wife Claude Becker, a former producer at CBS who he married in 1996. 

At the time of his death, the billionaire had been married to Angela Chao since earlier that year.

He also married Laura Lynelle Killin in 1968 but they divorced six years later without having any children.
