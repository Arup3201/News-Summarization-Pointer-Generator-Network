Britain is facing a double whammy of bad weather with heavy rain and floods expected to be followed by a 90mph storm.

Last night flood alerts were in place on rivers across the country.

Good weather today could give the impression that the storms have gone away – but the respite will be brief, with more rain and gales due from tonight.

Waterlogged: Heavy downpours led to delays on the roads in and around Glasgow. Last night, more than two inches of rain fell on high ground in North Ayrshire, with an inch descending on Glasgow

evening, while Sunday would see squally showers with local hail and 
thunder.

The weather is expected to grow even 
worse on Monday with the arrival of the St Jude storm – named after the 
patron saint of lost causes whose feast day falls that day. Leon Brown, 
meteorologist at the Weather Channel, said the 90mph winds combined with
 more than an inch of rain could bring down trees and cause structural 
damage.

The path of the storm is unclear but it is likely to hit Wales and the South West first before touching most of the country.

The storm is currently 5,000 miles 
away over the Gulf of Mexico and Mr Brown said its predicted impact may 
change as it nears Britain in the next few days.
