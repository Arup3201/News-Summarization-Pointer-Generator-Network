Marcos Rojo is ready to make an impact following his £16million move to Manchester United... on Premier League forwards' shins that is.

The Argentina defender sealed his switch from Sporting Lisbon on Wednesday and will add much-needed steel to United's brittle defence, which was breached twice on the opening day of the season in a miserable defeat against Swansea. 

A quick glance at Rojo's disciplinary statistics from his time in Portugal reveal a player not afraid to get stuck in to the opposition - whether within the rules of the game or outside of them.

Seeing red: Cards are a familiar sight for Rojo

Rojo collected a staggering 15 yellow cards and four red cards during his previous two league seasons with Sporting - more than anyone else in the Portuguese Primeira Liga - marking him out as a man not to be trifled with.

Not only that, Rojo also saw red in the Portuguese cup against Benfica making it five reds in two seasons at Sporting.

The 24-year-old from La Plata also gave a hint of what was to come for Premier League referees when he collected his second yellow card of the World Cup  in the last-16 win over Switzerland.

Rojo took down Ricardo Rodriguez to earn himself a booking which would rule him out of the quarter-final against Belgium.

The left back's absence from that match does not seem to have concerned Louis van Gaal, who was able to scout Rojo first-hand as Holland manger in the semi-final. But if Rojo is suspended for, say, United's visit to Anfield on March 21 then the Dutchman might think differently.

United were forced to field 20-year-old Tyler Blackett at centre half and Ashley Young at left back during the defeat by Swansea, such is the paucity of top-class options available to Van Gaal. Supporters will hope that Rojo's signing will ensure their new boss does not need to expose such a makeshift defence again.

Rojo could be the latest in a long line of Argentine hard men to have left their own stud marks on the game. In recent years Gabriel Heinze was a fans' favourite at Old Trafford, while Javier Mascherano became a fearsome figure in Liverpool's midfield. No England fan will forget Diego Simeone's role in Argentina's midfield at the World Cup in 1998, and the nation's reputation for dirty play was cemented during the vicious World Cup quarter-final defeat by the Three Lions at Wembley in 1966.

Further evidence of Rojo's hot-headedness came when he refused to train at Sporting in a bid to force through his move to United. The message was loud and clear: don't mess with me. 

Premier League strikers take note: this one could be a real Red Devil.
