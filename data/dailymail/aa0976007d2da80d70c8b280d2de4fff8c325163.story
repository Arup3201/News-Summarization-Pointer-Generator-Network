A classic sports car is expected to fetch more than £2.3million to become one of the most expensive Fords ever sold when it goes under the hammer later this month.

The iconic Ford GT40 was built to take on Ferrari in motorsport after Henry Ford famously fell out with Enzo Ferrari.

And this particular 1965 Mark 1 model was the first to be sold in the UK when, in 1966, it was delivered to businessman Jim Fielding in Gloucester.

The sports car, which has also resided in Australia and Germany, is going under the hammer at RM Auctions' Arizona sale in the U.S. next weekend.

RM described the car - which gets its name because it is just 40in high - as 'one of the best road-going GT40s in existence'.

In August last year actor Steve McQueen’s camera car from the racing film Le Mans sold at auction for $11million.

The 1968 powder blue Ford GT40/Mirage Lightweight Racing Car, P/1074, finished in the Gulf team colors, landed the eye-popping final bid at a collector-car show hosted by RM Auctions in Monterey, California.

The auction house called the car the 'star attraction' of their California sale and said a bidding war erupted from among eager buyers. When the winner secured the car with an $11,000,000 final offer, the crowd honored the conquest with a standing ovation.Ford GT40

The previous record holder was a 1931 Duesenberg roadster called the Whittell Coupe, which had a sale price of $10.34 million at a 2010 auction.

And experts anticipate it will fetch upwards of $3million (£2.3million) when it takes centre stage in the high profile sale.

Gord
Duff, a specialist at RM Auctions, said excitement has been building before the sale.

He said: 'The Ford GT40 holds an 
important place in American racing history as the car that gave Enzo a 
run for his money, repeatedly, and remains highly sought after in 
collector circles.

'Exceptionally rare, well documented, and boasting an unblemished history from new, P/1034 is arguably one of the best road-going GT40s in existence.'

The ultra-sleek sports car was powered by a 4.7-litre engine developing 380bhp.

Weighing less than one-tonne, it was capable of a top speed approaching 200mph - an incredible feat back in 1965.

A 1960 Ferrari 250 GT SWB Berlinetta 'Competizione' is also expected to generate a lot of interest at the sale - and could fetch in excess of £4 million.
