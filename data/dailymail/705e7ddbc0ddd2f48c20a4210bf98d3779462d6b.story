A primary school has been forced to cancel its sports day after a group of gipsies invaded their playing fields and refused to leave,

The convoy of around 40 vehicles set up camp on the land next to Elston Hall Primary School in Wolverhampton, West Midlands on Monday.

Attempts to remove the travellers failed and the school was forced to call off a two-day sports day which was supposed to take place yesterday and today.

The greenbelt land is publicly-owned and the school has used it every year for the last ten years to hold their sports day.

A message on the school's website said: 'Due to the problems with Bee Lane field, we are disappointed to have to postpone Key Stage 2 Sports Day and Early Years Foundation Stage.

'We will do our best to rearrange. Sorry for any inconvenience caused, thank you for your understanding.'

Councillor Daniel Warren said the travellers had been given a 
24 hour stay of execution by the Wolverhampton City Council and West 
Midlands Police which expired at 1pm today.

Because the group have moved around different areas of the city over the last few weeks, they have been told immediate action will be taken if they pitch up in the borough again.

Cllr Warren said: 'The school doesn't have a playing field. It's a small piece of greenbelt land.

'They couldn't fit a playing field when they built the school so they used the piece of land next to the school for their sports day.

'West Midlands Police said after that 24 hours is up, that's when they start to take action.'

Mother-of-two Dawn Hedges, 36, said: 'It's a shame really. The children turned up at school looking forward to sports day today and it has been postponed.

'Everyone understands these travellers need to go somewhere but for god's sake leave school playing fields alone.

'They know police are powerless to move them and they exploit that knowing that by the time the law catches up with them, they'll have already moved on.

'Sadly, it'll be too late for the children by that time and there are no plans to re-schedule sports day.'

Heather Lockley, 34, whose daughter goes to the school, added: 'It's not fair that these selfish people can ruin it for so many excited children.

'Wherever they go they leave rubbish and a trail of destruction behind them and now they have spoilt sports day.

'I wouldn't be surprised if they leave these fields in a mess and it takes a long time to clean up before it's safe for the children.

'My daughter and her friends have been looking forward to sports day for weeks and I know all the parents were looking forward to it too.

'I hope the council come down on them like a tonne of bricks.'

Local Labour councillor Ian Angus said: 'It is a much-loved and much-used park. It is very disappointing for the children.'
