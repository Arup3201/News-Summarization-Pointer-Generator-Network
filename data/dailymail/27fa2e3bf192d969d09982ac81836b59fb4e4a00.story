Carlo Ancelotti takes his team to Liverpool this week

There will be no statue of Carlo Ancelotti outside the renovated Santiago Bernabeu if the £500million facelift complete with Abu Dhabi naming rights ever gets completed.

The former Chelsea coach who brings his Real Madrid side to Anfield on Wednesday might have ended the club’s 12-year wait for a 10th European Cup in his first season in charge, but he knows his place.

‘I have heard people say that we won it in spite of me, and that I don’t have the personality to lead the team. I just laugh it off,’ he says. He also knows that despite constantly being damned by faint praise and having had his team broken up at the end of the season, he is better off than the man he faces in Group B this week.

‘Liverpool always have a good side but this year they are suffering because of losing Luis Suarez, who guaranteed so many goals,’ he says.

Ancelotti lost key players Angel di Maria and Xabi Alonso but £100m was spent on replacements Toni Kroos and James Rodriguez. Despite the quality of the new players it was still typical of Madrid that they should break up a European Cup-winning team.

Ancelotti, ever the politician, told Spanish radio Cadena Cope last week: ‘There are certain times when a club should say “No”. You cannot change club policy for one player. Di Maria asked for a lot of money and preferred to leave to get that money elsewhere. I manage for the club not the players.’

Angel di Mari left the Bernabeu for Manchester United in a £60m deal this summer

Behind the diplomacy he knows that Di Maria’s enormous contribution last season meant that the wage he was asking for was not unreasonable. Alonso is another who was moved on. The Spaniard left because he was feeling a ‘bit tired’ says the Italian coach. Not half as tired as Kroos and Rodriguez have looked at times this season trying to keep their heads above water in midfield.

The central trio last season of Luka Modric, Alonso and Di Maria offered the perfect balance. The former Liverpool midfielder sat, and either side of him Modric and Di Maria went up and down the pitch like pistons, Now it is Kroos sitting and Rodriguez and Modric going box to box.

Kroos is a wonderful footballer but the jury is still out on whether that holding midfield spot should be his.

And Rodriguez’s inability to cover the same miles as Di Maria has meant Ancelotti has had to adjust. ‘Gareth Bale comes back a little bit more to make it a midfield four,’ he says.

He has made a brilliant managerial career out of tinkering to fit the whims of various powerful owners.

He was asked this week what it has been like working for Silvio Berlusconi, Roman Abramovich and now Florentino Perez. ‘I have been lucky enough to work with some very intelligent presidents who didn’t just know about football but were also successful businessmen, intelligent enough not to tell me which players to pick,’ he said, ever the diplomat.
