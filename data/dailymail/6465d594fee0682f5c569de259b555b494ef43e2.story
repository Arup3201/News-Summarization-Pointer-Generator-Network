Red Bull Racing have launched their 2015 Formula One car race livery for the upcoming season as they hope to recapture their titles.

Their new 2015 RB11 car has been used in F1 testing with a camouflage livery in order to ward off rival teams attempting to copy their design secrets.

Red Bull won consecutive Drivers' and Constructors titles between 2010-13 but relinquished their crowns to a dominant Mercedes and Lewis Hamilton last season. 

Red Bull Racing have tweeted this picture of their 2015 RB11 car with this season's livery, which is back in their usual team colours

The new colour scheme was displayed on the team's Twitter page with the hashtag '#BackInColour' as Red Bull returned to their usual look.

The most notable shape change to the 2015 car is the lower nose box and front of the chassis, which were amended in line with the latest regulations.

Drivers Daniel Ricciardo and Daniil Kvyat have been putting the camouflaged RB11 through F1 testing in Catalunya but have managed a staggering 397 less laps than reigning champions Mercedes on the track as they look to close the gap.

Red Bull only won three races last season, thanks to the efforts of Ricciardo, as their power-unit supplier Renault struggled and Mercedes dominated to win 16 of the 19 Grand Prixs.

Australian driver Ricciardo is optimistic about the season opener but admits Mercedes are clear favourites:

'In terms of the pecking order, which is obviously what everyone wants to talk about, it's hard to say where anyone is at,' Ricciardo told Red Bull Racing's website.

'Aside from one team, I'd say it's pretty close after that, but we'll see in Melbourne. I think there's more to come from us. 

'Personally, I feel really ready to race now and I think we'll be good come Melbourne.' 

Ricciardo and Kyvat, who has replaced Ferrari's new signing Sebastian Vettell in the hotseat, will hit the grid for the first Grand Prix of the season in Melbourne on March 15.
