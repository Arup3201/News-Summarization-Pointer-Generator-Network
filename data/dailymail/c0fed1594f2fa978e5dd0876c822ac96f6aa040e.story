As a nation of wildlife lovers we are used to seeing animals perform in front of the camera.

But for this curious red squirrel, experiencing life behind the lens seems to be a more attractive proposition.

The female took it upon herself  to examine the camera when an unsuspecting wildlife photographer turned his back for a moment in woodlands near Hexham, Northumberland.

The inquisitive rodent first scrambled on to a tree trunk before plucking up the courage to move in for a closer look.

Sightings of red squirrels are a rarity in the British countryside. While the animals are native to the UK, their future is under threat as the grey squirrel, introduced from North America, becomes ever more dominant.

There are now estimated to be just 140,000 red squirrels left in Britain. In contrast, there are more than 2.5 million greys.

Recently, Prince Charles, the patron of the Red Squirrel Survival Trust, has led efforts to reintroduce the species into Cornwall and the  Scilly Isles.
