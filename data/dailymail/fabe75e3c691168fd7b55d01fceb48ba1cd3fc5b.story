He's known for leading an extravagant lifestyle - but millionaire popstar Snoop Dogg forwent the bling by staying at a Holiday Inn Express hotel after a gig in Devon, last weekend.

The US rapper, also known as Snoop Lion and Snoopzilla, stayed at the mid-price hotel in Sowton, Exeter after his exclusive DJ set at the Timepiece nightclub on Saturday.

The 42-year-old and his entourage checked out at 3pm on Sunday after chatting with staff and customers and having his photo taken.

Snoop Dogg got paid around £22,000 for the two hour gig at Timepiece which had the 400-strong sell-out crowd.

The star 
requested Hennessey champagne and Grey Goose vodka upon their arrival to the
 Timepiece nightclub at around 12.45am, which they enjoyed until they left at just after 3am.

Snoop Dogg and his staff were then driven from Newquay to Exeter by Nathan Guscott, of Gemini Taxis.

Mr Guscott said: 'When we collected him and he'd just come off stage he was 
buzzing from the festival, they were all in a good mood and having a 
laugh and a giggle, but seemed quite tired.

'Snoop seemed quite chilled out.

'After the gig, they all seemed pretty relaxed and in high spirits and were talking about the gig.

'When he got out he thanked me and shook my hand.

'He was really pleasant and having been a fan of his from a young age, it was an honour to work for him.'

Debbie
 Hamnett, general manager at the Holiday Inn Express Exeter, said Snoop 
was the perfect guest and said the booking for several rooms had been 
made back in July.

'We didn't know it was him until he checked in. All the team were in awe and just thought, wow, out of all the hotels in Exeter and he's staying here!

'He had a late check out at 3pm and spent time chatting to the staff and having his photo taken with them and customers.

'He was very pleasant and very polite and happy go lucky.

'They left the rooms in an absolutely perfect state.'

Snoop Dogg is thought to have been offered substantially more cash to play at other venues, including one on the island of Jersey, but he honoured his commitment to Exeter.

Owner of Timepiece nightclub, George Sloane, said: 'When he agreed, I thought he must have got us mixed up with another club.

'But they had done all their research and knew it was used to be an old church, had seen the pictures of the old gravestones, knew it was a small club and apparently Snoop was really excited about an intimate evening.'
