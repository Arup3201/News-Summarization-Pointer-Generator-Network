A senior pastor at an Oklahoma megachurch - who happens to be a married father of five - resigned on Tuesday after he admitted to infidelity.

Rev. Mark Crow of Victory Church stepped down 'after confessing to marital unfaithfulness,' executive pastor Rev. Dale Swanson said on Thursday in a statement to NewsOk.

'The Victory Church family and staff are praying for Mark, that the same grace we all experience and draw comfort from in our own spiritual journey, will be ever present in Mark’s transition to healing and wholeness,' he said.

Swanson also said that Victory Church will offer resources to the apparently troubled reverend, citing his 'fractured relationships.'

'Mark will be focusing his full attention on his personal relationship with God, and beginning the process of bringing healing to the fractured relationships in his life and family,' he said.

'Victory Church is fully committed to providing the counselors and ministers who will guide him through the process of reconciliation with God, and ensuring the best possible outcome for this next season in his life.'

Crow founded Victory Church in 1994 with his wife and fellow pastor Jennifer, according to its website. It now has operates five locations, including a branch in Lesotho.

The couple are parents to five children and have been married for over twenty years, according to Pastor Jennifer's book 'Perfect Lies.' She also is a grandmother to three children, according to her page with Victory Church.

On a separate website, Crow says she was 'miraculously healed' in 2003 after fighting multiple 'incurable' conditions and depression.

Her Facebook page and Twitter, however, currently appear disabled, as does her husband's Facebook page and website.
