Black is the new, erm, black, this weekend with the return of proper football boots. 

Many of us would have been forgiven for thinking plain boots were a thing of the past, sent to the footballing equivalent of Room 101, lost in the Bermuda Triangle.

Red and orange and yellow and green, indigo, violet and blue; the colours of the rainbow really have helped to light up the game’s top leagues over the last decade.

Cristiano Ronaldo will wear all-black boots in Real Madrid's La Liga clash against Barcelona on Saturday 

Ronaldo, who scored in Real Madrid's 3-0 defeat of Liverpool on Tuesday, will don black boots this weekend 

Indeed only one of the 22 who started Manchester City's Champions League tie at CSKA Moscow stuck with tradition, and it was the nosts' No 25. You know, Elvir Rahimic? OK, me neither.  

But now thanks to the planet’s biggest player, black will be back on the menu this weekend and with it a nod to football’s days of yore. Hallelujah.

Cristiano Ronaldo, the footballer of the year, will wear black boots in the globe’s biggest game when Real Madrid host Barcelona in El Clasico on Saturday. And the Portugal superstar will not be alone.

Dutchman Robin van Persie will also be donning black footwear when he takes to the Old Trafford dancefloor for the visit of Premier League leaders Chelsea.

Between them, Ronaldo and Van Persie will help to provide footballing fans with a throwback to yesteryear; and with it some nostalgia for those of us who grew up where black was the only option on the colour chart.

I was probably about nine or 10, when our star striker turned up to match in a pair of all-white boots. Our manager was stunned.

‘Take those off,’ he blasted. ‘You’ll be a target for the opposition; they’ll want to kick you off the park because you think you're special.’

Despite the flicks of red and green, Manchester United's Treble-winning side wore predominantly black boots

The striker in question sent his dad home and asked him to bring back his black boots.

He then begrudgingly walked back to the changing room, pulled on his Adidas Predators, and promptly bagged a hat-trick.

Take a walk to your local playing field on a Sunday morning in 2014 however, and you’ll be hard-pressed to find a kid sporting a black pair of boots. 

Wayne Rooney, Neymar, Lionel Messi and Co all wear coloured boots. So, why wouldn’t they?

Ronaldo’s nod to footballing nostalgia could however, buck that trend. 

They’re not proper football boots, mind. He’ll be donning that daft sock boot, but I guess it’s a start...
