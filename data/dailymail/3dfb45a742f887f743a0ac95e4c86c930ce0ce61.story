Plea: Mr Bryson's wife Janice, 49, and sons Jack, 20, and Harry, 24, are desperate for him to come home for Christmas

He kissed his wife goodbye with the words ‘see you tonight’ before leaving for work at the usual time.

But health manager Neil Bryson, 50, never made it to the office and vanished without trace.

Almost four weeks later Mr Bryson’s disappearance remains a complete mystery.

An apparently happily-married father-of-two, he had a good job, with no financial problems and no history of depression.

His
wife Janice, 49, and sons Jack, 20, and Harry, 24, have been left 
heartbroken and are clinging on to the hope he suddenly returns for 
Christmas.

Mrs Bryson said: ‘Everyone is absolutely devastated by this, it is so out of character.

‘There
will be no Christmas this year at our house. We will have his mum over 
on Christmas Day and just try and have a normal day and try and support 
her.

‘I just want him home, I
just want him to know it is OK to come home. Whatever has happened it 
can be sorted out, I just need to get him home, the boys need him home.’

In a direct plea to her husband, she added: ‘Neil, I just want you to know how much I love you and want you home.’ Mrs Bryson said she knows of no reason why her husband would leave home or take his own life.

The couple, who have been married for 27 years, live in the picturesque village of Scholes, near Holmfirth, West Yorkshire.

Mr Bryson left home at 6.30am on November 27 and his car was found abandoned the following afternoon at Yateholme Reservoir – one of his favourite walking spots.

Missing: Neil Bryson, 50, vanished from his home in Scholes, North Yorks, almost four weeks ago. There was no clue that anything was wrong

Police mounted a full-scale search involving the force helicopter, sniffer dogs, divers and 20 members of the local mountain rescue team.

Mr Bryson worked as head of operations for older people’s mental health services at the Bradford District Care Trust. He had no apparent worries in his role and his wife said he had a happy home life.

She said they had celebrated her birthday the weekend before he went missing by going shopping and eating out.

Caring: Mr Bryson with wife Janice, who says his disappearance is a complete mystery

They were planning to book their annual holiday to the Canary Islands in the New Year and Mr Bryson was due to move to a new job in the same line of work.

The evening before he went missing, Mr Bryson laughed as he looked through holiday snaps with his family.

Mr Bryson is 6ft tall and slim. When he was last seen he was wearing a dark suit with shirt and tie and a dark brown Barbour coat.

Nicola Less, of Bradford NHS Care Trust, said: ‘His disappearance is of great concern to all who know and work with him.

‘We are doing everything possible to assist the police in their efforts to locate him and we are in regular contact with his family.’
