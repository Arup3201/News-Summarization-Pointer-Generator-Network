Real Madrid defender Alvaro Arbeloa says he would be worried about playing Liverpool at Anfield even if they had lost 10-0 to QPR at the weekend.

The former Liverpool full back has warned his team-mates Liverpool will pose a threat despite their underwhelming form.

Liverpool were unconvincing in Sunday’s 3-2 win over QPR but Champions League holders Real insist they will be on their guard.

Cristiano Ronaldo has told team-mates to expect a hostile atmosphere at Anfield, having failed to score there during his time at Manchester United, and Arbeloa added: ‘I’ve been telling them the same thing but Cristiano has mentioned he always found this the most difficult away ground from his time in the Premier League.

‘Many things have changed from the last times the teams met [in 2009], both clubs have brought in new players, but I think the Anfield atmosphere on a European night will always be the same.

‘Even league matches have a special atmosphere here. It is difficult to explain, you just have to experience it. Every player should try it at least once in his career.

‘People are telling me Liverpool did not play all that well at the weekend but, believe me, if they had lost 10-0 at QPR I would still be worried about coming here for a European night. We are expecting a tough game.’

Ronaldo has scored 17 goals in nine games for his club so far this season and Arbeloa said: ‘The form Cristiano is currently showing is incredible. The records he is setting in Spain at the moment take some believing.

‘I don’t know if he is in the best form of his career, other people may be better placed to judge, but confidence-wise I’d say he is the highest he could be right now.’
