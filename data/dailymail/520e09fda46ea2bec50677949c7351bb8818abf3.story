Victim: Police have warned members of the public to carry personal alarms after cyclist Aulton Thomas Rogers was stabbed to death in a 'frenzied' attack

Police have warned members of the public to carry personal alarms after a cyclist was stabbed to death in a frenzied attack as he rode home from work.

Aulton Thomas Rogers - known to friends and colleagues as Tom - was found lying alongside a cycle path, having been stabbed repeatedly.

Detectives hunting the 60-year-old's killer admitted they had no idea why Mr Rogers, who lived alone in Swindon, Wiltshire, was murdered.

Officers believe he was ambushed by a stranger in the unprovoked attack.

After his body was discovered on Thursday and with the knifeman still at large, police have drafted in extra 
officers to patrol the streets and advised people to carry a personal attack alarm.

'My message to the 
public is to make sure people know where you are going and what time you
 are due back home,' said local policing commander Superintendent Andrew Carr.

'Make sure you have got a mobile phone and it has 
credit on it. Make sure you are aware of your surroundings and carry a personal alarm if you can.'

Supt. Carr said people who felt 
concerned for their safety should call 999 immediately and not worry 
about the possibly wasting police time.

Mr Rogers had left the Woodlands Edge Public House where he worked just before 10.30pm on Thursday.

Police were called by a shocked passer-by who stumbled across the scene shortly before midnight.

Mr Rogers was found lying to the right-hand side of the cycle path and his bicycle was on the ground nearby.

Detective Chief Inspector Sean Memory, who is leading the hunt for Mr Rogers's killer, said it was a 'horrendous scene' and that the victim has stood 'no chance.'

A post mortem examination confirmed that he died as a result of multiple stab wounds.

DCI Memory said: 'Mr Rogers was not known to police and there is no apparent motive for the attack.

'We continue to work tirelessly on the case to identify those responsible and would ask anyone who knew Mr Rogers to contact us. This will help us to build a bigger picture of his lifestyle,' added the senior detective.

'He worked at the Woodlands Edge Public house in Midwinter Close, Swindon and we know that he left the pub shortly before 10.30pm on Thursday, June 26, 2014.

'I would particularly like to hear from anyone who saw Mr Rogers on Thursday night, any information will be dealt with in the strictest confidence.'

Mr Rogers, who lived alone in Swindon, was described as white, approximately 5ft 9ins tall and of very slim build with grey hair.

He was wearing black trousers, a black polo shirt and a khaki hoodie. He had black trainers and was carrying a dark blue bag.

It was revealed that the spot where he was found is known locally as 'muggers alley' because a number of recent violent offences had taken place there.

Last month a 24-year-old woman suffered serious injuries in the underpass after she was approached from behind by an unknown male who landed a single blow to the back of her head.

Forensic officers wearing white boiler suits were yesterday continuing to examine the scene and had closed a large section of the cycle path off.

Fingertip searches were being made of the cycle route as the killer was believed to have walked his victim's blood along the path.

The attacker was also believed to have been injured in the attack.

CCTV footage from the surrounding area was being meticulously reviewed by specialist officers as they probed more than 60 leads about the murder.
