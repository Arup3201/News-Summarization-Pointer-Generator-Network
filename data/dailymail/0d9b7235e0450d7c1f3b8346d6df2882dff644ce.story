New York Home Depot employee Kirk Soccorso said he was fired because he has 'Isis', the name of his ex-girlfriend, tattooed on the inside of his lip

A New York Home Depot employee says he was fired because he has 'Isis', the name of his ex-girlfriend, tattooed on the inside of his lip. 

Kirk Soccorso said he got the tattoo four years ago while dating his ex-girlfriend, who is named after the Egyptian goddess of nature. 

Soccorso said he had no idea 'until just recently' that the acronym stood for the Islamic State of Iraq and Syria, an extremist terrorist group. 

So when Soccorso overheard a co-worker using the word he decided to show off his old tattoo.

Soccorso, who had been working at the Long Island store for six months as a tool demonstrator, said he was then let go from his job and told not to return. 

'I feel a little lost,' he told News 12 Long Island. 'It was a good paying job.' 

Soccorso said it was never his intention to scare anyone and that he was 'just making conversation' when he revealed his inked lip. 

'I want a chance for my job back,' he said.

A spokesman for Home Depot told News 12 that the decision to fire Soccorso wasn't 'just based on the tattoo'.  

Soccorso, who said he didn't know what the acronym stood for until 'just recently', overheard a co-worker using the word and decided to show off his old tattoo. He was let go from his job soon after
