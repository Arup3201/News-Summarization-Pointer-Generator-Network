It's a British summer tradition, famous for its beautiful blooms and the occasional wacky garden design.

Now the Chelsea Flower Show, which opens next week, has gone high fashion after Gucci unveiled its whimsical garden inspired by its classic Flora motif.

The Gucci Flora Garden is designed by Sarah Eberle and includes many of the varieties immortalised in the print, which made its debut in 1966 on a silk scarf.

Glamorous: Gucci's Chelsea Flower Show garden was inspired by its classic Flora print, designed in 1966

Commissioned by Rodolfo Gucci, one of Gucci founder Guccio Gucci’s four sons, the Flora design has royal, as well as botanical connotations.

In need of a suitable gift for Princess Grace of Monaco, Rodolfo commissioned artist Vittorio Accornero to create a floral pattern for an silk scarf, which he then presented to the royal instead of a bouquet.

Accornero's design, which was completed in time for a visit to the Gucci boutique in Milan by the Monégasque princess, eventually included a riot of naturalistic flowers, fruit and insects and was dedicated to the four seasons.

'When I first joined Gucci, I immediately asked to see the archive, and it was there that I rediscovered the Flora pattern,' remembers creative director, Frida Giannini.

Inspiration: The Flora print was created for Princess Grace of Monaco who visited the brand's Milan boutique

Pretty: The gorgeous Flora print has been revived for a new version of the £1, 480 Lady Lock bag

'I remember chic women – my mother and grandmother among them – wearing Flora scarves in the 70s, and I’ve always been fascinated by the story behind the design and how it was created for Princess Grace.

Although the silk scarves are no longer available, Gucci has launched a new version of its iconic Lady Lock bag featuring the canvas print.

First introduced in 1947, the bag, which starts at £1,480, is made from canvas emblazoned with the flora print and includes the trademark bamboo cane handle specially made for the fashion house by artisan craftsmen in Florence. 

Almost there: The RHS Chelsea Flower Show opens on the 20th May and runs until the 24th

Hotly anticipated: Tickets have sold faster than ever this year, although Alan Titchmarsh won't be there

'Flora was the very first iconic design motif from Gucci’s past that I decided to revive and reinterpret,' adds Giannini.

'Since then I have used it on bags, dresses, scarves (of course) and as the inspiration for a series of fragrances.

'I am so excited by the prospect of finally seeing Flora as a real garden at the RHS Chelsea Flower Show; there is something truly magical about this project.'

The RHS Chelsea Flower Show opens on the 20th May and runs until the 24th. For more information and tickets, see rhs.org.uk
