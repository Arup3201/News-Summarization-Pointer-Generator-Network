John has won us over with his charm in BBC's Wimbledon commentary box

John McEnroe doesn't take long to list just some of the things that make him angry.

'Well, being in the car would be number one – there's quite a bit of yelling,' he says. 'And then I hate it when someone is not upfront. I'm a tell-it-like-it-is kind of person; I don't like being misled or someone not telling the truth. That upsets me.'

His voice gets louder. 'And if people lie to me, especially my kids, well, I'm not big on that. And I also don't like it when people make rash decisions. If people do things without thinking them through, that rubs me up the wrong way.'

Clearly, he's still a man you wouldn't want to get on the wrong side of, however charming he may seem in his job as a TV commentator.

He may be one of the tennis greats, proud owner of seven Grand Slam singles titles, but he'll always be best known for his tantrums on court, the fury that would be vented at umpires, linesmen... and his racquets.

He has a funny relationship with that side of his fame, or perhaps we should call it infamy. On the one hand he realises it made him stand out and got people interested in watching him. But the controversy that surrounded him still rankles.

'Some of it was deserved,' he concedes. 'But it did feel like some of it was completely overboard, particularly in the UK. The attention that's lavished on tennis, especially at Wimbledon, is greater than anything I've experienced. I felt like I was battling everybody.

'I'm 55 now and it would be amazing if a day went by where somebody didn't come up to me and say, "You cannot be serious!" But it never happens. That phrase, which I only really said once (at Wimbledon in 1981), is part of me now.

It's crazy. When I play at a veterans' tournament – like the Masters Tennis at the Royal Albert Hall in December – if I don't say it people are disappointed. It's ironic – people used to want to suspend me and talk about how bad my behaviour was, but now they like it when I shout and scream.'

So how does he sum up his relationship with the great British tennis-loving public? 'It's been a long run, and it's gone to every extreme, but as time marches on it seems like we've found inner peace,' he says.

It's fair to say John is pretty much universally loved today as the BBC's charming and knowledgeable tennis commentator. He's also an ambassador for insurance company Aegon, the sponsor of British tennis.

'I'm having a lot more fun than I used to,' he says. 'Now my work is about entertainment rather than a battle to the end. I can appreciate the experience a lot more. The girls and boys out there playing have a much more difficult time than I do.

'When I was playing I was very serious about what I was trying to do. Often I was up against more intimidating, physical presences, so I had to get an edge through my intensity and my desire. I had to be super intense.'

He's glad people like him now. 'It's been a pleasant surprise,' he says. 'I felt very misunderstood before but some of that was because I wasn't allowing people to see the whole package. Through commentating I can display a different side of my personality. I do have a sense of humour. I have more time to think about things and the way I behave.'

He was particularly glad not to have been in Andy Murray's shoes just before Wimbledon last year. 'I never had as much attention as Andy gets but I think I understand what he was going through more than most. It's brilliant he broke the losing streak – and Britain finally had a Wimbledon champion. There won't be the same degree of pressure on him this year; but believe me, once you win it you want to win it again.'

'I congratulated Ivan when I saw him 
because I thought it was a job well done. As much as we had 
issues on the court, I think there's a mutual respect between us.'

Murray was coached by John's on-and-off court rival Ivan Lendl; despite the derogatory comments traded between the two men in their heyday, he admits he admired the job Lendl did on the Scot. 'I congratulated Ivan when I saw him because I thought it was a job well done,' he says. 'As much as we had issues on the court, I think there's a mutual respect between us.'

His other most famous court foe was Bjorn Borg; despite their rivalry they became friends and remain so, often meeting on the veteran pro circuit.

John still plays tennis twice a week at his academy near his Manhattan home and goes to the gym three times. He's also an unlikely fan of gentle Pilates, which he does once a week. His hobby is playing the guitar and he's a keen collector of modern art.

'Artists and tennis players have a lot in common; you're out there, unarmoured, by yourself. I mainly buy; I enjoy waking up and seeing something that gives me pleasure.'

Despite the list of things that still annoy him, John's clearly calmed down a little. He attributes that partly to being a father; he has five children. The eldest three, from his famously volatile first marriage to former drug-addict actress Tatum O'Neal, have all left home. But the younger two with his second wife, musician Patty Smyth – 15-year-old Ava and 18-year-old Anna – are still at home.

'My kids would tell you I still have a temper but I'm more even-keeled than I was,' he says. 'Being a father forces you to try and become steadier. If you're wildly inconsistent that's tough for kids to handle.

'It helps that I'm in a good situation with my wife; I try to be a good husband. I've had therapy and that can be helpful. My goal each year is to be one per cent better, more empathetic than I was. If I feel there's been a slight improvement then that's all the victory I need these days.'

John is an Aegon Retiready brand ambassador and presents Wimbledon coverage on the BBC from Monday, see pages 16-17 for more details.
