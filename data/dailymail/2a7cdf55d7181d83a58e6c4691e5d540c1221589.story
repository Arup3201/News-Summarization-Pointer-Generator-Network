It has been nine days since the Malaysia Airlines jet was shot down over a remote war-torn corner of eastern Ukraine.

But as world leaders prevaricate over their response to an act of mass murder, the disgraceful failure to recover all 298 victims of flight MH17 was all too evident yesterday.

Three generations of one Ukrainian family could be seen picking their way through the wreckage like people inspecting the aftermath of a storm.

Picking through the wreckage: A family of Ukrainians walk through the MH17 crash site which is still littered with victims' bodies, belongings and wreckage 

Plundered: A child’s belongings spill out of an opened suitcase. It is one of many to have been rifled through at the crash site since the plane came down on July 17

Many bodies are still lost in the fields of sunflowers that surround the area – and could remain until the 5ft high crops are harvested next month.

But it is the inescapable stench of rotting flesh in 30C heat that is so distressing – at a site controlled by the same heavily armed pro-Russian rebels accused of destroying the Boeing 777 with a missile.

It can only be guessed what the families of those who lost their lives on the flight from Amsterdam to Kuala Lumpur must make of it all.

Although the repatriation flights have begun, just 200 bodies and an unspecified number of body parts have so far been sent to the Netherlands for identification.

Almost a third of the 298 killed – who included ten Britons – could still be missing and may never be found. The band of inexperienced Kalashnikov-wielding recruits in charge in this corner of Ukraine has refused access to international forensic experts. 

As a result, the crash scene – which stretches for miles across the farming villages of Rassypnoe, Grabovo and Petropavloka – remains in a state of ugly chaos.

Distressing: One woman breaks down in tears as she looks at the debris from MH17 which landed in a field of sunflowers in Rassipnoye, eastern Ukraine

Persistent looting means vital evidence – and sentimental keepsakes – have been lost. Parts of the plane have been stolen to be sold as scrap.

Giant pieces of fuselage are strewn for miles, along with twisted burnt metal, suitcases and clothing. Parts of the doomed jet’s cockpit lie surrounded by personal possessions that have clearly been tampered with or stolen from.

Wallets – emptied of cash – lie next to children’s shoes and toys. A baby’s bottle rests by a pile of opened letters. Nearby, a collection of classical music is scattered across the charred ground.

Also still visible are the remains of animals and birds from the jet’s hold, including pigeons, two dogs, peacocks and parrots.

Some locals have begun to light candles around the debris and to lay teddy bears in memory of the 80 children who died.

Retired miner Alexander Benayka, 57, who lives yards from the crashed cockpit, said many bodies are still hidden in the sunflowers as temperatures soar.

The father of two, one of 200 volunteers told by the rebels to search for bodies, said: ‘You can smell them everywhere. It is too hot. There are also wild dogs here. The bodies will not last much longer. We need international forces to help search the site properly before it is too late.

‘The bodies are in the fields but you cannot see them for the sunflowers. We do not harvest until the end of August so unless someone comes to help, they will not be uncovered until then.’

Tears streaming down his face, Mr Benayka added: ‘I saw many dead children here by my house. I bring flowers and light candles as respect for them.’

Grieving relatives have told of how credit cards and mobile phones belonging to victims have been used since the crash.

The Foreign Office yesterday said it will work with relatives to help protect against fraud.

Respect: Funeral hearses carrying the first 40 victims of MH17 arrived at the Korporaal van Oudheusden Kazerne barracks in Hilversum, The Netherlands on Thursday

Tributes: Hundreds of flowers and tributes were laid n Eindhoven, Netherlands, as several of the bodies of the MH17 victims were transported back to the country

The crash investigation is being led by a Dutch team as 194 of those killed were from the Netherlands.

Yesterday, a small group was able to visit part of the scene, while a group of 40 Dutch policemen are reported to be on their way to try to help secure the area. Some 90 Australian military police are on standby in London.

Australian Prime Minister Tony Abbott fears some remains will never be recovered unless security is tightened.

US Ambassador to the Ukraine Jeffrey Pyatt said the crash site is ‘a giant crime scene and needs to be treated that way.’ ‘Further destruction of the wreckage must be stopped. It’s tragic that the site has still not fully been secured,’ he added.
