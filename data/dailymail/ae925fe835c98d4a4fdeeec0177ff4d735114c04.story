When Colorado teacher Jen Sculley heard one of her students desperately needed a kidney transplant she didn't think twice about offering to help.

The physical education teacher at Denver's East High School and her student, who has not been named, are both making good progress after their operations on Friday.

Miss Sculley offered to help the girl as a way to honor an aunt who died recently from cancer and who shared the same name as the student.

Generous: Jen Sculley recovers in hospital after donating a kidney to one of her students

She first learned of her student's health problems when the girl, who was having dialysis every day, told her she wouldn't be able to join in all the activities in the sports class.

The student has FSGS, a rare disease that attacks the kidney's filtering process. As she explained her problems, Miss Sculley said she heard a clear voice saying: 'You are going to give her a kidney.'

The girl's family and friends had already put themselves forward as possible donors but no match had been found - until Miss Sculley was tested.

The teacher said she was moved to help as a way to honor her aunt who had died from lung cancer over the summer.

'Through her I get to pass on the memory of my aunt and that’s amazing,' Miss Sculley told KCNC-TV/DenverCBS.

Colleagues at the Denver school, with its motto 'Home of the angels', praised Miss Sculley's actions.

'I’ve never seen a teacher in my 36 years go above and beyond to that extent,' Rudy Carey, a teacher at the school, said.

Connection: The girl who received Jen's kidney goes to Denver's East High School, where the teacher works

Miss Sculley is taking a month off work to recover from the operation, but knowing the student will have the chance to lead a happy, healthy life is keeping her strong.

The
 girl who received the kidney is making a good recovery, and even 
walked across the hospital the day after her life-saving surgery so she 
could thank her teacher.

'When she’s 50 they’re going to be like, "You still have that old gym teacher’s kidney?" And she’s going to be like, "Yeah",' Miss Sculley said.
