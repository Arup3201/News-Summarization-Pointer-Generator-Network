Sainsbury's supermarket has recalled all of its own-brand watercress after it was linked to an E.coli outbreak that has made 15 people ill.

The Food Standards Agency issued an alert last night after six people affected by the outbreak were hospitalised.

It is thought their illness is linked to watercress products bought in Sainsbury’s over the past six weeks.

Danger: Sainsbury's baby leaf watercress, spinach & rocket salad is one of the products recalled by the retailer after its watercress products were linked to an E.coli outbreak that has left 15 people ill, with six in hospital

The supermarket has recalled six different products containing the watercress as a ‘precautionary measure’ following the possible link to the outbreak of E.coli O157.

A Sainsbury’s spokesman said their tests had not found any traces of E.coli in any products, and that no other Sainsbury’s supermarket products are known to be affected.

The FSA says on its website: ‘[Sainsbury’s] is advising people not to consume any of these products and to return them to the store they were purchased from for a full refund.

‘Investigations by the Food Standards Agency, Public Health England and local authorities are continuing and further information will be provided once it becomes available.

‘Sainsbury’s has informed the FSA that it is carrying out testing on all of its affected lines, but that no trace of E.coli O157 has been detected to date.’

Escherichia coli (E coli) is a bacteria which causes food poisoning, including symptoms such as diarrhoea and stomach cramps. It is usually contracted by eating contaminated food but can also be passed from person to person by poor hand washing.

The FSA, Public Health England and 
local authorities are investigating the matter and the FSA confirmed no 
other supermarkets had recalled products.

A
spokesman for Sainsbury’s said: ‘The Food Standards Agency has made us 
aware that a small number of people have fallen ill with a bacterial 
infection, and that one of their lines of investigation is watercress 
bought at Sainsbury’s since August 1.

‘Customer safety and the quality of our food are our overriding concern, and so although no traces of contamination has been found in our products we have as a precautionary measure withdrawn six lines of pre-packed salad containing watercress from the supplier concerned.

‘We are urgently testing all similar products and have to date found no indication of contamination. We will of course keep customers fully updated.

‘Customers who have bought any of these products from Sainsbury’s since August 1 should not consume them. They can be returned to store for a full refund. We apologise for the inconvenience this may cause.’

Last year seven people were infected with E.Coli after visiting Sutton Park in Sutton Coldfield, in the West Midlands.

And in 2011 a deadly mutant strain of the bacteria was identified, which was capable of spreading from person to person and had been found in 12 countries.

Hundreds were left seriously ill by the outbreak and at least 18 died.
