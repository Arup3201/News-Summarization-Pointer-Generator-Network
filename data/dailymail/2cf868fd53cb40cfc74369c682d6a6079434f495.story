Britons are more likely to be glued to the goggle box than almost any other nation in Europe, with a third of us watching at least three hours of television every weekday.

Only Bulgarians are bigger TV addicts, according to a survey of 30 European countries.

Just 13 per cent of Germans watch the box for more than three hours a day, compared with 43 per cent in Bulgaria and 32 per cent in the UK, the European Social Survey says.

Britons watch more television than almost any other nation in Europe with a third of us tuning in for more than three hours every weekday

A total of 28 per cent of Irish for more than three hours a day.

The European average if 21 per cent.

But researchers did not ask about viewing habits at weekends, when many watch even more TV.

Despite our square eyes, Britons are among the least likely to watch news and current affairs, with 13 per cent not watching any during the working week.

The figure for Germany, Denmark and Finland is 4 per cent.

The average total for Europe is just eight per cent.

Some 43 per cent of Bulgarians spent at least three hours a day watching TV compared to just 13 per cent of Germans

Only in Israel, with 16 per cent, and Slovenia, with 15 per cent, do more people avoid news and current affairs on the box than in the UK.

Scientists said watching too much TV could be as harmful to health as smoking and obesity.

Every hour spent watching TV shortens your life by 22 minutes and watching for six hours a day shortens life expectancy by five years, according to one study.
