The parents of a four-year-old heart patient who died after 'shambolic' care at Bristol Children's Hospital have demanded a public inquiry after a coroner ruled that staff had not neglected him.

Steve, 47, and Yolanda Turner, 45, from Warminster in Wiltshire, said they found evidence about their son Sean's treatment 'shocking and unacceptable', adding that only a public inquiry would answer their questions.

At the end of the 10-day inquest yesterday, Avon coroner Maria Voisin recorded a narrative conclusion, saying that although there were 'lost opportunities' in Sean's care, they did not amount to neglect.

Robert Wooley, chief executive of the University Hospitals Bristol NHS Foundation Trust, apologised to Mr and Mrs Turner, and insisted changes had been made following Sean's death.

The couple had earlier branded Sean's care 'shambolic' and told the inquest how they had begged doctors and nurses on Ward 32 to help their desperately ill son.

Mrs Turner, a foster carer, told BBC Breakfast she wanted a public inquiry into her son's death.

'Sean suffered a lot of failings in his care. We feel at every level the ward did not recognise his deterioration and that led to the complications that led to his death,' she said.

'We feel there is much more that needs investigating and the coroner's inquest didn't do that fully.'

Her husband, a carpenter, added: 'I think we feel now that the coroner was very weak. We wished she would have done some letters of recommendation to the trust...We feel that Sean was treated very poorly.'

'We are pleased they have made changes within the hospital. We just feel they should have been imposed while Sean was in there,' he said.

'They obviously weren't in place when Sean was in there because they wouldn't have spent £1.3 million on it so soon after Sean... All we've ever wanted is the truth and we only want the hospital to be truthful with us that they failed Sean, and they did fail Sean.'

During the inquest, Mr and Mrs Turner gave harrowing accounts of their son's care and treatment during a six-week stay at the hospital, which is regarded as a centre of excellence.

They said Sean was so desperate for a glass of water that he resorted to sucking the moisture from tissues used to cool his forehead.

Mr and Mrs Turner accused doctors of transferring their son to Ward 32 from intensive care too soon and said they missed the signs of his worsening condition - with rising blood pressure, vomiting and fluid loss from his chest.

Sean, who was born with a congenital heart defect, died in March 2012 from a brain haemorrhage after previously suffering a cardiac arrest - six weeks after undergoing vital corrective heart surgery.

His parents claim their son's death was not isolated and said other children with heart problems have died at the hospital.

Together with the parents of seven-year-old Luke Jenkins, from Cardiff, Mr and Mrs Turner complained to the independent healthcare watchdog, the Care Quality Commission.

The CQC carried out an unannounced inspection and issued a formal warning to the hospital about standards on Ward 32.

A five-bed high-dependency unit has now been set up on Ward 32 and the trust commissioned its own independent review of paediatric nursing across the hospital with its findings implemented.

Trust chief executive Robert Woolley apologised to Mr and Mrs Turner and said the trust always sought to improve services.

'The coroner has heard that their son Sean was born with a very rare and complex heart condition and was undergoing a procedure which carries a known risk of death,' he said.

'But the inquest has also highlighted some missed opportunities in the care we gave to Sean when managing his post-operative complications and shortcomings in our communication with the family.

'We are always improving our services and we have made significant changes since Sean was on the ward in early 2012.'
