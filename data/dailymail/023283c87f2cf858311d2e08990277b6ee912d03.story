At 11.11am on Monday, 27 November 1944, a mushroom cloud, 50 yards wide, rose high above the village of Hanbury, Staffordshire.

Mounds of earth, weighing up to a ton each, fell to the ground after being lifted skywards. A nearby reservoir that had contained six million gallons of water was burst open. And a massive crater - 100 feet deep and 250 yards wide - was blasted into the unspoiled landscape.

This lasting scar, the Hanbury Crater, is a reminder of when the 4,000 tonnes of bombs and ammunition kept in the underground storerooms of RAF Fauld, Staffordshire, detonated in a single, deadly moment. 

The accident, Britain's biggest ever explosion, claimed the lives of at least 70 people and tore down homes in the nearby village of Hanbury.

Untamed: While the area of the crater, seen above in 2005, is home to birds and wildlife - humans are not allowed to walk across it

Lasting mark: The 1944 explosion blasted a massive crater - 100 feet deep and 250 yards wide (seen from above) - into the landscape

Scarred: The 12-acre patch of countryside (circled) - which is now filled with trees and shrubs - is cordoned off because of unexploded bombs

Today, a poignant memorial was unveiled, marking the 70th anniversary of the explosion - one of the biggest non-nuclear blasts ever recorded. 

More than 100 people attended the service, with family and friends of the 70 people who were killed gathering at the Cock Inn in Hanbury - which was seriously damaged in the explosion - to mark the anniversary. A memorial service was also held at St Werburgh's Church in the Staffordshire village.

The explosion was thought to have released about one-fifth of the force felt when the atom bomb was dropped on Hiroshima. It was heard in Birmingham - 32 miles away - and seismologists in Switzerland thought they had detected an earthquake.

The historic explosions occurred in 180,000 sq ft of underground corridors - 12ft high and 20ft wide - which were used to store RAF munitions during the Second World War. 

In these concrete passages, bombs and ammunition were tightly packed. During the wartime rush - when officers faced a shortage of quality manpower, and a higher demand on resources - corners were cut in the way the unit was run. 

Mark Rowe, who has been researching the explosion for 30 years, said an RAF inquiry into the explosion, which was only published in 1974, found it was an avoidable accident. 

Aftermath: The force of the blast, which killed at least 70 people, destroyed homes and shops in the nearby village of Hanbury, Staffordshire

Blast: Workers survey what remains in one part of the underground munitions storage unit at RAF Fauld after the devastating explosion

Wreckage: An RAF inquiry into the explosion found it was an avoidable accident. Above, a building brought to the ground by the blast

Crushed: Part of the tunnel is seen collapsed on top of one of the rows of bombs that were stacked underground during the Second World War

He added: 'The most likely explanation, according to the report, was that someone tried to remove an exploder pocket with a brass chisel. That caused a spark which set off the reaction.'

The report concluded: 'An airman was permitted to perform a dangerous operation in the mine. This indicates negligence on the part of the supervising staff present in the mine due either to lack of knowledge, lack of a proper sense of responsibility, or lack of proper direction from senior authority.' 

A solid underground wall meant that much of the underground storeroom did not go up on the blast - and a number of the men working made it to the surface on time. 

Most of the deaths, roughly 31 in total, came at a nearby plasterboard factory, when the blast broke a reservoir that sent a volcano-like sea of mud down a valley and engulfed everything in the way. 

Damage: One worker ventures underground to assess the extent of the destruction caused by the bombs, which detonated simultaneously

The rescue work took three months and was hindered by pockets of gas, 6 million gallons of water from the reservoir and 10,000 tons of rubble. Tragically, 18 of the 70 people killed were never found. 

The giant crater left behind by the blast is still visible 70 years on but is now filled with trees and shrubs and is home to birds and wildlife.

There are also signs warning ramblers or passers-by not to go into the area - which covers a 12-acre patch of countryside - because of unexploded bombs.

Near the edge of the crater is the first memorial for the tragedy, where the names of those who lost their lives are carved.

A service used to be held at the site every year until a decade ago when numbers dwindled and it was dropped after the 60th anniversary.

Parish council chairman Trevor Iball said: 'There was much more interest in that than a service by the crater and the parish council are supporting it.

What remained: Despite the force of the blast, parts of the underground storage facility survived. Fauld only ceased holding explosives in 1958

Tribute: A sign near the edge of the crater remembers those who lost their lives. Sadly, 18 bodies were never recovered in the search operation

Tranquil: A service to remember those who died in the explosion is held every year at Hanbury Crater, pictured above

'There has been a big response. We believe the RAF at Stafford and the Ministry of Defence will be among the people attending. I think it will be a fitting way to mark the anniversary.

'The outdoor services began when the memorial was erected 30 years ago but ten years ago there was only three of us, including the vicar. There was one lady who lost her brother but she admitted that it was getting beyond her.'

Reverend Les Rees, who conducted the service, said: 'We want to mark the anniversary for the village. People are still affected by it, it left its mark.

'At British Gypsum we will be unveiling the new memorial plaque and there will a short act of worship. There were people from different parts of the church killed, the Italian PoWs would have been Catholic. 'It's not just a Church of England event but for the whole community.'
