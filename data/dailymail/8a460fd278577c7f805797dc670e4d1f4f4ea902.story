Google glasses will be available to purchase by the end of the year for less than $1,500, according to reports.

The company's long-awaited tech toy, officially called 'Google Glass' is a voice-activated device designed to be worn like a pair of spectacles. 

Google just revealed new details this week on how they function as a number of employees have been spotted wearing them. The company is trying to fine-tune the design of the gadget before officially releasing it to the market, the tech website The Verge reported.

Google also revealed Glass will come with a set of lenses to turn them into sunglasses

The new video reveals how Google glass could be used - including this video chat between a users holding a snake and a young child shocked by the animal

Google has revealed for the first time what wearers of its Glass computer will see. Here, a message is received and displayed on screen. Users can speak to reply

Google Glass was also shown off giving directions to a driver passing over the Golden Gate Bridge in San Francisco, where employees have been seen wearing the glasses in recent weeks

Users can record video of what they see, and even see weather forecasts simply by asking for them

The glasses allow wearers to see 
sat-nav directions, take pictures and reply to emails - but until this week 
Google has refused to show how they actually work.

'Want to see how Glass actually feels? It's surprisingly simple,' Google said.

'Say "take a picture" to take a picture. Record what you see, hands free. Even share what you see, live.

'Directions are right in front of you.

'Speak to send a message, or translate your voice.

'Get the notifications that matter most.

'Ask whatever's on your mind and get answers without having to ask.'

The firm also said all of the footage was captured through Glass.

Project Glass will come in five colours - black, gray, blue, red or white and have removable shades.

The company is negotiating with Warby Parker, an e-commerce start-up company that sells trendy eyeglasses, to help it design more fashionable frames, according to the New York Times.

Google is also believed to be working with designers to try and make Glass less obtrusive and more stylish

Wearers will be able to ask questions - such as 'How long is the Brooklyn Bridge'

It also showed off a mockup of a more advanced version of the system, giving clearer directions to wearers

The system will also be able to automatically translate speech into another language

Another concept showed the glasses reminding a user of their flight as they move through an airport - telling them their current flight status

Google also detailed how the first people to get hold of them.

Potential
 'Explorer' early-adopters will have to apply in 50 words or less, 
including a short video (15 seconds max) and five photographs, to 
explain what they would do with the early version of Glass.

They
 will then have to order a $1,500 Project Glass 'Explorer' kit and 
attend the pick up in New York, LA or San Francisco in person.

'We’re looking for bold, creative individuals who want to join us and be a part of shaping the future of Glass,' the firm said.

'We’d love to make everyone an Explorer, but we’re starting off a bit smaller.

'We’re still in the early stages, and while we can’t promise everything will be perfect, we can promise it will be exciting.'

Google Glass will come in a range of colours - and the firm is working with spectacle designers to make the gadget look trendier

Google glass has a small screen, and is controlled by voice of gestures on a small trackpad on the arms of the glasses

The glasses use voice recognition, but also have a trackpad on one arm to negotiate menus
