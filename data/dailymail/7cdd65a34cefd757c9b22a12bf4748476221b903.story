SoulCycle continued to prove exceptionally popular with U.S. fitness fanatics in 2014, but Zumba may have peaked.

According to lifestyle tracking app MyFitnessPal, which analyzed data from its 47 million users, the average minutes logged at SoulCycle - the famed boutique cycling studio - jumped by 78per cent compared to 2013.

Zumba, a Latin-dance-centered exercise program which boasts eight million weekly participants, suffered an eight per cent drop in minutes logged by MyFitnessPal's users.

SoulCycle, which boasts an astonishing retention rate of 85per cent, launched in 2006 and only has 26 locations in the U.S. so far, but it's growing fast, with plans to expand to London this year.

Essentially a mixture of the hard-core aerobic spinning set to ear-splitting loud chart tunes, the workout has quickly gained an impressive list of celebrity followers after its inception.

Jennifer Lawrence, Olivia Wilde, Lady Gaga, Katy Perry and Alessandra Ambrosio have all hopped onto SoulCycle's stationary bikes, with sessions priced at a hefty $34 for 45 minutes.

Zumba has been around longer, since 2001, and by its own figures the number of weekly classes actually rose by 14per cent.

Spokeswoman Allison Robins told The Wall Street Journal that MyFitnessPal's eight per cent drop may not mean Zumba is losing popularity.

'Once [participants] create a habit, they don’t see a need to continue logging in,' she suggested.

Zumba, which counts celebrity fans including Jennifer Lopez, Stacy Keibler and Giuliana Rancic, is still a lot more popular than CrossFit for example - a strength and conditioning program that launched in 2002.

MyFitnessPal users logged ten times as many minutes last year doing Zumba than CrossFit.

Branded exercise classes as a category have been proving very popular overall, with people increasingly opting for short, high-intensity workouts.

Minutes logged taking part in body-toning ballet-style workouts were up 46per cent from 2013, with programs including Pure Barre gaining a rapid following.

Several Victoria's Secret Angels this year including Lily Aldridge and Doutzen Kroes credited Ballet Beautiful - the ubiquitous ballet program led by Mary Helen Bowers - with toning them up before December's VS Fashion Show.

As for fitness-tracking itself, sales of wearable devices such as Fitbit and Jawbone increased 141per cent between 2013 and 2014, according to NDP industry analyst Ben Arnold. 

May the New Year's resolutions commence!
