This is the terrifying moment a teen robber holds up a shop at gunpoint - all for 24 cans of beer.

George Banister, 19, pulled the weapon on the horrified shop keeper in the West End of Newcastle.

He then threatened to shoot shopkeeper Mohammed Rafiq, who bravely chased the teen out of his shop.

The thug later posted a picture of himself posing in a mask and holding the gun on Facebook.

Banister was a known offender in the area and admitted robbery and a series of other assaults at Newcastle Crown Court. He was jailed for 6 years.

Sending him to a young offender 
institution, Judge Brian Forster QC told him: 'You pulled an imitation 
weapon and threatened to shoot the shop owner and you later boasted 
about it on Facebook.

'The courts have to protect local shopkeepers and deter people from behaving in the way you behaved.

'You answer for terrifying repeated acts of violence and you show no regard for other members of the community.'

The court heard how Banister and another 17-year-old went into Fenham Discount Store about 5pm on August 9.

The youth then stole a pack of 24 cans of lager and left the shop, moments before Banister came in pointing a gun at the shopkeeper.

Despite chasing the raider out of his shop, he was unable to get the stolen beer back.

Two
 hours after the robbery Banister was bragging on Facebook about having 
committed it, wearing a mask and posing with the BB gun he used in the 
raid.

Caroline McGuirk, prosecuting, said: 'The defendant threatened to shoot the shop owner, who nevertheless pursued him.

'Mr
 Rafiq said he was very scared when the weapon was pointed at him but he
 felt he couldn’t let them get away with it so he chased them.

'He says the incident has caused him a lot of stress, harassment and fear.'

This is not the only of Banister's shocking crimes.

Last January Banister assaulted Abigail Pollard, who hours later tragically hanged herself.

Abigail had been fighting with another woman outside Switch bar, in Newcastle, when Banister waded in, attacking both.

He punched the other woman in the face twice then dragged Abigail across the road and kicked and stamped on her head.

Miss
 McGuirk said: 'Later that day she hanged herself. She visited a place 
where a family member had committed suicide a year before and, using the
 same tree, she hanged herself.

'There is no direct evidence to say this assault contributed but it can’t have helped her state of mind.'

In July Banister got involved in another fight between two women on Adair Avenue, Benwell.

He racially abused one of the women, spat at her and punched her in the head.

When the other woman asked who he thought he was, Banister replied: 'I’m George Banister, you have some ammonia', and threw the burning substance in her face.

Banister was involved in more city centre violence in December last year when he and another attacked several men in an unprovoked attack outside Sinner’s Bar.

And while under arrest at North Tyneside police station, Banister bit a detention officer’s hand.

Banister, of no fixed address, who already had 39 previous convictions, admitted robbery, possessing an imitation firearm, six assaults and racially aggravated assault. 

The youth who stole the beer got an absolute discharge at magistrates court for theft.
