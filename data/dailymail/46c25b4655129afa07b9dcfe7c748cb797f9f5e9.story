A terrified recluse was battered to death for pleasure after his next door neighbour recruited a psychopathic bully to 'rough him up' over a debt of just £100.

Christopher Dawson, 44, from Gorton, Manchester, was petrified because he owed the cash to John Ashton and even went to the police over fears he would be assaulted.

But partially sighted Ashton, 54, found out about the complaint and subsequently enlisted the help of Sean Collier, 21, to beat up Mr Dawson and 'teach him a lesson.'

Collier, however, went too far with his fists and subjected Mr Dawson, who weighed just seven stone, to a frenzied beating before strangling him at his flat.

In the aftermath of the assault, Ashton went to check on Mr Dawson, only to find his room had been ransacked, picture frames had been knocked off the walls and smashed, and other items of furniture had been upturned.

He then discovered the battered victim lying on the floor at the side of his bed with blood covering his face.

When he realised Mr Dawson was dead, Ashton told neighbours: 'I didn’t want to get him killed I just wanted him to give him a crack - I can’t believe he actually killed him.'

Collier himself was arrested after boasting to pals of the 'buzz' he got from killing the vulnerable victim.

The 21-year-old admitted murder at Manchester Crown Court and was jailed for life with a minimum term of 23 years.

Too far: Collier went to Dawson's home in Gorton, Manchester, to 'rough him up', but ended up subjecting him to a frenzied beating, leaving him covered in bruises

Scene: After the attack, Ashton went to check on Mr Dawson and found the victim's body on the floor of the property with blood covering his face

Ashton was jailed for four years after he was found guilty of conspiracy to commit assault.

The
 tragedy occurred last year after Mr Dawson fell foul of Ashton - who 
was known as 'Blind John' in his neighbourhood due to a degenerative eye
 condition.

On the night of 
the attack a number of people including Collier had been drinking in the
 communal kitchen at the flats where Mr Dawson lived.

Mr
 Dawson spoke to the people then went upstairs to his own flat - but 
hours later noises were heard coming from his room, similar to that of 
furniture being moved.

A 
short time after the brutal incident, Collier kicked in the front door 
of his own home - a few doors away and was seen to look agitated.

Another neighbour asked him what was wrong and Collier said that he had 
had a scuffle with 'a lad from a few doors down.'

The next day, Ashton checked on Mr Dawson and made the grisly 
discovery. He asked other neighbours to check on the dead man before 
police were called.

Duncan 
Thorpe from Great Manchester Police’s Major Incident Team, said: 'Mr 
Dawson had suffered multiple injuries including bruising to his neck and
 larynx, fractured ribs and injuries to his head and face.

'He had clearly suffered a very violent and sustained attack.

'Ashton has always denied his involvement and asking Collier to assault Dawson to teach him a lesson.

'Only Collier knows the real reason why he subjected Mr Dawson to such a horrific assault that day and he will spend the rest of his life living with the consequences of his actions.

'Both men are now deservedly serving considerable sentences in custody.'

Case: Collier was jailed given a life sentence at Manchester Crown Court after admitting the murder of Christopher Dawson while Ashton was jailed for four years for conspiracy to commit assault
