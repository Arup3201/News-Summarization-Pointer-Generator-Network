A dangerous driver who led police on a 90mph chase through winding country lanes was finally caught after he crashed into a school bus.

James Poole, 20, raced through streets, dodged oncoming traffic and forced other drivers to swerve out of his way.

He jumped red lights and sped along the wrong side of the road in a bid to shake off police officers who were pursuing him, a court heard.

A dangerous driver who led police on a 90mph chase was finally caught - after he crashed into a school bus

But he was finally caught after he tried to squeeze between a school bus stopped at traffic lights and an oncoming lorry and hit the bus.

A judge jailed Poole for 22 months and handed him a three-year driving ban.

Prosecutor Edward Phillips told Southampton Crown Court in Southampton, Hants, officers in a patrol car captured the chase on film.

PC Mark Bailey was driving an unmarked police car southbound on the M3 near Winchester, Hampshire, and spotted a grey BMW undertaking another car.

Video footage played to the court showed Poole then returning to the outside lane before undercutting other vehicles.

The officer then turned on his blue lights and sirens, but Poole ignored it and carried on, accelerating to reach speeds of up to 90mph.

He then careered off the motorway at Winchester and hurtled down a B road.

Officers kept up a running commentary to the police control room as Poole made no attempt to slow down but continued to overtake vehicles at speed.

At one point, he crossed double white lines on a blind bend and also jumped village traffic lights at 60mph.

Poole, who had passengers in the BMW, ignored 'keep left' bollards and forced oncoming motorists to pull over to avoid a crash, the court heard.

But the pursuit ended when he tried to squeeze between stationary cars and oncoming traffic at a junction and crashed into a school bus.

His passengers ran off but Poole, of no fixed abode, was arrested sitting in the driver’s seat.

He admitted using a vehicle without insurance, driving a vehicle without a licence, two counts of theft, and one count of dangerous driving.

Recorder Nigel Lickley QC, sentencing, said Poole showed a complete disregard for the safety of other drivers and his passengers.

Mr Lickley said: 'This case clearly crosses the custody threshold and a suspended sentence is not appropriate.

'You were very fortunate nobody was seriously injured.'

Nichola Attwood, mitigating, said Poole had reached a crossroads in his life and realised he had to change his ways.
