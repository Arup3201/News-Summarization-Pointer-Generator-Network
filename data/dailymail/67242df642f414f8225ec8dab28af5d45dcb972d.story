Three weeks from now they are supposed to be the dream team that will lead America to victory at the Ryder Cup. But Phil Mickelson and Keegan Bradley didn’t cover themselves in glory yesterday when they withdrew before the start of the third round of the BMW Championship.

Twenty-four hours after declaring the Cherry Hills course an ‘extremely fun place to play’, Mickelson evidently decided he wasn’t having any fun at all after a second-round 76 left him well off the pace.

Players are not supposed to withdraw without good reason and the 44-year-old star attraction will surely be fined. ‘My primary goal is to rest and prepare for the Ryder Cup,’ he said in a prepared statement.

It brought an abrupt end to comfortably the worst season of Mickelson’s career, where the only top 10 was running Rory McIlroy close at the USPGA Championship.

After all those years of Tiger and Phil, this was the season their era came to an end, with neither winning on tour for the first time since 1992.

For those who remained, revitalised Spaniard Sergio Garcia headed into the third round with a one-stroke lead over American Ryan Palmer, with Rory McIlroy, his nemesis this summer, a further shot adrift.

Meanwhile, Graeme Storm will drive away from Switzerland tonight in a new BMW after a hole in one at the European Masters.

The Englishman, who is having such a dreadful year that he cannot afford to run a car, holed out with a six iron on the 11th at Crans-sur-Sierre on his way to a third-round 64 and a one-shot lead over Tommy Fleetwood.
