This letter was inside a book purchased at a Goodwill store in Florida

Fox reports that Rothurmel was a member of the African American WACS unit stationed at Love Field in Dallas

Army Sargent Albert Alm who was stationed in palm Springs, California sent the love letter in 1945.

Unfortunately Helen never got a chance to open her letter and Polk wants to giver her that nostalgic opportunity.

'Her life could have been changed from this one letter. You know, It is a personal sentimental thing. They do movies about lost love, and I'm thinking who knows what is in here that she has never seen? Who knows? I would love for her to get it,' said Polk.

So far the search for Helen Rothurmel has been an unsuccessful one despite several attempts to find her and contact her.

The post office tried to deliver the letter three times but it never arrived with Rothurmel.

Polk is determined nonetheless and is working with military officials to find Rothurmel and her family.

While the search continues, Polk will not open the letter. She wants to give that honor to the letter's rightful owner.

'It's a personal sentimental thing.' Polk told Fox.

'They do movies about lost love letters, and I am thinking who knows what's in here that she has never seen? I would love for her to get it.'

The letter dated all the way back to May 28 in 1945 during World War II
