A proposed new black and white flag for New Zealand has been compared to one that's flown by Islamic State militants.

British comedian John Oliver drew similarities between the new design and the infamous ISIS flag, saying it could lead to future awkward situations for New Zealand's Prime Minister John Key.

During his show on Sunday - Last Week Tonight with John Oliver - he continued to mock the proposed design, describing it as a 'flag of a vegetarian pirate ship'.

Oliver further attempts to imitate Key's New Zealand accent, after showing a clip of the re-elected Prime Minister vowing to hold a referendum to change the flag in 2015.

'Key is now back in office and ready to tackle the most pressing issues facing the country,' Oliver said.

'He wants to change the New Zealand flag, or as they call it there, the "fleg".

'Now why's he going to do this? Well one reason might be that it looks too much like Australia's flag.'

Another video is then shown of a radio interview with Key, who said: 'There's just a huge confusion factor...the number of times I'm in an international meeting and the number of times they sit me down in front of the Australian flag or the Australian area. It's not funny, it happens all the time.'

Oliver says if the proposed black and white New Zealand flag is approved, it could lead to future awkward situations for New Zealand's Prime Minister John Key

But Oliver warns of the repercussions of transforming New Zealand's predominately blue flag to the colours used by ISIS.

'If you think mistakenly being seated under the Australia's flag was bad, wait until they put you under the one for ISIS,' he said.

Instead Oliver puts forward his suggestions, including a bungy-jumping sheep, as an alternative.

The current New Zealand flag has the same Blue Ensign on the top left corner as Australia and is defaced with four red stars outlined in white representing the Crux Australis - also known as the Southern Cross.

Australia's flag has a large white seven-pointed star, known as the Commonwealth Star, under the Union Jack. The Southern Cross constellation on the flag is made up of five white stars.

The proposed new design has a silver fern which is the same trademark logo for the All Backs - New Zealand's beloved national rugby union team.
