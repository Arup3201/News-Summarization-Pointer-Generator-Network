A single mother of four has been forced to crowd-source funding so that she can build a 'bully fence' around her home, which has been pelted with eggs and animal faeces from neighbours tormenting her disabled teenage daughter.

Sophie Mason from Farmborough Heights in Wollongong, south of Sydney, says her 15-year-old daughter Faith is constantly bullied for having Downs Syndrome, with adults and children from the are calling the girl a 'retard'.

Now the mother has turned to the crowd-funding website gofundme.com to raise $700 for the materials to build a fence and plant protective trees on her home's exposed boundaries to put distance between her family and the neighbourhood bullies.

Ms Mason's family even had bicycles stolen and objects set on fire which were left to burn near the front door, reported the Illawarra Mercury.

'They're hurting my feelings,' the teenage blonde said, when asked about the constant attacks.

But Ms Mason's efforts to protect her family from the tormentors only seem to make matters worse.

'Now it's a challenge for them to see if they can make me cry,' she said.

'How do I explain this to [Faith]. She's a beautiful girl who doesn't deserve any of this - she hasn't got a nasty bone in her body. It's difficult because she can't go outside and play now.'

Ms Mason believes the tyrants who bully Faith are a group of 15 children and three adults from the neighbourhood

It was three years ago when Ms Mason and her four children moved into their Housing NSW property in Warrah Place.

At first the family enjoyed an amicable relationship with their neighbours, but it soon turned sour when Ms Mason objected to visiting children swearing and fighting in her house and refused to let them come over.

Ms Mason also believes her decision to home-school Faith's three siblings may also have contributed to making them targets for neighbourhood bullies.

These incidents were reported to police, but the Masons were told nothing could be done to stop them. So the mother of four took matters into her own hands.

The mother of four took to a crowd-sourcing site, gofundme.com, to raise money for a 'bully barrier' around their house

Ms Mason took to crowd-sourcing site gofundme.com last week to raise money for materials after the Department of Housing refused to build the barrier.

'I am raising money to build a bully barrier for my daughter,' she wrote on the website.

'She is an amazing, sparkling, funny young woman. But there are many who would rather tear her down rather than take the time to see how loving and special she is. We are living in an area with many not-so-nice people that are taking away Faith's confidence and her healing smiles. Almost daily she is called a retard and other nasty names. Our home is often pelted with eggs and other objects. We are trying to raise money to build a fence around our garden and plant some fruit trees (to block the missiles).'

It appears the mother's plea has touched the hearts of many as the campaign, which aimed to raise $700, had already climbed over $2,000 at the time of publication.

It has since gone up to $3,500 and continues to increase.

Ms Mason thanked the donors for their 'love and support'.

'The messages and support have given us fresh courage,' she said.
