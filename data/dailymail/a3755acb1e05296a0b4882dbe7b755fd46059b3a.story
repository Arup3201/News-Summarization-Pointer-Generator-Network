Mario Gomez's predatory instincts and a late goal by substitute Juan Vargas ensured Fiorentina qualified for the Europa League semi-finals.

Fiorentina had one foot in the next stage of Europe's second tier cup competition thanks to Khouma Babacar's all-important away goal during the closing stages of last Thursday's first leg encounter in Kiev.

The Ukrainian outfit knew they were in for a hard task at the Stadio Artemio Franchi as they faced the likes of Mohamed Salah, Joaquin and Gomez.

Fiorentina ace Mario Gomez scored the opening goal of the game in the 43rd minute to help his side qualify

And their mission to seal a spot in the next round was made near enough impossible due to an incredibly rash decision by Swedish referee Jonas Eriksson. 

The Scandinavian official ruined Dynamo Kiev's hopes of upsetting the Viola by brandishing a red card in the direction of Holland international Jeremain Lens. 

Eriksson showed Lens a second yellow card as he decided to penalise the former PSV forward for diving inside the penalty area.

The wrong call was made as replays showed Lens was slightly clipped when he made his way towards goal. 

It was one of those occasions where the referee should have simply let play continue. 

Dynamo Kiev manager and former Tottenham striker Sergei Rebrov was forced into taking off striker Lukasz Teodorczyk moments before the interval, which subsequently minimised the away side's goal threat during the second half.

Salah, who has proven his doubters wrong since swapping Chelsea for Fiorentina in February, almost doubled his side's lead when he managed to jiggle his way past several defenders before shooting at goal.

The Egyptian international's shot appeared to be heading into the back of Oleksandr Shovkovskiy's net until Danilo used his hand to intercept.

Dynamo Kiev, despite their best efforts, failed to really threaten Fiorentina after being reduced to 10 men as Vincenzo Montella's side elected to play the passing game.

Late substitute Vargas put the result beyond doubt when he ran down the left wing before smashing the ball past Shovkovskiy.

Fiorentina will face either Napoli, Sevilla or Dnipro for a place in this year's Europa League final in Warsaw.
