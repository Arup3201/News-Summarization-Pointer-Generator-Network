Multi-millionaire founder: Michelle Mone has finally divorced her husband and won control of her company in a seven-figure take over deal

The multi-millionaire founder of lingerie empire Ultimo has finally divorced her husband and won control of her company in a seven-figure take over deal.

Michelle Mone, 41, whose marriage to Michael, 45, ended after more than 20 years together, finalised the buy-out of the business – estimated at £50 million - yesterday.

It is understood the couple’s divorce will be made official on Wednesday, completing a life-changing double for the bra tycoon who vowed never to work with her husband again after discovering he was allegedly in a relationship with one of the firm’s designers.

The businesswoman has always been the
public face of the business, MJM International, while Michael, an 
accountant, has been happy to remain in the background doing the 
finances and production element.

But
following their break-up in December 2011, it was reported a shocked 
Michelle discovered her estranged husband had one more share in the 
business than her – something sources close to her said she was having 
difficulty coming to terms with.

As
a power struggle within the company developed, she expressed concerns 
that big development plans she had ‘might all be for nothing’ because of
doubt over who would ultimately gain control.

But
The Scottish Mail on Sunday can now reveal the paperwork which gives 
her a clean break professionally and personally from the man she alleges
cheated on her with former colleague, Samantha Bunn, 31, has now been 
signed.

The deal gives her complete control of the firm and secures jobs at the company headquarters in East Kilbride, Lanarkshire.

Last night, a source told MoS: ‘Michelle is absolutely ecstatic it’s all over and that she has saved the company and the jobs of her employees which looked in doubt at one point. Ultimo is her baby and she has big plans for it now it belongs to her alone.’

The couple, whose luxury home in Thorntonhall, Lanarkshire, is also up for sale, married in 1991 when Michelle was just 19.

It comes as the identity of Samantha Bunn is revealed after apparently being fired by the blonde Ultimo boss.

Pictured at a wedding dressed as a 
bridesmaid, brunette Bunn looks nothing like Mone but is said to have 
been pictured arriving at a hotel with Mone's husband after she hired a 
private investigator to follow them.

She had been working for beer firm Labbatts and the couple grew their empire from a room in their former home. Michelle’s knack for PR saw some of the world’s most famous women become Ultimo models including Penny Lancaster, Rachel Hunter, and now Michael Buble’s wife Luisana Lopilato.

Her own profile rose with TV appearances on Masterchef, The Apprentice and reality show 71 Degrees North. She’s now one of the UK’s most successful businesswomen and was awarded an OBE in 2010.

Friends and family were shocked when she and her husband announced they were parting, claiming no other parties were involved.

Michelle Mone, pictured here unveiling the new Ultimo lingerie range at Frasers in Glasgow last month, says she is passionate about the brand, which she describes as her 'baby'

Last year, she revealed how she had cried herself to sleep every night after discovering Michael had begun a relationship.

In an interview, when asked if she had an all-time career ‘low’, she replied: ‘My husband going away with my designer. You have to trust your team but there was a lot of deceit and lies – it changed the whole company. If you remain positive, you will get through things and as long as you’re a good, honest person you’ll be okay.’

Michael, who rarely comments, has denied cheating on her and is reported to have said: ‘There was no affair and what is happening now is private.’

He added: ‘Prior to our split, there was no relationship. If anyone is saying that is the reason for the split, that is untrue.’

Yesterday, the entrepreneur declined to comment when contacted by MoS.

Last night, Mr Mone was unavailable for comment.
