West Brom have signed striker Brown Ideye from Dynamo Kiev for a club-record £10million fee.

The 25-year-old joins the Baggies on a three-year deal, having agreed personal terms before passing his medical on Friday, and can stay for a fourth if the club wish to exercise that option.

Ideye, overlooked by Nigeria manager Stephen Keshi for the summer's World Cup squad, will wear the No. 9 shirt and said: 'Done deal, officially a West Bromwich Albion player, thank you God.'

You may not know an awful lot about West Brom's new signing, but he's been about.

Ideye's statistics tell all. He's a clinical striker - strong and powerful - although it's difficult to compare the Ukrainian Premier League to that of England.

Nevertheless, 33 goals in 74 Dynamo Kiev matches is by no means a bad return.

West Brom clearly believe in the 25-year-old - £10million is a hefty sum after all - and he will have to repay their faith.

Ideye, who took to Twitter to announce the move, continued: 'Dream come true... EPL.

'Would like to thank my family and my agents, Hootan Ahmadi and Ali Barat, for a job well done.

'Big thanks to everyone who made this possible.'

West Brom manager Alan Irvine, having made his fifth signing of the summer, said: 'Brown is a quality striker and I'm looking forward to working with him.

'He's
 a strong, quick, powerful player who likes to get in behind defences 
and has plenty of Champions League and international experience.'

Technical
 director Terry Burton added: 'When I arrived at Albion the recruitment 
department flagged Brown up as the man at the top of their wish list.

'It is a fantastic signing because of the quality and the potential of the player.

'I can see that he really wants to be here and that he really wants to be playing in the Premier League.

'He’s a dynamic player who likes to get in behind defenders and he has the pace to do so.

'He gets himself into good scoring positions in the box and if there are opportunities then he will get on the end of them.

'We’re looking forward to seeing him play for the club and scoring goals.'
