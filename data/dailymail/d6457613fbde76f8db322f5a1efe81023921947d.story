A student at an elite all-boys high school has been advised not to bring his chosen partner to the Year 12 formal because it is another boy.

The student from Brisbane's Anglican Church Grammar School, also known as Churchie, was told to 'keep with school' tradition' and bring a female date to the senior formal in June, the Courier Mail reports.

Headmaster Dr Alan Campbell said the formal was a social opportunity for male students to learn how to 'mix and mingle' with 'ladies' and the school had a strong preference they bring a female date.

'We want young men to learn from and interact with young ladies so these opportunities are very important in providing a well-rounded education,' Dr Campbell said. 

It isn't the first time the school has advised students against bringing their gay partners.

Several students raised the issue back in 2008 but were told to bring members of the opposite sex.

The headmaster at the time, Jonathan Hensman, told the Courier Mail the issue hadn't come up before, but was expected because of the 'changing times'.

'Not all students take their girlfriends. Some take a female friend. It's about protocols and decorums,' Mr Hensman said.

But the Anglican school isn't alone, with the Queensland Catholic Education Commission saying they had similar models of behaviour in their schools. 

Queensland’s Anti-Discrimination Commissioner Kevin Cocks encouraged schools to be accepting. 

'I would encourage schools to be inclusive and be supportive of students at this very difficult time of their life,' he told the newspaper.

Dr Campbell said the school's governing body would not oppose a student's choice of guest but the school's guidelines and recommendations remained the same. 

'I think in the end, it really is a decision that a young man would make with his parents and his family,' he said.
