Emily Otrando, 10,  of Rhode Island died last week

The 10-year-old girl who died from complications of an unusual respiratory virus that has been affecting children across the U.S. has been named as Emily Otrando of Rhode Island. 

The state Health Department said Wednesday the girl from Cumberland died last week of a staph infection associated with enterovirus 68, which it called 'a very rare combination.' 

It's unclear what role the virus played in the death, Health Director Michael Fine said. 

Fine said she was taken to Hasbro Children's Hospital in Providence when her parents noticed she was having trouble breathing and called 911.

He said the situation quickly 'became dire' and Emily died within 24 hours of arriving at the hospital.

He said she did not have any previous infections or an underlying disease.

Cumberland Schools Superintendent Philip Thornton said in an email to the school community Wednesday that school leaders were 'misinformed' by the Health Department when they told last week in 'straight and clear terms' that their student did not have the enterovirus.

Health Department spokeswoman Christina Batastini said health officials would not have told the school that because they did not have the test results until this week.

She was remembered in a family obituary as a sweet child who loved animals and Harry Potter.   

She wanted to grow her hair long to look like her favorite Harry Potter character, Luna Lovegood.

Emily attended Community School and was a Girl Scout, according to the obituary.

She loved to write stories and go to the beach with her family. 

She had a dog, Lola, and a fish, Rainbeau, but she always asked for a new pet on trips to the pet store with Grammy.

'Emily was a sweet, loving, beautiful child who found joy in life and nature,' the obituary said.

It is currently unclear what role the virus played in Emily's death, Health Director Michael Fine said Wednesday

The virus was also found in three other patients who died in September, according to theU.S. Centers for Disease Control and Prevention. 

The CDC declined to release any other details about those deaths.

Enterovirus D68 is one of more than 100 non-polio enteroviruses, a group of viruses that cause 10 million to 15 million infections in the United States each year. 

The government says enterovirus 68 has sickened at least 500 people in 42 states and the District of Columbia.  

Sweeping the nation: The CDC has been testing a limited number of specimens from very sick children around the country, and as of Thursday reported 277 people in 40 states and the District of Columbia with enterovirus 68

In Colorado U.S. health officials are investigating at least 10 cases of children who developed limb weakness or paralysis after testing positive for the respiratory virus.

EARLY SYMPTOMS: 

The virus beings like the common cold and may include sneezing, a runny nose and a cough. 

This is all that happens for most people who catch an enterovirus, especially adults. 

Children, especially with asthma, are more susceptible to catching a more severe form of the illness. 

At the beginning it's almost impossible to tell the difference between enterovirus 68 and a common cold. 

If a child develops a rash, a fever, or has difficulty breathing, parents should seek medical attention as soon as possible.

Dr. Larry Wolk, chief medical officer of the Colorado Department of Public Health and Environment, said some of the children have been ruled out for Enterovirus D68 infection and others are awaiting test results.

All of those experiencing limb weakness have recently been diagnosed with either some form of enterovirus or rhinovirus, two large classes of common viruses that cause respiratory infections. The common cold, for example, is caused by a rhinovirus.

'Just because it's not specific for D68 doesn't mean it's not another, similar virus,' Wolk said.

'There is a very high number of kids who have viral respiratory illness this time of year,' he said, adding that limb paralysis is 'a rare complication of all of these viruses.'

The CDC is investigating the cases and asking other states whether they are also are seeing higher than normal cases of limb weakness associated with a respiratory virus infections, according to its website.

'It's obviously not just D68 in and of itself,' Wolk said. 'The question is, is there something else that ties these 10 cases together.'

All of the children in the Colorado cluster are under 21, and most live in the Denver area. 

Of those involved, six have been discharged from the hospital. Nine of the 10 were treated at Children's Hospital Colorado in Aurora.

Magnetic resonance imaging (MRI) scans of all 10 cases show lesions in the spinal column. Symptoms range from weakness in arms or legs to total paralysis of a limb, Wolk said.

The CDC said it is focusing its testing efforts on cases in which people develop severe respiratory illness, although it is likely that many more people with milder symptoms are infected with the virus. 

Bed ridden: 13-year-old Will Cornejo is recovering at Rocky Mountain Hospital for Children at Presbyterian/St. Luke's Medical Center in Denver earlier this month from what doctors suspect is enterovirus 68

Melissa Lewis, of Denver, helps her son, Jayden Broadway, 9, as he coughs in his bed at the Children's Hospital Colorado where he was treated for the enterovirus 68 and released, but his asthma made the illness more difficult to fight
