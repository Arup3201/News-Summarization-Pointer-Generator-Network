A controversial work of art featuring lights which switch on and off every 30 seconds has proved to be the ultimate turn-off after it failed to sell at a Christie’s auction.

The Mail on Sunday revealed last month that Christie’s was offering Turner Prize-winning artist Martin Creed’s Work No 127: The Lights Going On And Off for up to £70,000.

It created a mock-up of the installation, but would-be buyers were told they would not be purchasing bulbs or electrical wiring.

British artist Martin Creed's Work No 127, which consists of light bulbs being turned on (above) and off, was expected to fetch £70,00 when it was put up for auction with Christie's in London - but failed to sell

Would-be buyers were told they would not get the bulbs or switches needed to recreate the piece but would instead receive a certificate giving permission for use of the idea. Pictured: The lights 'off' in the artwork

Instead they would be the proud owner of a certificate, giving them the right to recreate the work in their home.

But no one bought the piece in Christie’s record-breaking Post-War and Contemporary auction on Tuesday, which generated nearly £100 million in sales.

Last night both Martin Creed and Christie’s were unavailable for comment.
