Daniel Sturridge poked fun at his Liverpool team-mate Jordan Henderson on Instagram for his 'woman's face' when celebrating against Southampton.

The Liverpool striker shared an image of him celebrating his winning goal against Southampton at Anfield with Henderson.

In reference to Henderson's reaction, Sturridge added the caption: 'The face ladies make when they've not seen their best friend for yonks... "Hey girl" queue the fake/awkward scream. Maybe a few jumps involved too...'

Sturridge flicked home a header from Raheem Sterling in the 79th minute to secure Liverpool a hard-fought three points against Southampton in their opening Barclays Premier League game.

The 24-year-old striker also scored the winner in Liverpool's opening game last season, a 1-0 win over Stoke at Anfield.

Henderson, meanwhile, delivered an inch perfect pass for Sterling to give Liverpool the lead in the 23rd minute.

But a spirited Southampton fightback saw them equalise through Nathaniel Clyne early in the second half for Ronald Koeman's side.

In the end, though, it was Liverpool who had the last laugh as Sturridge sealed a tough victory on a nervy afternoon at Anfield.

Liverpool now face back-to-back away trips to Manchester City and Tottenham in their next two Premier League outings.
