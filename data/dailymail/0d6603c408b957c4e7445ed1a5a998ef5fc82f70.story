Furious: Michael Gove, pictured entering Number 10 today, stepped up his criticism of Labour MPs in the wake of last week's Syria vote

Michael Gove today accused Labour MPs of behaving like fans at a ‘football match’ cheering at the result of the Commons vote against military action in Syria.

The Education Secretary condemned the Ed Miliband’s party for ‘celebrating’ at a time when ‘children had been killed by a ruthless dictator’.

But the bitter recriminations of the vote continued, with Labour claiming Mr Gove’s comments were ‘puerile, stupid and grossly offensive’.

The unexpected defeat by just 13 votes on Thursday night was the first time since 1782 that a government had lost a vote on war and peace.

In the corridors of Parliament afterwards Mr Gove, a staunch backer of military action in Syria, shouted 'you're a disgrace' at those MPs who opposed the Government in the tense vote.

Today the Cabinet Minister admitted he had become ‘heated’ but stepped up his criticism of the behaviour of Labour MPs.

There were cheers and shouts of ‘resign’ from the Labour benches as the result – 285 votes to 272 – was announced to a shocked House of Commons.

Mr Gove told BBC Breakfast: ‘I did become heated last week, that is absolutely right.

‘At the moment that the Government lost the vote on the motion, there were Labour MPs cheering as though it were a sort of football match and they had just won.

‘At the same time on the news, we were hearing about an attack on a school in Syria and the death toll there rising.

‘And the incongruity of Labour MPs celebrating as children had been killed by a ruthless dictator, I am afraid got to me and I did feel incredibly emotional. I do feel emotional about this subject.’

The remarks lay bare the depth of anger in the government at the way Labour approached the vote.

But Labour Party vice-chairman Michael Dugher said Mr Gove’s comments were ‘grossly offensive’.

‘Michael Gove's comments today are puerile, stupid & grossly offensive,’ the MP wrote on Twitter.

‘A desperate, low and partisan attack that demeans his office.’

Right behind you: Mr Gove, pictured in Downing Street with David Cameron today, insisted the Prime Minister had been right to rule out military action after the vote

Some 30 Tory rebels as well as nine Liberal Democrats joined with Labour to inflict a humiliating defeat on the Prime Minister.

A Government source branded Mr Miliband a ‘f****** c***’ and a 
‘copper-bottomed s***’ for demanding concessions from Mr Cameron and 
then voting against the watered down government motion.

Immediately after the vote the Prime Minister ruled out any British involvement in military action against Syria.

But in the days since there have been growing calls for a second Commons vote.

In the Commons today Foreign Secretary William Hague again insisted the government had no plans to return to Parliament on the issue.

But he stressed that Mr Cameron will pursue every possible option for Syria when he visits the G20 summit in Russia.

Mr Hague said the conflict in Syria would dominate the bi-lateral meetings between countries but it was up to the Russian government to set the agenda for multi-lateral talks, which will take place at the summit in St Petersburg on Thursday and Friday.

Speaking during Foreign Office questions in the House of Commons, Mr Hague also condemned the Syrian regime for preventing vital humanitarian aid from reaching Syrian refugees.

Recall: There were calls of 'resign' from the Labour benches before David Cameron told the Commons that Britain would play no part in military action against Syria

Labour’s shadow defence secretary Jim Murphy called on ministers to ‘spell out in what, if any, circumstances changes in Syria or internationally the Government would bring back to Parliament the issue of UK military involvement in Syria?’

But Defence Secretary Mr Hammond said: ‘It's a bit rich for you (Mr Murphy), who last week trooped into the lobbies behind your leader, giving rise to the very situation we now find ourselves in, to demand I tell you precisely in which circumstances we might revisit this issue.

‘I've said already we believe Parliament has spoken clearly on this issue and is unlikely to want to revisit it unless the circumstances change very significantly.’

Mr Obama today said he was confident that Congress would back his plan for intervention in Syria.

But he said he was ready to change the language of the motion to ensure it attracted widespread support.

The President said: 'So long as we 
are accomplishing what needs to be accomplished, which is to send a 
clear message to Assad, to degrade his capabilities to use chemical 
weapons, not just now but also in the future, as long as the 
authorization allows us to do that, I'm confident that we're going to be
able to come up with something that hits that mark.'

And Mr Obama insisted: 'This is not Iraq, and this is not Afghanistan.'

Meanwhile, French president Francoise Hollande said he would to wait for the US Congress decision on military action in Syria before deciding on any action France might take.
