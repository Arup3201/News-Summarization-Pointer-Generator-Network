The world is 'adrift' and America is in decline because of the 'extraordinary vacuum of leadership in this country,' New Jersey Gov. Chris Christie said Saturday.

'People both inside America and outside America no longer know what America stands for,' the outspoken politician told attendees of an Iowa GOP fundraiser, and that's because of 'the lack of leadership we have in the White House.'

'America is not being respected around the world the way we used to be and we’re not being respected because we longer mean what we say and say what we mean,' Christie, a probable 2016 presidential candidate, told a group of roughly 1,000 Republicans at a party for Iowa Gov. Terry Branstad's birthday.

The five-term governor's birthday is not for several weeks but he celebrated early this year, turning the annual affair into a fundraiser for his reelection campaign.

Party faithful and candidates in the midwestern state's midterm elections gathered at the 7 Flags Event Center in Clive, Iowa, on Saturday evening to fete Branstad, the state's longest serving governor - and to see Christie, the event's special guest. 

Fresh off a speech in Washington, D.C. this week in which he threw caution to the wind and proclaimed that 'it's time to start offending' people, Christie traveled to Iowa today, a key presidential primary state, to stump for conservative firebrand Steve King and attend Branstad's birthday bash.

At a fundraiser for King in Akron on Saturday afternoon, Christie endorsed the Republican congressman and encouraged Iowans to elect more lawmakers who aren't shy about sharing their convictions.

'One of the things that Steve and I share is an absolute commitment to speaking our mind,' Christie said, according to Iowa's KTIV News Channel 4.

'And I think that would be a good thing no matter what office you're running for,' he added. 'Speaking your mind is something that people of this country want more of. 

Christie said that people are not always 'going to agree with you' but 'fact is, if they know where you stand, that's the most important thing.'

Though he has not officially declared his candidacy for president, Christie, now in his second term as governor of New Jersey, is widely expected to seek the Republican nomination to the presidency in 2016. 

Speaking about a potential campaign today in Akron, Christie said, 'I've got a lot to work on before I worry about that decision and a day job that keeps me fairly busy,' according to KTIV.

Christie acknowledged today that he's 'considering' a run in 2016 while continuing to claim that he hasn't made a decision yet. 'When I do, I will certainly let everybody know,' he noted.

At tonight's event in the Des Moines suburb Christie seemed every bit the presidential candidate, however.

Flanked by two bulky security guards, Christie hung out near the stage after the evening's official program ended and took photos with dozens of well-wishers, desperate to snatch a moment of his time.

After MailOnline attempted to get in on the action and ask the governor a question, a handler for the usually approachable governor intervened and said his boss wouldn't be speaking to press that evening.

'He's working the crowd right now,' the Christie aide told MailOnline bluntly as the governor moved away to take another photo.

Also in attendance at the governor's birthday party tonight was Iowa Senate candidate Joni Ernst, a state lawmaker competing to represent Iowa in the U.S. Senate.

In her remarks she teased Christie about his possible presidential campaign and told him, 'It's so nice to have you back in Iowa.' 

'Maybe you'll be making some more trips to Iowa soon. I don't know, what do you think?' the Des Moines Register says Ernst playfully asked Christie.

Christie has already been to Iowa three times this election cycle and he announced tonight that he'll be making a fourth trip to the Hawkeye State next week on Thursday.

'Folks ask me why I'm coming to Iowa so much,' Christie said. 'Well, it's because Terry Branstad asked me to come to Iowa, and when Terry Branstad asks you to come to Iowa, you do not say no. Definitely not.'

If Christie wants to win over Iowa voters, he'll have to work a lot harder to schmooze them before they convene their caucus early next year, a Des Moines Register/Bloomberg Politics poll taken this month shows. 

Of the 16 Republican possible Republican presidential candidates Iowans were asked about by the news publications, Christie ranked eighth.

The survey of likely Republican caucus goers also found that Christie has high unavailability ratings. Just 39 percent of the state's most zealous GOP voters said they viewed him favorably. 

And while the New Jersey governor was better liked than Mike Pence of Indiana and John Kasich and Rob Portman of Ohio, he was the most disliked politician of the entire group of candidates tested.
