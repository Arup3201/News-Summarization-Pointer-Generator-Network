More than 65 business a day are being set up by single parents and the unemployed, under a government scheme to help families off benefits.

So far 46,000 businesses have been set up through the New Enterprise Allowance - including 2,000 a month  over the past year.

The government programme offers business mentoring and financial support for people on Jobseeker’s Allowance. Single parents and those on sickness benefits  also qualify for the Thatcherite scheme.

Employment Minister Esther McVey said the scheme was helping people become their own bosses after losing their jobs. She said Britain was built on small business success 

Special 'Apprentice' mentors help people  by providing advice on how to develop a business plan and get their new firm off the ground.

If the business plan is approved, people on the scheme are eligible for financial support payable through a weekly allowance for up to 26 weeks worth a total of £1,274. Participants can also get a businesses loan through a separate government start-up scheme.

Ministers released figures today to show that the scheme was being used by people of all ages. More than 10,000 businesses have been started by people aged over 50, according to the Government.

A further 3,370 firms have been set up by youngsters, while some 8,590 companies were started by people with disabilities.

Some of the businesses that have been set up include a college for children with learning difficulties, a vintage clothes shop and a gas engineering firm.

Mike Covell, 35, from Hull, used the scheme to launch a tour company in his home town. The 'Amazing Hull Tours' started last year and recounts the gruesome and darker side of the city's history, including Jack The Ripper.

He’s now secured film and reviewer roles and as a result of building his reputation, will be starring alongside Hollywood stars Mischa Barton and Jack O'Halloran in an historical film.

Hayley Thomas, 29, from Haverfordwest, West Wales, set up a children’s play centre after being made redundant.

The Government hopes TV shows like the Apprentice will inspire people who have lost their jobs to set up their own business rather than rely on benefits

The business gives parents the chance for a few hours to themselves on their Pembrokeshire holidays. She now employs 17 members of staff.

Employment Minister Esther McVey today hailed the scheme's success. 

She said: 'The continuing success of Great Britain is built on the hard work and ingenuity of small businesses up and down the country.

'It’s great that as part of the Government’s long-term economic plan we’ve been able to mentor tens of thousands of budding entrepreneurs to help make their dreams of becoming their own boss a reality. 

'As the economy continues to grow this new generation of entrepreneurs may well go on to create the jobs of tomorrow, helping even more people to get off benefits and build a career.'
