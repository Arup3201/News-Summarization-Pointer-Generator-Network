Rumble in the jungle: Controversy surrounding Nadine Dorries' Australian sojourn for 'I'm A Celebrity...Get Me Out Of Here!' continues to haunt her

Nadine Dorries is to be probed by the expenses watchdog over claims she received an undeclared fee for appearing on I’m a Celebrity... Get Me Out Of Here!.

The maverick Tory MP was the first to be voted off the reality TV programme when she featured as a contestant last year – without telling party officials first.

In November, she left behind her Mid Bedfordshire constituents in favour of a televised stay in the Australian jungle, causing much ill-feeling back home.

Miss Dorries has said she did not personally benefit from the appearance but agreed to obey a Commons ruling.

She insisted that she has yet to declare any payment in the Commons register of members’ interests, saying none was made to her.

Saying that she had a company, she added: 'When I benefit personally from that I will have to declare it to the register.'

Posting on Twitter, an indignant Miss
 Dorries wrote: 'LABOUR MP John Mann reported me to Standards 
Commissioner for undeclared earnings. Anything I earn, I declare 
IMMEDIATELY.'

She continued: 'If I haven't declared
 anything, it's because I haven't earnt anything. I must be the most 
hounded MP in Parliament.'

Miss Dorries defended herself by saying: 'I'm a backbencher, not a minister.

'My personal finances are my business and nobody else's and if I choose to take money from the company then I will declare it immediately to the standards commissioner.'

Payment argument: Miss Dorries insists that she did not 'benefit personally' from her star turn on I'm A Celebrity...Get Me Out Of Here!

Matthew Sinclair of the TaxPayers' Alliance said: 'It is absolutely right that MPs have to publicise any additional income they receive for other work. It helps constituents to make an informed judgement about their MP's performance at election time.'

'Mid Bedfordshire residents already have the right to feel let down after Nadine Dorries abandoned them for the jungle - but if she has failed to be straight about what she was paid for the caper, that will only add insult to injury.'

She is already under investigation by the Independent Parliamentary Standards Authority over expenses allegations.

The Conservative party suspended her in November but the party whip was returned to her in May.
