It is one of the world's most sophisticated software programmes, used to tap directly into the servers of Google, Apple, Microsoft and Facebook.

But it seems the sophistication behind the controversial U.S. data mining programme codenamed Prism does not extend to its logo.

A photograph of a prism used as the programme's logo was a free-to-use image taken by British historian and broadcaster Adam Hart-Davis, according to reports by Gawker.

The prism on the logo appears to be a close-up of Hart-Davis' picture that has then been inverted.

The bizarre origin of the photograph was uncovered after a company that produced tongue-in-cheek merchandise featuring Prism's logo was ordered to stop selling on copyright grounds.

However, it emerged that Hart-Davis, who offers some free-to-use scientific pictures on his website, took the image.

The picture, called Natural Science, shows the prism and refraction of light into a rainbow.

Mail Online has so far not been able to contact Hart-Davis.

The Eton-educated broadcaster, who is a distant relation of the Queen and David Cameron, is well known for his series of history programme, such as the BBC's What The Romans Did For Us and What The Tudors Did For Us.

In 2012, it emerged Hart-Davis had been 
warned about inappropriate touching by Glenwyn Benson, then the BBC 
controller in charge of commissioning factual programmes.

The
incident occurred when Mr Hart-Davis embraced a radio producer more 
than 30 years his junior. He said his gesture was misinterpreted.

The Prism scandal hit the headlines last week after documents were leaked to The Washington Post and The Guardian.

The particulars of the PRISM data-mining programme have been outlined in a top-secret PowerPoint presentation for senior intelligence analysts, which ended up being leaked

It
was revealed that the programme allowed the U.S. National Security 
Agency and FBI to tap directly into the servers of major internet 
companies.

It was 
approved by a judge in a secret court order and allowed the government 
to seize actual conversations in emails, video chats, instant messages 
and more.

Director of national intelligence 
James Clapper said the programme, authorised in the USA Patriot Act, has
been in place since 2008, the last year of the George Bush 
administration, and 'has proven vital to keeping the nation and our 
allies safe.'

'It continues to be one of our most important tools for the protection of the nation's security,' he said.

According to information declassified
today, the government does not unilaterally obtain information from the
servers of U.S. electronic communication service providers.

It requires approval from a Fisa 
Court judge and is conducted with the knowledge of the provider and 
service providers supply information when legally required to do so.

The government cannot target anyone 
under the programme unless there is an 'appropriate, and documented, 
foreign intelligence purpose' for the acquisition.

The NSA said the programme is 'one of its most important tools for the protection of the nation's security'

Apple said it had never heard of the PRISM programme but reports say it contributed to discussions with the government concerning sharing information

Those purposes include prevention of terrorism, hostile cyber activities or nuclear proliferation. The foreign target must be reasonably believed to be outside the United States. It cannot intentionally target any U.S. citizen or any person known to be in the U.S.

The Post and the Guardian cited confidential slides and other documents about Prism for their reports. They named Google, Facebook, Microsoft, Apple, Yahoo, AOL and Paltalk as companies whose data has been obtained.

The companies have said they are not voluntarily handing over user data and have strongly denied newspaper reports indicating that Prism has opened a door for the NSA to tap directly on the companies' data centres whenever the government pleases.

Amid reports of government spying, Mr Obama assured Americans on Friday that 'nobody is listening to your telephone calls'.

What the government was doing, he said, was digesting phone numbers and the durations of calls, seeking links that might 'identify potential leads with respect to folks who might engage in terrorism'.
