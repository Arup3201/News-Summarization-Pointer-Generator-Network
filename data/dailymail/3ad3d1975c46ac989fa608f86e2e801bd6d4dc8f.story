Hardened plaque discovered on the teeth of 1,000-year-old human skeletons has revealed the world's oldest case of gum disease

Described as a 'microbial Pompeii',  the plaque preserved bacteria and microscopic particles of food on the surfaces of teeth, effectively creating a mineral tomb for microbiomes.

And it revealed that our ancestors had gum disease that was caused by the same bacteria that plagues modern man, despite major changes in diet and hygiene.

Hardened plaque discovered on the teeth of 1,000 year old human skeletons has revealed not only their diets but the diseases they faced

They found that the ancient human oral microbiome already contained the basic genetic machinery for antibiotic resistance over eight centuries before the invention of antibiotics in the 1940s.

DNA testing of the tartar also showed some of the things ancient humans had been eating, such a vegetables, which do not show up in fossil records.

Gum disease is caused by a build-up of plaque on the teeth and is thought to affect over half of adults in the UK. 

Plaque is a sticky substance that contains bacteria and when it hardens it forms tartar.

Unlike bone, which rapidly loses much of its molecular information when buried, calculus grows slowly in the mouth and enters the soil in a much more stable state, helping it to preserve biomolecules.

Analysing this wealth of data required overcoming the major challenge of sorting and identifying millions of genetic sequences - like puzzle pieces - to reconstruct the complex biology of the ancient mouth> Pictured here is the process of isolating ancient DNA from plaque

Studying
 ancient teeth may help dentists discover the evolution of the human 
mouth bacteria and the origins of periodontal (gum) disease, the researchers said.

Although
 common in humans, domestic pets, and zoo animals, periodontal disease 
does not typically develop in wild animals, leading to speculation that 
it is an oral microbiome disease resulting from modern human lifestyles.

But these teeth revealed that our ancestors had gum 
disease that was caused by the same bacteria that plagues modern man, 
despite major changes in diet and hygiene.

Severe
gum disease is linked to diverse systemic diseases, including 
cardiovascular disease, stroke, pulmonary disease, and type II diabetes.

Researchers from the University of York, along with Swiss and Danish colleagues, said studying plaque will be more important than teeth in discovering the lifestyles of our past ancestors.

It has enabled scientists to analyse ancient DNA that was not destroyed when the skeleton was buried.

The study published in Nature Genetics revealed the one ancient human mouth, found in Dalheim, Germany, carried numerous opportunistic pathogens.

Professor Matthew Collins, of the University of York, said: ‘We knew that calculus preserved microscopic particles of food and other debris but the level of preservation of biomolecules is remarkable.

‘A microbiome entombed and preserved in a mineral matrix, a microbial Pompeii.

‘As we learn more about the evolution of this microbiome in response to migration and changes in diet, health and medicine, I can imagine a future in which most archaeologists regard calculus as more interesting than the teeth themselves.’

Professor Christian von Mering at the SIB Swiss Institute of Bioinformatics added: ‘Dental calculus is a window into the past and may well turn out to be one of the best-preserved records of human-associated microbes.’

The pioneering research applied shotgun DNA sequencing to dental calculus for the first time.

The teeth were taken from skeletons found at a site in Dalheim, Germany

Shotgun sequencing, also known as shotgun cloning, is a method used for sequencing long DNA strands.

During shotgun sequencing, DNA is broken up randomly into numerous small segments, which are sequenced.

The idea is to pepper the DNA with sequence reads such that they overlap, and when assembled, yield thecomplete sequence of the clone.

Shotgun sequencing was one of the precursor technologies that was responsible for enabling full genome sequencing.

The study involved sorting and identifying millions of genetic sequences like puzzle pieces in order to reconstruct the complex biology of the ancient oral microbiome.

It reconstructed the genome of a major periodontal pathogen and produced possibly the first genetic evidence of dietary biomolecules to be recovered from ancient dental calculus.

Dr Christina Warinner of the University of Zurich added: ‘Dental calculus acts both as a long-term reservoir of the oral microbiome and as a trap for dietary and environmental debris.

‘This allows us to investigate health and disease, as well as reconstruct aspects of an individual's life history and activities. Never before have we been able to retrieve so much information from one small sample.’

Studying ancient teeth may help dentists discover the evolution of the human mouth bacteria and the origins of periodontal disease, the researchers.

Although common in humans, domestic pets, and zoo animals, periodontal disease does not typically develop in wild animals, leading to speculation that it is an oral microbiome disease resulting from modern human lifestyles.

Severe periodontal disease is linked to diverse systemic diseases, including cardiovascular disease, stroke, pulmonary disease, and type II diabetes.
