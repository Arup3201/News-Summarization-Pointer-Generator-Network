Paul Scholes has empathised with Steven Gerrard following his announcement to leave Liverpool at the end of the season.

Despite a long list of honours with the Reds - including an heroic Champions League victory against AC Milan in Istanbul in 2005 - Gerrard has his critics for having never lifted a Premier League trophy with his boyhood club.

Speaking with The Independent on Saturday, former Manchester United midfielder Scholes revealed his thoughts on the Liverpool captain leaving behind a 17-year professional career at Anfield without winning a domestic league title.

'It's difficult for me, as a United fan, to say it's a pity that Gerrard has never won the league. It is easier to say he deserves to have a league winners' medal,' Scholes said. 

The 40-year-old also aired his views about Gerrard's admirable loyalty to the club hindering his chances of league success.

'If there was a time to leave Liverpool and join another club, he should have gone to Chelsea when they tried to sign him for the second time after he won the Champions League in 2005.

'It always looked like Chelsea would win the league more than once,' he added. 

Considering Chelsea's two successful campaigns in England's top flight since that memorable night in Istanbul - in 2005-06 and 2009-10 - Scholes was pragmatic in his approach.

'There are those who say it would have been worth less with Chelsea. I disagree. 

'Moving clubs is part of football. I was lucky that my club were strong enough that I could fulfil my ambitions there. 

'I wonder if part of his decision to leave Liverpool now was that, compared with last season, the club look much further away from the league title.'
