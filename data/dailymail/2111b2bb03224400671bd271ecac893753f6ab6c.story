It is the most romantic moment a couple and experience and this photographer loves to capture it on camera.

New York City-based Vlad Leto is allowed to share that special moment, by snapping couples as a secret paparazzi-style engagement photographer.

'Taking these pictures, I feel almost the same emotions as the couple,' explains the wedding and engagement specialist.

From Central Park to on stage, the 30-year-old graduate student has been hired over 200 times

The 30-year-old graduate student at the School of Visual Arts has found a unique way to both hone his craft and make ends meet - by working as a secret, paparazzi-style engagement photographer.

'I do proposal photography,' he explains in the video. 'Surprise, secret, covert proposal photography.' 

Having shot more than 200 proposals in the past three years, Vlad has plenty of tips and tricks for going undetected.

He uses a professional-grade Canon camera with a zoom lens to be able to stay out of sight of the couple.

In the video, Vlad profiles a young pair in New York's Times Square, only going over to introduce himself once the man had popped the question - and Leto had photographed the woman's surprised reaction.

Vlad says that shooting in such a way allows him to really feel the emotions of the couple 

He has photographed over 200 proposals at this point and charges up to $250 per session

'When a guy is going to propose to his girlfriend or to his boyfriend, he hires me,' he explains.

The video also shows off some of Vlad's most favourite shoots - such as a couple getting engaged on a bridge in a springtime park and a man asking for his boyfriend's hand on stage following a performance.

He charges $250 and up per shoot, and as well as the paparazzo photos, Vlad also shoots several more posed shots after he or she says 'yes.'
