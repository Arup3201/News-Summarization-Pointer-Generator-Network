A Spanish artist inspired by the artwork of Salvador Dali has transformed a dead sheep into a bedside table.

Oscar Tusquets created his new furniture collection as a tribute to the famous Spanish artist.

He denied his latest work was inspired by a means of helping being get to sleep counting sheep.

Oscar Tusquet's stuffed sheep table is part of a 21-piece collection in tribute to Spanish artist Salvador Dali. The £50,000 table and other limited edition pieces are on display in Barcelona

He said: 'We broke up the 
painting, "Interpretation Project for a stable-library", where there 
appears a characteristic Dali drawer, made up of a little lamp-table.'

Deyrolle, the taxidermist business from Paris that inspired Salvador Dali was also involved in creating the tables.

Many of Dali's pieces - bears, lions, lobster and swans, were linked in with Deyrolle.

Emile Deyrolle who died in 1917 was a French naturalist who took over his family taxidermy business that was opened on the rue du Bac in 1881.

It is still there to this day selling a wide variety of stuffed animals.

The bizarre table features a typical Dali drawer and bronze legs and is currently on display in Barcelona.

This sheep is part of a limited collection of 21 pieces - there were 20 white sheep and one black sheep with white legs, a reference to the popular Catalan expression 'a black sheep with white paws' meaning something that it is impossible.

The limited edition tables cost around £50,000 each.
