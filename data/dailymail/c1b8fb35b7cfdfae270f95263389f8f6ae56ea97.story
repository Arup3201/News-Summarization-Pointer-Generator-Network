Before Marilyn Monroe became famed for her platinum blonde locks, she set off to find stardom with her natural honey-hued hair.

And these are the photographs from Marilyn Monroe's first professional shoot that show off her natural beauty that consequently led her to celebrity status.

The photographs, of the then 19-year-old, are now to be sold after the legendary snapper Joseph Jasgur passed away.

First professional photoshoot: Marilyn Monroe, then called Norma Jeane, pictured by the late Joseph Jasgur when she was 19-years-old in West Hollywood

The pictures of the star, then called Norma Jeane, show the young hopeful in a side street, unrecognisable from the blonde bombshell she would become.

The photos, which are being sold with copyright and include many other snaps of the model, could fetch nearly a million dollars in the U.S. when they are sold.

Jasgur was commissioned in 1946 by the Blue Book agency to take pictures of various aspiring models, among them the brown-haired Norma Jeane Dougherty.

The pictures show her in a side street in West Hollywood behind Beverly Boulevard and she is wearing a jumper, black hat and is slightly plump in the face.

It was these snaps that Norma Jeane presented to Ben Lyon, the casting director at 20th Century Fox, who signed the wannabe and turned her into Marilyn Monroe.

The pictures are believed to give the
truest depiction of the woman who rose to the very summit of American 
society and died aged just 36.

There
are dozens of pictures of Monroe taken by Jasgur in the sale as well as
release forms signed by Monroe for her first assignments.

There
is also a letter from 1945 from Monroe to her half-sister saying how 
she wanted to become a model and that her then husband Jimmy was 
supportive.

Darren
Julien, of Julien's auction house in California in the US, which is 
selling the photos, said the archive was included in a huge sale of 
photographs.

He said: ‘Among the archive of Joseph Jasgur are the first pictures of Marilyn Monroe taken professionally.

Transformation: Marilyn after she morphed into a blonde bombshell

‘Jasgur
died about a year-and-a-half ago and his archive is being sold by the 
executor of his estate and these pictures come with copyright - it is a 
unique opportunity.

‘In 1946 the Blue Book agency commissioned Jasgur to take some pictures of their models.

‘He did some of them in a group together then did some individually of Norma Jeane, as she was known then.

‘These led to her career taking off and prove that the camera loved her before the world did.

‘The early photos are fascinating because they show Marilyn Monroe before she found fame and some shots so the confidence of later years and others reveal a more timid woman.

‘And the look is in contrast to the platinum blonde which is how people usually remember her. They were highly distributed so the pictures are not that well known.

‘Also in the sale are release forms signed by Marilyn and an important letter to her sister telling how she wanted to be a model.

‘We expect the archive to go for anywhere between $200 and a million dollars.’

The sale is on December 1-2.
