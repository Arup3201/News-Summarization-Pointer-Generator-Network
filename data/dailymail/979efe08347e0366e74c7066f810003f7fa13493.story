The Cleveland Browns football team announced today that they have reached an agreement on rookie quarterback Johnny Manziel's first contract.

The four-year deal is for $8.25 million dollars including a $4,318,000 signing bonus and $6,702,625 guaranteed.

It also includes a team option for a fifth year, reported Nate Ulrich of the Akron Beacon Journal after reading Spotrac's breakdown of the contract.

The former Texas A&M football star will compete against current starter Brian Hoyer in a fight to win the team's starting signal caller job.

Hoyer is coming off a torn ACL last season following three starts with the Browns in 2013.

The Bleacher Report writes that Manziel was projected as a top-five pick for sometime and that the Browns eventually decided he was too good to pass up so they traded No.22 for him.

There is a good chance that 'Johnny Football' will be able to start playing early on in his rookie season, maybe even in week one, reports The Bleacher Report.

The Cleveland Browns has been waiting for a big name like Manziel to lead their team's offense.

Manziel finished almost 70 per cent of his throws during two seasons as an Aggies' starter.

He was able to achieve 63 passing touchdowns and 30 rushing touchdowns over that time period.

His superior playing ability was enough for him to win the Heisman Trophy in 2012 and to gain the NFL's attention.

'This is a place I wanted to be. I didn't want to come in and just be mediocre. To have success, you need to come in and you need to do some good things.

That's more what I was talking about, than coming in and dominating as a rookie. It wasn't that talk at all. It was coming in, and trying to win some games if I'm going to be here and if I get the opportunity to play,' said Manziel to WKYC following the NFL draft.

Before Manziel was officially signed, there were some concerns from the team regarding his less-than average size and his behavior off the court.

The Bleacher Report writes that Manziel made a name for himself for amazing plays but that it's unclear as to whether he is consistent enough to lead an NFL team's offense.

Manziel also generated attention off the court  when 'drunken' pictures of him holding giant stacks of money surfaced.

Despite Manziel's controversial behavior, NFL player Joe Namath said he wants him on his team.

'I'd love him on my team, let me just say that.'

If Manziel plays like a star on the court he'll have less of a spotlight on his nights off during off-season.

The Bleacher Report calls Manziel 'more talented than Hoyer' and says he'll get his chance to play eventually.

The pressure is on for Manziel to perform well at the NFL training camp and prove that he is worthy of a leading spot on the Cleveland Browns.
