An armored car company's van was carrying nearly $1 million when it crashed on an icy road near Flint, Michigan on Tuesday morning, littering the road with some of the money on board.

Genesee County sheriff's Sgt. Pete Stocchi told The Flint Journal the van was being driven in Vienna Township when the driver lost control and crashed. The van, operated by Loomis, collided with another vehicle and spun around.

Some coins and cash spilled from the van onto the shoulder of the roadway and in a parking lot where the van came to rest. Photos from the scene show Loomis employees shoveling up the money from the roadway.

The newspaper reported that a company employee in the back of the van and the other vehicle's driver were taken to a hospital, where they were listed in stable condition.

Genesee County Sheriff Sgt. Pete Stocchi said a Loomis transport van was headed northbound on Saginaw Road just north of Dort Highway around 7 a.m. when it lost control on the icy road and swerved into into southbound traffic.

The van did a 180-degree turn and came to rest in a nearby parking lot. Neither driver was cited for any traffic infractions.

An unknown amount of coins and bills spilled from the van onto the shoulder of the roadway and parking lot. Empty coin boxes were visible along the road where the van came to rest.
