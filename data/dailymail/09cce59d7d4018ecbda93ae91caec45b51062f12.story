Sacked Nottingham Forest boss Stuart Pearce turned down an offer from owner Fawaz Al Hasawi to stay at the club in an advisory role — on a day six more employees left the City Ground.

It is understood Pearce was offered a senior role, initially believed to resemble a director of football position.

In a significant development, chief executive Paul Faulkner quit in the light of Pearce’s dismissal and Al Hasawi’s failure to consult him over the appointment of new manager Dougie Freedman.

Assistant manager Steve Wigley, first-team coach Brian Eastick, goalkeeping coach Tim Flowers, physio Dave Galley and head of recruitment John Marshall were all shown the door as Freedman began to shape his staff.

Al Hasawi, who flew to Kuwait on business yesterday, tweeted: ‘We will not be selling anyone. The season is still alive and we must hold on to our key players.’

Peterborough chairman Darragh MacAnthony has launched a scathing Twitter attack on a Championship club — believed to be Forest — for failing to make payments on a player whom they signed from the London Road club.

MacAnthony wrote: ‘OK Posh fans, there won’t be any incoming signings today but that has nothing to do with players having to leave, etc, the real reason is due to a certain championship club failing to make an agreed large payment (not thousands btw) last week on player they bought from us.’
