A heartbroken husband queued for 44 hours to buy the new iPhone 6 in a bid to win back his wife after she kicked him out - because of his obsession with gadgets.

Darius Wlodarski, 41, started queuing outside the Apple store in Cabot Circus, Bristol at midday on Wednesday to make sure he would definitely be able to get one of the handsets.

His wife Joanna called an end to the 20 year marriage after she accused him of valuing material possessions over his family.

Darius Wlodarski queued for 44 hours outside the Apple store in Bristol to buy the new iPhone 6 for his wife 

But Mr Wlodarski, who was born in Poland but now lives in Swindon, Wiltshire, decided to make the peace and spend £800 on a new iPhone for her – despite being out of work.

He was determined to keep a promise he made to her before their marriage hit the rocks and paid for the device on a credit card.

Mr Wlodarski has admitted the break-up was his fault: ‘I wasn’t the best husband and father unfortunately. I didn’t know how important family was to me.

‘I did so many things wrong and I want to say sorry to my wife and daughter that I wasn’t as good as I could.’

He split from his wife of 20 years Joanna last month and admitted he 'wasn't the best husband and father'

To make up for his mistakes Mr Wlodarski made sure he was the first person in the queue, arriving a whole day before anyone else.

‘Lots of people in the queue were very happy but it was different for me because of the circumstances.

‘It took me a while to realise what really mattered - and that is my family.

‘My wife said to me I should remember that it is now “things” that matter, that I was worrying too much about saving for things, and she was right.

‘I know an iPhone is another "thing", but I told her I would get her one and I wanted to keep my promise.’

She wanted new iPhone and he was determined to get her one as a gift and was the first person to join the queue outside the Bristol store, where he was welcomed by staff yesterday (pictured)

Mr Wlodarski met his 41-year-old wife on the doorstep of a house party in their native Poland more than 20 years ago and he said it was ‘love at first sight’.

It took him three years to convince her to go on a date with him, but after a year together they got married in February 1995.

They moved to England ten years ago with their daughter Daria, 14, but they split up a month ago.

‘I got the new iPhone for her because she wanted it. The first iPhone I bought for her, she was so happy, I was telling her for a year that she would be happy but she didn’t believe me and eventually when she got it she was happy,’ he said.

‘Now she wants the bigger screen so I got her the bigger one.’

He added: ‘I want to say that “maybe one day you will realise that I could be…good again and maybe you’ll trust me again”, I don’t know. Sorry.

‘I just wanted to make sure that I get what she wanted. 44 hours in total – I was the first, nobody was here for another day but I did it to make sure that I got what she wanted.’

Mr Wlodarski does not expect that the gift will win her back but hopes it will bring her happiness.

The iPhone 6 went on sale across the world yesterday and thousands of eager Apple fans who camped out overnight finally got their hands on the new handsets.
