An ambitious Russian plan has been launched to raise the wreck of an historic vessel that sank during an American hero's 19th century attempt to be the first to reach the North Pole.

USS Jeannette floundered in Arctic waters off Siberia after becoming stuck in ice during the daring voyage to the top of the world in 1881, and has remained there ever since.

Under the command of naval officer George Washington De Long, the elegant three-master, a former British gunboat, was 141ft long and kitted out in gold and bronze with its own on-board fireplaces.

After it sank off the Russian coast, the story of how 13 men survived following an epic escape on foot across frozen Siberia became a legendary tale of courage.

Now  the vessel could once more rise from its watery grave.

Equipped: The USS Jeannette before it set sail for the Arctic. It was designed to keep its crew of 33 alive in the frozen wastes, with fireplaces on board and fittings in gold and bronze

Survival: Some of those who finally made it back to safety pictured after surviving their ordeal. In all 23 of the crew lost their lives

Remembered: There are two memorials to the USS Jeanette. This one is at the mouth of the Lena River, where the survivors finally came ashore. The Lena is the largest of Siberia's rivers

American author Hampton Sides, who wrote an acclaimed book about the ship's dramatic final voyage last year, said he has already approached the US Navy for assistance but feared the current icy political climate would prevent a salvage operation.

On the other side of the Bering Strait, Siberian adventurer Andrey Y -- well-known in Russia as a director, screenwriter, TV personality and traveler whose real name is Andrey Khoroshev -- has begun his own initiative to raise the wreck in consultation with the Geographic Society, whose board of trustees is headed by Vladimir Putin.

'This vessel lies at a depth of only 18 meters [54 feet], with the known location down to one kilometer [two-thirds of a mile]. So in modern day conditions, to find and raise it is not such a hard task,' he told The Siberian Times.

'Imagine what kind of event it would be, and what it would do for our relations with America which are not very good right now.

'So perhaps we should give them a generous present by raising it.'

Whether such a salvage operation would be seen as a 'generous present' or a grab at American property in the context of increasingly tense relations between Moscow and Washington remains to be seen.

Epic: The map shows Henrietta Island, the freshly-discovered land which the USS Jeanette was stranded beside - and gives some idea of the sheer remoteness of the sea where the crew found themselves

Sinking: Contemporary illustrations told the story of the USS Jeanette, claimed by the might of the ice

Hell: The first stage of their trek saw the crew drag their boats across pack ice which persisted even in the Arctic's summertime

Dismal: After their trek across the ice the crew took to their three boats but one capsized with the loss of seven men. The two remaining boats separated and took different routes to land

Safety: The woodcut shows how so few survived when they eventually gathered at Yakutsk, capital of the Siberian territory now known as Sakha

The vessel is a memory of America's bid to reach the North Pole and the effort comes amid an increasingly aggressive grab by Putin's Russia over Arctic territories. 

Moscow - along with the US, Canada and other countries bordering the Arctic - are staking conflicting territorial claims to the potential oil and gas bonanza.

In recent months, Putin has ordered Russia to re-establish military bases in the region, and despite economic problems caused by Western sanctions over Ukraine plus low oil prices, he is pouring investment into his vast northern coastline.

This month has seen a major army drill in the Russian Arctic region.

Ground Forces Commander Col. Gen. Oleg Salyukov said this week: 'The Arctic brigades' role is to defend the Russian national interests.'

He vowed that 'specialized equipment and weaponry will guarantee their effective operation in the northern latitudes'.

Russia is currently making a claim to the United Nations that major undersea ridges are an extension of the Siberian land mass. If approved, Moscow will get the right to exploit the energy riches.

Eight years ago, a submarine planted a titanium Russian flag on the seabed under the North Pole, signaling Putin's intentions.

Last summer, the Kremlin strongman broke off from speaking about strife-torn Ukraine to tell a youth camp audience: 'We should pay more attention to issues of development of the Arctic and the strengthening of our position here.'

The US Geological Survey estimates that the Arctic Circle includes 22 per cent of global recoverable energy resources, and Putin is determined to get his hands on the lion's share.

The USS Jeanette harks back to America's attempts to claim the same territory.

And the vessel herself represents a tale of adventure in the most difficult circumstances - and a dramatic battle for survival.

Built in 1861, as the Royal Navy Philomel-class gunboat HMS Pandora, she lies off the most northerly island of Russia's diamond-rich Sakha Republic, also known as Yakutia.

Mapped: The thin black line shows the progress of the different boats towards land. Just 10 men survived

Captain: George Washington De Long was captain of the USS Jeanette but was one of those to lose his life

Mission: Kremlin-backed adventurer Andrey Khoroshev wants to lead the Russian expedition to raise the USS Jeanette 

Large crowds watched her set sail from San Francisco on her fateful voyage on 7 July 1879, to begin a daring bid backed by the US government to reach the North Pole.

She progressed well through the Chukchi Sea but, just two months after leaving port, she caught fast in ice near Wrangel Island and drifted northwards for almost two years.

During their ice-bound odyssey floating through the Arctic waters, De Long and his crew maintained unique scientific records of their journey.

'A full meteorological record is kept, soundings are taken, astronomical observations made and positions computed, dip and declination of the needle observed and recorded - everything we can do is done as faithfully, as strictly, as mathematically as if we were at the Pole itself, or the lives of millions depended on our adherence to routine,' he wrote in his journal.

They even discovered two previously unknown islands and duly named them Jeannette and Henrietta. But their success was short-lived and on 12 June 1881, the pressure of the creaking ice crushed and sank their ship.

The men did have enough time to salvage food onto small boats but they were left marooned more than 500 miles north of the Siberian mainland.

Yet what happened next became legendary as the crew, dragging their provisions across the ice, somehow survived ~ and even discovered more land which they claimed for America, though it is now Russian.

Author: Hampton Sides approached the US Navy to discuss the possibility of them retrieving their own vessel but says the current political climate makes it unlikely. He is pictured with a mammoth tusk

Memorial: The USS Jeannette  Jeannette Monument in the United States Naval Academy Cemetery. Its design was based on the cairn raised in Siberia in the aftermath of the death of most of the crew

Remembered: Hampton Sides published his history of the epic struggle of the Jeannette last year

This uncharted outpost was named Bennett Island, after eccentric US newspaper tycoon Gordon Bennett Jnr who had funded the Arctic mission.

None of the 33 crew were lost in the sinking but 20 perished - including Captain De Long himself - during the grueling trek to reach the mainland.

Some wreckage from the Jeannette was found in June 1884 on an ice floe close to southern Greenland, allowing scientists to establish that Arctic ice was in constant motion.

Writer Hampton Sides - author of 'In the Kingdom of Ice: The Grand and Terrible Voyage of the USS Jeannette' - recently said he was keen on finding the ship to ensure a piece of US history is not lost forever.

'We know almost exactly where the Jeannette is because when it sank, De Long's men took very meticulous positional readings.

'The only problem is that it's in Russian waters, near some islands that are somewhat disputed - the De Long Islands (named after the captain).

'So the hurdles for finding the Jeannette are more geopolitical than archaeological.

'I'm hoping this book might create an environment that down the line, when our relationship improves with the Russians, we could send out an expedition to recover the ship.

'I've spoken with some folks in the Navy and at NOAA (National Oceanic and Atmospheric Administration) who are interested.

'It's certainly one of my passions. One of my secret wishes.'

The voyage was 'at the very end of the nautical age of polar exploration, when there were still people who thought you could somehow reach the North Pole by ship,' he said.

'The North Pole seemed as inaccessible as the moon. There was also a good bit of nationalism behind it. We wanted to beat the British and the Scandinavians and the other powers.'

It took until 1908 for the first men to eventually reach the North Pole on foot.
