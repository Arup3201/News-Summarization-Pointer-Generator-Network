An important announcement on the way cancer can be diagnosed is due today – that will hopefully pave the way for simple blood tests to replace painful biopsies.

Scientists at Stanford University in California have long been trying to develop a pill that makes cancer cells release certain proteins into the blood.

In theory, those proteins would then be detected using a quick and easy blood test. It is hoped the drug will be sensitive enough to work on even the earliest cancer cells.

Diagnostic breakthrough: Researchers at Stanford University are trying to develop a pill that will help detect cancer by releasing certain proteins into the bloodstream if tumours are present

The latest research by John Ronald and Sanjiv Gambhir is to be published today in the journal Proceedings of the National Academy of Sciences.

Two years ago, the scientists presented early results from their research at the World Molecular Imaging Congress.

They said at the time:‘We envision a powerful new cancer management paradigm that involves tumour detection via an initial blood-based assay, tumour localisation via molecular-genetic imaging and tumour treatment.’

Such a test would detect the cancer cells released by tumours into the blood.

Scientists know that these unique cells are there, but the volumes are so small that so far have found it difficult to detect them.

The Stanford team’s approach involves giving people a drug containing circular pieces of DNA which are to break into tumour cells.

The DNA - called minicircles - prompts the cancerous cells to secrete a specific protein into the bloodstream.

Their conference paper in 2013 said: ‘We have developed tumour-specific mini-circles [of DNA] that drive the expression of secretable alkaline phosphatase or firefly luciferase [proteins], and validated them for detecting tumours.

‘These can be assayed via serum and non-invasive imaging to differentially identify tumour-bearing from normal subjects.

‘Importantly, they should have broad applicability in many patient populations ... across many different tumour types.’

Such tests would most likely be initially targeted at people known to be at risk of cancer.
