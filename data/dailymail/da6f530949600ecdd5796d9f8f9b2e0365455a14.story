Villagers took part in a four-hour stand-off to successfully fend off travellers from their green - but not before police warned they could be charged with false imprisonment for confronting them.

About 11 caravans drove in to the village of Nepcote, near Findon, West Sussex, shortly after 2pm yesterday.

Fifty residents then surrounded the village green - blocking the only entrance to the space with their cars.

Although some vehicles got through the human blockade, the villagers managed to block a majority of the caravans.

About 50 residents (some pictured) blocked the only entrance to the green - meaning no others could enter the space. The travellers (in the background) were handed an eviction order by police and they moved on last night

After several hours, their campaign was finally victorious - with police serving an eviction notice forcing the group to move on.

However, during the tense stand-off some villagers were warned by officers they could be charged with false imprisonment for blocking the group in.

When asked whether West Sussex Police had warned residents they could be hit with false imprisonment charges, a spokeswoman said: 'Officers spent time in Findon on Tuesday engaging with the community and travellers who arrived during the morning.

'At some point there were vehicles blocking the access to Nepcote Green, preventing the travellers from leaving.

'Owners of those vehicles were given advice by officers as to their actions and the travellers were able to leave the area without incident. The shift response by officers has been praised by residents.'

The episode comes just two weeks after another group of travellers invaded a recreation ground near Horsdean, Brighton - just 23 miles away.

More than 30 locals took to the Horsdean Recreation Ground in Vale Avenue, Brighton, to block eight vans from entering the site.

The travellers, who had been evicted from Wild Park in Moulsecoomb earlier the same day, were moved on at around 10pm.

One eyewitness today described the scene in Nepcote - where last year a group of travellers moved in and caused £8,000-worth of damage - last night.

More of the group pictured on the village green. Peter Goldsworthy, chairman of Findon parish Council, said he was 'absolutely delighted' the group had been removed yesterday

He said: 'They [the drivers] turned up and drove on to the green right in the middle of the village.

'The villagers took it upon themselves to fight and not let anyone go on. They blocked the only entrance - which had been locked - and wouldn't let anyone else on.

'They would let them get through.

'Police eventually managed to get rid of them. It was a great result.

'Apparently the police told the locals they were going to have to move as it is false imprisonment on the behalf of the travellers.'

Peter Goldsworthy, chairman of Findon parish Council, said he was ‘absolutely delighted’ the group had been removed.

He told the Worthy Herald: 'The local police persuaded the assistant chief constable to grant an eviction order at around 8pm.The travellers insisted on seeing the eviction order but were gone by 9pm.'

Resident David Gear told the paper: 'It was absolutely brilliant. Around 50 villagers were present to make sure that the travellers left, along with the police. They used all sorts of delaying tactics.

Another group moved in to the Horsdean Recreation Ground, pictured, near Brighton just two weeks ago. They were met by scores of locals - who blocked some of them out of the area

The group were moved on by police just hours after they arrived following the stand-off (pictured)

'We celebrated afterwards with burgers and tea and coffee. It was like the old war-time spirit.'

Judith Davies, chairman of Findon Village Hall said: 'They have blocked the road and the police are there in force. It’s so disappointing because of the money that’s been spent and the efforts of all the villagers to prevent this from happening.'

Of the incident yesterday, Sussex Police said: 'At 2.45pm on Tuesday police were informed that a group of travellers in about 11 vehicles had entered Nepcote Green at Findon Village.

'Officers attended and are remaining at the site, liaising with the parish council, and assessing the situation.

'Early on Tuesday evening, police served a Notice under Section 61 of the Criminal Justice & Public Order Act 1994 on the travellers at Nepcote Green and they all left shortly after 8pm. There was no disorder and there were no arrests.'

Police confirmed today the travellers moved on after they were handed a section 61 order asking for them to move. The group had been evicted from Wild Park in Moulsecoomb earlier the same day

Of the Horsdean incident, a police spokesperson said: 'Police were called to a report of a group of travellers arriving in Horsdean Park Recreation Ground.

'Some of them had been part of a large group moved on from Wild Park on Wednesday afternoon after a section 61 order was served on them requiring them to leave.

'About 12 vehicles and eight caravans got on to the ground, upsetting residents. Police attended the site immediately and early consideration for a further direction under a section 61 order was undertaken.

'Officers remained at the site to prevent a breach of the peace.'
