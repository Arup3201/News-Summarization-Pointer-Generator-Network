A Spanish school has come under criticism after a teacher posted a video online of students apparently acting out an invasion of Gibraltar.

The footage of the play shows children wearing camouflage and carrying plastic guns shoot 'Britons' wearing Union Jacks.

The video has caused outrage among viewers after tensions in Spain and Britain over Gibraltar escalated this summer in a dispute over fishing rights and border controls.

A teacher at the Brianda de Luna school, in the small town of Alfajarin, near Zaragoza, appeared to have uploaded the footage online, according to The Telegraph.

The video features a group of 'Britons', wearing sandals and carrying Union Jacks, set up deckchairs in the auditorium, surrounded by what appears to be other students and parents, to a soundtrack of God Save The Queen.Â 

But as a tank arrives, along with students dressed as soldiers and carrying guns, the music changes to Spanish Bombs by The Clash.

The soldiers then begin to shoot the 'Britons'.

The school has come under criticism after viewers were left outraged by the video when it was posted online

The video has now been posted to Youtube and other sites by a number of users.

One viewer on YouTube wrote: 'Shameful and ignorant that the Spanish teachers from this school should encourage violence against another people because of their views.'

A Spanish viewer also wrote: 'What an embarrassment - if this is a college play look what culture they are teaching them.'

Tensions reached boiling point last month after Gibraltar dumped 70 concrete blocks into the sea off the airport to stop Spanish fishermen entering their waters

Tensions over Gibraltar have been rising since Spain's ruling Popular Party swept to power in elections nearly two years ago.

They reached boiling point last month after Gibraltar dumped 70 concrete blocks into the sea off the airport to stop Spanish fishermen entering their waters.

Spain reacted by increasing checks on cars with the claim they were targeting cigarette smugglers and money launderers - forcing people to wait up to seven hours to cross the border from Gibraltar.

Meanwhile, it was reported yesterday that Argentina and Spain have agreed to gang up on Britain to pile pressure on the UK government to give up the Falkland Islands and Gibraltar.

Argentine Foreign Minister Hector Timerman and his Spanish counterpart, Jose Manuel Garcia-Margallo, reached the agreement in New York on the sidelines of the U.N. General Assembly, the Argentine Foreign Ministry said.
