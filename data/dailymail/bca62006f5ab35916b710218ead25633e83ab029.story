Mairead Philpott, pictured with husband Mick, today lost her second appeal to have the length of her sentence changed

A mother jailed for 17 years for killing her six children in a house fire has today lost a second bid to challenge the length of her sentence.

Mairead Philpott, 32, was jailed alongside her husband Mick at Nottingham Crown Court in April after being found guilty of the manslaughter of Jade Philpott and her brothers John, Jack, Jesse, Jayden and Duwayne.

There was applause from the public gallery as Court of Appeal judges sitting at Nottingham Crown Court dismissed a renewed application by Mairead Philpott to challenge her jail term.

Mick Philpott was jailed for life with a minimum term of 15 years after being branded a 'disturbingly dangerous' man.

His wife, who is likely to be released after serving half of her 17-year term, took part in a plan to set fire to the couple's home in Victory Road in an effort to frame his former mistress.

The children were aged between five and 13.

Members of Mairead's family including her mother Vera, father Jimmy and sisters Bernadette and Jennifer, were in the public gallery for today's hearing.

Mairead Philpott was not in court.

Setting out Mairead's grounds of appeal, her barrister Shaun Smith QC said: 'The essence is the utter dependence of Mairead Philpott on Mick Philpott, whilst not excusing culpability, legally or morally, was not given sufficient weight in assessing the length of her sentence.'

He said Mairead was 'particularly vulnerable' to a man like Philpott who specialised in taking advantage of young girls with no family support or self esteem.

Mr Smith said Mairead, who had been a loving mother, would forever be known as a child killer and that her sentence would be 'a lifetime reminder of her inability to stand up to a disturbingly dangerous man'.

The Philpott's house was destroyed earlier this year following the fire that they started deliberately

The court heard co-accused Paul Mosley had abandoned an appeal of the length of his sentence.

Dismissing the appeal today, The Lord Chief Justice of England and Wales, sitting with His Justice Flaux and Justice MacDuff said there was 'no doubt' Mairead Philpott had loved her children but that as their mother she had a responsibility to them.

Lord Thomas dismissed Mr Smith's claims that she could not stand up for herself against her husband.

'This was not a spur of the moment plan. The risks of pouring petrol inside a building must have been obvious. She participated in the setting of the fire as petrol was found on her clothes.

'Her conduct after arrest was one 
where she continued to maintain the lie that others were responsible. It
may be that she was under the continuing domination of Michael 
Philpott.'

He continued: 'It
is extremely difficult to understand that during that custody time and 
the lengthy trial she did not admit the truth, expose the lie and own up
to abusing her responsibilities.

'She was capable of standing up. She could make a choice. She had a responsibility that was not overborne by the will of Michael Philpott.'

The decision comes after she lost the first round of a bid to challenge the length of her sentence in July.

The hearing was the first to be held outside London since legislation was passed to allow Court of Appeal hearings to be broadcast.

Philpott's father Jimmy Duffy said outside court that he believed his daughter should have been given a life sentence.

He also told reporters his daughter had ignored his last letter and 'has nothing to do with us'.

Mr Duffy said: 'There is love there because she is my flesh and blood, but I'll never forgive her for what she's done.'

He added: 'At the beginning I said that the whole trio should've got a life sentence.'

Duwayne Philpott's organs have been donated to help save the life of a 30-year-old man in hospital

The organs of one of the six Philpott children killed by their parents have been used to save the life of a dying man.

Duwayne Philpott's organs were donated to help save the life of a 30-year-old man in hospital.

His older siblings David, 27, Richard, 26, and his sister, 22-year-old Michaela, were invited along with other family members to a special ceremony at which he was posthumously honoured for his gift of life.

Self-employed bricklayer Richard said: 'All of us feel thankful that we had the kids in our lives.

'It was a very hard decision to make when we agreed to turn off his life support machine.

'It is something I will never forget. The pain was immense. David and Michaela were with me. There were eight of us in the room.

'We talked to the organ donation team and we agreed that something good should come out of something so tragic and sad.'

He added 'It's a nice feeling to think that part of Duwayne is still in this world. I just wish we could have donated organs from our other brothers and sister to help more people.

David said: 'Some things are still very vivid in my mind, like when we all sat in the hospital chapel and a doctor came to tell us that Duwayne wasn't going to make it.

'We were all hoping that he would survive. By then, we knew that all the other children had passed away.

'We told him stories that we had shared with him, like when Michaela was cutting his hair and forgot to attach the grader and he had to have all hair shaved off, although he was very forgiving and saw the funny side.

'Duwayne looked alive and the nurses encouraged us to talk to him in case he could hear us without being able to respond. He was attached to a machine and we prayed that he would make it.

'It felt like once Duwayne knew that his younger brothers and sister had gone he would then be able to join them.

'He was very close to the younger ones and would not want to be without them.

'We think he decided to go with them so they wouldn't be on their own.'
