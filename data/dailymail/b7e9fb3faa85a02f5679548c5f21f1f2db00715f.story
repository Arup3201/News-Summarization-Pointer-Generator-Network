He later Tweeted: I just met Prince Harry and asked him if he wanted to come to see @MrPeterAndre in concert with me.

He told Mail Online archly afterwards: 'Harry is a fan. Apparently.'

Both Harry and his brother, Prince William, took the banter in their stride, however, exchanging jokes with the star.

Walliams, who was co hosting the event with presenter Natalie Pinkham, a close friend of Harry, also had his audience in stitches before the royal party arrived with a serious of risqué jokes about celebrity arrests and getting 'pissed off your head'.

After the event three princes also posed with the Military Wives Choir and street lyricist George The Poet.

The three looked in good spirits as they took seats on the stage at tonight's event - a gala Responsible Business awards dinner organised by Prince Charles's Business In The Community

Tonight's event was a gala Responsible Business awards dinner organised by Prince Charles's Business In The Community  charity Founded by Charles 32 years ago it promotes the prince's belief that business should go far beyond the financial bottom line.

He seemed delighted that his sons had chosen to join him at the event, telling the audience that he was 'proud, delighted and amazed that my own next generation has decided to accompany me here tonight'.

'Perhaps curiosity has finally got the better of them? ' he joked.

But there was a far more serious message the prince wanted to get across as He urged business leaders to employ more former servicemen and women, warning: ‘Fortune very often does not favour the brave.’

The heir to the throne highlighted the ‘loyalty and integrity’ of ex-military personnel as qualities that should be valued more by British firms.

William and his father also wore the same shade of blue - with the eldest son matching his suit with a tie very similar to that worn by his father

In a keynote speech, Charles, who is president of the Business in the Community (BITC) charity, stressed the importance of creating training and job opportunities for former service personnel as well as for young, disabled and unemployed people.

He said: ‘I want to look at a situation, which is just as big a concern to my sons as it is to me, where fortune very often does not favour the brave.

‘And that is in the opportunities available to our troops when they return home and seek employment outside the armed forces. Loyalty, integrity, teamwork and the ability to work calmly and with discipline and good humour under intense pressure are qualities that any business must surely value highly.

‘However the transition is by no means easy, and we should not pretend it is, even for the able-bodied. For those who have been wounded, of course, the difficulties are greater still.’

Charles, who has served with the Royal Air Force and Royal Navy, added: ‘One of the biggest differences the corporate sector can make, is the development of the skills needed to fill the skills gaps and create the employment and economic independence that enable individuals to contribute fully to the community in which they live.’

The family appeared to share a joke as they walked in to the event. In a keynote speech inside, Charles stressed the importance of creating job opportunities for former service personnel as well as for young, disabled and unemployed people
