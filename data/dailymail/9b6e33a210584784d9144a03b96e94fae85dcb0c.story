Dutch daily newspaper De Telegraaf have thrown their support behind the national team in the most artistic of manners.

Their front page on the day of the World Cup semi-final depicts Holland manager Louis van Gaal leading Argentina captain Lionel Messi in a dance, with the Arena de Sao Paulo and World Cup trophy as a backdrop.

The image - which has Van Gaal wearing an orange suit - is accompanied by the headline: 'Last Tango for Messi.'

To further gee up the Dutch public, the sub-headline on the page reads: 'Revenge for 1978', in reference to the World Cup final defeat by Argentina in Buenos Aires 36 years ago.
