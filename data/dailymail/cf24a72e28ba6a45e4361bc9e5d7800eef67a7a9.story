An editor has apologised after her magazine mocked a cancer survivor for wearing a ‘lame’ tutu while running a marathon.

Lucy Danziger, the editor-in-chief of Self magazine, said she was ‘personally mortified’ after her magazine made fun of Monika Allen, a brain cancer survivor from San Diego.

A photograph of Ms Allen, dressed as Wonder Woman in a tutu, was in the magazine captioned: ‘A racing tutu epidemic has struck NYC’S Central Park, and it’s all because people think these froufrou skirts make you run faster. Now, if you told us they made people run away from you faster, maybe we would believe it.’

However, after Ms Danziger realised the mistake, she issued an apology on Twitter saying: ‘@glamrunner apologies from me and @selfmagazine. We applaud you for supporting girls & wish Monika speedy recovery’.

The editor wrote on the magazine's Facebook page yesterday: 'On behalf of SELF, we sincerely apologize for our inadvertent insensitivity.

'I
 have personally reached out to Monika and her supporters online to 
apologize for the misstep and tell them we are trying to remedy the 
situation.

'At SELF we support women such as Monika; she is an inspiration and embodies the qualities we admire. We
 have donated to her charity and have offered to cover her good work in a
 future issue. We wish her all the best on her road to good health.'

She also told NBC 7 that an apology had been issued both to Ms Allen, who she described as an ‘inspiration’, and her supporters.

Ms Danziger said: ‘In our attempt to be humorous, we were inadvertently insensitive and we deeply apologize.’

Ms Allen was recently contacted by the magazine asking for permission to use her photograph in the April edition.

But she was not told it would appear on the magazine’s ‘BS Meter’, a ‘guide to what’s legit and what’s lame this month’.

Ms Allen, who did the run in the middle of chemotherapy, said she was ‘stunned and offended’ by the appearance.

'The reason we were wearing those outfits is because this was my first marathon running with brain cancer,' she told NBC 7.

The
 tutu was one of 2,000 Ms Allen has made through her company, Glam 
Runner, over the last three years. Through the sales, she has donated 
$5,600 to the non-profit organisation, Girls On The Run.

The
 magazine was criticised by a number of readers on its Facebook page, 
with some saying they would be cancelling their subscriptions.

Although
 the attention has led to a lot of interest in Glam Runner's tutus, Ms 
Allen has not responded to the magazine's apology, saying that it had 
not addressed the most important issue for her - the fact she had been 
'misled' on how her photograph would be used.

Ms Danziger told USA Today she was 'personally mortified' by the mistake, adding: 'I had no idea that Monika had been through cancer.'
