Not all incidents in football are clear or black and white - often there are shades of grey. Bolton Wanderers' penalty is one if those.

Zach Clough jinked into the Liverpool penalty area and Liverpool's Martin Skrtel committed a rash challenge and certainly didn't play the ball.

There was probably a little, almost imperceptible amount of contact which technically makes the challenge a foul.

Clough didn't dive as there was contact; however he certainly exaggerated the affect that contact made.

So, depending on your viewpoint it was either a penalty, and a soft one, or an understandable error from referee Roger East.

In such cases I always back the referee and, as he gave a penalty, I'd say he was right.

In such cases the referee should be back, so his decision was correct
