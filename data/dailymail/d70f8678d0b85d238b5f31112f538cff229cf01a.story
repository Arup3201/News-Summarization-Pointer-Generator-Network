Everyone knows that stinging feeling when soap suds go in their eyes.

But spare a thought for Raymond Cuss who was left screaming in agony when the 99p shower gel he was using burned his penis and testicles.

The 42-year-old said a layer of skin was ripped off his privates while his manhood was left glowing bright red after using the Dettol-branded liquid soap.

He was in so much pain that even when his underwear brushed against the affected area he doubled over in pain.

Raymond Cuss was left with severe burns to his testicles after using Dettol-branded shower gel he bought from his local 99p Store

Mr Cuss feared being left scarred for life from the gel that he bought from a branch of 99p Stores in his home town Gosport, Hampshire.

He has now been given £1,000 as part of an out-of-court settlement.

He said: 'It was the first time I had bought this particular shower gel, and chose it because it had the Dettol brand on the front, which I trusted.

'I had a shower to freshen up when I got home from work and suffered an horrendous reaction. When I stepped out of the shower and looked down at my groin I could see I had been burned.

'At that point there was no pain but the area was inflamed, my penis was bright red, and I had lost a layer of skin. I was horrified and scared I may have suffered permanent damage.

'As the area dried, I was left in incredible pain, with a burning sensation. I had trouble sleeping, and could not lie on my front because it was far too painful.

'I had tears in my eyes when pulling on my boxer shorts, and if any material simply brushed the area I almost doubled over in pain. I grimaced with every move.'

He added: 'I went to my local hospital and they said I had suffered burns. I don't have sensitive skin and had never suffered a reaction like this before.

'Because I'm self employed I had to go to work and battle through the pain, which was a real struggle. The whole incident left me feeling depressed because I feared my ordeal would never end.

'After a month of applying moisturiser at the doctors suggestion it healed and, thankfully, I have not suffered any lasting damage.

'I don't know what I'll do with the £1,000 but I certainly wont be spending it on shower gel in 99p Stores.

'I now get an even cheaper brand from Lidl.'

99p Stores suggested Mr Cuss' may have suffered a reaction when chemicals used in his job reacted with the gel.

In a letter to Mr Cuss, his solicitor Ian Barnett said that the company said: '...the chemicals used during the course of your regular employment may have caused the reaction you suffered when they came into contact with the shower gel.

'By this they mean that ... (normally) the shower gel would not have affected you.'

Mr Barnett contacted the makers of Dettol, Reckitt Benckiser, which examined the bottle and directed them to the supplier.

A Reckitt Benckiser spokesman said: 'A review of the product packaging identified it as most likely a product originally made for the Korean market and imported as a grey market product.'

Mr Cuss said he is pleased that he has now received the cash but still wants an apology.

A spokesman said: '99p Stores can confirm a settlement was reached between the claimants and the supplier of this product. There's no question of the authenticity of this product.'
