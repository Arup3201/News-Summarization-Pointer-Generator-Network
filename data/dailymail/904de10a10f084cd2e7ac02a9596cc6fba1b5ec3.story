The most expensive item on the menu at most Waffle House restaurants is less then $20. So when a South Carolina man and his wife stopped by the popular chain restaurant for breakfast last week, he was absolutely floored when his bill for the couple was more than $1,600.

'I almost had a heart attack,' Jim Andrews told a local news station after he was charged $1,666.61 for two breakfast entrees at a Waffle House in Piedmont.

Obviously, Andrews and his wife didn't eat more than $1,600 worth of food between the two of them at a Waffle House, so there certainly had to be an explanation for the enormous bill.

Cheap: In most cases, the most expensive item on a Waffle House menu is less than $20

There was - but Andrews had to take his inflated tab all the way to the company's corporate office to sort it out after the manager at the restaurant refused to acknowledge that something was clearly amiss.

The actual bill for Andrew's breakfast was $16.51. When the cashier rang it up, he says, something went terribly wrong.

'I sign it, and I look at it again, and it says $1666.61,' he tells Fox Carolina.

Obviously a mistake had been made. But Andrews says that when he brought the error to the attention of the cashier, the cashier argued with him about the ludicrous charge.

Correction: After being forced to go to the restaurant's corporate office, the charges on Andrews' credit card were corrected

After emailing several people about the ridiculous charge, Andrews says he finally got through to the restaurant's corporate office, where he was finally able to have the pending charge reversed.

'Our accounting department spoke with Mr. Andrews this morning to 
apologize and correct the matter,' a spokesman for the restaurant chain says in a statement. 'During the conversation, Mr. Andrews 
confirmed that the money was in his account this morning. Both the store
 manager as well as the area manager have left voicemails for Mr. 
Andrews to offer their assistance in the matter. No other incidents of 
this nature have been brought to my attention.'

According to Andrews, he was told that the mishap occurred because a 6 on the credit card machine was sticking, which caused it add two extra digits to his bill. He says that if he knew that was the case, he would have happily just paid in cash.

Of the incident, Andrews says the most frustrating part was arguing with the cashier about what obviously was a mistake.

As for advice, Andrews says to 'make sure you look at these receipts carefully.
