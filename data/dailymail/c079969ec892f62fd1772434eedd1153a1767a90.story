The court was told how members of the gang entered the pub around 1pm and approached a group of Luton fans drinking at the corner of the bar.

A Luton fan was punched, sparking violence which ultimately saw bar stools and glasses launched across the busy dining area packed with shoppers and families. Customers were forced to flee from the area in terror and cower from missiles.

Twelve men from Lincoln admitted a charge of violent disorder before the Football Conference game between Lincoln City and Luton Town on October 6, 2012.

Passing sentence Judge Sean Morris told them: 'You were like a pack of hyenas. It was a miracle no one was seriously hurt.

'This
was an extremely violent episode of public disorder. In the five 
minutes it lasted members of the public were put on extreme danger.'

Nathan Ashmore,33, Lee Swain, 26, Phillip Adams,36, Ashley Evans,22, and Andrew Deans, 27, were all jailed for three years.

Joshua Atter,18, was sentenced to 18 months in a young offenders institution. Liam Wiggins, 18, received 25 months youth custody.

Daniel White, 20, and Thomas Samways, 20, were each sentenced to 28 months youth custody. Each was given a 10 year football banning order.

Lincolnshire Police football 
intelligence officer Andy Pearson said: 'There were people of all ages 
in there, retired people and people with young children having food in a
safe environment.

'The
fact stools have been used, chairs, glasses and crockery have been 
thrown in such a short space of time it is some of the worst violence we
have seen in a number of years.

'There
have been incidents of disorder in the past but this violence and the 
fact weapons were used made it terrifying for those in the pub.'

The incident began when a Luton Town fan was punched in a pub, sparking violence which ultimately saw bar stools and glasses launched across the busy dining area packed with shoppers and families

Passing sentence Judge Sean Morris told the gang: 'You were like a pack of hyenas. It was a miracle no one was seriously hurt'

PC Pearson said there were three groups of Lincoln hooligans, known as the 'Lincoln Transit Elite', which could number in excess of 200 people.

'Someone could have been far more seriously injured from a result of a discarded thrown item. We accept that football disorder domestically has not gone away.

'The sentences will serve as a deterrent to anyone thinking of getting involved in public disorder but Lincolnshire Policeâ€™s football intelligence unit will remain focussed.'

CCTV footage picked up some of the gang regrouping opposite the pub after the initial attack before launching another barrage of violence against another group of Luton supporters outside.

Punches were thrown and kicks aimed at the rival fans before a steel chair was thrown at them.
