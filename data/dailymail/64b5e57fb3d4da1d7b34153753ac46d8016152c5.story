An ailing man whose sister bled to death on the operating table while donating her kidney to him has spoken out about his overwhelming guilt at her death.

Mother-of-three Yolanda Medina, 41, died after her aorta was sliced at Montefiore Hospital in the Bronx. In the wake of the death, the hospital has now stopped transplanting organs from live patients.

Yolanda Medina was donating her organ to her younger brother, 39-year-old Roberto Medina, whose kidneys began failing two years ago.

'It’s just tough on me... because she lost her life trying to save mine,' Roberto told the New York Post. 'And that’s really what is killing me every day.'

Yolanda's death was the first at the hospital in more than 40 years and 3,500 kidney donation operations. The procedures have stopped until a full investigation is complete.

Her brother was placed on the donor waiting list two years ago, but she stepped forward to help after he suffered renal failure and started dialysis in February.

She said: 'That’s it,' and offered herself as a donor, Roberto said. He added: 'She wanted to do it. I didn’t ask her for it. Nobody from the family asked her to do it.'

The night before the operation - on 
May 23 - relatives asked Yolanda if she was sure about her decision. 
'She said: "Yes, I'm sure",' Roberto said. 'She said nobody could stop 
her.'

Roberto collected his
sister from her home in the Bronx where she sobbed as she left her 
children - aged two, seven and 11 - but promised them she would see them
later.

The pair were then prepped for surgery, with Yolanda's operation going first. Roberto identified her surgeon as  Dr. Javier Friedmann.

As she went, 'she turned and gave me a look, a deep look in my eyes' before winking, Roberto said.

But two hours later, Medina’s surgeon, Dr. Liise Kayler, told him the transplant was not going to go ahead as there had been complications and they needed to resuscitate her.

Soon afterwards, the family gathered to hear that Yolanda had died.

Losing his sister also came with the extra blow that there was no longer a kidney to save him.

But
he added to the Post that the hospital called him on Wednesday to say 
they had a kidney match. He was scheduled to go to the clinic for a 
check up of Thursday to see if he was ready.

'Amazing,' he said. 'Heaven sent. This is what Yolanda wanted for us.'

His
lawyer Ben Rubinowitz said: 'If he doesn’t get a kidney in a timely 
manner, he will remain on dialysis, and unfortunately, it might result 
in something far worse.'

Under investigation: The live-donor organ transplant program at Montefiore Hospital shut down in the wake of the tragedy. Yolanda's death was the first for the program in 40 years

A spokesperson for the hospital said: 'This is a heartbreaking situation in so many ways, and our hearts are with the patient’s family during this difficult time.

'Surgeons respect and honor the trust that is placed in them every day, but in rare situations like this, it is still readily apparent that medicine is far from perfect.

'Our transplantation department is among the very best in the country and in 40 years we have never experienced a loss such as this. We are focused now on caring for the patient as he awaits his transplant.'

Of the failed surgery, a spokesperson added: 'The patient experienced a rare 
complication of this surgery. The doctors 
recognised the problem and took extensive steps to save the patient's 
life.'

In the wake of the incident, Montefiore Hospital has stopped transplanting organs from live patients.

On its webpage, Montefiore had written: 'In 40 years of performing live donor transplant 
surgery, Montefiore has not experienced a single living donor death 
related to donation.'

The sentence has been taken down in recent weeks.

Shattered reputation: The hospital has carried out 3,500 kidney transplants over the past 40 years, with 1,000 from live donors

The state Health Department is 
investigating the death and the program will only start again when the 
investigation has concluded.

'We are working closely with the hospital to determine what occurred,' Health Department spokesman Bill Schwarz told the Post.

The hospital has conducted 3,500 kidneys transplants since 1967, with around 1,000 coming from live donors in that time.

Deaths while on the operating table for organ donation are rare; Montefiore estimates three people die out of every 10,000 surgeries.

In a recent high-profile case, Lorraine Hawks from Massachusetts launched a lawsuit against the clinic where her husband died in surgery.

Paul Hawks, 57, was donating part of his liver to his brother-in-law when he bled to death.

His wife claimed her husband's EKG before the operation was abnormal and staff had not used a high speed blood pump as he was bleeding to death.
