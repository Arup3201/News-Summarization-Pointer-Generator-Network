While some women can enjoy multiple orgasms a day, others can struggle to hit the spot.

Now a machine that claims to deliver an orgasm at the push of a button has been patented in the U.S., but in order to tap into such convenient pleasure, there is some pain.

The machine is designed to be a medical implant and includes an implant a little smaller than a packet of cigarettes, requiring an operation. It uses electrodes to trigger an orgasm.

A remote control could be used by an individual to send a signal to the implant.

It would stimulate nerves with electrical pulses to trigger an orgasm.

Contacts would have to be surgically inserted into certain nerves in the spinal cord.

A signal generator would also have to be fitted under a patient's skin - possibly in their buttocks.

Its creator hopes the box of tricks could be used to treat women with orgasmic dysfunction.

Jim Pfaus, who studies the neurobiology of sexual behaviour at Concordia University in Montreal told New Scientist: ‘Some women confuse what's called sympathetic arousal, like increased heart rate, clammy hands, nerves and so on, with fear. That makes them want to get out of the situation.’

While Psychotherapy is a common treatment, the implant could ‘solve’ the condition using a more manual approach.

A patient would remain conscious during an operation to fit the implant, where a surgeon will pinpoint the correct nerves to which to fit the electrodes in a patient's spinal cord.

They would connect to a signal generator - just smaller than a packet of cigarettes - that could be implanted under the skin of a patient’s buttocks.

The idea is that the implant could be triggered by a hand-held remote control, delivering orgasms at the push of a button – and it could even be programmed to deliver a number of orgasms per week or per day.

Orgasmic dysfunction is when a woman either can't reach orgasm, or has difficulty reaching orgasm when she is sexually excited.

Around 10 to 15 per cent of women have never had an orgasm.

Surveys suggest that between 33 per cent and 50 per cent of women are dissatisfied with how often the reach orgasm, according to Medline Plus.

Current treatments include: cognitive behavioural therapy and practical education.

But details have yet to be decided and clinical trials are set to begin later this year.

Stuart Meloy, a surgeon at Piedmont Anaesthesia and Pain Consultants in Winston-Salem, North Carolina is behind the technology and came up with the idea by accident.

‘I was placing the electrodes and suddenly the woman started exclaiming emphatically,’ he said.

‘I asked her what was up and she said, “You're going to have to teach my husband to do that.”’

Mr Meloy has not yet tested the device on men, but said there is no reason to think that it could not be used to achieve the same result.

A Minneapolis-based company called Medtronic is set to conduct the medical trials but Mr Meloy said that the treatment is intended to be used in the most serious cases of orgasmic dysfunction because it is as invasive as a pacemaker.

However, Dr Pfaus said that as teenagers currently endure painful operations to enlarge their breasts, they are likely to endure invasive surgery to reach orgasm more easily.
