Summer signing Lukas Jutkiewicz scored his second and third goals of pre season against Celta Vigo but it wasn't enough to give Burnley a win in the second-last game before their Premier League return.

Last season's Championship Player of the Year Danny Ings was absent from the Clarets squad but Jutkiewicz showed the Clarets' strikeforce could cope without him against quality opposition.

Os Celticos twice equalised through Alex Lopez and Nolito but the 4,550 fans at Turf Moor will have been impressed by the Championship winners' abilities against last season's mid-table La Liga finishers.

Jutkiewicz gave Sean Dyche's side the lead after just two minutes, smartly finishing off Ross Wallace's perfectly weighted through ball.

And Burnley had the better of the half with Jutkiewicz constantly a threat, hitting the post 13 minutes after his opener.

But in the second half, the Spanish visitors came back into it and equalised after 69 minutes - Fabian Orellana playing in Alex Lopes to net past Tom Heaton.

Jutkiewicz restored the lead straight from kick off, slotting home Ashley Barnes' drilled cross but even his celebrations were short-lived - Orellana again involved as he set up Nolito to curl into the bottom corner.
