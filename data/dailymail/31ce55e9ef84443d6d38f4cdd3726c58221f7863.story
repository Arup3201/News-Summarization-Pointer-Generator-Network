The printing press, the computer, sliced bread, the internet: Sometimes an invention comes along that changes the world as we know it.

Whether or not D Free will be seated among these revolutionary inventions is hard to say at this stage, but the company behind it certainly thinks so.

This small wearable device is worn on your belly and can tell you when it’s time to go the toilet, with an app on your phone sending you reminders.

A San Francisco-based company has created a toilet alert wearable. D Free attaches to your belly button and monitors your intestine activity. When it is almost time to go an app gives you a 10-minute warning. It also tracks daily stats and tells you how many times you have gone

The company behind it, Triple W in San Francisco, said in a video that D Free ‘helps you to take back control of your life.’

They continued: ‘You’ll no longer feel stressed about unpredictable bowel movements.’

While technical details on the device are not known at the moment, it appears to take readings from your belly, and feeds them to an app.

There are thousands of public toilets around the world, but finding one - especially when you’re desperate - can prove impossible.

Plus, it's increasingly difficult to find one that is in working order and free to use.

The Flush Toilet Finder app was created to solve this problem. It uses your phones GPS to find nearby public conveniences around the world that are free, and those that offer disabled access.

It was built by Jake Ruston, 21, from Rotherham, South Yorkshire, and is based on a global database of 100,000 public toilets. 

The app knows when you when you need to go to the toilet, and gives you a 10-minute reminder when it’s nearly time to go.

'We have detected activity in your intestines,' the app says when it, well, detects activity in your intestines. 

The release date for the product is estimated to be December, and according to RocketNews24 an Indiegogo campaign will be launched in May of this year.

The site also suggests that D Free will cost about £130 ($200) at first, but will eventually come down in price to about £35 ($50).

Apparently, over time the app will learn more about your bowel movements, improving the accuracy of its information.

From the video it also seems that the app will track the length of your bathroom breaks, and also shows you how often you are going each day. 

The developers say that it is especially useful for people who suffer from incontinence or those who have lost control of their bowel.

‘People with disabilities that need ample preparation time to go to the bathroom: the elderly, people with bowel dysfunctions, it can happen to anyone,’ the narrator in the video says.

‘When you go outside with D Free, D Free will notify you when it’s time for a bathroom break. You’ll have plenty of time to find a bathroom and accommodate your needs. No rushing required.’
