An angry Subway customer has been arrested in Alabama for allegedly holding up four the chain's stores because their 'Jared Diet' failed to yield him any results.

Zachary Rapheal Torrance, 18, was arrested Thursday in Hueytown on suspicion of armed robbery.

Police allege Torrance held up one shop on Wednesday and is suspected in three other recent robberies, all in the Birmingham area.

'He told the detective that he had been on the 'Subway Diet' and it had not worked for him and he felt like he wanted his money back,' Hueytown Police Chief Chuck Hagler said.

'The detective felt like he was being serious.'

The robbery happened about 8.45 pm at the Subway located at 810 Allison-Bonnett Memorial Highway.

Hagler said a man dressed in bright orange shoes walked into the store, produced a handgun and robbed the store of an undisclosed amount of money.

No one was injured in the robbery.

A second store, in nearby Midfield, was robbed on Monday at about 9.11pm.

The suspect used a gun in that hold-up as well.

Torrance was arrested in a Walmart store after after a patron there recognized him from surveillance footage that police had posted online.

Torrance told police he was at the Wal-Mart to get a holster for his handgun, which was recovered from his vehicle and appears to match the one used in the Hueytown robbery, Hagler said.

He has been charged with first-degree robbery and is being held in the Jefferson County Jail with a $250,000 bond, Hagler said, adding that he does not yet have an attorney.

Police declined to disclose how much money Torrance is suspected of stealing.
