British actress Talulah Riley is set to get $4.2 million (`23.27 crore) in her divorce from PayPal founder and Silicon Valley golden boy Elon Musk.

The sum's not bad for the 26-year-old actress, considering their marriage lasted just two years.

The divorce deal looks a little less generous in light of Musk's net worth though, which is an estimated $2 billion (Rs11,095 crore) - the result of a fantastically successful career in the tech industry.

Payoff: Talulah Riley, 26, was with billionaire playboy Elon Musk, 41, for four years. They were married for two years, but separated after just 10 months of marriage

Musk - whom the New York Times called
'Tony Stark without the Iron Man suit' - is paying off his second wife 
over the course of nine years, TMZ reported.

But, in the interim, Riley gets to 
keep her Cartier and Gucci watches, an assortment of diamond jewellery 
and her $110,000 Tesla Roadster. She received $1.4 million up front as 
an initial payoff, according to court documents.

Musk, a South African who attended 
the University of Pennsylvania, made his fortune by founding a series of
highly successful ventures - beginning with Zip2, which produced online
content publishing software that was purchased in 1999 for nearly $340 
million.

Later, for his next venture, Musk helped create PayPal, the online money transfer and payment service.

Ebay bought PayPal for $1.2 billion in 2002. Musk founded Space X later that year - an outer space exploration company.

In 2009, the company launched the first privately owned liquid-fuelled rocket ever to enter space.

Space X now has a contract to deliver cargo to the International Space Station that is worth between $1.6-$3.1 billion.

Musk also founded Tesla Motors, an 
electric car company that had a $226 million initial public offering in 
2010. For all his wealth, Riley seems content with the $4.2 million 
figure.

Her lawyers haven't contested the 
offer from Musk, age 41 - which amounts to a little more than pocket 
change for a man who spends a reported $200,000 a month on personal 
expenses.

In 2010, Musk finalised the divorce 
with his first wife, Canadian fantasy novelist Justine Musk, who is the 
mother of his two sons.

He had been with Riley for four years before they separated in July 2011.
