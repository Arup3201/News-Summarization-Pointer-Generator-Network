Three men have been arrested after up to 170 live birds were discovered by police as they uncovered alleged evidence of illegal cock-fighting and animal cruelty at a farm.

A number of dead cockerels with their combs removed were also discovered during the raid in Iwade, Kent, yesterday morning.

Kent Police said that removing the combs of birds is believed to be a common practice when breeding them for fighting.
