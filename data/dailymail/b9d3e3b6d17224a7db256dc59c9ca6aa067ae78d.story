Toilet humour usually always gets a few laughs - but the victim of this prank really didn't see the funny side. 

In an effort to win an ongoing prank war, a Czech woman sprayed her boyfriend Cenek's toilet roll with pepper spray in the hope of burning his backside.

Talking to the camera before the prank unfolded the woman explains that she is 'sick of pranks on me',  and that 'today it will be my revenge'.

A woman 'sick of being pranked' got her own back on her boyfriend by pepper spraying his toilet papper

In the video she gleefully shows herself spraying the toilet paper before putting it on the toilet roll holder

She then turns on a camera at the back of the lounge room and sets up another outside the toilet door, right

She then sets-up cameras and waits for Cenek to use the facilities. But the reaction she got once he had was far from amused.  

After emerging from the bathroom, holding his bum, Cenek keels over in pain, asking repeatedly, 'what is it?'. 

Eventually he simply lays on his side while clutching his bum and moaning, as his girlfriend chortles in the background. 

His girlfriend then explains that she pepper sprayed the toilet paper, to which he responds, 'what kind of prank is this?' 

As Cenek writhes in pain, his girlfriend continues to point the camera at him, to which he replies: 'Don't film me. Go away!' 

Her boyfriend, Cenek, hobbles out of the bathroom, clutching his bum with his hands while moaning in pain

Cenek pleads for his girlfriend to stop filming; when she doesn't he slides into the wardrobe to hide

His girlfriend then offers him ice to ease the burning, as he desperately asks her 'do you think it will help?'

The woman then gleefully reveals that she had earlier sprayed the ice with pepper spray as well

After telling Cenek not to 'overreact' his girlfriend follows him to the shower where she continues to film him as he uses a detachable shower head to spray water on his backside

He then slithers into a closet and pulls the door shut behind him.  

Viewers of the video might assume Cenek's girlfriend then experiences some pangs of guilt, as she's seen getting her beau some ice cubs from the fridge. 

But after he applies them to his burning backside, and the pain seemingly escalates, she reveals she has also sprayed them with pepper spray. To top it off, she then tells Cenek not to 'overreact'.

Cenek then escapes to the bathroom where he climbs into the shower fully clothed. While sitting on the floor he uses a detachable shower head to ease his suffering.

Despite his pleas for privacy, his girlfriend never stops filming.
