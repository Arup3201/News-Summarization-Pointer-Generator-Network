Up to 100,000 African elephants could be killed by illegal poachers in the next decade, it has been revealed. 

About 500,000 elephants currently reside in Africa after an estimated 22,000 were massacred across the continent last year.

But this figure could be slashed by 20 per cent if illegal hunting continues at its current rate, says a new report.

Alarmingly, this may result in the animals becoming extinct in some parts of Africa.

The report was released today at opening of the African Elephant Summit in Botswana's capital Gaborone, which was convened by the Botswana government and the International Union for Conservation of Nature (IUCN).

It shows a staggering 25,000 elephants were illegally poached across the continent in 2011.

Last year's killings - resulting in a slightly fewer 22,000 deaths - took place at 42 sites across 27 countries in Africa, says the report by the Convention on International Trade in Endangered Species (CITES).

'With an estimated 22,000 African elephants illegally killed in 2012, we continue to face a critical situation,' said John Scanlon, CITES's secretary general.

'Current elephant poaching in Africa remains far too high, and could soon lead to local extinctions if the present killing rates continue.'

Elephants in Central Africa are bearing the brunt of the poaching - with the estimated hunting rate twice the continental average.

However, high poaching levels in all sub-regions mean that even large elephant populations - as seen in southern and eastern Africa - are at risk unless the trend is reversed, said Mr Scanlon.

In danger: Rising demand for ivory is believed to have sparked an increase in illegal poaching in recent years

In September, more than 300 elephants were killed by cyanide in Zimbabwe's Hwange National Park - described by the IUCN as the 'worst single massacre in southern Africa for 25 years'.

The animals were struck down when 
‘salt licks’ next to pools where they drank and bathed were contaminated 
with the deadly chemical.

The rising demand for illegal ivory in developed nations - as well as poverty and weak governance - are believed to have sparked an increase in elephant poaching in recent years.

Today's summit was being convened to agree on policies to end the illegal ivory trade and secure viable elephant populations across Africa.

These include strengthening national laws to tackle wildlife crime and enhancing cooperation between countries.
