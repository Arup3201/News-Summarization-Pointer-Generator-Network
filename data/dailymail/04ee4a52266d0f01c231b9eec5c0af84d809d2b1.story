A 'fearless' lawyer has been murdered in Pakistan for daring to defend a man charged with insulting Islam.

Rashid Rehman took on the case of university lecturer Junaid Hafeez when no other lawyer in the city of Multan would because he believed in the universal human right to legal counsel, friends said.

Heroically, the married 53-year-old even continued defending Mr Hafeez, accused of defaming the prophet Mohammed on social media last year, despite receiving death threats from the prosecution itself.

'Fearless': Pakistani relatives carry the body of lawyer Rashid Rehman from a hospital following the attack by gunmen in Multan

Brave: Relatives of the murdered lawyer mourn his death at the hospital to which his body was taken. The married 53-year-old continued defending Junaid Hafeez, accused of defaming the prophet Mohammed on social media last year, despite receiving death threats from the prosecution itself

And on Wednesday evening two gunmen posing as prospective clients, burst into his office and opened fire.

'He was shot five times and succumbed to his injuries on the way to hospital,' a policeman told Reuters.

Hafeez had been in prison without being able to find a lawyer until Rehman agreed to represent him in February.

'Rightful end': An injured colleague of Mr Rehman arrives at hospital after the attack. A day after his death, an unsigned pamphlet was distributed in Multan saying Rehman met his 'rightful end' for trying to 'save someone who disrespected the Prophet Mohammed'

Saying goodbye: Rehman began receiving threats from other lawyers as soon as he took on the case, according to the commission

Grief: Mourners pay their respects at Mr Rehman's funeral yesterday. he was described as a 'fearless human rights lawyer' who dedicated his life to 'helping the downtrodden'

Blasphemy carries the death penalty in Pakistan but the accused are often lynched or languish for years in jail without trial because lawyers are too afraid to defend them. Rights groups say the laws are increasingly used to seize money or property.

Judges have previously been attacked in Pakistan for acquitting blasphemy defendants and two politicians who discussed reforming the law were shot dead.

The crime of blasphemy was sealed into Pakistani law under British rule but strengthened during the years of military dictator Muhammad Zia-ul-Haq (pictured), who died in a plane crash in 1988.

In recent years, however, the country - which is 96 per cent Muslim - has seen a surge in accusations of insulting Islam, says Islamabad-based think-tank, the Center for Research and Security Studies.

But many analysts see the claims as score-settling or a front for property grabs, and in fact have nothing to do with Islam.

If found guilty, defendants can expect the death penalty.

The charges are hard to fight because the law does not define blasphemy so presenting the evidence can sometimes itself be considered a fresh infringement.

It can also be very difficult to find a lawyer willing to defend those accused of the crime.

On Thursday morning, an unsigned pamphlet was distributed in Multan saying Rehman met his 'rightful end' for trying to 'save someone who disrespected the Prophet Mohammed'.

'We warn all lawyers to be afraid of god and think twice before engaging in such acts,' the pamphlet said.

Rehman worked for the independent Human Rights Commission of Pakistan (HRCP). He frequently denounced the repression of Pakistan's dwindling religious minorities.

'He was a dedicated activist from the very beginning,' senior HRCP official Zaman Khan told The independent. 'All his life he was helping the downtrodden. He was fearless and never gave any time to the threats. He said he would live for the struggle and die for the struggle.'

Rehman began receiving threats from other lawyers as soon as he took on the case, according to the commission.

'During arguments for acquittal of the accused, three persons addressed defense lawyer Rashid Rehman, in the judge's presence, and said: 'You will not come to court next time because you will not exist any more',' the commission said in April.

HRCP chairwoman Zohra Yusuf said she was devastated.'We have lost four human rights defenders in the last three years. Others are under constant threat.

The state does not even notice,' she said.

At least 16 people are on death row in Pakistan for blasphemy and at least 20 are serving life sentences. Many others are in prison despite not having been convicted.

At least 52 people accused of blasphemy have been lynched since 1990, according to a 2012 report from the Islamabad-based Center for Research and Security Studies think tank.

'Speak up, get shot': Activists of Human Rights Commission of Pakistan (HRCP) hold candles and placards during a protest against Mr Rehman's killing. Lawyers have gone on strike in the area

Pakistan has not yet executed anyone for blasphemy but members of religious minorities say they are often threatened with such accusations.

The law does not require evidence to be presented in court and there are no penalties for false allegations. Courts often hesitate to hear evidence, fearful that reproducing it will also be considered blasphemous.
