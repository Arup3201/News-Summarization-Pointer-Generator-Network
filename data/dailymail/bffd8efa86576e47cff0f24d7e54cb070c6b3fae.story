The greatest links golfer of all will get to walk over the Swilcan Bridge one last time. In an unprecedented move, the Royal and Ancient Golf Club have extended Tom Watson’s Open exemption for one more year to enable him to bow out at St Andrews in 2015.

Given this will also be the 40th anniversary of the first of his five victories, at Carnoustie in 1975, it’s hard to imagine anyone will think the R&A have called this one wrong.

‘If I have to crawl, I’ll be there,’ said the 64-year-old, who will make his 36th appearance at the Open at Royal Liverpool in a fortnight’s time. ‘I feel very proud and honoured to be given the opportunity to play at St Andrews once again.’

Watson will be wearing two hats, of course, when he turns up at Hoylake, given he is also America’s Ryder Cup captain. To that end, he could hardly keep the excitement out of his voice when asked about Tiger Woods’s imminent return to major championship action.

‘It is great to see him back and I just hope he is able to play free from pain,’ he said. But he did insert a caveat when it came to a possible appearance at Gleneagles in September. ‘I want him on the team if he is healthy and playing well,’ he added. 

The announcement of Watson’s invite came on the same day as almost 300 golfers competing at four great courses went after the 12 precious spots up for grabs for this year’s championship at final qualifying.

They included Matt Fitzpatrick, who gave up the spot he earned as US Amateur Champion when he turned professional a fortnight ago. The 19-year-old never really recovered from a poor finish to his first round and has one last chance to make it at the French Open this week, where three spots are available to the highest-placed finishers not already qualified.

Ireland’s promising amateur Paul Dunne, 21, posted an impressive 36-hole total of 10 under par to book his place.
