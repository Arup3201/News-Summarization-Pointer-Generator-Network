'No confidence': 13 of Boston's 14 deputy fire chiefs co-signed a letter blasting their boss Steve Abraira (pictured) saying that he showed no leadership at the Boston Marathon bombing

The embattled Boston Fire Chief Steve E. Abraira resigned on Monday after clashes with senior staff over his management style and his perceived weak handling of the Boston Marathon bombings.

Abraira was the first chief in Boston Fire Department's history hired from outside of its powerful union and since the April 15th terror attack he came under pressure from his 13 deputy chief, all who have risen up through the city ranks.

He will leave his post on June 7th and Deputy Chief John Hasson will step in to take temporary charge according to Stephen MacDonald, a spokesman for the Boston fire department.

In May, the Boston Globe obtained a leaked letter that 13 of the city's 14 deputy fire chiefs co-signed on April 26th signalling a vote of no-confidence in Chief Steve Abraira.

'His justification for failing to take action is indefensible,' they wrote.

That was just 11 days after the bombings at the finish line of the marathon killed three people and injured more than 250 others.

In his resignation letter, Abraira said that he was leaving his job because of the 'baseless attacks by the Deputy Chiefs, especially their actions of making this a matter of public debate by leaking their letter of April 26th to the press, has made it impossible for me to continue to do my job.'

Mr Abraira initially defended himself in May, saying that is a 'nationally accepted practice' for the top chief to continue to allow his deputies to handle the situation if everything seems to be working, rather than insert themselves into a situation that is already being controlled.

Swearing In: Steve E. Abraira is sworn in as the Boston Fire Department's Chief of the Department in November 2011

Chaos: Police and some fire officials were already at the bomb site when the two pressure cooker bombs went off but more were immediately dispatched

'When I got there I was comfortable with what was going on,' he told The Globe.

'You only take command (as chief) if there’s something going wrong or if you can strengthen the command position or if it’s overwhelming for the incident commander, and none of those things were in fact happening.'

However, in his resignation letter dated June 3rd, Abraira said that he never had the support of his deputies and was left with no choice but to resign.

'Your selection of me as Chief never had the support of a number of 
members of the Department who preferred that the Chief be selected from 
within the ranks of the Department itself,' Abraira said in the letter.

'I think it is also fair to say that unfortunately a vocal and 
aggressive minority of the members of the Department did not support our
efforts.'

Under control: Overall, the emergency response to the bombings has been widely praised as three people died on the scene but all of the more than 250 others who were able to get to a hospital were saved

The deputies- with the exception of one who did not sign the no-confidence letter- said in their April letter that this is not the first time they have been disappointed by Mr Abraira's actions.

They even mention an instance where there was a six-alarm fire in a Boston building and after he allegedly cleared the scene of being under control by the deputies, Mr Abraira went to the roof of the building next door to take a picture of himself with the flames in the background for his scrapbook.

Mr Abraira vehemently denied the story to The Globe, saying that it never happened.

One thing he doesn't deny is that he changed the department's protocol when he came into office in November 2011, making it so that he would not automatically become the so-called 'incident commander' at a fire as soon as he arrived.

He justified the move saying that before changing the operating procedure, he polled 29 other city fire departments around the country and the only one that still made the Fire Chief the incident commander was in New Haven, Connecticut.

His deputies don't see the move as one out of public safety but more out of self-preservation.

Protocols: Abraira changed the procedure for the department when he took office so that he is not automatically made the incident commander when he arrives at the scene of a fire

'(Mr Abraira) shields himself from immediate accountability while setting the stage for under­mining the confidence and authority of his command staff. While acknowledging his ultimate accountability for depart­ment operations, he avoids on-the-scene responsibility,' they wrote in the letter.

Boston Mayor Thomas Menino's office confirmed it had 
received the resignation letter but said it had no immediate comment.

Menino, who is in the final year of a two-decade run as mayor, had 
previously said he would stand by Abraira.

The
criticism of Abraira stands in contrast to praise offered to Boston 
Police Commissioner Ed Davis, who became one of the best-known faces of 
Boston's response.

The department’s current chief of operations, 
John Hasson, has been named acting chief, MacDonald said. Hasson was one
of the 13 deputy chiefs who signed the April letter.

A woman who answered the phone 
Monday at the Boston Firefighters Local 718 said union officials weren’t
commenting on Abraira’s resignation. Menino’s office referred comment 
to MacDonald.

Abraira, the city’s first Hispanic
chief, was also the first hired from outside the department’s own 
union. He led the Dallas department and was an assistant chief in Miami 
before coming to Boston in 2011.

In his resignation letter, Abraira
said his outsider status hindered his efforts to fulfill his mission to
modernize the department.

‘A number of members ... preferred that the Chief be selected from within the ranks of the Department itself,’ he wrote.

‘I think it is also fair to say 
that unfortunately a vocal and aggressive minority of the members of the
Department did not support our efforts,’ he said.
