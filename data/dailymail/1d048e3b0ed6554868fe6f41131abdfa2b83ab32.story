Lord Coe has attacked sports stars who use Twitter too much, saying it is linked to ‘underperformance’.

The Olympics organiser, who has been made a Companion of Honour in the New Year honours list, said he found it ‘bizarre’ that athletes spent their time writing banal comments online during competitions instead of concentrating on winning medals.

Speaking to BBC Radio 5 Live, the Olympic gold medallist said: ‘I’ve always found quite a high correlation between people who spend their time in competition texting and tweeting and underperformance.

‘I just can’t imagine why you would want to be doing that when at the most important moment in your career you’re thinking about telling the world you’ve just had a haircut or seen a movie.’

While he did not refer to anyone, his  comments may ring in the ears of British  stars whose promise did not quite live up to  the hype.

Diver Tom Daley was expected to reach the gold standard. But the 18-year-old, who has more than two million followers on Twitter, took home only a bronze medal.

At the height of the Games, Daley was tweeting up to nine times a day.

As well as posting pictures of the Olympic Village, he chatted to celebrities such as Cheryl Cole and Mollie King, of pop group The Saturdays, and even attempted to drum up a TV appearance on comedy quiz show Keith Lemon’s Celebrity Juice.

On his two competition days in the individual event, August 10 and 11, Daley posted on Twitter at  least 18 times.

One message read: ‘Competing in the individual prelims tonight at 7pm :) aaaaaaahhhh!!!!’

A
later one read: ‘Nap time before the finals! China seem unstoppable at 
the moment! But anything can happen! See you on the other side!’ His 
spokesman did not return calls last night.

Before
the Games, swimmer Rebecca Adlington, who won two gold medals at 
Beijing, swore off the internet after cruel taunts about her appearance.

But it didn’t last long and she tweeted several times during her swimming final on July 29.

Miss Adlington, who has more than 300,000 Twitter followers, posted: ‘Just sneaked into tonights final in 8th place!

‘Not expecting anything tonight, all I can do is my best :-) thank you for all the support x’

Later
she wrote: ‘Ahhhhhhhh bronze medal!!! Can’t believe it! SOOO happy it’s
unreal! The  crowd was incredible! THANK YOU to everyone, your support 
is amazing!’

Her spokesman declined to comment last night.

By comparison, Jessica Ennis, who stayed off Twitter during the  fortnight of the Games because she did not want the distraction, took home gold in the heptathlon.

Lord Coe, who received a life peerage in 2000 for his services to sport, said that during his career he was so focused he did not even notice the people around him.

He added: ‘I’ve walked past  my parents. I’ve walked past  close friends an hour before a  race and not even recognised them or registered.

‘So I just find it bizarre that people can be sitting there, figuring out in 140 characters what they would say to the world at that moment. Just go out and win the bloody race.’

During the Games, a number of athletes were criticised for using Twitter to promote their sponsors’ products. Diver Tonia Couch wrote about her new car, while synchronised swimmer Jenna Randall tweeted almost daily about her five main sponsors.
