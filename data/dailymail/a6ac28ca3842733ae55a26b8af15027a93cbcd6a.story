It's already been dubbed ‘space grave robbery’, but it’s not quite as sinister as the name suggests.

Defunct communication satellites are being scavenged for their valuable parts and recycled to reduce the cost of building new ones in the latest pet project from the Pentagon's research wing.

When satellites retire, certain parts such as antennas and solar panels often still work - but there is currently no routine effort to salvage and reuse satellite parts once they are launched into space.

The Defence Advanced Research Projects Agency is spending £114million ($180million) to test technologies that could make this possible and thinks it can save money by repurposing in orbit.

‘We're attempting to essentially increase the return on investment (and) try to find a way to really change the economics so that we can lower the cost’ of military space missions, a spokesman said.

Work on DARPA's Phoenix programme - named after the mythical bird that rose from its own ashes - has begun. The agency awarded contracts to several companies to develop new technologies.

Now it is seeking fresh proposals from interested parties next month. A key test will come in 2016 when it launches a demonstration mission that seeks to breathe new life to an antenna.

DARPA wants the antenna to come from a yet-to-be-determined decommissioned satellite and the agency has identified about 140 retired satellites that it can choose from for its first test.

The vision is to launch a robotic 
mechanic fitted out with a toolkit that can rendezvous with defunct 
satellites and mine them for parts. The plan also calls for the separate
launch of mini-satellites.

DARPA is used to funding blue-sky research and a few projects are slowly becoming reality.

In 2011, it dangled seed money to jump-start a way to rocket people to a star within a century in what's known as the 100-year Starship programme.

Long before Google tested self-driving cars, DARPA sponsored a robotic road race in which university-designed autonomous vehicles eyed for the finish line without human help.

The robotic mechanic would then string 
together the mini-satellites and old satellite parts to create a new 
communication system. The concept is essentially to perform robotic 
surgery in zero gravity.

DARPA said one way to keep costs down is for the mini-satellites to take a ride in available space on commercial rockets.

Harvard University astrophysicist Jonathan McDowell, who tracks the world's space launches and satellites, called it ‘an interesting idea’ that may reduce costs in the long-term.

‘The first few times you do this, it'll definitely be more expensive than just building the new antenna on your satellite from scratch,’ he said. ‘But in the long run, it might work out.’

Dr McDowell said the biggest challenge in the upcoming demo test is separating the antenna from the retired satellite without breaking it and then successfully integrating it with the mini-satellites.
