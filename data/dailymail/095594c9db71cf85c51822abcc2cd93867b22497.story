A former Library of Congress employee accused of using a work computer to post fake sex ads on Craigslist has pleaded guilty to stalking and identification fraud.

Kenneth Edward Kuban, 61, of Reva entered his plea Monday in U.S. District Court in Charlottesville. Kuban also pleaded guilty to violating a protective order.

Kuban admitted during the plea hearing that he posed online as his ex-girlfriend and posted more than 160 false ads on Craigslist directing men to her home with the promise of sex.

Stalker: Kenneth Kuban harassed and stalked a woman after she ended their six-month relationship

Kuban was arrested in March in connection with a protracted stalking campaign of a 64-year-old woman who had dated him for about six months before ending the relationship in February 2011.

According to the affidavit, after the break-up Kuban began stalking the woman. She took out an order against him which prohibited any further contact, but Kuban continued to harass the woman, calling her five or six times daily.

The woman changed to an unlisted number, after which Kuban called her service provider, Verizon, and told them she had died.

Her phone, internet and television services were cut off and it was a month before she could restore them.

Other pranks followed, including calling a meeting the woman was in to tell her that her property was on fire when it wasn't, before he began posting ads posing as the woman in the Casual Encounters section of Craigslist.

Classified: Using Craigslist, Kuban would pose as his ex-girlfriend to offer sex to men. He would disclose her home address and photographs of the woman

According to the affidavit acquired by The Smoking Gun, Kuban posed as 'a senior lady' who was looking for a 'hung' man who could 'give me some pleasuring.'

FBI agents responding to the ad were given the woman's personal home address and instructed to ignore the locked gate and come right to the front door.

Some of the ads posted included a photograph of the woman. 

Kuban's ads were so effective that men turned up at all hours of the day to the woman's house, some even flying in from out of state.

According to the Culpeper Times, the woman had to install a locked gate and security cameras. She put up signs telling potential suitors the ads were a hoax, but they were often ignored.

Local law enforcement was called to chase men seeking sex away, sometimes several times a day, according the the Times.

Jail time: Kuban worked as a preservationist at the Library of Congress facility in Culpeper, Virginia but now faces a lengthy prison sentence

Between January 1 and March 20 of this year, Fauquier sheriff's deputies had 46 calls at the woman's home, Lieutenant James Hartman, spokesman for the Fauquier County Sheriff's Office, told the Culpeper Times.

'They would pull up to the gate, find it was locked, climb over the gate and walk up the driveway,' Hartman said.

Three arrests were made on men trespassing on the woman's property, including of Gregory Lamont Washington of Boston, who allegedly climbed the woman's fence, walked up the driveway to her door before turning back. Washington is a registered sex offender who was convicted in 2008 of indecent liberties with children.

As soon as authorities or the woman contacted Craigslist to take down the fake ads, more would replace them. 

U.S. Attorney Timothy J. Heaphy says Kuban used a government computer at the Library of Congress 
to post 111  of the ads. Fifty-four ads were posted from his personal 
computer.

Kuban's sentencing is set for November 15. He faces up to 15 years in prison.
