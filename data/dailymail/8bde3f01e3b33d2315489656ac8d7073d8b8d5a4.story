An overjoyed mother who had given up after suffering multiple miscarriages in six years has finally given birth.

Stephanie Maundrell-Merritt had decided to stop trying to have more children after she tragically lost eight babies in pregnancy, all between the ages of six and 12 weeks.

The heartbroken 38-year-old and her husband Adam had decided to move on with their lives when Mrs Maundrell-Merritt fell pregnant unexpectedly.

Nine months later and, in the early hours on New Year's Eve, the long-awaited baby Ophelia Hope was born to the ecstatic couple.

'All we had was hope - that's why her middle name is Hope,' explained Mrs Maundrell-Merritt who said she spent her whole pregnancy in fear of losing her daughter.

'I look at her and see she's the reason the others didn't go right because without the miscarriages she wouldn't be here.

'It's been a real shock - I spent nine months in denial hoping against hope. It only dawned on me that I was having my baby when I was actually in labour.'

Stephanie, of Ipswich, Suffolk, had suffered her first miscarriage with her ex-husband, the father of her 18-year-old son Josh Caley.

But she went onto lose a staggering seven more babies after marrying Mr Merritt until the couple finally agreed to stop trying to start their own little family. 

'Because of the hormones I got to a point where I said 'I can't do this any more,' added Stephanie. 'We just said 'we have tried everything'.

'We were at peace. We weren't going to have our own child and you're trying to move on with your life.' 

The mother-of-two said medical experts could never exactly pinpoint why she was having so many miscarriages.

'That's what I found the hardest. It got to the point where we just stopped telling our families what was happening.'

'No one could get excited for us then as you can't get excited yourself because you are waiting for the inevitable. 'I spent the whole of my pregnancy in fear every time.'

'Falling pregnant with Ophelia Hope was a complete accident.'

Mr Merritt, 29, said: 'We had hard times, it's obviously not been plain sailing,' said Adam, a senior multinational caseholder at QBE Insurance.

'Physically it's not happening to you as a man so you don't have that connection. It was different for me as you're seeing your partner go through it.'

Mrs Maundrell-Merritt fell unexpectedly pregnant again last year and on December 31, at 5.16am, she gave birth to happy, healthy baby girl Orphelia Hope weighing 6lbs 5ozs

When Mrs Maundrell-Merritt fell pregnant last year, the couple knew something was different.

Once they were past the first trimester, the period of the pregnancy with the highest risk of miscarriages, they began to hope. 

'With Ophelia our normal milestones got smashed,' said Mr Merritt. 'We had never got to 12 weeks before. After that I started to think that this one could really work.' 

Mrs Maundrell-Merritt decided to have scans every two weeks for her peace of mind, and on December 31, at 5.16am, she gave birth to a happy, healthy baby girl weighing 6lbs 5ozs.

'It doesn't take away what we went through, but there's a reason why she's here and a reason why it all happened,' said Mrs Maundrell-Merritt, who works in sales and marketing at insurance giant Willis.

 'It's still hard to believe that I've become a mum again. 'You don't complain - you just have to get on with it. She keeps me up at night but I don't care at all. She could be sick on me, I don't care, because she's here.

'Even as dark as it can get there will always be hope and light and the end of the tunnel.

'Irrespective of where you are there are people who understand and can support you. It doesn't always end in giving up.'

There were an estimated 250,000 miscarriages in the UK in 2010 alone.

The Ipswich and Suffolk branch of the Miscarriage Association, which supports people affected by the loss of a baby, praised Stephanie for her perseverance.

Telephone counsellor Sarah Tomley said: 'Stephanie knows we are all extremely thrilled for her.

'It's amazing she has managed to go through this. It takes a great deal of bravery to do what she's done and she's an extraordinary woman.'
