A transgender army veteran made history as she became the first senior to have sex reassignment surgery under Medicare.

Denee Mallon, 75,  of Albuquerque, New Mexico waged a long and difficult battle against the government insurance program, and claimed victory when a U.S. health and human services board ruled back in May that Medicare could no longer deny the service, which they deemed medically necessary for transgender individuals.

And now, Mallon says she finally 'feels complete'  following the procedure.

History: Denee Mallon, a 75-year-old army veteran, became the first person to have sex reassignemnt surgery under Medicare

Long battle: Mallon has waited decades to undergo the surgery, living as a woman since the age of 40

'I feel congruent, like I'm finally one complete human being where my body matches my innermost feelings, my psyche,' Mallon told NBC News.

'It's taken me all these years and detours, potholes and whatnot to finally be where I am right now.' 

Medicare decided to ban the surgery in 1989, saying it was 'experimental,' and noting a 'lack of well controlled, long-term studies of the safety and effectiveness of the surgical procedures and attendant therapies.' 

Back then, Mallon was not yet eligible for the government program, but she faced her own problems when her doctors refused to approve the surgery, largely because Mallon was still having sex with women.

'I have a difficult time relating to somebody what it feels like to be me,' explained Mallon. 

'One of the obvious things people will say is, "It's a lifestyle choice. You've made this choice." Well, it's far deeper than that. It's so a part of my basic psyche, there's no escaping it.'

Mallon, who has been married three times and has five children, says she realized she was different when she just 5-years-old, and that all of her wives have been aware of her identity.

Those women tried to change her, but it never took says Mallon. 

Inspiring: 'I finally feel complete,' said Mallon after the operation

Steps forward: Some believe this may make it easier for other transgender persons to get the surgery approved by their insurance providers

As for her family, she says it was just her strict and very conservative father who accepted her gender identity, and that none of her siblings supported her, labeling her a 'weirdo.'

In fact, until 2012 Mallon, lived what is referred to in the community as the 'stealth life,' never revealing she was transgender.

That all changed in 2012 however, when she decided to become an activist and take on Medicare - after 30 years trying to get approval for her surgery.

It was a daunting task and one that had never been tried before, but in the end, Mallon was able to claim victory not just for herself, but for all transgender persons.

The HHS board said in their ruling; 'We have no difficulty concluding that the new evidence, which includes medical studies published in the more than 32 years since issuance of the 1981 report underlying the NCD, outweighs the NCD record and demonstrates that transsexual surgery is safe and effective and not experimental. Thus, as we discuss below, the grounds for the ...exclusion of coverage are not reasonable.' 

Now, it is expected that other private insurance companies, and possibly even Medicaid, will begin to approve this procedure for transgender individuals.

And while it is wonderful news for Mallon, some see it as a little bittersweet. 

'I'm so sad it took so long,' said Mallon's oldest daughter Kelly Mallon-Salter after the surgery.

'But I'm so happy that she's helping others to have it.'

Standing strong: Mallon live the 'stealth lifestyle' until 2012, saying she was a woman and never telling anyone she was transgender

Difficult time: This news comes just a week after the tragic suicide of transgender teen Leelah Alcorn (above), who said her life 'wasn't worth living' because she was transgender

This step forward is even more poignant following the heartbreaking death of transgender teenager Leelah Alcorn last week, who wrote in her suicide note that her life 'wasn't worth living' because she was transgender.

Alcorn's parents refused to accept their daughters identity, forcing her into therapy to try and change her, and the young girl cited their 'cruelty' in her note, which posted to Tumblr hours after her death.

In the wake of the tragedy, her parents gave an interview saying they still do not accept their daughter's identity, and then asked Tumblr to remove their daughters suicide note, in which she wrote; 'I will rest in peace is if one day transgender people aren't treated the way I was, they're treated like humans, with valid feelings and human rights.'

That dying wish is already being addressed by the Transgender Human Rights Institute, who have started a petition to 'call upon the President of the United State- Barack Obama, and the Leadership of the House and Senate to immediately seek a pathway for banning the practice known as 'transgender conversion therapy.'
