A former professional wrestler has been accused of stabbing his girlfriend to death after making a bloody snapshot his Facebook profile picture and leading police on a high-speed chase.

Brian McGhee, 29, allegedly stabbed his girlfriend to death in Tampa, FL., at about 8:30 Wednesday night and posted a picture of a bloody body part on Facebook before fleeing the scene and seriously injuring himself in a car accident while police pursued him, according to reports. Officials will charge him with first-degree murder.

The victim, Bianca McGaughey, 25, died at the scene from multiple stab wounds, reports said.

McGhee is said to have stabbed McGaughey at a Tampa apartment complex before his vehicle was seen by authorities, resulting in a three agency pursuit that ended in an accident in a neighboring county, according to the Tampa Tribune.

The Florida Highway Patrol, Hillsborough Sheriff’s deputies and the Tampa Police Department chased McGhee to just over the Pasco County border before he crashed and sustained injuries requiring an overnight stay in a local hospital, the paper reported.

McGhee has since been released and faces first-degree murder charges, a Hillsborough County Sheriff’s Office spokesperson told MailOnline. He is likely to be arraigned tomorrow, the spokesperson added.

The bloody snapshot was posted to McGhee’s Facebook page – and made his profile picture – one hour after he is alleged to have stabbed McGaughey to death. It is not clear which body part is in the picture, but multiple reports are saying it is an arm - it is also not clear if it is McGhee or McGaughey is shown in the picture.

The picture’s posting caused confusion and concern among those that know McGhee, with some people urging him to contact them and others wanting to know what was happening.

Both McGhee and McGaughey are originally from St. Louis, MO, based on their Facebook pages, it is unclear if the two knew met in Florida or knew each other from back home.

Starting in 2006, McGhee also wrestled under the names ‘The Future’ and 
Donovan Ruddick. The accused murderer also served in the U.S. Navy from 
2002 until 2004, according to his Facebook page.

Known in the ring as DT Porter, McGhee was a developmental wrestler with World Wrestling Entertainment from 2010 to 2012, and also managed a pawn shop and a clothing store, both in St. Louis, according to his Facebook page.

‘Once the oppressed, DT is the one now doing the enforcing. Determined to take out all of his childhood pain and torment out on the bodies of his opposition, DT lacks mercy, and will deliver great anger and furious vengeance on any who stand in his way,’ says his archived profile on a wrestling website.

This is not the first violent murder involving current or former professional wrestlers.
