Dr Geraint Hughes was found dead at his home in Feock, Cornwall. His wife Marion has been charged with his murder

The wife of a GP has been charged with murder after her doctor husband was found stabbed to death at their £700,000 home.

Marion Hughes, 58, who is accused of killing Dr Geraint Hughes, appeared before Truro magistrates this afternoon.

Dr Hughes, 60, was found dead in the coastal village of Feock, Cornwall, last Friday

Officers said they found the body of a man with stab wounds to the chest and he was pronounced dead shortly afterwards.

Mrs Hughes also suffered injuries and was taken to hospital but police said her wounds were not life-threatening.

A Devon and Cornwall Police spokesman said: 'Marion Hughes, aged 58 from Feock, near Truro has been charged with the murder of Dr Geraint Hughes.'

Mrs Hughes appeared at court for a preliminary hearing and was remanded in custody.

She will appear at Truro crown court on March 20 for a plea and case management hearing.

Mr Hughes, also known as Gary, was a GP in the Camborne and Redruth area of Cornwall.

Detective Inspector Ben Beckerleg of Devon and Cornwall Police said: 'An investigation has now begun to fully understand the circumstances and events leading up to this man's death.'

Villager Cynthia Vanstone said: 'He was a lovely doctor. He was willing to help anyone'.

Dr Hughes, who qualified in 1977, was a senior partner at the Clinton Road NHS surgery in Redruth, Cornwall.

The surgery's website lists his interests are obstetrics and family planning and said in his spare time he liked to go sailing.

In a tribute released by police, Dr Hughes’ family described him as a 'devoted father'.

'We are devastated by the tragic loss of our devoted and caring father,' the statement said.

'He was always there for us and we cannot believe he is gone.'

Dr Hughes, who had two sons, had continued a proud family tradition by following both his parents to become a GP.

His late mother treated the survivors of the infamous Belsen concentration camp at the end of World War II.

Dr June Hughes, who died in February last year at the age of 91, started her medical training in 1939 and was called up to serve as an Army doctor in 1944.

After the war she became one of the first female doctors in Cornwall and married fellow GP Edward Hughes.

They both worked as family doctors in picturesque villages around Truro from Chacewater to Feock.

The family home at Feock was used as a medical practice from 1962 and Dr Hughes and her husband carried out weekly surgeries in nearby St Day and Ponsanooth.
