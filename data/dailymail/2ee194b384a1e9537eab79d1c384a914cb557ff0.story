Have you ever dreamed of being wined and dined by Tom Cruise or want to turn heads as you walk into a cocktail bar on the arm of Angelina Jolie?

Well now you can, of sorts, thanks to a dating site brimming with celebrity lookalikes.

While many of us may secretly want to hang out with an A-lister, for many, Ryan Gosling and Megan Fox are just slightly out of our league.

Guess who? Olivia Peyech, a 24-year-old medical student, bares a striking resemblance to Rihanna, right, and is a member of BeautifulPeople.com, the dating site for the world's most beautiful singles

But BeautifulPeople.com, a dating site for 'beautiful people only', offers hope for mere mortals as it has hundreds of singles that bear a striking resemblance to a celebrity.

These include a Tom Cruise lookalike from London, a Megan Fox lookalike from Canada and a Brad Pitt lookalike from Denmark.

In fact, Tom Cruise is marketing officer Robert Kozak, 30, who said: 'I regularly get stopped in the street by people thinking I'm Tom Cruise.

'Most people say they didn't realise I was so tall! Since joining the site I've been inundated with messages.'

Hey girl, guess who? Jeffery Ayars, a 23-year-old artist, is a Ryan Gosling, right, lookalike who is a member of the site. Fancy joining and landing a date with him? Join the queue...

He was one of men and women picked from 2700 images submitted by 750,000 members for a lookalike contest run by the site.

And fans of Rihanna and Adam Levine won't be disappointed either.

According to the site there are 21 who look like Adam Levine, 19 like Rihanna, 17 Beyonce, 13 Halle Berry, 12 Angelina Jolie, nine Brad Pitt and Tom Cruise, six George Clooney, five Megan Fox and four Ryan Gosling.

Yet to become a member of the exclusive dating site, candidates have to endure a 48-hour voting period where members of the opposite sex decided whether they were attractive enough to join their gated community.

One in eight applications is successful yet it seems Britons in general are among the least successful, with less than a tenth gaining access to the exclusive community.

Americans are among the most successful applicants to the site, with a 30 per cent success rate.

The most beautiful country is Sweden with a 62 per cent success rate.

Is it the lips? Christina Chiebas, a 24-year-old artist, is an Angelina Jolie lookalike on the site

The sites managing director, Greg Hodge, said: 'Everyone wants to date a Hollywood star and we're the only site that can offer the next best thing: beautiful single people who look just like them.

'Even more excitingly, the site is not populated with one or two celebrity doppelgangers - for fans of Adam Levine, Rihanna and George Clooney, there is practically one lookalike from every continent.

'On beautifulpeople you are guaranteed to date someone gorgeous, there's also a chance you could date not one, but 21 guys who look like Adam Levine, or 19 women who look like Rihanna?

'If their fans are lucky enough to be accepted onto our site, they will find they're spoiled for choice.'
