The skydiver who fell to her death in Arizona as she tried to break a world record has been named as a 46-year-old German from Berlin.

Diana Paris was among 220 parachutists attempting to become the largest group to free-fall from an airplane in formation when her parachute malfunctioned, sending her plummeting to her death in Eloy at 7.30am yesterday.

Her husband told police the experienced skydiver had completed 1,500 jumps over her career.

Skydive Arizona blamed the accident on a malfunctioning parachute that 
was released too low to the ground to allow a reserve parachute to fully
 open. She was declared dead at the scene.

In a statement on its website, Skydive Arizona paid tribute to its 'dear friend' and vowed to continue its attempt to break the record in Mrs Paris' honour.

'The whole team met after this accident and amid the hugs and tears 
agreed to create a special jump, a missing man (sector) formation 
skydive, to honor their fallen friend,' it read. 'It is always a difficult decision for the organizers to make after a 
tragedy, but the team as a whole has decided to keep moving towards the 
record.'

It continued: 'However it will no longer be a two point 222-way.  It will be a
 2 point 221-way.  Our dear friend can not and will not be replaced.  
The group will continue to hold the slot open in the skydiverâ€™s honor.'

'It had nothing to do with the size of the group or the aircraft,' World Team spokeswoman Gulcin Gilbert said. 'It was a malfunction of the parachute.'

The accident occurred on Thursday during an attempt to break a world record for what is called a 'formation jump'.

A group of 220 people from 28 countries free-fall from about 18,000 feet, then come together in a formation before separating and doing another formation before pulling their parachutes.

The skydivers jumped at such a high 
elevation that they needed oxygen masks in the airplane, and they 
hurtled through the air at speeds of more than 100 mph.

The group did not complete the formation and therefore did not set the record on Thursday. World Team organized the event at Skydive Arizona, one of the nation's top skydiving locations.

Skydivers cried and hugged each other and prayed after they learned of the death.

Skydive Arizona in Eloy has been the site of other skydiving deaths in recent months.

Two skydivers - from Germany and the United Kingdom - died in November as their parachutes collapsed and they fell to their deaths during an attempt to set a jump record.

The previous record was carried out in Florida with 110 people in November 2013, according to Skydive Mag.
