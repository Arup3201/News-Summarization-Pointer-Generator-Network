Frank Lampard has revealed he could line up against his former Chelsea team-mates when Manchester City host the Blues later this month.

Lampard was released by Chelsea after 13 trophy-laden years at Stamford Bridge last summer.

He joined Major League Soccer’s latest team New York City only to seal a short-term deal with Premier League champions Man City.

There had been some suggestion Lampard, who played 648 times for Chelsea, would dodge facing his former colleagues when they travel to Manchester on September 21. 

But the 36-year-old, who announced his retirement from international football last month, insists he will make himself available for selection for Manuel Pellegrini.

‘The way I feel about Chelsea fans, it wouldn’t be a problem to play in front of them again,’ said Lampard.

‘I haven’t broached it with the manager yet but I am sure we will speak about it. I don’t think it would be right for me to declare now that I didn’t want to play because what happens if City get two or three injuries in midfield?’

Speaking to The Sun, Lampard added: ‘Am I going to allow them to play a kid there when they are paying my wages? On a professional note, I have to get my head round that one.

‘As a Chelsea player I would never have acted like that and I don’t want to start now. Whatever I do, it will be with completely the right intentions on all fronts.’
