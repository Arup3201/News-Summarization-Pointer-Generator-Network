Germany would rather see Britain leave the EU than allow David Cameron to tear up its rules on free movement of labour, Angela Merkel has said.

The Chancellor warned the Prime Minister that he is reaching a ‘point of no return’ by pushing for reform of the bloc’s sacred free movement system.

The threat has forced Mr Cameron to tone down his ambitions for any deal to curb EU immigration.

Germany would rather see Britain leave the EU than change rules on free movement of labour, German Chancellor Angela Merkel has said

The pair clashed at a summit in Brussels last month, German magazine Der Spiegel said. Citing senior officials, it said Mrs Merkel told Mr Cameron he was nearing a ‘point of no return’ with plans to introduce quotas for the number of EU workers who can come to Britain. She threatened to abandon her efforts to keep Britain in the EU unless he backed down.

One government insider was quoted on Radio Bavaria saying: ‘The time for talking is close to over.

‘Mrs Merkel feels she has done all she can to placate the UK, but will not accept immigration curbs from EU member states under any circumstances. It has come to a Mexican stand-off and it is now a question of who blinks first.’

Mrs Merkel was confident of winning the battle of wills, the insider added.

It came amid reports that Mr Cameron is ditching his quota plan to appease Berlin. Ministers will focus on making the existing rules work better for Britain.

A source said Mr Cameron’s plans – to be outlined before Christmas – would stretch EU rules ‘to their limits’. 

Nigel Farage said David Cameron could not win significant renegotiation from Brussels because the German Chancellor would block him

One proposal would ban EU migrants coming to Britain unless they had a job to go to. Anyone unable to support themselves would be deported after three months.

It is thought the Prime Minister will seek Mrs Merkel’s approval before announcing any changes.

Government sources did not dispute the Spiegel reports last night. They stressed that Mrs Merkel is still publicly voicing support for both the EU’s free movement rules and Britain’s membership of the EU.

A Downing Street spokesman said: ‘The Prime Minister will do what is right for Britain, as he has repeatedly made clear.’

But critics said Mrs Merkel’s warning demonstrated the weakness of Mr Cameron’s position.

Eurosceptic Tory MP Jacob Rees-Mogg said: ‘It is looking increasingly unlikely that it will be possible to get a successful renegotiation.

'I’m afraid it leaves me very suspicious about what the Prime Minister is trying to do. Signing up to the European Arrest Warrant raises questions about whether he even wants a successful renegotiation.

‘On immigration I think there is a question about whether he is making statements he can actually deliver.’

Ukip leader Nigel Farage said: ‘The only logical next step is to abandon the renegotiation and announce an immediate referendum.’

Former Tory minister Kenneth Clarke said Mr Cameron ‘knows perfectly well’ that free movement is essential to the EU. He told the BBC’s Sunday Politics: ‘All our companies, multinational companies, will go spare if you start interfering with that.’

Meanwhile, a study found that the UK is the most ‘prosperous’ major EU country – but still less successful than Norway and Switzerland, outside the bloc.

The Prosperity Index by the Legatum Institute think-tank ranks 142 countries on economic and social factors. The UK came 13th, just ahead of Germany. Norway was top overall, beating Switzerland and New Zealand 

Labour should apologise for lifting border restrictions on eastern European immigrants, a former aide to Gordon Brown has said.

Ian Austin, a minister in Mr Brown’s government said Labour should ‘be honest’ and ‘say sorry’ for opening the borders to Eastern Europeans in 2004.

He said: ‘If you make a mistake, you should say sorry. Let’s be honest about it.

‘It was a mistake. I said so at the time. I did not think it was the right thing to do.

‘What we have to do now is understand people’s concerns and come up with ideas that will address that.’
