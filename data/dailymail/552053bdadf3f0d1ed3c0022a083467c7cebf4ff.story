She likes designer dresses and admits she always tries to look her best.

But Karren Brady has hit out at a female Apprentice candidate who said wearing heels and short skirts would improve her chances of success on the BBC 1 show.

Contestant Sarah Dales insisted women are better at selling because they are ‘more attractive’. But the ‘antiquated’ view left Alan Sugar’s sidekick horrified.

Miss Brady said she would have intervened had she heard the comments during filming because they set a bad example to young female viewers.

The 45-year-old businesswoman said: ‘I think Sarah is rather lucky that I wasn’t following her.

‘She may not have lasted very long. I think it’s a very old-fashioned attitude that you’ve got to wear short skirts and a lot of make-up to get on in life.’

Miss Brady’s enlightened approach to women’s dress is at odds with her long-time employers, David Sullivan and David Gold.

She first came to public prominence as the managing director of Birmingham City aged just 23

The pair – who made their fortune through pornography and the Ann Summers chain of adult stores – appointed her as managing director of Birmingham City football club when she was just 23.

Karen Brady was appointed managing director of Birmingham Football Club at the 23. 

During her 16 years in charge the club went from almost bankrupt to being worth £82 million. 

In August 2006 she joined the cast of BBC's The Apprentice as one of Lord Sugar's advisors.  

She is now vice-chairman and CEO of West Ham United and has secured a major stadium deal, moving the club to the Olympic Stadium from 2016. 

In addition, she has slashed the club's debt from £100million to £20million. 

She famously sold her husband Paul Peschisolido, who played for Birmingham City. 

The couple have one daughter and a son. They live near Birmingham but have a home in Knightsbridge, central London.

The tenth series of The Apprentice begins next Tuesday. During the first episode, Miss Dales, 32, a hypnotherapist who boasts she could ‘sell ice to Eskimos’, is selected as a project manager.

But she quickly antagonises her fellow female competitors by announcing: ‘I’ve got a good feeling we will sell. And I’ll tell you why.

‘Because we’re female, and most people will buy from females because females are more attractive to look at.

‘Tomorrow, what we need to do is wear loads of lipstick, make-up, heels, we’re going to wear short skirts.’

However, fellow contestant, Roisin Hogan, 32, challenged her, saying: ‘Whether we have shorts skirts or short dresses on, it’s not really going to matter. I think we really need to think about strategy.’

Miss Brady, the vice-chairman of West Ham United, is the Government’s Small Business Ambassador.

She is often seen wearing designs by Victoria Beckham, Christian Louboutin, Chanel, Dolce & Gabbana and Yves Saint Laurent but ‘used to love the thrill of buying something that showed my legs, arms and anything else I fancied’.
