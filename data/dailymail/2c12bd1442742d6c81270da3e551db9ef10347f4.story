A sinkhole partly swallowed a utility truck and forced the evacuation of 30 people after it struck, but did not break, a gas line in Pennsylvania's Lehigh Valley. 

Officials ordered the evacuation around 12:20 a.m. Friday. They say the sinkhole opened about 90 minutes earlier, as crews worked on a water main break in Bethlehem Township. 

The driver of the PPL truck escaped safely. The truck remained in the hole for several hours, resting against a 4-inch, high-pressure natural gas line.

Sinkhole: Work crews dig up the street to repair a water main after a driveway collapsed at a nearby home on Friday in Bethlehem Township, Pennsylvania 

Evacuated: A house is roped off  after a driveway collapsed on Friday, and forced the evacuation of 30 people after it struck,  but did not break a gas line 

Officials say the gas line remained intact and there was no leak. They say they ordered the evacuated of about 10 homes within a 300-foot radius as a precautionary measure.

The American Red Cross set up an evacuation center at Bethlehem Township's community center.

Lehigh Valley Live reports that no one was hurt during the incident and that the evacuation was precautionary.

 'I was just pulling out when it was pulled into the hole,' said the truck driver.

'One heck of a hole,' he quipped.

Toni Corgliano who lives in Hampton Road where the sinkhole developed said she heard a big crash and ran outside to see a truck stuck inside of the hole.

'I thought, "Oh, my God. This isn't good," ' Corigliano told Mcall.com.

'It is scary because no one seems to know how much damage is underneath,' she added.

Minutes after incident, cops knocked on her door and told her she had to evacuate so she spent the night in a hotel.

'I'm worried about my neighbors, ‘Corigliano said.

'I can't imagine what they are going through.'

Residents were allowed back into their homes by 8am on Friday but the breadth or cost of the damage is still unspecified.
