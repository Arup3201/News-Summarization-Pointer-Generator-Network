Three men have been charged with hate crime and assault after screaming profanities at a man dressed as a woman before chasing him down the street and shooting him in the bottom.

Cody Sigue, 22 Matthew Smith, 21, and Tavon Johnson, 17, began to harass the victim and a friend as they walked down Broadway, near Putnam Avenue, in Brooklyn at around 7am.

After hurling anti-gay abuse at the pair, they then chased the men as they ran away - before opening fire.

The man struck by the bullet was taken to Brookdale University Hospital, treated for his injuries and released. 

Police officers soon caught up with the homophobic gang of attackers, who are all from Brooklyn, and after a brief chase on foot, were able to arrest them all, New York Daily News reports.  

Johnson and Sigue were charged with menacing and third-degree hate crime, while Smith was charged with assault in the first-degree, cops said.

Police sources said Johnson has one prior arrest for marijuana, Sigue has one prior sealed arrest and Smith has 'an extensive arrest history', with 14 arrests including robbery.

One gay witness, Daquan Ruddock, 24, who lives in Bedford-Stuyvesant not far from the crime scene, described the shocking incident.

He said: 'It's messed up. That shows how gay people can't walk around in the street without someone saying something or doing something towards them. It's sad.'

Eric Dowling, 30, a barber at M.J. Beauty Salon, said the victim was a customer at the shop.

He added: 'It's a violent neighborhood - a lot of things happen. It's a sad thing it happened to him.'

Last August, a transgender woman was beaten to death in Harlem, New York, by a group of men who had been shouting anti-gay abuse at her.

The victim, 21-year-old Islan Nettles, died five days after the attack in a Harlem hospital when she was taken off a life support machine
