Accused: Along with 15 members of his Amish sect, Samuel Mullet, Sr. will stand trial Monday on charges that include federal hate crimes, conspiracy and obstruction of justice

Sixteen members of a breakaway Amish sect that federal prosecutors have labeled a 'cult' will stand trial Monday for a laundry list of misdeeds officials say were hate crimes against their brethren.

Samuel Mullet Sr. allegedly ordered beatings of wayward Amish, slept with married women to 'cleanse them,' and, last fall, instructed followers to shave off the beards and hair of his critics - a deeply offensive act within Amish culture.

The 'Amish 16' - including four of Mullet's 17 children, his son-in-law and three of his nephews - are to stand trial in Cleveland on federal charges of perpetrating hate crimes, conspiracy, evidence tampering and obstruction of justice.

The defendants maintain the government is on a witch-hunt - and shouldn't intrude on internal church disciplinary matters.

They've denied the charges and rejected plea deals that would carry sentences of two to three years in prison instead of what they now face - sentences of 20 years or more.

Mullet has said he didn't order the hair-cutting but also added he didn't stop anyone from carrying it out.

He also has defended what he thinks is his right to punish disobedient sect members.

'You have your laws on the road and the town - if somebody doesn't obey them, you punish them,' Mullet told the Associated Press last October.

'But I'm not allowed to punish the church people? I (should) just let them run over me? If every family would just do as they pleased, what kind of church would we have?'

At stake is prosecutor's ability to vividly portray how an Amish sect struggles with the encroaching modernity assaulting its insular community.

In the case of the Mullet sect, the alleged knee-jerk reaction, they claim, violently broke the law.

'When there are conflicts and you find yourself outside the accepted set, it's a very difficult place to be,' said Matthew Schrock, a one-time member of Holmes 
County's Amish community during the 1990s.

'When someone believes something slightly different, (people believe) that's a threat to my existence.'

Schrock added that religious disputes were commonplace in the often-time strictly-observant Amish culture - and often took an emotion toll on those not directly involved.

To wit, it was just such a religious dispute that lead to the creation of the Amish, as a whole.

Schisms: Deep differences within the Amish about how to cope with modernity have lead to dozens of splinter groups, one being the radical sect whose members (pictured) now stand trial

The group famously broke away from the Mennonites
in 1693 over the practice of shunning church members.

Another group 
known as the Beachy Amish formed in 1927 and soon began allowing the use
electricity and automobiles.

Since then, multiple schisms within the church, which has no central authority, have created a range of Amish churches with varying rules and beliefs.

David McConnell, a professor at Wooster College, said there are a dozen Amish groups living in Ohio's Holmes County, alone, home to one of the nation's largest Amish settlements.

Mullet, Sr. relocated the members of his group in 1995 to a hilly area near the West Virginia panhandle after a dispute with his former group

'It's a divorce within the 
congregation,' said Karen Johnson-Weiner, a professor at the State 
University of New York in Potsdam. 'It's very, very sad and heart-breaking.'

The usual expectation is that the breakup is the end of the dispute, she said.

'Each side says you go off and do your own thing and that's the end of it,' said Johnson-Weiner. 'There's an understanding that you can't judge them. It's up to God to judge the choices they make.'

In the case of a break-up, new bishops and ministers assume control. Sometimes the new group will move away but not usually. Those that are pulled apart can join together at weddings and funerals but not for worship services. Even families can be divided.

Mullet relocated the members of his group in 1995 to a hilly area near the West Virginia panhandle after a dispute with his former group. They nowÂ  live on farms along a gravel road.The 66-year-old, who has fathered at least 17 children, has denied characterizations from authorities that his group is a cult.

The hair-cuttings, he has said, were a response to continuous criticism he'd received from other Amish religious leaders about his being too strict, including excommunicating and shunning people within his own group.

The Amish believe the Bible instructs women to let their hair grow long and men to grow beards and stop shaving once they marry.

In one of the attacks, authorities say, one couple acknowledged that their two sons and another man came into their house, held them down, and cut the father's beard and the mother's hair. They refused to press charges.
