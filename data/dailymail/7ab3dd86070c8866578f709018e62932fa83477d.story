Stephen Lawrence, 18, was stabbed twice after he was attacked in Eltham, South London in 1993

A new review has been ordered into claims police corruption impeded the original Stephen Lawrence murder investigation.

Home Secretary Theresa May has appointed a leading barrister to carry out an independent probe,  despite Scotland Yard and the police watchdog, the IPCC, concluding last week they could find no new evidence.

Mark Ellison, QC, who earlier this year secured the conviction of David Norris and Gary Dobson for the 1993 racist gang murder, in Eltham - 19 years after the crime - will head the review.

The move was welcomed by Stephen’s mother Doreen, who had called for a fresh public inquiry after it was claimed the Metropolitan Police withheld paperwork about the extent of corruption from the Macpherson Inquiry.

Mrs Lawrence told the Independent: ‘Whilst I asked for a public inquiry into these allegations, my discussions with the Home Secretary have reassured me that the independent review she has ordered will seek to deal with my concerns.

‘This is because firstly, it will be conducted by someone independent of both the police and the IPCC, organisations in which I have little faith and confidence, and secondly, the person conducting the review, Mark Ellison, QC, is someone who has already shown his commitment in getting justice for me and my family.’

The scope of the inquiry and the barrister who will be in charge have not yet been decided.

A Home Office spokesman said: ‘The Home Secretary has asked for a QC-led review of the work the Metropolitan Police has undertaken into investigating claims of corruption in the original Stephen Lawrence murder investigation.’

The Met launched a review to examine the claims, while the Independent Police Complaints Commission reviewed its 2006 investigation into complaints following the broadcast that year of the BBC programme The Boys Who Killed Stephen Lawrence.

Officers from the Met's Directorate of Professional Standards looked at thousands of documents, many dating from the 1980s, from Met Police archives and from government archives in Kew, and spoke to serving and retired officers as well as the junior counsel for the MPS at the inquiry.

The review found that no investigations, nor the inquiry, uncovered evidence of corruption or collusion which could have hampered or influenced the original or subsequent investigations.

It also found that the force disclosed all material relating to ‘adverse information’ it had about three officers of concern, including those the claims surrounded.

There was no other material known to 
be held by the force which suggested that corruption or collusion 
impacted on the initial investigation into Mr Lawrence's murder, and 
there are no new allegations from the recent claims, the force said.

Any allegations or suggestions had already been investigated by the Met and IPCC, it said.

The
police watchdog said its review followed reports on allegations made by
former Met Police officer Neil Putnam about the relationship between 
former Detective Sergeant John Davidson and Clifford Norris, David 
Norris's father.

But on Thursday the IPCC also said it found that no new information or evidence has been made available which would lead to a change in the conclusions reached by its original investigation into allegations made by the BBC documentary.

Suspicion had fallen on the conduct and integrity of 
former Metropolitan Police commander Ray Adams, who was involved in the original murder investigation, and his relationship with
Kenneth Noye, who was later convicted of a separate murder.

No criminal or misconduct charges were brought as a result of the 
internal investigation into Mr Adams, who says he was exonerated and 
denies any wrongdoing.

He was questioned at the Macpherson inquiry about corruption, but no evidence of wrongdoing was found.

During the Macpherson inquiry, lawyers claimed Noye had a criminal 
associate, Clifford Norris, whose son David was a prime suspect in the 
murder of Stephen.

It has also been claimed that another Scotland Yard officer, who 
interviewed the suspects following Stephen’s killing, had links to 
Clifford Norris.

A leaked 
Scotland Yard report alleged Detective Sergeant John Davidson, one of 
the lead investigators in the initial botched inquiry, received corrupt 
payments from Clifford Norris.

Those allegations were investigated by
the IPCC which found no evidence that corruption had affected the 
inquiry. Mr Davidson, has always denied wrongdoing.

The Met investigation into Adams, 
codenamed Operation Russell, began in April 1987 when he was working as 
the force's head of criminal intelligence, according to the Guardian.

It
was triggered by allegations that he had taken bribes from criminals 
and had improper relationships with criminal informants - something he 
strongly denied.

There are claims that a confidential report 
compiled by Scotland Yard's anti-corruption command was not disclosed to
the panel of the 1998 Macpherson inquiry that examined the forces 
handling of the Stephen Lawrence case

Shadow home secretary Yvette Cooper said: ‘I believe it is right that an independent review is undertaken into allegations of corruption at the time of the original investigation into the murder of Stephen Lawrence.

‘However I also feel that 13 years after the Macpherson report we should not only confront these allegations of corruption, but publicly review progress made in eliminating racism in the police service.

‘It was clear before the internal review undertaken by the Metropolitan Police into corruption and the Lawrence case that a public inquiry was needed.

‘So too it is clear that internal reports and work, though worthwhile, are not sufficient in such an important case.

‘After the history of problems in this case, everything possible should be done and be seen to be done to ensure the fullest possible confidence in the police investigations.’
