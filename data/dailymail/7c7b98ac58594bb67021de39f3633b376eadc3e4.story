Not a single office in London's Shard has been filled, a year after the building was inaugurated, it has been revealed.

While tourists and diners have flocked to the 360 degree viewing platform and sky-high restaurants at what is Europe's tallest building, big businesses have been somewhat less enthused.

It is thought just 10 per cent of the skyscraper's 25-floors of office space have been let, with any firms not expected to move in until next year.

The Shard has been a hit with tourists and diners, who have flocked to its viewing platforms and restaurants, but its 25 floors of office space remain empty a year after the building's inauguration

Unrivaled experience: Tourists have flocked to the Shard to experience the viewing platform and the building's three restaurants but it has struggled to attract businesses so far

Just 12 months ago London mayor 
Boris Johnson confidently predicted the Shard would 'act as a huge 
commercial magnet, creating vital new jobs and bringing in scores of 
businesses'. 

There have been rumours a number of high-profile firms are on the brink of moving in, including financial advisers Duff & Phelps, Arabic TV channel Al-Jazeera and another Middle-Eastern company, South Hook Gas.

But even if deals have been agreed, that would only mean about three of the floors being taken.

Information on rents and prospective tenants is a closely-guarded secret, but it is thought the amount of prospective tenants pale in comparison to other new buildings in London, such as the Cheesegrater and Walkie-Talkie towers, which are 50 per cent let before construction has even finished.

But Irvine Sellar, the developer behind the 72-storey structure, remains confident businesses will soon be moving in.

Confident: Boris Johnson said the Shard would be a 'commercial magnet' when he openedlast year, left. Irvine Sellar, the building's developer, says that remains the case and expects firms to move in next year

Imposing: The Shard is the dominant feature in London's skyline and is Europe's tallest skyscraper, with 72 floors

He told The Times: 'We have signed up a few tenants and are in discussion with a number of others and we will make a decision when we are ready. We are taking our time, as we don't just want to fill the Shard up with accountants or lawyers.'

Mr Sellar added the business plan for the building allowed for the first leases to be signed as late as 2014, and was in 'no hurry' to get firms on board before then.

The cost of running a skyscraper is astronomical, with cleaning windows costing about £150,000 a year alone

Powering the building involves 'pre-booking' a block amount of electricity from the grid that has to be paid for even if it is not to be used.

Office tenants also pay a service charge for items like cleaning and security, which one consultant said could come to as much as £9 million a year when the Shard is fully let.

More than half a million tickets have been sold for the building's viewing platform

The consultant, who didn't want to be named, told the paper Mr Sellar is taking a 'determined stance' on who he would allow in the building and said it was 'bold' he hadn't held a launch specifically for the property market.

But he backed him to succeed because demand for office space in London continues to grow.

'The prospects for the Shard look better than when it completed last year,' he said.

Mr Sellar said more than half a million tickets had been sold for the viewing platforms and added: 'The Shard has been a long time coming. But this is a building that is going to last a few centuries.'

The businessman is also developing the building next door, The Place, which, together with its imposing neighbour, make up what is known as the London Bridge Quarter.
