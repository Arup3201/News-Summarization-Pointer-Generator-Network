And the centre is asking members of the public to send in any unwanted pet toys so every dog can have something to play with this Christmas.

A recent study done by The Co-operative found that but 15 per cent of pet owners claim their four-legged friends really do realise it’s Christmas - because they recognise wrapping paper.

Debbie Chapman, media manager at Battersea Dogs Home, said: 'The photos are to raise awareness of the thousands of dogs in shelters like Battersea that are homeless this Christmas. 

'This is a litter of puppies that has recently become homeless and come into our care.
