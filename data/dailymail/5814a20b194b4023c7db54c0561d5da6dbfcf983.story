A New Jersey household has added a few new members to the family after a colony of bats set up residence between the screen and storm window of a bedroom.

The Williams family, of Hunterdon County, has enjoyed the nocturnal additions so much they've even set up a live video stream of the bats. 

The bedroom is where the family's two young boys sleep.

'I don't feel at all scared,' Matthew Williams tells WABC-TV. 'This is like being at the zoo. And you're just on the other side of a window.'

Williams says he also makes a YouTube video of the bat's activity every day. He even sees mother bats drop their babies off. 

'One of the neat things I've discovered is they have hands like people,' he said. 'And you can actually see almost the relationship between our hand to the bat wing, up close.'

He says his sons even enjoy the visitors.

'Sometimes they'll squeak and they'll wiggle around, and the boys love it,' he says. 'For us, it's like having pets.'

Wife Sharon Ingarra said she things they're cute.

The colony's survival is also exciting as roughly 6 million bats have died from an illness called White Nose Syndrome since 2009

'Yeah, we had babies in the springtime, two babies,' she said. 'One survived. And they were just adorable. I mean, for bats.'
