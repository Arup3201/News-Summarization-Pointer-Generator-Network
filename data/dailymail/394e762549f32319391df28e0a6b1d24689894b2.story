QPR continued their preparation for their return to the Premier League with a 2-2 draw at Leyton Orient.

The Hoops looked on course to record a 2-1 victory at the home of fellow London side Orient, after goals from Junior Hoilett and Joey Barton put them in front following Romain Vincelot's early opener.

But a Dean Cox strike six minutes from time denied a Harry Redknapp side without Rio Ferdinand victory at the Matchroom Stadium.

Back of the net: Joey Barton gave QPR a 2-1 lead with a curling free-kick two minutes into the second half

Ferdinand was just one of many admissions from the QPR team, but Redknapp still fielded a fairly strong side with Charlie Austin, Barton and new arrival Steven Caulker all handed starts.

And it was the former Cardiff defender who was caught napping early on as he was beaten to a right wing cross by Vincelot who powerfully headed the League One side into a 10th minute lead.

It was a deserved lead for the Os but QPR soon hit back nine minutes through Hoilett.

The winger took one touch to set himself before firing an effort into the bottom left-hand corner with a 20 yard effort.Â 

Barton saw an effort deflected over shortly after but soon turned the game on its head for the Hoops, with a sweetly struck free-kick two minutes after the break.

The Hoops looked like they would hold on for a second pre-season win of the season but Dean Cox found space before slotting home with his left foot from just inside the box with just six minutes to play.

Despite the late strike, a draw was just reward for Orient who matched QPR throughout the game even forcing Robert Green into a smart double stop just before the hour mark.
