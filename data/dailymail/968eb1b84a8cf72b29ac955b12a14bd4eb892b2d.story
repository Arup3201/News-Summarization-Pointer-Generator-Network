Proud recipient: Candeleda town hall chiefs said they named a main street after Mr Major because he has put it on the map by holidaying there for nearly 25 years

Former PM John Major has unveiled a street named after him in a small Spanish town - and claimed British tourists who flock to the Costas miss out on the 'real Spain'.

The ex-Conservative Party leader returned to his favourite holiday haunt of Candeleda two hours drive west of Madrid on Saturday to unveil Avenida de John Major - John Major Avenue in English.

Town hall chiefs announced earlier this month they intended naming a main street after Mr Major because he has put it on the map by holidaying there for nearly 25 years. 

He stays at a country home near the town which friend and former Conservative Party colleague Tristan Garel-Jones’ Spanish wife inherited from her late father.

In a thank you speech ahead of the unveiling ceremony, Mr Major said: 'Up to one million of my fellow British citizens have a house in Spain and somewhere between 13 and 14 million British tourists visit Spain every year, the largest number of tourists from any country by a very long way.

'Most of them come to enjoy your beautiful seaside and island resorts but I’ve learnt differently.

'I would urge them to venture into real Spain.

'They will find not only magnificent cities, part of our common European heritage, but a whole range of stunningly beautiful towns and villages of which Candeleda is to me, is one of the jewels.'

The former PM, wearing a shirt and jacket despite the searing heat, was accompanied by wife Norma and ex Tory Cabinet ministers Douglas Hogg and Ian Lang.

He admitted his Spanish was limited to ‘gracias’ because like most Brits he was an 'idle, lazy linguist.'

Mr Garel-Jones, Minister for Europe under John Major, translated his speech into Spanish so the 300 locals and dignitaries present could understand.

Mr Major said: 'In all countries political disagreements can run very deep but it’s important to remember there are some things that stand above the day-to-day political struggles.

'The town of Candeleda not only honours me but reminds us of that important principle.

'Today for me is a very special day. Candeleda is a very special place.

'My wife Norma and I look forward to coming here many times in the future.'

Candeleda, a popular weekend destination for tourists from Madrid, boasts one of Spain’s highest mountains, the 8,500 Almanzor peak which Major can see from his holiday home when he stays.

Peas - his favourite food in the famous Spitting Image sketch of the former PM - might not be on the menu in most of its restaurants.

But it is famous for its goats cheese and roast goat kid as well as its paprika.

Olmedo, where Nick Clegg holidays every summer with his Spanish wife and their three kids, is just a two-hour drive drive away in the neighbouring province of Valladolid.

A monolith next to an old tobacco fermentation centre has also been named after Mr Major, who is expected to stay in the area all week.

He first visited the town in 1989 when Tristan Garel-Jones invited him to stay at his country home.

He used to be flown by helicopter from Madrid’s Barajas Airport when he was holding the reins of power, but now makes the two-hour journey by car.

A Spanish couple that look after the house all-year-round cook for him while he is there, making his favourite sangria and gazpacho, a cold tomato soap.

His favourite pastimes include reading and trekking in the Tietar Valley south of the Gredos Mountains which draw holidaymakers to the protected area.

The avenue named after John Major is an amalgamation of two streets which include the old tobacco fermentation centre and a council-run sports complex and is soon set to become the HQ of the local police.

It is also the access road Mr Major uses to come into the town centre.

Councillor Rodrigo Munoz, spokesman for the local Popular Party which holds eight of the 13 council seats and proposed the street-naming idea, said: 'We obviously want to promote Candeleda and see this as an excellent way of achieving this objective.

'But it’s also our way of saying thank you to Mr Major for choosing to holiday in our town when he was Prime Minister and repeating year after year.

'He obviously likes it here and we’re delighted to receive him. 

'I’ve enjoyed a beer with him in the town hall square the last couple of times he’s been and he seems a very nice down-to-earth man who although he doesn’t speak Spanish can say the odd word.'
