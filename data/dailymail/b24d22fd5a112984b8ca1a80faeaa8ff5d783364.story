Scott is seen fighting back tears as he kneels down to tell his stepdaughter that he will always 'hold her hand', 'skip with her down the street' and 'bring comfort to her life'.

He continues:'I vow to make you say your prayers before you eat. I promise to read you stories at night and to always tuck you in real tight. 

'I vow to show you how a man should treat a woman in my relationship with your mother. And above all else, I vow to protect you, care for you and love you forever.'

Many viewers have applauded the Idaho native for his choice of words.

'This is the realest most wonderful thing ever! Ladies find yourself such a man! Men, learn and get inspired!' one fan exclaimed.

Scott and Kay tied the knot on a snowy day at the luxury Shore Lodge resort in McCall, Idaho.

They later jetted off to Tahiti and Bora Bora for a two-week honeymoon.  

Kay's daughter Brielle, from a previous relationship, followed them down the aisle as a flower girl and she even had her own little diamond ring.

Scott told the Huffington Post that he was surprised how emotional he got when he addressed his two special ladies.

'I always felt like my vows to my wife Whitney would maybe affect me more and I would get more choked up during those, making those promises to her.

'But I misread that one. It was really when I was reading my vows to Brielle that I got the most choked up. 

'It really all just hits home in that moment - you're there and dressed up and all the people around. You get engulfed by it.'
