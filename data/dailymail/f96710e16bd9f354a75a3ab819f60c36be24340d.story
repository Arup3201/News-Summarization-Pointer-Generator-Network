A child porn suspect who allegedly enrolled his 17-year-old accomplice in elementary school to lure victims was investigated two years ago following an incident at an aquarium, it was revealed on Monday. 

Randy Wesson, 28, was suspended from his job as an 'education associate' at Sea Life Aquarium in Grapevine, Texas after he allegedly tried to pick up a four-year-old boy and offered his services for babysitting to the child's mother.

The woman, from Arlington, wrote to the aquarium's management to complain about the employee's behavior in February 2012.

According to a police report seen by MailOnline, Wesson gave the mother his card and said that he was also available as a babysitter, saying he had experience having worked with Christian youth ministries. 

The woman, who was not identified, wrote: 'In my head, all I heard was, ''I want to molest your son, and groom him with Christianity and aquatic sea life.''' 

Wesson was suspended and then resigned the next day, police reported. 

Following an investigation, police were unable to arrest Wesson because there was no evidence of a crime and the case was closed. 

In the course of the investigation, an aquarium colleague of Wesson said he revealed that he had been working with young people at church ministries but had quit because some of the clergy made accusations that he was 'too friendly' towards some youth he was working with.

Suspected pedophile Randy Wesson resigned from the Sea Life Aquarium in Grapevine, Texas in 2012 after a mother complained to management because he approached her wanting to babysit her son 

The co-worker also said Wesson had told her 'out of the blue' that he had been sexually abused as a child.

Last Tuesday, Wesson was arrested in Fort Worth after police following a tip-off about child porn. 

Investigators said he admitted to sexually abusing more than 100 children between the ages of 7 and 14.

According to an arrest affidavit, detectives said Wesson 'confessed that police would find approximately 42,000 child pornography images on his computer, thumb drive, phone and SD cards'.

Ricardo Javid Lugo, 17, was also arrested after he allegedly enrolled in the sixth grade at Hurst Hills Elementary School in August using fake documents while  Wesson posed as his father to possibly groom victims.  

During a search of Lugo's phone, officers found images of 'children at school, dated August 25 through 26, 2014'.

A video on Lugo's cell phone dated August 31, 2014, showed Lugo spanking a child who appeared in a previous photograph taken at school, reported NBC DFW. 

In one message, Lugo told Wesson that he saw one child's genitals and 'talks about telling other kids not to tell, and having to follow them home to see where they live,' according to the affidavit. 

Police were investigating the number of victims and have asked parents at the school to talk to their children. 

An investigation revealed that Ricardo Javis Lugo, 17, has been enrolled in sixth grade at Hurst Hills Elementary in Texas since August and may have done so to capture child pornography

According to the arrest affidavit, Lugo (pictured left and right) and Wesson met on Instagram in 2013 when Lugo was using the name Matthew and living in Mexico

The elementary school has also provided counselors to try to find out if any children were targeted.

The investigation into Wesson began in June after at online tip was received by the National Center for Missing and Exploited Children, connecting child porn with the username 'littleboy8' and an email address. This was found to be linked to Wesson. 

Posts using the email address were made in a 'bedwetting forum', according to the star-telegram.com. The man indentified himself as a '26 years old daddy' looking for a 'baby boy'.

According to the affidavit, one post read: 'I want to change you (wet or messy) feed you bathe you and play with you. I am looking for temporary or permanent. I want my baby to be smooth and under 21. My baby will be treated like a real baby.' 

Police tracked down Wesson in November after the detective in charge of the case went on medical leave for several months. 

When police got in touch with Wesson's father, Bruce Wesson, he cooperated and told investigators that he thought his son was gay and may have looked at child pornography. 

Bruce Wesson said that his son Randy showed up at his home in February with a 12-year-old boy he called Matthew whom he claimed that his mother did not want anymore. 

Bruce Wesson said that Matthew would not talk about his past, was six feet tall - but still wore diapers to bed.

Lugo and Randy Wesson reportedly met on Instagram last year when Lugo was using the name Matthew and living in Mexico. 

Wesson told investigators he and Lugo have had a sexual relationship since that time.

Hurst-Euless-Bedford Independent School District said Lugo enrolled in August.

District officials said Wesson posed as Lugo's father during the process and provided a birth certificate, immunization records and proof of residency.

'Hurst Hills staff followed all procedures regarding enrollment when the student was enrolled in August,' the statement read. 

'There was no indication that the student's records were forged or that the student was too old to attend elementary school.'    

Randy Wesson is due in court on Tuesday morning to face federal charges of distribution of child pornography.

Lugo is being held in Hurst Jail on $250,000 bail where he faces a charge of child pornography.
