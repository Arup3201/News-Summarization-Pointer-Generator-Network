Waiting times in A&E departments have hit record levels for the second week running with tens of thousands of patients left for up to 19 hours.

Relatives described corridors resembling ‘military field hospitals’ with patients lining up on chairs or trolleys because there were no beds available.

Senior doctors in some hospitals say the situation is as bad as they have ever known and fear it will intensify over the winter. NHS figures show that last week was the worst since records began in November 2010 – with 44,883 patients spending more than four hours in A&E before it was decided whether they should be admitted. It is the second week running that waiting times hit record levels.

A further 10,136 patients whom doctors decided should be taken on to wards had to wait on trolleys for at least four hours because there were no beds.

This is the highest figure on record and more than double the number for the same week last year, which was just under 4,000.

The Government’s target is that 95 per cent of A&E patients should be either discharged or admitted within four hours. Last week only 89.8 per cent was achieved. In one case, an 82-year-old with motor neurone disease was left for 19 hours on a trolley in a corridor at Hull Royal Infirmary, East Yorkshire. The family of John Mant complained to hospital managers, who promised to investigate.

At Tameside A&E unit, Tony Price, a senior IT expert at Hewlett Packard, described ‘chaos’ on Wednesday night and said corridors resembled a ‘military field hospital.’

Writing on Twitter, he said his partner Mandy had been waiting 17-and-a-half hours with other patients on chairs or trolleys in a corridor.

The crisis is partly due to hospitals being unable to discharge elderly patients as there are so few places in care homes. This leads to a bed shortage in wards, which means patients cannot be moved out of A&E. On top of this, rising numbers of patients are turning up at hospitals because they cannot get an appointment with their GP.

Andy Burnham,  Shadow Health Secretary, said: ‘This was the worst week in A&E in many years'

Andy Burnham, Labour’s Shadow Health Secretary, said: ‘This was the worst week in A&E in many years.

‘All over England, emergency services are stretched to the limit. Seriously ill people are waiting hours for ambulances to arrive or on trolleys in hospital corridors. This is before the winter has begun in earnest.’

Dr Mark Porter, chairman of the British Medical Association’s council, which represents doctors, said: ‘Staff are working flat out but the system is really struggling to cope with the sheer number of patients coming through the door.

‘Growing pressure on services throughout the year means hospitals have no spare capacity to deal with the winter spike in demand.

‘So patients are enduring delays in their treatment, and the NHS finds itself running just to stand still.’

Dr Peter Carter, of the Royal College of Nursing, said: ‘Our health service is running at full capacity and the strain on the system is immense.

‘The fear is that as the festive period gets underway, A&Es are set to get even busier and performance could deteriorate further.’

Earlier this week, a senior A&E consultant at Cambridge University Hospitals said the pressures were the worst he had known.

Dr Adrian Boyle told ITV News there is ‘absolutely a winter crisis’, adding that the NHS is ‘going to have a very, very tough winter’.

Last month the Government announced it was injecting an extra £700million into the NHS to help stave off a winter crisis.

The money is intended to pay for extra staff and beds but senior doctors say it is merely a ‘sticking plaster’ and too little, too late.

Dr Barbara Hakin, national director of commissioning operations for NHS England, said: ‘Pressures on our A&E services continue to increase significantly. We have admitted more people to hospital this week to take care of them than in any previous week on record. I want to pay tribute to the staff dealing with that – they are doing a brilliant job.’
