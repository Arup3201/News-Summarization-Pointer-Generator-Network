Staff had to be on their guard at Gold Coast Airport in Australia this morning when a snake came within inches of getting onto a plane.

As passengers began to settle into their seats aboard the Virgin flight to Sydney, a green snake slithered its way up the stairs to the entry door.

Eagle-eyed passenger Stuart Robert, who rather fittingly works as the Assistant Minister for Defence, was on hand to capture the action unfold.

The snake was halted just inches from entering the main body of the plane by airport staff

'The green snake had slithered up the front stairs so the passengers had to board from the back,' he told MailOnline Travel. 

'It was probably enjoying the warmth of the tarmac and steel and may have made its way up there as people were boarding.

'I took the photo just as the staff had got the little guy into a bag, so it wasn't quite 'Snakes on a Plane' and we didn't have an extra passenger to Sydney.' 

MP Robert was full of praise for the way the drama was handled by staff at Gold Coast Airport. 

Delays were minimal at Gold Coast Airport today after a snake was halted entering a plane on the tarmac

'The airport staff acted quickly and brought a bag with a rod to gather up the little guy and probably take him back to where he came from. 

'They responded well and the delay was minor.'

It is not known as to what kind of snake it was. Staff were expected to return the reptile back to its natural habitat.
