Dead but not gone: Government officials were quick to distance the project from the city's most famous former resident, insisting it is simply a drive to boost tourism to the region

The town where Osama Bin Laden was killed by US Navy SEALs is to become the new home of a £19million ($30 million) 'amusement city' complete with a zoo, water sports and mini-golf, Pakistan's government has announced.

The 20-hectare riverside development on the edge of Abbottabad will also house a string of restaurants, a ski ramp and even a snake pit for tourists' amusement.

However, government officials were quick to distance the project from the city's most famous former resident, insisting it is simply a drive to boost tourism to the region.

Bin Laden died in a hail of bullets 
as American Special Forces stormed his secret lair on the outskirts of 
Abbottabad on May 2 2011.

'The amusement city will be built on 
50 acres in the first phase but later will be extended to 500 acres,' 
Syed Aqil Shah, the provincial minister for tourism and sports, told 
AFP.

'It will have a heritage park, wildlife zoo, food street, adventure and paragliding clubs, waterfalls and jogging tracks.'

Work is due to begin in late February or early March, he said, and will take eight years to complete.

The unassuming military town of Abbottabad, named after James Abbott, the British 
major who founded the town in 1853, has such a pleasant climate that it
is a major hub for tourists visiting the region.

But after Bin Laden was found lurking
behind ten foot walls in a secret hideout, there were fears that thousands 
of Al Qaeda sympathisers could flock to the spot where he was shot.

'Bin Laden Tours': While the three-storey building in which bin Laden was killed has since been knocked down to prevent pilgrimages by Islamist extremists , his memory lives on in Abbottabad

But while the three-storey building 
in which bin Laden was killed has since been knocked down to prevent 
such pilgrimages, his memory lives on and, behind the scenes, officials 
are desperate to re-brand the town as the tourist hotspot it once was.

That he had been living under the Pakistani government's nose for so long was also a major embarrassment, one politicians will be keen to forget.

The town also houses Pakistan's elite military academy and the discovery of the world's most wanted man on its doorstep prompted allegations of incompetence or complicity between the armed forces and the 9/11 mastermind.

But Mr Shah insisted the new development was simply about promoting tourism, not polishing the town's tarnished image.

'This project has nothing to do with Osama bin Laden,' he told AFP.

'We are working to promote tourism and amusement facilities in the whole province and this project is one of those facilities.'
