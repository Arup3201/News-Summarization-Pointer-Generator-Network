Police dashboard-mounted cameras normally catch the worst of human behavior.

But one fixed in a patrol car has captured the heart-warming moment an officer took time out of crime fighting to play football with a lonely youngster.

Footage from the in-car camera was uploaded by Rosenberg Police Department in Texas to their Facebook page, with the caption: 'While a 2 minute game of football might not mean anything, to some it could mean everything!'

All alone: The youngster is spotted playing by himself in a residential car park in Rosenberg, Texas

The video of the touching incident, which took place on Saturday afternoon in a residential car park, has now gone viral - being shared more than 4,000 times in the first few hours.

The officer has been praised for reaching out to the community and helping to engage with the 10-year-old, who now says he wants to be a policeman or a professional football player.

Posting comments on the police force's Facebook page under the video, Billy Mulligan said: 'You guys have got community policing nailed down perfectly.  

Play time: The officer leaves his car and asks the youngster to throw him the ball

Catch: The officer fires off a few of his best throws for the 10-year-old to catch

'The way you showcase the good work you do should be replicated in forces everywhere. Too many are too scared to show the human side of the uniform. Keep doing what you do best!'

Laura Navarro added: 'I love it!!!! I was watching from my office across the street and I was touched...'

Not all of the 449 comments were in 
praise of the officer's community engagement techniques, with some accusing him of wasting police time.

However,
 David Craven said: 'I'm responding to two comments about wasting tax 
payers money. You really need to think about that because the officer 
just saved you money.

'The impression this officer left on that young man will last forever.

Praise: Within hours of the footage of the officer playing with the lonely child, it had been shared more than 4,000 times across social media

Community spirit: The youngster says he now wants to be a police officer or a professional football player

'The likelihood of this young man getting involved in crime took a sharp dive down. He will look at the police differently and probably not get in trouble which YES will save you money not being in jail wasting YOUR hard earned tax dollars.

'Great job for looking at the future officer's. As for the above two listed individuals, get off you computer, grab a football, walk outside and wait for someone to change your life. WE ARE ON OUR WAY.'
