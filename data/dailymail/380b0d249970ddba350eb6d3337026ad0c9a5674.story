Passengers aboard a Frontier Airlines flight were delayed for hours after the plane struck a fence moments before take-off at one of the busiest airports in the US.

The plane’s wing became stuck in the fence at Chicago’s O’Hare International Airport as the aircraft was taxiing to a runway for its journey to Washington, D.C., on Tuesday night.

Passengers said the aircraft was stuck for nearly two hours before it was towed back to a gate.

Passenger Himani Chaudhary told NBC Chicago: ‘Within a few minutes of starting [to leave] the flight just stopped.

‘We were wondering what had happened but we realized the wing was stuck in the fence.

‘It was really frustrating because you know by the time we were supposed to be in D.C. we were just sitting stuck at the airport.

‘They left us sitting with me, and other passengers with kids and things and it was hard. It was the first time I’ve seen something like this happening.’
