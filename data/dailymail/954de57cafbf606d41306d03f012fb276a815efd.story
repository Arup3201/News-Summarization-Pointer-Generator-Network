Twin baby girls abducted from a hospital have been rescued after police arrested nine suspects on suspicion of baby trafficking in northwestern China.

It comes after another baby taken from Fuping County Maternal and Child Health Care became the first to be reunited with his parents earlier this week following the arrest of the hospital's obstetrician

Zhang Shuxia is accused of abducting newborns from the hospital in Shaanxi province after convincing the parents to give them up by falsely claiming the infants were born with serious health conditions. 

Police have received 55 reports of child abductions and allege that Zhang was involved in 26 of them.

Three government officials and three hospital managers have also been fired over the baby trafficking scandal, the official Xinhua News Agency reported last night.

The twins were due to be reunited with their parents, mother Wang Yanyan and father Qi Kunfeng, today.

The parents told CNN that Zhang convinced them to give up the twins after their birth on May 29 by telling them they had serious health problems.

Wang, 31, said: 'The doctor was pretending to be very anxious, telling me that my babies have congenital problems. She said the twins would be brain damaged or paralyzed.

'I insisted on seeing the babies, but 
she wouldn't let me. I never suspected that she was selling my babies, 
because she was a family friend.'

Emotion: Dong Wan cries as she holds her newborn son after being reunited with him in hospital

Joy: Ms Dong, 31, is handed her baby after he was recovered from human traffickers

The parents described the obstetrician as 'evil' and a 'terrible' person. Qi said: 'We trusted her so much. How could she be so cruel to sell our babies?'

The other rescued baby boy was returned to his parents on Monday.

His mother Dong Wan, 31, wept as she held the boy at the hospital in Fuping.

The same doctor apparently told Ms Dong, 31, that her son was born with severe health problems and would soon die.

The healthy baby boy was tracked down by investigators after Dong became suspicious.

The
mother said: ‘I was told the baby would not survive and the best thing 
for me would be to let the hospital take care of it so I did.’

Relief: The mother had been tricked by her obstetrician into handing over her son to him

Crime: Ms Dong spoke of her pain at being tricked by the doctor she had previously trusted

After signing the documents at The Fuping County Maternal and Child Health Care Hospital, Dong changed her mind and begged her husband, Lai Guofeng, to call the police.

The baby was tracked down hundreds of
miles away in neighbouring Henan province where the original 
traffickers had sold him on for a profit.

He
had been sold for 21,600 yuan (£2,275 or $3,527) on July 17, the day 
after he was born. The baby was then sold two more times over the course
ofthe next ten days.

Despite severe legal punishments, including the death penalty, child trafficking is still a big problem in China.

It
is very profitable for the traffickers, and demand is strong, driven 
partly by the traditional preference for male heirs, a strict one-child 
policy and ignorance of the law.
