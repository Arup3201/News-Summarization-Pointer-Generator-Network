Think of the Premier League's fastest players and the likes of Alexis Sanchez, Raheem Sterling and Gabriel Agbonlahor are almost certain to spring to mind.

The trio frighten defenders with their pace and direct running, bursting into space and taking on opponents at lightning speed.

They are among the division's quickest, but cannot quite keep up with one man - Newcastle's Moussa Sissoko.

The Magpies powerhouse midfielder was clocked running at 35.3 kilometres per hour during his side's 1-0 win against Leicester in October - the fastest speed recorded by any player this season.

The 25-year-old, who has attracted interest from French giants Paris Saint-Germain, may not be renowned for his pace but he put the afterburners on against the Foxes to beat Crystal Palace's Wilfried Zaha by just 0.1kph.

The on-loan winger ran at a top speed of 35.2kph during the Eagles' 1-1 draw with Stoke in December, 0.1kph faster than West Ham's Stewart Downing and Leicester's Marcin Wasilewski have managed this season.

West Brom's Cristian Gamboa has only made 10 appearances so far but he, along with Tottenham's Eric Dier and Liverpool forward Sterling, has clocked up a 35kph sprint.

Speed merchant Sanchez ran at 34.6kph against Newcastle last month - 0.2kph slower than Agbonlahor did against Southampton - leaving him just off the pace of Everton's Ross Barkley (34.9kph) and Chelsea's Diego Costa (34.7kph).

Costa's top speed was matched by Manchester City forward Sergio Aguero when he faced Tottenham in mid-October and scored all of his side's goals in a 4-1 victory.

But it's not just speed that matters out on the pitch, it's also how much of it you're able to cover.

Mark Hughes has turned Stoke into a more stylish side since taking over from Tony Pulis in the summer of 2013, but the Potters remain one of the hardest-working teams in the Premier League.

That is perfectly illustrated by Steven N'Zonzi, who has covered 227 kilometres in his 20 appearances - the most by any player this season.

The Frenchman is a key part of Stoke's midfield and has played every minute of every top-flight game so far, helping Hughes' men to wins against champions Manchester City and Arsenal.

The former Blackburn man finds himself just ahead of Chelsea star Cesc Fabregas, who as well as providing a league-high 14 assists, has covered a massive 225.3km.

Another of the league's most creative players, Spurs' Christian Eriksen, has also shown he's not afraid to work hard for his manager, having run 222km - the equivalent of over five marathons.

Perhaps the most surprising name on our countdown is Robin van Persie, who has covered a greater distance than any other Manchester United player despite only completing 13 full games.

The Dutchman has managed 187.1km so far, although that is only enough to beat Manchester City's Yaya Toure (179.7km) and Leicester defender Paul Konchesky (173.1km).

A number of summer signings have been keen to impress during the first half of the season, with Burnley's George Boyd (213.2km), Newcastle's Jack Colback (22.4km), Southampton's Graziano Pelle (199.9km) and West Ham's Aaron Cresswell (211.5km) all having covered the greatest distance for their respective clubs.

Mathieu Flamini has only completed 12 games for Arsenal but he is still the Gunners most hard-working player, having covered 191km for Arsene Wenger's side.

While Everton's Gareth Barry, who turns 34 in February, is proving that age is no barrier after covering a bigger distance (198.2km) than any player in Roberto Martinez's squad.
