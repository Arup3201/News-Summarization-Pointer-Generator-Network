ABC got the wind knocked out of its sails Tuesday when Nielsen revealed the network's evening news ratings have not beaten NBC's for the first time in 263 weeks, as they'd previously believed.

News ratings for the week beginning September 29 were affected by a software error that created miscalculations of television viewership dating back to last March. 

Industry officials said the error meant ABC's viewership was consistently over-estimated.

ABC got the wind knocked out of its sails Tuesday when Nielsen revealed the network's evening news ratings have not beaten NBC's for the first time in 263 weeks, as they'd previously believed

Nielsen had said last week that ABC's 'World News Tonight' had averaged 8.42 million viewers for the affected week to 8.25 million for NBC's 'Nightly News.' NBC hadn't lost a week since 2009.

But in its review, Nielsen found that NBC actually won the week by 170,000 viewers.

Nielsen's statistics serve as the foundation for billions of dollars in advertising spending for the entire broadcast industry.

Nielsen executives said the errors only became apparent in the past few weeks when the beginning of a new television season meant more people were tuning in.

'The differences are small enough that those of us who look at these numbers every day and live by them didn't notice a difference,' said Patricia McDonough, Nielsen senior vice president for planning policy and analysis.

Both networks issued statements Tuesday. NBC’s said: “We are pleased that the corrected numbers confirm that ‘NBC Nightly News’ is the No. 1 news broadcast in America, and has been for the last 265 weeks.”

ABC’s said: “For us, it has always been about the viewer at the end of the day. ‘World News Tonight’ is in the tightest evening news race in several years and we’re honored the viewers are responding.”

The mistakes came up in adjustments Nielsen makes to its ratings each day between an early morning estimate of viewers and a more complete accounting that is released late in the afternoon. The morning estimate doesn't account for schedule changes in individual markets and sometimes doesn't assign some market results to individual networks.

NBC still #1: News ratings for the week beginning September 29 were affected by a software error that created miscalculations of television viewership dating back to last March.

It was discovered that all of the unassigned viewing was mistakenly being credited to ABC, making that network's afternoon viewership estimates consistently higher than those reported earlier in the day.

CBS research chief David Poltrack said his network became suspicious upon looking at ratings for 'Dancing with the Stars' on Sept. 22. Two big ABC affiliates, in New York and Chicago, carried the 'Monday Night Football' game that night between the Chicago Bears and New York Jets instead of 'Dancing.' When Nielsen adjusted its ratings to account for two large markets that did not carry 'Dancing,' it stood to reason that the show's ratings would drop with the more detailed afternoon accounting.

Instead, the 'Dancing With the Stars' afternoon numbers went up. CBS began noticing a pattern of ABC ratings being adjusted upward in the afternoon and called it to Nielsen's attention, Poltrack said.

It's unclear whether the errors are significant enough to impact advertising spending, which is based on Nielsen's estimates of how many people are watching individual shows. Nielsen said that in more than 98 percent of programs, the difference was 0.05 of a ratings point or lower.
