A quick thinking bus driver proved a real hero on Wednesday when her vehicle caught fire and she managed to get all 38 middle school students on board to safety before the bus became engulfed in flames.

Kristina Behrman, 31, was driving her bus along Interstate 4 in Polk County, Florida, at about 7:25 a.m. when it began to experience mechanical problems and smoke started emitting from the back.

Remaining calm under pressure, Behrman - who is a math teacher and substitute bus driver - pulled her vehicle over to the shoulder of the interstate and quickly mobilized her students to exit the bus in a quick and orderly fashion.

‘I was driving down the interstate and all of a sudden my bus started smoking and now my bus is in flames,’ she told emergency services after calling 911.

On the same call she can also be heard giving her students strict instructions to ensure everyone’s safety. Behrman  pulled over just in time as the entire vehicle then caught fire.

‘There were still three kids on the bus when flames started coming,’ she told WTSP.

One driver passing the scene managed to capture footage of the fire on a cell phone. The video shows the flames shooting into the sky and barrels of smoke filling the air.

The heavy smoke was so bad it forced Florida Highway Patrol to close the highway in both directions causing traffic back-ups for hours.

'This could have been pretty bad. We could have had a tragic situation, but the bus driver was instrumental in pulling over. Once she started to smell gas and smoke, with that combination, she did a fabulous job,’ Sgt. Mary Godino of the Florida Highway Patrol told WESH.

But Behrman was more modest about her achievement.

‘I didn't do anything any other, I hope, bus driver or teacher would do. We go to work every day and we're there to educate and protect. That's what we do that's what we live for,’ she said.

A replacement bus allowed the students to resume their trip to Discovery Academy, a technology charter school in Lake Alfred.

A tow truck also arrived to remove the burnt-out shell of Behrman’s bus. She has had to get a new driver's license after hers burned on the bus.
