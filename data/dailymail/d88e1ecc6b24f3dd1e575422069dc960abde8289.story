Manchester City striker Edin Dzeko found time out on a visit to homeland Bosnia and Herzegovina to visit a fledgling football school.

The 28-year-old went out of his way to make a trip to the Walter football school, which is located in his home city of Sarajevo.

He is one of a few players who have gone to the place, with this including his nation’s captain and Bayer Leverkusen centre-back Emir Spahic.

Surprise: Edin Dzeko returned to his home city Sarajevo, to meet local children at the Walter football school

The foundation was established in March 2011, with their website stating their aim is “to improve team skills, development of tolerance and fairness, as well as social competence.”

During his visit, Dzeko posed for photographs with, and signed autographs for, the star-struck youngsters. In return, the institution gave the former Wolfsburg man a Brazuca, the official 2014 World Cup ball, as well as a painting.

The forward attributed to his surprise visit there by retweeting a few photographs of him with the football school.

He is regarded as a superstar there, with his 36 goals for his country making him their record international goalscorer.
