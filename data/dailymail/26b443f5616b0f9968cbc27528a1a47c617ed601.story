This is the moment a brazen thief calmly walked into a pensioner's home and stole a 'substantial amount of money' as the victim pottered around in the garden just yards away.

CCTV footage shows the burglar sneaking into the house through a side gate while the 89-year-old homeowner tends to the garden outside his property in the Gorton area of Manchester.

The video, released by police today in a bid to help catch the intruder, then shows the offender casually walking out of the front door of the property after raiding the home for cash.

CCTV footage shows the intruder sneaking into the house (pictured) through a side gate while the 89-year-old homeowner potters around outside his property in the Gorton area of Manchester at about 1pm on October 16

The suspect walked through the side gate before entering the property and taking a 'substantial' sum of cash

The 89-year-old homeowner was completely unaware of the incident, despite being just yards from the thief

Police said he made off with a 'substantial' sum of money, despite the burglary taking place right under the nose of the homeowner.

In the footage, the victim can be seen in his front garden, before the offender walks through a side gate to gain access to the property. 

The pensioner then moves to the side of the house as the intruder escapes through the front door.

Officers have now released CCTV footage of the incident, in a bid to identify the man who they wish to speak to in connection with the burglary.

PC Rebecca Rudden, of Greater Manchester Police, said the burglary, which occurred at about 1pm on October 16, was a 'targeted attack'.

She said: 'We believe a man may have been acting as a look-out at a nearby bus stop while another walked into the home. 

The homeowner, who was gardening at the time of the incident, can be seen in the far left of the frame tipping out some rubbish, while the thief calmly walks out of the front door (top) and down the drive onto the road

'The victim was bent down gardening and did not see the man walk in.

'When he left, the 89-year-old was in the back garden and had not realised what happened.

'I would urge people to take a good look at the person in the image and if they recognise them, call police.

'This was a targeted attack against an elderly gentleman who had been saving and a substantial amount of money was taken.' 

Anyone with information should contact Greater Manchester Police on 101.
