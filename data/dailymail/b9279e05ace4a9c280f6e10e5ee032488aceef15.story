The reputation of music festivals as exhausting, if not exhilarating, events got a shake up this week as Soundwave Music Festival announced it's plan for an over-30's 'comfort zone' for weary revelers.

While festivals might traditionally be associated with long days in the baking sun fueled by energy drinks and caffeine, this year's Soundwave will cater to its older demographic, providing must-needed respite in the form of bean bags, chilled beverages, and even remedial massage.

In a move which sounds more in line with a red carpet than a moshpit, festival creator and promoter AJ Maddah announced the comfort zone after one of his Twitter followers suggested an 'oldies lounge' as a place to rest her legs.

'In the UK and in Europe most of the festivals have a two-day format, where people camp and if it all gets too much they can go and rest,' AJ told Daily Mail Australia.

'Now that Soundwave has moved to two days, holding the festival in an urban environment made people concerned about handling two days of action without respite,' he said.

With reports of brawling at last years Stereosonic Festival, deaths on the way to Falls Festival over New Years, and heightened concern over recreational drug use, many one-day festivals have seen ticket sales plummet. 

When Twitter user Jo, a mother and music lover, suggested an 'oldies lounge (shaded area with seats)' along with 'proof of age for entry' AJ jumped on the idea as a solution that would perfectly fit the direction he wanted the festival to move in.

'When she suggested it, it was a lightbulb moment. I just thought, let's do this. Let's create a really great space where people can get their breath back, grab a quality coffee or gelato, sit on bean bags and have all the comforts of home,' he said. 

'Things have happened really quickly, but we've already had so many things fall into place.'

The comfort zone is all set to have a massage therapist, a gelato bar, and a fine wine tasting bar, which AJ is hoping 'to serve in glassware'.

'It's going to be really civilised, I'm taking this very personally. I want people to feel like they're at home,' he said.

Despite announcing the zone as initially for over 35's, and then for over 30's, AJ said the zone will only be restricted for those under 18.

'We don't want the space filling up with teenagers, but we're not going to enforce the age apart from that,' he said. 

'A lot of people these days spend more time inside and just aren't used to a full day outside, and so this is also another way for us to adapt to our demographic.' 

Jo, who first suggested the idea and attends the festival with her partner, said that it came as a welcome surprise that her suggestion had been taken seriously.

'It's a full on day, and in previous years our bodies have been knackered afterwards. Soundwave is definitely an all-ages event, and Judas Priest has been playing for almost 50 years so it stands to reason that there are a lot of older fans,' Jo said.

'They probably have fans who would love to come, but physically don't think they're up to a full day on their feet in the sun,' she said.

Jo said that reports of brawls can often hurt the reputation of music festivals, which seem like they are 'for the young' and can put people off attending. 

The move was met with delight by many who had bought tickets to the Australian festival, who suggested many of the ideas that have now been introduced to the zone.

'Works for me I'm 51, act like I'm 21, with a sometimes a body of a 70 year old...Throw in a masseuse and I'm in,' said one Twitter user. 

At least one Twitter user was already clamboring to buy tickets for the 'reverse daycare but with amenities'. 

'It's been years since I've done a festival without considering a nap, I'm only 30 now.' 

While no official pricing has been set, a preliminary estimate of $15 to $20 for tickets for the comfort zone was floated by AJ, who will be holding a planning meeting on Monday which he will live tweet

Jo said that while she always enjoys Soundwave, which she calls 'the highlight of her music year', and has found the festival to be well-run, clean, and friendly, she was glad to have somewhere to sit down and rest out of the sun. 

'I would have been happy with shade and seats.  But a dedicated bar, tables to eat at, an upmarket toilet are all good. And if someone wants to massage us while we're there, we'll they're more than welcome,' Jo said.

'At the end of the day we want people to get the most out of their experience. It's a pretty hectic day and that's another reason for people to have an oasis to run away to,' he said.

'We don't have any filler bands, so the line up is stellar, and we want to give people somewhere they can recharge which helps them get back out there,' he said.
