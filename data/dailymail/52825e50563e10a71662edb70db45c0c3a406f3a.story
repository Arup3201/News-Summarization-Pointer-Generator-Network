Vladimir Putin maybe facing relentless Western criticism, but on the beaches in recently annexed Crimea, young Russian women are only too happy to wear him close to their hearts.

The ‘Putinkinis’ are the latest manifestation of fervent patriotism sweeping Russia as the country is hit by sanctions over the Ukraine crisis.

The pictures were taken at the Tavrida International Youth Meeting held this week on the Black Sea peninsula annexed from Ukraine by Russia in March.

‘Our wonderful girls decided not to hide their patriotism and show a photo of V.V Putin as one of their attributes - on their breasts,’ explained the event's website.

They aim with their swim wear ‘to say to all the country that they fully support the political course of head of the state Vladimir Vladimirovich Putin.

‘All this women power will stand for the protection of Russia's interests. Volodya (Putin), we are with you.’

The ‘Putinkini’ stunt is said to have been initiated by one of the women posing in the tiny white swimwear.

Anastasia Petrova, 20, who posted the pictures, is head of Department of Fashion in the Trade Union of Art, Fashion and Advertising, and also runs a movement called Without War, and the Women's Youth Association.

Well supported: Putin, pictured today in Sochi, has been widely criticised by Western countries, but as sanctions are imposed, the Russian population has responded with patriotism

Anastasia Trusova, 25, is the winner of the contest Russian Beauty 2013. Also pictured Irina Volodchenko, 27, creator of the project, and Margarita Bocharova, 22, participants at the Tavrida International Youth Meeting.

However, not all Russian women stand 
behind them, TV presenter Ksenia Sobchak has already sarcastically 
dubbed the women ‘boobed patriots’ in an online post.

Ms
 Sobchak's father Anatoly is the former mayor of St Petersburg and he 
was Putin's political mentor after the Russian president quit the KGB at
 the end of the Soviet era.

Fortunately for these Putin fans there is plainly plenty of space to sunbathe in their patriotic bikins on the beaches of Crimea.

It is estimated the annexed peninsula will have three million fewer tourists this summer as holiday-makers - especially Ukrainians - boycott its resorts.
