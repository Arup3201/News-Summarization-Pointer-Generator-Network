Brussels sprouts weren’t the only thing in short supply on Christmas Eve.

Parking was such a premium at one supermarket, a shopper took the nuclear option and left his car in a trolley bay.

The motorist, known only as Jim, had  joined the late rush to buy some extra supplies of beer at his local Asda in Nuneaton, Warwickshire.

Amazing: This impatient driver was so desperate to get to the supermarket they parked in a trolley bay

But he found himself driving around 
searching in vain for an empty space. Thanks to an impressive piece of  
parking, he squeezed his Peugeot 107 into the trolley bay and went into 
the supermarket.

The customer would normally have been 
fined £75, but the stunt caused such hilarity among staff and shoppers 
that the manager let him off.

Jim said: ‘There was just loads of 
traffic, I thought I would just park it in the bay as there were no 
trollies in it.

‘It’s only a small car so it fitted in fine. I have to admit it was a bit of a struggle to get out of the car.’

'When I got back there was a huge crowd 
looking at my car, the manager of Asda was even there. They said there 
would normally be a £75 fine, but it was so funny they would let it go.

'She said they wanted to frame it in their office. I was only going there to buy some beer.'

An amazed passer-by snapped the parked vehicle and posted it on Twitter, where it immediately went viral.

But he was shocked when he returned with his beer to find a crowd had gathered to marvel at his feat.

Laughs: A selection of comments after the picture spread through Twitter

Simon Freeman, 34, who was at the car park, said he couldn't believe his eyes when he saw the car.
He said: 'It's amazing he even managed to get out of the car, I'm sure he must have had to climb out of the sunroof.

'It was pretty busy in there I must admit, but the rest of us just drove around waiting properly.

'There were certainly some annoyed 
people bringing their trolleys back but I think their anger faded after 
the looked at the achievement for a bit.'

An amazed passer-by snapped the unusually-parked black Peugeot and posted it to Twitter, where it quickly went viral.

Staff and other shoppers are seen staring in utter bafflement at the unusual sight.

Because of the tweet Asda became one of the top trending topics across the UK.

One tweet said: 'Apparently someone really wanted a space.'

Quips on Twitter included: 'Ha ha. They must be off their trolley', 'The best supermarket parking you will see today', 'No parking at Asda - no problem, just park in the trolley bay' and 'The lengths we go 2 for a turkey'.
