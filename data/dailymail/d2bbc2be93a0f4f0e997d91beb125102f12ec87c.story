It doesn’t matter how many steps you record on a fitness tracker, if your posture is poor you could be doing more harm than good.

The Arki wristband has been designed to not only monitor activity levels, but also help wearers improve their stance and walking style.

It uses machine learning technology to analyse a users’ posture, while haptic feedback gives the wearer immediate prompts to stop them slouching or leaning.

Elsewhere, Arki is, a fully functional fitness tracker and has biometric authentication features.

For example, once it has learnt a person’s walking style it knows when a different person is wearing the device.

It can then use the person’s style as a password to get access to the device and its data.

Prices for a basic band start at $99 (£63). 

Arki is dubbed a walking coach and was created by Zikto, which has offices in Los Angeles and Seoul.

Real-time haptic feedback gives the wearer prompts to improve their posture, and all the data is gathered and analysed using a smartphone app which provides a Sound Walking Score. Arki additionally has a Body Balance Analysis tool that identifies physical imbalances

Do you spend hours hunched over your phone? Do you also suffer from neck and back pain?

If so, the two may well be related.

New research has found that slumping to read a text or study a selfie can put undue pressure on the neck, leading to a sore back.

This is because bending the neck increases the pressure put on the spine.

Bending the head at a 60 degree angle to look at a phone screen puts 60 lbs - or 27kg - worth of pressure on the cervical spine, the part of the spine above the shoulders, the study found.

At more than four stone in weight, that is heavier than the average seven year old. 

Its Kickstarter campaign surpassed its initial target of $100,000 (£64,000) just 13 days following its launch earlier this month, and bands are expected to ship internationally in January.

‘Arki takes wearable fitness technology one step further,’ explained the firm.

‘First-generation fitness wearables track the quantity of users’ movement, serving the valuable purpose of getting people moving.

‘Arki, however, tracks not only the quantity but the quality of movement.’

Arki uses machine learning technology to analyse a users’ walking posture to detect poor walking habits and styles.

Real-time haptic feedback gives the wearer prompts to improve their posture, and all the data is gathered and analysed using a smartphone app which provides a Sound Walking Score.

Arki additionally has a Body Balance Analysis tool that identifies physical imbalances, by swapping the wristband from left wrist to right, or vice versa once a week or month.

It then creates a personalised body map.

Arki even suggests personalised exercises, as recommended by professionals, to help users boost their balance.
