Click here to read the most damning allegations in the leaked ECB dossier 

Kevin Pietersen has never been one to follow the norm, and on Tuesday night he chose one of the world’s 100 most endangered buildings to launch the book charting the recent career of this endangered cricketer.

The former England batsman found himself in a stunning Franciscan monastery set, incongruously, in the unfashionable Manchester suburb of Gorton to publicise the autobiography that has lit bonfires around the national team.

This late 19th Century building has long since ceased to be a place purely for religious contemplation - it is now rented out for assorted functions - but it still seemed an appropriate place for him to stop to consider the latest chapter in his colourful life.

By the time Pietersen was introduced, in conversation with journalist Tim Hague, he was being buffeted by the appearance of an ECB dossier, which had mysteriously appeared online to coincide with this book launch.

Tuesday night was the first event of what might, in reality, be the last concerted blast of publicity for the wandering batsman, good or bad. His resurrected profile in the past week saw a late surge in interest, and it was standing room only in the cloisters with The Monastery full to its 400-capacity.

Supplementing their number, and paying for their tickets, were representatives from the ECB, including one of M’learned friends in the governing body’s employ, just to keep an eye on things.

It was not long before Pietersen brought out the heavy roller with reference to the home board.

‘My character has been assassinated for five or six years by the ECB press machine, but I can go to bed at night and sleep easy,’ he said.

This was the first time that he had put himself in the court of public opinion, and he got a warm enough reception from the gathering of cricketing enthusiasts, although it was hardly the One Direction treatment.

After warming up, he lined up Graeme Swann in his sights, addressing the spinner’s decision to leave the Ashes tour after three Tests, something he omits  in the book.

‘Do I think it’s right he jumped ship? No, I think he let the England team down. A lot of the players felt very aggrieved by him jumping ship mid-series.

‘If his elbow was an issue, fine, but I think he could have held on for a couple more weeks.’

Never likely to escape was one of his main targets in the book, wicketkeeper and vice-captain Matt Prior, and laughter broke out when the Big Cheese label was brought up - ‘the Dairylea Triangle who thinks he is Brie’.

A truncated round of applause broke out when he addressed the issue of England players being ‘picked on’. He said: ‘Everyone knew there was a bullying culture in that dressing room. A lot of players have texted me in the past 24 hours saying “Well done”.’

As his answers echoed around this former place of worship with its glorious acoustics (it was deconsecrated in 1989), the audience hung on his words.

Whether people like Pietersen or not, they wanted to hear his every thought, even when credulity was stretched. ‘If there was a podium for egos in the England team, I wouldn’t be on it,’ he insisted.

Sitting 30 yards beneath a giant crucifix hung from the ceiling, persecution for stating his beliefs was a recurring theme.

It had been a long day of broadcast appearances and he sounded tired, and somewhat resigned to his fate with England: ‘I live in hope and I know a lot of people will think I have no chance, maybe rightly so.’

He reiterated his regret about Textgate, of how he added to Andrew Strauss’s stress as England captain, and how he apologised to the skipper’s wife, Ruth.

And another thing he kicks himself for: ‘Watching an IPL match on the television while we (England) were batting - bad move. It sounds funny but it wasn’t.’

It is one thing saying it in a book or on the radio, it is another saying it to a room of 400 people.

The first 40 minutes of last night was serious stuff and somewhat joyless, not unlike much of the book. He seemed relieved to, latterly, get questions purely about his playing experiences.

The mood lightened considerably when it was thrown open to the floor, with the people seemingly well-disposed towards him. A boy, announcing that he was 10 years old, asked what tips he might hand out about batting.

‘If it’s up there, hit it into the car park,’ replied Pietersen.

And for a fleeting moment it seemed like 2005 again, everyone eating out of his hand.
