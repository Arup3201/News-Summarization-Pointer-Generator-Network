A weight-lifting champion and Raoul Moat fan beat his girlfriend 'black and blue' after she chose to spend the day at Ascot instead of with him, a court heard.

After repeatedly hitting the 22-year-old with his fists and allegedly whipping her with a belt, bodybuilder Gareth Davies - who has represented Great Britain in power-lifting - then forced Jamie-Lee Cooksey to clean up the blood left splattered around the apartment they shared in Surrey, a court heard.

Davies, who at one point yanked Miss Cooksey off the floor by her hair, was jailed for two years and four months after admitting assault causing actual bodily harm.

Passing sentence, Judge Peter Moss told the aircraft engineer: 'You are a very big and powerful young man. One can only imagine how terrifying it must have been for Miss Cooksey.'

Guildford Crown Court heard Davies, who had previously compared himself to killer Raoul Moat, was on licence from prison where he had been serving a 25-month sentence for a similar attack on a former girlfriend at the time of the incident.

'That previous incident bears strong similarities to the one currently before this court,' said prosecutor John Upton.

On June 19 last year a row erupted between Davies and Miss Cooksey, who is from Fife in Scotland, at their flat in Redhill, Surrey.

'Miss Cooksey had made plans to go to Ascot with her mum for the races. But the defendant was unhappy about that and accused her of being selfish,' Mr Upton said.

Mr Upton told the court Miss Cooksey 
abandoned her day out after getting a call to tell her that Davies was at the
local railway station and was depressed.

She met him there and they returned to together to their apartment, where Davies turned on his girlfriend, the prosecutor said.

'He picked her up by her hair and proceeded to hit her repeatedly,' said Mr Upton.

'Then he punched her repeatedly with his fists before thrashing her with a belt.'

During the hour-long ordeal, Davies told the petrified victim: 'I don’t want to assault you but you’ve pushed me to it.'

'He then made her clean up the flat because it was covered with her blood,' Mr Upton said.

When
Davies, from Chertsey, had calmed down, Miss Cooksey sent a
text to her mother which read: 'Call the police or I’m not going to survive.'

She eventually managed to flee the apartment and take refuge at a local newsagents, the court heard.

The court heard Davies had been jailed in April 2011 for two offences of assault causing actual bodily harm and three of assault with intent to resist arrest after throttling his one-time partner Lucy Barrett, then 24, and going on a rampage at the Holiday Inn in Shepperton during a fit of rage.

On that occasion Miss Barrett, speaking from behind a witness screen, told the court how Davies, had often spoken about Moat and compared his own situation with his.

She said: 'He told me everyone had got it wrong about Raoul Moat, he didn’t go mad because of the steroids - he went mad because he had a diddy girlfriend and no one listened to him.'

'He said that he would go on a killing rampage because his family didn’t listen to him, or support him,' she added.

Davies initially denied responsibility for the attack on Miss Cooksey, and said she took cocaine, was 'bi-polar', and that her injuries had been the result of her doing cartwheels while wearing high-heeled shoes.

James Mason, defending, told the court his client now accepted inflicting the injuries, but denied the use of a belt.

He said Davies had problems with his pituitary gland and was taking 11 different forms of medication.

In a victim impact statement, Miss Cooksey said she had been left 'traumatised' by her ordeal.

Jailing Davies, who was once sent to prison for armed robbery, Judge Moss said the assault and the defendant’s comments bore all the classic hallmarks of serious domestic violence.

'She was black and blue on her arms,' he said.

Judge Moss added: 'This is a bad case. Miss Cooksey said she was going off for a day at the races. It was the trigger for you to abuse her.'
