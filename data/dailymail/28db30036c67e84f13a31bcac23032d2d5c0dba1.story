Manchester United have banned supporters from bringing iPads and tablet devices into Old Trafford this season.

There has been a growing trend in the digital age for supporters to use iPads to capture the action, sometimes blocking the view for supporters sitting behind.

There have also been private fears in some quarters that supporters may record large portions of the match with the devices.

Silver lining: Luckily United fans will still be able to use their handheld mobiles inside the ground

Ahead of Louis van Gaal's first match at Old Trafford as Manchester United manager against Valencia on Tuesday evening, supporters attending the game received an email providing information over pre-match entertainment and also detailing an update on safety procedure.

The email reads: 'We want to make you aware of an update to our club policy regarding home matches. Supporters cannot bring large electronic devices (bigger than 150mmx100mm) inside the stadium.

'For example, iPads or other tablet devices and laptops are now prohibited. Also please be aware that large bags, large cameras and liquids (with the exception of a small bottle of water with the top removed) are included in our list of prohibited items. Thank you for your co-operation on this matter.'

In 2010, the New York Yankees banned iPads from their stadium but they reversed the decision two years later.

Items banned at Old Trafford: Alcohol, canned drinks, dark plastic bottles, drink cartons, drinking glasses, glass bottles, flasks, water in excess of 500ml, with the top removed, baby buggies or prams, camcorders, darts, fireworks, flares, knives, weapons, large bags or suitcases, umbrellas, flags or banners greater than 2m x 1m or of an offensive nature, poles or sticks, radios, smoke or gas canisters, telescopic or long lens cameras, tools.

What can you bring into the stadium? Small lens camera (3 inch zoom or less), non offensive flags or banners 2m x 1m or less, small fold up umbrellas, small bags/backpacks, clear plastic bottles of water 500ml or less without the top.
