Ivan Rakitic wants FIFA’s ban on Luis Suarez to be overturned so the Uruguayan can begin training at Barcelona as soon as possible.

And the Croatian international, signed this summer from Sevilla, believes once the former Liverpool striker takes the field alongside Neymar and Lionel Messi, the best three players in the world will be united in the same team – surpassing Real Madrid rival Cristiano Ronaldo.

Suarez is due to make his return from a four-month suspension for biting Italy’s Giorgio Chiellini against Real at the Bernabeu on October 26. His ban from ‘any football-related activities’ ends the day before.

But he and Barcelona have taken an appeal to the Court of Arbitration for Sport and even though no hearing dates have been set a statement released by CAS last week said: ‘It is likely that a final award will be rendered well before the end of August.’

Rakitic, speaking during Barcelona’s stay at St George’s Park in Burton, expects the ban on Suarez - who has moved to the Pyrenees to train - to be quashed.

‘I think he is one of the best players in the world, so of course I would like if he could stay tomorrow or today with us,’ said Rakitic. ‘I am expecting he can start soon with us, and I hope he will bring to us the same as he did Liverpool.’ 

Messi and Neymar are also absent from the training camp at the FA’s National Football Centre because of World Cup exertions. Rakitic believes when the Argentine and Brazilian are back Barca will have the top three players on the planet.

Day in the sun: Suarez is available to play from the end of October following his lengthy ban

He said: ‘I think that these three players are maybe the best players in the world, the others (at Barcelona) I think have to be with them. From the three players we can learn so much. We have to do our best.

‘But I think the team is not only these three players. Every player has to work in his position, so if these three players are better, we will also be better. We have to work together to be a strong team, a hard team. We hope they will be with us next week and start work together.’

Rakitic understands trophies must now follow for Luis Enrique’s team.

‘It doesn’t matter if you change a lot of players or not, this club deserves to win games and titles and that is what we are here for and what we are working for.’
