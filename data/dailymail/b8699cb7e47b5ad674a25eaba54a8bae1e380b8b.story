An infamous house of horrors where one of Britain's most brutal torture killings took place has now been sold for £250,000 as a 'delightful' development opportunity.

Burnt House Farm in Tabley, near Knutsford, Cheshire was described by estate agents as having an 'excellent range of outbuildings providing tremendous potential standing' when it was put on the market this year.

However, the details did not mention the horrific murder at the farmhouse ten years ago, in which a drugs gang tortured a man to death in front of his family.

Crime scene for sale: Burnt House Farm was finally sold for just £250,000 because of the infamous murder of Brian Waters at the house

Makeshift torture chamber: Waters, who rented the farm, died a slow and agonising death at the property in 2003 before being dumped in the milking parlour

Drug money: Waters grew cannabis plants at the farm, pictured, but was also involved in narcotics trafficking and said to owe one of his torturers £20,000

In June 2003 market trader Brian Waters, 44, who was renting the farm, suffered up to 167 different injuries to every part of his head and body, including 24 individual rib fractures when he was killed in the cowshed.

Waters was beaten, whipped, burned, attacked with a staple gun and hung upside down before being assaulted with an iron bar, which fatally damaged his internal organs.

Victim: Waters suffered around 167 different injuries as part of the gang's systematic torture

After the systematic torture his body was dumped in a milking parlour.

At the Chester Crown Court trial, the
jury heard how Waters, a former chemists’ worker, had rented Burnt House Farm since 2002 and used it to grow cannabis.

But he was also involved in narcotics trafficking with one of his killers drug dealer John Wilson and was said to have owed him £20,000.

The murder of Waters was planned to exact revenge on him for the debt and took place in what was described as a 'makeshift torture chamber.'

The
killers initially broke into the farmhouse and destroyed the cannabis 
farm, then attacked the stepson of Waters’ business partner.

He
was battered senseless dragged into the barn, where he was tied up by his 
ankles with his face submerged beneath water in a 
barrel.

He was burned with chemicals and a pillowcase covering his head was set on fire as the gang laughed at his distress.

Waters then arrived at the farm and was suspended upside down and used as a 'human punchbag.'

When Waters’ son Gavin and a woman arrived at the farm they were abducted at gunpoint.

In prison: Drug baron John Wilson, left, was the mastermind behind the murder over the unpaid debt, aided by James Raven, right, who had previously worked undercover for the BBC and Channel 4

Gavin was put in a position with a rope round his neck so if he moved beyond a certain limit he would choke to death.

The 21-year old woman was tied up and had her breasts fondled.

Brian Waters’ wife Julie was also abducted from the family home and 
taken to the scene of the murder.

She arrived to discover that her husband had been murdered.

In 2004 undercover BBC reporter James
Raven, then 44, and drug baron John Wilson, then 54, were found guilty 
of murder and jailed for life with a 
recommendation they serve 24 years.

Raven had worked on the BBC's MacIntyre Uncovered and Crooked Britain, as well as Channel 4's Sleepers.

At large: Christopher More, pictured left and right, has never been caught and is believed to be in Spain

Then
in 2007 car wash boss Otis Matthews, then 29, was also convicted of 
murder and jailed for 22 years.

A fourth man Chris More, now 34, is 
still wanted for murder and is believed to be on the run in Spain.

After
the killing it is believed the four-bedroom farm had been empty before being put up for auction.

It failed to sell and was put on the market by estate agents Mellor Braggins and it attracted a string of viewings.

The
details said: 'A detached farmhouse requiring modernisation with an 
excellent range of outbuildings providing tremendous potential standing 
within grounds of just over an acre situated in a convenient location 
with delightful views over adjoining countryside.'

Moving on: The house and outbuildings have now been sold as a 'delightful' development opportunity, despite their horrific past

Aftermath: Burnt Farm House in 2003 when the police arrived to investigate

Today the estate agents said all prospective buyers had been informed of the murder before being shown around the property.

A
source said: 'There was quite a lot of interest - not because of the 
history but because it is a property with outbuildings.

The bottom line 
is it is a good development opportunity and it sold for around the guide
price of £250,000.'
