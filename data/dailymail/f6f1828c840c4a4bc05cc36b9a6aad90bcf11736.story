David Cameron has pledged to seek ‘fresh consent from the British people’ on Europe – if he wins the next election.

Speaking in a round of TV interviews in Rio de Janeiro, the Prime Minister said the fallout from the euro crisis would create 'opportunities for a new settlement between Britain and Europe'.

He said he would give details of his new pledge later this autumn. But Tory MPs last night called for 'action, not words' and said any referendum must include an option to leave the EU if the Prime Minister was to restore his battered credibility on the issue.

It came on the da Mr Cameron visited one of Brazil's toughest neighbourhoods, Mare Favela, just north of Rio De Janeiro, which is so dangerous it is not policed.

In a further ramping up of the rhetoric on Europe Mr Cameron also confirmed for the first time that Britain will opt-out of a package of more than 100 EU justice and policing powers later this year - before deciding which ones to opt back in to. The decision sets up a bruising row with Nick Clegg over whether Britain should remain under the jurisdiction of the controversial EU arrest warrant.

Mr Cameron has come under intense pressure from his own party to toughen his stance on Europe, amid signs that the euro crisis is accelerating the drive to create a federal Europe.European Commission president Jose Manuel Barroso announced this month that he wants to turn the EU into a 'federation of nation states' by 2014.

Yesterday Mr Cameron indicated that a new EU treaty would spark a referendum in the UK. But he suggested the poll would come after the 2015 election. And he again stressed his own view that Britain should stay in the EU - suggesting that any referendum may not include an option for Britain to leave.

Speaking from Brazil, where he has been leading a trade mission, he said: 'I don't think it is in Britain's interests to leave the EU, but I do think what it is increasingly becoming the time for is a new settlement between Britain and Europe and I think that new settlement will require fresh consent.

'In the next Parliament, I think there will be opportunities for a fresh settlement and for new consent to that settlement.

'There is a reason why. The euro is a currency with 17 different countries. I think increasingly, one currency will mean one economic policy. They are going to change and that will give us opportunities for changing our relationship with Europe.

'I argue for Britain's membership because I want to be able to say to countries like Brazil "Come to Britain and you can sell to the 320 million consumers across Europe".

'I argue for Britain's membership because I think it is in our interests. If I didn't think it was in our interests, I wouldn't argue for British membership.'

Eurosceptic MP Douglas Carswell said the Prime Minister had 'lost credibility' on the issue in the eyes of many voters. And he said it was critical that any referendum contained an option for people to leave the EU.

Mr Carswell said: 'It is all very well for the Prime Minister to talk about what he may or may not do after the next election but unless we get on and give people a vote in an in/out referendum we will see many more Conservative voters desert us before the next election.

'It would be entirely bogus if he offers the British people a referendum that doesn't include an option to leave the EU.

'The Prime Minister has broken one cast-iron pledge on this and lacks credibility as a result. We need action now, not words.' Fellow Tory John Baron described Mr Cameron's comments as a 'step forward' but said it was disappointing that the Prime Minister was resisting calls to legislate now for a referendum after 2015.

'There are many upsides in committing to a referendum now – not least it would address the very real lack of public trust when people hear politicians making promises about the EU.' Mr Cameron confirmed that Britain will use an opt-out to pull out of a package of more than 100 EU policing and justice powers. but ministers will then seek to opt back into some felt to be in Britain's interests.

He said:We’ll be exercising that opt-out.  They key thing then is, well, which of the array of things you’ve come out of do you actually think are good for Britain and you want to cooperate with European partners on?  And that’s a discussion we’re having at the moment.'

The Lib Dems are pressing to keep Britain in the EU arrest warrant despite concerns it has led to the wrongful arrest of many British citizens.
