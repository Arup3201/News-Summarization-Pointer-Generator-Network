Britons are abandoning traditional barbecue fare in favour of more upmarket foods including marinated meat, exotic salads and stuffed vegetables, a study has revealed.

Many are ditching plain sausages and burgers in favour of grilled fish, succulent steaks and homemade coleslaw, according to research.

In an effort to impress their guests, 22 per cent of Britons cook more unusual meats such as venison or duck to liven up their outdoor feast, while a third will only buy good cuts of herbed or marinated meat.

Out with the old: Brits are bored with traditional barbeque fare

Another 21 per cent depend on exotic 
foods and home-made salads and 34 per cent focus on presentation in an 
effort to wow their guests.

And, 61 per cent of Britons use marinades, some even making their own, to make their food stand out.

A spokesman for Kikkoman, which 
produces soy sauce and carried out the study, said: ‘There was a time 
when barbecues would consist of a burnt sausage in a roll, a plain 
burger with processed cheese slices and a bit of salad on the side.

‘But it seems people are being more 
creative when it comes to their outdoor feasts and the traditional food 
no longer makes the grade.

‘Rather than simply slapping a few 
burgers on the coals, hosting a barbecue now means taking your time in 
the kitchen to make sure you produce the tastiest food possible.

‘Hosts are now going the extra mile to
 make sure their guests enjoy their food by making burgers and salads 
from scratch instead of buying them ready-made, and marinating fresh 
meat for hours beforehand.’

The study, of 1,000 Britons, found that 
58 per cent said they were tired of eating the same barbecue food all 
the time and that nine in ten enjoyed having something different.

Half of those surveyed also said they 
be disappointed if they went to a barbecue with only hotdogs and burgers
 and one in five said they would refuse to go if they knew only plain 
food would be on offer.

Almost a third even admitted to 
competing with friends and relatives to see who could serve up the best 
and most varied selection of dishes at a barbecue with 52 per cent 
saying celebrity cooking shows and books have inspired them to be more 
adventurous.

The study also revealed that some of the most popular ‘posh nosh’ served at a barbecue include marinated meats, potato salad, prawn skewers, and homemade burgers and coleslaw.
