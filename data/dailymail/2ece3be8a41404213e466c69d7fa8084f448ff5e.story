Donald Sterling's worst punishment may be one he's secretly battling.

Sources tell the New York Post that the racist Clippers owner is currently fighting cancer and was expected to die two years ago.

'People have been predicting his imminent demise,' one source, who works with professional sports teams, said. 'I'm sure he has the best..drugs money can buy.  He can do anything to keep himself alive.'

The source adds that the drugs he has been taking are responsible for making his face look puffy.

Another source said he was diagnosed with prostate cancer specifically - the same disease former Clippers assistant coach Kim Hughes fought a decade ago.

At the time, Sterling refused to pay for Hughes' surgery and four players ended up scraping together the $70,000.

Sterling made headlines over the weekend when audio recordings of him were released, telling his mistress V. Stiviano not to bring black people to games or post pictures with them on Instagram.

Zero tolerance: NBA Commissioner Adam Silver also asked the Board of Governors to vote Sterling to sell his team

On Tuesday, NBA Commissioner Adam Silver banned Sterling for life and advised the Board of Governors to force him to sell his team.

The cancer revelations come the same day that images were released of Sterling in his underwear by another of his former mistresses.

Ex-girlfriend Alexandra Castro shared the skimpy photos of Sterling lounging in his tidy-whities in bed and on the couch with Inside Edition.

Intimate portraits: Sterling went on to call Castro a hooker in a 2003 lawsuit

Sterling later called her a hooker in a 2003 lawsuit when he was trying to get properties from her back. The images were used as evidence of their intimate relationship.

Sterling doesn't seem to be a big fan of clothes, former family friends revealed to MailOnline Thursday.

Phillip Scheid and sister Cheryl Bogart grew up with Sterling's son Scott, who died of a drug overdose last year at the age of 31.

Phillip was present at the home on several occasions when Sterling would beat Scott with a belt, often when he was completely naked.

'He did everything naked,' Phillip said.

‘The cook would make the same meal every single day for Don – lamb chop, salad, noodles. It was always served in the same bowl and he’d always be naked. She would keep serving it and he’d be naked in the kitchen sitting in the chair while watching TV.’

They say it was no secret that Sterling was a racist and that he once told Scott to 'stop being a little n***** and use the cutlery' when he grabbed food with his hands at the dinner table.

'I’m not a racist and to hear those words shocked me, I was brought up to think everyone was equal,' Scheid said.

Cheryl also admits being preyed on by Sterling when she was just a teen.

‘We’d go to their Malibu home and there were so many crazy things said by Donald, it used to wash over you. But I’ll never forget that at the age of 15, with no one else around, he told me that I could go in the pool without my bikini on if I wanted to. I was repulsed.’

Insiders at ABC told the Post that Sterling is currently in negotiations to sit down for an interview with Barbara Walters.

Since the news broke over the weekend of his racist statements, Sterling has allegedly been holing up at a penthouse away from his Malibu mansion for fear of being recorded.

But he hasn't sworn off public life completely.

On Wednesday he was spotted dining out at LA eatery The Grill on the Alley where billionaire David Geffen is a regular.

Geffen is one of many people, including Oprah Winfrey and Magic Johnson, who have expressed interest in buying the Clippers.

'Mr. Sterling is a longtime customer of The Grill, and we do not discriminate against any of our guests, a Grill spokeswoman told the New York Daily News on Thursday.

Other establishments have not taken as kindly to Sterling's scandal.

On Wednesday, the Bunny Ranch brothel in Nevada followed the NBA's suit and banned Sterling.

'A lot of NBA players come here to party,' owner Dennis Hof told The Huffington Post. 'Out of respect to them, we have banned Sterling from coming here.'
