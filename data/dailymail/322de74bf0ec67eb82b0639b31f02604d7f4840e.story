The mother charged with poisoning her  son to death with a massive dose of salt is now telling investigators the 5-year-old may be to blame and she had nothing to do with it.

Lacey Spears, 26, told Westchester County authorities the boy 'would once in a while play with his feeding tube and could have put something in it.'

Documents filed Friday reveal that police now believe Spears not only poisoned her son's feeding tube with salt, but did so over the course of several days, reports the Westchester Journal News. 

Sick: The youngster (pictured in hospital with his mother, Lacey Spears, just days before his death), was diagnosed with hypernatremia - a condition that sees high salt levels in the blood - prior to his first birthday

Police also appear to believe, according to these newly filed documents, that Spears poisoned her son while he was being treated at Valhalla Medical Center.

Police who interview Spears just before her son died said she 'looked visibly distraught but showed no sign of tears.'

I was previously revealed that Garnett was treated for high levels of sodium as a baby, but no seemed to point the finger at Spears.

Garnett Spears, from Chestnut Ridge, New York, was diagnosed with hypernatremia - a condition that sees elevated salt levels in the blood - prior to his first birthday, according to an official  report.

But despite his condition, staff at an Alabama hospital apparently failed to report it as possible abuse to the authorities.

Garnett died on January 23 this year in Westchester Medical Center in Valhalla after his sodium levels rose to an extremely dangerous level with no medical explanation.

His mother Lacey Spears, 26, who documented her son's persistent illnesses online, has been charged with killing him by administering salt through a feeding tube in his stomach.

The newly-released fatality report, obtained from New York State officials by The Journal News, reveals that staff expressed concern for Spears's 'emotional stability' when Garnett was a baby.

The mother, who is nicknamed the 'mommy blogger', was believed to suffer from Postpartum Depression and Manchausen Syndrome by Proxy.

The condition is a psychiatric disorder which makes a parent purposely hurt their child for attention.

When Garnett was only five weeks old, Spears 'verbalized she wanted to harm him', the report said.

Around a month later, she was referred to medical social services for 'interpersonal conflict, stress and dysfunction'. The document does not state what the outcome of the referral was. 

Barry Spear, a spokesman for the Alabama Department of Human Resources, said he had no record of hypernatremia being reported to the authorities when Garnett was a baby.

Charged: Spears, who shared her son's hospital room, documented his persistent illness in detail online

Spears, who shared her son's hospital room after he was brought in suffering from vomiting and seizures, pleaded not guilty in June to charges of depraved murder and first-degree manslaughter.

Depraved murder is a count often used in cases that suggest extreme recklessness rather than intentional killing.

It carries the same maximum sentence, however - 25 years to life.

Spears, who fled to Kentucky following Garnett's death, is being held without bail at Westchester County jail, where she has been placed on suicide watch.

Findings: When Garnett was only five weeks old, Spears 'verbalized she wanted to harm him', the report said

Earlier this month, her lawyers filed motions seeking to have her previous medical records, including her suspected Manchasuen, removed from the trial.

The judge is expected to rule on those motions at the next hearing on October 15.

Munchausen by Proxy, is a psychiatric disorder which makes a parent purposely hurt their child - to get attention.

'It is so counter-intuitive to all our ideas of what parenthood is supposed to be,' said Dr. Marc D. Feldman who has written extensively about Munchausen syndrome.

'But medical child abuse can and does occur.'

Feldmen told USA Today that this case has at least four distinct red-flags for him that indicate the possibility of abuse.

1) Garnett had a feeding tube for unknown reasons. In case of Munchausen by proxy the child will be sick enough to have a feeding tube or intravenous line that gives the abuser access to the body internally.'That's an avenue for medical chaos,' Feldman said. 'A feeding tube is a real red flag.'

2) It is almost physically impossible to ingest or force feed a lethal does of salt. However, introducing it over time through a feeding tube is possible.

3) Feldman points out that those with Munchausen often exhibit pseudologia fantastica — compulsive lying - Spears told lies about her partner and about being a mother

4) Exaggerated stories of their child being ill is another symptom - and in this case Spears obsessively detailed her child's illnesses onlinePeople with the condition also have borderline personality disorder, a psychiatric condition marked by problems with impulsive and reckless behavior, leading to unstable relationships.
