Australian jihadists don't want to come home from Syria - they just want to win or die in a bloody fight for apparent religious glory.

That's according to a purported British jihadist in Syria fighting for Jahbut al-Nusra (JN), which is considered a terrorist organisation under Australian law.

'No1 wants to return, here it is victory or shahada (martyrdom) all way,' said apparent militant Abu Basir Jabh Nusra in an online exchange about Australians with former terror suspect Zaky Mallah.

The foreign fighter described 'ozzies' who had joined the fight as 'wonderful brothers' and praised their 'cracking accent'.

He has shared pictures of himself and others in military fatigues and in his online accounts has said he previously lived in the United Kingdom. 

The exchange came about as Abu Basir was questioned by Mallah about his interactions with Australian fighters. 

Mallah was the first Australian charged under terrorism offences in 2003 but he was acquitted following two years in maximum security prison. 

'I've been in this jihadi world for the past 15 years. I know a real jihadi from a fake jihadi,' said Mallah, who supports JN because it fights Syrian dictator Bashar al-Assad.

Prime Minister Tony Abbott announced a series of counter-terrorism measures, including stripping some Australian foreign fighters of their citizenship, on Monday.

'We will ensure returning foreign fighters are prosecuted or closely monitored using strengthened control orders,' Mr Abbott said.

The government is concerned that returning fighters would use their military experience overseas in terrorist actions on home soil. 

Recent government figures say 110 Australian fighters have joined Islamic State. 

Terrorism expert Professor Greg Barton told Daily Mail Australia the number of Australians who have fought for Jabhut al-Nusra is unclear. 

Many have changed allegiances from al-Nusra to rival organisation IS, he said, including killed Australian militant Mohammad Ali Baryalei.
