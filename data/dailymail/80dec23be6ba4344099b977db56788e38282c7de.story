Plucky amputee Ciaran Fenton knew it would be risky when he confronted a gang of Eastern European yobs vandalising a park bench.

But he couldn't have expected the savagery with which his good intentions were met.

One of the group, towering and bald, turned on the brave teenager and reigned blow after blow onto his face.

It hadn't been long since Ciaran, 18, had undergone his latest chemotherapy session at London's University College Hospital, where he is being treated for cancer.

The brave youngster has had to have a hand amputated in a life-saving operation to remove a deadly tumour.

Defenceless Ciaran, of Hatfield, Herts, sustained a 'fat lip and a black eye' in the savage attack just after 10pm last Thursday.

His outraged mum Helen said: 'Ciaran was walking home from Breaks Manor with some friends and there were some Polish guys jumping on the bench outside the library.

'They told them it was going to break.'

Mrs Fenton said one of the cowardly gang then launched a vicious assault on Ciaran and 'punched the living daylights out of him'.

'Ciaran has one hand and one of them lobbed his shoe after it came off,' she said.

'That is just so malicious, I'm still so angry about it.'

Shell-shocked Ciaran said: 'They completely battered me. They started on someone with one hand. How could they do that?'

He added: 'They were damaging the property outside the library as well.'

A Hertfordshire Police spokesman said the brutes ran off in the direction of Market Place after beating up Ciaran.

She said the thug was about 6ft tall, bald and spoke with an Eastern European accent.

'He was wearing a black Adidas hoodie, dark burgundy jeans and was aged between 30 and 35,' she said.
