Towering battlements, a pair of knights jousting on horseback and a terrifying dragon took centre stage as a magical kingdom made entirely from ice was unveiled as the centrepiece of Hyde Park's new Winter Wonderland.

The event has become an annual fixture in the London events calendar, and the kingdom has already had a visit from a real royal, after Princess Beatrice became one of the first through its doors last night.

Winter Wonderland, which opens to the public today, also boasts an ice slide, a huge ice rink, an ice bar and a colourful Christmas market that boasts stallholders drawn from all over Europe.

Opening to the public tomorrow at 5pm, the Magical Ice Kingdom is one of the most popular attractions of Hyde Park's Winter Wonderland 

Some of the smaller pieces that make up the vast kingdom will have been started being carved as early as July 

Over a hundred intricate ice sculptures have been painstakingly carved by over 50 artists from around the world for the exhibition 

The exhibition is sure to be a hit with children such as Isabella Hope and Ida Bergsmed (pictured), who are able to sit on ice thrones 

Illuminated by dramatic floor lighting, translucent dragons, castles, woodland creatures and even beer barrels are on display 

Spectacular though they are, it is the awe-inspiring Magical Kingdom that looks set to be the highlight of this year's event - thanks in no small part to the 100 individual ice sculptures.

50 ice artists took two week to create the kingdom, carving most of the scenes on site in the specially created dome, which is kept at a chilly minus 10 degrees.

Though the majority of the sculptures were created in Hyde Park, the enormity of the exhibition meant that some of the smaller pieces were begun as early as July in the various sculptors' studios.

The biggest ice exhibition in the world, completing the Magical Ice Kingdom required an astonishing 250 tonnes of snow and 100 tonnes of ice - all of which had to be specially shipped to London.

In total the Magical Ice Kingdom has taken 250 tonnes of snow and 100 tonnes of ice to create
