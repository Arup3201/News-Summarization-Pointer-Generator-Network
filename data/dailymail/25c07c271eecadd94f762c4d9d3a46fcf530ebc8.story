Workers who retire this year will be an average of £3,000 a year worse off than their friends, family and colleagues who retired at the start of the financial crisis, a report reveals today.

The so-called ‘Class of 2014’ - those who plan to retire over the next 12 months - typically expect to receive £15,800 a year.

But this is £2,900 less a year, equal to £8 a day, than people who retired in 2008, the year that the recession began but before it had wreaked havoc on people’s retirement plans.

Crucially, the ‘Class of 2008’ retired before the Bank of England decided to cut the base rate to an historic low of 0.5 per cent, the lowest level in its 320-year history.

Yesterday - for the 58th consecutive month - the Bank’s interest rate setting committee voted to keep the base rate frozen at this level.

The decision was made in March 2009 in a move which has crippled people’s savings with interest rates paid by banks and building societies on their nest eggs close to zero.

It is the longest period during which the Bank has decided not to raise interest rates since the aftermath of the Second World War when it was stuck at 2 per cent for 12 years.

To make matters worse, the true impact on people retiring today is even worse if the figures are adjusted to take into account the crippling increase in the cost of living.

Since 2008, prices have risen by nearly 20 per cent, according to the report from the insurance giant, Prudential.

While the ‘Class of 2008’ retired with an average income of £18,700 a year, a person retiring this year would need an annual income of £22,400 to have the same spending power.

Vince Smith-Hughes, a retirement expert from the Prudential, said: ‘Inflation is eroding pensioners’ spending power in real terms.’

For millions of pensioners, the main problem is that they might have saved as much money in their pension pot - but get much less money when they use it to buy an annuity, an income for life.

In January 2008, a 65-year-old man cashing in his £100,000 pension pot would have received an annual income for life of £7,341.

Today a man with the same pot of money would get only £6,099 a year, a drop of 17 per cent, according to the financial advisers Hargreaves Lansdown.

Simon Rose, from the campaign group Save our Savers, said: ‘Throughout the crisis, the Bank has shown utter contempt for the effect of their policies on savers and pensioners.

‘What they view as economic theory is lifetime hardship for many people at the most difficult time of their life.’

The report, based on interviews with 7,821 people aged 45 and over, including 1,010 who plan to retire this year, asked people how much they expect to receive every year when they retire.

Income from their State pension, any other pension, such as a company pension, and their savings were included.

Other types of income, such as money from a buy-to-let property or earnings from a part-time job, were excluded.

The report reveals significant regional differences, with the best-off pensioners in London getting £18,400 a year compared to the worst-off in the North East on only £13,900 a year.
