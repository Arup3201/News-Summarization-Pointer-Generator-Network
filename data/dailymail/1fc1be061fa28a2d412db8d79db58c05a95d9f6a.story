The Trekker camera in action: 'You¿ve seen our cars, trikes, snowmobiles and trolleys¿but wheels only get you so far. There¿s a whole wilderness out there that is only accessible by foot.

Google's camera-armed Street View cars have caused controversy wherever they've driven - but now the search giant is to 'go offroad'.

Google's new Street Trekker backpack cameras will allow the search giant to explore back yards, footpaths and even the wilderness.

Describing the previous Google Maps as 'not much of a map', the Californian company unveiled a new technology that fits the previously car-mounted cameras inside a bacpack.

The company has already tested the cameras 'in the wild' - but it's unclear as to how much of the world Google plans to explore.

'Today, we’re taking another step forward with our Street View Trekker,' said the company this week.

'You’ve seen our cars, trikes, snowmobiles and trolleys—but wheels only 
get you so far. There’s a whole wilderness out there that is only 
accessible by foot.

'Trekker solves that problem by enabling us to 
photograph beautiful places such as the Grand Canyon so anyone can 
explore them. All the equipment fits in this one backpack, and we’ve 
already taken it out on the slopes.'

Google Street View is banned in countries such as Germany over privacy concerns.

Google also announced a complete overhaul to the imagery on Google Maps.

The
search giant has sent a convoy of planes over major cities in the 
world, each plane capturing advanced 3D information and detailed 
photographs.

The result 
will be a complete 3D experience of major cities across the world, 
allowing users to swoop and fly through replicas which are exact - with 
even trees getting the 3D treatment.

'It’s a pretty limited search engine that only draws from a subset of 
sources,' said Google via its official mapping blog, referring to the current state of Street View.

'In the same way, it’s not much of a map that leaves you 
stranded the moment you step off the highway or visit a new country. 
Over the last few years we’ve been building a comprehensive base map of 
the entire globe—based on public and commercial data, imagery from every
level (satellite, aerial and street level) and the collective knowledge
of our millions of users.'

Google showed a demonstration of a 3-D map of San Francisco, in which a user can navigate around an aerial view of the city

Today's Google Earth announcement revealed Google now has camera planes which have taken images like this of San Francisco

It
is the next step of Google's controversial plan to create a photo-based
map of the world - and it will begin rolling out before the end of the 
year.

Google is also 
planning to introduce offline support to Google Maps, in a bid to offset
the expected loss of traffic from iPhone and iPad users, with Apple set
to launch their own competitor to Maps.

Both The Wall Street Journal and a 
technology blog called 9to5 have reported that Apple next week will 
make a move to drop Google 
Maps, which currently comes pre-loaded on all iPhone and iPad products.
