Those who like to walk on the Wild West side will no doubt be intrigued to learn that one of Buffalo Bill’s favorite guns is going up for auction, almost 100 years after his death.

The legendary showman - real name William Cody - bought the six-shooter revolver in 1883, the same year he launched his circus-style travelling show, which famously featured Sioux Indian Sitting Bull.

He was one of the most iconic characters from the American Old West era and was a contemporary of Calamity Jane and Wild Bill Hickok.

Auction that's bound to trigger interest: One of Buffalo Bill's favorite guns with which he used to wow crowds in his famous Wild West show is up for sale

Although unremarkable to look at, the gun became one of Cody's favourite firearms and was among the few he still owned at the time of his death aged 70 in 1917 from kidney failure.

Cody, who earned his nickname hunting buffalo as a young man, was known for his generosity and although he owned many guns during his successful career he gave most of them away.

He bought the gun at Hartley and Graham in New York while on extended stay with his theatre troupe.

Historic: The gun, a Colt Frontier Six Shooter Revolver, was passed down through the family of Cody (right) until it was sold at auction in 1988 to the current vendor, a collector from the US

High worth: The pistol is being auctioned with a starting price of $37,500

Lock what else is for sale: The key to the City of Manchester presented to Buffalo Bill

He used it as a prop in the popular show, which featured displays of skill, reinactments of battles and themed sideshows, up until it came to a close in 1906.

It is being auctioned with starting price of $37,500 - around £22,000 - at Heritage Auctions.

A pistol belonging to Cody when he was a scout for the US Army during the American Indian Wars sold for $240,000 (£143,000) in 2012.

Partnership: Buffalo Bill with Sitting Bull, who featured in his show for a short while

The key to Manchester which was presented to Cody in 1887 following a five-month stay in the city while on tour is also up for sale.

Cody had taken his Wild West show to England that year to celebrate the Jubilee year of Queen Victoria, also performing in London and Birmingham.

One side of the key is engraved ‘Presented to Buffalo Bill Cody 1887’ while the other side reads ‘From the city of Manchester England’. Bidding starts at $3,200 (£1,900).

Tom Slater, head of Americana at Heritage Auctions, said: ‘Buffalo Bill had dozens of guns over the years but he was a very generous man and gave a lot of them away.

‘He only held on to a handful of his most prized guns and this was one of them.

‘Buffalo Bill used this gun during his famous Wild West show which travelled all over the US and even to continental Europe.

‘He was one of the most famous characters of the American Old West era and so the sale of this gun is hugely significant.

‘Barely a handful of his unembellished handguns are known in public or private collections.

‘He chose to keep hold of the gun as it was one of his favorites and it remained in his family for a long time so the provenance is exceptional.

‘The fact that it is being sold alongside other Cody memorabilia such as the key to the city of Manchester makes it a very special sale.’

The auction will take place in Dallas, Texas, on June 14.
