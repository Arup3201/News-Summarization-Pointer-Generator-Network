A school sent 20 youngsters home because they turned up for lessons with their hair dyed bright red for Comic Relief.

Stacey Clay, 32, was told to take her two children home and wash their hair before they would be allowed into lessons at the Henry Whipple School in Nottingham.

Thomas, seven, and Molly, six, were among around 20 pupils who had temporarily coloured their locks, after being invited to wear red as part of a non-uniform day.

But when the excited youngsters arrived at the school gates they were turned away by staff who said the hair dye broke the rules.

 'All the parents were saying it was ridiculous,' she said Ms Clay, 32. 

'It was meant to be a day for charity.

The sibling's mother branded the decision by the school 'ridiculous'

'A letter got sent out last week saying it was non-uniform day, wear something red - but it didn't say 'don't have red hair'.

'It was the school's fault for not noting on the letter that they would not have allowed red hair.'

Keighley Britten, 28, also had to fetch her two children, Lan-i Comrie, four, and Kyeiss Comrie, five, after spraying their hair red.

 'I felt I had to take them to wash their hair. The kids wanted to go back,' she said.

But the school have stood by the decision claiming they were protecting pupils with allegies.  

Headteacher Cari Burgess said: 'Since I have been headteacher we have not allowed children to come in coloured hair spray, to protect their clothing, school resources and any children with potential allergies.

'A very small number of children still chose to come to school with red hair.

'However, following an explanation these parents - with the exception of one - chose to support the school and take their children home to wash their hair.' 

The school caters for 230 pupils aged 3-11 and was rated 'Good' in its latest Ofsted inspection in 2013.
