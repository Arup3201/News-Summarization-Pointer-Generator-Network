Shocking: Some elderly people are bombarded with as many as 10 nuisance calls a day

Some elderly people are bombarded with as many as 10 nuisance calls a day after being targeted by ruthless sales companies, a survey found yesterday.

It said that frail older people get 60 per cent more sales calls than the average.

The selection of vulnerable people for high pressure sales cold calling can involve ‘sucker lists’ which contain names and details of elderly people considered likely to be easily persuaded to buy over the phone. 

Lists can be compiled by marketing companies, sometimes using doubtful methods such as listing people who respond to fake adverts for products like hearing aids.

The scale of targeting of the elderly by firms engaged in making an estimated billion nuisance calls a year was revealed by a YouGov survey.

It found that more than nine out of 10 elderly people had been subjected to a nuisance sales call or a text over the past month, and nearly a quarter said they had at least two a day.

While 92 per cent of those over 60 received at least one call or text, 23 per cent said they received two or more a day. This compared with just six per cent of people under 25 receiving nuisance calls at the same rate.

The survey, carried out for the Sunday Times, said three out of four people who received unwanted sales calls said they hung up, half refused to answer the call, but fewer than one in six made a complaint. More than half called for stronger Governent regulation of phone marketing companies.

Overwhelmingly nuisance calls came from companies trying to take over payment protection insurance claims. 

Nearly three quarters, 73 per cent, of people had been called by firsm seeking to profit from PPI claims that can be easily and simply made by those wrongly sold loan insurance without professional help.

Some 54 per cent had calls from debt management firms and 38 per cent had taken nuisance calls from solar panel salesmen. More than a quarter reported sales calls they did not want from energy or phone companies and 16 per cent said they had unwanted sales calls from banks.

Details of older callers are traded by companies that sell on details of people who have bought from them, and in some cases by lead generator companies that glean details of elderly people using methods like fake advertisements.

Marketing firms that use sucker lists rely on the assumption that some older people will welcome a friendly voice on the phone and some are easily persuaded to part with their money.

The targeting of older people was detailed following a report by the Government-appointed Nuisance Calls Task Force which demanded £500,000 fines for firms which break marketing rules and for directors of companies to be held personally responsible for breaches of the rules.

Its report said there should be tougher regulation of firms making unwanted calls which cause ‘severe distress’.
