Gerard Pique says Barcelona duo Lionel Messi and Neymar 'are as good as ever'. 

Messi assisted both goals as Neymar scored twice in Barcelona's 2-0 win over Athletic Bilbao on Saturday. 

And Pique has praised the connection between his two two superstar team-mates ahead of the club's Champions League clash with Apoel Nicosia on Wednesday.

He said: 'Messi and Neymar are as good as ever. This season, they both have a lot of quality and when they connect it's amazing,' the Spain defender said at a press conference. 'They are two of the best in the world and they play together.'

Pique, however, said Barcelona could not be expected to win the Champions League every season. The club last lifted the trophy in 2011 and last season crashed out in the quarter-final stage after losing to Atletico Madrid. 

'If we had to win the Champions League every couple of seasons, that would be a very tough task,' the defender said. 

'We have a very good generation which we have to make the most of. We have won lots of titles and we expect to win a lot more but that doesn't mean we think we can win the Champions League all the time.'

In La Liga, Barcelona are flying - with three wins in as many games - and have already opened up a six-point game over rivals Real Madrid. But Pique is urging caution and says Real must not be written off yet.  

He added: 'We have started with nine points in the league but that doesn't mean the league will be easy or a done deal.

'It'll be a tough competition until the very end so I don't think Madrid will be far behind us.'
