A black Sacramento State University student has sparked outrage after she 'lynched' two white males from a tree on campus for an art project that focused on civil rights.

The student, Christina Edwards, a senior, said she chose the 'race reversal' performance art because she believed it would send a strong message about the social injustices African Americans suffered and the inequality that still exist today.

And a strong message it has sent, with the University now claiming it didn't approve of the display that saw the men dangling from the tree with nooses around their necks.

The men were reportedly actors and 
were not harmed or in danger during the performance, which took place in
 early December while students were on campus.

Art project: Sacramento State University student Christina Edwards has sparked outrage after she 'lynched' two white males from a tree on campus for an art project, pictured, that focused on civil rights

They were dangling from the same tree with thick rope, and pictures of the pair were shared on social media.

However, Edwards has vehemently defended her project, telling Fox News in a written statement that she thought using white men would help shine new light on the horrifying time when black people were lynched simply for the color of their skin. She said this was an old but standing matter and she wanted to record the responses of students and others on campus.

She also insisted she followed all campus procedures.

'My choice to cross racial lines was intentional to create an open opportunity to personalize and empathize with his-story as a people and hopefully initiate compassion and change in terms of social and racial availability and equality,' Edwards wrote.

She added that her purpose wasn't to 
offend anyone, she just wanted to draw attention to the continued racial
 inequality in the U.S.Â 

'The
 purpose of this performance was to bring to light social injustices and
 the issue of inequality that impacts me and my community as a whole,' 
Edwards said.

But it had mixed reviews.

Sacremento State student Alexander Richmond was supportive of the work.

Campus: University President Alexander Gonzalez said the project that was on campus, pictured, in early December raised 'multiple issues.'

'I think it's more impactful when you use actual people, sends a stronger message that just a painting,' he said.

One of the two actors, who declined to be named, told student publication the Campus Culture that the display was intended to be 'provocative.'

'If you switch the context up it would be provocative in that sense, which signifies the lack of acknowledgement and recognition of the original context and crime,' he said, according to RT.com.

But University President Alexander Gonzalez said the project raised 'multiple issues.'

'It appears that the individuals involved did not intend for the display to incite violence, though it offended members of our community,' he wrote.

'The university did not approve the display, and I want to assure everyone that I am working to address the multiple issues raised by this incident,' he told Fox News.
