Demba Ba's tormenting times of Liverpool have continued following the Reds' Europa League exit at the hands of Besiktas on Thursday night.

Just hours after helping the Turkish club progress to the last 16 of the tournament following a dramatic penalty shoouout, the 29-year-old took to social media to revel in the delight of their triumph.

Accompanied with the caption: 'Greatest moment of my Besiktas career. The fans today: OH MY GOD. #respect #bjk #carsi #bigblackkartal' the striker uploaded an Instagram photo of himself celebrating among a backdrop of crestfallen Liverpool players.

Ba has a history of causing the Reds heartache.

Last season his opener for Chelsea all but ended their Premier League title hopes as he capitalised on captain Steven Gerrard's famous slip at Anfield to help the Blues secure a 2-0 win.

And on Thursday he proved Brendan Rodgers' side chief tormentor once more after playing a key role in their goal to level the tie before almost winning it in the dying moments of normal time when his shot smashed against the crossbar.

However, Ba was on hand once more to inflict pain on the English giants as he tucked away a penalty for the hosts in the shootout before Dejan Lovren's miss saw them progress to the next round of the tournament.

The Turkish side will next face Belgian opposition Club Brugge in the next round of the draw.
