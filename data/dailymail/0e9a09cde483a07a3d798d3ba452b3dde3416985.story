Shoplifters have been posting DVDs and stolen goods to themselves from a Post Office inside an Asda store.

Thieves have been picking up box-sets, films, computer games and CDs from the entertainment department of the Ellesmere Port store in Cheshire.

They then put the items into envelopes and take them to the in-store Post Office to send them to themselves - meaning they don't have to try and sneak the stolen goods past security.

The Asda Supercentre in Ellesmere Port, Cheshire has been forced to move padded envelopes and boxes

The store's bosses have now been forced to put padded envelopes and postage boxes behind a desk in a bid to stop the scam.

It is not known for how long thieves have been using the method to steal from the shop, but the dishonest scheme came to light when a customer could not find packing boxes in the store.

In a Facebook post reported in the Liverpool Echo, the customer wrote: 'Upon asking at the Post Office counter where I might find a large parcel packet, I was told to go to the other end of the store.

'Asking the guy behind the counter why they keep post office accessories behind the entertainment desk, he told me the funniest reason ever.'

Thieves had been putting DVDs, computer games and CDs into padded envelopes then sending them to their home address, to avoid having to pass through security gates

The Facebook message added: 'It's because people used to pick them off the shelves, stuff DVDs and such like into them from the store, then post it back to themselves.

'The Post Office then takes it away without you going through the alarm gate.'

An Asda spokesman said: 'We take shoplifting very seriously and work with the local police to ensure this doesn't happen in our stores.

'This allows us to continue to offer the low prices that customers expect from Asda.'
