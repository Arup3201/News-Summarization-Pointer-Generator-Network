A woman was secretly filmed carrying buckets and bags of hay while she pocketed more than £3,000 in disability benefits having claimed she could barely walk. 

Carmen Smith, 46, was caught during a survillance operation on the moors last year lugging the objects in heavy snow and freezing temperatures before sorting horse feed.

Smith had initially claimed a disability living allowance legitimately as she said she was virtually unable to walk. She had told authorities she needed help with her personal care and could not move around without help

But the Teesside Crown Court heard Smith never told authorities when her health improved, meaning she was payed £3,227 in benefits she wasn't entitled to. 

Prosecutor Jonathan Walker said: 'When her mobility and ability to function improved, she was under a legal duty to inform the department.

'There had been a significant improvement.'

Smith told investigators she did not think her condition had improved that much and that she was suffering terribly from depression and could not do anything without painkillers.  

Smith, of Moorsholm, East Cleveland, admitted one charge of failing to promptly notify the Department for Work and Pensions of a change in her circumstances.

Peter Sabiston, defending, said Smith's 'improvement was somewhat transitory'.

He said: 'There was a period of improvement. It was relatively gradual. It was assisted by drugs.

Smith's lawyer said his client's health had improved gradually and she was 'assisted by drugs', but on reflection she realised she should of alerted authorities to her change in circumstances

'When confronted with the CCTV she realised upon reflection she should have reported it to the Department for Work and Pensions.

'She's lost her good character, something she'll never get back.'

Mr Sabiston said Smith's financial and personal circumstances weighed heavily on her, and she now had to deal with her mother's diagnosis with cancer.

Judge Peter Bowers told Smith: 'I accept that this claim started off completely genuine.

'Over time with treatment your health did improve, but you continued to claim disability living allowance.

'The amount that you were overpaid will be eventually recovered by the department.'

Bearing in mind her personal circumstances, the judge gave Smith a one-year supervision order, saying she needed the Probation Service's help and guidance.
