A secondary school teacher has been sacked after calling her own pupils 'feral' in a series of bizarre rants on social media.  

Lauren Rose, who brands herself a 'troublemaker', also called one child 'cowface' as she posted profanity-filled tweets complaining about her work.  

Fellow Twitter users warned her that the posts were 'unethical', and today her school announced that she had been fired over the 'totally unacceptable' messages.  

Fired: Lauren Rose has been sacked by Ifield Community College in Crawley over a series of tweets

Miss Rose was working as a supply teacher at Ifield Community College in Crawley, West Sussex when she posted the tweets.  

One of them read: 'Not sure I have the energy (or desire) to teach feral kids all day - The f*** is wrong with Crawley children?'  

Another stated: 'You wouldn't believe the cowface I taught yesterday - or didn't as she was swiftly kicked out of the class.'  

Miss Rose, who described herself as a 'subtly charming troublemaker' in her Twitter profile, also wrote: 'Douchey year 8 thinks this in an acceptable total amount of work to have produced in a whole 8 weeks.'  

When other web users complained that she was being 'unethical', the teacher replied: 'Then I'll deal with the consequences.'  

Profile: Miss Rose made her Twitter profile private after the controversial posts came to light

The school launched an investigation after one critic, Laura Fitch, contacted them to alert them to Miss Rose's tweets.  

She said the teacher was 'not setting a good example', adding that she was 'appalled' to see Miss Rose behaving so unprofessionally.

This morning, acting headmaster Richard Cowper announced that the teacher had been sacked with immediate effect.  

'We feel that the Twitter comments are totally unacceptable, bringing the college and the teaching profession into disrepute,' he said.  

'As a result we have taken full and immediate disciplinary action.'  

Defiant: When other tweeters, complained, Miss Rose replied: 'I'll deal with the consequences'

Earlier, he said: 'I would not expect a teacher to talk about their students, especially not in that way.'  

One parent, who asked not to be named, said: 'Teachers have to be so careful what they write on social media.  

'One slip and you're in trouble, but to be honest if you call a pupil cowface and the rest of them feral you are hardly likely to keep your job for long.'  

Miss Rose refused to comment on the controversy, and made her Twitter profile private after the messages came to light.

She told the Crawley News the kids at the school were 'lovely', adding: 'It's a good school and the staff do a great job.'
