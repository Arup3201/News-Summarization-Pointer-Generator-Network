Injured Liam Davies battled through the pain to conjure an amazing fightback and ensure Collingtree Park were crowned men’s champions in the Mail on Sunday Classic.

Just 10 days before the grand finals, the electrician fell off the roof of a house he is building and injured his ribs as he landed on a supporting wall although that stopped him dropping a further 20 feet.

‘I realise how lucky I am to be here,’ said Davies. ‘I stepped where I thought there was something and fell. My first thought when I hit the wall was that’s it, I can’t play.’

The six-handicapper was in agony and did not play in the semi-final against Worthing, which his club won 3-2, but he agreed to play against experienced Seaton Carew. The team from Hartlepool had knocked out The Shire London in the other semi-final after Robert McGahan beat John Murray in a nail-biting shootout which was decided at the 20th hole.

It was the third time the club had reached the grand finals of the biggest golf club team event in the world and the talent in their ranks was reflected in a combined handicap of just two.

Yet there was added motivation for Collingtree Park. They were desperate to win for their club captain, Adrian Kilshaw, who is recovering from heart surgery.

He suffered a heart attack during the Northampton club’s first-round match, but recovered to help them through some of the later rounds. Three weeks ago he underwent further surgery which prevented him from taking part in the finals.

Dan Messom, took the first point for Collingtree Park, winning 3&2 at the testing North Course at El Rompido. Andy Billson increased their lead with a 5&3 win.

Seaton Carew then levelled the tie with a 5&3 victory for Jonathan Conley and McGahan won 4&3.

Davies, who needed pain-killers and wore strapping, was two down after 11 holes against Kris Diamond but the 49-year-old managed to sink a 15-foot putt at the 12th to stay in the match.

‘If I didn’t get that the game would have been pretty much all over. The last thing I wanted was for it all to come down to me, but that’s what happened,’ he said.

Despite the pressure, Davies went on to claw back the deficit with a birdie at the 13th and notching a par at the 14th to go all square. He then holed a 40-foot putt at the tricky 16th to go one up and gain the upper hand.

At the crucial 17th, Diamond hit his tee shot out of bounds but just when it looked like Davies could take advantage, his second shot bounced in to some long grass and it seemed that his ball had been lost.

But in true sporting fashion, Seaton Carew supporters found it, allowing Davies to go on and win 2&1 and seal Collingtree Park’s 3-2 triumph.

Billson summed up the emotion, saying: ‘As an amateur golfer, it doesn’t get any better. The fact one of Seaton Carew’s supporters found our ball epitomised what the game of golf is about. They should be very proud of their club.

‘It is a totally unbelievable victory because of how good they were. Our mantra has always been keep the match alive as long as you can and there’s always a chance.’

The tears flowed as Lin Kay’s team became the pride of Farnham by winning the women’s title in the Mail on Sunday Classic.

The Surrey club notched a 4-1 victory over Whittington Heath and club champion Karen Stevens, who won 4 & 3, said: ‘Although we all wanted to win our own matches, we wanted to do it for Farnham. We wanted to do it for the people at home and put us on the map.’

With no single handicappers, and knowing they would face more experienced golfers at El Rompido, the team were given team golf lessons and took on a men’s team in preparation for the main event — and beat them 4-1.

In the semi-final they saw off an experienced side from South Moor 4-1 while Whittington Heath knocked out Sale 3-2.

Team captain Kay had to make some difficult decisions, as she had a squad of six players and made a tactical switch for the final.

She replaced club captain Judith Nicoll who had won in the semi-final with Melanie Wilson.

Kay said: ‘You have to use every shot you can. I told them before we came out that one would play one day and one the next.

‘I chose Judith for the semi-finals as she was getting one extra shot. Melanie came back fighting. I didn’t need to give the girls a pep talk. They were so up for it.’

Nicoll added: ‘Lin made very good decisions and I think that helped. She showed her faith in everybody. She’s been brilliant.’

All the team refer to Elaine Lewis as their ‘rock’ and she showed why. In the semi-final the 16-handicapper came back from four down to clinch a vital half and in the final she fought back from three down to win 2&1.

‘It’s totally amazing little old Farnham have done this. The whole club is behind us and they’ve been calling us the pride of Farnham,’ said Lewis.

Kate Sear, who went out first for the team and halved her match admitted: ‘It was petrifying. I did not stop shaking. It was up and down all day. We only had three halves all the way through. I was terrified I’d lose for the team, so I dug in to get the half.’

Val Talbot, who won 3&1, said: ‘It’s helped my golf. It seriously has improved my concentration.’

And Wilson, who secured another half, summed up the success when she added: ‘It’s been like being a lady pro for three days. You watch it on telly and you see these really confident ladies and we’ve just tasted that. It’s been wonderful.’
