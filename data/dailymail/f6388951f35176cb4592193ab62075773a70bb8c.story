David Beckham was involved in a car accident this morning after picking up his son Brooklyn from Arsenal’s training ground.

Beckham, 39, had been at the training centre at London Colney, Hertfordshire, watching his eldest son Brooklyn, 15, play for the club’s under-16 side against Brighton.

Although the former England captain and his son walked away from the accident unhurt, Beckham's original car was unable to be used.

Arsenal staff ushered onlookers away from the scene and Beckham was driven away in another car. Both were said to be shaken following the accident.

One Brighton youngster, Archie Davies, tweeted: ‘Just seen David Beckham looks like he got in a car crash and hurt his shoulder.’ The teenager then added: ‘Star struck by seeing David Beckham tbh.’

And team-mate Thomas Cadman thought the whole episode was utterly surreal, tweeting: ‘Weird to play against Brooklyn Beckham earlier. Even weirder to be currently stuck behind David Beckham as he has crashed his car.' 

Sources told The Telegraph the accident was 'quite a heavy prang but thankfully everyone walked away uninjured' and that the other car involved had been travelling at 'quite a speed'.

Beckham had been driving an Audi RS6 which was left damaged on the driver's side in the accident. However, its airbags had deployed, the paper reported.

Brighton footballer Archie Davies tweeted that it appeared as though Beckham was injured. He later tweeted he was 'star struck' at seeing the former England international

It's not the first time Beckham has been involved in an car accident - in October last year he collided with a car when pulling out of his driveway in Beverley Hills.

He was allegedly in his black Range Rover Sport with what looked like his son Brooklyn, then aged 14, in the front passenger seat when the collision occurred on the afternoon of October 25.

Police were seen leaving his home, then interviewing witnesses nearby for more information about the accident.

Damage was clearly visible on the white Acura 4x4, as well as David's expensive Range Rover Sport, where the bumper was hanging off the front.

Brooklyn was signed by Arsenal on a short-term contract earlier this month after impressing coaches at The Emirates.  

Brooklyn’s brother Romeo, 12, has also been playing for the club’s under-13s, while youngest son Cruz, nine, has been representing the club’s under-10s.
