Probe: Ian Ousey, the former Chief Financial Officer of FreemantleMedia is said to have claimed around £850,000 from the company over 17 years

A former executive of the company behind The X Factor and American Idol could face fraud allegations over £850,000 he claimed while in the senior role.

Ian Ousey, the ex-chief financial officer of FremantleMedia, is said to have claimed extra money from the company over 17 years by submitting false invoices and payment authorisations.

The expenses allegedly include £237,000 to a holiday home developer in Portugal and £477,000 to cover credit card, cars, mobile phone and courier payments.

The company, who also produce Take Me Out and Grand Designs, are thought to have handed a complaint to the Metropolitan Police.

Mr Ousey, who left the company in March, paid back the 
sum as part of a £1.4million legal settlement last year, but he could still face prosecution.

His assets were frozen after Fremantle obtained a court order following his departure, but it ended when the agreement was reached in December.

He is said to have gone to Holborn police station in Central London in January, after Fremantle reported the allegations, but has not been arrested or charged. 

Rodney Hylton-Potts, Mr Ousey's lawyer, told The Times his client was 'desperately sorry', even though he claims not all of the money was accepted wrongfully.

'He admits wrongfully receiving £237,000 as part of a larger sum yet to be determined. He was very happy to be able to make full repayment, with interest, legal and investigative charges.'

Mr Hylton-Potts, was struck off the solicitors' register and jailed for fraud in the 1990s.

A description on his LinkedIn profile says he is a consultant who is: 'A highly experienced CFO, with a reputation for significant contribution
 to the business, and delivering the best commercial outcome.'

The page also reveals he worked as an Audit Manager for PwC in the 1980s. He then joined Grundy Worldwide in Monaco before moving to London with Pearson Television in 1995.

He was appointed as the Chief Financial Officer of radio producers Audio Network at the beginning of April.

Fremantle said they could not comment at this time for legal reasons.
