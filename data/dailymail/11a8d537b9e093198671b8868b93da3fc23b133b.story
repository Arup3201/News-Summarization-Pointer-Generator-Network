Dressed in her figure-hugging black suit with miniskirt, peep toe black high heels and smiling behind her black wraparound sunglasses, incest matriarch Betty Colt arrived at court with a naughty grin and a 'hello gentleman' for the waiting photographers.

Moments earlier the woman whose family is believed to be the most depraved example of inter-family relationships in Australian history, had stepped from a sleek dark grey late model Ford Territory four-wheel drive.

Ms Colt was wearing the latest of several stylish outfits, all funded by welfare, to a series of court appearances which ended on Monday, when Magistrate Mary Ryan jailed her for twelve months.

Newstart smart: Police officers take Betty Colt iaway in handcuffs following her sentencing at Moss Vale Court in the NSW Southern Highlands. As with every court appearance Ms Colt, who wore a figure-hugging black suit and blue flowered top with peep toe black high heels, has been smartly dressed

Dainty: Despite being handcuffed and loaded off to a Sydney women's prison, Betty Colt manages to maintain her composure and modesty in the back of the NSW Police paddy wagon. She has now sapped her smart black suit for a set of prison greens, with an alternative choice of prison issue maroon or white t-shirts

Conviction: Betty Colt arrived at the Moss Vale Court in the NSW Southern Highland for her conviction dressed in a black pantsuit with a bright yellow shirt, accompanied by daughter Raylene, who was also smartly dressed in a black suit

This goes with that: Betty Colt at Moss Vale court (left) dressed in a black college-style suit with white piping at Moss Vale Court for charges of inciting her son to kidnap his brother, and (right) in a grey suit and fluffy white top with smart grey boots for an appearance in Parramatta Local Court over police demands for family members to give DNA samples

Trim figure: Betty Colt in black court shoes, a yellow patterned top and pantsuits arrives for a court apperance in the NSW Southern Highlands. Police phone transcripts reveal she complained about dwindling welfare payments after five of her 13 children were removed because of incest and neglect

Convicted of inciting her 16-year-old son Bobby to commit a crime, the unemployed mother of 13 children is currently confined to prison greens for at a minimum non-parole period of nine months.

Betty Colt - a court appointed pseudonym to protect the identities of children - doesn't look like a woman discovered living with 38 inter-related adults and children in incestuous relationships and in the filth and squalor of a bush block with only tents and caravans and no running water or electricity.

At each of her court appearances this at Parramatta and at Moss Vale in the NSW Southern Highlands, Ms Colt has turned up dressed smartly in a succession of crisp grey or black suits, with her glossy hair neatly blow dried or swept up and pinned in place with a pretty hair clip.

Mother and daughter: Betty Colt (right) arriving at court this week with her equally well-dressed daughter, Raylene, who wore a yellow, black and white knit skirt with matching yellow top and black jacket. Betty is unemployed and lives on the government Newstart allowance

Complicated: The Colt family tree which shows that matriarch, Betty Colt, has 13 children, five of whom are the product  of a sexual relationship with her father or a brother. Her younger sister, Martha, has five surviving children, all of whom were fathered by her brother Charlie or another relative

Filth and squalor: Police and welfare officers were shocked and appalled with the scenes of filth, squalor and neglect they found children in on the rural property owned by the Colt family. In contrast to the dirty bare feet and low hygeine standards of her children, Betty Colt, has shown to be well-groomed and smartly dressed and drives a late model four-wheel drive car funded by the Australian Government's Newstart allowance

 For the first hearing in which she faced conviction, she wore a black  yellow and white flowered top and skipped across the street in her heels. For the next hearing, when she was convicted, she wore a bright yellow shirt and black pantsuit which showed off her trim figure.

At her sentencing, Ms Colt chose a sky blue top patterned with pink, grey and white flowers.

And it's all done on social security payments. Her lawyer, Phil Carey, revealed that Ms Colt was funded only by a Newstart allowance.

While previously she was funded with government payments for each of her 13 children aged under 18 years, court documents reveal that following the removal of five of her children by authorities, Ms Colt found she was struggling financially.

A NSW Children's Court judge, Peter Johnstone, revealed that in July 2012, officers from the NSW Child Abuse Squad and the Family and Community Services Department swooped on the squalid rural property where the Colt family lived. 

The raid had been prompted by a remark, overheard in the schoolyard, by one of the young family members that his sister was having a baby and that the family didn't know which brother had fathered the child.

The police and welfare officers were shocked and appalled about what the found on the scrub land block in the hills surrounding a picturesque farming community nestled in a valley southwest of Sydney. 

Sisters in grey: Betty and sister Rhonda sit on a  bench outside Parrmatta Local Court after family members appeared to respond to Child Abuse Squad demands they give buccal swabs of their saliva for DNA testingso that authorities could determine the complex inter-family relationships between 38 Colt adults and children

Betty Colt's sister and brother Martha and Charlie slept nightly in a 'marital' bed inside a tent on the squalid farm, where open buckets of faeces and urine lay about and where their children - brothers and sisters - had sex with each other.

The children had facial deformities, could not speak intelligibly, did not know what a toothbrush or toilet paper were.

Unlike well-groomed Betty, the children had filthy, bare feet, did not know how to wash their hair or bathe and slept in dirty beds among cigarette butts and rotting food.

From smiles to tears: Betty Colt was all smiles when she arrived at court on Monday for her sentencing, but she wept after being given 12 months and was then bundled into a van and off to prison

Authorities removed 12 inbred, illiterate and malnourished children from the camp, including five of Betty's children, and placed them in care.

The charges which led to her incarceration relate to the fact Ms Colt could not cope without her children, in particular her teenage sons Billy, 15, and Bobby, 16, the latter of whom Magistrate Ryan said Ms Colt and a 'overbearing and claustrophobic' relationship.

Court files reveal a transcript of unrelenting text messages and phone calls between Betty Colt and Bobby and give an insight into the cloying influence she wreaked upon her son.

Magistrate Ryan said Ms Colt's failed bid to kidnap her son from care and return him to the circumstances of neglect and rampant sexual abuse at the hands of relatives from which they were taken into care.

She was sentenced at Moss Vale Court this week for devising a plan to get her both teenage sons, out of state care.

Ms Colt's welfare payments had started to dwindle after five of her children were removed amid allegations of inter-generational incest and abuse.

When she was sentenced in Moss Vale Local Court on Monday, she was on Newstart allowance, the court heard.

In the one of the phone calls, she mentions that Centrelink was trying to stop her money. Police prosecutors said the matriarch wanted to take the boys to South Australia where they could work as fruit pickers and give the income to her, which Betty's lawyer denied in court.

In phone conversations between Colt and Bobby heard by police, Colt defended police claims she didn't provide for her son.

'They think I didn't educate you enough and I couldn't afford the dentist,' she told  Bobby. 'That's only minor.'
