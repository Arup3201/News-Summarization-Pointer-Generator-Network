Rapper ScHoolboy Q was in a vehicle that was fired on after a concert at the popular Red Rocks outdoor amphitheater in Colorado, but he was not injured, investigators said today.

Three other people were hurt in the shooting late Thursday in the parking lot at Red Rocks, but their injuries were not life-threatening, and one was discharged from the hospital Friday.

Investigators do not know whether Q was targeted in the shooting, said Jacki Kelley, a spokeswoman for the Jefferson County Sheriff's Department.

Q is a Los Angeles rapper whose most recent album Oxymoron opened at No. 1 earlier this year.

Police and sheriff's deputies were searching for a man with a rifle, but no arrests had been made.

Q and at least four other people were in a white sport-utility vehicle that was fired on at Red Rocks, in the foothills west of Denver, Kelley said.

They drove themselves to a Denver intersection about 15 miles away, apparently in search of a hospital, she said.

They were eventually stopped by Denver police and taken to a hospital. Q and another uninjured person were briefly handcuffed while police determined the situation, Kelley said, but no one in the vehicle was arrested.

Investigators don't know the motive for the shooting, Kelley said. "It just happened 12 hours ago. We have a lot to learn," she said.
