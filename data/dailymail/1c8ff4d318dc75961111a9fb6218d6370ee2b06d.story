Liverpool players returned to training with a noticeable spring in their step following Monday night's impressive 4-1 hammering of Swansea City.

Brendan Rodgers' festive revival has seen the Reds take seven points from their last three games to finish the year in eighth place in the Premier League ahead of the New Year's Day visit of Leicester City.

Adam Lallana bagged a brace after Alberto Moreno had opened the scoring against Swansea, while a final own goal from former Liverpool midfielder Jonjo Shelvey will  also have raised a smile from players at Melwood on the morning after.

Most of the players that featured against the Swans, except for Mario Balotelli who made a late substitute appearance, appeared to be rested on Tuesday morning - but it was clear to see how the infectious nature of a good result breeds confidence throughout the club.

Monday night's result was also the first time that Liverpool have scored four goals in a game without Luis Suarez - dating back 34 games to the 4-0 dismantling of Tottenham on March 30 2013, which provided the catalyst for a title run-in that came within two points of being crowned champions.

Two-goal hero Lallana admits Liverpool have struggled to live up to the expectations of last season but is confident the side can now kick on in 2015.

He told Sky Sports: 'It's a massive, massive result. We said before the game it was important we got back-to-back wins and I thought the lads were brilliant. 

'We've turned a corner the last few weeks but we're still not there yet by any means. I always knew it would be different, no disrespect to Southampton, but the pressures are always different coming to Liverpool and a team like this. 

'The expectations from last season may have come as a bit of shock to the players and some of the new players but Emre (Can) came in today and was outstanding.'
