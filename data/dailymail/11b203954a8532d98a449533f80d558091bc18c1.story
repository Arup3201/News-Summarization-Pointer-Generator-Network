Deep in a Russian forest lies a secretive training facility intended to prepare people for a voyage into space.

Few outsiders have ever seen it with their own eyes - but one photographer has now gained rare access to the heart of the Russian space programme.

Mitch Karunaratne took the snaps of the highly secret Star City complex - known in Russian as Zvezdniy Gorodok - inside forests around 30 miles (48 kilometres) from Moscow.

Photographer Mitch Karunaratne from London has taken rare photos of Russia's Star City. The facility is located deep in a forest about 30 miles (48 km) from Moscow Pictured is a Sokol spacesuit used by cosmonauts when travelling to and from space

The centre, run by the Russian Federal Space Agency (Roscosmos), is in a closed town where the legendary cosmonaut Yuri Gagarin trained.

12 April 1961 - First human in space (Yuri Gagarin)

5 May 1961 - First American in space (Alan Shepard)

16 June 1963 - First woman in space (Valentina Tereshkova)

21 July 1969 - First human on the moon (Neil Armstrong)

7 June 1971 - First manned space station (Soyuz 11/Salyut 1)

12 April 1981 - First manned space plane (Space Shuttle/STS-1)

20 November 1998 - Construction of the International Space Station (ISS) begins

15 October 2003 - First Chinese taikonaut in space (Yang Liwei) 

In fact it was previously named after Gagarin and his family still live within the area of the centre.

Today - despite the area no longer being a military zone in 2008 - it remains difficult for outsiders to gain access.

'I grew up as self-proclaimed space fanatic - I was born in 1969 - and a photograph of Neil Armstrong landing on the moon has always hung in every house I've ever lived in and I've met Buzz Aldrin,' said Mr Karunaratne, from London.

'I grew up in the era of Star Trek and Star Wars and the Clangers, however the Russian space programme was always on the fringes, always mysteriously out of reach I felt.

'Star City is up and running and still the main space training centre for all international cosmonauts and astronauts visiting the space station as well as the centre for the Russian space programme.

'It is located about 30 miles [48 kilometres] east of Moscow, set within a deeply wooded area and it doesn't appear on any maps or have road signs.

'It is a "closed" town - and very tricky to get access to and has a heavily guarded border and access is for residents and space trainees.'

The Star City facility is located deep in a forest about 30 miles (48 km) from Moscow

Star City is used to train astronauts and cosmonauts for missions to space. Shown here is a centrifuge, which is used to test how cosmonauts respond to the intense G-forces experienced in take-off and landing

Training facilities like these are used by agencies to prepare astronauts for missions in space. Seen here are mock-ups of modules from the ISS, which cosmonauts use to familiarise themselves with the layout before they travel to the space station

The Sokol spacesuit, shown, was first introduced in 1973 and is still in use by cosmonauts today. It is only worn during take-off and landing, however, and is used to keep astronauts alive in the event of their spacecraft depressurising. For spacewalks a separate Orlan suit is used

The centre was established in the 1960s and was originally called the Yuri Gagarin Cosmonaut Training Centre.

Since then it has trained at least 400 astronauts - or cosmonauts as they are called in Russia - from more than 30 different countries.'

'All personnel involved in the Soviet and Russian space programme, and their descendants have the right to live here,' Mr Karunaratne continued.

'It houses both space training installation buildings, as well as accommodation, shop, church and a school. Yuri Gagarin's family still live here.'

Mr Karunaratne said inside the complex there were several life-size mock-ups of the International Space Station used for training. 

One is even submerged in a swimming pool where cosmonauts can practice their space walks, although Mr Karunaratne was not allowed to take photos in this area.

the short-lived Buran shuttle that completed one unmanned flight in 
1988. In the middle is Sputnik 1, the world's first artificial 
satellite, which launched in 1957. On the right is Buran attached to the
 Energia rocket that took it to space

The facility is used to prepare astronauts and cosmonauts for trips to the ISS (pictured)

Shown here is a mock-up of the Soyuz spacecraft used to take astronauts to the ISS. The Soyuz family of spacecraft has been in operation since the 1960s, although it has been continuously upgraded since then

Shown here is  a statue of Yuri Gagarin, who on 12 April 1961 became the first human ever to travel to space. Star City was once also known as the Yuri Gagarin Cosmonaut Training Centre

The centre also contains technology from the history of Russia's space endeavours (shown). There is also a mock-up of the ISS in a swimming pool cosmonauts can use, although Mr Karunaratne was not allowed to take photos in this area

'All cosmonauts from the Soviet space programme and then the Russian Federation Space Agency have trained at this facility,' he added.

'The facility has a very lived in look, but is cared for with such obvious pride. The heart and soul of the Russian space programme, and indeed the Russia people, can be felt very profoundly here.

'Dreams of outer space have been a constant in Soviet society since the 1920s, which have survived perestroika and the break up of the Soviet Union in 1991.

'Access was limited, and although I was able to walk around with my guide freely I was not able to take photographs [everywhere].

'The image of the lake Yuri Gagarin helped to dig, the supermarket where all goods are plentiful and cheap, the washing of the current space team pegged to a green nylon rail - will forever be those images I wish I had taken.'

'It is a "closed" town - and very tricky to get access to and has a heavily guarded border and access is for residents and space trainees,' said Mr Karunaratn. Shown is a mock-up of a docking module on the ISS

The facility apparently has a very lived in look but is 'cared for with pride' according to Mr Karunaratn. Seen on the left are some interconnected mock-ups of ISS modules at Star City, while on the right is Nasa's own ISS mockup at the Lyndon B. Johnson Space Center
