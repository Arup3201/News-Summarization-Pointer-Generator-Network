Gallipoli is a burial ground. A terrible reminder of the violence of war.

It’s where men of all ages, neighbourhoods and nationalities were stripped down to their common human thread of flesh and blood and bone.

A remarkable set of circumstances we call The Lost Stories of Anzac, which airs on 60 Minutes, at 8.10pm on the Nine Network tonight.

I went there with a number of family members, all of whom were learning for the first time what had happened to their Gallipoli soldiers.

And I watched as they were confronted by the horror and the sadness, the brutality and the bravery that had occurred.

It was all felt deeply by 21-year-old Ashley Vines.

Richard Vines, Ashley Vines and Gallipoli historian Michael McKernan are pictured in the grounds of Scotch College, which has played host to five generations of the Vines family. Ashley (middle) and his great grandfather were both vice-captain of the cricket team, 100 years apart 

60 Minutes reporter Liz Hayes wrote for Daily Mail Australia that 'I went there with a number of family members, all who were learning for the first time what had happened to their Gallipoli soldiers. And I watched as they were confronted by the horror and the sadness, the brutality and the bravery that had occurred'

He carries his great grandfather’s name. Both were vice-captains at Melbourne Scotch College and both were great sportsmen. The difference is, 100 years ago, Ashley senior went to war.

I could see that as he and his dad Richard walked the trenches and looked up at the cliffs from Anzac Cove … Ashley suddenly understood what it must have been like.

Ashley Vines snr was in the second wave of Australians to hit the shore on April 25th, 1915 and even as he and his mates saw the diggers in front of them being mowed down … they still ran forward.

Richard and Ashley Vines jnr at Gallipoli to retrace the steps of Ashley Vines snr, 'I could not even imagine getitng off a boat with all these other Australians and almost facing certain death'

Nearing the top of the cliffs, Ashley Vines was shot.

But in what was an extraordinary act of courage, he survived with the help of a schoolmate.

Allan Vowles had not seen his schoolmate since kindergarten, but out here in the battlefield now littered with bodies … he recognised Ashley Vines and for the next five hours, dodging bullets, helped carry him back down to the beach to safety.

It is a story that strikes a very emotional chord.

Like all of us, 21-year-old Ashley Vines and his dad, Richard, are in awe of the friendship and bravery displayed that day.

But there is something else too … the realisation that had Allan not saved their great grandfather and grandfather … today neither of them would be standing at Gallipoli.

The very best and very worst took place at Gallipoli.

As I walked amongst the bodies now buried in cemetery after cemetery I couldn’t help but feel terribly sad.

'Initially they thought, let's stick together, why don't we go in and form a public schools company and we'll fight together'. The historian tells the relatives of Ashley Vines snr how he came about to be fighting in Gallipoli with some of his closest mates

I understand why we cling to those stories of great Australian mateship and courage; the humanity that still survived despite the horrors that engulfed them all … because without them, I can only feel despair.

The truth is, there was little else to celebrate about this battle.
