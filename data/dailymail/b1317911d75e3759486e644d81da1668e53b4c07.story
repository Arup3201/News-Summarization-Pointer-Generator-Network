Screaming family members of passengers on the missing Malaysia Airlines jet were forcibly removed from a hotel room after invading a press conference which was about to start and accusing the Malaysian 
government of failing to work hard enough to find the plane.

Half a dozen people held up banners blaming the government of inaction 
as airline officials desperately tried to resume order.

But one women screamed: 'You are traitors to us... you have let us down. Tell us the truth! We want the truth!'

During the press conference, Malaysia's
 Acting Transport Minister Hishammuddin Hussein said officials had received further radar data, but were 'not at liberty to release information from other countries'

Emotions running high: Relatives were forcibly removed after invading a hotel room where a press conference was about to take place on the investigation into the disappearance of flight MH370

Two women, believed to be relatives of 
passengers on board the missing plane, were forcibly removed from the 
news conference and taken to another room, Sky News has reported.

A media scrum then followed as they were moved from the room to another part of the hotel.

Sky News reporter Kay Burley appeared to fall while getting off an escalator as the two women were chased by members of the media.

Investigators searching for the missing Malaysia Airlines plane have, meanwhile, discounted reports the plane may have been sighted over the Maldives.

Several residents of Kudahuvadhoo, one
 of the more remote atolls in the Indian Ocean island chain nation, had 
reported seeing a low-flying aircraft on the morning of March 8, when 
Flight MH370 disappeared en route from Kuala Lumpur to Beijing.

Hishammuddin Hussein told a daily news 
conference today that the reports had been investigated by police in the
 Maldives and were determined to be untrue.

The anger of the Chinese group reflected 
the fury of other relatives in Beijing who have threatened to go on a 
hunger strike unless more details about the search for the flight were 
immediately released.

During the press conference Hishammuddin said he 'fully understands' the frustration of the relatives of the missing passengers and said a high-level delegation was being sent to Beijing to speak to the families.

He later ordered an inquiry into the incident where security guards carried out the distraught mother of one of the passengers.

Hishammuddin also told the news conference Malaysia had received radar data from other countries.

He
 said: 'I can confirm that we have received some radar data, but we are 
not at liberty to release information from other countries.'

Other developments and new theories surrounding the ongoing mystery of the missing plane today included:

It has also been reported today that a source close to the investigation said investigators believe the plane most likely flew into the southern Indian Ocean.

No wreckage has been found from Flight MH370, which vanished from air traffic control screens off Malaysia's east coast at 1:21 a.m. local time on March 8, less than an hour after taking off from Kuala Lumpur bound for Beijing.

An unprecedented search for the Boeing 
777-200ER is under way involving 26 nations in two vast search 
'corridors': one arcing north overland from Laos towards the Caspian 
Sea, the other curving south across the Indian Ocean from west of 
Indonesia's Sumatra island to west of Australia.

'The working assumption is that it went 
south, and furthermore that it went to the southern end of that 
corridor,' said the source.

The view is based on the lack of any 
evidence from countries along the northern corridor that the plane 
entered their airspace, and the failure to find any trace of wreckage in
 searches in the upper part of the southern corridor.

China,
 which is leading the northern corridor search with Kazakhstan, said it 
had not yet found any sign of the aircraft crossing into its territory.

Tens of thousands of signatures have been written on a prayer wall at Kuala Lumpur Airport, begging MH370 and its passengers to come home

Malaysian
 and U.S. officials believe the aircraft was deliberately diverted 
perhaps thousands of miles off course, but an exhaustive background 
search of the passengers and crew aboard has not yielded anything that 
might explain why.

Tens of thousands of signatures have been written on a prayer wall at Kuala Lumpur Airport, begging MH370 and its passengers to come home.

Airline officials said they were deeply touched by the vast public response and by the faith shown by most of those who signed - a faith that the jet might be found and the passengers will be still alive.

Most of the signatures, which have swelled by the thousands each day, say their prayers are with the passengers with most messages saying simply: MH370, Come Home Safely.

Investigators are also trying to restore files deleted last month from the home flight simulator of the pilot aboard the missing plane to see if they shed any light on the disappearance, Malaysia's defence minister said today.

Hishammuddin Hussein told a news 
conference that the pilot, Capt. Zaharie Ahmad Shah, is considered 
innocent until proven guilty of any wrongdoing, and that members of his 
family are cooperating in the investigation.

Files containing records of simulations carried out on the program were deleted February 3, Malaysian police chief Khalid Abu said.

Deleting files would not necessarily represent anything unusual, especially if it were to free up memory space, but investigators would want to check the files for any signs of unusual flight paths that could help explain where the missing plane went.

Malaysian authorities have not ruled out any possible explanations, but have said the evidence so far suggests the flight was deliberately turned back across Malaysia to the Strait of Malacca. They are unsure what happened next.

Police are considering the possibility of hijacking, sabotage, terrorism or issues related to the mental health of the pilots or anyone else on board, and have asked for background checks from abroad on all foreign passengers.

Hishammuddin said such checks have been received for all the foreigners except those from Ukraine and Russia - which account for three passengers - and that nothing suspicious has turned up so far.

Planes sweeping across vast expanses of the Indian Ocean and satellites peering on Central Asia have turned up no new clues in the hunt.

'It's really too much. I don't know why it is taking so long for so many people to find the plane. It's 12 days,' Subaramaniam Gurusamy, 60, said in an interview from his home on the outskirts of Kuala Lumpur. His 34-year-old son, Pushpanathan Subramaniam, was on the flight heading to Beijing for a work trip.

'He's the one son I have,' Subaramaniam said.

Aircraft from Australia, the U.S. and New Zealand on Wednesday scoured a search area stretching across 117,000 square miles of the Indian Ocean, about 1,600 miles southwest of Perth, on Australia's west coast. Merchant ships were also asked to look for any trace of the plane.

Nothing has been found, the Australian Maritime Safety Authority said.

China has said it was reviewing radar data and deployed 21 satellites to search the northern corridor of the search area stretching as far as Kazakhstan, although it is considered less likely that the plane could have taken that route without being detected.

Those searches so far have turned up no trace of the plane, Chinese Foreign Ministry spokesman Hong Lei said Wednesday.

Indonesian Defense Minister Purnomo Yusgiantoro said Indonesia military radar didn't pick up any signs of Flight 370 on the day the plane went missing. He said Malaysia had asked Indonesia to intensify the search in its assigned zone in the Indian Ocean west of Sumatra, but said his air force was strained in the task.

'We will do our utmost. We will do our best. But you do have to understand our limitations,' Purnomo said.

Hismammuddin said both the southern and the northern sections of the search area were important, but that 'some priority was being given to that (southern) area.' He did not elaborate.
