The Duchess of Cambridge is arguably the most famous woman in the world and has fans and photographers following her every move.

But one young woman says she experiences exactly the same as Kate and can't walk around her home town of 
Windsor without being mobbed by tourists - because she looks just like 
the Duchess.

Gabriella Munro-Douglas claims that coach loads of visitors surround the her in the hope of getting a photograph every time she goes out in the royal Berkshire town mistaking her for the famous Royal.

Kate-a-like: Gabriella Munro-Douglas cannot walk around her home town of Windsor without being mobbed by tourists - because she looks just like the Duchess of Cambridge

The 26-year-old brunette has now decided to cash in on the striking resemblance and secured a job as a Kate-alike.

Dressed in a black and white polka-dot dress from Topshop - which the former Kate Middleton was previously pictured wearing and subsequently caused to sell out- it is clear that the resemblance is quite striking.

Police outside Windsor Castle regularly ask Gabriella to move on because the crowds block the road when they stop and stare and officers have even asked her for 
ID when they feared she could try to sneak past security guards, posing 
as the 31-year-old princess.

Gabriella, a former public schoolgirl, takes the whole experience in her stride, politely posing, smiling and chatting to admirers.

She said: 'It is so much fun being Kate's look-a-like and people are so nice and friendly to me all the time.

'But getting mobbed is quite bizarre and is like a snapshot of being a celebrity.

'In a few minutes I go from being my normal self to putting my dress on and people following me around.

'When they start to crowd around it can be intimidating.'

The Kingston University graduate was born and bred in Windsor, where her builder father lives.

She says she has always loved the royal family and went to garter ceremonies when she was at Windsor Girls' School.

She cherishes the day as a 14-year-old when Prince William held a door open for her at Eton College, where he studied.

And she said it is now 'weird' thinking about how she looks so much like his wife.

However, it does have its downside - especially when she wants to visit Windsor Castle with friends.

Wearing a foam bump - to look more like the pregnant duchess - she said: 'Police officers have stopped me when I was with friends and checked my details as thought I was trying to sneak into one of the rooms as Kate.'

Speaking about her job as a Duchess of Cambridge look-a-like she said: 'People were saying to me I looked like her and I thought it would be an interesting opportunity and fun.'

It is a far cry from her 9 to 5 job as a furniture designer and buyer.

Her agency has 120 Duchesses on the books, but Gabriella is in demand and was used by photographer Alison Jackson in recent tongue-in-cheek royal portraits.

Gabriella can earn up to £1,000 per appearance, but has had to turn down some requests.

She said: 'I had people asking if I would pose topless after the Duchess was snapped on holiday in France.

'I don't want to tarnish Kate's image and do not want to do anything to damage mine or her reputation.'

Much of her spare time is spent looking at articles on Kate, to see if her appearance has changed and at what clothes she has been wearing.

And she takes criticism of the Duchess by friends or in newspaper articles 'personally' as she feels close to her.

Gabriella says she will 'make hay while the sun shines', and has no idea how long she will carry on as a Duchess look-a-like.

She said: 'I thought it would last a year after the wedding, but she is becoming more popular which will continue with the royal baby too.

'Maybe in 20 years I will still be doing it.

'But it depends on my appearance and if I age at the same rate.

'It is not a bad thing looking like her though.

'It could be worse.'
