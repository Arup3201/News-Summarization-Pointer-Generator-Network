The tension was palpable in Thursday’s drivers’ press conference as Formula One's title contenders’ Lewis Hamilton and Nico Rosberg came face-to-face in Abu Dhabi.

Heading into the season finale, Hamilton holds a 17-point lead over his Mercedes team-mate. A second-placed finish will secure the championship.

In contrast, it is likely that Rosberg must follow his victory in Brazil with another win in Abu Dhabi to stand any chance of claiming his maiden Formula One title.

And the German appeared to up the ante by  calling on Hamilton to avoid a collision in Sunday’s decider.

The McLaren driver then sported a sheepish grin after Rosberg's comments in Thursday's press conference 

‘Lewis can do something to keep it clean, which is to drive clean himself, so it’s not like he can’t do anything,’ the usually mild-mannered Rosberg said.

The German’s comments raised a few eyebrows in the room, not least from Jenson Button, whose comical reaction was caught on camera.

Button’s eyes visibly widened as Rosberg made the remark before the Briton then sported a sheepish grin. 

Button may have been taking part in his final pre-race press conference with his future very much hanging in the balance. 

The 2009 world champion is set to be replaced by Fernando Alonso, who will join McLaren after quitting Ferrari, with the team to announce who will partner him next month.
