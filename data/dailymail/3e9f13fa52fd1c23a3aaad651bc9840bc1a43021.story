Michael Gove has written to all schools and colleges in England warning them to watch out for signs of radicalisation and other forms of child abuse

Michael Gove has written to all schools and colleges in England urging them to watch out for signs of radicalisation in the wake of the so-called Trojan Horse plot.

In a letter to headteachers, the Education Secretary said schools and colleges must be aware of any type of child abuse.

He said this included radicalisation as well as cyberbullying, sexual exploitation and female genital mutilation.

The Department of Education advice included links to existing guidance from a variety of organisations. One of those was Channel - part of a government strategy to protect people at risk of being radicalised.

The information said those at risk might possess 'material or symbols associated with an
 extremist cause (e.g. the swastika for far right groups)'.

It added they 'spend 
increasing time in the company of other suspected extremists' or attempt
 to recruit others to their cause.

The advice suggests a change in appearance or clothing as well as a loss of interest in friends may also be clues of radicalisation.

The document said: 'Channel is about 
protecting people from radicalisation into all forms of terrorism, but 
the most significant threat to this country is from Al Qa’ida 
affiliated, influenced and associated groups.'

The advice comes as The National 
Association of Headteachers claimed schools across Britain have been 
targeted in the alleged Trojan Horse plot.

The plot involves the alleged ousting of headteachers, mainly in and around the Birmingham area, by Islamic extremists attempting to take over several top schools in a bid to target vulnerable young people.

The Park View School in Birmingham - which, according to whistleblowers, has been infiltrated by Islamic extremists who are attempting to change the school and target young people

Last
 week, association members said they had ‘serious concerns’ about attempts to 
‘alter the character’ of at least six schools  - before warning efforts had
 been made to infiltrate a number of classrooms across the country.

At least 20 schools are currently being investigated in wake of the claims.

The so-called Trojan Horse plot first came to light earlier this year.

Department for Education inspectors were ordered into Park View School in Birmingham along with its sister schools, Golden Hillock and Nansen, after a letter dubbed 'Trojan Horse' was uncovered.

It allegedly outlined a plot by Muslim hardliners to drive moderate headteachers out of schools.

Whistleblowers at Park View have claimed the school is in the hands of a group of extremists who infiltrated the governing body.

It is alleged girls at the school were forced to sit at the back of the classroom and non-Muslim pupils forced to teach themselves at the state school.

The letter prompted separate ongoing investigations by both the Department for Education (DfE) and Ofsted in to the school and several others in the area.

The DfE has also appointed its own 
education commissioner, the former head of the Metropolitan Police’s 
counter-terrorism unit Peter Clarke for the investigation.

Following the allegations, the school was placed in to special measures. Another 21 are thought to be under investigation by schools watchdog Ofsted. Birmingham City Council is also investigating 25 schools.

Last week The National Association of Head Teachers said it had ‘serious concerns’ about attempts to ‘alter the character’ of at least six schools - warning the 'plot' was spreading across the country.

Two teachers in Bradford have since left their jobs - with a third claiming their are being forced out - in the latest twist to the story.

The Department for Education's newly updated advice said everyone working in a school or college should be aware of the signs of abuse and neglect 'so that they are able to identify cases of children who may be in need of help or protection' and can take action.

Today, Mr Gove wrote: 'The guidance reiterates that staff members working with 
children should always think ‘it could happen here’ where safeguarding 
is concerned.

'School and 
college staff are particularly important as they are in a position to 
identify concerns early and provide help for children, to prevent 
concerns from escalating.'

In a specific section on female genital mutilation (FGM) it said that all professionals needed to be 'alert to the possibility of a girl being at risk of FGM, or already having suffered FGM'.

It added that girls at risk of the practice may not know they were in danger.

The so-called 'Trojan Horse’ plot is the alleged takeover in secular schools by Muslim extremists.

Some claim they are attempting to infiltrate state schools and run them according to Islamic principles.

One of the most high-profile schools involved in the claims, Park View Academy in Birmingham, has been condemned for increasing ‘Islamisation’.

It is claimed the school has hosted extremist preachers during assemblies and encouraged girls to cover their hair.

The school was recently subject to an emergency investigation by schools watchdog Ofsted and was put in to special measures.

At the end of last month, a list of 18 schools  under investigation in and around Birmingham was released.

Last week, Ofsted announced inspections were investigating a further three schools, bringing the total to 21.
