The parents of two young children who were allegedly stabbed to death by their nanny in their Upper West Side apartment last year have revealed they are expecting a baby boy.

Marina and Kevin Krim shared the happy news on a Facebook page set up in the memory of their two slain children, two-year-old Leo and six-year-old Lulu.

The baby boy will join the Krims' surviving daughter, four-year-old Nessie, and will be born almost a year after the horrific murders last October.

Happy news: Marina and Kevin Krim, whose son and daughter were allegedly stabbed to death by their nanny last year, have revealed that they are expecting a baby boy this fall

'Hello everyone, We are very happy to let you know that Marina is expecting a baby in the fall,' read the message on the Lulu & Leo Fund.

'Nessie canâ€™t wait to welcome her new baby brother. We are filled with many emotions as we look to the future, but the most important one is hope. We are very grateful to you all for your amazing support.'

The message has already received more than 2,000 'likes'.

Leo and Lulu, whose full name was Lucia, were murdered at the family's Upper West Side home on October 26 in an horrific crime that shocked the country.

Mrs Krim arrived home at the family apartment to find two of her two children dead in the bath-tub next to nanny Yoselyn Ortega who had slit her own throat in an alleged suicide attempt.

Loss: Two-year-old Leo and his big sister Lulu, six, were found in a pool of blood in the family's home

Victims: Only Nessie, whose picture has been pixelated, escaped harm as she was with her mother

Nessie escaped injury as she was with her mother at the time.

In January, Mr Krim, an executive at America's CNBC television station, said that they are drawing strength from their remaining child.

He said: 'Marina and I couldn't be more proud of her - she is very smart, beautiful and tough. And she's grown so much over the past two months. She saves us every day.'

In April, the Krim's nanny Yoseyln Ortega, 50, was
ruled fit to stand trial and will now face a jury for two counts of 
first-degree murder and two counts of second-degree murder.

Cause for celebration: The Krims shared the happy news on a Facebook page set up for the children

She has pleaded not guilty to the charges.

When questioned by police after awaking from the coma, the nanny attempted to paint Mrs Krim in a bad light, shifting part of the blame for the tragedy on her.

Ortega, who had told neighbors and family that she was short of money, revealed she resented her employers because they kept telling her what to do and asked her to do the housework, it was reported after the murders.
