A young couple are believed to have died of carbon monoxide poisoning after parking their car in a garage for some 'hanky panky', it was revealed today.

The bodies of Melissa Pereira, 25, and Jorge Rodriguez, 24, were found on Sunday, three weeks after they mysteriously disappeared on their way to a romantic break to celebrate their anniversary at a Pennsylvania bed and breakfast on December 27.

On the day they were last seen Melissa and Jorge stocked up on Campbell’s soup at Kmart and ate at Burger King before they went out for the late night drive, family members said.

Jorge Rodriguez, 24, and his girlfriend Melissa Pereira, 25, were last seen leaving her home in Wayne, New Jersey, on Dec. 27

Grisly find: The couple are believed to have become overwhelmed by carbon monoxide fumes inside this garage. When they were found the car's gas tank empty and the battery was dead

A giddy Melissa Pereira even tweeted affectionately about their upcoming trip on the day they disappeared. ‘Weekend with my everything :) #lovehim’. It would be her final tweet.

But they never checked into their hotel. 
They had vanished. But there was no reason to suspect they eloped, they 
were not in trouble and neither was their any reason why they would be 
driven to suicide.

‘They had plans to go on the trip,’ Pereira’s uncle Sham Bacchus told MailOnline. ‘This is too much, she and Jorge had their whole lives ahead of them.’

Then on Sunday, detectives descended on garage number 55 inside the Wayne Village Apartment complex in New Jersey.

Inside the 10-by-12-foot structure were the lovers’ lifeless bodies slumped over the front seats of Rodrigeuz’s white Honda Prelude, the gas tank empty, the battery dead.

Bacchus, 45, told MailOnline he suspects the couple retreated to the garage for a little fun.

‘They’re kids,’ he said. ‘They might have wanted some quiet time together’, but added that when their bodies were found 'they had their clothes on'.

There they they may have become 
overwhelmed by odorless carbon monoxide fumes after turning on the car 
to keep warm with the garage door shut.

All of Pereira’s personal items were left at home, Bacchus said, and he added that they had ‘their clothes on.’ 

‘This has to be an accident,' he said.

Nicole Trifari, a neighbor living in the complex who was the last person to see the couple alive as they shut the garage door, told MailOnline how she is haunted by that last interaction.

Trifari, 24, was outside her apartment sipping coffee while her boyfriend smoked a cigarette just before midnight on December 27.

She said Rodriguez and Pereira pulled-up and idled in the parking lot for several minutes.

Then Rodriguez, who was behind the wheel, hopped out of the car and tried to use a key to open a garage door.

When that failed Trifari and her boyfriend became suspicious.

‘We thought he was trying to break in,’ she said.

Afterward, Rodriguez used the same key to unlock garage number 55.

The couple had been dating for about two years and were said to be very happy and excited for the future

‘He gets back in the car and that’s when the girl looks over at me,’ Trifari said. ‘She smiled. She acknowledged us and we acknowledged her. They back in and he got out and closed the garage.’

While Trifari thought the late-night rendezvous in a grungy garage was ‘strange’ she also suspected the couple wanted privacy.

‘I thought they were going in there to have a little hanky-panky,’ she said. ‘I thought they’re doing whatever they’re doing and I wasn’t about to go and knock on the door.’

Trifari and her boyfriend decided to turn in for the night she said they ‘never thought about it again.’

On Sunday Trifari awoke to a phalanx of cops outside her doorstep and watched two bodies being plucked from the Honda get placed into a van.

‘I see the front end of the car and I told my boyfriend, “You’ve got to be kidding me. They’ve been missing the whole time?”’

Melissa and Jorge met as portrait photographers at a JC Penny, Bacchus said.

Pereira worked at Fox News as a technical editor, her uncle said, before returning to school.

She split time as a photographer at JC Penny and worked in the technology department at the Boys and Girls Club.

‘They
 had a very loving relationship,’ Bacchus said. ‘Jorge spent more time 
at her house than he did at his own house. There were conversations 
about getting married in the future, yes.'

Michael
 DeMarco, chief assistant with the Passaic County Prosecutor's Office 
told MailOnline when they made the grim discovery there wasn’t a suicide
 note found and no outward signs of trauma detected.

Intimate: A neighbor who saw them enter the garage at first thought they were burglars but told MailOnline she soon realized they were probably going in there for 'hanky panky'. Melissa posted this picture of the couple on Twitter

‘These are kids who were in love. Something happened and we’re trying to piece together what it was.’

Family members of Rodriguez said that suicide ‘wasn’t an option.’

‘It’s a horrible accident,’ one relative who requested anonymity told MailOnline. ‘They’re a loving couple and they would not kill themselves.’

Neither Jorge or Melissa canceled their $195 per night reservation to the Cherry Valley Manor Bed and Breakfast in Stroudsburg, Pennsylvania.

But when the couple were no-shows, innkeeper Julia Manovscaia said Melissa's mother Bibi called asking for her daughter.

Manovscaia reimbursed the money Melissa put down for the two nights to her mother.  

But Bacchus also expressed concern over why it took so long to find the couple. 

Bacchus, a school principal, said he physically went over to the garage after noticing the one and only key was missing.

‘I went to the garage and banged on that garage on Monday night after we filed the police report.’

He said he informed cops about the storage garage when his family filed the missing report on December 30.

‘We told them about the garage,’ he said. ‘Sometimes you wonder if full attention was given – those types of things you wonder.

‘But as a public servant myself I want to give everyone the benefit of the doubt.’

Michael DeMarco, of the Possaic County Prosecutor's Office, claims cops never sat on the garage as a possible lead.

‘When
 detectives became aware that there was a garage owned by the family 
they followed it up and lo and behold they were inside the garage.’

So in love: Family and friends say there is no reason the couple may have wanted to take their own lives. They were looking forward to their anniversary and had a bright future together

Bacchus also has concerns that Melissa was found in possession of her iPhone.

‘That’s the craziest thing that Melissa’s cell phone was still active,’ he said. ‘We asked the cops to track her cell phone and since there were two police departments involved I don’t think there was enough evidence for them to issue it.’

Whatever the holdups with the investigation, Bacchus says the family is mourning.

Jorge will be buried on Sunday and Melissa's funeral will take place Monday.

‘What has happened, happened,’ he said through tears. ‘I can’t bring my niece back. I feel extremely sorry for my sister because she has to bury her child.

‘Melissa and Jorge were her life. I can’t explain it in words.’
