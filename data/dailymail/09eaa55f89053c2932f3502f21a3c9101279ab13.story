The Prince of Wales has claimed the devastating typhoon that hit the  Philippines is a ‘direct result’ of climate change.

Typhoon Haiyan claimed at least 4,000 lives, while  4million people have been forced to leave their homes since the storm struck almost two weeks ago.

During a speech at the Royal Society in London, Charles said: ‘The devastating impact of Typhoon Haiyan in the Philippines should surely have been a poignant and telling reminder of the intimacy and interdependence of man’s relationship with the natural world.

Warning: Charles was speaking today at a meeting on tropical forests and climate change, attended by business leaders and forestry experts, at the Royal Society in Central London

‘The frequency and intensity of 
extreme weather events has increased, and is set further to increase, in
 many parts of the world, as a direct result of anthropogenic climate 
change.’

Charles added that the ‘facts and the science are clear and inescapable’.

The
 event, attended by business leaders and forestry experts, launched the 
annual report by the Carbon Disclosure Project – an international 
not-for-profit organisation – into corporate attempts to reduce the risk
 of supply chains causing deforestation.

Paul
 Simpson, chief executive of CDP, said: ‘This is the first time we have 
had a joint event with Prince Charles. He is very knowledgeable about 
this area, probably more than any of the politicians in our government.’

Matt
 Sexton, director of corporate and social responsibility at B&Q, 
said: ‘Prince Charles told me that 20 years ago he met our chief 
executive and challenged him to make our timber supply chain more 
sustainable.

‘I told Prince Charles that we had met his challenge.

‘He
 said it was terrific that B&Q are no longer causing deforestation, 
but asked what we are doing about reforestation. It is nice to be set a 
new challenge just when you have met the old one.’

Justin
 Mundy, director of Charles’s charities’ International Sustainability 
Unit (ISU) praised the Prince’s ‘determination for practical action on 
the ground’.

Gavin Neath, 
co-chairman of the ISU’s working group on public-private partnerships to
 reduce deforestation, said: ‘It is vital that we don’t make the same 
mistake in Africa in the next decade that we made in South East Asia in 
the last two.’

Andrew Mitchell, founder and director of the tropical 
forest think tank Global Canopy  Programme, said: ‘Agriculture is the 
big Sumo wrestler of deforestation and climate change.

‘We have to engage with the agricultural sector in stopping deforestation.’

But
 Conservative MP Peter Lilley said Prince Charles should ‘have got his 
facts right’ before speaking publicly about climate change.

The
 MP for Hitchin and Harpenden said: ‘For us to deduce that Typhoon 
Haiyan was anything to do with global warming we would have to show that
 it’s part of a trend towards more numerous or more powerful typhoons.

‘There
 hasn’t been such a trend. Even the IPCC [Intergovernmental Panel on 
Climate Change] has very low confidence there has been any trend in the 
number or intensity of typhoons.’

Mr Lilley added: ‘I don’t mind him wading in on issues but he should have got his facts right.’

A
 spokesman from the Department of Energy and Climate Change said: ‘We 
cannot currently say whether Haiyan was or was not affected by climate 
change.

‘But scientific 
evidence shows that extreme weather events are most certainly 
intensifying and this is expected to continue as global warming 
proceeds.’

Following Hurricane Sandy in 2012, scientists warned that extreme weather events would increase if global warming continued at its current rate and these warnings have been echoed in Prince Charles’ address today. 

Global warming is attributed to rising sea levels as the increase in temperatures causes the ice caps to melt.  As sea levels rise, the chances of storm surges increase.

A surge is an abnormal rise of water produced by a storm, caused by strong onshore winds and a drop in atmospheric pressure. These storms go hand-in-hand with tropical cyclones, hurricanes and typhoons. 

The rising levels also increase the chances of flooding associated with hurricanes and other extreme weather events. 

Elsewhere, global warming is said to have increased the amount of rainfall across the globe because the rising temperatures increase the amount of moisture in the air. This is similarly associated with extreme weather events. 

As the Earth’s temperature rises, the seas become warmer.

Atlantic sea surface temperatures (SSTs) have risen by 0.5°C over the past decade and this trend is set to continue. 

Hurricane expert Kerry Emanuel first suggested in the late 80s that an increase in SSTs would cause stronger hurricanes and this threat is increased in areas where the sea temperatures are above 25°C. 

However, the effect man-made climate change is having on global warming has not been categorically proved. 

Although scientists don’t deny global warming is causing the rise in extreme weather events, how much of this is down to man-made events is said to be ‘inconclusive.’
