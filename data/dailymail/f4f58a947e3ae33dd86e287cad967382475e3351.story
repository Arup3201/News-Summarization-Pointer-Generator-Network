'Speak out': Ronald Lauder - the billionaire son of Estee Lauder - told a congressional committee in Washington that American must take the lead

European Jews are living in fear 'like the 1930s', the World Jewish Congress leader has warned as he called on the U.S. to speak out against the rise of anti-Semitism across the continent.

Ronald Lauder - the billionaire son of Estee Lauder -  told a congressional committee in Washington that America must take the lead against the surge in anti-Semitic incidents in Europe in order to 'defeat the new flame of Islamic terror'.

He pointed to the strong line taken by European leaders in the wake of attacks like those seen in Paris, Toulouse and Copenhagen earlier this year, and urged the U.S. to follow in their footsteps. 

'Once again, like the 1930s, European Jews live in fear,' said Lauder.

'The United States can and must speak loudly and clearly to condemn this evil for what it is - the radical Islamic hatred of Jews.' 

Mr Lauder, who has led the World Jewish Congress since 2007, pointed to the fact Jews make up just one per cent of France's population, yet were victim to half the country's racist attacks.

He also noted that anti-Semitic attacks have not only doubled in France in the past year, but also in the UK and Austria.

He stressed: 'To defeat this new flame of radical Islamic terror and survive... the United States must lead.' 

Mr Lauder also revealed a recent meeting with Jewish leaders in Rome had revealed they believed the Italian capital would have no Jewish community within 25 years.

According to Forbes, Mr Lauder claimed they say their children and grandchildren will look for more welcoming countries in which to make their homes in in the future.

'There is a hatred growing throughout Europe that is causing Jews to wonder if they should leave. They are asking if there is a future for Jews on that continent,' he told the committee.

Mr Lauder was joined by two other members of the WJC, which represents Jewish communities in 100 countries, who echoed his fears.

Dan Asmussen, a Danish Jewish leader, noted Danish society 'itself is not and has never been anti-Semitic and many of the threats facing Danish Jewry - like in the rest of Europe - come from marginalized and radicalized Muslims, and these form a small minority of all Muslims in Denmark.'

Roger Cukierman, a French Jewish leader, added: 'This is a war against Western modern civilization. And the Jews are seen by these Jihadists as a privileged target.

'We Jews are the sentinels at the forefront of this war. But we are not the only victims. 

'Military forces, policemen and women, journalists were also targeted and killed.'
