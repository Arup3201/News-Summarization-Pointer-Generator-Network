As an English country manor in the centre of Washington, it has been at the heart of diplomatic relations between Britain and the U.S. since the 1920s.

For 80 years a visit to the grand, sweeping ballroom of the British ambassador's residence has become the ultimate statement of power and style.

Yards from the official residence of the Vice President, the building has played host to figures from Winston Churchill and Margaret Thatcher to Elizabeth Taylor and the Beatles.

Now the building - the only one in North America by Sir Edwin Lutyens, who designed the Cenotaph in London's Whitehall and the Midland Bank building in Manchester - has been paid lavish tribute in the first book of its kind.

In his study The Architecture of Diplomacy, renowned historian Dr Anthony Seldon tells how the building became a haunt of both nations' brokers of power and popular culture over 80 years.

King George VI sipped tea on the terrace with the banker JP Morgan just months before the outbreak of the Second World War, which would cement a permanent alliance between the two nations.

Months after the war broke out, he hosted a garden party for 5,000 people which saw a ferocious scramble for tickets and helped to secure America's loyalty in what has been known ever since as the 'special relationship' between the U.S. and Britain.

Margaret Thatcher held two dinners in the ballroom for President Reagan, as their world view brought them together in the closest 'special relationship' until the controversial one between George Bush and Tony Blair.

The palatial home has remained a powerful symbol of Anglo-American relations despite the original complex becoming too small for the administrative side of the embassy, which moved to a purpose-built centre next-door in the late 1950s.

But it was not just a place for British leaders to hold court. Americans took it on as their own too, including Hillary Clinton, who hosted her last dinner as Secretary of State inside its grandiose rooms.

Prime location: The embassy is a stone's throw from the official residence of the Vice President

A redbrick palace with an entrance 
like one of a museum, the residence was deliberately designed in the 
style of Georgian country manor.

It was the first of many diplomatic centres in the road now described as Embassy Row, stretching almost from the White House to the United States Naval Observatory.

Set back from the street, it has eight acres of rose gardens, lawns and greenhouses, presided over by a statue of Winston Churchill clutching his trademark cigar.

It does have American touches: Lutyens used Indiana limestone and Pennsylvania bricks to show partnership with the U.S., and its enormous scale is a tribute to American style.

Those lucky enough to be invited as guests are presided over by an attentive staff, who serve tea in immaculate Royal Doulton china.

The building has not always been so popular, however.

In his new book Dr Seldon, the headmaster of the famed private school Wellington College, reveals how its first residents bombarded the renowned architect with complaints, partly about the gigantic portico over its entrance.

Grand: The ambassador's residence was built like a Georgian manor on a vast scale in the heart of the capital

Leafy: The home is set in eight acres of gardens and is round the corner from the Vice President's residence

Now infamous, the phrase was coined by none other 
than Sir Winston Churchill, who gave a speech in the U.S. in the 
aftermath of the Second World War.

Standing before a crowd in Fulton, Missouri, in 1946, he called for 'a special relationship 
between the British Commonwealth and Empire and the United States', who 
can 'work together at the common task as friends and partners'.

Since then the message of the speech, which also coined the phrase 'Iron Curtain', has more or less been taken for granted.

It
 resurged particularly strongly in the 1980s, when Margaret Thatcher and
 Ronald Reagan shared a political view of the world and a strong desire 
to end the Cold War.

But it has, of course, been strained in the past.

When
 Harold Wilson refused to send British troops into Vietnam, the 
relationship between the two nations was weakened, though it never 
broke to due British backbenchers emphasising their support.

And when Tony 
Blair co-operated with President Bush to send troops into Iraq, the 
nature of the relationship took on a new, sinister significance for 
millions.

Sir Esme Howard, the famed British ambassador to Washington of the 1920s, complained that the dark, imposing doorway 'resembles the entrance to a Tube station or a mortuary chapel', The Times reported.

His successor's wife, meanwhile, complained in 1930 that the newly-opened residence was 'overrun' with rats.

But despite initial grumblings, the grand home has become a nationally-registered historic building in the U.S. and a cornerstone of what has been termed the 'special relationship'.

In a speech to journalists to celebrate the book's release, British ambassador to Washington Sir Peter Westmacott said the building was still something 'really rather special'.

'The reason why this book has been produced is because for [my wife] Susie and me it is such an enormous privilege to live in this extraordinary house.

'Here we were at a time when the British government decided that it needed to make a bold statement about its relationship with Washington and America, recruiting probably the best-known of the British architects at the time to make a very brave and deliberate statement about the relationship.

'Here we are with a house which is built for purpose.

'Iit's not like most of the other great embassies, of which there are a number in this city, which were houses built by someone else for their own purposes and then bought by government.

'It has lots of space and a design which allows us to have lots of people in here.'
