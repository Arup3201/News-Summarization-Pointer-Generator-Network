Crystal Palace manager Alan Pardew has had his players training at Selhurst Park in the hope of exploiting a set-piece advantage over Queens Park Rangers in Saturday's lunchtime kick-off.

Palace’s home form this season is the second worst in the Barclays Premier League, with bottom-side Leicester City the only club worse than them on home turf.

The Selhurst Park pitch has been re-laid twice this season, and with Pardew admitting the surface ‘isn’t perfect’, he has called his players into the stadium that they face QPR in on Saturday to practice their dead-ball routines.

‘Our home form is something that we’re focusing on,’ Pardew said. ‘Really, we’ve done enough to stay in the division away from home already but our home form doesn’t reflect what it should be.

‘Our stadium needs to be rocking tomorrow and if we want to keep it where it is in terms of that support, you’ve got to give them wins.

‘We’re a good set-play team so we’ve been getting used to the co-ordinates here and the environment to make sure our set-plays are on the money tomorrow.

‘This new pitch is good, but it’s not perfect. The Premier League pitches don’t really get relaid during the season, they’re perfect, so it’s very unusual for us to have to do that. I can’t say it’s as good as Arsenal’s, Swansea’s or Newcastle’s, because it isn’t.’

And Pardew sees Palace’s game against QPR as being more important for the visitors than his side, even though he admits both are still in a relegation scrap.

‘It’s an important game,’ he said. ‘Probably more important for QPR than us, with where they are, those three teams down the bottom (QPR, Burnley and Leicester) really need a quick win to get them in touch again so it’s a huge game for them – probably must-win.

The Selhurst Park pitch has been relaid twice this season, and is not as impressive as other top flight clubs

‘For us, we just need to make sure we pick up points or pick up wins when we can and we’ll be ok. We have a cushion at the moment but it can be easily eroded with a defeat tomorrow so we need to make sure that we’re on our metal.’

Palace, with 30 points, are currently eight points clear of third-bottom QPR but Pardew still believes it will require a further 10 before his side are sure of staying up.
