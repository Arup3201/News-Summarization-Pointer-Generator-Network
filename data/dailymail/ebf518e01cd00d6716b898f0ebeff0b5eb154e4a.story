for their high calorie counts.

The company's PB&C Shake (peanut butter and chocolate) has a whopping 2,010 calories and 69g of saturated fat.

The shake was exposed in 2011 after being named by the Center for Science in the Public Interest (CSPI) to highlight high fat products to protect consumers.

The PB&C shake is no longer on the company's website but the highest calorie shake on their current menu is the Oh Fudge! Shake which boasts 1360 calories and 78g of total fat for the 20oz serving.
