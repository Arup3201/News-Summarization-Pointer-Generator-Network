A new companion of disgraced NBA owner Donald Sterling has been revealed to be the 'BFF for life' of his former mistress, V. Stiviano.

Raquel Lee is a self-proclaimed 'mother, model, actress, designer and entrepreneur.' She claims tangential connections to several celebrities - including that Rob Kardashian once babysat her nephew and that she worked as a 'red carpet designer' for Destiny Child's Michelle Williams and reality starlet Tila Tequila.

She was pictured earlier this month as one of four new girlfriends who 80-year-old Sterling took with him on vacation to Desert Springs, California, Radar Online claims.

New boo? Raquel Lee posted several photos from the same resort where Donald Sterling was pictured earlier this month

'BFF for life: In October, V. Stiviano and Miss Lee shared a smooch and these loving remarks at a birthday party that Sterling threw for Stiviano

She posted several pictures on Instagram from the places where Sterling was spotted - but made no mention of being with the elderly NBA owner. 

She did not respond to a request for comment from MailOnline on Wednesday.

Sterling cut ties with Stiviano after she released recordings of him making racist comments. Those recordings resulted in international outcry and the NBA banning him from the league for life.

Sterling, a billionaire real estate mogul, has also been forced to sell his NBA franchise, the Los Angeles Clippers, for $2billion.

Sterling has vehemently denied claims that he's racist. It's thought he was trying to prove a point when he checked into the JW Marriott resort in Palm Desert, California with two women who appeared to be black, including Miss Lee, and two who appeared to be Asian two weeks ago.

Miss Lee claims she 'created red carpet designs' for Michelle Williams of Destiny's Child and reality star Tila Tequila

His longtime wife, Shelly Sterling, was nowhere to be seen. Neither was Stiviano.

Miss Lee's new billionaire friend, Sterling, might have come at the expense of an old one - Stiviano.

On her Instagram page Miss Lee has posted several pictures of her and 31-year-old Stiviano together - including one red carpet snap in October 2013 in which she writes 'Happy bday #bf (V. Stiviano) love you!'

Stiviano replies, 'my BFF for life...'

On social media, Miss Lee seems to make it a point to brush up against celebrity. In March, she posted a 'throwback Thursday' photo of her and reality star Rob Kardashian.

'#RobbieK he's so nice, he kept my nephew for me one day. And he loved him!' she wrote.

In a short 'Beauty of the Week' profile in Jet magazine, she claimed that she 'created Red Carpet designs for Megan Good, Michelle Williams (of Destiny’s Child), and Tila Tequila to name a few,' according to Radar.

Moving on? Stiviano was pictured out last week at the State of Ferrari even in Los Angeles with an older male friend
