Andy Murray was delighted to welcome a third British male entrant into the Australian Open singles when Kyle Edmund came through the qualifying event to make the main draw.

Murray, 27, is increasingly taking on a mentoring role when it comes to his younger compatriots but when the main action begins he will need to focus exclusively on himself.

And according to former British No 1 Greg Rusedski, who had a spell coaching Yorkshire’s Edmund last year, the stakes could hardly be higher this season for the Scot.

Greg Rusedski believes Andy Murray will need to display attacking intent in order to win a major in 2015

‘This year will be the defining year for Andy. I think 2015 will tell us if he will ever win a major again,’ said Rusedski, who described the scheduled run here of Murray facing Grigor Dimitrov in the fourth round and Roger Federer in the quarter-finals as a ‘brutal draw’.

While believing he can negotiate it, Rusedski — commentating for Eurosport on the event — believes he will need to display attacking intent all the way. ‘If he’s going to come out and win this tournament, he needs to be aggressive on the second serve, take on the forehand when it’s there to be hit and use the backhand up the line.

‘If he does those things he has a real shot. Andy has an incredible sense of what he needs to do at the big moments in the big matches, which is so important. Amelie Mauresmo [his coach] would have had all of the off-season to work on the areas of Murray’s game that needed working on and physically he looks very, very well.

The Scot has taken to mentoring young British talent but Greg Rusedski says he must focus on himself

‘His performance in Abu Dhabi [earlier this month], where he absolutely destroyed Rafael Nadal in two sets, was the best I’ve seen him play in a long time and he played well in the Hopman Cup, too. It’s a good opportunity to see where Andy really is at the moment.’

Murray certainly looks primed for a decent run at a tournament where his record is admirably consistent. Prior to his quarter-final loss 12 months ago to Roger Federer, not long after returning from back surgery, he had reached three finals and a semi-final in four years.

He will kick off his campaign on the opening day of the tournament — the early hours of Monday morning UK time — with a match on the newly enhanced Margaret Court Arena, which now has a sliding roof and can house 7,500 spectators. His opponent will be Indian qualifier Yuki Bhambri, 22, the world No 314, who has a nice feel for the ball and won the junior Australian Open six years ago.

He will have nothing to lose after coming through three preliminary rounds and the same can be said of Edmund, who won his final eliminator on Saturday with a gutsy 6-7, 6-4, 9-7 win over Dane Propoggia in two hours and 23 minutes.

Him making the main draw by right just a week after his 20th birthday gave something of a feelgood factor to the British game, with Heather Watson winning the women’s title in Hobart.

The only disappointment was that Liam Broady could not join them in the main draw, falling 7-5, 6-3 to the 36-year-old Michael Russell.

Like James Ward, who will face Fernando Verdasco on Tuesday, Edmund was a visitor to Murray’s December training camp in Miami and managed to impress his host.

The 27-year-old is tipped for a decent run in Melbourne where his record is admirably consistent

‘Kyle has a good attitude, very calm with his feet on the ground,’ said Murray. ‘Liam got to the last round, Heather has won and my brother and Jonny Marray both won doubles events last week. It would be nice to have a good year for all the British players. I’m pleased for Kyle and it’s good to see Liam doing well. They both work very hard and, when you see someone putting in the effort, it’s nice to see them get the rewards.’

Edmund has long been identified as the leading British prospect of his generation but, as with most players trying to make the transition to the top level, progress has not been entirely smooth.

Last year he finished with his long-time coach Colin Beecher and then had two mentors in Rusedski and James Trotman before opting to go with the latter full-time.

He won a Challenger level event in Japan late last season and now his renewed progression will get a good test from world No 39 Steve Johnson, the Californian who enjoyed a breakthrough season in 2014.

Against local hope Propoggia, the fair-skinned Edmund’s phlegmatic temperament was stretched by the home crowd, who repeatedly suggested that he needed to get the sunscreen out in the heat.

Edmund said: ‘I wasn’t playing 10 out of 10 tennis but I needed to be a 10 out of 10 competitor.’
