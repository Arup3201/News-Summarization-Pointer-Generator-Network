The sun was shining and the ensembles colourful, as racegoers, joined by a glamorous Zara Phillips, arrived for Ladies Day at the Glorious Goodwood race meeting in Sussex today.

But for once, all eyes weren't on the brightly dressed ladies - all thanks to an unexpected appearance from Hollywood star Tom Cruise who arrived with Charles Gordon-Lennox, Earl of March and Kinrara, and his wife, Janet.

Zara, meanwhile, slipped into the racecourse with a minimum of fuss, although not before impressing fashion fans with her chic cream dress and matching cocktail hat, and was later seen enjoying a chat with the actor from the comfort of a box.

New hobby? Although not known for his love of racing, Cruise appeared to be enjoying the experience and had Zara on hand to pass on a few tips

Enjoying
 herself: Zara was spotted enjoying the sunshine as she watched the 
first race of the day, a huge pair of sunglasses firmly in place

Stylish: Zara was joined by a friend for her day at the races but husband Mike Tindall, 36, and baby Mia Grace both stayed at home

Looking good: Zara showed off her stylish side in a cream dress and black patent shoes as she took a day off from preparations for the World Equestrian Games

Beaming broadly at other racing fans, the Olympic silver medallist, 32, appeared to be on top form as she arrived with a friend for a rare day off from the intense training schedule she is following ahead of World Equestrian Games in Normandy next month.

Earlier this month, Zara took to the field at the Barbury Horse Trials near Marlborough and also enjoyed a successful day at the Salperton Park Horse Trials in Gloucestershire in late June.

But successful though most of her outings have been, it is the World Equestrian Games that are at the front of her mind, particularly as Team GB selectors for Rio 2016 will be in the crowd.

Competing alongside Zara in Normandy will be the rest of the current Team GB, among them world number one William Fox-Pitt and fellow Olympic medallist Tina Cook.

Despite the prospect of an imminent brush with the selectors, Zara looked relaxed and ready to enjoy a day's racing which kicked off with the Fairmont Stakes, which was won by three-year-old colt Lyn Valley.

Enjoying
 himself: Tom Cruise certainly appeared impressed with his experiences 
of the quintessentially British event and was seen laughing with Lord 
March

impressed with his horse's performance

Oh no! Lily Atkinson, daughter of Rowan, looks grim as she watches the races with Charles Henry Gordon-Lennox, Lord Settrington - the son and heir of Lord March

Although neither Tom Cruise nor Zara Phillips managed to back him, TV star Carole Vorderman, who was chic in a demure navy blue jumpsuit, was left celebrating her first win of the day.

Also left less than impressed was the Queen, whose Gold Cup winning filly Estimate was left to bring up the rear in the Artemis Goodwood Cup - much to her jockey Ryan Moore's distress.

Estimate, who was recently caught up in a doping scandal that led to her being accidentally fed morphine-tainted feed, was left far behind the eventual winner, Sheikh Mohammed bin Rashid Al Maktoum's horse Cavalryman.

Off the course, things hotted up in the style stakes too, with racegoers plumping for demure shift dresses and eye-catching hats of the type that wouldn't look out of place at Royal Ascot.

Although it doesn't quite hit the sartorial heights of the Berkshire meet, Glorious Goodwood is 
catching up in the fashion stakes as more and more racegoers take the 
opportunity to dress up for the occasion.

Like Ascot, Goodwood operates a strict dress code 
that outlaws jeans and shorts and insists that guests keep their 
shoulders covered and eschew fancy dress.

Instead,
 the style guide suggests 'jackets and either ties, cravats or polo neck
 sweaters' for gentlemen and 'smart casual' for ladies, adding that 'due
 to the terrain and areas of decking at Goodwood, flat shoes are 
recommended'.

Fashionable: A racing fan shows off her chic fuchsia fedora teamed with a simple white dress (left) while racegoer Grey Cooper demonstrates how to do summer florals

Pretty: Delicate shades of nude and cream proved especially popular with racegoers, who added interest using crystal and feather details

Final
 touches: A group of racegoers put the finishing touches to their 
ensembles, with delicate floral corsages proving particularly popular

Floor sweeping: Several racegoers plumped for unusually long gowns, including one that looked like a wedding dress (left), while others picked flowing and summery

While Cheltenham is famous for pearls and fur, and Aintree for its colourfully dressed fillies in fake tan and skyscraper heels, Glorious Goodwood's trademark is low key luxury - and flat shoes.

Delicate bejewelled sandals are the most popular with racegoers, as are Sloaney ballet pumps and in the case of some hardened souls, comfortable loafers and deck shoes.

Nevertheless, the meeting isn't short of glamour with plenty of the big, bold, be-plumed hats of the sort seen at Berkshire's Royal Ascot and neat, nipped-in shift dresses reigning supreme in the paddock.

As at Ascot, racegoers have a strict dress code to contend with which insists on smart-casual in all areas and outlaws bare shoulders and any sort of fancy dress.

'Goodwood is famous for being a stylish 
yet relaxed occasion,' continues the style guide, 'and gentlemen are required to wear jackets and 
either ties, cravats or polo neck sweaters in the Richmond Enclosure.

'Linen suits and Panama Hats are traditionally worn by gentlemen. Jeans 
and shorts are not permitted in the Richmond Enclosure. In other 
enclosures dress is smart casual.

'Bare shoulder tops and fancy dress are not 
allowed in any enclosure. Due to the terrain and areas of decking at 
Goodwood flat shoes are recommended.'
