Payday lenders are to be banned from repeatedly raiding customers’ bank accounts to fund their debts under new powers to protect the poorest families.

Compulsory checks will also have to be carried out to make sure people can afford to repay loans before they are offered.

The new Financial Conduct Authority vowed to crackdown on any firm ‘overstepping the line’ by ripping off customers.

Payday lenders will also have to provide financial health warnings online and link to free debt help from April.

And the FCA is to consult on capping the total cost of a loan, to stop charges spiralling out of control.

Martin Wheatley, the FCA's chief executive, said: ‘Millions of consumers access some form of credit each day, from paying for everyday goods by credit to taking out a payday loan. We want to be sure that the market works well when people need it - whether that's for one day, one month or longer.

‘Our new rules will help us to protect consumers and give us strong new powers to tackle any firm found to be overstepping the line.’

WONGA Typical APR 5853%

Signed a four-year deal to sponsor Newcastle United. This
 month hired a Bafta-nominated director to produce a film on the 
controversial company to counteract criticism about its huge profits and
 sky-high interest rates.

CASH LADY Typical APR 2670%

Courted controversy when it hired ex-bankrupt reality star Kerry Katona to front ad campaign.  But last year the Atomic Kitten star declared herself bankrupt for the 
second time in five years due to unpaid debts. Her money troubles led to
 her being dropped as the face of Cash Lady.

PAYDAY UK Typical APR 2610%

Bought by US giant Dollar Financial in 2011 for a reported $195million. It is now part of the same firm which owns The Money Shop, which has 550 stores nationwide.

QUICK QUID Typical APR 1734%

Spent
 an estimated £3.2 million, advertising during programmes like Friends, 
Desperate Scousewives and Hollyoaks. In July it apologised after sending
 emails threatening to send in debt collectors to people who had not 
borrowed money.

Under the plans, a payday loan firm will 
be able to attempt to try raid a borrower's account using a recurring 
payment known as a continuous payment authority (CPA) twice.

The FCA will also have powers to ban any adverts by payday lenders which are found to be misleading.

Around 50,000 firms currently make up the £200 billion-a-year consumer credit market, which is currently overseen by the Office of Fair Trading (OFT). The FCA will take over in April.

Some payday firms were accused of basing their whole business model on people who would never be able to pay their loans back in time, meaning the original cost of the debt balloons and the borrower ends up rolling the loan over and sinking into deeper trouble.

Richard Lloyd, Which? executive director, said it was good to see the regulator taking on ‘firms that have been exploiting millions reliant on high cost credit to pay for essentials’.

He added: ‘Lenders should not wait for the new rules to take effect before changing their behaviour.

‘Borrowers must be treated fairly whatever form of credit they're using, so the regulator must clamp down on excessive fees and charges, particularly default fees charged by some payday lenders, to show it means business.’

The new financial health warnings will ensure customers are told: ‘Warning: Late repayment can cause you serious money problems. For help, go to moneyadviceservice.org.uk.’

The risk warnings will apply online from April and in print and on television from July.

Craig Gentle, PwC's consumer credit lead and financial services risk and regulation partner, said the new rules ‘set the scene for the biggest overhaul of the consumer credit industry in four decades’.

Joanna Elson, chief executive of debt charity the Money Advice Trust, said mandatory affordability checks have the potential to prevent much of the harm it sees. She added: ‘It is important these are rigorously enforced.’

Consumer campaigners said more still needs to be done to protect payday loan customers.

Wendy Alcock, campaigns manager at consumer help website MoneySavingExpert.com said: ‘Payday lenders have got away with too much for too long and the FCA must keep its word when it comes to cracking down on this broken market.

‘But this is not the end. We're still waiting for the total cost cap and our call for a ban on payday loan adverts from children's TV is yet to be answered by the Government or regulators.

‘Until all the problems with high-cost short-term credit are addressed, people need to look after their own pockets.’

Financial Secretary to the Treasury Sajid Javid welcomed the rules as another ‘milestone’ towards creating a stronger and safer financial services sector to support businesses and families.

He said: ‘A well functioning consumer credit market is key to this. That is why the Government has created the Financial Conduct Authority and provided it with the powers to act decisively to tackle bad practice and consumer detriment in areas like payday lending.’
