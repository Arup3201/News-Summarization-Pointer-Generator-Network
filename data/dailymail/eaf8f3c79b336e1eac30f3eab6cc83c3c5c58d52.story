A mental health patient was held in a police cell for almost two days because there were no beds available at nearby hospitals, it has emerged.

The patient is one of almost 200 people in Wiltshire held by the county's police force in the last two years because there was no suitable healthcare provision.

Meanwhile across the UK last year, 7,000 people with mental health problems ended up being held in police cells.

Of those, 236 children and young people were detained alongside criminals.

Mental health experts have branded the practice 'shameful', adding it highlights the fact there are not enough suitable crisis beds across the country.

A Freedom of Information request, submitted by the Swindon Advertiser, reveals the longest holding period in the last two years was 37.5 hours, while a 16-year-old was detained for eight consecutive hours.  

Ninety-four people were detained in Swindon and Wiltshire in 2013 and in 2014, the figure was 95. 

Condemning the practice, which is seen across the country, Mark Winstanley, chief executive of mental health charity, Rethink Mental Illness, told MailOnline the situation must change. 

'It's scandalous and shameful that thousands of people with mental health problems, including children, are being locked up in police cells because they can't get the care they need,' he said.

'That has to change, because it's costing lives.

'The real problem is that there simply aren't enough suitable crisis services across the country, and where they do exist, they are badly underfunded and overstretched. 

'We need much greater investment in crisis care, so that anyone experiencing mental health problems can get quality emergency support close to home, whenever they need it.

'We also want to see more funding for early intervention services, to help people avoid reaching crisis point in the first place.  

'Without this urgent reform and investment, the mental health system will continue to fail people when they are at their most vulnerable.' 

Dr Peter Carter, chief executive  of the Royal College of Nursing told MailOnline the practice is just one of the 'detrimental consequences' of severe cuts to mental health services. 

He said: 'Mental health trusts have had their budgets cut by eight per cent over the last five years, losing 1,500 beds and 3,300 nurses in the process. 

'Given these ongoing reductions in funding resources it is no wonder that trusts are struggling to cope. 

Across the UK last year, 7,000 people with mental health problems ended up being held in police cells, according to mental health charity Rethink Mental Illness

'Mental health services are under immense pressure, not just in Swindon and Wiltshire, but across the UK. 

'The Government promised the equal treatment of mental and physical health but this situation has illustrated just how far this equality currently is from fruition.

'Nurses and other mental health professionals are working tirelessly to provide their patients with high standards of care, but without a rapid increase in funding, resources and understanding, some of the most vulnerable members of society will continue to be failed by the health service.' 

The responsibility for caring for mental health patients in the county falls to the Avon and Wiltshire Mental Health Partnership.

But when there is a shortage of beds, the police force has step in.  

Wiltshire Police told the Advertiser its policy is not to put patients in cells, but staff are often left with no other choice.

A spokesman said the force signed the national Crisis Care Concordat last year, a national agreement between services and agencies involved in the care and support of people in crisis. 

He said: 'It specifically states that police officers should not have to consider using police custody as an alternative location if there is a lack of local mental health provision. However, in practice this does still occur but is rare and seen by police as a last resort.'  

The AWP said the opening of a new unit at Southmead Hospital, in Bristol, would help prevent similar situations in future.

A spokesman told the Advertiser: 'The unit has been used by 1,000 people and we have received some great feedback.

'The Place of Safety unit is very well run and is nursing led with medical input. The nursing team focus on giving the service user the least traumatic experience possible and also address their physical health.'

Mental illness accounts for 23 per cent of the total impact of ill health in the UK, but gets only 13 per cent of the NHS budget.

In addition mental health trusts in England have seen their budgets fall by more than eight per cent in real terms over the course of this Parliament.
