The man arrested for attempting to weapons into a screening of The Dark Knight Rises in Ohio was not planning an attack but simply wanted to protect himself.

Scott A. Smith was taken into police custody after he allegedly  tried to bring a satchel containing a loaded gun, ammunition clips 
and four knives into a 10pm Saturday showing of the Batman movie in Cleveland.

But the 37-year-old's legal representative said he was not planning a copycat action but was in fact fearing for his safety after the Aurora shootings and had brought the weapons for protection.

Copycat: Scott Smith, 37, from Ohio, was arrested on Saturday night for trying to smuggle weapons into a screening of The Dark Knight Rises

Scene: The manager of Regal Cinema in the Crocker Park shopping center, became suspicious of Smith who allegedly tried to bring a satchel into the theater

Police were called to Regal Cinemas after an off-duty police officer working security found a loaded 9mm Glock and the ammunition and knives in Mr Smith's bag.

Mr Smith was arrested and authorities believe they prevented a copycat attack of the Dark Knight Rises massacre.

Police later performed a search of the 37-year-old's home, where they found about eight rifles and handguns along with gas masks and bulletproof vests.

Mr Smith raised suspicion after arriving at the late-night screening 30 minutes early and taking a seat at the top of the theatre with his back against a wall.

Local police said this gave him a 'tactical advantage' and questioned why Mr Smith brought weapons to a movie theatre and in particular a viewing of The Dark Knight, considering the events in Aurora, Colorado.

Smith's attorney, Matthew Bruce, explained to Cleveland.com that his client was just protecting himself.

'This was simply an instance where a man felt fear going into a movie theater in light of recent shootings and incidents around the country, and he wanted protection for himself.'

Westlake Police Lt. Ray Arcuri with the Westlake Police said Mr Smith cooperated fully once suspicions were raised.

'It was a consensual 
encounter.'

Copycat: James Holmes is accused of killing 12 people in last month's shooting rampage in an Aurora, Colorado movie theater

The 37-year-old is refusing to talk to police and is being held without bail.

It comes just a few weeks after James Holmes allegedly walked into a midnight showing of the Batman movie at a Colorado theater and shot dead 12 people and injured 58.

Holmes, a former neuroscience graduate student, has been charged with 24 counts of murder and 116 counts of attempted murder and authorities have 60 days to decide whether or not they are going to seek the death penalty.

The 24-year-old's first court appearance was televised and showed a bleary-eyed young man with dyed orange hair who refused to speak.

It emerged earlier this week that the psychiatrist who counselled Holmes at the University of Colorado had warned university officials about his behaviour.

Dr Lynne Fenton told campus police and members of an University threat assessment team that she was concerned about Holmes' mental state but once Holmes left the institution they did not follow the issue as he was no longer under their jurisdiction.

Police believe Smith, who has a wife 
and young daughter, spent a short time in the military.

He does not have
a permit to carry a concealed weapon and was arrested on suspicion of illegally carrying a concealed weapon and three other weapons charges.
