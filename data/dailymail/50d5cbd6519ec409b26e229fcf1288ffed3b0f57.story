The Stop the Killer Robots will warn about the threat that robots pose to humanity, like in the 1984 American science fiction action film The Terminator directed by James Cameron

A group of academics, pressure groups and Nobel peace prize laureates is to launch an international campaign to ban 'terminators' before they reach the production stage, it was reported today.

The Stop the Killer Robots campaign will call for a global treaty on robot warfare and autonomous weapons, the next step from unmanned drones, before they become a 'threat'.

Dr Noel Sharkey, a leading robotics and artificial intelligence expert and professor at Sheffield University, said weapons like these are already being worked on by scientists and will be available within the decade.

He believes that development of the weapons is taking place in an effectively unregulated environment, with little attention being paid to moral implications and international law.

The campaign will be launched in April at the House of Commons and includes many of the groups that successfully campaigned to have international action taken against cluster bombs and landmines, The Observer reported.

Professor Sharkey told the paper: 'These things are not science fiction; they are well into development.

'The research wing of the Pentagon in the US is working on the X47B [unmanned plane] which has supersonic twists and turns with a G-force that no human being could manage, a craft which would take autonomous armed combat anywhere in the planet.

'In America they are already training more drone pilots than real aircraft pilots, looking for young men who are very good at computer games. They are looking at swarms of robots, with perhaps one person watching what they do.'

Sharkey insists he is not anti-war but deeply concerned about how quickly science is moving ahead of the presumptions underlying the Geneva convention and the international laws of war.

He disputes the justification that deploying robot soldiers would potentially save lives of real soldiers and says at present there is no mechanism in a robot's 'mind' to distinguish between a child holding up a sweet and an adult pointing a gun.

In November it was reported that a centre for 'terminator studies', 
where leading academics will study the threat that robots pose to 
humanity, is set to open at Cambridge University.

Sheffield University's Professor Noel Sharkey, a world leading robotics expert and former judge on TV's Robot Wars, is backing the campaign

The campaign will be launched by Lord Rees, the Astronomer Royal, at the House of Commons in April

Its
purpose will be to study the four greatest threats to the human species
- artificial intelligence, climate change, nuclear war and rogue 
biotechnology.

The 
Centre for the Study of Existential Risk (CSER) will be co-launched by 
Lord Rees, the astronomer royal and one of the world's top cosmologists.

Rees's 2003 book Our 
Final Century had warned that the destructiveness of humanity meant that
the species could wipe itself out by 2100.

The
idea that machines might one day take over humanity has featured in 
many science fiction books and films, including the Terminator, in which
Arnold Schwarzenegger stars as a homicidal robot.

In
1965, Irving John ‘Jack’ Good and wrote a paper for New Scientist 
called Speculations concerning the first ultra-intelligent machine.

Good,
a Cambridge-trained mathematician, Bletchley Park cryptographer, 
pioneering computer scientist and friend of Alan Turing, wrote that in 
the near future an ultra-intelligent machine would be built.

This machine, he continued, would be the 'last invention' that mankind will ever make, leading to an 'intelligence explosion.'.

For Good, who went on to advise Stanley Kubrick on 2001: a Space Odyssey, the 'survival of man' depended on the construction of this ultra-intelligent machine.
