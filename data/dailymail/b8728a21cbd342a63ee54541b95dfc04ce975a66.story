A conwoman lied about having terminal cancer, losing a baby, having a dead dog and being the victim of domestic abuse in order to cash in on fraudulent insurance claims.

Emma Fisher, 27, went to extraordinary lengths to manipulate insurers, banks and a housing association into acting on 22 fraudulent claims and made a further 43 that were not paid out.

The woman, from Willenhall, West Midlands, who was even moved into a specially-adapted home to help her cope with a non-existent disability, has been jailed.

She received £8,500 from 11 bogus insurance pay-outs between August 2008 and July 2012.

Fisher claimed she was left with permanent injuries after being the victim of domestic violence. And on one occasion she supplied a fake veterinary record to bolster her insurance claim for a dead Chihuahua dog.

She was jailed yesterday for 22 months after pleading guilty to 22 counts of fraud by false representation at Wolverhampton Crown Court.

The court was asked to take into consideration 43 additional counts of fraud relating to insurance matters when sentencing.

Fisher swindled insurers by impersonating professionals in positions of authority, including doctors and police officers, and forged documentation in support of her claims. She would then hound the issuer repeatedly on the telephone until they agreed to pay out.

Fisher’s crime spree was first uncovered in January 2012 when she was given a police caution for eight fraud offences committed between January 2009 and October 2011.

But the true extent of her repeated offending emerged three months later following referrals to the Insurance Fraud Enforcement Department (IFED) from two insurers, Direct Line and RSA.

Detective Constable Alex Cooley, who led IFED’s investigation, said: ‘Fisher was a criminal out of control who, over a number of years, devoted herself to the pursuit of making fraudulent claims in an ongoing quest to feather her own nest at the expense of others.

‘No tale was too tall, no personal hardship too extreme for her to fabricate, as she continued to offend, even after being brought to book back in 2012.’

Sean Kyne, Acting Sector Crown Prosecutor from West Midlands Crown Prosecution Service, said: ‘Motivated by greed, Emma Fisher used highly unscrupulous methods to defraud institutions out of thousands of pounds in order to fund her lifestyle.

‘The CPS will now take steps to recover the amount stolen.’
