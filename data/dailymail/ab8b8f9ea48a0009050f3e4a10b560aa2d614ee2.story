Video footage of the Queen enjoying one of her early morning horse rides has surfaced in which she cuts a relaxed figure as she trots out the gates of her Balmoral estate.

Despite approaching 90 years of age she proves old habits die hard, as she is filmed exiting the property before a saluting police officer and the surprised tourist who filmed it.

The Queen's daily horse rides started at the age of four and much of her private life is still spent indulging in her passion for all things equine.

The video was taken by a tourist visiting the area with his wife and children about two weeks ago.

Although guards told him he was unlikely to spot the Queen, he got a big surprise to see her emerge from the estate only seconds later.

The Queen has had a love affair with horses since 1930

A source said: 'He said to the security guard: "Is there any chance we'll see the Queen?" The security said "No, there's little chance", and then just after that the Queen came out'.

The Queen has been an animal lover all her life with a particular affection for dogs and horses. Indeed, one of her friends once said that if she had not been the sovereign, she would have been a perfectly content countrywoman living a life surrounded by dogs and horses.

Princess Elizabeth of York was four when she was given her first horse, a Shetland pony named Peggy. She began riding by the age of six and continues to ride for pleasure.

She also rode at the annual Trooping the Colour ceremony until 1986 (astride a black mare called Burmese from 1969). In 1981, she showed remarkable presence of mind when a mentally unstable teenager fired a starting pistol as she rode by.

She inherited many thoroughbreds when her father, King George VI, died in 1952. Her horses have won more than 1,600 races and was named British flat racing Champion Owner in 1954 and 1957.

As well as daily rides, she has been a racehorse owner for more than 60 years, breeds Highland ponies and hosts the annual Royal Windsor Horse Show at Windsor every year.

In the video she can be seen exiting the gates of her 50,000 acre estate in Aberdeenshire, Scotland, alongside a groom.

She is 
wearing her usual riding get-up of a green silk scarf over her head, a 
light brown jacket, mac and jodhpurs - an outfit now synonymous with her
 royal rides.

As the two turn right to continue their ride, she waves on a passing motorist who has stopped to let them pass.

Balmoral Estate has been in the hands of the Royal Family since Queen Victoria fell in love with the property and bought it in 1852.

While it is open to the public and 
tourists for parts of the year, it is closed off at the end of July to 
accommodate the Queen and the Royal Family's annual summer holiday.Included on the property are grouse 
moors, forestry, mountains and farmland. It is at Balmoral where the 
Queen indulges in her love of horse riding while the princes are able to
 hunt.

Although the Queen no longer rides as regularly as she once did, due in part to a niggling knee injury, she still likes to ride smaller fell ponies, a versatile working breed renowned for their steady temperament.

Her love for horses was born when she was given her first horse, a Shetland pony named Peggy, at age four.
