British scientists have recovered tuberculosis DNA from a 200 year-old Hungarian mummy.

University of Warwick researchers have recovered tuberculosis (TB) genomes from the lung tissue of the mummy using a technique known as metagenomics.

The strain of TB found in the mummy 
offered them a rare chance to study the pathogens from a time before 
antibiotics and the spread of the disease during the industrial 
revolution.

The DNA sample was taken from a lung from a mummified Hungarian woman called Terézia Hausmann, who died aged 28 in December 1797.

British scientists have recovered tuberculosis DNA from the lung tissue of a 200 year-old Hungarian mummy called Terézia Hausmann, (an artist's impression is pictured) using a new technique known as metagenomics. Her mummified remains were recovered from a crypt in the town of Vác, Hungary

Her mummified remains were recovered from
a crypt in the town of Vác, Hungary in 1994, along with 242 naturally 
mummified people - some of whom were still wearing items of clothing 
they were buried in.

Scientists
have previously performed molecular analyses of a chest sample taken 
from the mummy and deduced that her death was the result of TB.

They thought it would be possible to find TB DNA extremely well preserved in her body.

However, the team from the university have now used metagenomics to describe the open-ended sequencing of DNA from samples.

The discovery could help scientists explore the significance of mixed-strain
infections, especially during times of TB outbreaks, which could lead 
to new ways of treating mixed-strain infections.

The team, which also included scientists from University College London, Vác Museum and Budapest, had the difficult task of identifying TB DNA in a historical specimen.

The technique uses cutting-edge genome
sequencing approaches and avoids the complicated and unreliable process
of using bacteria or amplification of DNA.

The results revealed that the woman was infected with two different trains of TB bacterium.

The finding is important for tracking the evolution of microbes and could be key to fighting TB, which killed almost 1.5 million people in 2010, according to the World Health Organisation.

Mark Pallen, Professor of Microbial Genomics at Warwick Medical School, said: 'Most other attempts to recover DNA 
sequences from historical or ancient samples have suffered from the risk
of contamination, because they rely on amplification of DNA in the 
laboratory.

'The beauty of metagenomics is that it provides a simple but highly informative, assumption-free, one-size-fits-all approach that works in a wide variety of contexts'

A similar approach was used by another group of scientists to recover a leprosy genome from historical material, a few weeks ago.

The research will be published in the New England Journal of Medicine.

The DNA taken from the mummy, combined with research on contemporary TB, will be used to explore the significance of mixed-strain infections, particularly when tuberculosis is highly prevalent.

Professor Pallen said: 'It was fascinating to see the similarities between the TB genome sequences we recovered and the genome of a recent outbreak strain in Germany.

'It shows once more that using metagenomics can be remarkably effective in tracking the evolution and spread of microbes...[and] revealed that some strain lineages have been circulating in Europe for more than two centuries.'

This is the sister of Terézia Hausmann - Barbara. The mummies were found in the crypt of a Dominican church in the Hungarian town of Vác in 1994 in wooden coffins decorated with paintings of skulls

The mummies were found in the crypt of a Dominican church in the Hungarian town of Vác in 1994 in  wooden coffins decorated with paintings of skulls and have been studied to try and unlock the secrets of TB infections.

The bodies were mummified because of low temperatures and constant humidity and air pressure in the crypt and gradually dried out, according to a Fox News report from last August.

The 242 remarkably preserved bodies represented a cross section of Vác society some 200 years ago and the mummies' bones showed visible signs of TB mutations.

Almost 90 per cent of the mummies ranging from babies to people aged over 65, had been infected by TB at some point and 35 per cent were reportedly suffering from the infection at the time.
