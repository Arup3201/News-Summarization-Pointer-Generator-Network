A terror alert was sparked at Miami International Airport after a Guatemalan man allegedly joked that he had dynamite in his luggage.

Miami-Dade police said 63-year-old Alejandro Hurtado made the ill-advised joke yesterday when a ticket agent asked if he was carrying any hazardous materials, according to Fox News.

When the agent told him he was calling police, Hurtado said he was only joking.

The Concourse was partially evacuated as bomb squad officers searched Hurtado's bag but found no explosives.

Hurtado was taken into custody and charged with falsely reporting a bomb at an airport.

Airport officials say the evacuation delayed one outgoing Avianca Airlines flight by an hour, as well as some arriving international planes.
