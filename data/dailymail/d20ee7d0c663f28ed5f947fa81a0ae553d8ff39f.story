Two teenage brothers tried to rob a betting shop to prove themselves to their criminal stepfather, a court was told yesterday.

The man had challenged the 16 and 17 year olds to ‘go out and show me you’re a man’ - before they burst into a Ladbrokes in Witham, Essex, and attacked the manager, Colchester Youth Court heard.

But the pair - who cannot be named for legal reasons - fled empty-handed after the incident on January 7 this year, and were arrested eight days later after they were filmed on the shop’s CCTV.

They both admitted attempted robbery and were sent to a young offenders’ institution for a year.  The boys had been living in local authority care, one in Tiptree and one in Chelmsford.

The court heard that their stepfather, who has various convictions and also cannot be named for legal reasons, told them to ‘prove they were men’.

Philippa Beswick, representing the 16-year-old, said: ‘He wanted them to be a little team that goes out to commit robberies to make money for the house.

‘The stepfather drove them and waited around the corner until they had committed the offence. The offence would never have been carried out if it was not for the influence of the stepfather.’

Ms Beswick said her client had received abuse from his mother following the offence and had encouraged him to seek a restraining order.

'He obviously sees himself as a big criminal and wants to have a firm where his sons are out committing crimes too'

Stephen Moriaty, representing the older brother, said: ‘He obviously sees himself as a big criminal and wants to have a firm where his sons are out committing crimes too.’

Victim Linda Beales, who has managed the bookmakers for 21 years, told the court she was still suffering psychological trauma as a result of the incident.

She was on her own and closing the store when the teens burst in at about 10pm. The brothers pushed her to the ground and held her there, but eventually ran off down a nearby alleyway.

Mrs Beales, who suffered bruising and friction burns, said the incident has damaged her confidence.

She said: ‘When the shop door clicks my stomach feels sick. I am no longer confident working alone in the shop, which is a problem as it is a requirement of my job.

'This was an offence where you gained nothing, but put the victim through a tremendous amount of stress'

Matthew Batten, chairman of the bench

‘Recently when I was in a supermarket I screamed when someone ran past me. I have had flashbacks of the incident.’

The pair admitted attempted robbery and were both given 12-month detention orders. Half of the sentence will be served at a young offenders’ institution and the other half under supervision.

Matthew Batten, chairman of the bench, told them: ‘This was an offence where you gained nothing, but put the victim through a tremendous amount of stress.’
