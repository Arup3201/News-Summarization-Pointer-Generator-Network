Suspect: Roy Anthony Jones, 30 (pictured) has been charged with raping a 37-year-old female patient at
Virginia Hospital Center on January 13

A CT scan technician has been accused of raping a 37-year-old patient in a Virginia hospital room.

Roy Anthony Jones was charged yesterday with sexually assaulting the woman at Virginia Hospital Center in Arlington in the early morning hours of January 13.

The unidentified victim claimed Jones, 30, forced himself on her in the hospital's imaging center, where she was sent after receiving treatment in the emergency room.

Police said the victim returned to the emergency room and told staffers she had been sexually 
assaulted, according to myFOXdc.

Hospital spokeswoman Maryanne Boster said Jones has been sacked.

'All hospital employees go through an extensive background check prior to employment,' she said in a statement.

'As soon as the incident was reported, the 
individual was immediately placed on administrative leave and has been 
terminated.'

The Washington, D.C. man is being held without bond at the Arlington County Detention Facility, and is expected to be arraigned this week.

Arlington police arrested and charged Jones yesterday morning, after DNA samples were collected and tested.

'The problem is something could happen to anybody almost anywhere, so one always has to exude caution,' Deputy Police Chief Daniel Murray told myFOXdc.

'But I'm extremely sympathetic to a patient trying to be in a place where they're seeking treatment, where they're seeking care, and then to have something tragically like this happen to them.'

Police said hospital staff cooperated with the investigation.

NBC Washington reported Jones, believed to originally be from Cincinnati, Ohio, has a history of misdemeanor charges against him, ranging from marijuana possession to not showing up for a court hearing.
