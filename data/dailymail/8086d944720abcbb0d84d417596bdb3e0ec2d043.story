More bricks will be made this year than at any point since the financial crash, as the economic recovery fuels a boom in house building.

Factories will produce 1.73billion bricks in 2013, enough to go 9 times round the earth.

Ministers say the humble brick is a key barometer of economic growth, and demand is up by 18 per cent on last year.

This year 1.73billion bricks will be produced in the UK, the highest number since before the 2008 financial crash, according to the Brick Development Association

Orders for bricks are so high that kilns will be kept firing over Christmas for the first time since 2007 before the financial crash sent construction into freefall.

The 1.73billion bricks manufactured in 2013 is up from the 1.46billion produced last year, and the highest since 2.39billion made in 2007.

Housing Minister Kris Hopkins said the government’s flagship Help to Buy mortgage scheme had helped to persuade builders to kickstart construction across the country.

The first round of the scheme, where the state guarantees mortgages for those who struggle to save a large deposit, only applied to new homes in an attempt to stimulate demand and encourage more house building.

Mr Hopkins said: ‘Help to Buy has not only helped thousands of hard working families get on the housing ladder, it’s also laid the foundations for a recovery in housebuilding, and confounded the critics who claimed it would have no impact on the supply of new homes.’

He was speaking on a visit to a new Chesterton brick factory in Newcastle-under-Lyme, which has created 51 jobs.

Mr Hopkins added: ‘Enough bricks will be made in 2013 to go 9 times round the earth or build 28 St Pancras stations, and I’m hoping next year we’ll make enough to reach the moon.’

Eight out of 10 bricks manufactured in the UK are used for housebuilding, while orders for all building materials are now growing at the fastest rate for 10 years.

Latest figures show that construction in the three months to September was 4.1 per cent higher than the same time in 2012.

The Help to Buy scheme was extended in October to offer state-backed mortgages to people with deposits as low as 5 per cent.

It is expected to inject further activity into the market among credit-worthy buyers who have particularly struggled to get on the housing ladder or move up it since the financial crisis struck because they have a lack of upfront funds.

House prices surged by 6.5 per cent year-on-year in November, marking the fastest annual increase seen in more than three years, Nationwide reported today.

Prices have been rising every month for the last year and the latest monthly increase of 0.6 per cent took average UK house values to £174,566.

The annual increase is the strongest seen since July 2010, but Nationwide said that despite the strong pick-up in the housing market, prices are still around 6 per cent below an all-time high recorded in 2007.

Yesterday, the Bank of England took the first step in putting the brakes on the surging property market as it scrapped an initiative that has had a significant part to play in encouraging mortgage lending.

Governor Mark Carney said the Funding for Lending scheme (FLS) stimulus was no longer needed amid rising house prices, and it would instead be focused on helping small business borrowing, which remains muted.

Funding for Lending has offered lenders access to cheap finance on condition that they pass on the benefits to borrowers, and experts yesterday said that the Bank's move could spell the "beginning of the end" for ultra-cheap mortgage deals.

Fears of a looming property bubble have been growing in recent months amid a string of reports suggesting demand in the housing market far outstrips the growth in the supply of homes.

London in particular has seen strong demand this year, and Land Registry figures released yesterday showed that house prices in London were up by 8.7 per cent year-on-year in October.

But the market remains patchy and prices in the North East have dropped by 3.1 per cent year-on-year, the Land Registry figures showed.
