Girls night out: Birthday girl Victoria Beckham pictured with friends on a night out in LA

Happy Birthday darling... what time will you be coming home then?

A new poll has revealed that while romantic men are keen to spend birthdays with their other half, most women would rather celebrate another year passing on a night out with their gal pals.

The survey, conducted by online gifting 
website Findmeagift.co.uk, polled a total of 1,948 Britons, aged 18-40, 
who are all either married or in a long term relationship (a year or 
more) but who are yet to have any children.

Just one 
per cent of men opted to have a quiet birthday at home with their 
friends, whilst 73 per cent chose quality time alone with their 
significant other and just 22 per cent voted for a night out eating, 
drinking or dancing with mates.

Meanwhile,
 an overwhelming number of female respondents – 51 per cent – said a 
night out eating, drinking or dancing with friends was their ideal way 
to spend a birthday.

When asked whether they would want to have, ‘Quality time alone with a partner,’ just 38 per cent said yes.

Four per cent of men and five per cent of women opted to be alone to have, ‘Time to relax’ on their birthday.

Of the men who admitted to wanting to celebrate with just their partners, only 19 per cent said they’d tell their friends about their romantic plans prior to their birthday.

And of the remaining 71 per cent of those who would lie to their friends, 67 per cent confessed that they would try to make time for both friends and their partners during their birthday, whilst 14 per cent would lie to friends and tell them their partner had already made plans that could not be cancelled.

True romantics: 73 per cent of British men would choose to celebrate their birthday with their significant other, according to a new survey

A spokesman for Findmeagift.co.uk said: 
‘Our research suggests that men are perhaps more romantic than we 
thought and, it would seem, girls just want to have fun.

‘The
 amount of British men that admitted to feeling reluctant about exposing
 their preferred celebration plans to their friends seems to show that, 
rather than being scared of their wife or girlfriend’s wrath, it's 
friends that men are most worried about letting down.'

Respondents were also asked how they had spent the evening of their last birthday.

44
 per cent of all respondents spent the occasion indulging in some 
quality time at home or in a hotel with their partner, whilst 32 per 
cent enjoyed a night out with a group of friends.

9 per cent stated they spent their last birthday on holiday abroad.
