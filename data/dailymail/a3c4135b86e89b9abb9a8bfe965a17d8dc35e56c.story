'After a five-year battle, two bone marrow transplants and seven months in hospital fighting aplastic anaemia, Madeleine Riewoldt... couldn't fight any longer and her incredibly brave battle ended this morning at Royal Melbourne Hospital,' a statement on the club's website said.

It said Ms Riewoldt had mum Fiona, dad Joe, brother Nick and Alex, sister-in-law and nephew James by her side when she died.

'We are so proud of Madeleine for fighting as long and hard as she did,' the family said.

'This spirit is a testament to her strength, she inspired us and so many and will continue to do so.

'We are grateful for and cherish the 26 years we shared as a family and she will remain in our hearts always.'

The family also urged people to sign up to the bone marrow registry and donate blood to the Australian Red Cross as 'Madeleine's wishes were for greater awareness' of these two much needed services.

They added: '[We] are so appreciative of the fantastic work and support of the Royal Melbourne hospital staff, in particular the ICU [intensive care unit] and bone marrow teams. 

'The Riewoldt family now ask for privacy during this time.'

St Kilda president Peter Summers also released a statement, saying Ms Riewoldt would be 'sadly missed'

St Kilda president Peter Summers said his thoughts and the club's were with Nick Riewoldt and his family.

'Madeleine bravely battled illness for a long period and she will be sadly missed,' he said.

'Many St Kilda people have gotten to know Madeleine over the years. 

'In particular, she often visited the rooms after games, not only supporting Nick but as part of the Saints family.

'This is obviously an incredibly sad and tough time for Nick and his family and the club will be providing support in any way we can.'
