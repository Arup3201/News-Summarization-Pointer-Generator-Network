Former sitcom actor Giles Watling has been selected as the Conservative candidate to head off a Ukip advance in Clacton

A former sitcom actor has been selected as the Conservative candidate to head off a Ukip advance in Clacton.

Giles Watling, best known for his role in 80s series Bread, about a family living on benefits in Margaret Thatcher’s Britain, will stand against Ukip defector Douglas Carswell in next month’s crunch by-election in the Essex seaside town.

Two polls have predicted Mr Carswell, who shocked Westminster with his defection to Ukip, will retain the seat by a landslide.

If he becomes the party’s first MP, it would be a major blow to David Cameron’s authority just months before the General Election.  

Mr Watling, 61, still an actor and director who lives in the Frinton-on-Sea area of the constituency, has been a Tory councillor since 2007. His website says he has two small yachts.

He was selected last night in a US-style ‘open primary’ at Clacton town hall in which 240 local residents turned out to vote, beating Sue Lissimore, also a Tory councillor in Colchester. She was the only other candidate to make it through the local party’s election process.

Last night Mr Watling said: ‘It’s an honour and great privilege to be selected.

‘I’ve served as a councillor for seven years. I care passionately about this area and we’re going to lift it, we’re going to take it somewhere else. ‘

Most of the questions from voters, in an hour-long session chaired by LBC presenter Nick Ferrari concerned the EU, immigration and local GP services.

Michael Gove, who was knocking doors in the seaside town yesterday with a group of some 30 Tory MPs, said he believed they could win the seat by picking up Labour and Liberal Democrat supporters voting tactically for the Conservatives to keep Ukip out.

Mr Gove insisted the result remained ‘all to play for’.

He said: ‘The exciting thing is I don’t think anyone can predict how this election is going to turn out because I’ve found and my colleagues have found, people who voted Green, Labour, Liberal Democrat in the past who are going to vote Conservative because they don’t want Ukip to win’.

He did not go as far as encouraging tactical voting, saying he would try to make a positive case, but added: ‘Its a fact that we’ve met people who are switching to the Conservatives for that reason‎. That’s great.‎’

Some senior Conservatives have warned that the by-election could be a costly failure and that they should not run a vigorous campaign to keep it.

Mr Carswell, who is popular locally, won 53pc of the vote in 2010, with Labour a distant second on 25pc. Ukip did not field a candidate

Mr Carswell, who is popular locally, won 53pc of the vote in 2010, with Labour a distant second on 25pc. Ukip did not field a candidate.

But Mr Gove said MPs would be expected to campaign there and no one would get a ‘free pass’.

’Yes I’ve met people who are going to vote Ukip but I’ve met more people who voted Conservative last time round and feel disappointed that Douglas is not continuing to sit as a Conservative MP so I think it’s all to play for’, he said.  

At the Ukip headquarters in Clacton yesterday, Gordon Parkin, the party’s regional organiser for the North East who had been campaigning all week said: ‘We’ve had a great response in areas you would expect to be solidly Conservative.’
