An internet feed to his bedroom and a phone line to West Ham’s bench. Suffice to say, Sam Allardyce’s day away from the touchline was not altogether that relaxing.

His chest infection was deemed significant enough to keep him away from this fixture, but that self-imposed exile seems to have only applied to the body. The mind was firmly in south Wales, watching stuttering footage on his home computer and calling the shots to Neil McDonald via his phone.

West Ham’s manager might just have ended up with a headache for his trouble. This was a game his side should have won, having led through a goal of some beauty from Andy Carroll.

The striker reversed some of the farcical luck that has affected him this week by opening the scoring after 43 minutes, but also contrived to miss the target altogether from three yards after Mark Noble’s 74th-minute own goal pulled Swansea level.

‘I think we should have won,’ said McDonald who, along with club officials, claimed Allardyce’s illness was not serious.

‘Sam has a chest infection so he was watching a live stream on the computer and giving us a few tips on the phone. There was a delay on the live stream I think but he was happy with what we did.

‘He has taken time off to recover and he should be fine for next week (when West Ham play Everton in an FA Cup replay on Tuesday).’

That game will be an opportunity to address a winless run that now extends to five matches in all competitions. Hardly cause for major concern for a side that always faced a formidable task in replicating their form of the first half of the season.

What will bother Allardyce, though, is how some of their clear openings were not turned into goals before Swansea levelled.

Swansea are lobbying for the goal to be credited to Gomis, whose header had struck Noble after bouncing back of a post. One would expect those efforts given the Frenchman's need for confidence in his mission to replace Wilfried Bony.

Gomis celebrated that moment with a French flag in memory of those killed in the Charlie Hebdo massacre. There was evident joy in the moment, but it remains to be seen if, primarily, he is up to replacing Bony, and also if he stays in Wales. 

Clubs are interested and he has not been shy in encouraging the admirers.

Monk said: ‘I hope they give him the goal, he deserves it for the hard work he did. He is a top striker - there was not much to choose between him and Bony. 

'I brought him in and he has been frustrated but he has shown his qualities and he has a run to keep getting better.

‘The goal meant a lot for him. He wanted to show the flag. It was a very good gesture for the people hurt in Paris and that was a really nice touch.’

Gomis was less than convincing with his finishing in the first, most notably when he was presented with a sight at goal in the 30th minute and dallied. He cut inside to his right foot rather than swinging the left and allowed James Tomkins to block. Would Bony have been so hesitant?

West Ham improved, took control some excellent passing and led through Carroll’ s magnificent goal. He chested a Stewart Downing cross, evaded three men and found the top corner from the edge of the area. Not bad at the end of a week in which he missed a fixture with an injured foot – he kicked the floor in training – and sliced open his finger while making lunch.

He now has four goals and three assists in six Premier League games against Swansea. It should have been five goals but he blew an excellent late chance after Noble’s own goal.

If Allardyce's feed caught the moment his bed rest might have failed to fulfil its purpose.
