The Army should let women soldiers take career breaks to raise families and consider allowing them to fight on the front line, the Chief of the General Staff said yesterday.

Female soldiers should be allowed to enter front-line combat, Sir Peter Wall, Chief of the General Staff said yesterday

General Sir Peter Wall said that terms of service should be flexible to allow ‘individuals to dip in and out of Army careers’.

The Army’s most senior officer also opened the prospect that the Army may ease its last restrictions on women taking their place in front-line fighting. Women remain excluded from the infantry and from tank crews.

He said he wanted to show women that the army was ‘open’ and an equal opportunities employer.

A review of the role of women in combat is due before 2018, and comes at a time when other Western armies are moving to allow women soldiers into all roles.

Australia will open all units to women at the beginning of 2016, and the US last year removed its official ban on women in combat roles.

On allowing more flexible terms of service Sir Peter said: ‘That would be particularly important for females who want to take a break to have families,’ he said.

‘We’re not very good at making it easy for talented women who want to have a family and sustain a service career. If we were better at that we’d have a better Army.’

Sir Peter remained guarded about the possibility of women in hand-to-hand fighting but said in an interview with the Army’s Soldier magazine: ‘We are in a minority of armies now in that respect.

‘It’s definitely something that we need to be considering seriously but we need to go about this with great care, especially with all the other changes going on.

‘This isn’t just about getting more females into the 30 per cent of roles that are combat trades but getting more of them into the Army.’

The suggestion of the introduction of career breaks, so that young women who train as soldiers can take a few years off and then return as their children get older, comes at a time when the military are under severe pressure to build up a reserve army.

Sir Peter Wall said: 'We're not very good at making it easy for talented women who want to have a family and sustain a service career. If we were better at that we'd have a better Army'

Troop numbers are to be cut from 102,000 to 82,000 by 2020, with the shortfall to be made up by the recruitment of 35,000 reservists. Last week a senior general, Sir Richard Shirreff, described the scheme as ‘a hell of a risk’.

A flexible working contract for women soldiers could both boost recruitment by bringing mothers back into the ranks after a few years raising children, and help maintain a trained reserve of women with families.

Such a reserve force would, however, risk controversy if mothers with young families were called up in a crisis.

The idea comes at a time when mothers of young are routinely expected to work in civilian life and Government policies are bent on providing cheap childcare to encourage them to do so.

Sir Peter said: ‘Our engagement with British society is important in making sure the service is supported by the public and well manned.

He added that the withdrawal of British troops from Germany, due for completion next year, will be conducted in a family-friendly manner.

Soldiers, he said, ‘if they are married, rely on more than one income to achieve the lifestyle they want. It’s difficult to do that if you are moving back and forth to Germany on a regular basis.

‘The military covenant will give our families more surety about plugging into local health and education services in British communities and all this adds up to more stability for our personnel.’

The Army currently has 7,500 women soldiers, who serve with the artillery and engineers in front-line roles

Sir Peter said of the Army strength reductions: ‘Those were, essentially, economic choices made by the Government. We are not doing this because the threats to British interests around the world are diminishing.

‘We’ve got to be absolutely honest about our capability and the Army 2020 structure delivers most of what we can currently do, albeit with slightly less resilience.’

The Army currently has 7,500 women soldiers, who serve with the artillery and engineers in front-line roles. Women fly as fighter pilots as well as taking more traditional female duties as medics and intelligence officers. In the Royal Navy, the first women who will be allowed to serve as submariners are now in training.

Sir Peter said: ‘We have always said that we will look at the evidence and base our decision on what impact it will have on operational capability.

‘Women need to see they have equal opportunities right throughout the organisation. Allowing them to be combat troops would make us look more normal to society but there will always be people who say the close battle is no place for female soldiers.’

Opponents of women in combat roles make two central objections. The first is that the physical strength of women is insufficient for hand-to-hand fighting of the kind occasionally demanded of infantry in Iraq and Afghanistan.

The second is that in combat male soldiers would be likely to try to protect or help wounded women comrades, distracting them from their main job of trying to kill the enemy.

Australia: Roles formerly closed to women, in infantry, special forces 
and artillery, will be open to both sexes from 2016. However, as of last
 year, only 20 of the 8,000 women in the country’s defence forces had 
asked to transfer to combat units.

Canada: All duties have been open 
to women for 25 years and two per cent of combat troops are female. 
Women have served on submarines since 2000 and the first woman commander
 of a warship was appointed in 2003.

New Zealand: Equality in the 
military has been law since 2001, when women were admitted to the 
infantry, and armour and artillery units. However, a British report on 
the results found ‘variable success in attracting and recruiting women 
to these areas’.

United States: Announced last year that the ban on 
women in combat is going. However, no woman has yet been admitted to the
 Marine Corps or special forces.

Denmark: All service branches open 
to women since 1988 following a decision that women are capable of close
 fighting. However, physical strength requirements have prevented women 
from joining special forces.

France: All jobs open to women except 
submarines and riot police. However, although 20 per cent of armed 
forces personnel are women, only 1.7 per cent of the infantry is female.

Israel:
 Infantry and combat roles open to women since 1985. Over the last 
decade women have been recruited to artillery, anti-aircraft and rescue 
jobs. However, while all women must carry out military service, they are
 required to join for only two years, against three for men.
