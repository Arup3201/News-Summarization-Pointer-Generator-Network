I had to laugh this week when people started writing Steven Gerrard off. Liverpool have a few bad results and all of a sudden it’s his fault? Don’t be ridiculous.

Gerrard has bailed his team out so many times and if there is a better player who can do that job for Liverpool then I’ve yet to see him. Yes, he will need to be rested at times but there’s a big difference between being rested and being dropped.

Liverpool have lost Luis Suarez and Daniel Sturridge has been injured, so there are reasons why they are struggling. But it’s so easy to jump on the bandwagon and say people are finished. It’s just lazy.

Ask any professional: would you rather play Liverpool with or without Steven Gerrard? There will only be one answer. 

Wayne Rooney's wild challenge on Stewart Downing was cynical and unnecessary. But the truth is he could even have hurt himself.

Paul Gascoigne did something similar while playing for Spurs against Nottingham Forest in the 1991 FA Cup final. He went lunging in on Gary Charles and ended up rupturing his own cruciate ligament in his knee.

I have done plenty of stupid things on a football field but it was rash, particularly after such a good first half. Now Rooney misses three matches including a big clash against Chelsea. With competition so fierce, he will hate being out of the team.

That edge has always been a big part of Wayne’s game. It’s part of what makes him a winner and you don’t want to take that away but he needs to show greater responsibility, especially as captain.

Rooney has been quoted as saying United can still win the title. I’m not convinced they can but what else is the captain of Manchester United going to say? It would be more surprising if he had already given up after six games.

Edin Dzeko scored two superb goals against Hull, including a fantastic strike from distance that our graphic shows.

With Alvaro Negredo gone, City need all their strikers firing and Dzeko is invaluable.

The Bosnian is now something of an away-day specialist. He doesn’t score too many against the top teams, but he’s so good in those scrappy games when you need to break down the opposition, as the chart below shows.

After the start Southampton have made, there are plenty of players in that side worthy of praise. But one who is starting to stand out is Sadio Mane.

He looks absolutely electric. He cost the best part of £12million, so you would expect some big performances from him but there is always a question over foreign signings — can they handle life in the Premier League? From what I’ve seen so far, he looks perfect for it.

Mane loves cutting in from that left flank, is quick as lightning and is never short of end product.

I like what I’m seeing and if he carries on, he has the potential to rip this league apart.

At 23 years old, people might wonder why it’s taken so long for Ryan Mason to get his chance. The truth is Spurs have always had high hopes, but injuries have prevented him from playing regularly.

League debuts don’t come much tougher than starting away against your fiercest rivals but he acquitted himself well. He’s quick and can turn defence into attack in an instant — something that’s at a premium these days with counter-attacking so important.

Younes Kaboul also deserves credit. I was speaking to Sol Campbell in the Sky studio and we agreed he’s got all the attributes to be a top defender, but concentration can let him down. Saturday was the best I’ve seen him play in a long time.

Neil Warnock congratulates Jason Puncheon after Crystal Palace's win against Leicester

Neil Warnock might not have been the most popular appointment at Crystal Palace. I doubt if anyone is complaining now.

They have had some excellent results and I like what he’s done with Jason Puncheon. After Puncheon’s angry tweets aimed at Warnock last season, it would have been easy to not involve him. But Puncheon is a match-winner and Warnock nipped any issues they had in the bud.

You don’t stay in the game as long as Neil Warnock has without being able to handle difficult situations. He’s not everyone’s cup of tea, but he has made a good start and has Palace playing the same attacking football that served them so well last season.
