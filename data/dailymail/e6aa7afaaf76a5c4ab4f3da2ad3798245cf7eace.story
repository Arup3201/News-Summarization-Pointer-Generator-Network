A British teenager was stabbed 13 times and saw her boyfriend murdered in a bloodbath on a holiday island.

Maddison Wrixon, 18, tried to fight off a crazed knifeman who tied up Cristian Santana Guerra, 21, then stabbed him to death.

Miss Wrixon, who lives on the Canary island of Fuerteventura, underwent emergency surgery which saved her life.

Police said she was expected to pull through and was recovering in intensive care.

The alleged attacker, reportedly a friend of the couple, was arrested hours later by police.

Miss Wrixon is thought to have been dating Mr Guerra, from the neighbouring island of Gran Canary, for just two weeks.

The
couple were at Mr Guerra's flat in Puerto del Rosario, Fuerteventura's 
capital, when their friend David, 20, arrived yesterday afternoon.

The
friend is alleged to have pulled out a knife, threatened Mr Guerra, 
tied his hands up and stabbed him repeatedly, puncturing vital organs.

Local reports said Miss Wrixon tried 
to fight of the attacker, who then stabbed her 13 times, causing her to 
collapse on the floor.

Her boyfriend ran out of the flat, blood pouring from him, in a bid to get help.

Neighbours who heard the couple's screams called police, who found the boyfriend dead at 1pm in a hallway of the block of flats.

A police source told The Sun: 'The apartment looked like the scene of a horror movie.'

Newspapers on the island said the attacker was well known to police.

He left the knife and his mobile phone at the scene of the horrific crime, it was reported.

Maddison,
who is half Spanish, was taken by ambulance to the Virgen de la Pena 
general hospital, where she is recovering in intensive care.

A
police source said: 'This was a shockingly brutal murder. Maddison 
appears to be an innocent victim whose only crime was to try to protect 
her boyfriend.'

The
murder and attempted murder are being investigated by the National 
Police under the instructions of a magistrate at Investigative Court 1 
in Puerto de Rosario.

A spokesman for the National Police, 
said: 'We are investigating the death of a 20-year-old man and an attack
on his British girlfriend on Wednesday.

'She underwent surgery on Thursday morning and is out of danger. A 20-year-old man has been arrested.'

A source at the Interior Ministry's office in Gran Canaria said the attack was believed to have been sparked by a drug debt.
