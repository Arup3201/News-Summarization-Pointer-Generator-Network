A shocking video has allegedly revealed two well-known Mexican reporters being paid off by a notorious drug cartel king.

The 25-minute video, which was published on Sunday by Mexican news site MVS, shows drug lord Servando Gomez Martinez doling out cash to TV correspondent Eliseo Caballero, who works for Televisa, Mexico’s largest network, and Jose Luis Diaz, who owns crime-focused news agency Esquema.

Diaz provides news coverage and photos for networks including the Associated Press, CNN and Mundo Fox, He also works as a fixer in the volatile Michoacan region of Mexico for foreign journalists.

The videotape was sent anonymously to Mexican news site MVS, which claims the identities of the men are drug lord Servando Gomez, TV correspondent Eliseo Caballero and crime journalist Jose Luis Diaz 

Caballero works with Mexico's largest TV network while Jose Luis Diaz owns crime-focused news agency Esquema which works alongside international news companies

On the video tape, the three sit at a plastic table in a sparse, brightly-lit room and talk about a 'communications strategy', MVS reported, in order to improve the image of the cartel in the press.

Money can be seen exchanging hands between the drug kingpin and the two reporters. The journalists also appear to ask the drug lord for equipment. 

Servando Gomez Martinez is also known as 'La Tuta' (the teacher) and El Profe (the professor)  - as he was once a teacher.

He is head of the Knights Templar Cartel and was also a founding member of La Familia Michoacana drug cartel, a group which split from the Knights. 

Both journalists told MVS that they had accepted money from the drug lord. 

Jose Luis Diaz (pictured left) who has his own crime-focused news agency and TV correspondent Eliseo Caballero (right) said they cooperated with the cartel because they feared for their and their family's lives 

However the two veteran reporters said that they were forced to attend the meeting and were in fear for their lives and the lives of their families. 

Drug kingpin Servando Gomez Martinez has reached out to the media in the past about his cartel - claiming they were not a cartel

Paul Colford, Director of Media Relations for The Associated Press, said in a statement to MailOnline today: 'The Associated Press has used Jose Luis Diaz Perez, director of the Michoacan news agency Esquema, on a freelance basis - primarily for video services and the use of its cameramen.'

Televisa was not available for comment when contacted by MailOnline today but the company previously said that Caballero was fired after the video came to light.

Agencia Esquema was similarly unreachable for comment today but was publishing news on its website. 

Calls to CNN and Mundo Fox were not returned on Tuesday at the time of publication.

Servando Gomez Martinez sits at the top of an organization which is feared, like many of Mexico's most vicious cartels, for its beheadings and assassinations. 

However in 2012, Martinez gave an interview to Blog Del Narco, a highly-respected 'war on drugs' site, saying that his cartel wanted to join forces with others and bring down a leader of the feared Los Zetas cartel. 

He described his organization as a 'necessary evil' and saying that Knights Templar were not a cartel but a 'brotherhood'. 

Mexican journalists are often targeted and killed by drug cartels for reporting on their activities.

The Committee to Protect Journalists, a New York-based advocacy group, reveals that 30 journalists have been murdered in Mexico since 1992.
