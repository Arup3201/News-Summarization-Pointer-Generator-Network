A Swedish artist has proved his art is as good as a photo after he managed to get away with using his self-portrait on his drivers licence.

Fredrik Säker painted his self-portrait, took a photo of it and sent it to the local authorities when the time came to renew his licence.

The 29-year-old tricked staff at the Swedish Transport Agency when he sent in the photo of the painting and it was given the official seal of approval.

‘I purposely chose a bad picture. It 
felt more realistic, I don’t know anyone who holds up their drivers 
licence and says “look what a nice picture”,’ the artist told newspaper Dagens Nyheter.

Mr Säker says he had faith in his stunt, but was pleased when he was able to pick up his new drivers licence.

‘I
 thought it would go through, that’s how happy I was with the original 
painting. But you never know and I was a bit nervous whilst I waited.

'But at the same time it was a photo and I though it fulfilled all their 
criterias.'

The guidelines 
set up by the Swedish Transport Agency (STA) state that a photograph 
used for a drivers licence need to be recent and have a certain level of
 likeness to the applicant.

After the licence was issued Swedish 
newspaper Dagens Nyheter contacted the STA who were stunned to find that
 they had been conned.

Final result: Mr Saker's driving licence which used a photograph of his self-portrait good enough to fool authorities into thinking it was a picture

Although
 they say would ‘definitely not recommend’ the public using photographed
 portraits, they said they have no issues with Mr Säker’s licence and 
defend the approval saying they had no reason to believe the photo was a
 portrait.

‘I can imagine you would be able to spot defects on a larger image. The details are impossible to see on such a small picture, said STA spokesperson Peter Ranki.

Mr Säker added: ‘This picture is a milestone. It's a sign that my painting is getting better.'

Despite the STA’s comments Mr Säker has not been deterred from his latest project which involves painting ten portraits of Swedes looking to renew their licence.
