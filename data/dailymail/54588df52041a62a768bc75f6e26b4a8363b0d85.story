A village carnival has been forced to ban alcohol at its annual four-legged 'wine race' because it breaches 'health and safety rules.'

For more than 30 years, competitors at the carnival in Pewsey, Wiltshire, have donned fancy dress and dashed around the village tied together at the ankles -  downing a glass of wine at pub 'pit stops' along the way.

The strict rules of the much-loved 
competition include forfeits for those failing to down a drink, and 
time penalties for 'excessive spillages'.

But organisers have been threatened with 
prosecution for encouraging binge-drinking, and race participants have now been told they can only down non-alcoholic drinks.

The new rules were announced by organisers on their website. Wiltshire Police said licensing rules were to blame for the change.

Changes made to the Licensing Act 2003 ban licensed premises such as pubs from holding organised drinking games in which participants are required to drink an amount of alcohol within a timeframe. Landlords could be slapped with a fine of up to £20,000 if they breach the rules.

As a compromise, there will be a walking-pace contest where alcohol will be served to anyone who promises not to run and not to down it.

Jerry
 Kunkler, a Wiltshire Councillor and landlord of the village's 
Moonrakers pub, said: 'It's all to do with health and safety which I 
don't always agree with.

'We live in a nanny state and it's the minority that the rules are in place for and the majority are the ones that have to pay.

'The races have been going for 33 years and we've only had one person fall out of a wheelbarrow which isn't bad going.'

Wiltshire
 police sergeant Vince Louge said: 'The races in the last few years have
 been extremely well run and there have been little, if any, problems.

'The
 new rules are there simply to comply with new licensing laws and 
obviously we support that and the organisers have been very flexible in 
accommodating the changes.'

Carnival fortnight kicks off with the four-legged race, formerly known as the wine race.

Organiser David Major said: 'It's been a bit of a nightmare but we'll just have to see how things go.

'The changes have been coming in slowly of a period of years and we've just had to make this change to comply with the law.

'We
 won't know how it will affect entries until the day, but people have 
been talking about it, so hopefully everyone will still get into the 
spirit of things.'
