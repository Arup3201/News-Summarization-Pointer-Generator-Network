Apple is involved in 'tense talks' with major record labels to offer albums from major artists as iTunes exclusives.

It is claimed the firm has been locked in talks with label bosses following the huge success of Beyonce's self titled album.

Featuring 14 songs and 17 videos, it debuted on iTunes a week before it arrived on streaming services and YouTube - and brought record 800,000 sales in the first three days and over one million in the first week.

Apple has been locked in secret talks with label bosses following the huge success of Beyonce's self titled album.

Now Apple hopes to replicate the deal with other artists.

Billboard claims Apple iTunes director Robert Kondrk engaged in 'tense talks' with record label executives during Grammys week with a mission to secure more exclusive sales windows.

'The iTunes theory was that because of the easy availability to access albums on YouTube it has punctured sales globally for track and albums,' a major label executive told Billboard.

Apple's move comes as digital music sales fell 5.7 per cent in 2013 as users switch to streaming services such as Spotify.

According to the LA Times, music industry insiders said Apple is pushing for a new release window — similar to the one that some Hollywood studios impose for films newly released for home viewing.

'These are really changing times, and I think everybody's going to be trying different things, whether it's iTunes, Spotify or the labels,' Irving Azoff, manager of the Eagles, Christina Aguilera and other acts, told the paper.

Apple has a history of digital exlusives. In 2010 it struck a deal with the record label EMI and the Beatles' company Apple Corps to sell digital downloads of the legendary rock band's music on iTunes.

'It's kind of up for grabs.'

Apple already has 80 percent of download sales in the U.S.

However, overall, song downloads began to slump last year, and are now down about 12 percent through the first eight weeks of 2014, according to Nielsen SoundScan data.

The decline is attributed to several factors, including streaming music services like Spotify and recently launched Beats Music.

Streaming services such as Spotify are believed to have eaten into Apple's sales

According Nielson, 48% of smartphone owners use their portable devices every day to listen to streaming music, as opposed to 42% who use them for downloading music.

Another rap act relied heavily on streaming to build awareness for a forthcoming release — and debuted at the top of Billboard's album chart last week.

Schoolboy Q's "Oxymoron," was heavily promoted on Spotify, and sold nearly 139,000 copies in its first week, after

Spotify users in the U.S. had listened to 3.3 million streams in the months ahead of the album debut

'It's not a great strategy to try to dictate how people consume music when they're clearly asking for and in fact doing something different on a wide scale,' said Spotify Chief Content Officer Ken Parks.

'It just doesn't work for anyone.'
