The pressure heaped on students of Harvard College to become the next Mark Zuckerberg has caused a 'culture of cheating' to emerge claims one former graduate.

Eric Kester, the author of 'That Book About Harvard: Surviving the World's Most Famous University, One Embarrassment at a Time', has said that allegations 125 students cheated on a final exam at the venerable institution do not surprise him.

Reflecting on his own time at Harvard where he was exposed to cheating rings, Kester remarked that, 'I'm slightly sympathetic to the students, because in our society and especially at Harvard, there are high expectations to become the next Mark Zuckerberg.'

Harvard University''s main campus: The college has become embroiled in a cheating scandal that has seen 125 students put under investigation

This follows the news yesterday that officials at the Cambridge, Massachusetts university had discovered at least 125 students who they think joined forces to cheat on a take-home final exam during the spring semester this year.

Eric Kester, who graduated from Harvard in 2008 outlines a culture of pressure at Harvard College which pushes some students to cheat in his book 'That Book About Harvard'

The college is currently conducting an investigation into 250 final exams from the 'Introduction to Congress' class that is taught by Professor Matthew B. Platt after noticing similarities initially in 20 exams and after a review, 125.

'We take academic integrity very seriously because it goes to the heart of our educational mission,' said Michael D. Smith, dean of the Faculty of Arts and Sciences, in a statement.

'Academic dishonesty cannot and will not be tolerated at Harvard.'

However, for Kester, the pressure at 
Harvard can cause students to go to extremes to make sure that they 
leave the school with a degree.

'When I was a student there, I definitely noticed there was a culture of cheating there,' said Kester toÂ ABC News today.

'There's
a lot of pressure internally and externally to succeed at Harvard and 
when kids who are not used to failing feel these things, it can really 
bend their ethics in ways I didn't expect to see.'

The author, who graduated in 2008, 
says that he struggled to complete a calculus class when he was there 
and because of that was approached by a group of students who planned to
cheat.

They offered him the chance to, but after wrestling with his morals, Kester decided not to.

'It
comes down to the responsibility of the students, they're adults, they 
know cheating is wrong, that's the bottom line,' said Kester.

Noting the irony that many students are intelligent enough to complete a Harvard course without resorting to skullduggery, Kester said that the pressure is key.

'Most people who cheat at Harvard don't really need to, it's just sort of a way of making themselves feel safer of not failing,' said Kester.

'The fact that this story alone has become national story is evidence that Harvard is this lightning rod. Kids now are very aware, they've seen 'The Social Network'

'Most of these kids have spent at least high school and maybe since they were 5 or 6 years old getting into this school, doing SAT tutoring since 10 years old and going to organic chemistry summer camp. When you take that into account, you get a clearer sense of why you might be afraid.'

This comes as Harvard said they will consider instituting an honor code as it investigates whether at least 125 undergraduates cheated by working together on a take-home exam in the spring.

Officials said they intend to start broad conversations about academic honesty, including why it is vital to intellectual inquiry, in the wake of what is believed to be the largest such episode in recent school history.

'We really think we need to work harder,' said Jay M. Harris, dean of undergraduate education. 'We do think it's an opportunity to really put out before the community how much we value integrity.'

School officials said Thursday they discovered roughly half of the students in a class of at least 250 people may have shared answers or plagiarized on a final. They declined to release the name of the class or the students' names.

'These allegations, if proven, represent totally unacceptable behavior that betrays the trust upon which intellectual inquiry at Harvard depends,' President Drew Faust said.
