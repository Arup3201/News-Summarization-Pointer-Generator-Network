BB (Blemish Balm) creams have become one of the hottest trends in the beauty industry and are one of its fasting growing product areas with sales hitting £23m last year.

The multi-functional products harness smart new technology so you can replace your serum, moisturiser, primer, 
foundation and sun block with just one product.

And now, one upmarket tea company is jumping on the BB bandwagon with the unveiling of the first-ever 'beauty beverage', a drink that claims to give you a glowing complexion, detoxify your body and even aid weight loss.

Kusmi, a Parisian tea brand beloved by the fashion world and sold at their flagship London store on Marylebone High Street, have unveiled the first ever BB Detox Tea.

Following the example of BB creams, this 
£12.70 Beauty Beverage claims to cater to all your skin’s daily needs and was given to models backstage at fashion week to help with catwalk-ready skin.

The drink combines maté and green tea, which are both recognised for their effectiveness in eliminating 
excess fluid from the body and improving your skin’s appearance by 
boosting toxin removal.

The tea is flavoured with healthy dandelion and rooibos, a South African plant with a 
sweet, fruity flavour and the makers suggest drinking 6-8 cups a day for optimal results.

Inspiration: The tea follows in the footsteps of BB and CC creams, which have become the latest beauty craze in recent months

And it isn't just tea brands jumping on the BB bandwagon because the juice people, who have dominated the detoxing market over 
the last two years, want in on the BB craze, too.

New York-based juice chain Juice Generation have unveiled a DD ('dynamic do-all') 
shot.

The £2.60 ($3.95) shots are available in seven different flavors, and
 claim to address everything from improving digestion to decreasing 
inflammation.
