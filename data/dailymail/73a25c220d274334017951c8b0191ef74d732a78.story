A British writer who spent her adolescence crippled with anxiety - plus time in a psychiatric ward - turned her suffering into a book which has now been adapted for television.

Rae Earl kept a diary throughout her turbulent, overweight teens, a way of dealing with the anxiousness and paranoia that led to her being admitted to hospital aged 16.

And having turned her diary into a book - My Mad Fat Teenage Diary - Earl was then approached by producers who saw the visual potential of her story and have now adapted it for television.

My Mad Fat Diary - think Skins meets Prozac Nation for the Xanax generation - will screen this month on E4, and stars Sharon Rooney as Earl, the 1980s Lincolnshire teenager who now, aged 41, lives in Tasmania, Australia.

The tragicomic series charts 16-year-old Earl's departure from the psychiatric hospital - when she began keeping a daily diary to document her troubled thoughts - and focuses on her desire to make friends and her obsession with losing her virginity.

Earl, who weighed 16 stone as a teenager, was diagnosed with a number of mental-health disorders during the Eighties, one of which was anxiety which today afflicts 290,000 young people.

Furthermore, as many as one in 10 
young people in the UK aged between six and 16 suffer from a diagnosable
mental-health disorder - 80,000 of these from severe depression.

Earl's
own symptoms ranged from her genuinely believing she was having a 
stroke, to being convinced she had meningitis and rabies.

Via
her book - and now the series, which airs on E4 on January 14 - Earl 
hopes to remove the stigma surrounding mental health issues.
