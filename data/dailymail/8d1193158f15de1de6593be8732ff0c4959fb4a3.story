This is the moment a grieving mother was dragged shouting and screaming from her soldier son's graveside after losing a three year legal fight over where he should be buried.

Battle lines were drawn today at the Royal British Legion Club in Forfar, Angus, when Linda McComiskie and her family were refused entry to the private funeral service of her son,  private Mark Connelly.

Afghanistan war hero Private Connelly of the 3rd Battalion the Royal Regiment of Scotland, died in May 2011 from a freak punch while fighting a friend at the base in Germany in which they were stationed.

A row erupted at the graveside between mother Linda McComiskie and wife Stacy Connolly over where Mark, who suffered severe arm injuries and burns in a Taliban bomb blast in Afghanistan in 2009, should be buried

A row then erupted between mother Linda McComiskie and wife Stacy Connolly over where Mark, who suffered severe arm injuries and burns in a Taliban bomb blast in Afghanistan in 2009, should be buried.

Mrs McComiskie has always insisted that her son wished to be buried in the family lair at MacDuff Cemetery in East Wemyss, despite claims by Mrs Connolly he wanted to be laid to rest at a plot earmarked for her in Forfar.

A protracted and bitterly fought legal battle to decide the issue came to an end last year when a sheriff ruled Mrs Connolly had the right to bury him in her home town of Forfar - and blasted Mrs McComiskie for a 'distinct lack of compassion'.

After waiting more than three years while her husband lay in a morgue in London, Mrs Connolly was finally able to make arrangements to lay him to rest.

A private humanist funeral service at the Royal British Legion Club was to be followed by military burial at the Newmonthill Cemetery in Forfar.

There was a heavy police presence outside the service when a coach from Fife arrived. 

Mrs McComiskie, friends and family were then refused entry to the service.

Mark Connolly's step-father Les Sneddon, 49, said: 'We could have been told last night we weren't getting in.

The two families were split up on either side of the grave but still managed to argue

'All the way through this it has been the same. We are always the bad ones while she looks like the grieving widow.'

Mrs McComiskie said: 'Why wait until the last minute to tell us. I mean today of all days.

'This was meant to be Mark's day. She had no right to do this to us. 

'This is Mark's proper family.'

The soldier's burial was delayed by almost an hour until both sides were arranged facing each other over the empty grave. 

The hearse bearing Mr Connolly's coffin draped in a Union Flag arrived preceded by a piper.

As six of his  comrades lifted the coffin from the hearse for the slow march to the graveside, Mrs McComiskie started shouting abuse and swearing at Mrs Connolly across the empty grave.

Police were forced to intervene as Mrs McComiskie shouted: 'You are horrible despicable scum. You are not Mark's friends. I hope you are all proud of this.'

As police dragged Mrs McComiskie away both sides traded insults while six  soldiers fired volleys of shots over the grave.

She was allowed to return to her son's grave by the officers but continued to hurl abuse as Mark Connolly's comrades knelt to lower his coffin into the ground.

When the service was over and the crowds dispersed Mrs McComiskie with friends and family conducted a small private ceremony at the graveside. They left the cemetery, having removed the floral tributes they had hoped to leave at the soldier's grave.

Mrs Connolly declined to comment after the funeral but a friend said: 'We didn't want them to attend the service. 

'We feared that there would be trouble.'
