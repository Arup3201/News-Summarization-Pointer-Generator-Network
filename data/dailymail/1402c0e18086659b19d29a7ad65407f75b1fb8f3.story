A 'totally perverted' couple who got a 15-year-old boy high on party drug meow meow before pressuring him into having sex have been jailed.

Nicola Mason, of Holyhead, North Wales, had sex with the boy while her partner John Ford watched getting 'some sort of perverted pleasure', a court heard.

Now the 25-year-old mother-of-two, a former chip shop worker, has been jailed for three years while Ford, 47,will spend four-and-a-half years behind bars.

The boy was offered drugs to loosen his inhibitions and Mason performed a sex act, then full sex on a second occasion a few weeks later, Caernarfon Crown Court heard.

Judge Rhys Rowlands said the victim had been 15 in the summer of last year.

'You both took advantage of him for your own quite depraved sexual desires,' he said. 

He said Ford encouraged what happened and they no doubt thought it was funny as they were 'using' the victim. 

Ford had taunted the boy that he 'must be gay' if he was not interested in Mason. Ford watched as they had sex, getting 'some sort of perverted pleasure,' the court heard.

Judge Rowlands added: 'The two of you took advantage of the victim on two occasions.'

The prosecution had alleged that the couple liked to involve others in their sex lives. 

Ford was alleged to have encouraged other men to have sex with his partner who he met when she was 18. They denied being 'swingers.'

Ford had pleaded not guilty to inciting sexual activity and she denied sexual activity with a child. 

But the judge, who described their behaviour as 'totally perverted', told them : 'A jury saw through your lies.'

He also criticised Mason for becoming pregnant again with the case hanging over her, saying: 'Your behaviour in seeking to expand your family shows at best precious little judgement on your part.'

Prosecuting counsel Myles Wilson outlined statements from the victim in which he stated he felt 'horrible' when he thought about what happened.

It was his first sexual experience and 'something he will never forget.'

Mr Wilson said the teen had been worried that he could be the father of one of Mason's two children. 

'He's struggling to come to terms with it,' the barrister said.

Andrew Green, barrister for Ford, said he had been trying to run a taxi business. 

Simon Rogers, defending Mason, said she was of previous good character and due to give birth in February.

Mr Rogers said: 'An immediate custodial sentence of any length is going to have a profound effect upon her and her life.'

The couple, both from Holyhead, must now register as sex offenders indefinitely and a sex offences prevention order was made.
