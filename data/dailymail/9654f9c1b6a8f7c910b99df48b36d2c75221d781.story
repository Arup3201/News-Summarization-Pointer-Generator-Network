Venice has given permission for one of its most famous buildings on the Grand Canal to be converted into a Benetton 'megastore' amid fierce protest from conservationists.

The Fondaco dei Tedeschi, a 13th century palazzo, was bought by the international clothing retailer for £45million in 2008.

Despite promising to spend millions to restore the crumbling facade, the company faced strong opposition from heritage campaigners who claimed it would damage Italy's 'historical identity'.

Italia Nostra - meaning Our Italy - launched a legal bid challenging the plans and accused Benetton of buying 'full and fast' obedience from the council.

Leading the opposition at the council were representative of former comedian Beppe Grillo's 5-Star Movement (M5S) which is in the midst of potentially forming a government in Italy's hung parliament.

After more than 18 months of wrangling, the Mayor of Venice Giorgio Orsoni announced on Tuesday the project has finally been given the go-ahead.

Benetton says the project will restore the building to its original use and create 400 jobs

'We will see an important part of the city reborn,' he said.

Overlooking the famous Rialto Bridge, the building was originally built to house German merchants and combined offices, living quarters and a market.

Mayor Orsoni drew criticism for allowing large advertising hoardings to be displayed on the Venice's Grand Canal

Thousands of tourists stop every day to take photos of its magnificent facade, once painted by 18th century landscape artist Canaletto.

Benetton have enlisted the services of Dutch architect Rem Koolhaas to turn it into a shopping centre and public area inside the building's 10,000 square metres of floor space.

The company says the project will bring the building back to its original use - as well as creating 400 jobs.

Crucially, they will also pay £5.2million into the city's coffers as a fee for the change of use.

Venice faces unique environmental challenges, as it continues to slowly sink into the lagoon.

In 2010, the city drew criticism for allowing large floodlit advertising hoards for Coca-Cola, Rolex and Bulgari to adorn palaces up and down the Grand Canal.

But Mayor Orsoni says the funds raised are vital for the city's future and that project's such as the Benetton store will boost employment and broaden the appeal for tourists.

'It will bring great advantages to Venice,' he added.
