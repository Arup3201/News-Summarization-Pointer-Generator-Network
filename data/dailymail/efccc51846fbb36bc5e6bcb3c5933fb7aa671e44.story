Lord McNally told peers he had tried in vain to block claims firms from calling him at home

A government minister has revealed his exasperation at being plagued by nuisance calls offering help claiming back PPI and has called on phone watchdog Ofcom to investigate.

Justice minister Lord McNally said he
had added his number to a register to not receive the calls and was astonished to find it did not work.

The exasperated peer has now written to regulator Ofcom to highlight the problem, which has plagued millions of Brits for years.

There are thought to be almost 1,000 claims management companies offering to help people claim back PPI which was mis-sold by banks and secure thousands of pounds in compensation.

But homeowners have been inundated with phone calls and text messages offering help they either do not want or need.

Homeowners can register their number with the Telephone Preference Service, which is supposed to put a bar on marketing calls.

But Lord McNally said: ‘We at home are supposed to be on this blocking mechanism that you sign up for, but the calls still get through.’

Speaking during questions in the House of Lords, he told Baroness Gardner of Parkes that he would investigate whether international calls get round the blocking.

Baroness Gardner said she received six phone calls a week and sometimes three or four a day, 'all offering me wonderful things'.

Lord McNally said: ‘I know that Ofcom is very much aware of this problem. I know that it is no use me telling the noble Baroness that she can go on to this register and that Ofcom is on the job and so on, because from the noises around the room and my own experience, I know that these nuisance calls are still getting through.’

Richard Lloyd, executive director of 
consumer group Which?, said: 'Our research found that people who sign up
to the Telephone Preference Service (TPS) have about a third fewer cold
calls, so it is useful. But firms calling from overseas or flouting the
rules are still getting away with it.  

'Despite
up to 10,000 complaints a month to the TPS, the Information 
Commissioner's Office (ICO) hasn't issued a single fine for nuisance 
calling. The ICO must take tough enforcement action now by naming and 
shaming companies that are still calling people registered with the TPS 
and fining those found breaking the rules.'

Last month businessman Richard Herman won a major victory after taking a cold-call firm to court and winning compensation to a businessman for wasting his time.

The 53-year-old turned the tables by invoicing one of the firms for £10 for every minute he wasted answering their telephone calls.

He also recorded the calls, meaning 
that when the unscrupulous company denied ever having rung him, he was 
armed with incontrovertible proof to the contrary.

The Ministry of Justice has set up a claims management regulation unit which is working with the Information Commissioner to investigate individual firms receiving leads or claims as a result of unsolicited text messages, and is taking enforcement action as appropriate.

Labour's Lord Kennedy of Southwark said nuisance calls were a 'serious problem' and demanded to know what the government was going to do about it.

'The mis-selling of payment protection insurance was an absolute scandal, but the activities of some claims management companies are also a scandal, with unwanted text messages and phone calls.'

Responsibility for tackling nuisance calls lies with media watchdog Ofcom and the Information Commissioner’s office, depending on the type of call being received. 

The ICO can take enforcement action to stop nuisance calls and messages and can now impose penalties of up to £500,000 for serious breaches of the Privacy and Electronic Communications Regulations.

Ofcom maintains the Telephone Preference Service register which records the homes which do not want to receive direct marketing calls but the ICO is responsible for taking action against firms who breach it.

Ofcom also deals with abandoned and silent calls and is currently investigating energy firm npower and phone and broadband company TalkTalk. The watchdog could issue fines of up to £2million.

An Ofcom spokesman said: 'All organisations are banned from cold-calling consumers who are registered with the TPS unless a consumer has given the company their express permission to do so. We are concerned that consumers are still receiving unsolicited sales or marketing calls, despite being registered with the TPS. 

'We would encourage all affected consumers to complain to the TPS who will contact the companies involved requesting that they remove the consumers’ numbers and will also send details of those complaints to the ICO, as the body responsible for taking enforcement action against companies who break the rules.'

Former High Court judge Baroness Butler-Sloss also called for spam emails about PPI to be investigated.

'I get an enormous number of e-mails every day, generally about PPI but about a whole lot of other things, too.

'They all seem to be done at about three in the morning. E-mails are just as serious; I spend such a lot of time just deleting all these e-mails on a daily basis.'
