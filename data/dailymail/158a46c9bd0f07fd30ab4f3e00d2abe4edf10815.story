Accused Cleveland kidnapper Ariel Castro told a judge today 'porn took its toll on me' as he accepted a plea deal under which he will serve a life sentence plus 1,000 years for the kidnap and rape of three women.

Castro was said to have agreed to the deal - after initially pleading not guilty to all 977 counts against him - to spare him the death penalty. His previous not guilty pleas were withdrawn.

It also means his three victims Amanda Berry, Michelle Knight and Gina DeJesus will not have to testify about their more than ten-year ordeal in front of a jury.

Ariel Castro has pleaded guilty to 937 counts, including kidnapping, rape, assault and aggravated murder and is due to be sentenced on Thursday

Guilty: Under the plea deal, Castro, 53, will spend the rest of his life behind bars plus 1,000 years, without the possibility of parole

Castro said today: 'There 
are some things I do not comprehend because of my sexual problems 
throughout the years. But I trust my lawyers and I understand my rights 
and the sentence'

All three victims - Amanda Berry, Michelle Knight and Gina DeJesus - appeared in a video in early July thanking the local community for its support

They 
released a statement today saying they were relieved at the news, are 
satisfied by the resolution and are looking forward to the end of the 
legal side of their ordeal.

Speaking in court today, Castro said: 'I said I was willing to work with the FBI and I would tell them everything.'

The 
judge asked him the 53-year-old if he understood that he would die in prison and there 
would never be a possibility he would be released from prison.

He replied: 'I do understand that and I said because of the sex crimes I knew I would have the book thrown at me.

'There 
are some things I do not comprehend because of my sexual problems 
throughout the years. But I trust my lawyers and I understand my rights 
and the sentence.'

He said he read and signed the plea deal and understood it though 'my addiction to pornography and my sexual problem has taken a toll on my mind' that sometimes caused problems with comprehension.

Offering some form of an explanation for his despicable crimes, he said: 'I was a victim as a child and it just kept going.'

The judge cut him off and told him to save his story for his sentencing hearing.

Castro spoke clearly and intelligibly today in court, answering all the judges questions with clarity. This is in stark contrast to his previous appearances when he has kept his head down, closed his eyes and refused to interact.

Plea Deal: Ariel Castro, 53, walks into the court room with his head down for a pre-trial hearing on charges including rape, kidnapping and murder in Cleveland, Ohio July 24, 2013

Prosecutors said if evidence of additional crimes came to light, Castro could still be indicted on future charges that included the death penalty.

Castro's
lawyers have said for weeks that they would consider an agreement under
which the former Cleveland school bus driver would plead guilty to some
charges in return for his life.

Castro,
53, has been charged with 977 counts including kidnapping and repeated 
rape. He has also been charged with murder under a fetal homicide law 
for allegedly forcing one of the women to miscarry.

Gina
DeJesus, 23, Michelle Knight, 32, and Amanda Berry, 27 were freed from 
Castro's home in a rundown area of Cleveland in May.

The three women disappeared separately between 2002 and 2004, when they were 14, 16 and 20 years old. Each said they had accepted a ride from Castro, who remained friends with the family of one of the women and even attended vigils over the years marking her disappearance.

The house will be torn down, it was revealed this week.

Also freed was a six-year-old girl who, according to DNA evidence, was fathered by Castro 
with Berry during her captivity.

The
women had been bound for periods of time in chains or ropes and endured
starvation, beatings and sexual assaults, according to court documents 
and a police report. Avoiding a trial would spare them from having to 
testify.

A grand jury on July 17 added 648 charges to a previous indictment against Castro and an $8million bond was put in place.

The 977-count indictment against Castro includes charges of rape and kidnapping and two counts of aggravated murder on accusations that Castro starved and punched one of the women while she was pregnant until she miscarried.

The indictment alleges he repeatedly restrained the women, sometimes chaining them to a pole in a basement, to a bedroom heater or inside a van and assaulting them with a vacuum cord if they tried to escape

News that the women had been found 
alive electrified the Cleveland area, where two of the victims were 
household names after years of searches, publicity and vigils.

But elation soon turned to shock as allegations about their treatment began to emerge.

The
indictment against Castro alleges he repeatedly restrained the women, 
sometimes chaining them to a pole in a basement, to a bedroom heater or 
inside a van.

It says one of the women tried to escape and he assaulted her with a vacuum cord around her neck.
