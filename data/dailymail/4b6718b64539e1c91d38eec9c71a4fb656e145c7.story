New parents will know the constant worry and paranoia that comes when a child sleeps in their own room for the first time. 

To help relieve some of this pressure, a group of MIT graduates have created a smart babygrow called Mimo that can track a baby’s breathing, temperature and movements. 

All this information is then sent to a smartphone app, and it can be used to either reassure the parents that everything is okay or alert them if there’s a problem.

The Mimo system was created by a team of parents from Boston. Sensors are fitted to the child's babygrow, pictured, to monitor their activity. The stripes track breathing, temperature and motion and this data can be monitored via an Android or iOS app

Mimo Kimonos are fitted with a removable turtle-shaped sensor. 

This
 sensor tracks movements of the baby, and two stripes along the babygrow record changes in breathing and temperature.

This data is sent to an Android or iOS app.

Timeline mode gives a summary of the past 24 hours, including how many 
hours the child was asleep and when it was last fed.

Live Monitor mode tells the parent what position the baby is in, the 
temperature of the child’s room and also shows changes in breathing, in 
real-time. 

The Mimo system was unveiled during the Consumer Electronics Show in Vegas and runs on the new Intel Edison - a computer the size of an SD card. 

The specially-designed babygrows in the Mimo range, called Mimo Kimonos, are fitted with a removable turtle-shaped sensor.

This sensor is fitted with a computer and tracks the movements of the baby.

Two stripes along the babygrow are fitted with additional sensors to record changes in the child’s breathing and temperature. 

The Edison computer analyses the data and sends it to an Android or iOS app in the form of graphs. 

A Timeline mode gives a summary of the past 24 hours, including how many hours the child was asleep and when it was last fed, for example.

While the Live Monitor tells the parent what position the baby is in, the temperature of the child’s room and also shows changes in breathing, in real-time. 

Parents can additionally press the Listen button to listen to the baby and its surroundings, and an algorithm can even work out when a baby is about to fall asleep to prevent them from being disturbed.

The Mimo system is available for children aged from newborn up to 12 months and goes on sale in February. 

A Starter Package costs $199.99 (£120) and includes three Mimo Kimonos, one Turtle sensor, and a Lilypad used for charging the turtle.
