A fifth of graduates are unemployed or in unsalaried or low-paid posts six months after leaving university, official figures reveal.

One in ten are out of work and a similar proportion are on internships, doing voluntary work or travelling.

Those that have found employment are often stuck in menial jobs such as window cleaning, packing or bottling and stacking shelves.

The research by the Higher Education Statistics Agency paints a sobering picture for young university leavers who have spent at least three years studying and have built up large debts.

It shows many are emerging into a hugely competitive job market where they may wait years before securing meaningful employment.

The trebling of tuition fees last year to a maximum of £9,000 has created the prospect of thousands of students leaving university in two years with debts of £40,000 or more once living costs are added - and no prospect of starting to pay it off for the foreseeable future.

Details were released at the same time as a Confederation of British Industry report warned too many sixth formers were being pushed into the ‘default’ university route instead of considering vocational courses and on-the-job training.

Key industries such as manufacturing, construction, IT and engineering face a recruitment crisis as a result, it said.

Of the 190,000 full-time first degree leavers in 2011-2012 who took part in the HESA survey, more than 17 per cent said they had continued studying.

Two-thirds said they were working - but barely more than half were on permanent contracts.Six per cent said they had taken basic, unskilled work such as manning rubbish trucks or sorting mail.

Two per cent were doing internships, 1.3 per cent were involved in voluntary work and 2.7 per cent classified themselves as other/unknown, a category which includes ‘developing a portfolio’.

Another five per cent had opted to travel or do ‘something else’.

Opportunities for university leavers 
have shrunk by four per cent since last year, according to a survey by 
the Association of Graduate Recruiters earlier this month.

Banking and finance has seen 45 per cent of jobs evaporate, while accountancy and professional services firms have 17 per cent fewer vacancies.

At the same time the pay premium gained from higher education is being eroded, creating a double whammy for graduates.

Twenty years ago they earned 52 per cent more on average than workers with lower or no qualifications. Now that is down to 27 per cent.

National Union of Students president Toni Pearce said: ‘Many of those entering the work-place for the first time are finding it hard to find a job that matches their skills.

‘Those taking their first step on the career ladder are willing to work hard and pay their dues but employers must stop exploiting them through things like unpaid internships.’

The CBI report called for a university admissions-style system to be set up to help more young people apply for apprenticeships and vocational courses.

This is needed to prevent a chronic shortage of suitable workers as it estimated the majority of posts created between now and 2020 will be in high-skilled jobs.

‘What is now seen as the “default route” of an undergraduate degree is not suitable for all - young people have different talents and learn in different ways,’ the report said.

‘We should aim to inspire but also be realistic, setting out the costs and likely return on options open to young people, including the vocational options that have long been undersold.’

Policy director Katja Hall added: ‘We need to tackle the perception that the A-levels and three-year degree model is the only route to a good career.

‘When faced with a £27,000 debt, young people are already becoming much savvier in shopping around for routes to give them a competitive edge in a tighter job market.’
