Plastic pollution is not just confined to the world’s oceans, it is threatening life some of the world’s most beautiful lakes too, scientists warn.

Although many lakes in the Alps might look pristine, beneath the surface there are billions of tiny particles which have broken down from plastic bottles, wrappings and other rubbish that are slowly entering the food chain.

Researchers have found Italy’s Lake Garda - a popular holiday destination for families and those keen on water sports such as windsurfing - is contaminated with potentially hazardous tiny microplastics.

Many sub-alpine lakes might look pristine, but new evidence suggests they may also be contaminated with potentially hazardous plastics. Pictured are some samples of plastic waste and microplastics found in Lake Garda in Italy

Scientists from the University of Bayreuth in Germany believe the microplastics could be getting into food chain through a wide range of freshwater invertebrates.

Over the past 60 years plastic has become central to everyday life but the planet has been subjected to a huge quality of non-biodegradable waste, much of which ends up floating in the world’s oceans.

Scientists expected the sub-alpine lakes to be free from plastic pollution but the findings suggest all inland waterways could be contaminated.

Past research has shown fish, birds 
and mammals are ingesting plastic particles which are retained within 
their digestive system, slowly releasing chemicals into their bodies.

Other
research showed the plastic surface of these particles is adsorbing 
chemicals from the surrounding water an concentrating them - making them
even more harmful.

The persistent organic pollutants (POPs) have been linked with numerous health conditions such as low sperm count, infant development, weakened immune systems and genetic defects.

The plastics also allow alien species to invade other environments threatening biodiversity.

Christian Laforsch of the University of Bayreuth in Germany said: 'Next to mechanical impairments of swallowed plastics mistaken as food, many plastic-associated chemicals have been shown to be carcinogenic, endocrine-disrupting, or acutely toxic.

The study showed freshwater invertebrates (a crustacean is pictured)will ingest artificially ground fluorescent microplastics in the lab

'Moreover, the polymers can adsorb toxic hydrophobic organic pollutants and transport these compounds to otherwise less polluted habitats.'

'Along this line, plastic debris can act as vector for alien species and diseases.'

The researchers chose Lake Garda as a starting point for investigating freshwater contamination with micro plastics and normal plastic waste, because they expected it to be less polluted given its sub-alpine location.

What they found surprised them because the numbers of microplastic particles in sediment samples from Lake Garda were similar to those found in studies of marine beach sediments.

The size ranges of microplastics found suggested that they might find their way into organisms living in the lake.

Christian Laforsch said many plastic-associated chemicals have been shown to be carcinogenic or acutely toxic. Pictured are scanning electron microscope images of degraded plastic particles showing examples of surface textures on sampled plastic particles

The study, published in Current Biology, showed that freshwater invertebrates from worms to water fleas will ingest artificially ground fluorescent microplastics in the lab.

And the findings in Lake Garda come as bad news for lakes generally, with uncertain ecological and economic consequences.

Dr Laforsch said: 'The mere existence of microplastic particles in a sub-alpine headwater suggests an even higher relevance of plastic particles in lowland waters.'

While he admitted that more research is needed, he called for standardised surveillance guidelines to control microplastic contamination in freshwater ecosystems, which are already required for marine systems.
