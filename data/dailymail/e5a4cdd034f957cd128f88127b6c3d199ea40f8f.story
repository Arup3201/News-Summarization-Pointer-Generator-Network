One member of the gang, Jalil Ahmed, 36,  bought the personalised number plate for his £60,000 silver Mercedes.

Ahmed, of Solihull, West Mids., was jailed for eight years along with five other members of the gang in March after they were convicted of money laundering and drug offences.

On Friday Abid Hussain, 45, and Arshad Hanif, 52, both from Leeds, were caged for two years each at Birmingham Crown Court after they were also found guilty of money laundering offences.

Following the sentencing, restrictions were lifted to allow details of the case to be reported.

The court heard the group worked with criminals in the Middle East and Pakistan to transfer drug money for crooks in the UK and Europe.

Surveillance teams from the Serious Organised Crime Agency (SOCA) monitored the gang as they moved tens of thousands of pounds around the country in plastic carrier bags.

The used a money laundering technique known as 'cuckoo smurfing', the court heard.

In the ruse, dirty cash was transferred through the accounts of legitimate and unwitting customers who were expecting genuine payments from overseas.

Sahil Khan, 27, of Solihull, West Midlands (left)  was given 12-and-a-half years and Abid Hussain, 45, of Leeds, (right) was handed two years

Gary Brockway, 41, of Stafford, was given two-and-a-half years and Khayam Naseem Chib, 31, of Kings Heath, Birmingham, (right) four years

The investigation resulted in the seizure of more than £730,000 and 1.5kg of heroin.

Officers found the group had laundered about £19 million between January, 2011 and March 2012.

Judge Simon Drew QC told property developers Hussain and Hanif: 'You have both lost your reputations within the community and suffered, no doubt, substantial public humiliation.'

After the case Sarah Goodall, SOCA regional head of investigations, said: 'Money is the engine that drives organised crime and criminals such as these men are purely motivated by profit.

'The crimes that have been committed to generate the huge sums of cash that this group has helped to launder will have a lasting effect on local communities.'
