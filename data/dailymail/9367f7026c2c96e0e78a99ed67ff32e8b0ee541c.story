Louis van Gaal has revealed he would love to be the next manager of Manchester United.

The 62-year-old Dutchman will be unveiled as the new Old Trafford boss next week, once he and the club have agreed the make-up of his coaching staff.

Speaking in Holland, the Dutch national coach said he he is still speaking to other clubs, but was quite happy to let it be known how much he wants the United job.

‘I would love the (United) job,’ Van Gaal told BBC Sport. ‘For every coach who takes the job it’s a fantastic challenge.

‘I
 hope I shall be the one but you’ll have to wait and see. There are more
 clubs interested. I have more options. It is a process we’re in and 
everybody has to wait patiently on my choice and that of the clubs.

‘But United are the biggest club in the world’.

United had hoped to officially unveil Van Gaal as David Moyes’ replacement this week.

They have agreed most of the details with the former Ajax, Barcelona and 
Bayern Munich coach but want to announce his appointment, and the 
composition of his coaching staff, all at the same time, rather than 
have a drip-feed of information as was the case when Moyes took the job 
last year.

United also have 
to be sensitive to the needs and demands of the Dutch FA. Holland have a
 World Cup to prepare for under Van Gaal and understandably do not want 
their preparations disrupted by the publicity surrounding their coach’s 
future beyond Brazil 2014.

Through the door: Van Gaal says United are the biggest club in the world

As
 Van Gaal gets ready to take over, Phil Neville, one of the United 
coaching team under the sacked Moyes, revealed how the Old Trafford lap 
of honour after Tuesday’s 3-1 win over Hull City was the emptiest moment
 of his career. Neville could not hide his pain as he spoke about the 
traumas of a season that reduced England’s most successful club to an 
object of fun.

‘It’s been a
 real difficult season,’ said Neville. ‘A club that should be 
challenging for league titles to  finish seventh is obviously not good 
enough. And to see a man who, for the last eight years, has put so much 
confidence in me — to see him lose his job was probably one of the 
toughest days I’ve had in football.

‘Walking
 around the pitch after the Hull game was probably the emptiest I’ve 
ever felt on a football field. I took the job expecting to be walking 
around the last home game of the season either challenging for a league 
title or parading a league title. That’s what this club demands and 
we’ve got to make sure next season we are doing that.’

All smiles: It is unknown whether current interim manager Ryan Giggs will stay at Old Trafford

It
 has been the fall of Moyes that has particularly stung Neville. ‘He has
 taken the majority of criticism from outside the club, but if you speak
 to anyone inside then we’ve all got to take collective responsibility —
 from players, the staff, the coaching staff, everybody,’ said Neville.

‘It
 was really disappointing when David lost his job because I class him as
 a friend. As a player, I’ve never experienced anything like that with a
 manager — maybe once with Kevin Keegan at England, when he lost his 
job.

‘The thing we’ve all 
collectively failed on is definitely that we have lost eight games (in 
all competitions) at Old Trafford this season. That is not acceptable.

‘If
 we played all our games away, then we’d be champions. But we’ve lost 
games at Old Trafford against teams that we should be beating. That has 
been the biggest single failing.’

Happy: But Phil Neville, with Robin van Persie, slammed United's dismal season

Neville’s
 future, and that of the rest of the Class of ’92 — Ryan Giggs, Nicky 
Butt and Paul Scholes — is uncertain pending Van Gaal’s arrival after 
Sunday’s final game of the season against Southampton but Neville is 
keen to stay on.

‘I don’t know what’s around the corner for me in terms of my own personal job,’ said Neville.

‘But
 the season as a whole has just not been good enough. We’ve got to make 
sure next season, whoever is in charge and whoever is coaching, that we 
get back challenging for league titles.

‘I want to be part of United’s future, I’m a Manchester United person, I love the club.

‘Results
 aside, it’s been an incredible learning experience at a club that I 
love. I want to be here for the rest of my life, being involved with 
United. So that’s my hope.’
