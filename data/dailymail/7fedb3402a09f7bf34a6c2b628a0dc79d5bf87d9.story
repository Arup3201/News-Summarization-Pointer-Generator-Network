Lauren Blanning, 19, has been jailed for 16 months for drink driving after she pulled into the path of a biker having drunk a bottle of rose wine

A husband left crippled by a teenage girl who downed a bottle of rosé before getting behind the wheel has condemned her ‘totally insubstantial’ 16-month jail term.

Motorcyclist Stephen Isaacs was flung 60ft and suffered severe pelvic injuries after Lauren Blanning pulled out in front of him while on the way home from the pub with friends.

Newlywed Mr Isaacs, 49, has been told he is unlikely to walk again. 

But Blanning, 19, could be free in as little as eight months and will be let back on the road. 

Last night, wheelchair-bound Mr Isaacs criticised the sentence handed down at Bristol Crown Court.

He said: ‘We were led to believe she would be charged with grievous bodily harm, with a 14-year maximum – a sentence in a decent range which she would serve as a result. 

'I think the 16- month sentence is utterly and totally insubstantial.’

Blanning has said she is ‘sickened’ by her role in the crash. 

But Mr Isaacs said her remorse was not genuine, adding: ‘I think they are crocodile tears. It’s more about feeling sorry for herself.’

The teenager, who passed her driving test three months before the smash in Bristol last May, was nearly twice the legal drink-drive limit when she drove her Ford Ka into the biker’s path.

When she was given a breath test she told police: ‘I know I will fail, I’ve had a bottle of wine.’

Mr Isaacs, an aircraft fitter for 26 years, is still being treated at hospital and is unable to return to work after the accident, which he cannot remember. He had been on his way home and stopped to pick up a takeaway. The next thing he recalls is waking in hospital two weeks later.

Biker Stephen Isaacs (pictured with wife Susanne on his wedding day in September 2013) was thrown over the top of Blanning's car and 60ft down the road, suffering massive pelvis injuries

Surgeons had battled to save his life and he ‘died’ on the operating table before being revived. He lost so much blood that he received 60 pints in 48 hours, and has had multiple operations.

Mr Isaacs' injuries were so severe he had to be resuscitated on the operating table in hospital, needed 60 pints of blood transfusions in 48 hours, and has been told it is very unlikely he will walk again

Blanning’s car was travelling at 12mph at the time of the accident, the court heard. But a collision investigator said Mr Isaacs did not have enough time to react and there was nothing he could have done to prevent the 1am crash.

After the hearing the victim said his main regret was not being able to be there for his father who died after falling ill in December. But Mr Isaacs – who used to enjoy kayaking, hiking and skiing – said the crash had made him a better man and paid tribute to his wife Susanne, 45, whom he married in September 2013.

He said: ‘I’m a determined person. I think I’ll do cross-country wheelchairing and world travel. This has changed me. But I would not be here without my wife.’

The first thing Blanning did after the smash was phone her mother in ‘desperation, fear, panic and shock’, the court heard. She later told police the motorcyclist was going a ‘bit fast’ but tests proved he was doing 32mph.

Blanning was jailed for 16 months after admitting causing serious injury by dangerous driving and driving with excess alcohol. She had been found to have 62 micrograms of alcohol in 100 millilitres of breath. The legal limit is 35.

Judge Michael Roach, sentencing, said Blanning’s ‘stupidity’ had wrecked a life.

He told her: ‘Nothing I can say can restore his good health. Nothing I can say can restore anything he and others had to suffer through your stupidity.’

Blanning’s lawyer Darren Burleigh read a note from his client which said: ‘I can’t begin to imagine what I put Mr Isaacs and his family through. It sickens me that I played a part in such a tragic accident. I can never make it up to them. I hope what happens today lifts a heavy weight off their shoulders.’ He added: ‘She made a foolish decision to drive a very short distance from the pub to her friend’s house.

‘For that she knows she will have to be punished. The impact will never be reflected in any sentence.’

Blanning was also banned from driving for three years and must take a test before returning to the road.

Mr Isaacs has been bed-bound at Southmead Hospital since the accident in May last year and today branded Blanning's sentence 'utterly and totally unsubstantial'

Blanning called her mother in a panic after the accident, and initially tried to claim Mr Isaacs had been travelling 'a bit fast', but later tests showed he was going at 32mph

Mr Isaacs has lost his job of 26-years following the horror crash after his injuries left him unable to return to work and now has to manage his spinal pain using an inflatable mattress
