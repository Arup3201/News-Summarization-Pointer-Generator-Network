A donations page set up by the family of a seasoned sky diver who was seriously injured when he lost control of his parachute has paid for his medical bills and then some.

Ben Cornick, 31, fell 12,000 feet Tuesday without anything to slow his fall but the parked van he landed on at an estimated 40mph. A lack of health insurance led to him paying around $33,000 in medical bills until internet samaritans donated more than enough to help defray the cost.

The donations were made through a Facebook page that has garnered more than 6,800 members and over $80,000 in donations in less than a week.

Skydiver Ben Cornick who needs emergency on his leg following a horrific skydiving accident in Fiji

Mr Cornick, a father-of-one, was attempting a 12,000ft jump when he lost control of his parachute

Mr Cornick's troubles began shortly after jumping out of the plane while 12,000 feet above Fiji.

He lost control of his parachute due to a faulty steering toggle, and crash landed at roughly 40mph into a parked van.

Mr Cornick broke both his leg in three places and snapped his arm in half - doctors initially feared he may lose the leg if it wasn't operated on immediately.

The Swansea native is a sky diving instructor in Fiji and Australia with more than 1,000 jumps under his belt, it was the first time he had an accident of this magnitude.

His health insurance did not cover the jump due to a quirk in regulations regarding the tour group he was with, according to a relative who posted on the Facebook page.

In agony: The pain momentarily gets the best of the injured skydiver

Fijian doctors
 said they were unable to pin his limbs together 
and said he would need to be flown to New Zealand, on an
 emergency flight.

This forced him to have to pay about 
$33,000 in medical bills upfront before being airlifted to Auckland 
for surgeries to save his leg and repair other damage to his body.

The Welsh skydiver's cousin Ricky Davies created a Facebook donations page and reached the fundraising goal within hours.

What happened next was completely unexpected, the page more than doubled its initial target and raised more than enough to pay for the surgery and follow up care.

Even more astonishing, a British physical therapist offered free rehabilitation services for the duration of Mr Cornick's recovery, accroding to a post on the Facebook page.

Mr Davies, a skydiver himself, said: 'While he was doing the swoop the toggle came out of his hand and he hadn't completed the turn.'

This caused Mr Cornick to spiral out of control and make the crash landing, he is lucky to be alive.

'I spoke to Ben and he was a bit groggy from the drugs he is on but that's what I could make out,' Mr Davies added. 'His right femur snapped in three places.

'His left arm between his shoulder and elbow is in half and he has got cuts and bruises and damaged his knee- cap.

'In Fiji, they have only got small hospitals. They had a look at him but couldn't pin and screw that together.'

Friends of the experienced skydiver raised the money in a matter of hours, and he was moved to New Zealand

Mr Davie added: 'His parents haven't got that sort of money, I haven't got that sort of money.

'I
 got on Facebook and spoke to a few skydivers to see if they had any 
contacts. I put up the page where we can all go.

'Now, we have saved his 
leg and possibly his life.'

Mr Cornick's ordeal has received widespread media attention around the world, likely leading to the high number of donations.

Being stuck with the full bill would have put a serious crimp in his ability to care for his 11-month-old son.

Mr Cornick was due to have surgery last night. His family said before the procedure he was doing well

Mr Cornick's family are continuing to appeal for money as they are unsure whether he will need further medical care

Mr Davies told the Western Mail: 'The
 page was set up at about 9pm or 10pm on Wednesday. I think it was about
 16 hours from starting the Facebook page that we accomplished the ($33,000).

'The guys in 
Auckland wouldn't transport Ben until they had the money up front. It is
 actually another, fellow skydiver who paid the (fees) up front on my 
word that I would give him the money back.'

Mr Davies said they did not know what the cost of the operation or Ben's continued medical care would be, so the fundraising will carry on.
