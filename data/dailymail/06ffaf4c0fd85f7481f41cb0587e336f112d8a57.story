An out-of-work Wisconsin electrician whose long-term disability ran out over a year ago has won $1 million from the Publishers Clearing House sweepstakes.

Karl Jonsson was home with his wife and teenage daughter on Tuesday when the Prize Patrol staff showed up and surprised him with roses and balloons, a large ceremonial check for $1 million and a real check for $25,000.

'You may get some phone calls from people you don't know,' Dave Sayer of Publishers Clearing House told him, 'but they'll be phone calls with congratulations and good wishes and, 'I'm just so glad to see a real person won, especially a person who could really use it.'

Overjoyed: Jonsson, an electrician, has been out of work for more than three years due to a string of injuries. He plans to use the money  to pay bills

Jonsson has been out of work for more than three years due to a string of injuries, Press-Gazette Media reported.

His family moved from Nebraska into his parents' home in rural Gresham when it was clear that a tear in his bicep tendon wasn't healing properly. 

Jonsson, his wife and two daughters have been living there for the past three years.

'Oh, man, it's, it's like a complete weight lifted off, and it couldn't be at a better time,' he said. 'It's been 3½ years since I've been off work. God knows what you need, and you just keep praying, and he hears and he answers.'

Jonsson said he plans to use the money — $1 million before taxes are deducted — to pay bills.
