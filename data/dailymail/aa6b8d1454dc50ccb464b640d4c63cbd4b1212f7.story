South Koreans are in the grip of a frantic hunt for chunks of meteor which could be worth more than £50,000 ($83,000).

Hundreds of people have been scouring hills and rice paddies for space souvenirs near the southeastern city of Jinju after the rare shower on March 9.

Some of the treasure hunters were armed with GPS devices and metal detectors, according to media reports.

South Koreans are in the grip of a frantic hunt for chunks of meteor which could be worth over £50,000 ($83,000). South Korean geologists are shown here surveying the area near where a chondrite (a type of meteorite) was found, in the southeastern city of Jinju

‘Media hype claiming that chondrites [a type of meteorite] could bring you a bonanza sparked the fever for space rocks,’ an official from the Cultural Heritage Administration of Korea (CHAK) told AFP.

Local greenhouse owners have put up signs warning off trespassers after the first large chunk of rock, weighing around 20lbs (9kg), was found in a greenhouse near Jinju.

A second piece weighing 8.8lbs (4kg) was found by another local resident.

Scientists confirmed that two rocks, found in the two days after the meteor shower, had come from space

Meteorites are typically sold by weight, but other factors come into play when putting a price tag on these space rocks.

Rarity of type, condition of preservation and its beauty can all change the price.

Prices vary from one source to another but it typically ranges between £3 ($5) to £6 ($10) per gram.

Unclassified stone chondrites, such as the ones found in South Korea, are at the bottom scale of the price range.

Pallasites, stony-iron meteorites, are more valuable, particularly when cut and polished because of their attractive colour.

Some can will fetch between $20 (£12) and $40 (£24) per gram. A quality slice the size of a small dinner plate is worth thousands of pounds.

Scientists confirmed that both rocks, found in the two days after the meteor shower, had come from space.

‘Because it is suspected that a meteorite divided in the atmosphere into more than two pieces, it is still possible that more meteorite [debris] will be discovered,’ said an official of the Korea Polar Research Institute (Kopri). However, an an official estimate has yet to be confirmed.

Treasure hunters hope they will sell any meteorites found for large sums.

The current going rate for meteors ranges betwee £3 ($5) to £6 ($10) per gram. The 20lb (9kg) rock found last week is expected to be worth up to $90,000 (£54,000).

A U.S. meteorite-hunter has been handing out business cards in the local area, asking people to sell him any shards they find, the Korea JoongAng Daily said.

Prime Minister Chung Hong-Won suggested the government should secure them for research or as a natural monument.

The current international standard is of £3 ($5) to £6 ($10) per gram. This 20lb (9kg) rock found last week is expected to be worth up to $90,000 (£54,000)

Ownership of the meteorites remains a legally grey area because of the lack of relevant provisions in South Korean civil law

Both space rocks were found in Jinju, a city in South Gyeongsang Province in South Korea

The CHAK official said the agency would designate any meteorites found as cultural assets to stop them from being taken out of South Korea.

Ownership of the meteorites remains a legally grey area because of the lack of relevant provisions in South Korean civil law, the official added.

A space rock was last found on its soil in 1943, when the Korean peninsula was under Japan's colonial rule.

Meteor showers occur when hundreds of meteors - fragments of dust and rock that burn up as they pass through the Earth's atmosphere - light up the sky in a spectacular display.

Meteorites are meteors that do not burn up completely, surviving the fall to Earth.

The second piece of space rock found weighed 8.8lbs (4kg) and was uncovered by a local resident in Jinju
