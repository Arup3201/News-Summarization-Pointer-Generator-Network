They may be one of the world’s best loved and most photographed supercars, but one man has captured Ferraris in a whole new way.

British artist Nick Veasey used a giant X-ray machine to show what’s inside a Ferrari, from its powerful engine to elegant interior.

He captured 10 of Ferrari’s most iconic models produced in the last 50 years, including a Ferrari 365 GTB/4 Daytona built in 1969.

To create his photograph, Mr Veasey X-rayed the cars using an extra-large machine at the Frauenhofer Institute in Fuerth, Germany.

The artist suspended the Daytona in the machine for three days, exposing it to a dose of radiation that would prove fatal to humans, Die Welt reported. 

It is possible to create 3D images and zoom in on details using the high-tech X-ray machine. It measures 1,312 square ft (400 square metres) and 45ft (14 metres) tall, according to Focus.

The Ferrari 365 GTB/4 is better known as the Ferrari Daytona.

It is one of the Italian car company's most iconic designs.

The grand tourer-style car produced between 1968 and 1973.

It is a traditional front-engined, rear-drive car with a 4.4 litre engine.

Brand new models have a top speed of 174mph (280kph) and can go from 0-60mph in 5.4 seconds.

The car was designed by Pininfarina, like many of Ferrari's most famous designs, but at the time, people said it looked more like Lamborghini.

Early models had fixed headlights behind an acrylic cover. After 1971 retractable pop-up headlights were introduced.

The Daytona has been voted the top sports car of the 1970s.

Inside the massive machine there are two 26ft (eight metre) high towers for the X-ray source and the detector.

Mr Veasey’s intention in creating the works are to show how things work and strip back objects from cars to clothes beyond their label.

He has previously X-rayed bikes, machinery, clothing, animals and unusual household objects to show them in a surprising way.

While none of the little details of the classic Ferrari, such as its prancing horse badge are captured in the image, it is immediately obvious to car fanatics that it is one of the famous Italian supercars.

Mr Veasey is interested in the superficiality of objects as well as what’s inside them.

‘We live in a world obsessed with image. What we look like what our clothes are like, houses cars...I like to counter this obsession with superficial appearance by using X-rays to strip back the layers and show what it is like under the surface,’ he writes on his website.

‘Often the integral beauty adds intrigue to the familiar. We all make assumptions based on the external visual aspects of what surrounds us and we are attracted to people and forms that are aesthetically pleasing. I like to challenge this automatic way that we react to just physical appearance by highlighting the often surprising inner beauty.’
