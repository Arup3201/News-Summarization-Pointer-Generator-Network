A mummified rat, dating back to the time when the Black Death ravaged Europe, has gone on display at a museum in Cornwall. 

The rat, which is said to have spent more than six centuries hidden behind the wall of a terraced house in Penryn, was discovered by builders during the late 1990s. 

And the museum believes the rodent may have been interred in the wall while still alive, to protect the home’s residents from the disease. 

The rat (pictured) was discovered in the late 1990s in Cornwall. It was originally found covered in black hair, which has since faded. It is said to be more than 650 years old, and experts believe it may have been interred while still alive, to protect the homeowners. But, no evidence of the disease was found on the rat’s body

However, no evidence of the disease was found on the rat’s body.

The mummified remains were found during renovations to the staircase at 107 The Terrace, Penryn. 

It was originally covered in black hair, but this  has faded since the rat was removed.

It is thought to have been mummified due to the dry conditions inside the cavity.

Typically, microorganisms ‘eat’ the body, causing it to decompose, but in certain conditions, these microorganisms die before they get the chance, meaning the bodies don’t decompose in the same way.

Following the discovery, the rat was taken to the Penryn Museum by builders J.R German and David Perry.

It was then sent to experts who determined the rat had been undisturbed since the 14th century. The project was overseen by historian Dr Jo Mattingly.

The rodent is thought to have been one of the millions of rats that spread the plague across Europe between 1346 and 1353.

And, scratch marks found on the inside of the cavity suggest it was still alive when it was placed inside the wall.

The dates, and these marks, led the museum to speculate that the homeowners deliberately interred it to protect them from the disease.

Centuries ago, cats were placed inside walls to ward off evil spirits, and the rat may have been placed in the cavity for a similar reason.

Another theory is that it simply got stuck behind the wall by accident. 

The specimen is on display inside a glass case at the Penryn Museum, whose staff describe it as a ‘prized treasure’ - despite its dark past.

The Black Death (illustrated) is thought to have killed between 75 and 200 million people across Europe i the mid-14th century. Recent analysis of DNA from victims indicated the pathogen responsible for the plague was the Yersinia pestis bacterium

The Black Death is thought to have killed between 75 and 200 million people across Europe during the mid-14th century. 

Recent analysis of DNA from victims indicated the pathogen responsible for the plague was the Yersinia pestis bacterium.

It is believed to have originated in central Asia, before reaching the Crimea by 1346. It then travelled across Europe until 1353.

Rats are thought to have carried infected fleas on merchant ships throughout the Mediterranean and Europe.

Research suggests it took 150 years for Europe's population to recover from the effects of the plague.

The perfectly preserved rodent is thought to have been one of the millions of rats that spread this disease.

It is currently on display at the Penryn Museum in Cornwall, whose staff describe is as a ‘prized treasure’ - despite its dark past.

The county was hit during the pandemic, with the town of Bodmin, in particular, losing 1,500 people - around half of its residents.

Museum co-ordinator Shirley Richards said: ‘It’s remarkable to find the skeleton exactly as it was after all this time. It’s still got its whiskers and its teeth.

‘Children find it fascinating and we consider it one of our most prized treasures - although we keep it in a box and don’t touch it.’

The museum recently celebrated gaining Full Accreditation from Arts Council England.

It also houses artefacts dating back to the back to the 1200s, including stonework from Glasney College, one of Cornwall’s most historic religious institutions.
