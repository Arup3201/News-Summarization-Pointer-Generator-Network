One of Bobbi Kristina Brown's neighbors reported a domestic dispute at her address the week before she was found face-down in a bathtub, according to a 911 call. 

It has been released, as a source close to the family rubbished reports that they were considering letting Miss Brown die today, which is the third anniversary of her mother's death.

In the call, made on January 23, a man who identified himself as a security guard at the gated community where Brown lives told a dispatcher that one of her neighbors reported a fight at the 21-year-old's address.

The guard said the neighbor reported people 'hitting each other and swinging' outside the three bedroom townhouse.

He did not give descriptions of how many people were fighting or who they were .

The ongoing investigation and limited details being provided in Miss Brown's case have fueled speculation about her condition and the circumstances that led to her hospitalization.

'We continue to request privacy in this matter,' Bobby Brown said in a statement released through his lawyer, Christopher Brown. 

'We thank everyone that supported the vigil for Bobbi Kristina. God is hearing our prayers.'

The lawyer criticized erroneous media reports about her condition while maintaining that details needed to be kept private.

'This is a criminal investigation and the integrity of that process requires silence,' he said.

Miss Brown's grandmother, Cissy Houston, was seen leaving her hospital yesterday evening smiling as she got into a waiting car. 

Previously it was reported that she had suggested the family turn off the machine so that the 21-year-old could be allowed to die today.

The daughter of the late Whitney Houston, and singer Bobby Brown, was found face down in a bath tub and was later discovered with bruises over her body and face. 

She has been in a medically induced coma in Atlanta ever since.  

Police have revealed few details about the circumstances of the case, citing an ongoing investigation.

Three years ago today, Whitney Houston, 48, died after being found unresponsive in a bath at the Beverley Hilton Hotel just before the Grammys.

Authorities concluded that she drowned.  

The ongoing investigation and limited details being provided in Bobbi Kristina Brown's case have fueled speculation about her condition and the circumstances that led to her hospitalization. 

The family of Bobbi Kristina Brown are reportedly considering switching off her life support today so she can die on the same date as her mother, Whitney Houston, who died on February 11, 2012

'This is a criminal investigation and the integrity of that process requires silence,' Brown said in the statement. 

Bruises were discovered on Miss Brown after she was admitted into hospital, sparking a police investigation into possible domestic abuse. 

But friends of the 21-year-old's boyfriend, Nick Gordon, claimed the marks on her chest were made as he tried to revive her.

Miss Brown was found face down in a bathtub of a home in the 9000 block of Riverbend Manor in Roswell, Georgia, more than a week ago,

The 21-year-old has been in a medically induced coma since January 31.

No charges have been filed in the case, but police are investigating suspected abuse and drug use.

They are also looking into suspicious injuries to Bobbi Kristina's face and mouth, reported WSB-TV

Brown's relatives have said Miss Brown is in a hospital 'fighting for her life.'

Documentary producer Daphne Barak, who is friends with Miss Browns boyfriend, Nick Gordon, said that he told her over the phone how he left marks on his girlfriend's chest while performing compressions in a desperate bid to revive her.

'Nick told me that the bruises were from his CPR,' Barak said, according to RadarOnline. 

Around 500 people gathered for the vigil earlier this week, singing gospel songs and saying prayers for the recovery of Miss Brown.

The vigil, which also include the recitation of passages from scripture, was led by Bishop Donald Battle.

Supporters of the Brown family, some of whom were in attendance, prayed and sang gospel songs together while waving flashlights in the air, asking God to perform a miracle for Bobbi.

Riverdale Mayor Evelyn Wynn-Dixon was among those who sang gospel hymns on stage, as members of the crowd sang and danced along.

Several vigil speakers touched on the struggles and scrutiny Brown's family has faced in recent years, comparing them to their own trials and tribulations.

'They bleed and hurt like us,' Wynn-Dixon told the crowd before singing the gospel song 'There's a leak in this old building.'

Brian and Poco Reese, both 52, of Johns Creek, Georgia, said they would make the roughly 40-mile drive back home feeling refreshed, uplifted and hopeful for Bobbi Kristina's recovery.'We just continue to pray that the Lord does his will and whatever that may be for Bobbi Kristina's life on Earth, we don't know that,' Brian Reese said.

'We watched her grow over the years. We love her,' Poco Reese added. 'You know, with everything she's gone through, with everything she's endured, we love her even more.' 

Bobbi's uncle, Tommy Brown, described the Monday night event to the New York Daily News as 'beautiful.'
