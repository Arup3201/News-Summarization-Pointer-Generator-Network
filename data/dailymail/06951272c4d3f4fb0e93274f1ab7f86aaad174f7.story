If you’ve ever had that sinking feeling you’ve left your cooker, hair straighteners or boiler on when leaving the house, a new app could put your mind at rest.

The Smart Power Strip is a multi-plug that can be used to power your home or office appliances and comes with built-in Wi-Fi.

It connects wirelessly to the Smart Power app and homeowners can switch appliances on and off at the swipe of the screen.

The Smart Power Strip connects with any Android and iOS devices, pictured, and will send notifications to warn users when a gadget has been left on. It also lets users switch off devices remotely, and the app can help users monitor the energy use in their homes in real-time too

The Smart Power Strip, pictured, is a multi-plug with built-in Wi-Fi.

It connects wirelessly to the Smart Power Android or iOS app and homeowners can switch appliances on and off remotely at the swipe of the screen.

The app will also send notifications to 
alert users if they’ve left a gadget or appliance switched on, and can be used to monitor a home’s energy use.

Elsewhere, a built-in timer lets homeowners set lights to come on and off automatically when they're on holiday, for example. 

The app will also send notifications to alert users if they’ve left a gadget or appliance switched on, and it can additionally be used to monitor a home’s energy use.

Created by California-based designer Roger Yiu, the prototype has three plug sockets but the final version is expected to have four.

Although the initial designs will be created for U.S. plugs, Yiu claimed he is working on an international version.

To fund his project, Yiu has set up a Kickstarter campaign and has currently achieved $58,000 (£35,000) of his $100,000 (£61,000) goal.

The campaign claims that other uses for the strip could be for parents to control how much TV their children watch in their bedroom, or to remotely switch off games consoles if the child won’t go to sleep.

The device is expected to retail at $199 (£121) if the project achieves funding by 16 December.

A built-in timer lets homeowners set lights to come on and off automatically when they're on holiday, for example, or can control the amount of TV their child watches. It could also be used to turn the washing machine or heater on before the user gets home

It could even be used to monitor if anyone uses a person’s computer without asking.

A built-in timer additionally lets users switch lights on and off while on holiday, for example, or set the washing machine or heater to turn on before they get home.

Elsewhere, the Strip is fitted with a power surge protector. A power surge is an increase in voltage above the set level in a flow of electricity.

In the U.S. the standard voltage is set at 120 volts. If the voltage rises above 120 volts in plugs on the Smart Power Strip the device will cut off power to that plug to prevent a fire, for example.

To fund his project, designer Roger Yiu has set up a Kickstarter campaign. Although the initial designs will be created for U.S. plugs, Yiu claimed he is working on an international version which will work with all household appliances. The strip is expected to retail at $199 (£121)

When an international plug is created, Yiu said he will change the set voltage levels accordingly.

The Smart Power Strip is just the latest in a line of smart devices being made for the home. A number of individual appliances already come with Wi-Fi built-in, for example.

In October, Nest Protect released a smart smoke alarm that gives a spoken Heads-Up warning that can be silenced by a wave of the 
hand before sounding a traditional warning alarm.

It can also be linked 
to mobile devices and can warn homeowners even when they're out.

There is also the August smart lock which can be used to open the front door of a house using Bluetooth, and users can also send virtual keys to visitors or if people get locked out.
