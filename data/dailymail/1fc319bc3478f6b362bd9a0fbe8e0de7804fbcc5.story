The world's oldest set of sisters have proved they are still young at heart as they celebrate reaching the landmark combined age of 386.

As Lillian Brown turned 103 on 23 January, she joked that she and her siblings - twins Dorothy Thompson and Ellen George, 96, and 'baby' of the family Sylvia Sturgess, 91 - would go clubbing.

The sisters, whose maiden name is Clarke, were raised in Northampton by their Victorian parents.

Incredibly, between them they have lived through 19 Prime Ministers, five monarchs and survived two world wars.

They have a total of six children, 14 grandchildren, 19 great-grandchildren and even one great-great-grandchild.

Three of the siblings, Lillian, Dorothy and Sylvia, all live in Market Harborough, Leicestershire, while Ellen lives 17 miles away in Northampton.

The lively pensioners also had a fifth sister called Gladys Merritt who died aged 85 in 2000 - and their mother Ellen Clarke lived until she was 102.

Lillian, who is known as Ann, celebrated her 103rd birthday at the home she shares with her only daughter Valerie Harrison, 75.

Lillian said that the secret to longevity was to remain positive and enjoy life.

She said: 'We just don't think about dying, just being cheerful and carrying on.

'We enjoy the odd tipple and always have a glass of wine whenever we meet up for a bit of a do.'

Lillian added that her age may make her less agile than she once was but she's still happy.  

'I've lost my independence and I do get a bit bored but apart from that, I'm quite happy to be 103.'

Lillian's daughter, Valerie, said she believed the sprightly sisters had all lived so long because they are 'feisty' women.

'They were talking about all going on to a nightclub after the party but they didn't do that in the end,' she said.

'They all worked independently. My mother's husband died when he was 40, so she took on the business herself.

'Then they're all very feisty and they speak their mind. They don't mince their words.

'And thirdly, they're all quite happy-go-lucky. They've all had sadness in their lives, but they always pick themselves up and get going again.'

Sylvia and Dorothy both live independently in the same sheltered housing block of flats near their sister Lillian's home in Market Harborough.

And the fourth sister Ellen, who wasn't able to make the birthday party, also lives independently in a retirement block in Northampton.

When they were younger, twins Dorothy and Ellen both worked in fashion and at clothing shops while Sylvia was a housewife. 

Lillian took over in business from her husband when he died aged just 40 and ran a pub as well as a greengrocers before going into property development.

Lillian says that despite her age making her less agile she is still thoroughly enjoying life 

Dorothy's daughter Carolyn Boddington, 67, said her mother and Auntie Sylvia still go out for a pub lunch together twice a week.

The retired admin worker, who lives nearby in Desborough, Northamptonshire, added that none of the women had let their age prevent them from having fun. 

'They are all very independent, they all have quite forceful personalities.

'Their mother was the driving force behind the family and I think they have just followed on from her.

'They enjoy their life and they are very determined to carry on living to the full.

'My mother and Sylvia still get a taxi and go out for a pub lunch twice a week, they like a good tipple. 

'They are quite thrilled about the record, the family are used to them being around but it is quite an achievement.'

The previous title for the world's oldest living siblings belonged to Jack Stepham, Clara Goldsmith, Belle Dell and Anne Goldsmith from the Stepham family in the UK.

Their combined age stood at 388 years before Jack, 94, was killed in September 2011.

The death means the Clarke sisters, whose combined age is 386, are the oldest living siblings in the world and they are now waiting on official confirmation.

A spokesperson for the Guinness World Records said: 'The record for the Highest combined age, four living siblings, is currently open due to the sad passing of Jack Stepham in 2011.

'We would ask that a record application to be made from a family member or someone on their behalf on the sisters in Harborough so our records team can look into this further.'
