Travel chaos today affected millions of motorists as Britain's roads were filled with those returning from Christmas breaks.

Although many workers will not return to their jobs until after the new year, huge numbers of Britons headed back to the office just two days after Christmas, as sales and disrupted rail services also led to severe congestion.

Traffic experts reported massive tailbacks and problems on parts of the M6 motorway in the West Midlands and North West, as well as the A1 in Yorkshire and the North East, the M1 in the South East and the M25 around London.

Tailback: On the M60 in the North West, there were similar scenes as the worst incidents saw traffic stretch back for miles

At lunchtime today, traffic images showed congestion stretching back for over 30 miles on one stretch of the M25 clockwise near Surrey.

On another section of the M25 traffic journeys were slowed by over an hour as slow traffic snailed back for 28 miles, with motorists battling to get in and out of the capital.

Meanwhile on the M6, the regularly-congested section of motorway north of Birmingham was again clogged up with motorists, many of whom were returning from Christmas breaks.

Further tailbacks of around 10 miles were reported on the M1 in Leicestershire, along with delayed journeys further north on the M60 and M62.

A spokesperson for the Highways Agency said today: 'We are seeing traffic levels on motorways and major A-roads increase after the Christmas break.

'We currently have some incidents and congestion on some of our routes, including the M1, the M25, the M6 and the A1. As always, we are doing all we can to clear these as quickly as possible.'

The increased congestion may also be due to the hugely reduced rail services currently running around the country.

Before Christmas, train services started to run down in advance of a complete shut-down of the rail network on the day itself, with services axed in most areas on Boxing Day, and a late start to a limited Bank Holiday service on Tuesday.

East Coast, Virgin West Coast, First Great Western, Northern Rail, Cross Country, South West trains andÂ  South Eastern are among those writing off the majority of Christmas with blank departure and arrivals boards.

The worst tailbacks on Britain's roads were on the nation's motorways, as motorists struggled in light of rail chaos.

The M25 suffered from slow traffic and congestion for 30 miles clockwise between junctions 7 and 15, while other sections of the motorway also endured tailbacks over 10 miles long.

The M6 suffered problems around Cannock between junctions 9 and 11 in both directions, while further up the same motorway in the north west there were also severe delays.

In the north west, the M60 and M62 were subject to heavy congestion, while back down in the south and east the M1 and M11 motorways were packed with motorists.

And many of those trains which do eventually run between Christmas and New Year will be subject to delays, diversions and cancellations caused by engineering works and the dreaded bus replacement services.

Noel Roman traveled from Castle Cary in Somerset to London's Paddington station on the first train of the day on Tuesday.

Fuming Noel, 30, said: 'I had to fight to get my reserved seat this morning, as the train was absolutely heaving.

'I sat for almost two hours with a suitcase on my lap while elderly women and children were forced to stand in the aisles - it was chaos.

'The buffet section closed early because the train was too busy and we had some heavy delays getting across the country.

'People were getting on and off at every station but once I actually got into London the traffic wasn't that bad - it was just getting towards the city that proved difficult.'

In Scotland, railway signal workers started a 72-hour strike yesterday in a dispute over career progression.

And to add to Britons' woes, Tube services were hit by striking Underground workers who wanted extra pay to work on Boxing Day.

An AA spokespersons said the return to work after Christmas was traditionally a time when they have to deal with a lot of breakdowns.

The spokesperson said the huge amount of traffic on the roads was also a result of the Boxing Day sales which started yesterday.
