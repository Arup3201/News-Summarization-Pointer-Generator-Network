A Florida mother was arrested after being filmed beating a 12-year-old girl in front of a crowd of students at her daughter’s school.

Irisdaly Rios, 35, fought Ashley Perez Tuesday outside Hialeah Middle School, after the two argued over the mother’s belief the young girl bullies her daughter.

The altercation was caught on a cell phone camera by student Damian Portal and put online by his mother – it resulted in Rios being arrested and charged with simple battery.

At odds: Irisdaly Rios, 35, faces assault and battery charges after being filmed Tuesday beating up 12-year-old Ashley Perez in front of a Florida middle school

Battered: The young girl's neck was scratched and she claims a tooth was broken in the melee

The video shows the woman pointing to her car, where her daughter is believed to have been sitting, and shouting at Perez.

The young girl shouts back, and then backs away from Rios before the irate mother loses her cool.

‘She got out of the car and saying 
she was going to hit or or whatever,’ Portal told CBS Miami of Rios. 
‘She started holding and touching her and then she backed away, she 
approached her and started swinging.’

Rios lunges forward, swinging at Perez, a loud smack is heard as the two women struggle, and the crowd keeps egging them on while shouting ‘child abuse’ and that Rios will be arrested.

An unidentified woman breaks the pair up before Rios goes back for more, this time punching the girl in the mouth.

The two are then broken up again as Perez is seen calling the police while Rios tries to fight through others to knock the phone out of the girl’s hand and the crowd further taunts her.

Heated conversation: Ashley Perez initially walked up to Irisdaly Rios' car thinking she could patch things up, but things quickly escalated

‘It was crazy,’ said Portal.

Rios claimed to NBC Miami that Perez ‘bullies my daughter every day.’

The young girl admitted to disagreements with Rios’ daughter, but says she only approached the car because she wanted to make things right.

‘She got aggressive, and I think she felt her daughter was in danger,’ the 12-year-old told NBC Miami.

That's why I walked to the car, because usually, if it was another mother, she'll be like, 'Oh, what's happening to my daughter. Let's fix this up.’

The young girl showed the station the scratch marks on her neck and said she has a broken tooth from being punched.

‘I've got scratches on my back, my tooth is broken, and my head started hurting a lot,’ she added.

Multiple witnesses told police Rios was the primary aggressor, according to CBS Miami. The video backs their claims.

Portal’s mother Marianne Daly uploaded the video to Facebook after she saw it because ‘everyone has to know what’s happening in school.

‘We can’t project violence,’ she told NBC Miami. ‘They have enough violence in video games, TV shows.  They don’t need that.’

Rios quickly posted her $1,500 bail and will see Perez again in court on a date to be determined.
