After weeks of leaking emails that painted top Hollywood executives as catty, crass and sometimes racist, posting highly guarded movie scripts online for public viewing, and ultimately threatening the possibility of a terrorist attack at theaters across America, North Korea today saw their quest to stop the release of the Kim Jong-un assassination film The Interview foiled as the film officially became available to rent or own online, one day before it hits theaters and video on demand.

It is a major victory for Sony considering all they had to go through just to get the film released, dealing with a massive hack that President Obama has called an act of 'cyber vandalism' on the part of North Korea.

After all that however, there seems to be yet another hurdle standing in the studio's way - the film Sony fought so hard to release is getting slammed by critics.

The reviews are in: Critics have begun releasing their reviews of The Interview, and they are not good

Harsh: Variety wrote of the film, 'North Korea is right to object'

Big day: This as the film was released online today, and will be in theaters and on video on demand on Thursday

Reviews of the film are slowly starting to pour in, and most critics are not impressed with the comedy, citing problems with everything from the plot to the acting and frequently comparing the massive studio film to an lackluster episode of Saturday Night Live. 

Variety critic Scott Foundas starts of his review by stating that 'North Korea is right to object' to the film, this before he goes on to warn readers eager to see the film that 'an evening of cinematic waterboarding awaits.'

That's not all either, as he also calls the picture 'about as funny as a communist food shortage,' and declares that 'America comes off looking at least as bad as the DPRK' in the film. 

Joe Morgenstern of the Wall Street Journal seems equally unimpressed, especially with star James Franco who, he notes; 'Mugs shamelessly to make sure we understand that he’s being funny, which he’s not.' 

As for the feel of the film, Morgenstern writes; 'Think Saturday Night Live on a really bad night.'

Though a bit more mixed in his review, The Hollywood Reporter's Todd McCarthy still declares the picture 'wildly uneven.'

He is however slightly kinder than Morgenstern in describing the feel of the film, which he believes 'has the comic batting average of a mediocre-to-average Saturday Night Live sketch.'

Stephanie Zacharek of The Village Voice notes that the film 'offers a few moments of casual brilliance,' but ultimately 'trips itself up in the threads of its contrived absurdity.'  

Sorry bud: James Franco is described in one review as not being funny

Almost every critic does however praise the performance of Randall Park, who plays Kim Jong-un in the film.

Park, perhaps best known for playing Danny Chung, the political rival of Julia Louis-Dreyfus' Selena Meyer on Veep, delivers a 'sympathetic' and 'complex' performance as the Supreme Leader according to Time's Richard Corliss.

He is also singled out by David Ehrlich of TimeOut, in a review that uses a now familiar comparison to describe the film.

'It’s Park’s performance that elevates the premise of a routine SNL sketch into the stuff of a compelling and genuinely radical feature, the actor portraying Kim as an endearingly deranged despot with nuclear daddy issues,' writes Ehrlich.

Praise: Despite the mixed to bad reviews, the performance of Randall Park as Kim Jong-un is uniformly praised by the critics

Seth Rogen, who not only stars in the film but also wrote and directed the picture alongside his childhood pal turned writing, directing and producing partner Evan Goldberg, also gets some love in a rave review from Tess Hoffmann at The Playlist, who compares The Interview to the last film he and Goldberg wrote and directed, the critically praised disaster comedy This Is the End.

'Goldberg and Rogen navigate this minefield of prurient humor and political incorrectness with aplomb, delivering a high-concept spy thriller comedy that feels as carefree as This Is the End while managing not to ruin the thrills by too clumsily dumbing down the realities the film plays with,' writes Hoffmann.

The film also got high marks from Rolling Stone critic Peter Travers who praised both Rogen and Franco's work in the picture while also applauding the comedy's 'bad taste.'

Writes Travers; 'The Interview hits the sweet spot for raunchy fun and spiky lampooning because Franco and Rogen are effing hilarious and fearless about swinging for the fences.'

History repeating: Many reviews also make mention of the 2004 film Team America: World Police, which was a satire about Kim Jong-il, the father of Kim Jong-un, and also ended with his death

It is also worth noting that more than a few critics make mention of the last film to mock a North Korean leader, the Matt Parker and Trey Stone comedy Team America: World Police, which told the story of a paramilitary anti-terrorism force based out of Mount Rushmore who were tasked with stopping a terrorist plot crafted by Kim Jong-un's father, former North Korean leader Kim Jong-il.

The film is remarkably similar to The Interview in its ridiculous characterization of the villain, in this case Kim Jong-il, and also ends with the death of the North Korean leader.

Unlike The Interview though, the characters in Team America are all marionettes and not actual actors. 

That film  was released in 2004 to no real controversy, save an order from Kim Jong-il that  the Czech Republic to ban the film.

The Czech Republic refused his request.
