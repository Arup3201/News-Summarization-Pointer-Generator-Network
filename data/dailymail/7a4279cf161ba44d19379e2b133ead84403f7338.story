German Chancellor Angela Merkel has refused to accompany China's president Xi Jinping on a visit to Berlin's Holocaust memorial, it was reported today.

The German Chancellor is said to fear that a tour with President Xi would be used as propaganda in an ongoing fight with Japan over crimes committed in  China during World War II.

President Xi is due to visit Berlin at the end of March and his aides specifically requested an official tour of the standing stones near the Brandenburg Gate which commemorate the six million Jews murdered by the Nazi regime.

Denied: President Xi Jinping's wish for Angela Merkel to accompany him to the Holocaust memorials in Berlin during his official visit, was declined

His wish was declined by Merkel’s office as well as a request for her to accompany Xi to the Memorial to the Victims of Fascism and Militarism on the Unter den Linden.

President Xi's official tour of Second World War memorial sites in Germany is intended to be used to highlight how Japan fails to atone for their crimes during World War II, compared to Germany, and to embarrass Japanese officials, the Telegraph reports.

Spiegel magazine reported the snub this week stating: ‘The German government, Berlin sources told Spiegel, wants to avoid becoming involved in the tiff over history currently straining relations between Beijing and Tokyo.

Government sources said that Xi was: 'Of course, welcome to visit World War II memorials on his own time.’

China suffered greatly under the Japanese invasion of its territory before WW2 broke out in Europe.

No-go area: President Xi's aides specifically requested an official tour of the standing stones near the Brandenburg Gate, Berlin, but will have to walk alone

A allied military tribunel concluded that 142,000 were killed, a number which the Chinese more than doubles, claiming that 300,000 people died.

China has repeatedly castigated Japan for not showing the same contrition for war crimes that Germany has expressed since 1945 for its atrocities under Nazism.

Although Tokyo has repeatedly apologized for the suffering caused in China during the war, the periodic visits by Japanese leaders to the Yasukuni Shrine, a memorial which honours wartime leaders, continues to irritate Beijing.

Japanese Prime Minister Shinzo Abe last visited the shrine at the end of December.

An unnamed German diplomatic source said: ‘The Germans are really uncomfortable with this kind of thing. They don't like China constantly comparing them with Japan and going on about the war.

'Mrs. Merkel doesn't want to be a pawn in any propaganda war.’
