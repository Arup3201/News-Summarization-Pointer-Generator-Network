Hillary Clinton's second memoir, Hard Choices, has sold a dismal 160,000 copies, data released by Nielson BookScan today indicates.

By comparison Clinton's book Living History sold 600,000 copies in a single week when it was released in 2003, leading publishing group Simon & Schuster to believe Hard Choices would be a hit.

But sales of the book continue to plummet, and it looks increasingly unlikely bookstores will be able to sell the million hard copies the publishing group distributed to them when the book dropped earlier this month.

Who wants to buy one?: Hillary Clinton carries around a copy of her memoir at an Arkansas Wal-Mart during a book signing there last Friday night

From the beginning Clinton's book has struggled to gain the necessary traction to meet the enormous expectations in sales thrust upon it by publishers.

Sellers reported 
moving only a 85,000 copies the first week it was available in stores. From there, it was all downhill, with the book selling only 48,000 
copies it's second week on the shelf, a 43.5 percent drop from the week previous.

Last week the book sold a dismal 26,000 copies.

Total sales for the book are unavailable, as recent ebook sales have not been disclosed, but roughly 15,000 digital copies of the book were known to have been bought the first week.

When asked about the unexpected unpopularity of Hard Choices, a spokesman for publishing company wrote off the memoir's shaky start.

'It
 will be selling for years — in hardcover, e-book, audio and paperback —
 and we expect it to be a successful book for Simon & Schuster as 
well as our many international partners,' Simon & Schuster spokesman Cary Goldstein told the Washington Post last week.

'Most 
importantly, reader reaction has been terrific.'

Initial sales usually account for 30 percent of a book's total sales, 
meaning Clinton's book would have needed to sale 300,000 copies in the 
first week to stay on schedule.

Reader reaction hasn't been quite up to snuff, either.

The book has received 1,165 reviews on Amazon and only 276 of them have been marked with the coveted five star label.

A large majority of reviewers gave the book one star, with users frequently complaining that the book was a waste of money.

'What
 a waste of paper. Or for Kindle/Nook readers, screen space. What was 
Simon and Schuster thinking when they paid her? Not profits for sure,' 
Virginia resident George V. Caylor commented yesterday.

'Too
 bad kindle books can't be used for toilet paper. One star is five too 
many for this book. Avoid like a plague,' Cornith, Texas, resident D. L.
 White said of the book on Monday.

'No
 matter how you feel about Hillary, this book is boring and very poorly 
written. It's not worth reading unless you need something to put you to 
sleep,' a user name Richard wrote on June 21.

'This
 book was one of the worst books I've ever read. I wanted to like it but
 in the end, I ended-up stabbing myself in the face with a fork because 
of it. There's nothing new in the book thus simply recycled boredom 
all-the-way-around,' said another user on June 21.

'Good God-- most boring thing I have ever
 attempted to read. If she had any integrity, she would refund her 
advance,' an user named Druanne wrote on Amazon yesterday.

Clinton's advance for the book is unknown, however, it is rumored to be north of the $8 million she was paid for Living History.

That book ended up selling 1.4 million copies.

After traveling across the U.S. to promote Hard Choices for the better part of June, Clinton will travel to Europe later this week for the second leg of her tour.

There, publisher's hope her book will see a rebound in sales.

'We can think of no other recent book 
written by an American leader to receive such an enthusiastic 
international reception,' Jonathan Karp, president and publisher of 
Simon & Schuster, said in a statement last week.
