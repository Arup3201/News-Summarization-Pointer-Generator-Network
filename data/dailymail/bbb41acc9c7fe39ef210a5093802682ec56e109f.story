Desperation: Ruth Madoff, wife of disgraced financier Bernie, has spoken for the first time about the night she leaned of her husband's massive Ponzi fraud

Madoff is serving a 150-year-sentence for his $65 billion Ponzi scheme fraud.

His wife's interview with '60 Minutes' will be broadcast Sunday. The Madoffs' son, Andrew, also appears on the same show in interview.

Meanwhile Bernie Madoff says that he is happier in prison than he was been for the past 20 years.

Happier than the past 20 years: Bernard Madoff told Barbara Walters that he has learnt to live with the anger of his fraud victim

Madoff claims that he suffers 
deep remorse and endures 'horrible' nightmares, but in comments that
 are likely to enrage his victims further he said: 'Every once in a 
while I find myself smiling and I find myself horrified'.

In a two-hour jailhouse interview with Barbara Walters, Madoff revealed that he was forced to 'let... go' of his wife almost a 
year ago.

He said that whilst he can live with the anger of his victims, being shunned by his own family is too much to bear.

The disgraced financier revealed that Mrs Madoff, 68, has not spoken to him since the suicide last December of their son Mark.

When that happened she asked him to 'let her go'.

Madoff, 73, said that 'not seeing my 
family and knowing they hate me' is the worst thing about being in 
prison because he 'betrayed them'.

He said: 'Ruth not communicating is the hardest thing. Ruth doesn't hate me. She has no-one.

'It's not fair to her. She lost her first son. ... She is a devoted wife and didn't care about the money.'

Talking of his life in prison, he told ABC News: 'I feel safer here than outside.

'Days go by. I have people to talk to and no decisions to make. ... I know that I will die in prison.

'I lived the last 20 years of my life 
in fear. Now I have no fear - nothing to think about because I'm no 
longer in control of my own life.'

He added:  'I deserved to be punished. I 
deserved to go to jail.'

Asked what he'd like to say to his grandchildren, he said: 'I am sorry to have caused them pain.'

Penthouse: Madoff's security guard said he spent the early evening sitting talking with them both and 'didn't see anything unusual' before leaving at 7pm

Attempt: Mrs Madoff claimed in an interview that she and her husband formed a suicide pact and took an overdose of sedatives on Christmas Eve 2008 at their apartment in New York

Barbara
 Walters reported that during the interview, which was not allowed to be 
filmed, Madoff, who was wearing the standard prison uniform of a khaki 
shirt and pants, had an occasional tick, blinking of the eyes, which got
 worse when he was discussing 'difficult matters'.

The interview came hot on the heels of allegations that Ruth
 Madoff could be lying about her claim that she and Bernie Madoff tried 
to kill themselves.

Their security guard Nick Casale said he was in the couple's home on the night they supposedly attempted an overdose and everything seemed normal.

Mr Casale spent the early evening sitting talking with them both and 'didn't see anything unusual' before leaving at 7pm.

His claims were bolstered by Madoff 
biographer Andrew Kirtzman who said Mrs Madoff's 'disclosure' could be 
part of a PR campaign to counter the negative publicity against her.

Revelations: Stephanie Madoff Mack, the Madoffs' daughter-in-law has released a book about life inside the family

He said: 'She's trying to get the American public to see her as a sympathetic figure for the first time'.

Mrs Madoff claimed in an interview 
that she and her husband formed a suicide pact and took an overdose of 
sedatives on Christmas Eve 2008 whilst he was awaiting justice for his 
$60billion Ponzi scheme.

But their plan did not work and they woke up the next morning unharmed.

Mrs Madoff's claims were her first 
public comments on her life with Bernie and come after the publication 
of a highly critical memoir by her daughter-in-law Stephanie Madoff 
Mack, who was married to Mark Madoff.

The incident supposedly took place whilst her husband was under house arrest in his New York penthouse apartment.

But Mr Casale, a former NYPD detective who was assigned to him by the courts in New York, disputed this.

Unable to cope: Mark Madoff hanged himself in his Manhattan apartment last December while his young son slept in the next room 

He told ABC News that that evening he was 'sitting there with them talking I didn't see anything unusual'.

Mrs Madoff claimed that at some point 
that night she and her husband swallowed a large number of sedatives and
 lay down next to each other, expecting to die.

She
 told 60 Minutes: ‘I don’t know whose idea it was, but we 
decided to kill ourselves because it was so horrendous what was 
happening.

'We had terrible phone calls. Hate mail, just beyond anything and I said: 'I just can't go on anymore.'

'I took what we had, he took more,' adding that the fact it was Christmas Eve 'added to the whole depression'.

But the plan did not work. She said: ‘We took pills and woke up the next day… It was very impulsive and I am glad we woke up’.
