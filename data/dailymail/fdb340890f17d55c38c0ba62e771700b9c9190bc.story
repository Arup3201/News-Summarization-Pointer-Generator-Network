Arnold Ferrier is a man who openly admits he’s rather admiring of what he sees in the mirror. And so he should.

For the 45-year-old IT executive has a grooming ritual on a par with that of a supermodel — he works out every day and refuses to drink alcohol or eat carbohydrates on week days.

But he also has another beauty secret, one done in private behind the bolted bathroom door of the four-bedroom home he shares with his fiancee and her young son in Hove, West Sussex.

45-year-old IT executive, Arnold Ferrier, started shaving his chest two years ago and he's not the only one, a study by Mintel last year found that 13 per cent of men have removed their chest hair

Every week, he spends the best part of an hour shaving his chest. First he washes the area with one of his favourite upmarket soaps, then he applies some L’Oreal For Men shaving foam and removes the offending hair with a razor. Afterwards, he lovingly massages in a post-shave healing lotion before applying tinted moisturiser.

While such a routine might sound peculiar for a heterosexual father-of-two, for Arnold it’s a luxurious moment of ‘me’ time that he wouldn’t be without.

‘When I dress after having shaved my chest,’ he says, ‘I can only describe it as the wonderful feeling you get when you’ve changed your bed sheets and then slip into them or stay in a posh hotel with fabulous Egyptian-cotton bed linen. When your smooth, hairless skin touches crisply ironed natural fabric, it’s the most wonderful sensation, there’s nothing like it.’

Men with smooth chests such as David Beckham (pictured), Cristiano Ronaldo and Tom Cruise are now held up as style icons rather than their hirsute counterparts of the 20th century

Not only do Arnold’s two teenage children find his habit ridiculous, but so does his fiancee Laura. Indeed, she says, if she’d discovered how obsessed he was with his grooming habits at their first meeting a year ago, there wouldn’t have been a second.

‘When I found out I was absolutely horrified,’ remembers 40-year-old Laura, a sleep counsellor and mother to Joe, seven. ‘We laugh about it now but I was quite disgusted at the time.

‘When we first got intimate, my initial reaction was to recoil in horror. At the gym, the guys like that are a total turn-off. They look so vain — they’re always admiring themselves in the mirror.

‘I’ve had to accept that Arnold is exceedingly vain. It’s pointless me trying to stop him indulging in his grooming habits. It’s constant, I do come second place to his reflection.’

Rather worryingly for those who cling to the idea that a hairy chest is a sign of virility, Arnold isn’t an anomaly. Indeed, it’s part of a growing trend among middle-aged men. Researchers even have a term for it — ‘manscaping’.

A study by Mintel last year found that 13 per cent of men have removed their chest hair and one-in-five feel expected to remove hair from their torso.

Bernadette Harte, non-surgical training manager at The Harley Medical Group, puts this down to the 2012 Olympics: ‘Suddenly ordinary men were constantly exposed to athletic, fit and hairless bodies. They wanted to emulate them. They started working out and removing body hair too.’

Indeed, it seems no British male is immune to temptation — the survey found 22 per cent of over-65s felt pressure to remove or groom body hair.

Perhaps it’s no wonder. Men with smooth chests such as David Beckham, Cristiano Ronaldo and Tom Cruise are now held up as style icons rather than their hirsute counterparts of the 20th century.

Indeed Arnold cites Ronaldo as his icon. ‘When you look at the chests of today,’ he claims, ‘Ronaldo is the ultimate pin-up. It’s completely clear of hair and extremely well-toned and sculpted. He’s like a Greek God.’

Arnold started shaving his chest two years ago, after coming out of a seven-year relationship, and denies it’s in any way narcissistic.

‘With all of the stress involved [in the break-up], I’d let myself go,’ he says. ‘One of my goals was to get in shape. There’s no better indicator of being on the road to success at 45 than if you can see your abs in the mirror. I was hairy — it was hiding what was underneath. That was a motivating factor to start shaving, so that I could see the improvements under the hair.’

While Arnold denies he’s undergoing a mid-life crisis, Bernadette Harte believes that this is often the case for 40-something men.

‘If a chap is back on the market then the last thing he wants to see is grey hairs on his chest. If they’re already discreetly dying their hair then they’ll remove the give-away ageing signs on their chest. ‘Society has moved on — they read the magazines, they go to the gym, they even talk to each other about it. Men today don’t want to look younger, they want to look good for their age.’

Daniel Remon, 40, a building engineer and stepfather to four children aged 15 to 26, has been shaving his chest and legs since his late teens. ‘I was 12 when I developed a moustache,’ says Daniel, who lives with his wife Jacqui in Symonds Yat, Herefordshire. ‘It was always commented on in the changing rooms that I was really hairy. I was teased relentlessly.

‘When I reached my late teens, someone dared me to shave off all of my hair. I thought it looked quite neat, I enjoyed the sensation of having smooth, hair-free skin. That’s why I carried on doing it.’

Even so, until recently it’s a habit that he’s kept to himself.

‘There has been a social prejudice that men can’t do this kind of thing. Girlfriends in the past couldn’t stand it and it has ended relationships. One in particular couldn’t come to terms with me preferring to be hairless.

‘Even my 15-year-old stepson called me “gay” and said I’m “bizarre” when he found out I shaved everywhere. But I’d rather be smooth than hirsute.’

Jacqui, a 52-year-old writer, is accepting of his habit. ‘I know a lot of men in their 40s and 50s who do it and they’re all normal blokes in normal jobs. It’s not just for metrosexuals or gay men any more. Among my social circle are men who are quite vain — they dress nicely, do their nails and look after themselves. Dan is vain, I’ve come to accept that.’

As with Daniel, 48-year-old Chris Nurding’s trigger to shave his chest also came about in his teens, but for a far more serious reason.

‘I was 18 and I’d just passed my driving test when I was involved in a horrific car accident. I spent months in hospital.

‘When I was discharged, I was just 6st. At 5ft 11in I was desperately underweight and part of my rehabilitation included physiotherapy and weights.

‘I got into developing my chest and to chart my progress it was a natural step for me to shave. It made a difference seeing the skin and muscle tone develop.

‘It was 1985 and that kind of behaviour for a man wasn’t the norm. I did keep quiet about it. Everyone would snigger at oily, hair-free bodybuilders. I certainly didn’t want to be mocked either.’

The property developer, who lives with partner Kristina Papapetrou, 43, an art therapist, in Barnet, North London, has continued his habit to this day, relying on an electric razor to shave both his head and chest once a week.

‘While I keep in shape, I don’t go to the gym any more, but I still like to shave my chest. If I’m renovating a property, it’s often too hot with body hair. I genuinely think I look better without a hairy chest. Women prefer it, too. In my experience, not many women like rugs.’

Chris’s partner Kristina discovered by surprise that Chris shaved his chest when they were on holiday. ‘I thought it was really lovely he took pride in how he looked. I enjoy dressing up, putting on make-up, ensuring my hair looks nice for Chris and I like that he takes an interest in himself for me too.

‘Chris feels good about himself and more confident. It’s a good thing for middle-aged men to do.’
