Dating: Katherine Jenkins with boyfriend Adam Bidwell at Royal Ascot

Katherine Jenkins is dating a friend of Prince Harry who joined the royal on his notorious Las Vegas holiday.

The Welsh mezzo-soprano, 33, and Adam Bidwell have been an item since February after being introduced by friends.

Mr Bidwell, 37, enjoyed a pool party with Harry and a group of girls during the prince’s ‘lads’ holiday’ to Las Vegas last August. On the same holiday Harry was pictured cavorting with a girl as they played ‘naked billiards’ in his hotel suite.

Cambridge graduate Mr Bidwell is a former Wasps and London Welsh rugby player turned stockbroker.

He and Miss Jenkins – who formerly dated TV presenter Gethin Jones – were pictured together last  month at Ascot and the Glastonbury Festival.

A friend of the pair said: ‘They were introduced through a mutual friend and remained friends for quite a few months before they realised they had lots in common. Adam’s a very nice chap. He’s a good catch.

‘Everybody likes Adam especially because he is successful in his own right and not interested in Katherine’s spotlight.’

He looked relaxed when Miss Jenkins sat confidently on his knee backstage at the Glastonbury Festival last month.

The second son of solicitor Christopher Bidwell, Adam was born into a happy middle class family from West Sussex and attended St Christopher preparatory school in Hove before becoming a day boy at £31,000-a-year Brighton College.

Always a keen sportsman Mr Bidwell was also an able and hard-working student and won a place at Cambridge University. 

After graduating he played rugby first for London Welsh and later Wasps as well as working in the City of London. He is now a senior account manager at City stockbrokers Investec.

And it was rugby – and his best friend former England fly-half Alex King - that led him into the celebrity circles where he mixes today.

A friend told the Daily Mail: ‘It’s through Alex that he’s been introduced to celebrities and people like that in London.

‘He’s
 been a semi-professional rugby player since the early 1990s and he was 
part of that Brighton and Hove upper-middle class set growing up.

‘He’s a very likeable person and has always been popular with the girls. He’s always been a gentlemen and very nice chap. He’s always well turned out and smartly dressed.

‘He has a wealthy background but he doesn’t flaunt his wealth - he never has. 

‘He’s a typical, competitive blokey bloke, which is definitely something that transcends into his professional life. He’s a high achiever who doesn’t settle for second best.’

Last year Miss Jenkins revealed she received death threats over false rumours that she had an affair with David Beckham.

The singer took to Twitter in August to tell more than 228,000 followers around the world that she ‘absolute denied’ the ‘hurtful and untrue’ claims of a relationship with the married footballer.

Many fans pointed out that such a public statement only attracted more attention to the allegations - but Miss Jenkins has now revealed she felt she had to take a stand because of ‘constant’ online abuse.
