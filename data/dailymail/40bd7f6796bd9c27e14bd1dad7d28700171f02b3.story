Rio Ferdinand admits that he has had to completely change his mindset from enjoying a trophy-laden career at Manchester United to facing a relegation fight with QPR.

The former England defender won the Champions League and six Premier League titles before leaving Old Trafford after 12 years this summer.

Ferdinand has already suffered a 4-0 defeat on his return to United as QPR have dropped into the relegation zone after six games, and the 35-year-old believes that simply staying in the top-flight would rank alongside his greatest achievements.

‘Going into QPR I knew it was going to be a huge adjustment in terms of mindset and expectations,’ he said.

‘We’re not going for the Champions League places or winning the league. Staying in the Premier League is our main aim. That will be a huge achievement for me at this stage of my career.

‘It’s different. It’s not what I’m used to but I knew going in the door what the aims were going to be so I didn’t set my stall out any higher or lower than that.’

Reflecting on the highs and lows of his time at United, Ferdinand spoke about the shock of Sir Alex Ferguson’s retirement and the unforgettable experience of winning the Champions League against Chelsea in 2008.

‘It was a shock,’ he said. ‘We walked in the morning and we were all in debating it. Then a meeting got called at 9am and the manager told us.

‘He was disappointed it got leaked before he could tell us and he was looking around and seeing the lads faces and everyone saying “no chance”. I looked at Robin van Persie, who just signed from Arsenal, just won his first league title and just seeing the disbelief and the disappointment.

‘We all respected his decision, he did so much for the club and for us as individuals as well.’

On United’s penalty shootout win over Chelsea in Moscow, Ferdinand added: ‘It’s something you think is too far away to touch. You think I’ll never get there.

‘I’d lost in a semi final for Leeds, lost in quarter-finals. I just thought I’d never get close enough. Then that day was a ridiculous feeling. If you could bottle the emotions on that night you’d make a lot of money.

‘I was gone (in the shootout). Giggs scored as usual. If you see the pictures from behind, I’m telling Edwin (Van der Sar) to go whichever way it was. Luckily Edwin didn’t see me and dived the other way and saved it and the rest is history.

‘I could feel my legs as if to say, “whoa, I’m next up how am I going to even walk up and take a penalty?”. I don’t know if I could have hit the ball. I was so scared and nervous.’

Giggs was caretaker boss for Ferdinand’s last game for United at Southampton in May when he was informed by Old Trafford chief Ed Woodward in the dressing-room afterwards that he would not be getting a new contract.

Asked if Giggs will make a top manager in the future, Ferdinand pointed to some of the problems encountered by another of his old teammates Roy Keane at Sunderland and Ipswich as proof that success on the pitch is not easy to reproduce from the dugout.

‘Nothing is a given in this game,’ he said. ‘Roy Keane was a great leader, a great captain and he’s assistant manager now at Aston Villa. He had a few sticky roles in management and he’ll be looking to come back and take over a club.

‘So it doesn’t always mean you’re guaranteed immediate success. Ryan Giggs is doing it a real good way in that he’s learning, he’s played under Sir Alex and David Moyes. And now, Louis van Gaal. He’s got a great track record and learning and honing his craft. I’m sure one day he’ll get the opportunity and then he’s got to execute.’

Asked how he would like to be remembered by his teammates, Ferdinand said: ‘As a footballer when you set out you want to be respected by your teammates.

‘You want them to say yes he was a good player, he was an integral part of the team. Obviously I like a laugh so they’d probably chuck that in as well.’
