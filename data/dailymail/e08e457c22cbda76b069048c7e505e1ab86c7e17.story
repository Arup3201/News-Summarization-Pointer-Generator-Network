Sri Lanka's police have arrested 37 nationals, turned back by Australian authorities on the high seas after attempting to seek asylum.

Superintendent Ajith Rohana said Australia's coastguard intercepted the trawler carrying the Sri Lankans near the Indonesian coast, before handing the asylum-seekers over to Sri Lanka's navy on Thursday.

'The boat left Sri Lanka on November 1,' Rohana said, adding that six children were among the passengers.

'Investigations are being conducted by the anti-people smuggling unit of the CID (Criminal Investigation Department),' Rohana said. 'They are being held in custody, but will be taken before a magistrate shortly.'

The asylum-seekers are the first group to be turned back by the Australian Navy since July, when a boat with 41 Sri-Lankan nationals was intercepted west of the Cocos (Keeling) Islands. Sri Lanka has since charged them with illegally leaving the country and their cases are due to be taken up in court next May.

PM Tony Abbott came to power in September last year vowing to stop asylum-seekers undertaking dangerous voyages on rickety boats to reach Australia. 

As part of its hard-line border protection policy, Australia has since gifted two former customs vessels to Sri Lanka to help its navy stop boats leaving the island's shores.

Australia faces international criticism over its treatment of boat people, who are denied resettlement in Australia and sent to camps in Papua New Guinea and the Pacific state of Nauru.
