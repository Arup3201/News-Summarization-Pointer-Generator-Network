Sean Dyche expects Ashley Barnes to react well to the furore caused by his clash with Nemanja Matic and hopes the striker will not change his combative playing style.

The Burnley forward was widely condemned after catching Matic on the shin with his studs during last weekend's 1-1 draw at Stamford Bridge.

Matic was sent off for his furious reaction, with Chelsea boss Jose Mourinho branding the challenge 'criminal' and arguing it could have ended his player's career.

Barnes is known for his physical style of play and has committed more fouls this season than any other player in the Premier League.

Dyche said of the 25-year-old: 'He's been good (this week). It's not the ideal situation. We know how things get blown up very quickly at this level and particularly when powerful people in the game give big opinions on situations, the media run with it.

'It's an interesting part of his learning curve. It's not something that's come his way before, I'm pretty sure of that, but he's a steady lad, he's been doing tremendously for us.

'The lads obviously are all round that situation, as are the staff, so onwards and upwards for him.

'I hope that he just plays with the freedom he has been. That's it in a nutshell.'

Matic was show a straight red card for his reaction, his three-game ban was reduced to two after an appeal  

Chelsea's anger was only compounded when the Football Association announced it would not be punishing Barnes retrospectively, leaving him free to play against Swansea this weekend.

Matic, meanwhile, saw his ban reduced from three matches to two on appeal but will miss Sunday's Capital One Cup final.

Asked about Barnes escaping sanction, Dyche said: 'There's no relief in it. The powers that be make decisions so I leave them to do their job.'
