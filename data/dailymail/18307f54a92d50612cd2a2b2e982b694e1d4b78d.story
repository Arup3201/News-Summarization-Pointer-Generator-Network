A hip Japanese cafe is giving customers a chance to make sweet-sized gummy replicas of themselves to give to women they have a crush on.

The Fab Cafe in Shibuya, Tokyo, is offering the unique service for the upcoming White Day on March 14, when men traditionally give presents to their lovers.

For around £40 (6,000 yen) customers will have their bodies mapped using a 3D scanner, with the resulting file used to 3D print a mould for the one-of-a-kind product.

And they call it gummy love... A Japanese cafe 
is offering male customers the chance to have themselves moulded as gummy-bear like sweets to give to their lovers on White Day

Bowled over: On White Day, men and boys in Japan
and other East Asian countries offer gifts in return to women and girls
who have given them presents for Valentine's Day

The same establishment previously held a successful Valentine's Day event where ladies were invited to create a chocolate replica of their face to give to their partners.

In Japan, Valentine's Day is typically observed by girls and women presenting chocolate gifts to boys or men as an expression of love, courtesy, or social obligation.

On White Day, the reverse happens. Men who received a honmei-choco ('chocolate of love') or giri-choco ('courtesy chocolate') on Valentine's Day are expected to give gifts in return.

The name of the Fab Cafe, which opened last year in Tokyo's fashionable and vibrant Shibuya district, has something of a double meaning.

One the one hand, it is, obviously, a contraction of the word fabulous; but it is also a less obvious contraction of the word fabrication.

Two day workshop: For around £40 (6,000 yen) customers will have their bodies first mapped using a 3D scanner, then the resulting file will be used to 3D print a mould for the one-of-a-kind product

High demand: Spaces for the workshop are strictly limited

That's because the tiny coffee shop is equipped with a powerful laser cutter which any customer can use for a fee to cut out designs in Adobe Illustrator files.

It also has 3D printers and other tools that designers can use to quickly prototype designs and products.

The gummy bear workshop takes place over two sessions. The first, this Saturday, will be for men to come in and have their bodies 3D scanned in whatever pose they choose.

By the next session, a week later, Fab Cafe staff will have 3D printed the moulds for the gummy gifts and returning customers will be able to make their gummy counterparts to take to their White Day sweethearts.

Designers' hangout: The Fab Cafe, which opened last year in Tokyo's fashionable and vibrant Shibuya district, has a laser cutting machine and 3D printers that customers can use for a fee

A post on the cafe's site reads (courtesy of Google Translate): 'We have prepared a plan to use high-spec 3D printers, 3D scanners again, they make a gummy whole body of you who do not lose the impact of the chocolate face.

'Please try to express the feelings of loved ones with the whole body.'

Spaces are strictly limited. If you happen to be reading from Tokyo, you can sign up here.
