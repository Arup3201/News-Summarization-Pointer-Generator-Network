WNBA star Brittney Griner has written a book about her struggles as a lesbian at Baylor University and how she was warned by her coach to keep ‘her business’ to herself and warned not to express her sexuality in public.

Baylor University is a rigidly Baptist university in Texas that discourages students from participating in 'advocacy groups which promote understandings of sexuality that are contrary to biblical teaching.'

In her book In My Skin, Griner writes that she was open with Coach Kim Mulkey even before she joined the team.

WNBA star Brittney Griner has written a book about her struggles as a lesbian at Baylor University and how she was warned by her coach to keep 'her business' to herself and warned her not to express her sexuality in public

‘Big Girl, I don’t care what you are,’ Griner recalls Mulkey as saying. ‘You can be black, white, blue, purple, whatever. As long as you come here and do what you need to do and hoop, I don’t care.’

Griner, who is currently playing in China during the WNBA offseason, writes that while she never promoted her sexuality at Bayer, she never hid it, either.

She believes the university was conveniently hypocritical about their views on student’s sexuality when it suited them - such as when it came to attracting talented sports stars.

‘The more I think about it, the more I feel like the people who run the school want it both ways: they want to keep the policy, so they can keep selling themselves as a Christian university, but they are more than happy to benefit from the success of their gay athletes. That is, as long as those gay athletes don’t talk about being gay,’ she wrote.

Griner was a three-time AP all-American who is the NCAA’s all-time leader in blocked shots, and led the Lady Bears to the 2012 national title.

Last year she was named 'Best Female College Athlete' for her 2012-13 season at Baylor at the ESPY Awards, just weeks after officially coming out as gay - ahead of the WNBA draft.

At the time she said she was still haunted by the memories of her peers refusing to believe she was a girl, questioning her sexual orientation and even groping her physically.

'I was always taller, my feet were always bigger and my voice was deeper,' said Griner, who is 6 feet 8 with a wingspan of 88 inches.

In an honest interview with the Los Angeles Times, the Phoenix Mercury powerhouse described one day in seventh grade when class had just let out and the hallway was flooded with students.

As Griner made her way through the crowd, a male student stopped her. 'You're a dude,' he said.

'I just stood there and took it. I was humiliated. The whole school was laughing at me,' Griner recalled.

'When I was younger, it really bothered 
me to the point where I was like "I don't even want to be alive; why am I
 getting treated like that?"' Griner said. 'But as I got older, I 
started caring less.'

She said she told her mother she liked girls after her first day of high school.

'I felt a release, I felt better,' Griner said. 'She was so cool about it. She was like "I kinda already know, and I love you."'

Her father, a former Marine, didn't take it so well and tension between the two saw Griner move out in her senior year.

Bullying: The Phoenix Mercury star was bullied at school, with some peers even calling her 'a dude'

Tall: 'I was always taller, my feet were always bigger and my voice was deeper,' said Griner, who is 6 feet 8 and has a wingspan of 88 inches

Despite her tumultuous home life, on 
court she shone, leading her team from Houston's Nimitz High to the 
Texas Division 5A girls' basketball state championship game and becoming
 America's most sought after recruit.

But she was still subject to nasty taunts from opposing sides, which left her regularly crying alone in her room after games, she said.

She went off to college at Baylor with a resolution to block out the negativity and not let bullying affect her. And by the end of sophomore year she succeeded.

But she said she chose to publicly come out last April, regardless of the fallout, to give young girls experiencing the same nightmare someone to look up to.

'I didn't have a real role model that I could look up to that was out openly,' she told The Times. 'I knew there were a lot of younger girls that needed someone.'

Though Griner said she never hid the 
fact that she was gay from friends and family, she found at Baylor there
 was 'an unwritten law' that players shouldn't discuss their sexual 
preferences.

Speaking to ESPN last May, she recalled: '... 
it was just kind of, like, one of those things, you know, just don't do 
it. They kind of tried to make it, like, 'Why put your business out on 
the street like that?'"

She explained that when Kim Mulkey recruited her, she was honest about who she was.

'I told Coach [Mulkey] when she was 
recruiting me. I was like, "I'm gay. I hope that's not a problem," and 
she told me that it wasn't,' Griner said. 'I mean, my teammates knew, 
obviously they all knew. Everybody knew about it.'

But when one of Griner's tweets to an
 ex-girlfriend was noticed by an staffer at Baylor, she was told to take
 the post down by 'someone in the office.'

'It was a recruiting thing,' Griner 
added. 'The coaches thought that if it seemed like they condoned it, 
people wouldn't let their kids come play for Baylor.'
