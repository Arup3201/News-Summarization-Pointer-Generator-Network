The Federal Government has successfully repealed the mining tax.

Finance Minister Mathias Cormann announced that the government earlier had signed a deal with the Palmer United Party on the repeal of the mining tax.

The bill was pushed through the Senate 36 votes to 33, with a series of amendments agreed to by PUP and Motoring Enthusiast Party Senator Ricky Muir  

Labor Senator Penny Wong labelled it 'another stealth attack' and went further calling it 'another dirty deal they (the Federal Government) have tried to ram through the chamber, as they break promise after promise after promise'.

'We support the amendments put forward by the government because we must remove the mining tax because this unfair tax must be removed as soon as possible,' said PUP Senate Leader Glenn Lazarus.

The school kids bonus, worth $410 for primary school children and double for those in high school, remains in place until the end of 2016.  

The Australian Motoring Enthusiast Party Senator Ricky Muir has supported the government's bill to repeal the mining tax

The mining tax which was introduced as a 30 per cent levy on 'super profits' back on 1 July, 2012 is dead after the government had it successfully repealed through the Upper House

The three key measures will cost the government up to $6.5 billion.

'This is a win for Australians,' Senator Lazarus said.

He said that his party would not have allowed the bill to pass without retention of the school kids bonus, low income super contribution and low income support bonus.

'It's let the big miners off the hook,' said Greens Senate leader Christine Milne.
