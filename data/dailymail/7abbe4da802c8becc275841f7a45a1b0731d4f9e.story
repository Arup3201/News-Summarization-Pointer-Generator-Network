He was that 12-year-old boy in that red jumper tugging his cheeks on the cover of Placebo's 1996 debut album.

Now David Fox, an unemployed chef from Scunthorpe, Lincolnshire, is set to sue the Britpop band for damages arguing that he never consented to the image being used.

The 28-year-old claims the album's success caused him to be bullied at school and ostracised from his peers. He took a year out of school, eventually dropping out of his GCSEs as a result.

Iconic: Wearing a baggy red jumper and pulling on his face, David Fox's pose became iconic but he claims it led to him being bullied at school and ostracised from his peers

In an interview with The Times, Mr Fox said: 'What had 
happened was my brother had just passed away, and my cousin came up from
London to see me.

'He was a professional photographer, 
and he took some photographs of my family for his personal use. He 
brought up all his equipment and got me to do a few poses outside.'

His cousin called Mr Fox a month later to say he was going to be on the cover of a rock album, remarking: 'Isn't that cool?'

Domino effect: Mr Fox, who says he did not give his consent to be splashed on the band's debut cover when he was 12, is now an unemployed chef

Instead it turned Mr Fox's life into a
nightmare. The album sold phenomenally well and reached number five in 
the charts. Mr Fox's face was everywhere.

'It was in Virgin, it was in 
HMV, it was in Tesco, it was all over the place,' he said. 'I was watching 
EastEnders with my mum and I saw one of the billboards by the Tube 
station and it had my face on there.'

Mr Fox, who had been popular at 
school, was teased by his classmates and slowly edged out. 'Nobody 
wanted me on their side or anything like 
that,' he said. 'Even the teachers used to pull me aside and ask me 
about this CD 
cover.'

In the end the bullying got so bad 
that Mr Fox's mother had to drive him home from school every day so he 
could avoid the pupils waiting for him at the gates.

Not our fault: Placebo's agents, Riverman Management said that Mr Fox's case should be directed against Virgin, the label that put the album out, rather than the band (pictured) themselves

He took a year out and then dropped out completely. Mr Fox then trained as a chef but was made redundant in the recession.

He claims the knock-on effect of the 
album cover disrupted his whole life and is now using his mother's 
savings and scraping together every spare bit of money he has to file a 
lawsuit against Placebo next month.

The band's agents, Riverman 
Management told The Times yesterday that Mr Fox's case should be 
directed against Virgin, the label that put the album out, rather than 
the band themselves. 

Placebo went on to release five studio albums and sell more than 10 million records worldwide.

Blink
182, Enema of the State

Janine Lindemulder had been a porn star when she starred on the cover of Blink 182's 1999 album. In 2002 she married Jesse James - who later married and cheated on Sandra Bullock - but was arrested for assaulting him after they split. Later she went to prison for four months for tax evasion and was reportedly in trouble last year for assaulting Jesse again.

Vampire Weekend, Contra

The preppy-looking girl on Vampire Weekend's 2010 album is former model Ann Kirsten Kennis in a Polaroid from 1983. The band loved the image but it came as a surprise to Kennis who only discovered her face was being used after her daughter bought the album home. The then 53-year-old who lives in Connecticut, sued photographer Tom Brody and the band for $2million. The band later settled out of court.

Led Zeppelin, Houses of the Holy

The six children on the iconic 1973 Zeppelin album shot on Giant's Causeway, Northern Ireland, are actually just a collage of two siblings Stefan and Samantha Gates who were five and seven at the time. Now Stefan is a cookery TV star, most notably for BBC2's Cooking In The Danger Zone. He has admitted to finding the album's artwork 'disturbing and haunting'.

The Smiths, Heaven Knows I'm Miserable NowA miserable looking Vivian Nicholson appeared on the cover of The Smith's 1984 single Heaven Knows I'm Miserable Now. Nicholson became famous when she received £152,319 (around £3million in today's money) on the football pools. She announced to the press that she would 'spend, spend, spend' and spend she did until she became bankrupt in the 1970s. This photograph of Nicholson is believed to have been taken before her big win. The Smith's ascertained that by 1984 she was definitely miserable now.
