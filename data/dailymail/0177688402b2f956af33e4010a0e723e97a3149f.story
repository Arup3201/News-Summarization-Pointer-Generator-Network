The former headmaster of the £24,000-a-year prep school attended by Boris Johnson has been arrested on suspicion of child sex offences.

Clive Williams led Ashdown House school in East Sussex, whose former pupils also include the Homeland actor Damian Lewis, the Queen's nephew Viscount Linley and former Tory chief whip Andrew Mitchell, for almost 30 years.

He is understood to be the 69-year-old man who Sussex Police say they arrested and interviewed on Wednesday over alleged sexual assaults and child neglect.

Mr Williams was released on bail while investigations continue and is not charged with any offence.

A force spokesman said: 'Officers 
investigating allegations of historical sexual abuse at a school in East
 Sussex have arrested a local man.

'The 69-year-old was arrested on 
Wednesday, July 9 on suspicion of sexual assaults and child neglect. A 
computer and documentation were seized for examination.

'After being interviewed the man was released on police bail on the same day until November 11 while inquiries continue.'

London
 mayor Boris Johnson was a boarder at the school - seen as a feeder for 
Eton College, which Mr Johnson also attended - with his siblings 
including his brother Jo and sister Rachel.

A spokesman for the family told The Times:
 'We are all sad to hear this news. We were all four happy at Ashdown 
and will always be especially grateful to Clive Williams for his 
fantastic teaching.'

There is no suggestion that the Johnsons, Mr Lewis, Mr Mitchell or Viscount Linley were among the alleged victims.

Mr Williams took the helm of the school near 
Tunbridge Wells, Kent, with his wife Rowena in 1975 and remained until 
2003, a time in which the school admitted girls for the first time.

Since he left, however, the 170-year-old school has become the centre of allegations of historic sexual abuse.

In
 December it emerged two former pupils were suing the school over abuse 
they claimed happened in the 1970s and involved 'more than one teacher'.

An
 email seen by the Daily Mail said: 'The effects of this abuse has 
damaged a number of pupils long into adulthood and it is felt among us 
that, as part of the healing process, it is important for us to take our
 power back and take action against such damaging and horrendous 
actions.'

Multiple 
complaints have been forwarded to officers from Sussex Police's 
Operation Mitre who have been in touch with more than 20 alleged 
victims, including some who live abroad.

'We have since been in contact with 20 people reporting offences against them. Most
 have already been interviewed by officers from our specialist Child 
Protection Team'

The Sussex Police spokesman added: 'During January this year we were contacted by a firm of Solicitors representing a number of clients who have reported to them that they were sexually and physically assaulted by staff whilst they were pupils at Ashdown House School near Forest Row in the 1970's.

'We have since been in contact with 20 people reporting offences against them, including those clients.

'Most have already been interviewed by officers from our specialist Child Protection Team in East Sussex. Arrangements are in hand to interview the others, some of whom live abroad.

'The investigation continues and now spans a period from the late 1960s to the early 1980s.

'We wish to emphasise that there are no current safeguarding issues at the school in relation to this.'

The school has said it will co-operate fully with police.

The police spokesman added: 'Reports of this kind are always taken seriously, however long ago the offending is said to have occurred. We encourage anybody who has information relevant to this enquiry, including any former pupils who may have been abused at the school during that period and have yet to come forward, to make contact with us.

'At this stage we are not disclosing the number of people against whom allegations have been made, while the enquiry continues.'
