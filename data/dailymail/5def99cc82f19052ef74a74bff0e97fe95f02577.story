Arsenal made it two wins from two in the UEFA Youth League as they produced a five-goal blitz to crush Galatasaray on Wednesday afternoon.

After an even first half, Gedion Zelalem’s strike just before half-time triggered an avalanche of goals, with Kaylen Hinds, Chris Willock, Alex Iwobi and Daniel Crowley all getting on the scoresheet.

The comprehensive win at Meadow Park in Boreham Wood followed up the Young Gunners’ 2-0 success at Borussia Dortmund on matchday one and put them in firm control of their group.

Arsenal started the match on the front foot with early opportunities for Hinds and Crowley though both were a little too high with their efforts.

It was one-way traffic for much of the half as Arsenal penned their Turkish visitors in and Crowley came within inches when he ran on to Iwobi’s pass and rattled the crossbar from 20 yards.

But just as it looked as though the sides would return to the dressing rooms scoreless, Zelalem set off on a run from just inside the Galatasaray half and darted into the open space in front of him. The German youth international then cut inside a defender and fired past Ali Buyuk in goal.

The goal seemed to break Galatasaray’s spirit and it took just 12 minutes of the second half for Arsenal to gain their second. Tafari Moore made progress down the left-hand side and squared for Hinds to tap-in.

A minute later and the contest was definitely settled when Willock fired home from 10 yards out and a fourth came shortly afterwards as Iwobi found the net from the edge of the box following Crowley’s assist.

The highly-rated Crowley deserved a goal and he got one from the penalty spot after being challenged illegally in the box.

Furkan Kopuz did gain a late consolation for the visitors but it took none of the gloss off a fine Arsenal display.

The Gunners will seal their passage to the knockout round if they get the better of Anderlecht in their next two matches.
