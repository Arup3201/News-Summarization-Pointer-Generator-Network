An Italian woman is suing the studio behind children's cartoon Peppa Pig as she claims a character that shares her name has left her 'damaged'.

Gabriella Capra, 40, from Perugia, says she is being ridiculed by friends and colleagues over character Gabriella Goat – Capra being the Italian word for goat.

Ms Capra has now taken the British company behind Peppa Pig to court, demanding 100,000 euros (£79,850).

Peppa Pig is made by Astley Baker Davies animation studios in London, but the children's show about Peppa and her animal friends has become a firm favourite around the globe, including in Italy.

A recent episode sees the Pig family visit Italy on holiday, where they encounter the Goat family and Peppa befriends Gabriella Goat, which in the Italian version is Gabriella Capra.

Since it aired in Italy, the real-life Gabriella Capra, a businesswoman, has become the butt of every joke among her peers, and has turned to a consumer's advocacy group in Milan which has filed a civil suit against Astley Baker Davies.

'Since this episode came out on the small screen she has been the frequent object of derisive jokes by friends and colleagues,' the National Foundation of Consumers told The Telegraph.

The organisation claims the London studios should be held responsible for failing to protect Ms Capra 'who holds a serious job with many responsibilities and who finds herself innocently exposed to public hilarity.'

The National Foundation of Consumers claims Ms Capra has a case as Peppa Pig does not include a disclaimer in the show noting that any similarities with real life people is coincidental, a representative told the Telegraph. 

Peppa Pig, an animated series about a four-year-old piglet and her family, originally aired in Britain in 2004, and has since grown to beocme a global phenomenon.

So far, four seasons have been aired, and the show is currently broadcast in 180 territories.
