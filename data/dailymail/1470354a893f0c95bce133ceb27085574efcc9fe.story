A 43-year-old grandmother has defended her raunchy choice of wedding music after being ridiculed on YouTube and labelled a redneck.

Theresa and Christopher Semonski got married on 28 July and the blushing bride choose to gyrate provocatively rather than walk her way down the aisle to the x-rated Buckcherry song ‘Crazy B***h’.

‘My mom dancing down the isle (sic) doin what she wants having fun and being her,’ commented daughter Kendra Garber of Pekin, Illinois, on a video of the routine that she posted on YouTube last week for posterity.

The clip has touched a nerve with YouTubers and has been viewed more than 650,000 times, generating over 1,500 comments almost overwhelming negative and often cruel remarks such as ‘Is this the previews from My Big Fat Whitetrash Wedding?’

As well as the bride's rather crude moves, the video is full of other hilarious moments such as near the start when a concerned father quickly tries to cover his young son's ears after realizing that the lyrical content of the song is quite racy.

Once the bride has made it down the aisle there is also the ridiculous sight of Chrisopher Semonski and his groomsmen all wearing matching bandanas.

As the choice of music might suggest, Theresa Semonski is not a woman to be trifled with and after reading one too many comments about her big day being called a ‘classless piece of white trash’ and ‘EVERYTHING that is wrong with America,’ the newlywed decided to put the record straight.

Here is a sanitized version of the opening lyrics from 'Crazy B***h'...

Break me down, you got a lovely faceWe're going to your place, and now you got to freak me outScream so loud, getting f***in' laidYou want me to stay but I got to make my wayHey! You're a crazy b***hBut you f**k so good I'm on top of itWhen I dream I'm doing you all nightScratches all down my back to keep me right onHey! You're a crazy b***hBut you f**k so good I'm on top of itWhen I dream I'm doing you all nightScratches all down my back to keep me right on

‘Who made the rule on how my wedding should be and just so you know it was my wedding at my house and they were my guests if and when you ever find anyone to marry your narrow minded self you can have your wedding at your location with your guests in your way and guess what I will respect your choice because I live in the USA and that is what we do here,' she wrote.

'Thank you to all my friends and family (including my son) who fight or have fought for my freedom to do this,' she continued.

‘Wow I can promise I am not pregnant and I will bet my IQ is higher then yours and guess what I am employed with a great job and in my job I care for all different people with no judgment.

'WE had a wedding for us the craziness that is in our heads and all our friends and family get it.

'Have been told it was greatest wedding people have been too.

'You all just upset that you don’t have creativity or the balls to live your life freely like we do. Thank GOD I live in the USA.

‘See everyone loved it I have total self respect and proud of everything I do with no regrets and thank GOD I can defend this. All those people are my family they grew up with me and raised me.

'I stand by this and so does my 
husband friends and family. All I wish is that I can find a wider shot 
so you all can see all the guests dancing and rocking out like we always
do.

'I am a 43 year old grandma who rocks out and enjoys life. Proud of me and my family so all that are out there ROCK ON.'

After the ceremony, the newly weds, 
who met in May 2011, rode off to the reception flanked by 'a parade of 
Harleys...and black sunglasses.'

The song that accompanied the Semonski's nuptials was inspired by Paris Hilton's infamous sex tape. It was peaked at #59 on the Billboard Hot 100 in May 2006 for Los Angeles hard rockers Buckcherry.
