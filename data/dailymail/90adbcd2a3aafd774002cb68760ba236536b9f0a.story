The computer searches of a 12-year-old girl who killed herself after being cyberbullied for two years has revealed that she was looking for ways to commit suicide.

After Rebecca Sedwick's suicide, police looked at her computer and found search queries such as 'What is overweight for a 13-year-old girl' and various ways to kill herself.

One of the Florida girl's screensavers also showed Rebecca with her head resting on a railroad track.

Missed: Rebecca Sedwick died earlier this week after years of online bullying

She changed one of her online screen names to 'That Dead Girl.' She messaged a boy: 'I'm jumping.' And then, on Monday, she went to an abandoned concrete plant in Lakeland where she liked to hang out, climbed a tower and hurled herself to her death.

Her body was found on Tuesday and now police are investigating as many as 15 girls to see who contributed to driving Rebecca to suicide.

Polk County Sheriff Grady Judd said Rebecca had been 'absolutely terrorized' by the other girls.

'We can see from what we've been investigating so far that Rebecca wasn't attacking back,' Judd said.

'She appeared to be beat down. She appeared to have a defeatist attitude. And quite frankly, the entire investigating is exceptionally disturbing.'

The bullying started over a boy last year at Crystal Lake Middle School and at one point she was suspended for fighting with a girl who was previously considered her friend.

Last December, Rebecca was hospitalized for three days after cutting her wrists because of what she said was bullying, according to the sheriff.

'When she was being bullied at Crystal Lake Middle, she used to come home every day and tell me how she wasn’t worth anything, that she was ugly, how she was stupid,' Tricia Norman said.

'And I said, ''Baby what on earth would make you think that? You’re the most beautiful person I know and the smartest person I know.'''

Later, after Rebecca complained that she had been pushed in the hallway and that another girl wanted to fight her, Rebecca's mother began home-schooling her, Judd said.

This fall, Rebecca started at a new school, Lawton Chiles Middle Academy, and loved it, Judd said. But the bullying continued online.

'She put on a perfect, happy face. She never told me,' Rebecca's mother, Tricia Norman, told the Lakeland Ledger.

'I never had a clue. I mean, she told me last year when she was being bullied, but not this year, and I have no idea why.'

Once police checked her cell phone they discovered that the bullying had not stopped, especially on Kik Messenger, Instagram and Ask.fm.

'They would tell her she's ugly, stupid, nobody liked her go kill herself," Ms Norman said.

She has started a Facebook page to try to fight back against online bullies, called Rebecca Sedwick Against Bullying.

Ms Norman told 10 News she was inspired to start it after reading her daughter's journal.

In it, Rebecca had written: 'Every day more and more kids kill themselves because of bullying. How many lives have to be lost until people realize words do matter?'

Ms Norman wants online bullies to face harsher consequences, and begged other young victims to stay strong and seek help, adding: 'Don't ever give up, like Becca did.'
