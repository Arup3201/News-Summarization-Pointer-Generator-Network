Ministers have failed to devise a 
‘credible’ growth strategy and must put the country on an economic ‘war 
footing’, according to Tory grandee Lord Heseltine.

The Tory grandee, who raised eyebrows in Whitehall by commissioning a cartoon for the cover of his report, calls on the Prime Minister to establish a National Growth 
Council to rival the National Security Council and to appoint a  
Minister for Growth.

He adds that David Cameron and George 
Osborne must act now on immigration, airports and energy policy if they 
want to boost growth, but his comments were seized on by Labour as proof the government's strategy is not working.

Lord Heseltine – who helped to 
revitalise Liverpool and London Docklands when he was Margaret 
Thatcher’s Environment Secretary in the 1980s – also calls on the 
Government to take a much more hands-on approach to  funnelling cash to 
the regions.

In his report published today - No Stone Unturned In Pursuit of Growth - he urges the Coalition to ‘clarify 
urgently’ where it wants to build a new hub airport before the next 
election and seek approval from voters in 2015, rather than delay any 
decision until after the election.

The Government should also ‘accelerate
the pace at which it is tackling illegal immigration, overstayers and 
the backlog of residency applications’ with an immediate injection of 
resources and staff, he adds.

Only when illegal residents are 
removed, he says, will the Government be able to persuade more skilled 
workers to come to the UK.

Today Mr Osborne said: 'I wanted Lord Heseltine to do what he does best: challenge received wisdom and give us ideas on how to bring Government and industry together. 

'He has done exactly that. This is a report bursting with ideas and we will study it very carefully.'

Lord Heseltine's wide-ranging report demands George Osborne do more to intervene to stimulate growth. The
Chancellor was out jogging in Westminster yesterday before Cabinet met in 
Downing Street

Some in Whitehall think the report will be quietly shelved.

Lord Heseltine takes aim 
at ministers squabbling over nuclear power and renewable energy, saying 
they must ‘set out a definitive and unambiguous energy policy’ so 
businesses have the certainty they need to invest.

The report, entitled No Stone 
Unturned: In Pursuit of Growth, says the Growth Council should send 
money to Local Development Partnerships in struggling areas and work 
with a series of Industry Councils in key sectors of the economy.

He 
adds: ‘A National Growth Strategy must be created in consultation with 
the business community, setting out a progressive vision for wealth 
creation over the long term.’

Lord Heseltine also demands that everyone works harder to promote growth.

He said: ‘Too often we think of he 
country’s economic problems as something beyond us as individuals ... We
all need to raise our game, and keep raising it.’

Asked if Mr Cameron needs to put the country on an economic war footing, Lord Heseltine said: ‘We have a national crisis.

‘We need to engage the war psychology,
that we’re all in this together. And this can only happen with 
concerted national leadership.

Labour leader Ed Miliband said Lord Heseltine's report proved the government's economic strategy is 'not the answer'

‘It’s a war against complacency and 
indifference, and on all those who feel they don’t have a role to play, 
when they do.’

At Prime Minister's Questions today Labour leader Ed Miliband said Lord Heseltine's criticism was proof the government's economic strategy is not working.

Mr Miliband told Mr Cameron: 'You say Lord 
Heseltine's report says you're on the right track; goodness knows what 
his report would have said if he had said you're on the wrong track.

'He said there was no strategy for jobs and growth, business had no 
confidence (and) deregulation - your chosen approach - is not the 
answer.'

Lord Heseltine said in his report there were people who were 'resistant' to his recommendations.

Mr Miliband added: 'We know who they are; the Chancellor and the Prime Minister.

'The evidence of the last two years is that deregulation, sink or swim, their answer is not the answer. Lord Heseltine is right and they're wrong."

But Mr Cameron today hailed the 'excellent report' and repeatedly denied it criticised current Government policies.

'What he is saying is that over decades in our economy, it became too centralised, regions and nations of our countries fell behind, manufacturing halved as a share of national income during the last government, and, for instance, during the boom years in the West Midlands there were no net private sector jobs.'

The report was commissioned by Mr Cameron’s former policy
guru Steve Hilton, who left to work in the US earlier this year.

Mr Osborne is expected to adopt some of his proposals in the autumn economic statement to Parliament next month.

Despite his criticisms on growth, Lord
Heseltine, 79, does explicitly back the Government’s economic strategy,
saying it has  ‘rightly focused on getting debt under control’, which 
has ‘cut the deficit by 25 per cent and reduced the cost of borrowing’.

Shadow Treasury Minister Rachel Reeves
said: ‘It’s a  damning indictment of this government that, halfway 
through this parliament, a former Conservative cabinet minister is still
calling for a plan for growth.’
