Shocking video has emerged of a mother holding her terrified daughter in a headlock while the little girl was having her ears pierced.

The footage, taken in Chicago, Illinois, shows the young child crying out in fear as a man approaches with a  piercing instrument.

At one point, the girl can be heard screaming 'please don't, please don't' as she cowers in a chair while a man off camera accuses the frightened youngster of 'acting like a little baby'.

Eventually, a woman believed to be her mother puts the tearful girl in a hold while the procedure is carried out.

The film, taken on a mobile phone, has sparked outrage on social media websites with some accusing the mother of going too far.

One YouTube user, Valerie Jones wrote: 'This is horrible - how could anyone hear a child's plea and ignore it?' 

Another, Shelley Carefoot, said: 'See that poor child begging that man with her eyes. What a disgrace.' 

And aftern viewing the video, Adrien Dwight wrote: 'I cannot believe what I just saw.'

The girl can be heard screaming 'please don't, please don't' as she cowers in a chair and tries to put her hands up to stop the piercing from happening

The video starts with the girl sitting in a chair with a man preparing to pierce her ear.

But she repeatedly holds her hands up and begs the adults standing around her not to let it happen crying: 'But it's going to hurt'.

At one point, the mother says she is going to count to five ordering the youngster to 'calm down', to 'hold on tight' and ordering the girl to stop resisting.

But the hysterical child repeatedly cries out 'Please don't, please don't.' and sobs uncontrollably as her mother pins her down.

Moments later, the youngster sits quietly as the man pierces her second ear. 

According to Fox2now, piercer Pretty Ricky, posted the video online along with the words: 'This lil girl nearly lost her dammm mind when I was trying to Pierce her ears yall gotta watch this till the end.'
