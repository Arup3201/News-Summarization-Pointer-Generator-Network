A shocking video claims to show the cruel method used to catch tuna that unnecessarily kills hundreds and thousands of sharks, dolphins, turtles and other species every year.

Australian consumers of tinned and fresh tuna have no way of knowing whether or not the tuna they eat is caught using this method, unless the tuna brand elects to state it on their label.

And Greenpeace has warned that the popular 'dolphin friendly' tag used by many tuna brands is 'meaningless' because it is not regulated.

A Greenpeace video claims to show the harmful 'FAD method' of fishing tuna and its effect on other species

Hundreds and thousands of sharks, dolphins, turtles and other species are killed every year when they are unintentionally caught in nets after being attracted by fish aggregating devices (FADs)

In the video released by Greenpeace, fisheries from France, the UK and Italy are shown using fish aggregating devices (FADs) and  nets to catch tuna in the Indian Ocean.  

Marine animals including whale sharks, silky sharks, marlins, rays, oceanic whitetip sharks, olive ridley sea turtles, mako sharks and other mixed species of fish - some of which are threatened species - are seen caught up in the nets and cast aside by fisherman.

At the end of the video the dead marine animals are dumped back into the ocean.

Greenpeace oceans campaigner Nathaniel Pelle said the purse seine nets pictured in the video – which are nets that circle around schools of fish before being drawn up like a purse – were not necessarily harmful when used on their own but were problematic when used with FADs.

'The fish aggregating devices are designed to attract tuna but they also attract all sorts of other marine life,' Mr Pelle told Daily Mail Australia.

'When you use those two methods in combination you end up catching large amounts of incidental species you don't mean to catch.'

Australian fishing companies have not been linked to the video but Australian consumers may eat fish caught using this method without knowing because it does not need to be stated on the label of tuna cans

Australian consumers have no way of knowing where their canned tuna comes from because food labelling laws in Australia only require that canned tuna companies state where the fish is packed (usually Thailand) and not where it is caught.

Greenpeace says 90 percent of tuna caught in the Indian Ocean is caught using FADs.

Most tuna caught in the western Pacific Ocean is caught using the less harmful 'pole and line' method or using purse seine nets without FADs.

Around 800,000 tonnes of tuna are caught in the Indian Ocean, where the video was taken, each year. Around 2.6 million tonnes are caught in the western Pacific Ocean.

'Most tuna in the Pacific is caught using purse seine nets, which is  a fairly clean way of fishing because giant schools of tuna tend to swim on their own,' Mr Pelle said.

'They don't tend to catch as many sharks, turtles or other species as you would using this device.'

Mr Pelle said every major Australian canned tuna brand has committed to removing fish aggregation devices from their supply chains by the end of next year, but the organisation is still calling for clearer labelling laws.

'We've been asking for all seafood in Australia to be labelled where it's caught, not where it's put in a tin,' Mr Pelle said.

'So Australian consumers can make an informed choice about whether they want to buy tuna that results in killing hundreds of thousands of sharks, dolphins, whales and turtles.'

Mr Pelle added that 'dolphin friendly' labels on tuna cans were 'relatively meaningless'.

'It's not regulated; some people put their own dolphin friendly label on their tins without any official body giving them that logo,' he said.

'And just because it's so-called dolphin friendly it doesn't mean it's not killing sharks or other species as well.'

A spokeswoman for Food Standards Australia New Zealand said dolphin-free labelling isn't covered by the Food Standards Code, but consumer law comes into play regarding misleading or deceptive claims.

Mr Pelle said there were also issues for conscious consumers when they eat fresh tuna from supermarkets or restaurants.

'In supermarkets customers need to be told where it was imported from, but it could be caught anywhere in the world and brought to Indonesia or Thailand to be packed,' he said.

'In a restaurant they don't have to tell you anything whatsoever, you could be looking at your sashimi or red tuna steak with no way of knowing where it's come from.'

Matthew Evans, host of new documentary series What's The Catch which starts screening this Thursday on SBS, said consumers should look for the label 'pole and line caught'.

'As a consumer in this country foreign labelling laws make it virtually impossible for you know what you're eating,' Mr Evans told Daily Mail Australia.

'If I'm looking for tinned tuna I'd be looking for pole and line caught, because even if you don't know where it's come from you know how it's caught.'

Mr Evans added that tuna fisheries in Australia were well managed.

Brian Jeffriess, CEO of the Australian Southern Bluefin Tuna Industry Association, said Australian tuna fishers only supply fresh tuna, and have not produced tuna for use in cans since the 1990s.

Mr Jeffriess said 96 percent of tuna in Australia was caught by the 'ranching' method, in which tuna is caught live using purse seine nets and towed to farms to grow larger for six months.

He said the other 4 percent was caught using the 'pole and line' method, which sees fish caught using lines with about 1200 baited hooks attached.

Mr Jeffriess added that Australian tuna fishers do not use FADs and the practice is banned in local waters.

'We don't need to use FADs, we catch a high quality premium tuna which swims in schools naturally in clean areas,' he told Daily Mail Australia.

'We use planes to see the movement of fish and we use bait to attract it.'

Mr Jeffriess said it was easy for tuna brands to say they were dolphin friendly because dolphins did not tend to swim near most species of tuna.

'The schools they catch in the western Pacific and Indian Ocean don't move with dolphins,' he said.

'In the eastern Pacific dolphins move with yellow fin tuna.

'They actually have methods of lowering the side of the purse seine nets and it's possible with divers to move the dolphins out but it takes time.'

Greenpeace said the nets were not necessarily harmful  but were problematic when used with FADs
