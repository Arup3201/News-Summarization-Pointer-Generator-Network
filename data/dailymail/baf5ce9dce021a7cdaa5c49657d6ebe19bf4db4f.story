For model Penny Lancaster keeping her looks in check is an essential part of her job.

And while she may have arrived in her forties, Rod Stewart's wife has no intentions of getting any extra help to maintain her youthful glow.

Speaking on Lorraine this morning, Penny admitted that living in California and seeing so many women 
with plastic surgery puts her off having any unnatural procedures 
herself.

Natural beauty: Penny Lancaster admitted on Lorraine that seeing so many women who have had plastic surgery in LA really puts her off

She explained: 'When I question myself sometimes as I'm getting
older and I'm thinking, "Umm".

'And then I come to LA and I remind 
myself of the reasons why I don't want to go down that alley.'

Discussing her own beauty secrets, the one-time face of Ultimo 
revealed: 'Obviously we all know that looking after ourselves is a good 
idea.

'Exercising, eating well, but mostly for me - with the travelling 
that I do - it's keeping hydrated.

Aging gracefully: The model turned photographer says her key to beauty is keeping her skin well hydrated and it has obviously worked judging by photographs of her in 2000 (L) and today (R)

'That's keeping your face moisturised 
and drinking plenty of fluids including water and vegetable juices.'

Asked
what she thinks defines natural beauty, Penny said: 'I'd have to say 
it's not how beautiful you look, but it's about that natural beautiful 
person that's from within.

So it's about that radiant smile and the 
sparkle in the eye.'

Speaking from Los 
Angeles, the model and photographer added 'I believe the most beautiful 
person I know is my mum.

'Naturally she's a beautiful woman with or 
without makeup. Particularly when she's spent two hours mucking out the 
horses in the wind and the rain, she still looks lovely.

Judge: Penny, who became a model after entering a modelling competition herself, will be judging Lorraine Naked 2

'It's that rosy 
glow and she's always happy.'

The 41-year-old today launched Lorraine Naked 2 – the nationwide search to find the prettiest, natural-looking beauty under and over the age of 40 who will get to model a beauty television campaign.

Penny, who became a model after entering a modelling competition herself, will be judging Lorraine Naked 2 alongside top celebrity photographer Nicky Johnston who has photographed the likes of Nicole Sherzinger and David Beckham, as well as presenter Lorraine Kelly, and Red magazine’s beauty editor at large Rosie Green.

Speaking about Lorraine Naked 2, Penny said: 'It's fantastic, I'm very glad to be one of the judges, and what an amazing opportunity for any woman out there.

'And that means anyone - any shape or size - it's about embracing your natural beauty.'
