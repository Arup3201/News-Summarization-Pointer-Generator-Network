Tottenham have told Napoli they will have to pay £20million if they want midfielder Sandro.

The 25-year-old Brazilian made just 25 appearances for Spurs in an injury hit campaign last season but he has attracted interest from Rafa Benitez's side.

The former Chelsea and Liverpool boss sees Sandro as the perfect midfield addition to help Napoli build on their third place finish in Serie A last season.

Wanted: But Sandro's price tag of £20million could price Napoli out of any deal

While new Spurs coach Mauricio Pochettino is not keen on letting the Brazilian leave, the club would listen to bids starting at the £20million mark.

Napoli president Aurelio De Laurentiis seems unlikely to offer that kind of money though which could see Sandro extend his four-year stay at White Hart Lane.

He has two years left on a five-year deal with Spurs.
