Astonishing photos showing British soldiers performing 'It Ain't Half Hot Mum'-style concert parties at a Prisoner of War camp have emerged after nearly 70 years.

The images depict the incredibly elaborate theatre productions the men of Stalag 383 put on to keep up the morale of the 4,000 prisoners during World War Two.

The sets, costumes, performances and concert programmes were of almost professional standards, with a great deal of time, effort and skill clearly going into creating them.

The theatrical and musical concerts 
were held in a barn-like building the men called the 'Ofladium Theatre',
as the camp had once been an Oflag - a camp for officers.

Many
tons of earth were transported and stamped down methodically to form a 
sloping floor in the hall to give the audience an unobstructed view.

The
photos show servicemen wearing women's clothing, playing female roles 
in classics like HMS Pinafore, The Gondoliers and Dick Whittington.

They
also highlight a sizeable orchestra playing saxophones, trumpets, tubas
and guitars, tackling numbers like Beethoven's Eroica and music by 
Mendelssohn that had been banned by the Nazis.

The pictures made up a scrapbook 
dedicated to the 'Ofladium National Theatre Company' and was compiled by
John Roberts, a leading light of the movement.

He
sent the book home to his parents in January 1945. It recently turned 
up on sale at a market stall in south west England and was bought by the
current owner.

He is now selling the book at auction in Ludlow, Shropshire, with a pre-sale estimate of Â£500.

Stalag
383 was located outside Nuremberg and held 4,000 NCOs and Warrant 
Officers who persuaded their German guards to help them with their 
theatrical hobbies.

As well 
as theatrical shows, the company also had a dance band led by PoW Denis 
Whiteley and a 'National Orchestra' that was conducted by David Laird.

Richard
Westwood-Brookes, of Mullock's auction house, said: 'The whole book 
provides an almost surreal impression of PoW life in the camp.

'Each
production is featured with a remarkably - almost professionally - 
produced programme, with a typed cast list, and stage photographs.

'Looking at the photographs, one might think it was the West End rather than a PoW camp.

'While
other Allied PoWs were digging tunnels and doing anything to escape, it
seems the inmates at Stalag 383 were having a jolly good time of it.

'And
because there were no women in the camp, the many female roles taken in
the productions had to be fulfilled by the PoWs themselves, and judging
from the many photos, they managed to carry them off with aplomb.

'The
history of the camp bears out the lifestyle they enjoyed. It was almost
exclusively given over to NCOs, and as anyone in the forces knows, a 
band of NCOs will always get the best for themselves.

'In
the case of 383, it appears the Germans had despaired of the various 
antics of NCOs at other camps in getting out of work duties, so they 
were almost exclusively sent to 383 and given the "fur lined" treatment.

'Instead of being held in draconian conditions, the inmates enjoyed small dormitory huts housing 14 or fewer.

'They enjoyed sports like cricket, which bemused the Germans, walking and the theatre, which was particularly popular.

'One
inmate wrote home that he was "14 pounds heavier than when he joined 
up" and many of the German guards helped out their British counterparts,
and gave them information on the progress of the war.

'Events
like World War II carry with them many different stories. The accepted 
version of PoW life has been borne out in Hollywood blockbusters like 
"The Great Escape" and films like "The Wooden Horse".

'Certainly
for the men at these camps life was unbelievably tough, but clearly 
from the scrapbook of 383, this was not the story for everyone banged up
by the Germans.'

The sale is on August 21.
