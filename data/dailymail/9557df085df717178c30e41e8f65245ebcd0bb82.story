Darcy Smith, 41, is accused of having sex with the boy - a former student - when he was just 14 years old and living at their home in Washington state 

An award-winning elementary school teacher in Washington state is facing child rape charges following allegations that she sexually abused a former student.

Darcy Smith, 41, is accused of having sex with  the boy when he was just 14 years old and living with her, her husband and her children at their home in Renton.

The alleged victim, who is now 19 years old, first reported the allegations to the King County Sheriff’s Office last May.

Smith has been on administrative leave since August, when her employer, the Highline School District, was informed of the boy’s claims.

He told detectives that he and Smith started having sex when he was in the 8th grade and the relationship continued until he moved out of her home at 18.

The boy had moved in with Smith and her family when he was 12 years old and a pupil in her 6th grade class, reports Seattle PI.

After breaking his collarbone, Smith had taken him to the hospital and soon after that he started living at her house which was closer to the doctors than his own home.

The unusual arrangement had the blessing of the boy’s mother who didn’t speak English and though Smith would be a good influence on her son whose brother was in a gang.

According to the boy, he and Smith first had sex when he turned 14 and continued to have relations until he moved out four years later.

The boy told detective that Smith first showered him with gifts and affection before agreeing to care for him full time, according to charging papers.

But the victim said things would change in the evenings when the kids and Smith's husband went to bed, and she drank wine.

According to the documents, the victim said Smith made him promise not to tell anyone or 'she would go to jail and be in big trouble if he told.' 

Smith, who  received a regional Teacher of the Year award in 2012 for her employer, has been charged with three counts of third degree child rape.

She has worked for the district since 2001, most recently at McMicken Heights Elementary School.

The assaults are alleged to have begun in September 2008; charging papers suggest Smith was still sexually involved with the boy when she was named teacher of the year for the region in 2012.

Highline Public Schools spokeswoman Catherine Carbone Rogers said parents of children taught by Smith were notified of the investigation earlier this week.

Smith hasn’t been jailed and is scheduled to be arraigned next week.
