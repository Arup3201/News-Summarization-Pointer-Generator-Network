Jose Mourinho has claimed only one team tried to win at the Stadium of Light, but was full of praise for both sets of players.

Chelsea and Sunderland played out a goalless draw in the north east of England. The Premier League leaders were below par performance but the Portuguese manager claimed their lack of goals were due to opposition tactics rather than a failing on his part.

Speaking to Sky Sports, Mourinho said: 'I think clearly only one team wanted to win. The other team wanted to stop us to win but they did well.

'They defended a lot and they defended well. It is not a crime, it is a strategy and they did well in their approach. 

'My players tried everything. We got a little bit tired but I have nothing negative to say about my people. I think Sunderland defended very, very well.

'We didn't change our football, we tried always to play. We tried fresh people to give us a bit more in attack but the game was always difficult for us.'

Lee Cattermole was impressive in his role restricting the attacking space for Chelsea's midfielders 

The most controversial point in the match came from a moment apparent clumsiness rather than brilliance as Diego Costa's flailing arm caught Wes Brown in the face. 

The Brazilian-born forward had already been lucky to escape punishment after he kicked out at John O'Shea, but Mourinho had no complaints with referee Kevin Friend's performance.

He said: ‘I didn't see (the Diego Costa elbow incident) but the referee was close and he made in my opinion a very good performance. I thought everything was under control. 

'I didn’t see. Maybe if I see on television I have a better opinion.’
