A friend of notorious gangster Curtis Warren has reportedly claimed MI5 spies have planted secret microphones in his house and have trained birds to tap on his windows in an attempt to frighten him.

Businessman Philip Kerr is seeking to win a High Court injunction against the intelligence agents, who he says have targeted him because he refused to co-operate with the security service.

The 53-year-old says he has been subjected to a 'campaign of harassment' over the past 11 years, claiming agents have filled his houses in Wirral, Merseyside, and Thailand with hidden cameras and microphones.

Claims: Philip Kerr, a friend of notorious gangster Curtis Warren (pictured) has reportedly claimed MI5 spies  planted secret microphones in his house and trained birds to tap on his windows in an attempt to frighten him

He also claims rooks were trained to fly into his window. 

According to the Mirror he also says in legal papers that spies have interfered with his phone, TV and radio, and is prepared to pay £500,000 to fund his legal battle.

'My case simply is that I am being unlawfully harassed by the security services and I wish this harassment to stop,' he told the newspaper.

Headquarters: Mr Kerr says MI5, which has his headquarters in Millbank, London, (pictured) bugged his homes in Wirral, Merseyside and Thailand

Mr Kerr says he was approached by MI5 in 2003 when officers were investigating drugs baron Warren, who made more than £200million through his criminal empire and is the only drug trafficker to make it onto the Sunday Times Rich List.

However, he refused to provide any information on Warren and other criminals, including Colin 'Smigger' Smith, Britain's so-called Cocaine King, who was shot dead in Liverpool in 2007.

According to Mr Kerr, this prompted MI5 to start tracking him.

Support: Mr Kerr has been given advice by former MI5 intelligence officer and whistleblower Annie Machon (pictured)

His legal papers were lodged at the High Court last month, and he has hired lawyer and protection from harassment specialist Tim Lawson-Cruttenden, as well as seeking advice from ex-MI5 intelligence officer and whistleblower Annie Machon.  

'Annie confirmed to me that the things I am being subjected to are exactly the kinds of things MI5 do to get into your head. It is psychological warfare,' he said. 

Kerr’s barrister Anthony Barraclough, said: 'A lot of it is hard to believe but when you sit down with Phil, it is incredible to hear what he has to say. This has taken his life away and had a major effect on his health.'

Warren, 50, is due to be released from Belmarsh Prison in 2015 after he was jailed for 13 years in 2009 over a £1million cannabis smuggling plot in Jersey.

He was previously jailed in 1997 in the Netherlands when Dutch police seized a haul of drugs and banknotes worth £125m. However, he claims to have little cash left after his bank account was frozen in 2011. 

His sentence was extended in 1999 after he killed a fellow prisoner in a fight and was convicted of manslaughter.

Five weeks after being released he was arrested by Jersey police and accused of being the ringleader of a six-man gang who were trying to import 180kg of cannabis into the island from the Netherlands via a boat from France.

MI5 said it would neither confirm nor deny the allegations in the High Court Claim.
