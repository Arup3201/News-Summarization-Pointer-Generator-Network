Jose Mourinho launched another attack on referees on Thursday night after Chelsea were beaten 5-3 at White Hart Lane.

The Chelsea manager, who claimed Anthony Taylor should be ‘ashamed’ after failing to awarded a penalty in the 1-1 draw at Southampton, told Phil Dowd he was ‘too slow’.

Chelsea’s poor Christmas run means they are now level on points with defending champions Manchester City after they beat Sunderland 3-2.

Chelsea manager Jose Mourinho was furious after Eden Hazard was denied a second-half penalty

Immediately after Hazard collided with Federico Fazio in the second-half Mourinho launched into a tirade

This incredible defeat is only the second time in Mourinho’s history as top class manager that one of his teams has conceded five times in a game.

Mourinho’s side took the lead at Tottenham through Diego Costa and the Chelsea chief claims his side should have been given a penalty when Jan Vertonghen appeared to handle.

He said: ‘I can go in another direction and say what we all know, which is, with the result 1-0, one clear action could make it 2-0. 

Mourinho launched into a tirade at fourth official Andre Marriner after the incident involving Chelsea's Hazard

Chelsea boss Jose Mourinho directed a furious tirade towards fourth official Andre Marriner in the second-half

‘Normally, at 2-0, the result would be completely different and the history of the game would be different.

‘You are talking about handball. Why do you want me to speak? You all know.

‘I don't think we need clarification when there are no doubts. When you have doubts, when the situation is not clear, I think the discussion comes good. 

This is the moment that angered Mourinho, when Hazard tumbled under the challenge of Federico Fazio

Hazard fell into the penalty area after the collision but it was unclear where contact had taken place

‘Everyone can have a different opinion. The same way against Southampton there was no discussion, today there was no discussion too.

‘We are speaking about two matches, six points, we had one out of six when two crucial decisions would give us six points.

‘What matters are the points. The decisions, the normal tendency is for people to forget the decisions.’

Mourinho also hinted that Eden Hazard, who scored in the draw at Southampton and was excellent again here, is being driven out of English football because of persistent fouling.

He added: ‘People in love with football in this country, people must be in love with Eden Hazard. 

Hazard falls after contact with Fazio, who appears to win the ball, so Phil Dowd didn't award the Blues a penalty

‘The way match to match he's being punished by opponents and not protected by referees, maybe one day we won't have Eden Hazard.

‘It's one, two, three, four, five or 10 aggressive fouls against him. They kick and kick and kick, and the kid resists.

‘He's a very honest guy in the way he plays, but that's another problem.’

Chelsea’s bench demanded a red card when they mistakenly believed Federico Fazio had taken out the Chelsea forward when he was in on goal. 

Mourinho continued to berate the officials and referee Phil Dowd after his side weren't awarded a penalty

The Blues boss, complaing to Dowd, failed to contain his anger during the match at White Hart Lane

Mourinho added: ‘Hazard, honest as always, tells me in his opinion that it was not a foul or a red card. So that is good, in spite of the fact Mr Dowd was too slow to follow that ball.

‘He was 40 yards away, but made the right decision. It was the decision when he was 10m away (the penalty) he couldn't make.’

Incredibly Mourinho missed Gary Cahill twice kicking man of the match Harry Kane during an ugly incident in front of both technical areas.

Instead the Chelsea manager snapped: ‘I didn't see that. But it was like the back - not like Sterling in the face?’.

Jose Mourinho complained there was a 'clear campaign' against his Chelsea side following the draw at Southampton. Press Association Sport assessed whether key decisions were fair during the Premier League clash between Tottenham and Chelsea.

OFFSIDE?

Eden Hazard narrowly kept the ball in out wide and whipped a shot past Diego Costa - the striker was being marked by Kyle Walker - which rebounded off the post to Oscar. His shot was tapped in by Costa. Spurs defenders' appeals were in vain.

Decision: Goal for Chelsea. Correct.

HAND OF JAN

Jan Vertonghen fell on to a ball after blocking Oscar's run on to the ball, with the Brazil playmaker and Mourinho appealing for a penalty. No-one else nearby did and referee Phil Dowd was unmoved.

Decision: Play continued. Correct.

ON THE SPOT

Gary Cahill flew in late on Harry Kane and Dowd had no hesitation in pointing to the spot. The Chelsea defender's challenge gave him no choice in the moments before half-time, but Mourinho came out for the second half talking into the official's ear.

Decision: Penalty. Correct.

DISAPPEARING BALLS

Mourinho continually complained in the second half when Hugo Lloris took his time to put the ball back into play with a goal kick.

Decision: Play continued. Mourinho had a point.

HAZARD HACKED?

The Chelsea boss erupted when Hazard burst forwards and went down under the challenge of Federico Fazio. Mourinho complained to fourth official Andre Marriner and wanted a red card as the Spurs defender was the last man, but replays showed Fazio won the ball.

Decision: Play continued. Correct.

SPORTING PLAY

Vertonghen kicked the ball out because Costa took a blow to the head. Rather than return the ball, Fabregas took the throw-in as normal and won a corner, which Spurs cleared.

Decision: Play continued. Grey area, and in Chelsea's favour on this occasion. 

Mourinho continued to unleash his anger towards the linesmen and fourth officials at White Hart Lane

That was a clear reference to Raheem Sterling’s slap on Federico Fernandez during Liverpool’s victory over Swansea, for which he went unpunished.

Mourinho also refused to criticise Manchester City after they signed Frank Lampard for the rest of the season from his parent club New York City.

He added: ‘If UEFA and the Premier League allow it, they allow it. I think any player from the New York team, if Manchester City wants them, they can bring him.

‘If they do it with other players, they do well. If they are allowed to do that, they'll do that.’

The first-half performance was too much for Mourinho as he stormed off down the tunnel before the whistle

Spurs chief Mauricio Pochettino admitted he was stunned by the result as Chelsea slipped to their second defeat of the season.

They were beaten 3-0 at Stamford Bridge on December 3, but this was a convincing performance at White Hart Lane.

He added: ‘The most important thing is to congratulate my players. There was a great atmosphere out on the pitch and for our supporters to.

‘For me, it's only three points. It is a good victory against Chelsea, one of the best teams in the world. But this is nothing. It's only three points.

‘We've started to improve a lot in the last few months. I think that we are more strong now.’
