A seven-year-old boy on his way to school in a notoriously violent district of Cape Town has been shot and wounded, police said.

A gunman opened fire on the first grader and a 17-year-old boy who was with him in the Elsies River suburb on Wednesday.

They were both wounded and a 27-year-old man has been arrested over the shooting, which took place in an area plagued by gang violence.

Cape Town is popular with tourists, but also has a darker side

Police recorded more murders in Cape Town - a popular tourist destination - than in Johannesburg and Pretoria combined between April 2011 and March 2012, according to the Mail & Guardian.

In some instances, locals have taken matters into their own hands.

Deadly: Armed violence in Cape Town is rife

In December last year vigilantes in Cape Town whipped and stoned to death a local ruffian after he was accused of raping a girl of 15 at knifepoint.

A mob from the Crossroads township dragged the 32-year-old from a shebeen just yards from the victim's home after the alleged rape.

They beat him with heavy whips before using rocks to finally bludgeon him to death. His body lay in the road for five hours before paramedics came to remove it.

Communities in some areas are so unstable that the police have had to create patrolled safety corridors for schoolchildren to walk through, according to 9News.

Western Cape Premier Helen Zille, meanwhile, has called for the army to be deployed in the most violent Cape Town districts.

Last August she wrote to Police Minister Nathi Mthethwa, underlining the scale of the problem, the Mail & Guardian reported.

She wrote: 'Principals at Manenberg schools say that absenteeism has increased dramatically due to ongoing gang violence... teachers at Sonderend primary school have reported that only about 200 of 900 learners attended school last week.'Â
