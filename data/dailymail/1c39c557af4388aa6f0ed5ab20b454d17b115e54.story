Paul Lambert launched a furious attack on Tottenham midfielder Ryan Mason after his striker Christian Benteke was sent off in Aston Villa's stormy 2-1 defeat.

Lambert's side were leading 1-0 through Andrea Weimann when the Villa manager claimed Benteke was provoked into shoving Mason following a clash of heads.

He also claimed Spurs defender Jan Vertonghen should have been dismissed after his studs appeared to catch Villa midfielder Ashley Westwood.

Referee Neil Swarbrick took his time to come to a decision, but it seemed the correct one in the end

The Villa manager said: 'I don't condone what Christian did, but my daughter could throw a harder forearm that that.

'The sending off changed the course of the game. I didn't see it at the time but, what was it, a handbag thrown?

'The lad puts his head in Christian's face and I've played the game - the natural instinct is to raise your arm to push it away and that's what he did. He's been punished for that.

'If you put your head in someone's face I can understand why he did it.

'I don't condone it. We didn't deserve to lose because we were excellent.

'I saw the Vertonghen challenge - it was high and I think it was only about throat height.

'The game started to overspill and there were a few challenges like that.

Jan Vertonghen was lucky to escape with just a yellow card for his two-foot challenge on Ashley Westwood 

'It became more feisty. We were playing good football, the tempo was great and we could have been two or three up at half-time.

'I can't speak to the referee because they last time I did that I ended up a but lighter in the pocket.

'I don't mind a physical game, but it has to be within the rules.'

Villa were ahead through Andreas Weimann, but Spurs equalised through Nacer Chadli in the 84th minute and Harry Kane's stunning free kick in injury time won it for Spurs.

Tottenham chief Mauricio Pochettino, who claimed he did not see the Benteke incident, said: 'We needed the three points and we deserved to win.

'I am happy, the team in the second half showed character. I am happy because sometimes you need to get the three points.

'Our position in the table was not good and now we are three points from the Champions League. We know that that situation will be good in the future, but that process takes time.'
