By the gloomy light of our caving headlamps, it looks like a geological rubbish dump: a brown, muddy chaos of shadowy crevices and boulders – some the size of buses – that fell from the roof. Welcome to The Frozen Deep, the biggest cave chamber in Britain, which has recently been discovered below Cheddar Gorge in Somerset.

By the way, I’m the tiny figure in the middle of the photo standing in the distant white glow at the far wall.

Lit properly for the first time by underground photography specialist Gavin Newman, with five of our team spread out across its vastness holding synchronised flashguns, The Frozen Deep is a wonderland featuring pure white stalactite columns – the 20ft one on the left of the picture is the country’s longest.

Beyond this tight section of passage, explorers found the Frozen Deep Chamber

The Frozen Deep is at the far end of a cave system known as Reservoir Hole. It has been explored by cavers since 1951, but no one had ventured beyond an apparently impenetrable rockfall at the end of its main tunnel, which is called the Grand Gallery.

However, a strong draught blowing from the cracks between the boulders suggested that if a way through could somehow be found, there must be more open cavern.

In early 2008, Dr Pete Glanvill, 61, a retired GP and a doyen of the local caving scene, put a team together to take up the challenge.

Armed with hammers, crowbars, drills, explosives and a large quantity of scaffolding, the team probed various blind alleys in search of the elusive chamber.

Finally they began to push at the right spot. With a series of successive breakthroughs starting earlier this year, they reached the end of a squirm they dubbed Hard Times to became the first humans to enter Resurrection, a massive open rift.

The Frozen Deep – which could be accessed from a passage 30ft above the floor – was by now just around the corner.

That
 week Glanvill happened to be on holiday. ‘They waited for me to get 
back before they went down into the chamber,’ he said.  ‘I thought that 
was pretty decent of them.’

It takes a little time to appreciate just how big this chamber is.

To
 get from one end to the other takes close to ten minutes, in part 
because one has to follow a circuitous route laid between strips of 
fluorescent tape in order to avoid damaging the unique crystals and 
cracked mud floors. 

The 
floor area is almost 32,291 square feet – big enough to fit in about six
 of the naves  of nearby Wells Cathedral. Measured by  volume, The 
Frozen Deep is almost 1,412  million cubic feet, against the cathedral’s
 388,000 cubic feet.

Its 
discovery may not be the end of Reservoir Hole’s secrets. At the lowest 
part of the chamber, a small stream flows down a muddy passage that the 
team called Dingley Dell  and into a pit, where the roof dips beneath 
the water’s surface.

Vast: Explorers believe the cave could turn out to be even bigger as they think it is linked to other known underground chambers

Preliminary dives have established that the passage continues underwater, and appears to join a much bigger  tunnel. At this point, Reservoir Hole is very close to Cheddar’s ‘lost river’ – the massive borehole bearing the River Yeo, a major underground watercourse that emerges at the bottom of the gorge.

In the Nineties, cave divers explored it  for more than half a mile, but eventually reached a blockage. ‘The hope now is to get back to the river upstream of that point via Reservoir Hole,’ said team member Martin Grass, 57.

If that happens, perhaps in the next few weeks, it may well be possible to find links with some of the other already-known underground chambers and caves on top of the Mendip Hills, some of them miles away.

Potentially, The Frozen Deep may turn out  to be just a part of one of the greatest cave systems in Europe.
