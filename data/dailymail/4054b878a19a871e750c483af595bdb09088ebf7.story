He may have inherited his mother’s South American looks.

But there is no doubting which side of the family his on-stage prowess comes from.

This is JJ Forsyth-Johnson, Sir Bruce Forsyth’s only child with third wife Wilnelia Merced, pictured for the first time with his heavy metal band JunkCake.

Given that his 85-year-old father is known for his wholesome brand of light family entertainment, it may come as something of a shock to learn that the 25-year-old was thrashing out something altogether more edgy in a dingy London pub.

While Sir Bruce will command an audience of millions this evening when he hosts Strictly Come Dancing, on this occasion JJ managed a smattering of just 12 onlookers, most of whom were decked out in leather and spikes.

Educated at £33,000-a-year Charterhouse School, one of the country’s foremost public schools, the musician took to the stage wearing  a dress shirt and smart trousers while his bandmates were all in jeans and T-shirts.

His performance at the Dublin Castle pub in Camden, north London, is a far cry from his cultured upbringing listening to his father’s jazz records and mother’s favourite salsa songs at the family’s £5m mansion in Surrey.

JJ, real name Jonathan Joseph,  said: ‘My dad has really inspired me. I grew up with jazz, lots and lots of jazz and my mum is into salsa because she is from Puerto Rico, so that was a big part of my childhood. It’s definitely in the blood.

‘I have been playing music for 10 years. It’s always been a hobby. All my family are into music. We are just gigging, we’ve been playing for two years now, just for ourselves. Now we’re looking to the future. We haven’t got any management and we can’t really do it ourselves. We need a bit of guidance.

Talking about his father’s reaction to his music, JJ said: ‘Dad’s heard a bit of it. He knows what we’re up to.

‘It’s not the sort of stuff he’s used to but he supports us in everything we do, he’s great like that. We’re recording and gigging but we’re all doing a lot of different things, so it’s hard to get it going.

‘We’re all busy, but we have massive inspiration.’

The band have told fans on their Facebook page that they model themselves after punk rockers Rage Against the Machine and heavy metal band Metallica.

Earlier this year it was revealed that Sir Bruce’s 32-year-old grandson Luke Purdie is a tattooed, hair-flicking, head-banging lead singer of a heavy metal band called Voodoo Six.

Sir Bruce recently braved an Iron Maiden concert just to see the band at London’s O2 Arena, where they were supporting the US rockers.

Mr Purdie, from Ramsgate, Kent, is the son of Sir Bruce’s second daughter, 55-year-old Julie Forsyth.

He said recently: ‘To him Voodoo is all noise. I thought he would get some bits but he just sees it as a bit too full-on for him. I get his stuff but he doesn’t really get my stuff.’

Mr Purdie’s sister Sophie, 22, has followed in her grandfather’s footsteps, duetting with him on an album Sir Bruce released  in 2011.

Sir Bruce currently commands more than 10m viewers each week on Strictly Come Dancing and also performed to a packed crowd at this year’s Glastonbury Festival.

Last year he entered the Guinness book of World Records for having the longest career as a male TV entertainer. He was recognised for a career that has spanned more than 70 years.

He added recently: ‘Everybody says what a charming young man JJ is. It’s such a thrill that the Forsyths are continuing the showbiz line.’
