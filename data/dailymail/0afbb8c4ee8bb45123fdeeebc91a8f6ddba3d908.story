Stephan Lichtsteiner could tell Eden Hazard and Paul Pogba were going to be special after training with them, and the defender has tipped Kingsley Coman to be the next big thing.

Lichtsteiner played with Hazard at Lille and currently stars alongside Pogba at Juventus, where he feels he is watching 18-year-old forward Coman being sculpted into a special player.

'Eden was there for my last year at Lille,'  Lichtsteiner told the Independent. 'In training you could just see that he was an incredible player, he had something that nobody else had.

'It was the same with Pogba. He arrived at a club that was already winning and he worked hard, learning from [Andrea] Pirlo, [Claudio] Marchisio and [Arturo] Vidal.' 

Asked if he recongises the quality Hazard and Pogba share in any other players, Lichtsteiner said: 'Players like this are not like fish in the sea, but Kingsley Coman has all the attributes to eventually be a very good striker.' 

Lichtsteiner was part of the Juventus team that won 1-0 in Turin last week against Monaco in the Champions League quarter-final first leg.

Only Arturo Vidal's penalty separated the teams that Tuesday night, though Juventus just as importantly avoided conceding an away goal to their French visitors.

Lichtsteiner is expected to line up against Monaco on Wednesday night in Monaco as they look to see out the tie and book their place in the semi-finals.
