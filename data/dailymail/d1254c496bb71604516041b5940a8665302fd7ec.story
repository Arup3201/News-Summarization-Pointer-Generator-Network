Twelve more people are being looked into as part of an ongoing investigation into historic child abuse, it has been claimed

Twelve more public figures including senior policeman and politicians are being investigated over claims of historic sex abuse, sources have revealed. 

Civil servants and local authority chiefs are also among the suspects being considered by police across the UK it was claimed, over allegations of abuse between the Fifites and the Eighties. 

Their names have been passed on to Operation Yewtree among other forces by the investigative reporter who exposed the sustained abuse of children by Jimmy Savile in a documentary two years ago.

Mark Williams Thomas said that unlike those arrested already, new suspects are not celebrities but law makers and enforcers. 

Rolf Harris, Stuart Hall and Max Clifford have all been jailed over sexual abuse carried out decades ago. 

Most recently, Dave Lee Travis was found guilty of assault and handed a suspended sentence of three months which is could be reviewed by the Attorney General.

Williams Thomas, a child protection expert, said: 'I know of another twelve public figures and that is a minimum.

'Sadly some of these people still remain un-touchable because they are so powerful. Whilst huge progress has been made following Savile expose - some very powerful people still need to be brought to justice.' 

Dozens of TV and radio personalities have been looked into as part of the investigation following the exposure of Jimmy Savile's horrific abuse towards children, with scores of women coming forward to reveal their experiences with the men in the past. 

'It just takes one person brave enough to come forward. Then, as the investigations start to unfold, more victims tell their stories,' Mr Williams Thomas added.  

'The names I have supplied are senior police officers, politicians, local authority officials and senior civil servants - people with a lot to lose.

'After Savile I got letter bombs and death threats. That's nothing compared to what you will get with politicians and the like.

'There will be dirty games played, a campaign to undermine those investigations. The only way to do it is through a proper inquiry, to have properly skilled investigators to dig out more evidence.

Rolf Harris (left) was found guilty of 12 counts of indecent assault and Stuart Hall (right) is serving a 30-month sentence 

'There are hundreds of victims. Savile had close to 1,000. Offenders don't offend in isolation, and they continually offend.

'The offences date back to the 1960s, 70s, and 80s. Some go back to the 1950s. The accused are old people now. If we leave it too long they will die or be dying, or have gone senile.'

Earlier this year the head of an inquiry into alleged abuse at Westminster was forced to resign amid claims she herself may have been too close to the scandal.

Retired judge Lady Butler-Sloss, stepped down just days after her appointment following criticism due to her brother, Lord Michael Havers. 

There have been suggestions Lord Havers, the attorney general at the time, failed to investigate after concerns were raised. 

Former Lord Mayor of London, Fiona Woolf, was named as the new head of the independent inquiry last month. 

A spokesman for Metropolitan Police said no new arrests had been made by Operation Yewtree. 

The force does not discuss active investigations when no arrests or charges have been made.
