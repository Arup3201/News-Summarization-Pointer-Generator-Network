Women in Saudi Arabia have posted more photographs and video clips of themselves breaking the law by driving. 

Saudi Arabia is the only country in the world where women are not allowed to drive but a campaign is gathering pace calling for an end to the ban. 

There is no specific law preventing women from getting behind the wheel but they cannot apply for driving licences and have previously been arrested on charges relating to public order or political protest.

Women in Saudi Arabia have been defying the driving ban and are getting support from male drivers

The photos and footage show various women driving on busy streets in the capital Riyadh. 

One clip shows a woman driving in the traditional veil with only her eyes showing but as the footage shows men are supporting an end to the ban by giving her the thumbs-up. 

Activist Eman al-Najfan, known as Saudiwoman on her Twitter page, has been tweeting updates from the campaign.

Another female campaigner, who asked to remain anonymous, said the publication of the video clips and photographs was the first part of a two-stage campaign designed to change attitudes towards women drivers.

Women will be asked to get behind the wheel on October 26 as part of the protest.

She said 'to drive with a licence 
should not be against the law' adding that many Saudis, including senior
officials, had become more open to the idea of women driving.

'The authorities, the country, how people think has changed,' she said.

Conservative supporters of the ban, including members of Saudi Arabia's powerful clerical establishment, have said allowing women to drive will encourage the sexes to mix freely in public 
which would threaten public morality.

Opponents of the ban say it means families have to employ expensive private drivers which makes it 
difficult for women to work or to do many other basic daily tasks.

They also point out that women in rural areas of Saudi Arabia frequently drive without being 
stopped by police.

A female member of the Shoura Council - a body appointed by King Abdullah to advise the government - proposed on Tuesday lifting the ban on women drivers.

The council's transport committee must now decide whether to accept her recommendation and put it to the transport ministry.

Her proposal was widely reported in more liberal parts of the Saudi press and some newspapers 
published opinion pieces arguing that women should be allowed to drive.

Earlier this month a Saudi sheikh warned that driving could affect women's ovaries and pelvises.

Sheikh Salah al-Luhaydan said women would be putting their health at risk if they got behind the wheel.
