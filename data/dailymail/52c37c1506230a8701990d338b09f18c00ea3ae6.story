Meet the woman who has become the first person to scale a city made out of ice.

These breath-taking pictures capture the four-times Ice Climbing World Champion, Ines Papert, climbing frozen buildings in the majestic winter city of Harbin.

In temperatures of minus 20 degrees Celsius by day and minus 30 below at night, it would normally be extremely dangerous to climb frozen ice at such a drastically cold temperature.

But, the buildings, in the north of China, are built from stacks of solid ice blocks, making it easier to grip the freezing surface and become a climber's playground.

Taken by photographer Franz Walter, the pictures show the unique intricate detail of the ice sculptured buildings, in scenes never created before in the Western world.

After being drawn to the famous annual Snow and Ice Festival, Ines, from Germany, said: 'Beside the initial nervousness, the idea of climbing the breathtaking buildings was an attractive proposition.

'My difficulties came when I wanted to secure my rope to the wall.

'The ice was like concrete and it was hard to drive the screws into the wall.

'In no time my fingers and toes were ice cold and numb, but there were plenty of opportunities for me to warm up again. I gained a true respect for the cold.'
