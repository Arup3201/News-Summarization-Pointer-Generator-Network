Ronald Koeman saw his Twitter following explode on Monday after being announced as Southampton manager.

The 51-year-old, who replaces Mauricio Pochettino on a three-year deal at the club, has seen over 100,000 people follow him in the last three days, the majority of them since his appointment.

Koeman tweeted: 'My account has clearly exploded! And has now even exceeded 300,000 followers #unbelievable! Thank you all for following me.'

In the hotseat: Koeman moves to Southampton after leaving Dutch outfit Feyenoord last season

The former Feyenoord boss becomes the second current Premier League manager on twitter, joining Swansea's Gary Monk. Pepe Mel, who left West Brom after a short spell last season, also used the social media site.

But while Monk has only a modest 21,000 followers, and Mel has 131,000, Koeman has seen his account grow rapidly since being linked with Saint Mary's. Last Saturday he reached 100,000 followers and on Friday he tweeted to celebrate passing 200,000.

On Monday evening, following a day of intense media coverage, the Dutchman has now topped 300,000.

Optimistic: Koeman will hope his managerial reputation will expand in the same was as his online presence

Koeman, who won the European Championship with Holland and the European Cup with PSV in 1988 and with Barcelona four years later as a player, has also managed Ajax, Benfica, PSV Eindhoven, Valencia and AZ Alkmaar.
