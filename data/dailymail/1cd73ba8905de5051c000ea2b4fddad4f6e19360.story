Brothers in arms: Olympic cyclist Bradley Wiggins is set to make a cameo appearance on a new single with his hero Paul Weller

Olympic cycling hero Sir Bradley Wiggins is to reunite his heroes The Jam for a one-off recording 30 years after the band split. 

The gold medal and Tour de France winner, 32, is set to bring together frontman Paul Weller and bassist Bruce Foxton to re-record a version of the song Window Shopping, according to the Daily Mirror.

Guitarist Steve Cropper and Russell Hastings - lead singer of From The Jam - will also join the group for the session next month.

A source told the Daily Mirror: 'It’s all incredibly exciting and has been in the pipeline for some time.

'Everything has finally been signed off though, and a date set for mid-February.'

Paul Weller, 54, has reportedly organised the recording in his Surrey studio and the five of them will also record a video for the track.

Sir Bradley Wiggins, who was knighted in the New Year's honours list, is known for his love of rock music,especially the Modfather's band The Jam.

The source added: 'Bradley is due on a training camp abroad on the afternoon of the session, so he is doing his bit first thing.

'He will be joining his boyhood heroes, Bruce and Steve, on guitar with a small cameo, and as well as lending his studio, Paul will chip in on instrumentals, while Russell will be on vocals.

'Bruce and Paul are getting on really well and although there are certainly no immediate plans for a Jam reunion, stranger things have happened.'

The original version of Window Shopping was released in October on Foxton’s album, Back In The Room, which Weller played a number of instruments on, including the glockenspiel.

Sir Bradley was introduced to his idol last year and the pair are said to have stayed in touch.

After a triumphant year winning a gold medal at the Olympics and the Tour de France, his crowning glory saw him take the Sports Personality of the Year gong in December.

And he delighted fans by playing guitar in an impromptu performance of The Jam classic, That’s Entertainment at an after-party.

And last month he also joined former frontman Weller on stage at the Hammersmith Apollo during a Christmas fundraiser in West London.
