'Grim day': Rt Rev Justin Welby, the incoming Archbishop of Canterbury is under pressure to make changes

The heads of the Church of England are under pressure to seek help from outside mediators as anger grows over the vote against women bishops.

Justin Welby, the next Archbishop of 
Canterbury, also faces calls from senior bishops to resolve the issue as
 soon as possible rather than wait.

The Archbishops' Council is due to meet next week to discuss the gaping chasm that has opened within the Church after Tuesday's controversial decision.

Sources within the council are urging the use of professional mediators after an angry response from female clergy to the 'slap in the face' from the Synod.

Church leaders have warned a fresh vote 
on the issue may not be possible before 2015, with any changes not being made until 2020, but Government sources have 
made it clear they wanted to see action much more quickly.

Bishop Welby, who had a career in business before being ordained, is likely to acquiesce after warnings that the row could lead to the disestablishment of the Church, according to The Times.

David Cameron yesterday warned the Church of England to think again about its ‘very sad’ rejection of women bishops, as MPs called for Parliament to intervene directly.

In a strongly worded rebuke, the Prime Minister said it was time for the Church to ‘get with the programme’ or risk looking dangerously out of touch with modern society.

He said: ‘I’m very clear, the time is right for women bishops, it was right many years ago, they need to get on with it as it were and get with the programme, but you do have to respect the individual institutions and the way they work, while giving them a sharp prod.’

Former Labour culture secretary Ben Bradshaw said: ‘If the Synod can’t sort it out, we need to help them. We cannot allow this to drag on for another ten years.

'It’s simply not sustainable, it’s not tolerable to the vast majority of Anglicans in this country and the vast majority of the English public who support women bishops and simply cannot understand how this is allowed to happen.’ 

Labour’s Frank Field was one of at least two MPs yesterday proposing legislation that would remove the Church’s exemption from equality law, meaning it could be sued for discrimination against women.

Yesterday both Dr Rowan Williams, the current Archbishop of Canterbury, and the Right Reverend Justin Welby, who will assume the post at the end of year, admitted that the rejection of women bishops had left the Church out of step with society.

Dr Welby said it was a ‘very grim day’, while Dr Williams said the Church had been ‘wilfully blind’ to the priorities of most people.

The two prelates summed up the impact of the narrow defeat of just six votes.

Even some among the 74 who voted against women bishops called for a peace and reconciliation process to try to reach agreement.

Philip Giddings, chairman of the House of Laity, said: 'We need to take as long as it takes.'

As well as the threatening response from politicians, bishops expect the Church to suffer a major loss of face with the public.

A source close to Culture Secretary Maria Miller, who is also minister for women and equality, said: ‘Whilst this is a matter for the Church, it’s very disappointing. As we seek to help women fulfil their potential throughout society this ruling would suggest the Church is at the very least behind the times.’

Labour frontbencher Chris Bryant, a former vicar, said the Government should consider ending the Church’s exemption from equality laws. He also called for a ban on the appointment of new bishops until the issue was resolved.

He went on: ‘Maybe we should be introducing our own parliamentary Bill to allow for women bishops that is just straightforward and clear – it would still have to go to Synod but we could maybe start the process.’

Defence Secretary Philip Hammond said the Church of England needed to clarify its position on women bishops or risk becoming ‘marginalised’.

Mr Hammond warned the Church was ‘in crisis’, adding: ‘It’s not just on the ordination of women, but a series of big divisive issues which the Church has to resolve, it has to heal, it has to find a way forward.’

The Church’s parliament, the General Synod, blocked the promotion of women by a tiny margin on Tuesday.

Under its rules, there can be no reconsideration until a new Synod has been elected, which will not happen until 2015 – although there is an emergency process that could bring it forward.
