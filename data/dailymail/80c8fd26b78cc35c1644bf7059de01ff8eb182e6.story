Two crew members shooting an upcoming NBC series in Morocco were injured earlier this week in a 'random mugging', sources close to the show tell Daily Mail Online.

The fight happened Tuesday night, as a first assistant director and make-up artist were walking back  dinner to their apartment in Marrakech Plaza. 

A group of youths allegedly approached the two and attempted to rob them, and got into a fight when the filmmakers tried to defend themselves, Deadline reports. 

Both crew members were reportedly hospitalized for their injuries - one with a few cuts, the other with a broken arm.

NBC has not identified the workers, but a source close to the show says one received a few cuts and the other worker suffered a broken arm. The two were walking back to their apartment in Marrakech Plaza (a general view of the area pictured above)

'They had to go to hospital with some broken hands but hopefully they will be OK,' line producer Ahmed Abounouom told Deadline. 

'This could have happened anywhere in the world. It was not on the set and it had nothing to do with the project.'

NBC has refused to identify the workers, but a source close to the show says its not believed that either are American since most of the crew working on set in Morocco are not from the U.S.

The incident did not take place on set, and filming has continued on schedule.  

Odyssey premieres on NBC on April 5. The series stars Pushing Daisies' Anna Friel as a female soldier in North Africa dealing with an international conspiracy. Twilight's Peter Facinelli  plays an attorney. Jake Robinson, of the Carrie Diaries, also starts on the show.

Morocco has recently become a hub for Hollywood productions looking to film in a Middle Eastern or exotic location, since it is more stable than its other North African neighbors. 

Recent productions that have shot in the country include American Sniper, Game of Thrones and Mission: Impossible 5.
