Luis Suarez is yet to apologise for his bite on Giorgio Chiellini – but if one does arrive then expect it to include justification for his actions.

For the Uruguayan – twice guilty of sinking his teeth into an opponent – is yet to master the art of a sincere sorry.

In 2010, following his bite on PSV's Otman Bakkal while playing for Ajax in the Eredivise – for which he received a seven-game ban - Suarez’s apology attempted to explain the indiscretion.

‘In those moments you can only feel your heart beating strong, you are not able to think about what you are going to do and after you just feel bad and regret,’ he said.

Three years later and in the wake of his attack on Chelsea’s Branislav Ivanovic, the Liverpool striker questioned the length of the 10-game ban served upon him.

‘I would like to explain to everybody that I decided to accept the ban because – while 10 games is clearly greater than those bans given in past cases where players have actually been seriously injured – I acknowledge that my actions were not acceptable on the football pitch,’ he said in a statement.

In 2011, Suarez received an eight-game suspension and was fined £40,000 for racially abusing Manchester United’s Patrice Evra having called him a ‘negro’ during a match at Anfield.

Again, though, his apology was far from contrite.

‘I admitted to the commission that I said a word in Spanish once, and only once,’ he explained.

‘I never, ever used this word in a derogatory way and if it offends anyone then I want to apologise for that.’

He was also forced to issue an apology when he refused to shake hands with Evra in the corresponding fixture at Old Trafford.

Meanwhile, at the 2010 World Cup when he was red carded for handling on the line to deny Ghana a winning goal, Suarez later admitted he would do the same again after Uruguay went on to win the quarter-final tie.

And Suarez’s latest reaction is to play down the incident with Italy defender Chiellini, which occurred during the closing stages of Uruguay's 1-0 victory on Tuesday, a win which sends them into the second round.

The 27-year-old said: ‘These situations happen on the field.

'I had contact with his shoulder, nothing more, things like that happen all the time.’

FIFA have confirmed they have opened disciplinary proceedings against Suarez and the player and Uruguay have until 9pm on Wednesday to provide evidence.

If Suarez is found guilty of biting Chiellini, however, then expect his apology to be delivered through gritted teeth.

Following his bite on PSV's Otman Bakkal in 2010...

‘I feel very sorry about what happened to me against PSV.

‘I apologise to Bakkal and to all Ajax supporters.

‘Being the captain, I am aware I didn’t make the right decision.

‘I did something wrong. In those moments you can only feel your heart beating strong, you are not able to think about what you are going to do and after you just feel bad and regret.

‘I am very self-critical and I do know I’m not like that.’

Following the ruling that he had racially abused Patrice Evra in 2011...

‘I admitted to the commission that I said a word (negro) in Spanish once, and only once.

‘I never, ever used this word in a derogatory way and if it offends anyone then I want to apologise for that.

‘I told the panel members that I will not use it again on a football pitch in England.’

Following his refusal to shake hands with Evra in 2012...

'I have spoken with the manager (Kenny Dalglish) since the game at Old Trafford and I realise I got things wrong.

'I have not only let (Dalglish) down but also the club and what it stands for and I'm sorry. I made a mistake and I regret what happened.

'I should have shaken Patrice Evra's hand before the game and I want to apologise for my actions. I would like to put this whole issue behind me and concentrate on playing football.'

Following his bite on Chelsea's Branislav Ivanovic in 2013...

‘I am truly very sorry about the incident with Branislav Ivanovic.

‘I hope that all the people who I offended at Anfield last Sunday will grant me forgiveness and I again repeat my apology to Branislav. I would like to explain to everybody that I decided to accept the ban because – while 10 games is clearly greater than those bans given in past cases where players have actually been seriously injured – I acknowledge that my actions were not acceptable on the football pitch.

‘So I do not want to give the wrong impression to people by making an appeal.’
