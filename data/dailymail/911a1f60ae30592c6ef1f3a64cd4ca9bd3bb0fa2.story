Lawyers for Gable Tostee, the 28-year-old  man accused of murdering New Zealand woman, Warriena Wright, on the Gold Coast in August may not proceed with his bail application in the Brisbane Supreme Court tomorrow.

The hearing is still listed for 10am on Tuesday, November 18, but Robertson O'Gorman, the new firm appointed by Tostee following his first bail hearing had thrown the application date in doubt.

Warriena Tagpuno Wright, 26, fell to her death from the balcony of Tostee's 14th-floor luxury apartment at around 2.20am on August 8, hours following a night together after they met at Cavill Mall in Surfers Paradise via the mobile dating app Tinder.

Mr Tostee was arrested a week later and has been in custody since.  Following the first, adjourned part of his bail hearing, Tostee replaced his original legal team with renowned Queensland civil liberties lawyer, Terry O'Gorman.

Mr Tostee denies he murdered Ms Wright.  Mr O'Gorman refused to confirm or deny to Daily Mail Australia whether the bail hearing would proceed, however he told the brisbane times he was 'uncertain' and that the application was 'a work in progress'.

Mr Tostee appointed Mr O'Gorman following the civil libertarian's comments about the release of court documents including an alleged transcript of Ms Wright's night with him, taped on his phone, and a damning police affidavit of what occurred between the two in the hours before Ms Wright's death.

Mr Tostee is in custody and an application for bail may now be postponed

Mr O'Gorman described as 'absolutely worrying' police claims in the affidavit filed in the Brisbane Supreme Court, which included that Mr Tostee and Ms Wright allegedly had a fight before she fell.

The police affidavit was among eleven documents filed for Gable Tostee's first bail application, before  Justice Debra Mullins, who adjourned the matter to give Mr Tostee's defence team more time.

Crown Prosecutor Sarah Farnden told that hearing Mr Tostee was unlikely to have been on the balcony when Ms Wright plunged 14 storeys to her death.

Justice Mullins described the Crown prosecutor's case for murder as 'weak' and 'difficult', but said a case of manslaughter would be 'strong'.

Justice Mullins said a diagnosis of autism for Gable Tostee could have a bearing on how the court viewed what allegedly happened inside his Surfers Paradise apartment on the night Ms Wright died.

'If your client was not on the balcony, it makes the murder case a lot more difficult,' she told Mr Tostee's defence, 'but in the context of what happened in the apartment, I would think a manslaughter case is not weak.'

No medical files about Mr Tostee's alleged autism condition, nor any additional documents have been filed for Mr Tostee's bail application since the appointment of his new lawyers.
