An Australian man accused of robbing a U.S. bank on New Year's Eve has told jurors in an emotional opening statement that the robbery was justified because he gave much of the money to the homeless.

Corey Donaldson, an author of self-help books, is accused of robbing a Wyoming bank of $140,000 by claiming explosives were planted around the building.

Donaldson, 39, is acting as his own attorney in federal court. He claims the robbery was a protest at the banks bailout during the financial crisis.

'I must say, I feel like a frightened child,' he said. 'I feel there's a lot of people who want to cut my throat.'

Corey Donaldson robbed the U.S. Bank in Jackson, Wyoming on New Year's Eve. He claims he was justified in doing so because he gave the money to the homeless.

Donaldson, a legal resident in the States, said he was the second of 11 children and grew up in the country outside Melbourne, only to see his father lose his home to bank foreclosure.

Donaldson said he became homeless late last year, coming face-to-face with people who were on the streets because of bank foreclosures.

'I came up with the idea that since the banks had been bailed out, and the people had not, I was going to confiscate money from US Bank in Jackson and redistribute it to the poor and homeless in America,' Donaldson said.

'And that's what I did.'

The U.S. District judge ruled last week that Donaldson, whose books include Don't You Dare Get Married Until You Read This, cannot argue to the jury that he was justified in robbing the bank.

Jared Thomas Williams, branch manager of the bank, testified that Donaldson met him in his office on the day of the robbery.

He said Donaldson told him members of a Mexican cartel were outside the building and were prepared to blow it up if Williams didn't turn over $2million in cash.

He said Donaldson told him: 'There were four military-grade explosives that had been buried in the snow, and they were prepared to detonate them.'

Williams said he loaded $140,000, nearly all the cash in the bank, into a duffel bag and gave it to Donaldson.

Donaldson later asked Williams, 'If you knew there were foreclosed people on the streets who feel that way every day, how would you feel about it?'

Prosecutor Todd Shugart objected, and Johnson ruled that Williams shouldn't answer.

Investigators began looking for Donaldson after piecing together information from surveillance cameras in and around the bank.

Authorities arrested him when his longtime friend Kevin Lee Day called police after Donaldson turned up at his home in late January.

Day testified that he and Donaldson have been close friends for 16 years. He said Donaldson told him where to find $8,000 after the robbery.

Day said he became emotional when he received the money, and that it came at a good time because he faced losing his Utah house to foreclosure.

Investigators testified Tuesday that they recovered about $30,000 after Donaldson's arrest.

Donaldson told an FBI agent shortly after his arrest that he had intended to surrender.

The case continues.
