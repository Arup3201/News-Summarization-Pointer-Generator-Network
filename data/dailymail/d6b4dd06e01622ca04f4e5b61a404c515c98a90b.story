The tiny spider that builds elaborate sculptures of itself from dead insects, debris and leaves has been caught on film.

The artful arthropod was spotted in Peru in 2012 and is said to craft these decoys in a bid to fool predators and avoid being eaten.

The spider is believed to be a new species of Cyclosa - a genus which includes other sculpting arachnids, but none of which of which have been observed to build replicas with multiple, spidery legs.

The tiny spider that builds elaborate sculptures of itself from dead insects has been caught on film for what's believed to be the first time ever. During one shot, YouTube user SmarterEveryDay shows the spider decoy, and an image of the creature side-by-side, pictured, to show just how alike the fake is to the original

Biologist and science teacher Phil 
Torres discovered the apparently novel spider in September 2012 as he 
led tourists in a floodplain surrounding Peru's Tambopata Research 
Centre.

'From afar, it 
appears to be a medium sized spider about an inch across, possibly dead 
and dried out, hanging in the center of a spider web along the side of 
the trail,' he wrote in a blog post at the time for eco-tourism firm Rainforest Expeditions.

In the new video, released by YouTube user SmarterEveryDay, the spider and its decoy is caught on camera during an expedition to the same region of southeastern Peru.

During
 one shot, SmarterEveryDay placed an image of the spider decoy with the image of the 
creature side-by-side to show just how alike the fake is to the 
original.

The spider and its decoy, pictured, was caught on camera during an expedition to the Tambopata Macaw Project in Peru. It is said to be a new species of Cyclosa, a genus which includes other sculpting arachnids but none of which of which have been observed to build replicas with multiple, spidery legs

During another, the spider decoy glows in the light from the camera, which also acts to highlight its long, spindly legs.

Following the initial discovery, Torres contacted Linda Raynor, an arachnologist at Cornell University, 
who agreed it was an unusual find. She told Wired it was likely to be an
 unidentified species.

Even 
among the decoy-building species of Cyclosa, she said, decoys with legs 
and the web-shaking behaviour have not been observed before.

After
 speaking with experts, Torres returned to the trails around 
Tambopata and found a further 25 specimens of the novel spider in the 
same floodplain.

The spider (pictured left in close up) was first spotted in 2012 in Peru, and was later found separately in the Philippines by entomologist Lary Reeves. Biologists are curious as to how two similar creatures, so far apart, have both managed to evolve this defence mechanism

William Eberhard, an entomologist at the Smithsonian Tropical Research Institute who studies web-building, said he had never before seen a structure like the ones found in the Amazonian.

Cyclosa are known for decoy building, but most of their constructions are clumpy rather than something which resembles and actual spider.

'Known Cyclosa don’t have that spider-with-leg looking thing, which is why we think it’s a new species,' Torres said.

He hopes to return to the area in January with a permit to collect samples, in preparation for submitting a study and getting the new species officially recognised.

The spider was also found separately in the Philippines by entomologist Lary Reeves in March 2012.
