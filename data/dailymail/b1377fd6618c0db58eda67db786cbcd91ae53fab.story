Jordan Henderson made his 150th appearance for Liverpool on Tuesday night.

Considering the midfielder was doubted early on in his Liverpool career, after a £16million move from Sunderland in 2011, he quickly amassed that total in just over three years at the club. That form has earned him a spot as an England regular.

Emile Heskey was in the BT Sport studio working as a pundit — pictured with fellow Foxes hero Gary Lineker  — having played a decade of his career at Leicester and Liverpool. 

At Leicester he was a powerful, pacy striker who filled defenders with fear. 

At Liverpool he became known for falling over a lot.

There were short, one-line descriptions of every Liverpool player on the back of Tuesday night’s match programme. 

Mario Balotelli, absent due to injury, was described as an ‘enigmatic Italian international striker’. 

Referring to him as perplexing and mysterious — definitions of enigmatic — is putting it mildly, especially given the latest storm surrounding the player. One of many since his summer move.

Simon Mignolet – Liverpool's Dr Jekyll and Mr Hyde player – had one of his off nights. 

At times for Liverpool he has been magnificent, at others he has been diabolical. 

He had already gifted Esteban Cambiasso an open goal, which the Leicester player missed, before being beaten twice until the ball cannoned off the post and went in off the hapless keeper.

This was the 100th meeting between the two sides. Including Tuesday night, they have met 89 times in the league, 10 in the FA Cup, and once in the League Cup. 

Leicester have 35 wins and 126 goals to Liverpool's 42 victories and 155 strikes. The leading scorers in this fixture are Leicester's Ernie Hine, a forward who was prolific in the early 1900s, Liverpool's Gordon Hodgson, from the same era, and Merseyside legend Ian Rush, all on nine.
