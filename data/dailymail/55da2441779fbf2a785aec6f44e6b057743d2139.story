Failed BBC director general George Entwistle may have been sacked had he not done the 'honourable' thing and quit after just 54 days in the job, Lord Patten has admitted.

The BBC Trust's chairman said he and other board members were poised to consider the 'option of termination' but instead agreed to pay him his £450,000 salary for the next year if he left.

Lord Patten has been engulfed in a political row after signing off Entwistle's £1.32million severance package, which includes a £877,000 pension pot, as MPs have called it 'unjustifiable and unacceptable' and a 'reward for failure'.

Entwistle quit on Saturday when Newsnight apologised for smearing Lord McAlpine after they accused a senior political figure of being a paedophile, which led to the Tory peer being wrongly named online as the man who abused children at a care home near Wrexham, north Wales.

Hours before his resignation he had a series of disastrous interviews where he maintained he 
would not leave the BBC as he had 'a job to do', but then quit with a bumper pay deal.

Package: George Entwistle quit the BBC on Saturday and will get his annual salary of £450,000 plus a £877,000 pension pot

Under the terms of his contract, Entwistle was entitled to only six months' pay, but the trust said that the additional payment had been agreed as a reflection of his continuing involvement with the various BBC inquiries now under way.

Justifying the deal in a letter the John Whittingdale, chair of the Commons' media select committee, Lord Patten claims it was for the good of the BBC.

Pressure: Lord Patten signed off Entwistle's generous deal that has put his job under threat and caused fury from MPs

'The alternative was long drawn-out discussions and continuing 
uncertainty at a time when the BBC needs all of its focus to be on 
resolving fundamental issues of trust in BBC journalism,' he added.

'In the absence of George's honourable offer to resign, I would have had to speak to the trustees about the option of termination by us (which, fortunately, was not necessary).

'In
these circumstances, George would have been entitled to 12 months' 
notice. In circumstances where we needed to conclude matters quickly and
required George's ongoing co-operation in a number of very difficult 
and sensitive matters, including the inquiries into issues associated 
with (Jimmy) Savile, I concluded that a consensual resignation on these 
terms was clearly the better route.'

In an urgent session in the Commons on 
the issues, asked for by Labour, Media Minister Maria Miller said his 
payoff was 'hard to justify' and suggested the public spending watchdog could probe the package.

'The National Audit Office is empowered to conduct a value for money review of any issue. If they decide to review this decision, I expect that the BBC would co-operate fully,' she told the Commons,' she said.

'The circumstances of his departure make it hard to justify the level of severance money that has been agreed.

Debate: Media Minister Maria Miller said in the Commons that Entwistle's payoff could be probed by the National Audit Office who would consider if it represented value for money

'Contractual arrangements are a matter for the BBC Trust, but the Trust also has clear responsibilities to ensure value for money for the licence fee payer.'

The National Audit Office confirmed this 
afternoon it will talk to BBC Trust over possible value for money review
over George's Entwistle payoff.

Tory MP Richard Bacon, a member of 
the Commons Public Accounts Committee, said the BBC should be open to 
the same scrutiny as any other public institution.

Angry: Labour deputy leader Harriet Harman said Entwistle should hand half his package back

In a question to the Culture Secretary, he said the National Audit Office's boss, comptroller and auditor-general Amyas Morse, should have 'unfettered' access to the Corporation's accounts so he could investigate whether there were any irregularities in Mr Entwistle's payout.

Philip Davies, Tory MP for Shipley, said the chairman of the BBC Trust had been ‘asleep at the wheel’ during the crisis at the BBC.

In a question to Ms Miller, he said: ‘Lord Patten has wasted hundreds of thousands of pounds on the appointment process for George Entwistle.

‘He's now wasted hundreds of thousands of pounds paying him off and saying that he wasn't up to the job, he was overwhelmed by the job, and he was right to resign.

‘Lord Patten has been asleep at the wheel. He has been off the pace right from the word go. He is part of the problem rather than the solution.’

Senior Tory John Redwood branded the pay-off ‘outrageous’, while Labour's Paul Farrelly of Newcastle-under-Lyme said it was ‘misjudged’.

Conservative Rob Wilson of Reading East said he was concerned such large golden goodbyes could be used by the BBC to ensure the silence of former employees who might otherwise cause embarrassment.

Labour's deputy leader Harriet Harman called on Mr Entwistle to return half the money, adding: 'The BBC Trust cannot justify a payoff of double the amount laid down in his contract.

'George Entwistle should reflect on this and only take that to which he is entitled.'

She
said it was 'disgraceful' that Newsnight's report led to Lord McAlpine 
being branded a child sex offender, 'a damning accusation which could 
only have caused him and his family untold distress'.

Mayor of London Boris Johnson has hit out at the 'shoddy' and 'cretinous' BBC journalists who smeared Lord McAlpine.

In his Daily Telegraph column he said that the corporation was in 'grief' at its own failures but should be doing more to apologise to the Tory peer.

'It’s tragic for us! say Beeb journalists, who are all interviewing each other in a ludicrous orgy of self-pity. In all this nauseating navel-gazing and narcissism, there seems to be no one – from Lord Patten downwards – who appears to be remotely interested in the person the BBC has injured. Has anyone even begun to apologise, in a fitting manner, to Alistair McAlpine?' he wrote.

Boris also added that Lord Patten should say sorry to Lord McAlpine personally.

'The journalism was so shoddy, so cretinous, so ready to let the wish be father to the thought that the Beeb really now has to show that Newsnight was not acting with malice,' he said.

'The BBC cannot minimise what the programme has done. There will be people out there who will continue to believe that there is no smoke without fire, that Newsnight would never have broadcast such allegations unless there was something in it.

'The BBC owes it to McAlpine to grovel and keep grovelling until the public gets the message. Everyone associated with the “paedophile” segment on Newsnight should be sacked instantly.

'Then Chris Patten should make a penitential pilgrimage to McAlpine’s Italian B&B, on his knees and scourging himself with a copy of the BBC charter. This tragedy is not about the BBC; it is about the smearing of an innocent man. The BBC needs to grasp that first.'

But
Ms Harman, seen as a cheerleader for reform of how the press is 
regulated in the run-up to Lord Justice Leveson's report into standards 
and practices of the press, attacked the corporation's media rivals for 
'pouncing' on its latest crisis.

'The BBC is a loved and trusted institution but it has enemies waiting to pounce,' said the deputy Labour leader.

She
called on the Government to 'stand up against the commercial 
competitors and political opponents who are lining up to attack and 
wound the BBC at this moment of crisis'.

She
added: 'The BBC has made grave mistakes and it must sort them out, but 
everyone, including us politicians, must keep cool heads and let that 
happen.'

Prime Minister David Cameron's official spokesman also said today it was 'hard to justify' the £450,000 payoff to Mr Entwistle.

Asked whether Mr Cameron backed the payout to Mr Entwistle, the spokesman said: 'That is clearly a matter for the BBC Trust and it is an issue where they will need to justify that payment to licence fee payers.

'Clearly it is hard to justify a sizeable payoff of that sort, but that is a matter for the BBC Trust and it is for them to justify.'

He said it was 'a matter for George Entwistle' whether he chose to accept the money.

Asked how the PM felt recent events had impacted on the reputation of the BBC, the spokesman said: 'It is important that the BBC grip this and that credibility and public trust are restored.'

The move was greeted with anger and disbelief by MPs. The chairman of the Commons Culture, Media and Sport Committee, John Whittingdale, said the trust had to explain how it could justify such a large pay-off.

'A lot of people will be very surprised that somebody who was in the job for such a short period of time and then had to leave in these circumstances should be walking away with £450,000 of licence fee payers' money,' he said.

'Certainly I would want to know from the trust why they think that's appropriate. I find it very difficult to see a justification for that amount of money to be paid to somebody who has had to resign in these circumstances.

'I wouldn't have thought that just because you have to help an inquiry into the Savile allegations you necessarily need to be paid a such a large amount of money.'

Harriet Harman MP, Labour's Shadow Secretary of State for Culture, Media and Sport, added: 'It is not justifiable for the BBC to pay double the contractually required sum to the director general on his resignation. It looks like a reward for failure.

'George Entwistle should decline to accept any more than is required under his contract.

'This is not the way to restore public confidence in the BBC.'

Gerry Sutcliffe MP, another member of the culture, media and sport committee, said Entwistle's severance packagewas 'symptomatic of the problems around the BBC', adding: 'He has not had time to make an impact and to get that amount of money is ridiculous.'

He also said that Entwistle should 'think twice' before taking it.

Media Minister Maria Miller questioned the size of the severance payment.

'This is a large amount of money, and tough to justify considering the circumstances of Mr Entwistle's departure and his contractual arrangements,' she said.
