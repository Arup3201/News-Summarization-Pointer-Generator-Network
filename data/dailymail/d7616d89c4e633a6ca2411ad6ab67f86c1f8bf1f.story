Paris Saint-Germain goalscorer David Luiz apologised for celebrating his goal against former club Chelsea as the English side exited the Champions League following a 2-2 draw at Stamford Bridge.

Chelsea were eliminated as the tie went into extra-time as 10-man PSG twice came from behind to win an ill-tempered last-16 tie on away goals.

The first leg was drawn 1-1 and Chelsea's advantage grew when Zlatan Ibrahimovic was sent off after 31 minutes.

The Brazilian defender couldn't hide his emotion, but later apologised for celebrating against his former team

Luiz said he was sorry that he had celebrated, but that he had been unable to control himself in the moment

Gary Cahill's strike nine minutes from the end of normal time was cancelled out by former Chelsea defender Luiz, but the hosts went ahead for a second time through an Eden Hazard penalty early in extra-time.

PSG captain Thiago Silva, who conceded the spot-kick for handball, was denied from a corner by Thibaut Courtois but then netted with a header moments later to make it 2-2 on the night and send the visitors through.

'I think we played a great game,' Luiz told Sky Sports 5. 'When we lost Ibra, our best player, you say "keep it simple". Play the ball to feet and keep possession as we need to score to qualify. It was amazing tonight the spirit. Every single player gave everything.

The powerful header took the game into an extra 30 minutes, in which Thiago Silva scored the crucial goal

Luiz sinks to his knees at the final whistle, celebrating the win for his new club against his old employers

'I finished at Chelsea and then I got a great opportunity from PSG - they gave me a great opportunity to continue my career and I was very happy at Chelsea and won titles here but I finished and then I respect everyone.

'It was good for me to score. I said before I didn't celebrate but there as so much emotion I cannot control (it) and sorry because I celebrated because of the emotion but I am so happy to qualify.'

In a feisty contest, Luiz clashed with his former manger Jose Mourinho after Zlatan Ibrahimovic was sent off

Luiz and Diego Costa came together several times, and the Brazilian defender was lucky not to be dismissed
