Social media has reacted after Channel 7 managed to let a questionable name appear on screen during one of Australia’s biggest charity telethons.

TV hosts stood by unaware that philanthropist Hugh G. Rection made a generous donation of $32.38, which earned his name some valuable screen time.

Twitter users were quick to identify the blunder.

In a record breaking effort The Royal Children’s Hospital’s Good Friday Appeal managed to rake in over $17.1 million that will be put towards vital research and facilities to benefit their young patients.

The massive effort foreshadowed the $16.8 million donated at last year’s event.

While a host of people rattled tins for donations around 1500 volunteers were madly counting the offerings. 

Every year the Good Friday Appeal calls on people from all parts of the community to help raise much needed funds to support the work of The Royal Children’s Hospital.
