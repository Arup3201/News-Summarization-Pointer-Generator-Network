The wife of Jeremy Forrest has told a jury how 'he tucked me in' and 'told me that he loved me' on the night before the teacher fled to France with his schoolgirl lover.

Emily Forrest also revealed that her estranged husband had also texted her the next morning saying: 'Don’t worry I’ll call you tomorrow. I love you’ as he boarded a Channel ferry with his student girlfriend.

The 32-year-old also admitted that she had warned Forrest to cut off contact with the pupil before they eloped.

Mrs Forrest had earlier fled the dock at Lewes Crown Court in tears yesterday as she described their last meal together on the evening before he left her.

She gestured at her 
estranged husband sitting a few yards away in the dock, saying ‘It’s 
really distracting’, before breaking down and being escorted from the 
witness box.

Judge Michael 
Lawson QC called for a break in the trial at Lewes Crown Court as the 
32-year-old stood with her back to the court weeping.

It was the first 
time Mrs Forrest had seen her husband since he allegedly absconded to 
France with his 15-year-old pupil last September and spent eight days on
the run.

When Mrs Forrest returned to the court 
half an hour later she continued to give evidence behind a red curtain 
hidden from her husband’s gaze.

She told the court she and her husband
of a year had returned to the marital home in Ringmer, East Sussex, 
after dining in Lewes town centre on September 19. ‘I went to bed and 
Jeremy kind of tucked me in. He told me that he loved me.’ she said.

‘When I left in the morning I was in 
quite a good mood because Jeremy told me he loved me so I was like 
pestering him in bed, just being silly, just singing.’

She said her mood
turned to anger when 30-year-old Forrest texted her to say he would not
be home that evening and would miss a meal with her family.

They later tried to telephone each 
other and, after missing each other’s calls, Forrest sent a text saying:
‘Don’t worry I’ll call you tomorrow. I love you.’

The text is believed to have been sent
minutes after Forrest boarded a Channel ferry with the schoolgirl, the 
court has previously heard.

Mrs Forrest also told how just a week 
before her husband vanished they had a ‘really good evening’ at a 
concert in Tunbridge Wells.

‘He said that I looked young. He said I looked 21. He was suggesting that was a good thing,’ she said.

She told the court their marriage had 
been in difficulty and they had had sex only once in the four months 
before his disappearance. She said: ‘He was staying out a lot more, 
drinking a lot of alcohol, coming back in the morning, not telling me 
where he was. It was hard.’

She said Forrest started using his Twitter account and she noticed that he was sending messages to pupils at his school.

Despite the problems, Forrest raised 
the subject of them having children together during the 2012 summer 
holidays, she told the court.

She said: ‘Jeremy brought it up quite a
lot – “When are we going to have kids? And do you want kids?”. I just 
thought it was a bit weird because the relationship wasn’t great.’

The court has been told Forrest 
started having sex with the schoolgirl, whose identity is protected by 
law, around the start of June 2012.

Earlier, the child’s mother said she 
feared the worst after her daughter vanished last September. Trembling 
and clasping her hands as she gave evidence, she said: ‘I thought she 
was dead. And I did ask the police that as well.’

The girl’s mother also told how 
Forrest phoned her in July, a few weeks before he allegedly abducted 
her, to quash rumours that were involved in some way.

She said: ‘I had never spoken to him 
before. He said that there had been rumours at school that him and the 
girl had been having a relationship and he was seriously concerned for 
his career.

‘He said he wanted to nip it all in the bud before the school started again in September.

‘He said she was being a bit of a 
pain. He said that she was hanging around him. He said he could not 
allow this to ruin his career. I felt like I was coaching and consoling 
him because he was becoming upset.’

She said Forrest was angry that her 
daughter was doing nothing to stop the rumours, adding: ‘I offered my 
apologies for my daughter’s behaviour. He kept going over and over again
about his career.

The schoolgirl's mother told Lewes Crown Court she 'went mad' at her daughter when she confronted her about Forrest

‘He said he did not want it to get 
worse.’ She told the court she later confronted her daughter over 
Forrest’s claims. She said: ‘I went mad. I was mortified my daughter 
could put someone in this position.

‘Clearly I was upset and I had a go at her. She said it was not true. She was crying and broke down.’

The mother told the court how on the 
morning of her daughter’s disappearance she was up unusually early and 
that when she left she was ‘jumping around like a jellybean’.

The teenager returned after school to 
pick up her bag for a sleepover with a friend, her mother said, adding: 
‘She came over to me, jumped all over me. She would do that anyway.

‘This particular time she grabbed me and said “Mum, I love you”.’

Hours later the schoolgirl and Forrest took an overnight ferry from Dover to Calais, the court has heard.

Forrest denies one count of child abduction. The trial continues.
