Casey Anthony's parents reportedly have been selling children's toys and other possessions believed to belong to their dead granddaughter Caylee at a yard sale, two years after their daughter was acquitted of the two-year-old's murder in a sensational case that divided America.

Cindy and George Anthony were disposing of items including teddy bears, heart-shaped boxes and a Winnie The Pooh backpack at a house in Mount Dora, Florida on June 28, according to a witness.

The Anthonys were recognized by Florida resident Christina Werner who told Radaronline that she bought toys and children's clothing outside a home which is believed to belong to Casey Anthony's grandparents.

Ms Werner said she returned the following day to buy more children's clothing and toys from the couple and that others who were browsing the yard sale did not seem to recognize who they were.

She claimed to have chatted to the couple for two hours before purchasing items which she believes belonged to Caylee including a set of girl's travel cases and a Tigger bag.

Ms Werner told Radar: 'I simply will never understand how these grandparents can put a price tag on Caylee’s items.

'I can understand Casey’s things, but I will never understand how they could part with these things at a yard sale!'

There was no sign of their daughter Casey Anthony, who became a notorious and much-reviled figure, spending most of her time in hiding since she was acquitted of killing her daughter in July 2011.

Casey Anthony reported her two-year-old daughter Caylee Marie missing in the summer of 2008, 31 days after her daughter was last seen.

Disposal: Caylee Anthony with her mother Casey. The little girl disappeared in June 2008 and her body was found months later buried in a trash bag in Florida

Reminders: Cindy and George Anthony were reportedly selling off the toys and clothes of their dead granddaughter during a Florida yard sale last month

Following a massive manhunt, the
toddler's badly-decomposed body was found four months later buried in a trash bag in Florida woodland.

Anthony was charged with first-degree murder. At her trial in 2011, a
jury believed Anthony’s version of events that Caylee had accidentally 
drowned and she had panicked and buried the girl with her father George.

Although Anthony was found not guilty of murder in 2011, she was 
convicted of lying to police after it emerged that she had made up her 
explanation of why Caylee was missing.

She
claims to be nearly $800,000 in debt thanks to heavy legal fees, and a 
bankruptcy trustee has sought to sell off the rights to her life story 
in order to pay her bills.

Hiding: Casey Anthony, pictured in March this year, has been seen little since she was acquitted of her daughter's murder two years ago

Release: Anthony leaves jail with her lawyer Jose Baez in July 2011
