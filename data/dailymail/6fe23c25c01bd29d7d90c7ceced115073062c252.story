With spring on the way, most Aussies are getting a haircut.

But a shearing has been especially welcome for Shaun - the sheep who was found wandering the island state of Tasmania with one of the world's heaviest ever fleeces.

The gigantic sheep has now shed 23.5kg of wool, enough to make 40 jumpers and just shy of the world record set by another lost sheep ten years ago.

Before: Shaun the sheep - who was found wandering on a Tasmanian farm - has finally had a haircut, shedding 23.5kg in one of the heaviest fleeces ever sheared from a single sheep. He is pictured just before it took place 

After: Aah, that's better! Shaun appeared spindly and trembling after his haircut at the hands of Mr and Mrs Hazell - with thin legs for an animal that was previously carrying the weight of a seven-year-old child

Farmers Peter and Netty Hazell found the six-year-old ram in scrubland on Sunday and nicknamed him Shaun after the character from the TV series Wallace and Gromit.

'He couldn't see very well because of the wool over his face, so I snuck up behind him and grabbed him,' Mr Hazell told ABC News.

Shaun's tag suggests he is from a farm hundreds of kilometres away on Tasmania's east coast, meaning he has been wandering across the state for years.

'It is the heaviest sheep I've ever lifted,' said Mr Hazell's wife Netty.

'I just couldn't believe it, I just could not believe a sheep could have so much wool.'

Hard work: Shaun during his haircut in the Midlands region of Tasmania. He was almost the world's heaviest

Gigantic: Shaun earlier this week. Farmer Peter Hazell managed to pounce on him because he could not see

Also amazing was that Shaun was able to survive in the wild for so long.

'Usually they get cast and can't get up, or they get fly-struck or the hot weather gets to them,' Mr Hazell said.

Shaun's haircut today revealed a trembling, spindly animal under his mass of hair.

It must have been a shock to the animal, as his fleece has become one of the heaviest ever sheared from a single sheep.

But it does not beat the world record, which is held by a New Zealander named Shrek. 

The merino shot to international fame in 2004 after he avoided being caught and shorn for six years. Merinos are normally shorn annually, but Shrek apparently hid in caves, avoiding muster.

His fleece weighed an astonishing 27kg, and he was even taken to meet New Zealand's Prime Minister.

Monstrous: Shrek's bulk came close to beating the world record set by a New Zealand merino sheep in 2004

Celebrity: Sadly Shrek (pictured) retains the title. He was even taken to see New Zealand's Prime Minister
