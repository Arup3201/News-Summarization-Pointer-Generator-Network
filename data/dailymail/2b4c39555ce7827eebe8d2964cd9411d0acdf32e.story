Johan Mjallby felt regret and disappointment as he watched Celtic crash out of the Champions League to Maribor. Yet, by his own admission, there was no real surprise.

The former Parkhead assistant manager resigned and returned to Sweden in April amid concerns the plc board were loathe to invest large sums on new players.

After two years of delivering Champions League football, failure at the third time of asking was likely to end as most managerial reigns do. In the sack.

‘It’s important for Celtic to play and be in the Champions League,’ Mjallby told Sportsmail.

‘But I felt a few months ago that this might happen because there probably wouldn’t be much investment in the team.

‘There was a big risk for us as a management team that we wouldn’t be able to take the team to the Champions League for a third time running. And that wouldn’ t have looked too good for us.

‘Because, as well as working with the club and working with the players, you must also keep an eye on what is best for you.

‘And that’s why leaving wasn’t really the hardest decision of my life that I had to take. I definitely made the right decision.’

Like his boss Neil Lennon, Mjallby saw the Champions League exit coming and jumped before he was pushed.

The former defender is currently playing golf, spending time with the family and waiting for the phone to ring. 

By his own admission, his levels of boredom grow by the day. Yet the events of Tuesday night offered some form of vindication.

In the aftermath of defeat to a modest Maribor team, around 200 supporters gathered on the club’s shiny new Celtic Way.

‘Sack the Board’ summoned up memories of the pre-Fergus McCann era. And for Celtic, the levels of dissent are now a problem.

After successive defeats to modest Legia Warsaw and Maribor teams, there is little appetite for Europa League football.

That could change after Thursday’s draw when Celtic could be paired with one of the top seeds from a group featuring Sevilla, Lyon, Inter Milan and Tottenham. From pot three, they could be pitted against Everton, Real Sociedad, Hull City or Rapid Vienna. Amongst the lowest seeds, meanwhile, Legia Warsaw offer the prospect of a grudge match.

European nights at Parkhead are guaranteed until Christmas at least. Yet Mjallby believes the lifting strains of Zadok the Priest could have been a feature of Parkhead once more this season with more substantial reinvestment of profits last recorded at £21.3million for the six months up to December 2013.

‘The only question you can ask yourself sometimes is what you want for your club?’ Mjallby continued.

Club hero: Mjallby was a  popular player for Celtic before becoming the Bhoys' assistant manager 

‘With no disrespect to the other teams, you are banking on Celtic winning a league which is not really competitive until you get a strong Rangers back.

‘Or unless one of the other teams find a way to be really competitive with Celtic.

‘So what do you aim for then? The Champions League.

‘Because if you achieve Champions League football, you know it’s going to be full houses, you know the crowds are going to be up.

‘Right now, they are not getting full houses playing in the Scottish league like it was when I was a player there.

‘The worst crowd I ever had as a player was 56,800.

‘I know these are changed days. But that is why it is even more pivotal that you get into the Champions League.

‘Even if you spend money and get good names, it’s not a guarantee you will definitely make it into the Champions League. There is no such thing. But it gives you a better chance.

‘And at least then you show intent to the supporters that you are ready to really, really go for it.’

How much Celtic would have to spend to compete in the Champions League is the question. A £5m striker would have offered no cast-iron guarantees.

Slowly stagnating in a one-team SPFL Premiership, however, Mjallby craved an injection of quality.

Under pressure: Ronny Deila has made a poor start as Celtic manager and is feeling the heat already 

There was no prospect of a £12m deal for Shane Long or spending £11m on Ross McCormack. With the broadcasting revenues in Scotland, it was out of the question.

Defying the loss of key players such as Gary Hooper, Victor Wanyama and Kelvin Wilson to lead the team to the Champions League two years in a row, however, there was a feeling that the club’s transfer policy could be less rigid when the need arose.

‘We knew inside that there was never really a great chance the club would invest very much,’ added Mjallby. ‘In fairness, you can see why.

‘They have to look after the finances of the club and they have made quite a good job of it in the last few years.

‘But they did that with the help of us bringing Champions League football and Champions League money in. And all we wanted was to make the team stronger.

‘I think we should have had a bit more credit for what we did at Celtic. Because in four years we might have won a trophy or so more, but we did really well by taking the club to the Champions League twice.

‘That’s something we are very proud of.’

Mjallby and Lennon anticipated the sale of Fraser Forster. There was concern that Virgil van Dijk might follow suit. Comments from the Dutch defender yesterday suggest he still might.

‘We all agree in management that if you have a team and you win trophies then you want to make that team even stronger,’ said Mjallby. ‘You want to make it even better. That’s how it should be.

‘But we felt that this simply wasn’t going to happen.

‘We could see last year that we needed some reinforcements.

‘That’s not criticising the team we had because we were quite happy with the lads. But we were greedy. We wanted to take another step and make the team even stronger to make sure we could keep bringing Champions League football to the club. Both for ourselves and for the club, as well. And we just couldn’t see that happening.’

They may not have been alone in that. When Lennon followed Mjallby’s lead by resigning, Celtic approached Henrik Larsson – then Roy Keane - before settling for Ronny Deila as manager.

In the first real indication that Larsson had concerns over the budget available, Mjallby revealed: ‘Obviously I spoke to Henrik and I know that Henrik spoke to Neil as well.

‘We all played together, so that’s natural.

‘He was obviously proud that Celtic were asking him the question, but you know Henrik.

‘He is a very stubborn man and he decided to really show the Swedish public that he could stay in the top flight with a small club like Falkenberg.

‘But it was at the back of his head I think that there was no Rangers there and he might lose a wee bit of the competitive edge he was used to at Celtic.

‘And, of course, we were struggling a  bit with the board not really being ready to spend – and maybe that was in the back of his mind, as well.

‘Maybe he was thinking, “This is not the right time”. But in the future, I can definitely see Henrik being Celtic manager one day.’

In contrast with Deila, Larsson appears to have dodged a speeding bullet. The Celtic board will do well to do the same in the weeks ahead.
