Lionel Messi put his Ballon d'Or disappointment behind him by leading Barcelona to an emphatic 4-0 win at Deportivo with a hat-trick on Sunday.

His 30th career treble was his 22nd in La Liga, leaving him one behind Cristiano Ronaldo's record of 23, but perhaps more impressively, his three strikes took him to 340 goals in 340 matches for the club.

And Messi uploaded an image of himself with his Barcelona team-mates to his Instagram account shortly after the victory with the caption 'homecoming.'

Mundo Deportivo lead with the front page 'on a roll' and point out that Luis Enrique named the same team for the clash at the Riazor that beat defending champions Atletico Madrid 3-1 last weekend.

Sport describes Lionel Messi as 'colossal' after his hat-trick against Deportivo on Sunday

Sport highlights Messi's 30th hat-trick, calling him 'colossal Messi' while Marca's front page reports on Real Madrid's 3-0 win away to Getafe. 

The headline 'Benzemago' refers to Karim Benzema's sublime assist for Cristiano Ronaldo to mark his third Ballon D'or victory with two more goals for Madrid, including the opener after Benzema slalomed around two defenders on the byline before his pull back left his team-mate with a tap in.

AS also refers to 'a piece of genius' from Benzema' in Madrid's win, which maintained their one-point lead over Barcelona, and also mentions Atletico's 2-0 win against Granada.

In Italy, Corriere dello Sport leads with Juventus stretching their advantage over second-placed Roma to five points with a 4-0 win of their own, against Verona.

Tuttosport reports that 'the streets of Verona are paved with (Paul) Pogba, (Carlos) Tevez, and (Roberto) Pereyra' after goals for Juventus.

They also cover the 'Milan crisis' after Filippo Inzaghi's side succumbed to a 1-0 defeat by Atalanta at the San Siro.

It's a story that dominates Gazzetta dello Sport, with the paper saying Atalanta's win condemned 'a team without ideas to the whistles of the San Siro... and the wrath of (Silvio) Berlusconi.'
