Emmanuel Frimpong has signed for Championship side Barnsley from Arsenal for an undisclosed fee but he seems more worried about his chances of action OFF the pitch.

The injury-prone midfielder tweeted: 'How am I gonna draw girls now' - meaning he will find it difficult to attract girls - before quickly deleting his update.

Frimpong struck a more conciliatory note later, tweeting the official Barnsley account with the message: 'Hope to see all the Fans there tomoz big derby Game'.

Tweet's not sweet: Frimpong was worrying about his chances with the ladies on Twitter

Despite his off-field reservations, the 22-year-old has signed a contract at Oakwell until June 2014.

The 'female situation' Frimpong is fearing is similar to Barnsley's former Macedonian Georgi Hristov, who complained about the beauty of girls in South Yorkshire.

'I'm finding it difficult to find a girlfriend in Barnsley, or indeed settle into a decent way of life,' he said.

'The local girls are far uglier than the ones back in Belgrade or Skopje, the capital of Macedonia, where I come from.

'Our women are much prettier. Besides, they don't drink as much beer as the Barnsley girls which is something I don't like at all.'

Wasted potential: Frimpong never truly kicked on at the Gunners

Frimpong has enjoyed loan spells at Wolves, Charlton and Fulham, but never progressed under Arsene Wenger.

Indeed, he has not made an appearance this season and played just 14 times last campaign after injuring his knee.

He impressed in the youth set up, along with best pal Jack Wilshere, but lacked the required quality at his favourite side and has not played in the Premier League for Arsenal since December 2012.

In 2012, Frimpong tweeted: 'I’ll never leave Arsenal even if I’m released. I’ll beg on both knees to stay.’ Wenger must not have been in a merciful mood.
