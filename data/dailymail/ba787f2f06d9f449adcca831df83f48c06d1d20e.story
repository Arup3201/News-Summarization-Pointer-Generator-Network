Just weeks after a Brisbane stadium banned the use of selfie sticks at a One Direction concert, the promoter of a national festival has followed suite.

Branding them as narcassistic, Soundwave festival promoter AJ Maddah took to Twitter this week to express his outrage over the accessories, leading to a ban which revellers have embraced with open arms.

'Dear people with those f***ing camera sticks: please have some consideration for people behind you trying to enjoy the show. Thank you,' Maddah wrote on Sunday.

Selfie sticks have been banned at the upcoming legs of the Soundwave festival 

The festival's promoter took to Twitter last week to express his hatred for the contraptions

He has now warned fans they will have selfie sticks and tablets confiscated at the gates and put in a cloak room if they try to bring them in

After support from fans and festival goers calling for him to ban them, the promoter told his followers to 'consider it done'.

Maddah also warned patrons if they tried to bring tablets into the upcoming legs of Soundwave - which hits most Australian capital cities - they would be confiscated.

'No tablets allowed at #SW15 (Soundwave 2015)', he posted on Twitter.

In a follow up interview with Fairfax, Maddah called the selfie sticks egotistic and said they get in the way of others having a good time at concerts.

'It is just the ultimate expression of narcissism,' he told the publication.

After many fans took his side on Twitter about barring the devices he made it official

He said no one would be allowed to bring a tablet into a Soundwave festival 'ever again'

Maddah has pointed out the danger but also inconvenience they are to other festival goers

The promoter said the final straw came when he saw someone taking a photo of themselves with a selfie stick instead of the band on stage

'Most of them are pointed at the stage with kids taking photos. But I think the one that kind of put it in perspective for me was there was a band set going and a young girl pointed it at herself,' Maddah added. 

He said that was the final straw for him and said if she hadn't been a paying attendee he would have grabbed the stick off her and kicked her out.

Maddah said there was no way he would allow selfie sticks or tablets into the Sydney leg of Soundwave this weekend, and would instead confiscate them and put them in a cloak room until after the festival.

Maddah made sure to make his point clear on social media this week

Some other uses also pointed out the dangers of the selfie sticks being used as weapons

The promoter helped the ban would help fans simply go and have a good time watching the performances

The promoter said not only was he concerned about fans illegally recording bands' sets, they posed a danger and also an inconvenience for those there to see the performances. 

'It is insane that people don't have enough courtesy to care about the people around them,' Maddah said.

'Just don't bring them,' he said, after seeing too many at the Adelaide and Melbourne legs of the festival.

This comes just weeks after Suncorp Stadium banned fans from bringing their selfie sticks to One Direction concerts, much to the outrage of teenage girls across the state.

Last week in a similar move Suncorp Stadium banned One Direction fans from taking selfie sticks to the concert

The restriction was listed under Suncorp Stadium's One Direction Frequently Asked Questions section.

'For the safety and comfort of other patrons, selfie sticks are not permitted into the stadium for this event,' the stadium's website said.

Other restricted items included alcohol, pepper spray or mace, fireworks, studded jewellery, spurs and unusually long wallet chains.
