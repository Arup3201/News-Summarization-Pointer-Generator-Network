Prime Minister Tony Abbott touched down in China’s capital on Sunday night ahead of a series of political meetings with various world leaders on economics, security and the MH17 disaster.

Although primarily heading to Beijing for the APEC summit, Mr Abbott is expected to hold a formal meeting with Russian president Vladimir Putin who is also in Beijing for the regional meeting.

In amongst discussion of tariff cuts and free-trade agreements with APEC leaders, as well as a meeting regarding the war in the Middle East with United States president Barack Obama according to SBS, the Prime Minister plans to discuss the MH17 disaster and fallout with Mr Putin on Tuesday.

'Australians turned (to us) with an official request for a meeting during an APEC summit and we are agreeing to such a meeting in China,' Putin's top foreign policy adviser Yury Ushakov said.

'It will be short,' he added. 

Russian backed separatists shot down the plane over east Ukraine on July 17, killing all 298 people aboard including 38 Australians. 

Mr Abbott has flagged a 'robust conversation' and wants Mr Putin to guarantee he's doing everything possible to help investigations.

'The conversation will be, as I have said, about our absolute expectation that Russia will be as good as its word, that it will fully cooperate with the investigations that are under way and that it will do what it can to ensure that justice is done,' Mr Abbott said on Saturday. 

'This is not an issue which Russia now expects to be forgotten, that this is not an atrocity which Russia thinks can be swept under the carpet'. 

The Prime Minister grabbed global headlines after threatening to 'shirtfront' the Russian president but has since toned down his language.

Instead, he insisted he would hold robust talks with the Russian president over the country's actions.

The Russian leader is also in the Chinese capital to attend the Asia-Pacific Economic Cooperation (APEC) Summit leaders' meeting

After consulting with other G20 members, Mr Abbott confirmed Mr Putin would not be banned from the economic leaders' summit next week.

Mr Abbott said as the G20 is an international organisation which works on consensus, Australia does not have the right to bar any member from attending.

Opposition Leader Bill Shorten said the shirtfront comment went too far.

'In some ways that weakened our legitimate outrage,' he told ABC TV on Sunday.

He hopes Mr Abbott uses the meeting as an opportunity to get to the bottom of what happened.

'Putin's not going to tell us the truth,' he said.

'But Tony Abbott has to at least ask.'

Australia should be lobbying for peace in Ukraine, as a silver lining to the 'senseless barbarity', Mr Shorten said.

Recovery and investigative work at the crash site has been halted because of fighting between the government and pro-Russian separatists, despite a September ceasefire.

The APEC summit, which begins on Monday and will focus on economic cooperation, marks the beginning of a whirlwind week of diplomacy for Mr Abbott, who will also visit Myanmar for Asian security talks before returning to Australia to host the G20 in Brisbane.
