Wayne Rooney has joked that English is now a secondary language in the Manchester United dressing room, with everyone now speaking Spanish.

The plethora of foreign imports coming into Old Trafford this summer, including the likes of Angel di Maria, Radamel Falcao and Ander Herrera, as well as the ones already at the club such as Juan Mata and David de Gea, has meant Spanish has now taken over as the primary language used at the club.

Rooney told Sky Sports: 'You get in the dressing room and everyone's speaking Spanish! English is getting pushed aside a bit.

'All the senior players are helping the new lads settle in too and there's a lot of foreign players so they can help each other too.

'The manager makes sure the players are speaking English as well and the club make sure things are put in place for them to adapt to life in England.'

The Manchester United and England captain also believes the emphatic victory against QPR last weekend has got the Red Devils back on the right track, with restored belief within the squad they can challenge up towards the top of the league season and bring the glory days back to Old Trafford.

'The victory against QPR has settled everyone down. We're still adapting to the changes but there's a good feeling around the training ground.

'It's different (at Manchester United now from previous years) in terms of the changes which have been implemented in the squad since Sir Alex stepped down as manager.

'This is especially the case in terms of the players that have come in and left the club at the same time, so we are all adpting to it at the moment and hopefully we can be successful.'

Rooney also said he would be disappointed in himself if he failed to break the goalscoring records for both club and country, with the 28-year-old now in sight of both records - both set by United legend Sir Bobby Charlton. 

Charlton leads the all-time records for United and England with 49 and 249 respectively, with Rooney having netted 218 times for the Red Devils and 41 for the Three Lions.

He added: 'I feel I should get both goalscoring records for England and Manchester United with the age I am now and how close I am to breaking the records. 

'I feel as though I've got a lot of football left in me at the top level so I'd be disappointed if I didn't break both of them.'
