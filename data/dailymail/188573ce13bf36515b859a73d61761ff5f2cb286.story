New laws to force internet firms such as Google to take fresh action to crack down on child pornography will be introduced by David Cameron unless they beef up anti-porn controls.

The Prime Minister will tomorrow call on online search giants and internet service providers to take drastic action to ‘obliterate’ child porn from the web.

He will demand:

Concern: Today David Cameron appeared on BBC1's Andrew Marr Show and said 'I am concerned as a politician and a parent' about child porn on the web

Demands: In a speech in London tomorrow, Mr Cameron will tell the internet firms to develop the plans by the autumn or face new laws forcing them to do as he says

In a speech in London tomorrow, Mr Cameron will tell the internet firms to develop the plans by the autumn or face new laws forcing them to do as he says.

He will say: ‘I have a very clear message for Google, Bing, Yahoo and the rest. You have a duty to act on this and it is a moral duty.

‘If the progress is slow or non-existent, I can tell you we are already looking at the legislative options we have to force action.’

Mr Cameron's initiative follows a meeting at Downing Street last week with the parents of Tia Sharp and April Jones.

Warnings: From this month, anyone logging on to a child abuse site will receive a message that the images have been taken down

The parents of murdered schoolgirls Tia Sharp and April Jones met with David Cameron to plead for him to tighten controls on child abuse images online.

Mark Bridger, was found guilty of abducting and murdering five-year-old April Jones in Powys last October.

Bridger will spend his whole life in prison after he was found guilty of killing April in a sexually motivated attack.

Sitting next to her mother Coral, April's father Paul Jones said: 'Everyone knows the Tia and April stories. What we are trying to do is stop it being another child. We never want another family sitting here having suffered the same thing,' reported The Sun.

Stuart Hazell, admitted murdering 12-year-old Tia Sharp in August 2012.

Hazell, 37, who was jailed for a minimum of 38 years in May, had sexually assaulted and murdered Tia when she stayed the night at the house.

Her mother Natalie, who attended with her partner, told Mr Cameron during the 30-minute meeting at No. 10: 'It’s a triangle — the people uploading, the people letting them upload and the people looking for it. We need to knock the first, second and third parts of this triangle down like bowling pins.'

The Prime Minster told the couples he had changed the locks on his iPad after he walked in on his daughter watching a video of how to make a bath bomb.

'I came down and she was watching a YouTube video which luckily was someone making a bath bomb. It could have been something completely different.''

The Prime Minister told BBC1's Andrew Marr Show he was prepared to bring in new laws if necessary.

He said: 'I'm concerned as a 
politician and as a parent about this issue, and I think all of us have 
been a bit guilty of saying: well it's the internet, it's lawless, 
there's nothing you can do about it.

'And that's wrong. I mean just because it's the internet doesn't mean there shouldn't be laws and rules, and also responsible behaviour.'

He welcomed the steps already being 
taken by internet firms, but added: 'There is this problem ... that some
 people are putting simply appalling terms into the internet in order to
 find illegal images of child abuse.

'And, remember, every one of these 
pictures is a crime scene and they're getting results. I think it's 
wrong that they should get results and we need to have very, very strong
 conversations with those companies about saying no, you shouldn't 
provide results for some terms that are so depraved and disgusting, I 
can't even say them on your show.

'And that, I think, there's going to 
be a big argument there, and if we don't get what we need we'll have to 
look at legislation.'

He added: 'Look, I believe in free 
speech, but free speech doesn't mean you have the right to incite 
murder, it doesn't mean you have the right to incite child abuse.

'So it's about companies wanting to act responsibly. If you think about it, there's really a triangle here.

There are the people uploading the 
images. We've got to go after them. There are the people looking at the 
images. We've got to go after them. But there is also in this triangle 
the companies that are enabling it to happen, and they do need to do 
more to help us with this.'

The warning follows an 
anti-internet porn summit in Whitehall last month which agreed to give 
the Internet Watch Foundation new powers to seek out and block offensive
 material.

In his speech, 
Mr Cameron will hail the fact that from this month, anyone trying to log
 on to a child abuse site will receive a warning that the site contained
 illegal images and has been taken down

He will say: ‘This is a vital step  forward but we need to go further. These warning pages should also tell those who’ve landed on it that they face consequences, such as losing their job, their family, even access to their children if they continue.’

Zero tolerance: David Cameron says that search engine firms should introduce a blacklist of disgusting searches which should produce no results

Mr Cameron also says that search 
engine firms should introduce a  ‘blacklist’ of disgusting searches 
which should produce no result.

He
 will add: ‘There are some searches which are so abhorrent – and where 
there can be no doubt whatsoever about the sick and malevolent intent  
of the searcher – that there should be no search results at all.’

The Prime Minister warns the internet giants not to use technical problems as an excuse for inaction.

He will say: ‘Set your greatest 
brains to work on this. You are not separate from our society, you are 
part of our society and you must play a responsible role in it.

‘This is quite simply about obliterating this disgusting material from the net – and we will do whatever  it takes.’

Last
 night, a Google spokesman said: ‘We have a zero-tolerance attitude to 
child sexual abuse imagery. Whenever we discover it, we respond quickly 
to remove and report it.

‘We
 recently donated $5 million to help combat this problem and are 
committed to continuing the dialogue with the Government on these 
issues.’

A complete ban on the most ‘abhorrent’ searches so that the search engines produce no result for those phrases.
