Fashionistas with a conscience can now make an eco-statement with their jewels by buying a precious ring made from Beijing's densely polluted air.

Scientists will suck dirty air from China's capital city with a revolutionary machine and 
compress it for around half a day to make the 'smog stones'. 

Jewellers will then set the stone within a band made from a high-quality locally sourced metal to make the smog ring. Profits will go towards micro-financing the city's first smog-free parks.

Each ring is made from - and in turn removes from the atmosphere - 1 cubic kilometre of polluted air.

The rings are the first phase in the SMOG Project, the brainchild of artist 
and innovator Daan Roosegaarde.

The Dutch designer, 35, is currently in Beijing having 
talks with the mayor, urban planning and city executives 
to iron out fine details.

Together with the city's governing bodies, Roosegaarde hopes to realise the first of many smog-free parks in Beijing.

One million rings will
 go on sale at the end of the year in various outlets worldwide for a 
cost of around £8-£80.

Early prototypes show a clear stone with the black dust particles 
embedded in the centre, though the ring is still in the design process.

Another prototype shows a chunkier version of the ring and in three different sizes

'I always try to make things which improve life,' Roosegaarde tells MailOnline.

'I
 want to show that people they can be 
part of the solution.'

'The rings may not be the solution but they can bridge the gap between where we are now and where we need to be.'

Roosegaarde's background is rooted in creating social designs that explore the relation between people, technology and space.

Right now, he and his team of experts are in the process of developing a safe, energy-friendly installation - the world's largest - to capture the smog and create
 clean air.

It will use patented ion technology and a nano air purifier to create the cleanest, smog-free space in Beijing.

A four-meter vacuum tower will use ionic filters to charge and remove smog particles, blowing fresh air out

Continued press interest has inspired large numbers of students, 
artists, designers and engineers to come forward with ideas on smog 
reduction.

Roosegaarde will collect 100-150 of these initiatives for the second phase in The SMOG Project.

He
 will use them to populate an exhibition in Beijing, showing
 'what is possible when we co-create our environment'. The show is planned for October 2015.

The third stage of the project will be the opening of the park in late 2015.

A 4m vacuum tower will sit in the centre of the park, explains the New York Times.

Ionic
 filters charge and remove smog particles, blowing fresh air out of the 
tower’s side vents.

This creates a high-pressure zone, which 
Roosegaarde’s main technical partner estimates can create a bubble that 
consistently has 75 percent less smog than elsewhere.

The aim is to build a number of smog-free parks in Beijing that harvest smog particles from the environment.

The Beijing government recently launched a £133.5m project to have its city smog free before 2017, and projects like these are leading the way.

The idea is to fund the creation of Beijing's first 40x40m smog-free park, one of many
