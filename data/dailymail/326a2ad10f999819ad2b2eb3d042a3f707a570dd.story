A man who was caught on CCTV launching an unprovoked attack on a teenage girl today admitted carrying out an almost identical assault 12 months earlier.

Michael Ayoade has previously pleaded guilty to knocking 16-year-old Tasneem Kabir unconscious in East London in November last year.

And today he confessed to hitting student Daniella Montieth in the head as she was talking on the phone at a Tube station in November 2011.

Assault: Michael Ayoade, pictured in CCTV footage, has been convicted of two separate attacks on women

The 34-year-old pleaded guilty to assault causing actual bodily harm during a hearing at Snaresbrook Crown Court.

The court heard that Ms Montieth was having problems with the ticket machine at Plaistow Underground station in East London at the time of the attack on November 20.

She was taken unawares by Ayoade, but surveillance footage showed him smacking the right side of her head.

The scar-faced defendant appeared via video link at the hearing wearing a red sweater and red trousers.

The judge ordered him to be remanded in custody ahead of a sentencing hearing for both attacks to be held on February 25 at Inner London Crown Court.

A third charge, relating to another alleged attack on a woman at Plaistow station last year, was dropped.

Three months ago, Ayoade pleaded guilty to assault after being filmed on CCTV punching Miss Kabir as she was on her way to school.

Brutal: The sudden blow left the teenager - who fell face first onto the concrete - unconscious

The footage showed him jogging up behind the girl and hitting her in the head before running off again.

Miss Kabir fell to the pavement face-first and was left unconscious on the ground with three broken teeth as well as multiple facial injuries.

Ayoade later claimed that the schoolgirl had 'started it' and had 'made me feel like a pauper with her facial gestures'.

He said he had attacked her because he could not stand 'taking an insult from a little person like that'.
