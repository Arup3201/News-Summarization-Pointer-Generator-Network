Jailed: Paige Bain, 16, was sentenced to two years and eight months for her part in the racist attack in which a pregnant woman was punched and a Sudanese woman had her hijab pulled off

A teenage thug has been jailed for her part in a racist attack in which a Sudanese woman had her hijab headscarf pulled off.

Paige Bain, 16, also repeatedly punched a five-months pregnant woman during the assault, which was carried out with her aunt, Eileen Kennedy, 28.

Umaimi Musa, from Darfur, Sudan, and her Congolese friend Mary Marandran were sitting in a playpark in Royston, Glasgow, in September last year when they heard foul-mouthed racist insults being hurled at them. They were then set upon.

The incident was captured on CCTV and the camera operator raised the alarm with police as the attack happened.

Yesterday, Sheriff Kenneth Mitchell sentenced Bain to two years and eight months in prison for the attack.

Kennedy was earlier jailed for two years and six days for her part in the assault. The then 15-year-old and Kennedy, pleaded guilty at an earlier hearing at Glasgow Sheriff Court to racially assaulting 41-year-old Miss Musa to her injury.

Kennedy also admitted resisting arrest and claiming she had an infection before spitting on a police officer.

Bain admitted racially aggravated assault on Mrs Marandran, 40.

Procurator fiscal depute Mark Allan, prosecuting, said: ‘Bain, repeatedly punched the then pregnant Mrs Marandran on her head and pushed her.’

He told the court that both accused demanded Miss Musa’s mobile phone and tried to grab it off her after she told them she was going to call the police.

Mr Allan said Miss Musa was punched on the head and fell to the ground.

He added: ‘Once on the ground, she was repeatedly punched on her head and body.

‘Her hijab or headscarf – as she can be seen wearing during the course of this incident – was pulled from her head, and she was robbed of her mobile telephone.

Guilty: The pair pleaded guilty at an earlier hearing at Glasgow Sheriff Court to racially assaulting 41-year-old Miss Musa to her injury

‘Police officers were directed to the scene by those operating the CCTV.’

Both Mrs Marandran and Miss Musa were taken to Glasgow’s Royal Infirmary for treatment.

Miss Musa was found to have a bruised cheek, a grazed knee and a sore neck.

Mrs Marandran’s unborn baby suffered no ill-effects.
