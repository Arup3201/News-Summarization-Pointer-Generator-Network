Want to upgrade to the new iPad but can't afford it? Wal-Mart wants to help.

The nation's largest retailer has announced that customers can trade-in their old devices for up to $300 and that cash can go towards the thinner, lighter iPad Air.

The news comes just a day after Apple launched the impressive new tablet.

At any of Wal-Mart's 3,600 stores nationwide, shoppers can get up to $300 for their current iPad, depending on the model, from today.

Wal-Mart will start carrying the new iPad Air on Friday, which it will sell for $479. The new iPad mini will retail for $399 once Apple makes it available.

The trade-in plan echoes the program Wal-Mart introduced last month for smartphones, soon after Apple unveiled the IPhone 5s and 5c models.

But Wal-Mart isn't the only retailer offering it.

Others also see it as a way to attract customers who want the latest models of devices they already own, but now consider obsolete.

Wal-Mart also revealed that it is slashing prices on older iPad models effective immediately, with the 16 GB iPad with Retina Wi-Fi now $449 from $499 and the 16GB iPad mini Wi-Fi now $299 from $329.

Apple's unveiling on Tuesday added serious fuel to the fire in the battle of the tablets in the run up to Christmas and came just hours after Nokia entered the tablet market with its Lumia 2520 and Microsoft started selling its new Surface devices.

The iPad Air is thinner, lighter, more powerful than ever before, Apple said.

Launch: Philip W. Schiller, senior vice president of worldwide marketing, unveiled the newly named iPad Air Tuesday. It features a new design that's reminiscent of the iPad mini released last year

New version: Apple's new iPad Air, right, is the fifth 9.7-inch model to be sold by the Californian-firm. It is 43 per cent thinner than the previous model and has a 5MP camera. The new iPad Mini, left, has a 7.9-inch Retina display and 10 hours battery life

It has 9.7-inch Retina display with a smaller bezel and is 43 per cent thinner than the previous model, making it more comfortable to hold. It also has a 5MP camera and dual microphones for the first time.

Apple announced that the device will come in four colors - silver, white, 'space grey' and black.

The tablet is 7.5mm thick and weighs just 1lb, compared to the 1.4lb previous model, making it the 'lightest full size tablet in the world'.

The tablet also has Apple's A7 chip, that was just launched in the iPhone 5S and is twice as fast as before.The graphics are 72 per cent faster than the very first iPad.

It's almost a year to to the 
day since Apple's CEO Tim Cook unveiled Apple's first generation iPad mini.Â

Speaking to the crowd at San Francisco's Yuerba Buena Center for the Arts, he said: 'You're going to see some amazing products this morning.'

Apple also unveiled a new iPad Mini with a new high resolution 7.9inch Retina display, which also has the new A7 chip from the iPhone 5s.

It boasts 10 hours of battery life, improved wi-fi and better LTE support, and is available in silver, white, space grey and black, contrary to rumors that suggested it would come in a rainbow of colors like the iPhone C.

The original iPad mini, which previously cost $329, will now cost $299 - 'the lowest price for an iPad yet.'

However, neither new iPad comes with Apple's Touch ID fingerprint sensor.

Tim Cook said the latest iPad is Apple's 'most advanced technology in a revolutionary and magical device.

He
said: 'Now everybody seems to be making a tablet, even some of the 
doubters but iPad is used more than any of the rest. iPad is used over FOUR 
times more than all of those other tablets put together.'
