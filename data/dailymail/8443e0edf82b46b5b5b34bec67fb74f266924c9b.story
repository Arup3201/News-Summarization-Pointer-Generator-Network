Miss Alabama has been forced to change her telephone number after receiving 'thousands' of calls following her now-famous appearance in the stands at the BCS Championship game on Monday.

And amid the swelling attention, Katherine Webb has cancelled eight interviews for Thursday, fearful that her new-found fame will spell bad news for her relationship with Alabama quarterback, A.J. McCarron, whom she has been dating for a month.

Miss Webb, 23, shot to fame after ESPN's cameras panned to her in the first quarter of the game on Monday night, sparking fawning comments from sportscasters Kirk Herbstreit and Brent Musburger.

Focus: Miss Alabama Katherine Webb has cancelled interviews so that her relationship with Alabama quarterback A.J. McCarron is viewed as sincere, rather than as a celebrity stunt

Ever since, her phone has been ringing off the hook, Donald Trump, who co-owns the Miss Universe Organization, told Page Six.

'She was forced to change her phone number,' Trump said. 'She was getting thousands and thousands of calls. Katherine has to stay grounded now that she's become a big star.'

Webb also told TMZ that she has cancelled interviews scheduled for today because she is concerned her relationship with McCarron will simply be seen as a 'celebrity status' thing.

'I want it to be about me and him,' she said. 'He's a guy I can see myself having a real future with.'

Who's that girl? Miss Webb, quickly became an internet sensation after appearing on camera on Monday

cameras picked her out in the crowd during the game on Monday night

She insisted that McCarron had not asked her to cancel the interviews, after TMZ had earlier reported that he was upset about being overshadowed by his girlfriend.

The website had reported that the quarterback was unhappy that media outlets were ignoring his spectacular win over Notre Dame on Monday, and giving coverage to her instead.

But other sources said the sports star just wanted to keep his private life out of the public eye, and wants his team's accomplishments to be recognised instead.

Webb became an internet hit after her appearance at the Miami stadium.

'I'm telling you, you quarterbacks, you 
get all the good looking women,' 73-year-old commentator Brent Musburger gushed as the camera stayed on Webb. 
'What a beautiful woman.'

Speaking out: Miss Webb appeared on the Today show on Wednesday to stick up for the commentators but she has now cancelled other interviews for Thursday

'Wow!' former Ohio State quarterback Kirk Herbstreit added. 'AJ's doing some things right down in Tuscaloosa.'

'If
you're a youngster in Alabama, start getting the football out and throw
it around the backyard with pop,' added Musburger, who has been married
to his wife Arlene for 50 years.

With some media commentators and viewers branding their comments 'creepy', ESPN was forced to apologize on Tuesday.

'We
always try to capture interesting
storylines, and the relationship between an Auburn grad who is Miss 
Alabama USA and the current Alabama quarterback certainly met that test.
However, we apologize that the commentary in this instance went too far
and Brent understands that.'

But the reigning Miss Alabama simply said she was 'flattered' by their remarks.

Support: Webb and McCarron both laughed off the attention, and the QB added: 'I'm the one who's blessed'

'If he had said something along the 
lines of we were hot or sexy or any derogatory statements like that, 
that would have been a bit different,' she told the Today show on Wednesday morning.

'The fact that he said we were beautiful and gorgeous - I don't see why any woman wouldn't be flattered by that.'

But as well as Miss Webb herself, her father, Alan Webb, came to the defense of Musburger.

'On
one hand, you can look at it as being kind of like the dirty old man,' 
he said. 'But I'm used to this and I think if you really look into what 
that he was trying to say, he was trying to be complimentary, and I 
think they need to give Brent a break.'

Fan: Miss Universe co-owner Donald Trump offered for Miss Webb to become a judge at Miss USA

Fan favourite: The 23-year-old is an Alabama native and graduated from Auburn University

Within minutes of ESPN broadcasting her image, Miss Webb became an internet sensation and saw her Twitter followers soar from around 2,300 to more than 205,000 by Tuesday evening.

Donald Trump took to Twitter to say he would be offering Webb a place as a judge at the next Miss USA Pageant.

'We are proud of her,' he added. 'What a great couple... Katherine Webb and AJ McCarron. They are both winners.'

Webb
was in shock about the reaction, revealing that her phone was 
drained of battery thanks to an influx of new followers, texts and 
calls, but to McCarron, the attention came as no surprise.

'I know she's good looking,' McCarron 
said. 'She's gonna have guys that jaw-drop over her. That's life. I 
guess I'm the blessed one at the end of the day. She's gotta put up with
me.'

Winner: McCarron holds The Coaches' Trophy after the BCS National Championship college football game against Notre Dame on Monday night. Alabama won the title 42-14

Star player: McCarron threw four touchdown passes and finished with 264 yards through the air

Webb, who grew up in Montgomery, Alabama and graduated from Auburn, finished in the top ten in the Miss USA competition in June and lives and works as a model in Los Angeles.

McCarron and Webb met over Twitter 
when a friend connected them in November, and in December, the sportsman
went to the pageant for Miss Alabama USA 2013, where Webb ended her 
reign.

The pair have been together since and grinned for photographs together on Christmas Eve.

Alabama beat Notre Dame 42-14 on Monday to win their third college football title in four years.

McCarron threw four touchdown passes 
and finished with 264 yards through the air, while running back Eddie 
Lacy and receiver Amari Cooper had two scores each.
