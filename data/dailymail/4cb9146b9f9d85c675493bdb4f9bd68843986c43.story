Ben Panangian, who has been romantically linked to convicted Australian drug smuggler Schapelle Corby, has been jailed for 10 months for using marijuana.

Ben Panangian, who claims he and Corby are 'just friends', was sentenced in Bali after being found with two packages of the drug.

The stand-up paddleboard instructor escaped the more serious charged of drug possession which carries a 12- year jail term.

Judge Beslin ruled Panangian is 'an active drug user, especially of marijuana,' News.com.au reported.

Ben Panangian appeared in Bali's Denpasar District Court on Thursday to be sentenced

He was found with 0.64 grams of the drug when arrested on August 20 and another package of 6.58 grams was found in his wardrobe.

Panangian admitted using marijuana since the age of 14 and smoking it on Kuta Beach.

Judge Breslin said: 'The defendant is still young so the defendant can change his behaviour in the future. The defendant is a victim of his behaviour and victim of narcotic circulation.'

In November, when appearing at Denpasar District Court, one of the judges on the panel questioned Panangian twice about his relationship status with Corby.

Panagian was adamant that the infamous Australian is just a friend.

'Friend or friend?' the judge asked.

'I know her just as a friend,' Panangian said.

However, shortly after his arrest in August, Daily Mail Australia visited his home in South Kuta where the landlord at Panangian's rented apartment said Corby visited Panangian in the morning and afternoons at his house about two to three times a week.

‘She comes in the afternoon and leaves by the evening,’ landlord Myoman Yasa said.

Daily Mail Australia showed the neighbour and landlord recent photos of Corby and they confirmed that she was ‘definitely’ the woman they had seen visiting the house.

One of Corby's parole conditions states that she must not be involved with crime or drugs.

She was released on parole on 10 February 2014 after serving nine years in prison but cannot leave Indonesia until July 2017.

Corby and Panangian were linked as early as 2006 after meeting in Bali's Kerobokan Prison.

She was serving nine years in jail for couriering 4.2 kilograms of marijuana to Indonesia in her boogie board bag in 2004.

She was stopped by officers at Ngurah Rai International Airport in Denpasar and was sentenced 20 years behind bars in 2005.

She was later granted a five-year sentence reduction.

Panangian was also previously locked up for drug charges.
