Cruel deception: Emma La Garde, 38, whose face is pixellated to protect her son's anonymity, wrote to him from prison saying she misses him and blaming lies on her being 'poorly'

A mother who pretended her son had cancer to claim thousands of pounds of benefits has written to him from prison saying she misses him.

Emma La Garde, 38, made her seven-year-old use a wheelchair and shaved his head and eyebrows to mimic the effects of chemotherapy in a scam that made her £86,000.

Jailed last November for three years and four months, she has now written to her son explaining that she tricked him and the authorities because she was 'poorly', and saying she would like to see him again.

La Garde, who was divorced by the boy's father after he was also taken in by her lies, sent the boy, now aged 11, a two-page letter from Holloway Prison in north London begging for forgiveness.

She wrote: 'When mummy was poorly I didn’t do a good job of being a mummy to you and I want to be better so you can be proud of me being your mum again, even grown-ups make mistakes you see.'

She told her son, who insists he doesn't want to see her, that she looked forward to seeing him again, and insisted that her cruel deception of him didn't mean she didn't love him.

'I still look out of the window every night and say goodnight to you all and I love you and no matter how far apart we are you are always with me in my heart and I’ll never stop loving or caring about you,' she wrote.

La Garde, who tricked not only her 
family but also the child's school, health authority and the Department 
of Work and Pensions (DWP), asked her son to write to her telling her what he 
was up to, and said she missed him.

She suggested he might like to do a 
drawing or painting for her, and said she was studying new courses in 
prison to help her get a job when she is released next year.

La Garde told her son, who is now living with his brother and siblings at a secret location, that she and her boyfriend plan to move away from the area when she is released because she thought he wouldn't like to bump into her at the supermarket.

She said she planned to see him somewhere where he could have fun, rather than in a family contact centre.

The boy, who cannot be named for legal reasons, told the Mirror he had no intention of seeing his mother at the moment as he was happy living with his father, with whom he enjoyed watching films and eating enchiladas.

La Garde, who forged doctors' notes and shaved her son's head, is from Stroud, Gloucestershire (file picture)

He said: 'I wouldn’t mind seeing her when I’m a bit older and asking her some stuff – about why she did it.'

Now doing well at school, he said he didn't miss his mother, who he said used to give her children ready meals from Tesco, and had not seen her since she was jailed.

His childhood was blighted by his mother who began her elaborate deception in 2008 when she took the child, then six, to the doctor when he complained of pains in his legs.

Tests found nothing wrong beyond enlarged tonsils, and the GP wrote to the boy's parents giving him the all-clear, but La Garde copied the surgery's template and forged a letter saying he was seriously ill.

Initially she said he had ALPS (autoimmune lymphoproliferative syndrome) causing an enlarged spleen, and notified both his school and the DWP, to claim Disability Living Allowance (DLA).

La Garde is now at HMP Holloway, in north London, and told her son she enjoys spending time in the gardens

In 2009 she sent her son to school in a wheelchair donated by the Red Cross and told them he could not do PE, and the following year she sent the school another forged doctor's letter saying her son had lymphoma, a type of cancer, and would have treatment that would make his hair fall out.

She then shaved the child's head and eyebrows and made him wear a bandana to school.

La Garde told her husband the boy had cancer and doctors said he did not have long to live, before sitting her son down and told him, too.

They told their family and friends, and La Garde announced the news on her Facebook page.

The child was not allowed to sit on the floor during school assembly and had to sit at the back with teachers, and when La Garde used some of his DLA to take them to Disney World in Florida, she made him stay in his wheelchair and used a disability pass to jump the queues.

Meanwhile at home the son, who was perfectly healthy, enjoyed bouncing on his trampoline.

The judge at Gloucester Crown Court, pictured, told La Garde her behaviour was 'quite beyond the pale' and jailed her for three years and four months

La Garde was eventually caught when the boy's father, who had lived with her for 12 years, went to discuss him with the school and saw a forged letter with the word 'to' spelled as 'too' - a mistake he knew La Garde always made.

He marched to the GP who confirmed that the boy was not ill, and blew the whistle.  He left her when she was arrested in 2010 and divorced her last year.

Now 38, the boy's father says her letter, which was sent on May 25 this year, shows she has not changed and is still refusing to acknowledge her fault.

Investigators believe La Garde's scam made her more than £100,000, but the official figure was reduced to £85,898 on a technicality.

She admitted child cruelty, fraud and forgery and lost custody of her two children from a first marriage and three from the second.

The court heard that she was not mentally ill and had used the proceeds of her crime to fund a comfortable lifestyle with four-bedroom detached house, smart new car, and luxury holidays.
