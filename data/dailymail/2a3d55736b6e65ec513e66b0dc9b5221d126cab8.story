Adverts aimed at under-12s could be banned under new laws to prevent the commercialisation of childhood being considered by the Labour party.

Raunchy pop videos which ‘degrade’ women and access to porn for children could also be targeted under Swedish-style reforms examined by Jon Cruddas .

Ed Miliband’s policy chief promised more support for new dads, including paid time off to attend ante-natal classes and allowing them to stay overnight in hospital after their partner gives birth.

Britain could follow Sweden in banning adverts aimed at under-12s under new laws being studied by the Labour party

In a speech on family policy, Mr Cruddas said the economic crash had heaped pressure on mothers and fathers.

‘Too often that has meant women dropping out of the labour market, and men unable to spend time with their children.’

He warned the majority of men ‘feel fathers are undervalued’ and struggle to cope with parenting in the 21st century.

New dads feel 'less informed than their partners and less competent to care for their baby', Mr Cruddas warned.

Jon Cruddas, Ed Miliband's policy chief, said too many fathers feel under-valued

He added: ‘Parents do not want advertisers targeting children, or pop videos depicting degrading images of women.

‘And they don’t want their children accessing pornography on the internet.

‘The commercialisation of childhood creates a status seeking consumer culture in which children judge one another by what they own.’

Labour is to examine how to ‘empower parents to decide what content their children see online’.

The policy review will include studying family laws in Sweden, which has banned advertising to children under 12, Mr Cruddas said.

More also needs to be done to include fathers in bringing up their children, even before birth.

Dads would get new rights written into law, if Labour wins the next election.

Mr Cruddas said: ‘More and more men want to be involved fathers. Fathers should be able to share involvement in their child’s school life and healthcare.

‘They should have rights enshrined in employment law; for example, we will look at paid leave to attend antenatal sessions and hospital appointments during pregnancy.’

Many public services think involving fathers is ‘not important’, viewing all fathers as a posing a ‘risk’ of ‘violence against women’.

Mr Cruddas added: ‘We need a “whole family” approach which assumes, where it is safe, that a child needs a relationship with both parents.

‘Being a good father is about more than earning a living for the family.

‘Men want fulfilling home lives and women want fulfilling working lives but policy still pushes mothers into the home and fathers into work. The majority of men feel fathers are undervalued.

‘They work the longest hours in Europe and yet 82 per cent say they want to spend more time with their children.

‘Fathers are good for children and shared parenting is good for mothers.’

More support is also needed for mothers to cope with the aftermath of childbirth, he said.

'The era of thinking that we have done our job caring for mothers once they are through the physical experience of childbirth is long gone.'
