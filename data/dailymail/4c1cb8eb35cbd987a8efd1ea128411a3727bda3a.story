What happens in Vegas, stays in Vegas .. or does it?

Couples in London have been spontaneously saying 'I do' thanks to a pop-up wedding venue.

The wedding 'chapel', complete with an Elvis Presley on hand to preside over 'nuptials', has popped-up in Shoreditch, East London and is a hit amongst those looking for a quick, easy and inexpensive wedding.

The pop-up Little White Chapel has landed in London and it already packed out

Mylin and Don Richard were on their way home armed with a Thai take-away when they spotted the chapel.

'We thought we should be spontaenous and it looked like fun, we were already engaged so thought why not,' said Mylin.

Mylin and Don Richard felt like doing something spontaneous so got hitched on the way home from getting a take-away

Mylin, a finance worker who had come straight from the office said: 'I wasn't as dressed up as I wanted to be, I wish I'd had more make-up on but it was good fun. I haven't told me parents yet.'

The couple, who are having an 
official wedding ceremony in Hawaii in 2014, went straight home after 
tying the knot and reheated and ate their take-away.

For
more organised couples keen to take their relationship to the next 
level, they can book a 20-minute slot using a new app on their 
smartphone.

'One man had downloaded the app and booked a slot without
his partners knowledge. They turned up and he had bought some flowers 
and a bag of haribo sweets, the ones with the rings.

'She was also 
pregnant with their first child and he wants to be married before the 
child arrives,' an event organiser told MailOnline.

The chapel was launched 
following research by YPlan, a new going out app, which revealed 80 per 
cent of Brits would be willing to marry someone they'd only just met.

The
poll also placed London at just number six in the rankings of the 
world's most spontaneous cities, behind Rio, Paris and Las Vegas.

YPlan's founder Rytis Vitkauskassays: 'The YPlan app gives Londoners the chance to be more spontaneous, with tickets to up to 10 of the coolest events in London that night in just two taps.Â 

'What better way to celebrate its launch than by bringing a taste of the world's most spontaneous city to the City?'

The chapel comes complete with an Elvis Presley to help you tie the knot

The chapel will run from 6pm - 11pm from 5th - 9th December at Boxpark in Shoreditch.
