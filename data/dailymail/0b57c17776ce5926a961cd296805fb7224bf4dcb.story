One-third of phone users would definitely upgrade to a Facebook phone  - and 73% think the phone is a ‘good idea’.

News of the phone emerged this week, with sources claiming that Facebook had hired ex-Apple engineers to work on an ‘official’ Facebook phone.

Facebook  has made several ventures into the mobile market before in partnership with manufacturers such as HTC and INQ - but a new phone made by ex-Apple engineers is rumoured to be in production

It’s not the first Facebook phone to hit 
the market – the social network giant has previously partnered with INQ 
and HTC to produce Facebook-oriented handsets, including phones with a  
built-in ‘Like’ button.

Details of the proposed phone are scant, but Facebook is already making moves into the mobile space with a series of high-profile app acquisitions.

After its $1 billion purchase of Instagram, the social network bought location-based social app Glancee and photo-sharing app Lightbox.

Facebook’s smartphone apps have also seen constant and large-scale redesigns, with adverts more prominent with the news feed.

The handset is rumoured to be set for a 2013 release.

It could be a major hit – a flash poll of 968 people conducted by MyVoucherCodes found that 32% of phone users would upgrade as soon as it became available.

The key to its success could be porting apps to mobile – something Facebook is already doing. Separate camera and chat apps already separate off some site functions, and third-party apps will shortly be available via  a Facebook app store.

Of those polled, 57% hoped that it would be cheaper than an iPhone – presumably supported by Facebook’s advertising.

Those polled were then asked why they would choose to purchase a Facebook phone, if and when one became available, and were asked to select all reasons that applied to them from a list of possible answers.
