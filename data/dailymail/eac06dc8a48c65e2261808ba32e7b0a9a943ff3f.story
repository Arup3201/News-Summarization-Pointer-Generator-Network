First lady in waiting: Valerie Trierweiler who becomes the first unmarried Première Dame in history

The twice-divorced mother-of-three set to become the new French first lady says she cannot believe her ears when she is described as the equivalent of Michelle Obama.

Valerie Trierweiler, 47, the partner of Francois Hollande, will become the first unmarried ‘Première Dame’ in history to enter the Elysee Palace on the arm of the country's most powerful man.

The feisty magazine journalist was revealed as Mr Hollande’s lover when 
he separated from the mother of his four children, the politician 
Segolene Royal, with whom he lived for 30 years.

She will be at the new president's side as he is sworn in to office next Tuesday and they are expected to move into the Elysee together.

Nicholas Sarkozy and his supermodel wife Carla chose to live together in a townhouse rather than in the cramped palace.

Giving her first interview since Sunday's election, Miss Trierweiler told The Times: 'When you say I'm the equivalent of Michelle Obama, I don't believe my eyes or my ears.'

The mother gained the nickname ‘Rottweiler’ after she slapped a colleague on Paris Match magazine who said something she deemed sexist.

When the magazine put her on its cover 
under the headline ‘Francois Hollande’s charming asset’, she tweeted: 
‘Bravo Paris Match for its sexism ... my thoughts go out to all angry 
women.’

She said as first lady she will relish the role of representing France as an ambassador.

She added: 'This role makes me a little uncomfortable but I will manage very well if it is not limited to just that.

'I want to represent the image of France, do the necessary smiling, be well dressed, but it shouldn't stop there. I will not be une potiche (a decorative vase).'

In the interview, Miss Trierweiler said she is having difficulties coming to terms with not being able to go anywhere without a security guard.

Presidential couple: Francois Hollande with his companion Valerie Trierweiler as they celebrate his election win over Nicolas Sarkozy

When the president and first lady-to-be leave their flat in Paris the whole street has to be cordoned off.

The mother, who has sons aged, 15, 17 and 19, grew up in Loire Valley in central France but has spent most of her adult life in Paris.

She has lived with Mr Hollande - the self-styled 'Mr Normal' who has risen from obscurity to the presidency in a year - since 2007.

Mr Hollande makes much of his roots 
in Rouen, the dull Normandy city that reflects his desired provincial 
image as the hard-working son of a doctor father and social worker 
mother.

His former partner Ségolène Royal was the Socialist candidate in the 2007 presidential election.

A year after the poll the couple announced they were splitting because he was having an affair with Miss Trierweiler.

The journalist says she first met Mr Hollande 23 years ago when she was a political reporter. He was married with a family, but otherwise leading a fairly routine existence.

Now the new president may make an honest first lady of her and marry her - although their future plans remain a closely guarded secret.

She did not get involved in the campaign but said that she discusses politics with him all the time even though she does not interfere with his decision-making.

Despite her new-found public profile, Miss Trierweiler intends to continue her career as a journalist.
