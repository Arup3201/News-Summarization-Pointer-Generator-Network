Sir Phillip Green, the business supremo behind Topshop, has revealed that Kate Moss' high street collection could be set for a comeback.

Speaking in an interview with U.S. magazine, Haute Living, the mogul hinted at a reprise of Kate Moss' famously successful high street range but ruled out letting the Kardashians loose on Topshop.

Asked about doing another collaboration with the model, Green said: 'Who knows? This isn’t a
conversation we’ve had recently, but it could happen. I think we would 
never try to replace Kate. That was a moment, but maybe we could do something again.'

But the billionaire was keen to emphasise that he won't be doing the same with another celebrity Topshop junkie: Kim Kardashian.

'They work with our [Arcadia's] U.K. brand, Dorothy 
Perkins,' he explained. 'I felt that that brand was a fit, as it was akin to what they 
were doing here in the U.S. with Sears. [Dorothy Perkins] is more in line with that brand.'

Another celebrity that Topshop has been courting is Disney star Demi Lovato.

Taking credit for the actress' recent grown-up makeover, Green, whose designer daughter Chloe is a similar age to Lovato, revealed: 'We’ve been working with Demi quietly for the last six months. We’ve been dressing her and helping to develop her.

'My guys have done a great job. We’re just helping out.'

Unusually, the famously discreet Green also chose to speak out about Topshop's legion of celebrity fans, which include the Duchess of Cambridge, Kate Bosworth, who put in an appearance at the launch of the brand's LA store, Kelly Osborne, Cara Delevingne, Jennifer Lopez and Russell Brand.

He said: 'We shop a lot of celebrity people, but in a polite way. We don’t call newspapers. They come and want to shop with us. We respect that.

'That’s a relationship we’ve got with a lot of people who come here. They trust us. It’s important that we respect people’s privacy.'
