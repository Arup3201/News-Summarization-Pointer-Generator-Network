A plastic surgeon has used his body sculpting skills to create his dream woman before proposing to her on their first date.

Dr David Matlock met his bride Veronica, 38, in 2007 when she was 40lbs heavier and visited him seeking what is commonly known as 'designer vagina' surgery after giving birth to her daughter Isabella, now aged nine.

As well as the vaginoplasty, Dr Matlock suggested that the beautiful brunette also undergo a 'Wonder Woman Makeover', involving liposuction of the chin, arms, and legs, and a Brazilian butt lift.

'I couldn't even look into his eyes 
because of the reason I was there,' she said.

'I was so shy and bashful, but he says
 it was love at first sight.'

Dr Matlock then took the now Mrs Matlock out for a date, immediately proposed to her, and has been helping her to enhance her figure ever since.

'I didn't see her weight then, I just knew what I wanted to do,' he said of their first meeting.

'She opted for everything I suggested. Even marriage.'Â

Prior to meeting her 49-year-old husband, full-time nurse Mrs Matlock had undergone three breast augmentations.

She has since had a Brazilian butt lift, vaginal 
rejuvenation, labiaplasty and G-spot shot, liposuction to her chin, arms
 and legs and, most recently, botox injections.

'I feel like I'm a walking advertisement for him,' she said.

And it is not just his wife who has gone under the knife in her own quest for physical perfection - Dr Matlock has himself undergone several procedures that utilise a fat-implant technique called Vaser High Def Liposculpting, which he pioneered.

Man at work: David Matlock was immediately smitten with Veronica, and suggested she also have a 'Wonder Woman Makeover', involving liposuction of the chin, arms, and legs, and a Brazilian butt lift

Healthy living: The couple maintain their perfect physiques with a gruelling diet, fitness regime, and specialist body-sculpting procedures

Six pack: As well as taking an array of food supplements and vitamins to stay in shape, Dr Matlock has had liposculpting done on on his pecs, biceps, and triceps

Made up of live fat from the patient's body, the implants can be injected into the biceps, triceps, calves, or pecs to create a perfectly sculpted, muscular figure.

He is also trialling a procedure that involves injecting blood plasma rather than fat for patients like Dr Matlock who have very little fat.

Dr Matlock, who appeared on the E! reality show Dr 90210, has also had liposculpting done on on his pecs, biceps, and triceps, and Botox injections to enhance his look.

He said: 'I just wanted to take my body to a point where, with exercise and diet, you couldn't get it there.'

Under pressure: Mrs Matlock says that as her husband keeps himself looking good it gives her extra pressure to do the same

Dr Matlock, who treats bodybuilders from all over the USA, added: 'We take out the fat under ultrasonic guidance and inject it into the muscles.

'I can sculpt out the biceps, the triceps, obliques, abs, calves, whatever.'

Both Dr and Mrs Matlock compete in bodybuilding competitions where they show off their flawless physiques, and Mrs Matlock admits that her husband's obsession over fitness and beauty keeps her motivated to look her best.

She entered in the bikini division of her first bodybuilding competition in October, but did not place.

In his first competition, David placed third in the 35 and older Men's Physique division, and fourth in the 45 and older division.

She said: 'Because he keeps himself looking good, it's added pressure. So I feel like I have to look good, you know.'

In
 preparation for a competition, David and Veronica eat six carefully 
planned meals per day, consisting of lean chicken, fish, rice, and 
vegetables. David eats at least 200 grams of protein a day to build lean
 muscle.

Dr Matlock said: 'I always eat healthy. A lot of my business is fat, doing liposuction all the time, but I don't like fat.

'I tell people I watch my weight, and I watch my wife's weight too.'

Mrs Matlock said: 'I know that David loves me for who I am.'

But she added, laughing: 'There's a fat clause there.'

Mrs Matlock said that although the couple are both fitness fanatics her young daughter was not a fan of the healthy food her parents love.

She said: 'We're still working on Isabella, getting her to be more accepting of eating healthy.

'She eats what David cooks, but, if we tell her if she's eating healthy, she says, "No, healthy food doesn't taste good".'

Mrs Matlock admits however that when Dr Matlock is out of the house she will treat her daughter to the occasional snack.

'Her and I, we will spoil ourselves. We get frozen yogurt,' she said.

And despite her parents' love of surgery, Isabella herself says she has no interest in going under the knife when she gets older.

'I would never really want to get surgery, because it's not really you, like I want to be myself,' said the schoolgirl.

Despite the occasional cheat day, Mr Matlock works tirelessly to ensure that he and his wife stay healthy at home.

'We have scales in the house, basically in the master bedroom,' he said.

'I weigh myself, and I do it every single day, sometimes twice a day.

'We also have lot of mirrors around the house. A lot of times, just in the gym, I want to look at our muscles.'

Personal trainer and nutritionist Michele Dagona works with both David and Veronica for up to two hours a day, six days a week to get them competition ready.

Ms Dagona said: 'Competition prep, it's a whole other level of fitness. It's totally outside the box compared to traditional training or nutrition.'
