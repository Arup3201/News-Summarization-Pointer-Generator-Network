Ashley Bell was jailed for four years and nine months after being caught on CCTV raiding a couple's home

A burglar has been jailed after he was caught on a couple's CCTV camera creeping around their bedroom.

Ashley Bell, 27, was unaware that he was being recorded as he raided the couple's property in Solihull, West Midlands, on June 26. 

Bell - wearing a grey hooded tracksuit and black gloves - can be seen carefully tip-toeing around the room before stealing thousands of pounds worth of jewellery.

But officers were easily able to trace the burglar to his home in Coventry on the same day after the family passed on the hidden camera footage to police.

Bell was sentenced to four years and nine months in jail on Friday after he pleaded guilty to burglary at Leamington Crown Court.

The court heard Bell escaped with a luxury £5,000 Brietling watch and other jewellery from the home after breaking a window in the back patio door.

Detective Constable Ian Atherley, from Solihull Police, said: 'Bell thought he was getting away with jewellery worth thousands of pounds but didn’t realise he was being recorded on a hidden camera inside the house.

'We identified him from the clear images really quickly and he was charged a little over 24 hours after the burglary happened.

Bell did not know he was being filmed as he tip-toed around the bedroom and stealing thousands of pounds of jewellery

'The sentence he’s been given sends out a clear message to anyone thinking about breaking into homes - we will catch you and you will end up behind bars.

'He will now be spending several years in prison and the communities of the West Midlands will be safer as a result.'
