Angel di Maria is so impressive in training his Manchester United team-mates can sometimes do no more than 'stop and stare' at the Argentine's silky skills, says Tyler Blackett.

Di Maria has proven one of the few reasons for United fans to celebrate so far this season since his Premier League record move from Real Madrid in the summer.

The forward has scored three goals in five games and provided the same number in assists.

But his performances in training are just as eye-catching, according to 20-year-old defender Blackett.

'He's been amazing,' Blackett tells Match of the Day Magazine.

'He's one of the world's best players and the things that he does in training really make us stop and stare.'

Blackett, who has played six times since being given his Premier League debut by Louis van Gaal this season, says he's happy to have Di Maria on his side rather than trying to stop him.

'The dribbling, the close control, these are things that a lot of players would like to have, but that not everybody's got. He really is special,' says Blackett.

After a slow start to the season, United sit fourth on the table and came into the international break on the back of a win over Everton.

Before David de Gea's heroics maintained their 2-1 lead and maximum points, it was Di Maria who was the difference.

He scored the 27th-minute opener and it was his wayward shot that gave Radamel Falcao the chance to open his goal account for United with an instinctive finish for the winner.

Van Gaal will be expecting a more convincing performance when his side's Premier League campaign resumes on October 20 against West Brom.
