This is Premier League star Steven Nzonzi speaking with police today yards from the spot where his car was involved in a smash with a cyclist.

The Stoke City midfielder allegedly said: 'good luck finding me on foreign plates' before driving off last week, but the millionaire was spotted talking to an officer in Hale, Greater Manchester this afternoon.

The crash led to an amazing 
Twitter campaign backed by Sir Chris Hoy to identify the player, who 
urged his 520,000 followers: 'please find him'.

The star has so far been unavailable for comment but MailOnline can confirm he is the player involved.

Speaking to police: An officer stopped Steven N'Zonzi by his car today less than 100 feet from where he was involved in a smash with a cylist

Incident: Rob Lockhart was cycling through Hale in Trafford at the time Nzonzi allegedly hit him last week

Olympic gold medal cyclist Sir Chris Hoy retweeted the image of the car driving off, and the above altercation between the motorist and Mr Lockhart, and urged the public to help detectives catch him

In question: Stoke midfielder Nzonzi is the Premier League player has been sought in connection with the incident

Today witnesses said the French 
footballer was shopping and parked 100 yards from where the altercation 
took place last week, and the officer waited next to his matt-black Audi Q7 for him to return.

Greater
Manchester Police said they have identified the driver and plan to 
speak to him at an appointment to be arranged for next week.

It is understood the 24-year-old French 
midfielder, who joined Stoke from Blackburn for £3million last summer, 
has been advised by lawyers not to speak out in case it becomes a police
matter.

Rob Lockhart said the driver refused to swap insurance details after the incident last week because 'it didn't apply' when an accident involves a bike and a car

Stoke manager Mark Hughes said today the player will play against Manchester City this weekend.

He said: 'I spoke to Steven about it and he basically told me the situation. He doesn't feel he's done anything wrong and that's the top and bottom of it.

'I asked him about it and his explanation was clear, he was unequivocal about it. Will there be an investigation from the club? Absolutely not'.

Greater Manchester Police have requested CCTV from a Hale bank so they can view the incident in detail

After hearing of the altercation, Olympic 
legend Hoy retweeted a picture of the car and urged the public to help 
detectives identify him.

The cyclist, Rob Lockhart, claims the 
player’s matt-black Audi Q7 braked suddenly in Hale, near Manchester, 
last Thursday night and he bruised his face and damaged his bike after 
smashing into the back.

Mr Lockhart said: ‘He pulled away and 
then pulled over sharply to park on double yellow lines outside a cash 
point. It was dangerous.

‘I hit the back window with my head, helmet and face. I had mild concussion for two to three days afterwards.

‘He got out of his car and said, 
“Sorry, I didn’t see you”. Then he just walked to the cashpoint. I 
didn’t feel he had any regard for me and what had just happened. He 
didn’t seem to care. 

‘I was in shock, checking myself,  the
bike and the car to see what was damaged. When he walked back to his 
car I said we need to exchange insurance details and he said “No”. He 
said, “You’re on a bike and I’m in a car, it doesn’t matter”. He was 
really laid back, not angry. He didn’t even check if his car was 
damaged.

‘I tried to get my phone out to take a
picture and he laughed and said, “You won’t trace me because my plates 
are foreign”. He then left the scene.

‘I called the police when I got home. I
don’t know who he was, he had a foreign accent. I don’t follow 
football. I just want all this sorted out.’

Support: Olympic hero Sir Chris Hoy backed a Twitter campaign to identify the player

Message: Sir Chris Hoy retweeted the message and the attached pictures to his 529,000 followers

Two witnesses took photos of the car 
and driver, which Lockhart shared on Twitter. Hoy was among thousands to
retweet the pictures and users soon responded by linking Nzonzi.

Hoy retweeted: ‘This chap said “good 
luck finding me on foreign plates” after knocking a cyclist over in 
Hale. Please help find him.’

Stoke have refused to comment about Nzonzi’s involvement in the alleged incident.

A spokesman for Greater Manchester 
Police said: ‘On Thursday 5 September 2013, police received a report of a collision taking place at about 5.45pm, at the junction of Victoria Road and Ashley Road in Hale, Trafford.

'A cyclist had been in collision with an Audi Q7, but failed to give full details at the scene. The man suffered only minor injuries.

'The cyclist took a picture of the Audi, which was a matted black colour and was on French registration plates.

'Police have now identified the driver involved and arrangements are being made to speak with this man in the near future'.

Sorry we are unable to accept comments for legal reasons.
