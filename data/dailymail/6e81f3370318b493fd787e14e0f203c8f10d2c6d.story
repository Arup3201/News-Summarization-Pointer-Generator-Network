A fisherman has described his terrifying ordeal lost at sea after falling off his lobster trawler and into the Atlantic Ocean - 40 miles from shore.

John Aldridge, 45, had been alone on the deck of his boat the Anna Mary, with his partner asleep below, when a hook on to which he was holding snapped and propelled him off the end of the open boat into the chilly waters off Long Island.

He yelled for help but the boat, on autopilot, was quickly out of sight, its disappearing lights a sign of how desperate a situation he was in.

Mr Aldridge shared his remarkable tale of survival with the New York Times.

He
 runs a successful lobster and crab business with school friend Mr Sosinski after moving
to Montauk to take up fishing and buying the vessel the Anna Mary in 2006.

The business partners were on one of the twice-weekly, 18-hour overnight trips when near tragedy occurred at 3.30am on July 24, 2013.

Once in the water, Mr Aldridge managed to stay afloat by taking off his bulky green rubber fishing boots, 
trapping air in each one and lodging them under his armpits while he kept treading water.

The weather was clear and the water, although not warm, the seasoned fisherman was able to stand.

As dawn approached, he made plans to 
attach himself to something larger in the water so that he would be more
 visible to rescue teams. It was then he saw two shark fins circling. 
He grabbed his knife from his pocket and waited for them to approach but
 thankfully, they swam away.

Lucky: John Aldridge, 45, fell off his lobster boat into the Atlantic off Long Island last summer and was rescued off the coast of the New York island

Mr Aldridge set out on his boat the Anna Mary from Montauk harbor in Long Island, New York last July only for disaster to strike

Several
 hours later, Mr Aldridge's partner Anthony Sosinski awoke and quickly realized 
with horror that his friend had become lost at sea at some point in the nine hours he had been below deck. The Anna Mary was at this point now 60 miles off shore.

He immediately alerted the coastguard in New Haven and a desperate search began. Soon
 a mission was in full swing - two coast guard boats were sent from 
Montauk, two helicopters and a plane left Boston while a cutter from New
 York redirected itself to the east.

The
 coastguard issued instructions that a man had gone overboard between 
five and 60 miles off shore - a vast search area the size of Rhode 
Island, almost impossible to cover by a search team alone.

At best estimates, experts worked out that Mr Aldridge could survive 19 hours in the water.

The lost fisherman had one thing in his favor - a new search-and-rescue computer program put in place in 2007 - which analyzed wind and ocean currents to work out at what points he would most likely be.

However despite the reliability of the machinery, there was one fatal flaw. Search and rescue teams believed that Mr Aldridge likely fell overboard at 10.30pm - when in fact he fell into the water five hours later.

The initial search and rescue mission was massively skewed.

However one coast guard Pete Winters was having second thoughts about relying so heavily on technology.

He
 spoke to the distraught Captain Sosinski to learn more. Sosinski revealed that his partner 
had been preparing the boat to receive the day's catch, meaning the boat
 would have been further from shore.

A new set of data was entered and the search for the lost seamen altered to coordinates further south.

After Mr Aldridge's parents were informed of his disappearance and as the news spread among the fishing community of Montauk, 21 commercial boats joined the search for the missing man.

While the search mission intensified, Mr Aldridge floated alone on the sea. His legs were cramping as he searched for a buoy to hang on to, the sun blinded him and he was suffering from exhaustion and thirst.

After several hours of searching, he found a small buoy to hang on to but his physical state was deteriorating after nine hours in the water. The veteran fisherman was shaking and sea lice had attached themselves to his thin clothes.

He could see the planes overhead but they were too far east, so using the last of his strength he began to swim.Â 

Once again he saw his boat the Anna Mary ahead of him - but it was just out of reach. Fortunately, he soon reached another buoy. He clung to the rope attached to it and stuck his rubber boots under his arms to keep him afloat.

Meanwhile, the rescue crews found false alarm after false alarm. They knew that the chances of rescue were slim - each time someone fell into the Atlantic, the likelihood was that they drowned.

Finally as one of the helicopters began its last search mission of the day on its final liters of fuel, there he was - John Aldridge floating in the water below them, clinging to his rubber boots.

Mr Aldridge was flown to hospital in Cape Cod suffering from hypothermia, dehydration and exposure. However he has suffered no lasting ill-health or post-traumatic stress from the incident.

He has returned to work and with it, to the sea.
