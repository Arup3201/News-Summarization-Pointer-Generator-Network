Former AC Milan and Croatia star Zvonimir Boban has laid into Manchester United midfielder Marouane Fellaini, claiming the £27.5million man 'can't play football' after Belgium's goalless draw with Wales on Sunday.

Fellaini, who played the full 90 minutes for Belgium against Chris Coleman's Wales side, was involved in a controversial incident when he appeared to elbow Liverpool's Joe Allen.

The United midfielder managed to avoid going into referee Pavel Kralovec's book but was unable to escape Boban's public criticism.

Boban, who played for AC Milan for 11 years and won four Serie A titles and one Champions League, said: 'Fellaini can't play football. Seriously he can't play football,' reported the Daily Mirror:

The former Yugoslavia and Croatia midfielder's criticism comes just as Fellaini has started to look settled in United's starting line-up following his return from an ankle injury.

The 26-year-old has been a regular in Louis van Gaal's plans since he came off the substitutes bench to score his first competitive goal for his current club against West Brom.

Fellaini struggled for form during his first season at Old Trafford but recently revealed he felt he was being used as a scapegoat during his time under former manager David Moyes. 

The former Everton star will be hoping to be involved from the start against Arsenal at the weekend.
