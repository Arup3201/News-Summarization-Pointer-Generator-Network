Spanish officials were  compared to Zimbabwean dictator Robert Mugabe yesterday after they violated international law by opening a British diplomatic bag at the border with Gibraltar.

The Foreign Office said last Friday’s incident, in which Guardia Civil officers stopped a courier travelling from the Rock into Spain, was ‘completely unacceptable’.

It is not known what was in the bag or why police wanted to search it, something that has not happened since a diplomatic bag was opened in Zimbabwe 13 years ago.

Diplomatic bags, used to carry important and confidential correspondence, are inviolable.

The Foreign Office condemned  the 'serious infringement' of the 1961 Vienna Convention on Diplomatic Relations. 

Ukip
 MEP  William Dartmouth,  who represents the Rock in the European 
Parliament, said: ‘The last time a British diplomatic bag was opened in 
this way was by Mugabe’s Zimbabwe. ‘Is that really the company Madrid wishes to keep?’

Tensions have risen since July after Gibraltar dropped concrete blocks in its waters to create what is said was an artificial reef to encourage sea life to flourish in a marine reserve

The FCO spokesman said: 'There are long-established and internationally-accepted Articles concerning use of the diplomatic bag to which the FCO adheres. We expect other parties to the Convention, including EU and NATO allies, to do the same.

'We take very seriously any reported abuse of the protocol surrounding use of the diplomatic bag. We have asked the Spanish authorities to investigate what occurred and take action to ensure it does not happen again.

'As far as we are concerned there is no justification for this infringement of the UK’s rights under the Vienna Convention.'

The sovereignty of Gibraltar is a major source of tension between the UK and Spain.

Both in 1967 and 2002, the people of Gibraltar rejected proposals for Spanish sovereignty.

Yet, despite this, Spain still asserts a claim to the territory.

The tension began in 1704 when an Anglo-Dutch force captured Gibraltor from Spain during the war of the Spanish succession.

The territory was then ceded to Britain under the Treaty of Utrecht in 1713.

Historically, it has proved to be an important base for the Royal Navy.

Now, its economy is based on tourism, financial services and shipping.

Under the 2006 constitution of Gibraltar, the territory governs its own affairs although defence and foreign relations are still the responsibility of the UK Government.

Located on the southern end of the Iberian Peninsula, it is an area of 6.8 square kilometres.

Tensions
 have risen since July, when Gibraltar dropped concrete blocks in its 
waters to create an artificial reef for sea life. The Spanish say it 
prevented their fishermen from working.

Madrid responded by imposing tighter border controls, leading to long delays at the frontier.

Last week Spain instructed a state 
research vessel to take water samples and survey the contested area 
which it says effects Spanish fishermen.

Earlier
 this month, the Spanish ambassador was summoned to the Foreign Office 
over what was said to be an unauthorised incursion into Gibraltarian 
waters by a Spanish survey vessel.

It
 was the third time the Spanish ambassador had been publicly summoned 
over the Gibraltar issue since the current Spanish government took 
office in December 2011.

The
 Spanish Minister for Agriculture, Food and the Environment, Miguel 
Arias Cañete, said on Monday that Spain would take the UK to the 
European Court of Justice if the European Commission failed to take 
action over the reef works.

In August Britain sent ten warships, 
including aircraft carrier Illustrious, to take part in military 
exercises in British waters, with three ships, including HMS 
Westminster, stopping at a base on the island.

Royal Navy patrol boat HMS Sabre (pictured) intercepted a Spanish survey ship and asked it to leave British Gibraltar waters, but it refused. The Spanish ambassador has now been summoned to explain

Despite
 the move following just days after Gibraltar's chief minister asked for
 more ships, British officials said the exercise was routine.

Britain was given Gibraltar in the 1713 Treaty of Utrecht, but Spain has said it will never renounce its claim to sovereignty.

British sources said Gibraltar suffered frequent illegal incursions into its waters by Spanish boats, including police and naval vessels.

From December last year to April, officials recorded 176 illegal incursions by Spanish boats.
