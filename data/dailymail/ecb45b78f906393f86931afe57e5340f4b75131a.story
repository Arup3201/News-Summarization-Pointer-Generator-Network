The Air Force Academy in Colorado Springs has ordered an urgent investigation into the school's sports teams after shocking allegations emerged on Sunday of endemic rape, recreational drug use and academic cheating, primarily among football players at the institution.

Lieutenant General Michelle Johnson said in a statement that she told the U.S. Inspector General's office to look into the 'troubling' allegations, including claims that women were plied with date-rape drugs and then assaulted - specifically at parties dating from 2010.

'These efforts will help in eliminating subcultures at the Air Force's Academy whose climates do not align with our institutional core values,' said Johnson, who graduated from the facility in 1981.

Troubling probe: The probe was announced following a report in the Colorado Springs Gazette newspaper, which chronicled a pattern of recruiting irregularities, preferential treatment given to student-athletes by certain professors, drug use by cadets, and alcohol-fueled parties

The academy, located in Colorado Springs, has a student body of 4,000, known collectively as the Cadet Wing. Graduates of the school are commissioned as 2nd lieutenants in the Air Force.

The probe was announced following a report in the Colorado Springs Gazette newspaper, which chronicled a pattern of recruiting irregularities, preferential treatment given to student-athletes by certain professors, drug use by cadets, and alcohol-fueled parties.

While Johnson's statement referenced the misconduct in general terms, the Gazette reported that at a Dec. 2011 off-campus party, cadets smoked 'spice,' a synthetic compound that mimics the effects of marijuana.

When Johnson was appointed last year as the first female superintendent in the academy's 60-year history, it was widely viewed as an effort to change the culture at the school.

In 2003, reports surfaced that dozens of female Air Force Academy cadets had been sexually assaulted by fellow cadets over the previous decade, but that academy officials ignored or downplayed their complaints.

The Gazette reported that in the 2012-2013 school year, 45 Air Force cadets reported sexual assaults, representing 'nearly two-thirds' of all assaults reported at the nation's three major military academies.

The Gazette reviewed hundreds of pages of documents obtained under the Freedom of Information Act that shed new light on the 2011 party and an earlier one in 2010.

Air Force investigators looked into allegations of heavy drinking and drug use at both parties, and claims of the use of date-rape drugs and sexual misconduct at the 2011 party, the documents showed.

Several weeks after the 2010 party, investigators seized synthetic marijuana during a raid on six dorm rooms. Twenty-one cadets were expelled and five resigned, but it's not known how many were athletes.

No one was prosecuted as a direct result of the 2011 party, but it prompted an investigation of 32 cadets for alleged misconduct.

Johnson said three cadets were court-martialed, convicted and expelled — two football players and a female basketball player. Five other athletes received administrative punishment that resulted in expulsion, and six cadets resigned.

Three other cadets were expelled for what was described as unrelated misconduct.

Johnson said the alleged drug use and sexual misconduct 'obviously is unacceptable.'

She also said academic standards have been raised for the academy's preparatory school, which helps athletes and other potential cadets meet the institution's admission requirements.

Mueh acknowledged that some Air Force athletes convicted of crimes or found culpable for other violations never should have been recruited.

'Obviously, we shouldn't have brought any of them in — in hindsight,' he said.

Mueh and head football coach Troy Calhoun said the school is now focusing more on the character of potential recruits, interviewing teachers, school janitors, parents and neighbors.

Coaches have been told if they ignore a recruit's problems or an athlete's misconduct, they will be fired, Calhoun said.

'If you're an enabler in any way, if you're tolerating — that's out of line,' he said. 'You're not going to work here.'

Johnson said that after she became superintendent in August 2013, she noticed some cadets were more loyal to teams, cliques or friends than they were to the school's honor code.

The code states, 'We will not lie, steal, or cheat, nor tolerate among us anyone who does. Furthermore, I resolve to do my duty and to live honorably.'

Johnson said the investigation, the new standards, her expectations for coaches and the new programs in the athletic department are designed to root out what she called 'certain subcultures' that are out of step with the school's standards of commitment and respect.

She said all cadets are being told to take greater responsibility for discipline, and if they see misconduct, they are ordered to protect victims and take steps to ensure lawbreakers are punished.

A few cadets will still make 'poor choices,' Johnson said, but she pledged to focus on creating a better culture.
