JPMorgan Chase & Co CEO Jamie Dimon has throat cancer and will undergo radiation and chemotherapy treatment this summer, he has revealed.

Dimon, a 58-year-old married father of three, disclosed his condition in a memo late on Tuesday addressed to the New York company's employees and shareholders.

He will remain as CEO and continue to run one of the world's largest banks while he undergoes eight weeks of radiation and chemotherapy at Memorial Sloan Kettering Hospital in New York, he wrote.

'The good
 news is that the prognosis from my doctors is excellent, the cancer was
 caught quickly, and my condition is curable,' he wrote. 'I feel very good now and will let all of you know if my health situation changes.'

Diagnosis: JPMorgan Chase & Co Chief Executive Officer Jamie Dimon, pictured last year, has revealed that he has throat cancer but said that his prognosis is good because it was caught early

Dimon said the cancer remains confined to his throat and adjacent lymph nodes on the right side of his neck. He has received a biopsy, a CT Scan and a PET scan, he said.

He shared the news on Tuesday night because the diagnosis forced him to cancel a five-country client trip, which would have seen him meet with the prime ministers of Italy and Greece.

Despite canceling the trip, he will continue to head up the bank and will undergo treatment during a summer vacation.

'He is going to be actively involved in the business every day,' Joe Evangelisti, a corporate spokesman, told USA Today on Tuesday night.

Evangelisti added that no specific individual will take over Dimon's responsibilities as he is treated.

Dimon joined the firm in 2004 before taking over as CEO in December 2005 and adding the chairman title in December 2006. It makes him Chase's longest-serving top official - but the term has not been without its issues.

In September, JPMorgan Chase 
admitted wrongdoing and was fined around $920 million in a settlement 
of the bank's 2012 'London whale' trading debacle.

Support: Dimon is pictured with his wife Judith as they arrive for a state dinner hosted Obama at the White House in 2011. Dimon, 58, joined the company in 2004 before taking over as CEO in 2005

Family: Dimon's family, including his wife and three daughters, made headlines last year when they sent out this Christmas card showing them hitting tennis balls around their pricey home

In one of the biggest trading scandals to hit the finance world, a group of London-based traders working in the firm's Chief Investment Office made huge bets on complex financial instruments and then covered up their losses for months.

One of the traders, French-born Bruno Iksil, was nicknamed the London Whale because of the size of his bets.

JPMorgan
 initially said the trades, which racked up an around $6.2
 billion in losses, had been a hedge against risk and Dimon called it a 'tempest in a teapot' in a statement.

He later conceded: ‘We have accepted responsibility and acknowledged our mistakes from the start, and we have learned from them and worked to fix them.’

His family has also made headlines for their questionable choices; they were branded ‘tone deaf’ after releasing a decadent Christmas card in which they hit tennis balls around their palatial home.

In the photo Dimon was pictured gleefully swinging his tennis racket as his wife Judy, their three daughters, Julia, Laura and Kara Leigh, laugh.

MSNBC host Chris Hayes said it was as if 
the Dimon family were saying: ‘Hey, we’re so rich we can destroy our own
 stuff’, whilst The Atlantic magazine said it was ‘braggy and opulent’

Dimon earns more than $18.7m a year, making him one of the best compensated bosses in America.

On Wednesday morning - following the Tuesday night announcement - shares were down 30 cents, or 0.52 per cent.

Message from Chairman and CEO Jamie Dimon

Dear Colleagues and Shareholders,

I wanted to let you know that I have just been diagnosed with throat cancer. The good news is that the prognosis from my doctors is excellent, the cancer was caught quickly, and my condition is curable. Following thorough tests that included a CAT scan, PET scan and a biopsy, the cancer is confined to the original site and the adjacent lymph nodes on the right side of my neck. Importantly, there is no evidence of cancer elsewhere in my body.

My evaluation and treatment plan are still being finalized, but at this time it appears I will begin radiation and chemotherapy treatment shortly at Memorial Sloan Kettering Hospital, which should take approximately eight weeks. While the treatment will curtail my travel during this period, I have been advised that I will be able to continue to be actively involved in our business, and we will continue to run the company as normal. Our Board has been fully briefed and is totally supportive.

As you all know, we have outstanding leaders across our businesses and functions - the best team I've ever had the privilege of working with - so our company will move forward together with confidence as we continue to deliver first-class results for our customers, communities and shareholders.

I feel very good now and will let all of you know if my health situation changes.

I appreciate your support and want to thank our employees for the amazing work they do day-in and day-out. I'm very proud to be part of this company and honored to be working with such an exceptional group of people.

Jamie
