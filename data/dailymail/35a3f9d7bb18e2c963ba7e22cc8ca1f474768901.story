According to popular myth, the price of Christmas gets more expensive every year - but this is not necessarily the case. 

A glance through a copy of the 1982 Boots Christmas catalogue shows that a video recorder cost a month's average wage, while today, a decent quality DVD recorder, will set you back, approximately half-a-week's.

Figures compiled by the Office for National Statistics show that although prices are now more than three times higher than at the end of the 1980s, the cost of technology has either stayed relatively stable, or in many cases, fallen dramatically.

A Ferguson video recorder similar to this cost £599 in 1982 which was the equivalent to a month's wages

In the 1980s a Braun hand blender, left, cost £9.95 (£30 in today's money) while its modern equivalent, right, costs £18.99 on the Argos website, and unlike 1982, it is possible to get it delivered home with one click

A Braun hand blender, which would have seemed exotic, in time before the television schedules were packed with cookery shows, cost £9.95 - which when inflation is taken into account - would be worth in the region of £30 today.

An equivalent version today costs about £18.99 on the Argos website, although shoppers in 1982 did not get the option of Click and Collect. 

In 1982 a Ferguson VHS video recorder  was a highly desirable piece of equipment as it allowed people the flexibility to record live television and return to it at a later date. What made it inaccessible to many, was the price of £599. In today's money, that would be around £1,830. Workers earned on average £136.50, which meant that you would have to work for more than four weeks to afford the video recorder.

Today, the VHS recorder is no longer available following the increase in popularity of DVD systems. A Sony DVD recorder with a hard drive can be bought for less than £200. As the average wage is around £480, the new DVD machine can cost a few days' pay - although for the true bargain hunter, simple DVD players can be purchased for just £30. 

For children waking up on Christmas morning there was rarely a better sight than a £95 Atari (£300 today)

Over the years, the basic shape may be similar, and at around £350, is broadly similar in price to the Atari

A generous parent who paid almost £100 for an Atari soon realised that if they did not want to miss the next thrilling episode of The Professionals, they often had to spend a further £180 for a 14-inch portable television

Paul O'Donnell, of the Manufacturing and Technologies Association told The Guardian: 'The big trend over the last 30 years has been the globalisation of manufacturing. Production that would have been done in the UK, Europe or North America has moved to the far east. That started taking prices down and it really got turbo-charged in the 90s.'

The early 1980s led to the production of a range of electronic educational gifts for children, with gadgets such as Texas Instruments' Speak and Spell, worth £33.95 - around £100 today. Now any parent can download an emulator app for their smart phone.

However, the most envied children were those who returned to school in January 1983 with tales of a new Atari video games system. Their parents had to pay £95 - almost £300 today.

No games system was complete without a few cartridges such as these which cost around £25 (£77 today)

Meanwhile, today's high-tech video games cost in the region of £50-60, which is slightly cheaper than 1982

While people may remember the Atari, the gold standard machine of the time was the Mattel Intellivision video computer which cost £150 - almost £470 today. 

The children would quite happily plug their games system into the back of the £260 20-inch colour television in the living room (£800 today) but that could cause discord. 

Parents who treated their children to a video games system were often forced to buy a second television, because unless they had their rather expensive video recorder, they would miss out on the latest episode of The Professionals.

Instead, many parents decided the simpler option was to pay £180 for a 14-inch portable (£560 today), which they could set up in their bedroom. 

Today a Playstation 4 or XBox One cost between £350-£400, while an 50-inch LG Smart TV costs £499, while a 40-inch JVC LED tv costs £199.

In 1982, educational toys such as Speak and Maths were very popular, but are now free mobile phone apps

The average weekly wage  was £136.50, meaning the machine was one month's pay

An Atari games system was £95 which is around £300 in today's money

That compares reasonably well to a £350 Playstation 4 or Xbox One

@highlight

But games in 1982 cost £25 which works out at almost £80 today 

@highlight

Games for the Playstation 4 or Xbox One cost around £50-£60

Also families in 1982 often had to buy a second TV at £189 for a 14-inch
