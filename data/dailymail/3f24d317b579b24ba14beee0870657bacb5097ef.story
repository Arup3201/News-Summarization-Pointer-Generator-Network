A cash-strapped student is pleading for the safe return of his beloved vintage car after it was stolen from outside his house – and is offering a reward of 'love and affection' to anyone who finds it.

Ben Wheldon-Bayes, 20, said he was devastated when he popped outside to get something from his 30-year-old brown B-reg Austin Mini only to find it had been stolen.

The civil engineering student had driven home from Southampton University for Christmas and parked the motor - nicknamed Edna - outside his family home in Reading, Berkshire.

Ben Wheldon-Bayes, 20, parked his 30-year-old brown B-reg Austin Mini (pictured) outside his family home in Reading, Berkshire, on Saturday but noticed it had vanished when he went to unpack it just a few hours later

The civil engineering student had driven home from Southampton University for Christmas just hours before it was taken. He is now pleading for any information about its whereabouts and will offer 'love and affection'

He said he noticed his beloved car had disappeared when he went to unload it on Saturday evening.

He is now desperate to see his car returned, and said that while he cannot offer a cash reward, he will 'shower love and affection' on anyone who can help.  

His Facebook post appealing for his car's return has already been shared more than 16,000 times around the country.

It says: 'My car has been stolen from outside my house in Reading some time between 6.30pm and 2am last night (Saturday).

'Any info etc. would be greatly appreciated, can't really offer a reward but I'll shower you with love and affection.

'Someone please give my car back, it's Christmas.'

Speaking at his parent's large red-brick home today, the third year student said the car was his 'pride and joy'.

Mr Wheldon-Bayes, 20 (above), saved up for years for the vintage car and said he is 'devastated' that it has been taken. He hopes it will be safely returned

'I saved up for years for the car,' he said.

'All my birthday money, Christmas money, and I had a job in Asda.

'It was my pride and joy and I was so happy driving it.'

Mr Wheldon-Bayes had owned the vintage brown Mini for three years, and it was his first car after passing his test.

The penniless student said that while he would be unable to offer anyone a financial reward for the safe return of his car, he would do anything he could to thank them.

He said: 'I would be overjoyed. I don't know what I'd do. I'd be shocked if I got it back.

'It would be incredible to have it back. It is my favourite thing in the world at the moment.'

Of the online support, he said: 'It's wicked, it's lovely. So many people have messaged me.

'More than 16,000 people have shared my Facebook post, and that's strangers, people I don't even have mutual friends with.

'Loads of people have contacted me and suggested things that might have happened.'

He believes thieves took the car and may have sold it on for parts since there's a huge market for the older models.

He had only recently saved up enough money to insure the car again after having it in storage for two years, but was in the process of sorting out special classic car coverage when it was taken.

'I don't think I'll get a penny,' he said. 

His father John, 71, said he worked hard to get the car and appealed to anyone with information to contact the family.

He said: 'I just think Ben worked really hard to get the car. I really respected Ben working to afford the car.'
