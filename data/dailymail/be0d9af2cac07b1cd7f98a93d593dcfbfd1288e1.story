A teenager was strangled to death by her scarf in a freak go-karting accident after being given no safety instructions before she took to the track, an inquest heard.

Suzanne Cornwell, 18, was fatally injured when the garment got caught in the engine of her kart during an out-of-hours race in December 2009 - the first time she had ever tried the sport.

An inquest into her death today in Huntingdon, Cambridgeshire, heard how Suzanne was one of six friends invited to the track by employee Andy Kivlin.

But Mr Kivlin failed to give the novice driver any safety advice, or tell her to wear protective overalls and remove her scarf, which was standard practise for normal bookings at the track.

After the accident, Mr Kivlin ‘panicked’ and told one of the group to  cancel the 999 call, saying he would take her to hospital in his car, the hearing was told.

The coroner also heard how Mr Kivlin had not been given permission by the owner to let his friends use the track.

It also emerged another member of the group, Melissa Rees-Howell, who was Mr Kivlin’s girlfriend at the time, had been told to remove her scarf by him on a previous out-of-hours session.

Coroner David Morris heard evidence from Christopher Hamilton, who used to work at the raceway, that the DVD player used to show customers a safety film had broken and not been replaced.

He said: 'If you saw anyone with long hair or baggy clothes you told them to tuck it in. It was the same with shoe laces.

'I felt I was thrown into the deep end. I wasn’t given any training for the safety briefings and I didn’t feel confident.

'About a month in, the DVD player broke and was not replaced, so all briefings had to be given verbally.

'I left because of the lack of pay and because I was being messed about. It wasn’t well organised.'

Recalling the night, he said: 'I believed everyone had been karting before and was confident in what they were doing. Andy was the man in charge.'

Cambridgeshire Raceway Volunteer manager Paul Shinn, who was Mr Kivlin's boss, told the inquest he had trusted him not to let people on the track out-of-hours.

He said: 'Helmets are compulsory and 
neck braces are optional to those over 16. Customers have to sign a 
disclaimer before using the kart.

'If
you have a scarf on, you take it off. They would be told at reception, 
at the briefing and if they still had it, I would take it off.'

Mr Shinn described getting a phone call from Mr Kivlin on the night of Suzanne’s death.

He told the hearing: 'Andy told me he had f***** up. Andy sounded upset but not hysterical.

'I
rang Phil [the owner] and left a message with his wife. Phil spoke with
Andy on the phone. Phil told me we did not need to attend and I went 
home.

'Andy did not have permission to have anybody on the course after hours. I have never known it to happen before.'

He added: 'The only authority Andy had was over the track as a marshall when I was there and that is it.

'I remember saying to him you know you have lost your job. I was more gutted that I trusted him.'

Suzanne,
from Hardwick, near Cambridge, was rushed to hospital after her scarf 
got caught in the rear axle of her go-kart on December 11, 2009.

Huntingdon Law Courts heard William Hitchcock called for an ambulance, but Mr Kivlin told him to cancel it.

William said: 'Andy said stop calling them, I will take her in the car myself. I told the ambulance it was not needed.

'I think he was panicked about the situation and he did not want to get into any trouble. She had started to come round.

'I decided to call back. Suzi was getting clearly worse.'

She died the next day in Addenbrooke’s Hospital.

A post mortem carried out by Home Office Pathologist Dr Benjamin Swift recorded the medical cause of death as ligature strangulation.

Suzanne was studying at Long Road Sixth Form College in Cambridge and lived with her father David, mother Wendy and older brother Stuart.

South Cambridgeshire District Council has been given until the end of October to complete a health and safety report into the incident.

The inquest also heard staff at Cambridgeshire Raceway were paid a £40 day rate cash-in-hand, but Coroner Morris ruled the running of the company was not a matter for the inquest.

The inquest, which is expected to conclude tomorrow, was expected to hear from Suzanne’s brother Stuart this afternoon.
