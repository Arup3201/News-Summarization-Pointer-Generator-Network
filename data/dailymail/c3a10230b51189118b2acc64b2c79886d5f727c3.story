Newtown, CT. voters have accepted a $50 million grant from the state of Connecticut to build a new Sandy Hook Elementary School, the site of last year's school massacre.

State lawmakers had set aside the money 
to help the town build a new school to replace the one where a gunman 
killed 26 people last December. Connecticut officials said the state was
willing to allocate all of the $50 million to the new school.

The unofficial results Saturday were 4,504 for the grant offer and 558 against. The vote was essentially a formality since a task force of Newtown officials decided in May in favor of a plan to tear down the school and build a new one. Sandy Hook students have been attending classes at a school in neighboring Monroe.

Students of Sandy Hook were relocated to Chalk Hill School in Monroe where all the furniture was replaced to turn it into an exact replica

Trauma: A group of young students - some crying, others looking visibly frightened - being escorted following the shootings at Sandy Hook last year

Chalk Hill School in Monroe, Connecticut
had been empty since June 2011. Volunteers and town officials worked to make the school suitable for the traumatized children.

Twenty
students, aged just six and seven, were killed by a gunman last year at
Sandy Hook school in Newtown along with six teaching staff.

Monroe police Lt. Brian McCauleymade sure that authorities secured the school so that it was safe when Newtown officials sent teachers and students there.

Close to 100 per cent of the furniture, down to the teachers' desks, were brought Chalk Hill to create an exact replica of Sandy Hook. Chalk Hill had been due to be turned into a recreation center prior to the tragedy.

Students were terrified following the incident. Eric Millgrem told the Today show a year ago that his daughter Lauren was too traumatized to return to school immediately after.

She hid in a bathroom with her classmates as children were gunned down in the room next door at Sandy Hook elementary. The little girl lost nine of her friends.

Her father said: 'She's just too afraid, she doesn't want to go to any school.'

Teachers also said that they would need 
time to heal before returning to the classroom as they struggled to come
to terms with the loss of colleagues and students that they loved dearly.

There was a long funeral service following the massacre for the pupils who were killed along with six members of the teaching staff at Sandy Hook.

Moving: Fire officials waited for the procession at the main intersection in the Sandy Hook village

Touching: The firefighters look on as Barden's family, including his 12-year-old brother James, arrives

Seven-year-old Daniel Barden was laid to
rest on Wednesday of last year. The little boy's brother and sister arrived at St Rose of 
Lima Church at 10am with their parents, while local firefighters 
somberly formed an honour guard along the road for Daniel who one day 
dreamed of joining their ranks.

Four children - Jessica Rekos, James Mattioli, Jack Pinto and Noah Pozner, all six years old - were  also remembered

Two more children - Charlotte Bacon and Caroline Previdi, both six - and a teacher - Vicki Soto, 27 - were also laid to rest. Soto, 27, has been hailed a hero for 
trying to save children from the gunman at Sandy Hook ,shielding them with her body.

She is believed to have hid the youngsters in her classroom closet before confronting the gunman telling
them the children were at the other end of the school.

Newtown police Lt. George Sinko said he 'would find it very difficult' for students to return to the same school where they came so close to death.

But he added: 'We want to keep these kids together. They need to support each other.

Once the school is rebuilt, students will be able to return to a new, hopefully happier Sandy Hook. The former school was torn down so that students don't need to associate last year's incident with the new construction. 

Whether or not students have the courage to attend their new Sandy Hook school is still to be determined.
