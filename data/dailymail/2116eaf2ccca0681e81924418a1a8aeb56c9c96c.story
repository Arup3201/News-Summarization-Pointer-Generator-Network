Unlike other cats and dogs, Santos and Blakely don't fight.

Cincinnati Zoo has released an adorable video of ocelot kitten, Santos, playing with his puppy friend, Blakely, for the last time yesterday.

The kindhearted companion dog can be seen nuzzling the kitten, as Santos playfully pats him away.

But for zookeepers, the tender moment was bittersweet.

Too cute for words: Cincinnati Zoo has released adorable footage of little ocelot kitten, Santos, playing with his puppy pal one last time before he moves out of the nursery

The pair have spent nearly every day together since Santos was brought into the zoo's nursery about 11-weeks ago, because his mother didnâ€™t produce enough milk to feed him.

But now, Santos is leaving the nursery for the Cat Ambassador Program, which gives zoo visitors the opportunity to see leash-trained cats up close without bars.

According to the zoo's Facebook
 page, Santos was born November 2 at the Abilene Zoo in Texas.

He'll 
become a part of the Cincinnati Zoo's Cheetah Encounter Show in the 
summer of 2014.

Blakely, a companion dog for new and baby animals in the zoo's nursery, will continue his important work.
