Dr Liz Dawson specialises in coronary heart disease and diabetes, but her habit of prescribing medicine for the cat became ‘common knowledge’ at her surgery

A GP has been prescribing insulin needles and chemotherapy drugs – for her sister’s pet cat.

Dr Liz Dawson specialises in coronary heart disease and diabetes, but her habit of prescribing medicine for the cat became ‘common knowledge’ at her surgery.

The 35-year old justified the prescriptions by saying she ‘knew how expensive medication was when prescribed by the vet’.

Many pet owners will be aware of the painful cost of vets’ bills – but Dr Dawson’s sister, Julia Wallace, 37, sends her daughter to the £10,000-a-year Warwick Preparatory School and lives in a large detached house.

Between June and December 2013, Dr Dawson – who practises at Horsefair Surgery in Banbury, Oxfordshire – submitted five private prescriptions for insulin, needles and chemotherapy tablets to Cox and Robinson pharmacy in the town.

All items were charged at cost and the prescriptions were made out ‘for use in my practice’ – despite being intended for the cat. 

Insulin needles for animals can cost double those for humans, at around £13 for 100.

According to the General Medical Council (GMC) the medical treatment of animals is restricted to those registered with the Royal College of Veterinary Surgeons, so by writing a prescription for a cat, Dr Dawson was breaking the law.

Last month, Dr Dawson complained about GPs’ workloads in her local newspaper, saying: ‘GPs are bearing the brunt of trying to save NHS money ... We need better funding to recruit to reduce the intensity of our workloads.’

But a whistleblower said: ‘It’s outrageous. Perhaps this doctor’s workload would be less if she stuck to medicine and not veterinary practice.’ He said he became aware of the prescriptions because Dr Dawson ‘was very open about it and it was common knowledge’.

The whistleblower complained to the GMC, who admitted that Dr Dawson had broken the law – but decided against any further action.

The GMC is the main regulator for doctors, and ensures they meet good standards of medical practice.

When she initially found out about the complaint, Dr Dawson telephoned the GMC to tell them she had consulted with the vet, and justified the prescriptions by saying that vet’s bills were too expensive.

In its response to the complaint, the GMC admitted that the prescriptions were for a cat but said further investigation was not warranted.

It stated: ‘It is alleged that Dr Dawson prescribed inappropriately and irresponsibly in that she prescribed medication for her sister’s cat.

‘Dr Dawson [clarified] ... that she had first consulted with the vet and pharmacist before prescribing the medication. The prescriptions were made out “for use in my practice”.

‘By treating a cat Dr Dawson has transgressed the legal remit of veterinary practice. However we note Dr Dawson’s comment that she had talked to the vet and pharmacist and thus taken steps to ensure that the cat received appropriate medication.

‘Dr Dawson did write that the medication was for use in practice, which was not true. [However], the case examiners concluded that we do not need to take any action against her registration [as a GP]’.

Niall Dickson, chief executive of the GMC, said it did not normally comment unless action was taken on a case. 

However he added: ‘What we can say in general is that doctors have access to the whole range of medications and they must exercise that privilege responsibly. That does not include prescribing for animals.’

Mrs Wallace and Horsefair Surgery declined to comment.
