Four bronze angels which were built for Cardinal Wolsey's tomb but vanished into obscurity for nearly 500 years are being bought for the nation - at a price of £2.8million.

The opulent metre-high statues were made for Henry VIII's chief adviser in 1524 but disappeared after he fell out of the king's favour, at one point adorning the gateposts of a country manor.

Now the popularity of BBC drama Wolf Hall, based on Hilary Mantel's double Booker Prize-winning book series, has helped thrust the sculptures into the limelight - and raised £87,000 from the public.

Preserved: Originally designed for Cardinal Wolsey's tomb, these bronze angels will be preserved permanently in Victoria & Albert Museum in London after chiefs raised £2.8million to but them for the nation

Piece of history: Nearly £90,000 of the money came from the public, including the sale of 33,000 pin badges for £1 each in the museum shop. Wolsey fell out of favour with Henry VIII and his tomb was never finished

London's Victoria & Albert museum has raised £2.8million in all to acquire the works, led by a £2million grant from the National Heritage Memorial Fund.

The Art Fund contributed another £500,000, the Friends of the V&A gave £200,000 and of the public fundraising, £33,000 came from the sale of Save The Wolsey Angels badges in the museum shop.

V&A director Martin Roth said: 'The Wolsey Angels are a vital part of our national history and artistic heritage.

'We are very grateful to everyone who contributed to our fundraising appeal to ensure these outstanding sculptures, which were thought to be lost, are reunited and preserved at the V&A for future generations.'

Drama: The campaign was given a boost by Wolf Hall, in which Wolsey is played by Jonathan Pryce

Played by Jonathan Pryce in the BBC adaptation of Wolf Hall, Cardinal Thomas Wolsey amassed considerable power in the early 1500s as one of Henry VIII's closest confidantes.

But the pair fell out after the king's infamous attempt to annul his marriage with his first wife, Catherine of Aragon, because she had not produced a healthy son.

Cardinal Wolsey appealed for an annulment to Pope, based partly on the claim that Catherine was not a virgin when she married Henry - a claim she denied.

Caught in an international deadlock between Henry and Catherine's powerful nephew, the Holy Roman Emperor Charles V, the Pope delayed the decision and Wolsey was stripped of many of his offices in 1529.

He died just a year later mid-way through a journey to London, where he was due to face accusations of treason. 

Work on the angels had already started six years earlier in 1524, but the magnificent Renaissance-style tomb Wolsey had planned would never be erected.

The four bronzes were commissioned from the Florentine sculptor Benedetto da Rovezzano, who made them between 1524 and 1529.

Along with the rest of Wolsey's possessions and his planned tomb, the angels was appropriated by Henry VIII who intended to use them for himself.

Benedetto was commissioned to complete the tomb and he established himself at Westminster, where he employed founders and other craftsmen.

However, progress was halting and Henry VIII did not see the tomb finished.

Each of Henry VIII's three children expressed the intention to complete the memorial after he died, but they also failed to do so.

Elizabeth I moved the parts of the tomb to Windsor in 1565, where they stayed for 80 years until parts were sold to raise money during the Civil War.

Only a black stone chest - which now houses Lord Nelson's remains at St Paul's Cathedral - was known to have survived until two of the angels appeared at auction in 1994.

Unillustrated and catalogued only as 'in Italian Renaissance style', they were acquired by a Parisian art dealer and later the Italian scholar Francesco Caglioti attributed them to Benedetto.

The other two angels were discovered in 2008  at Great Harrowden Hall, Northamptonshire - where all four had once perched atop the country manor's magnificent gateposts. 

During the fundraising campaign, all four unevenly weathered angels were reunited for the first time since 1988 in the V&A's Medieval & Renaissance Galleries.

They remain there and will now stay in the museum, where they will be conserved and made to look as similar as they did in the day of Henry VIII.

New home: They will now be preserved for the nation at the Victoria & Albert Museum in central London

Fiona Talbott, head of the National Heritage Memorial Fund, said: 'Many of us have been enjoying the BBC's production of Wolf Hall, which makes it even more fitting to celebrate the purchase of these extraordinary statues.

'Congratulations to the V&A for being so tenacious in securing their future.

'We feel proud to have played a part too and hope that the Cardinal Wolsey's Angels - thanks to their current high profile - will attract many admirers both now and in the future.'
