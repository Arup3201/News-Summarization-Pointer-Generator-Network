The camera used to capture the most iconic image of the Second World War has turned up at a car boot sale in Wales, experts believe.

The emotive picture taken on June 6, 1944, has come to symbolise the D-Day landings, regularly appearing in newspapers and magazines even to this day.

A 1940s museum in West Wales thinks it may have stumbled across the very camera used by war journalist Jim Mapham to take the photo from Sword Beach in Normandy.

The image of battle-weary troops, described by the U.S. press as 'the greatest picture of the war', is now kept at the Imperial War Museum in London.

Investigations are underway to establish whether the standard-issue military camera, spotted on a table at the car boot sale in Carmarthenshire, was indeed the one that captured the image.

Efforts are being made to match up serial numbers held by the Imperial war Museum.

Officials at the museum say that, if authentic, the camera would be an 'important discovery'.

Documents sold with the camera confirm that it was sold in Leicester, where Mapham had lived and worked as a news reporter after the war.

Since then it has only had two other owners.

'It was buried with a load of junk at a car boot sale,' said cameraman and photographer Seimon Pugh Jones, director of Tin Shed Experience, a 1940s museum in Laugharne.

Mr Jonesâ€™s background in vintage and war photography sparked his interest in the item.

'I was at a stall at the United 
Counties Showground in Carmarthen chatting to a guy with some 
interesting bits and pieces,' he said.

Sergeant James Mapham, of the Army Film and Photographic Unit, took a series of pictures of the Normandy landings on June 6, 1944.

The most famous was 'Operation Overlord', which Mapham captured at 8.30am under intermittent enemy gunfire and shelling on on Queen Red Beach, Sword Area.

In the foreground of the picture taken near la Breche, Hermanville-sur-Mer, are sappers of 84 Field Company Royal Engineers, part of No.5 Beach Group.

Behind them, heavily laden medical orderlies of 8 Field Ambulance, Royal Army Medical Corps (some assisting wounded men) prepare to move off the beach.

In the background, weary men of the 1st Battalion, the Suffolk Regiment and the Lord Lovat's No. 4 Army Commando are landing on the beach.

The image is now filed away in the Photographic Archive of the Imperial War Museum in south London.

'He
happened to mention that he had a camera with some documentation and 
that it looked like the camera of a war photographer. We have a couple 
of models here in the museum so I bought it.'

Having
studied the papers, Mr Jones said: 'They show it is a standard issue 
camera for the British Army photographers and correspondents. With it is
a receipt which shows the camera was sold in photographic shop in 
Leicester in 1965.

'It looks like there have only ever been three owners before us, the second being a W Atkinson in Leicester.

'When we looked at it, we think it could very well have belonged to Mapham because the location and timing of sale fits.'

Mr
Jones and the team at the Tin Shed have bee in contact with the 
Leicester Mercury, the newspaper where Mapham later worked as a 
photographer, to find out more.The memorable photo was just one of numerous images from many rolls of film shot on June 6.

Mapham's lens captured the invasion from start to finish, from a panoramic shot 
of a moored fleet to his sunset shots of troops moving inland.

Mapham had been made Field Marshal Montgomery's official photographer and had also taken pictures of Winston Churchill.

After the invasion, he stuck to the front lines, breaking off to spend time documenting the French Resistance, where he was made an honorary member of the Maquis.

Having returned to his home in Leicester and work at the local daily paper, he died aged 59 at his cottage in Oadby in September 1968.

A spokeswoman from the Imperial War Museum said the find, if confirmed, could be a coup for the West Wales museum.

'In the context of Second World War photography, Jim Mapham is best remembered for his coverage of the British landings on Sword Beach during June 6, 1944,' she said.

Puzzle: Experts are trying to verify whether this is the same camera and efforts are being made to match up serial numbers held by the Imperial war Museum

'Arriving with Sherman tanks of the 13/18th Hussars as part of the initial assault wave, Mapham was in an ideal position to capture the start of the D-Day landings.

'His photographs take one through the dramatic events of June 6-7 from approaching Sword Beach under fire, through the drama of the landings to the initial push inland.

'Amongst the images captured by Mapham is one of the iconic photographs taken on D-Day showing British troops coming ashore whilst under German mortar and artillery fire. That medics are seen assisting men wounded whilst landing gives the photograph a real immediacy.

'From his original notes we can tell that Mapham used a camera with the serial number WD 51 in Normandy. If the camera discovered by the Tin Shed Museum turned out to be one and the same, it would be an important discovery.'

The Tin Shed Museum is now appealing for more information about Jim Mapham, and looking for any photos that may exist of Jim Mapham during the war holding the Super Ikonta B camera.
