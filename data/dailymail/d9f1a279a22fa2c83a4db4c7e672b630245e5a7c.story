A family of five killed in a horror Mother's Day crash on their way to Disneyland have been identified.

Little Cynthia Jimenez was bursting with excitement to celebrate her fifth birthday with her family at the Californian amusement park, but on the way there a delivery van en route to collect flowers for Mother's Day crashed into their car, crushing it.

The child, her mother, Angelica Garcia, 25, her father, Gerardo Jimenez, and her two brothers, Ivan, 2 and Freddie, 9, were all killed in the wreck, on Main Street in Hesperia, San Bernadino County.

On Monday, surviving family members were in shock, particularly the children's grandfather who drove by the wreck Sunday, but didn't know his family was involved in the crash.

He told NBC Los Angeles that he feels like his heart is destroyed.

The driver of the van - who is said to have swerved into the left-hand side and hit the Honda sedan, which was stationary at a stop sign - escaped with only minor injuries. He reportedly said he looked away for just a second before losing control of the van.

Relatives said earlier the family were on their way to Disneyland, which is a about a one hour and 20 minute drive away in Anaheim, according to CBS LA.

The full car was crushed by the van

The driver of the van, identified as Joshua Smith, 30, made it out with only minor injuries and was treated at the scene

The Cynthia would have been five on Monday.

'I've been to scenes where families have suffered great loss (but) all at once, in such a violent manner, is very rare,' sheriff’s Sgt. Doug Hubbard told KTLA.

The collision occurred just before 7a.m. at Main Street and Balsam Avenue in Hesperia, the San Bernardino Sheriff’s Department said.

Investigators determined that the van was traveling eastbound on Main Street when it went into westbound lanes, collided with a Honda sedan that was stopped at a stop sign, and landed on top of the car.

Lives cut short: Ivan, 2, pictured left, was only discovered dead in the car hours after the crash, while his brother Freddie, right, died at hospital

Horrific: It wasn't until after the van was removed from on top of the car that the body of the two-year-old boy was found

Crushed: The family were driving to Disneyland in Arnaheim for the day when the crash occurred. They were stopped at a stop sign

Tributes: A man lights candles by a cross erected by people in the area. Five candles were placed at the site to remember the family that was lost

Gerardo Jimenez and his son Freddie, 
9, made it out of the vehicle and were transported to hospital, but were
 later pronounced dead.

Angelica Garcia and Cynthia were trapped inside the car and pronounced dead at the scene.

Tragically,
 it wasn't until the van was lifted off the car, hours after the crash, 
that authorities found the body of two-year-old Ivan.

No arrests have been made, but the investigation is ongoing.
