At least 22 children died and many others were sick after eating a free school lunch that was tainted by a heavy dose of insecticide, officials in India said today.

It was not immediately clear how chemicals ended up in the food in a school in the eastern state of Bihar, although one official said the food may not have been properly washed before it was cooked.

The children, between the ages of 8 and 11, fell ill yesterday soon after eating their school lunch in Masrakh, a village 50 miles north of the state capital of Patna.

School authorities immediately stopped serving the meal of rice, lentils, soya and potatoes as the children started vomiting.

The lunch, part of a popular 
country-wide campaign to give at least one hot meal to children from 
poor families, was cooked in the school kitchen.

The children were quickly rushed to a local hospital and later to Patna for treatment, state official Abhijit Sinha said.

In addition to the 22 children who 
died, another 25 children as well as the school cook have been taken to 
hospital, he said. Eight of them were in a serious condition.

The deaths have sparked violent protests in Dharmasati Gandaman in the Saran district, where four police cars were set on fire during a demonstration by parents and hundreds of villagers.

Authorities suspended an official in 
charge of the free meal scheme in the school and registered a case of 
criminal negligence against the school headmaster, who fled as soon as 
the children fell ill.

P.K. Sahi, the state education 
minister, said a preliminary investigation suggested the food had traces
of an organophosphate used as an insecticide on rice and wheat crops.

It's believed the grain was not washed before it was served at the school, he said.

However, villagers said the problem 
appeared to be with a side dish of soya and potatoes, adding that 
children who had not eaten that dish were fine - although they had eaten
the rice and lentils.Â

India's midday meal scheme is one of the world's biggest school nutrition programs.

State governments have the freedom to 
decide on menus and timings of the meals depending on local conditions 
and availability of food rations.

It was first introduced in southern India, where it was seen as an incentive for poor parents to send their children to school.

Since then the program has been 
replicated across the country covering some 120million school children 
as part of an effort to address concerns about malnutrition.

According to the government, nearly half of all Indian children suffer from malnutrition.

Although there have been occasional 
complaints about the quality of the food served, or the lack of hygiene,
the tragedy in Bihar appeared to be the worst associated with the 
massive food program.

Bihar's top elected official, Chief Minister Nitish Kumar, has ordered an inquiry into the deaths.
