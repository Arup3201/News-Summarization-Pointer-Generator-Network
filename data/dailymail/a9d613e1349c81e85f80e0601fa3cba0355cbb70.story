Police probing the Jimmy Savile sex abuse scandal have arrested a man in his 60s on suspicion of sexual offences.

The man, from London, was arrested at 6.45am as part of Operation Yewtree, the investigation into allegations of sex abuse surrounding Savile and others. He has now been bailed until January, police said.

He is the seventh man arrested as part of the investigation and is now being questioned at a south London police station, Scotland Yard said.

They added: 'Officers working on Operation Yewtree have this morning, Monday 10 December, arrested a man in his 60s in connection with the investigation.

'The man from London was arrested at 06:45hrs on suspicion of sexual offences and has been taken into a south London police station.

'The individual falls under the strand of the investigation we have termed "Others".

'We are not prepared to discuss further.'

The force is leading the national probe into claims made against the disgraced TV presenter and figures in the entertainment industry. It is understood that up to 25 celebrities have been named to police as abusers.

A source with knowledge of the inquiry was yesterday quoted by the Sunday Times as saying: 'They all tend to be white men of the Savile generation'.

In some cases victims will not be identified or press charges. But in at least a dozen cases, police are reported to believe there is enough evidence for the celebrities to be detained.

The source added: 'We are halfway through'.

The investigation has three strands, one dealing with allegations directly involving Jimmy Savile, the second involving allegations against associates of the disgraced DJ and the third involving 'others'.

Operation Yewtree has already cost around Â£2million and involves a team of 30 officers.

Last week PR guru Max Clifford was arrested on suspicion of sexual offences but was later bailed as part of the probe.

A man aged in his 80s from Berkshire was interviewed by detectives two weeks ago.

Gary Glitter, comedian Freddie Starr, DJ Dave Lee Travis and a man in his 70s, reported to be former television producer Wilfred De'Ath, have been arrested and bailed as part of the probe.

Last month the force said it was dealing with around 450 potential victims, the vast majority of whom claimed they had fallen prey to Savile.

Officers are looking at three strands within their inquiry: claims against Savile, those against Savile and others, and those against others.
