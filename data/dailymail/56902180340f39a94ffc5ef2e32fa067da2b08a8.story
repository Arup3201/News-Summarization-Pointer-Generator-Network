A Labour councillor who campaigned with Harriet Harman is facing jail after he today admitted sending a '15-year-old schoolgirl' graphic online messages.

John Friary begged the man he thought was a teenager for racy pictures and arranged to meet 'her' for sex after she contacted him on the internet.

The 53-year-old thought he was exchanging explicit 
online chat with a teenager called 'Hannah' but was really the victim of a
scheming blackmailer who planned to extort money from him.

Labour campaigner: Councillor John Friary campaigned with Harriet Harman. He was facing jail after admitting attempting to groom the '15-year-old girl'

Friary, who was head of community safety at Southwark Council, has also canvassed with Tessa Jowell in elections.

The politician promised 'Hannah' he would be her 'father figure', 'look after' her and told her their chat was getting him 'turned on'.

He even agreed to pick 'Hannah' up from a tube station in central London and take her to his home in Camberwell, south London, for a night of passion.

But Friary was really exchanging the lurid emails with a plotting adult male who has since been jailed for blackmail.

He pleaded guilty today to attempting to arrange a meeting with a child following sexual grooming between January 10 and January 14 last year. 

Facing jail: John Friary, pictured arriving at court today, was remanded in custody ahead of his sentencing, for sending inappropriate messages to the 'schoolgirl'

Following his arrest he was sacked as the cabinet member responsible for community safety at Southwark Council and resigned as a councillor.

A judge at Isleworth Crown Court was told how on January 12 last year, 'Hannah' sent Friary an online chat message saying: 'Hi John, I am looking for a father figure as my real dad left home when I was five.

'I live with my mum and dad now, but I am looking for someone older I can have fun with. I am also a bit shy until I have had a couple of Bacardi Breezers.'

Friary replied: 'Hannah, I would love to be your father figure. You look so beautiful. Tell me about yourself, and what you are into sexually - you know what I like.'

Andrew Vout, prosecuting, told the court: 'This 53-year-old defendant came to be in email contact and online chat contact with an individual whom he believed to be a 15-year-old girl by the name of Hannah.

'In fact the individual that he communicated with was an adult male whose intention was in fact to blackmail him. The blackmailer has since been convicted of that offence and sentenced.

'In an email to 'Hannah' on January 9 the defendant introduced himself and very quickly is suggesting that they meet for sexual contact.'

In the messages read to the court he said he was excited by her - and described her as a 'gorgeous girl'.

He asked: 'Do you have any sexy pictures for me? Do you want me to be your dad?'

Friary believed 'Hannah' lived with her parents in Barnet, north London. 

He told her 'I bet you look hot naked' and added 'I can meet you anywhere and bring you back here'.

Before any attempt to extort money from Friary was made, the blackmailer was arrested.

Judge Phillip Matthews remanded Friary in custody while pre-sentencing reports are carried out.

Friary had represented Camberwell since 1994 but resigned following his arrest. He was also a governor at a Camberwell primary school.

He is due to be sentenced at Isleworth Crown Court on November 11.
