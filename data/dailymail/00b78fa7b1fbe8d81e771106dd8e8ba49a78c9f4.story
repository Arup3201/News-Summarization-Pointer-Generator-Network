The owner of a ferocious dog that mauled a woman to death after being kept in a tiny cage walked free from court after a judge said his actions did not deserve a jail term.

Alex Blackburn-Smith, 34, admitted failing to ensure the welfare of his two-and-a-half-year-old Neapolitan mastiff Debo - likened to a hound from the Harry Potter films - but was told his behaviour had not 'passed the custody threshold'.

The former paratrooper kept the eight-stone beast cooped up in close quarters in the weeks before it mauled 52-year-old Barbara Williams, Croydon Magistrates' Court heard.

She died after she was savaged by the animal at Blackburn-Smith's home in Wallington, Surrey on December 23, 2010.

He was originally arrested on suspicion of manslaughter but later admitted failing to ensure the welfare of the animal.

Blackburn-Smith kept Debo in a cage that was too small, which could have caused the dog to become violent, the court was told yesterday.

But RSPCA officers and a police community support officer failed to notice this when they visited Blackburn-Smith's home regarding a separate noise complaint prior to the attack on Ms Williams.

Debo, described as 'ferocious' and 'distinctly large' by police, was shot dead by armed marksmen, who contained the snarling animal using riot shields after the attack.

Blackburn-Smith also admitted being in possession of a fighting dog after police also seized a cross/pitbull puppy called Ruby.

At the time of the attack, three other people and a child were also living in the property, the court heard.

Police were called to Blackburn-Smith's home at 8.57pm on December 23, said Angela Williams, prosecuting.

'They discovered a female with severe injuries lying in the hallway. She was subsequently pronounced dead at the scene,' she said.

'The Neapolitan mastiff was located, isolated and destroyed.

'The pitbull puppy was also seized.'

One witness told how Ms Williams and another woman were upstairs watching TV then went to the kitchen, where the two dogs were kept in cages.

Debo was heard to growl then told to be quiet, the court heard, but the dog managed to force the cage open and attack the victim.

Richard Jeffries, defending, said: 'It's clear the two charges relate to different dogs. Ruby was Debo's daughter.

'No one knows what set Debo off, police carried out an inquiry and the defendant was initially arrested on suspicion of manslaughter.'

It was only after a full inquiry that he was charged with the two offences for which he appeared in court.

Mr Jeffries said: 'Keeping Debo in the cage may have been a contributing factor.

'Debo was bought as a family pet and was the same style of dog as you might see in the Harry Potter films.

The lawyer defending Blackburn-Smith likened Debo to Fang - Hagrid's dog in the Harry Potter Films - pictured with actor Robbie Coltrane

'Barbara Williams was more than a lodger, she was perceived as an auntie.

'Nothing I say can diminish the tragedy that occurred and that is something my client has to live with every day.'

Blackburn-Smith was banned from owning any animal and having anything to do with keeping or transporting animals at an earlier hearing.

Today he was handed a community order and told to carry out 150 hours' unpaid work.

He was also ordered to pay Â£3340 court costs - half the total sum - due to him being unemployed and on benefits.

District Judge Robert Hunter told him: 'We don't know what the direct cause of the attack was.

'I give you a degree of credit for your guilty plea, albeit at a late stage.

'I can't say this matter has passed the custody threshold so I sentence you to a community order and 150 hours' unpaid work.'
