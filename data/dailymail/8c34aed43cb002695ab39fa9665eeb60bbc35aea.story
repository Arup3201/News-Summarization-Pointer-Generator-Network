Comedy Central has announced Stephen Colbert’s replacement.

Larry Wilmore, currently of ‘The Daily Show with Jon Stewart,’ will replace the ‘Colbert Report’ host when he jumps ship next year to replace David Letterman as host of ‘The Late Show.’

The 11.30 p.m. Monday to Thursday show following Stewart will be called ‘The Minority Report with Larry Wilmore,’ according to Variety. It will launch in January.

He finally has his own show: Larry Wilmore has been tabbed to replace Stephen Colbert starting next year

‘I’m beyond excited to have this chance to continue my relationships with Comedy Central and the brilliant Jon Stewart,’ Wilmore said in a statement. ‘I love the city of New York and promise to only wear my Laker T-shirts when I’m layering.’

‘While Larry Wilmore is a brilliant comic and showrunner, this is all just a complicated ruse to get him to move to New York and turn him into a Knicks fan,’ Stewart added.

The 52-year-old Los Angeles native currently serves as the ‘Senior Black Correspondent’ on the ‘Daily Show.’

‘Minority Report’ will have a different format than either the ‘Colbert Report’ or Stewart’s show.It will feature Wilmore hosting a rotating cadre of comedians and other celebrities, according to the network.

‘The series will feature a diverse panel of voices currently underrepresented in comedy and television.’

Wilmore is a show business veteran who has an Emmy Award to his name and has written for several shows including ‘In Living Color,’ ‘The Fresh Prince of Bel Air,’ The Office’ and others.He also co-created ‘The Bernie Mac Show.’

Wilmore was also recently listed as a showrunner for the recently-greenlit ABC comedy ‘Black-ish’ starring Anthony Anderson, according to Variety.

He is expected to stay with the show until taking over the reins at ‘Minority Report’ next year.Colbert’s ‘Late Show’ debut is expected in the spring of 2015.
