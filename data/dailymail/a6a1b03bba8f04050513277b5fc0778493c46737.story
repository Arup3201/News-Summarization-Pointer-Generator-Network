The pressure of being related to the Vice President has made Joe Biden's niece Caroline 'unravel', a report has claimed.

Miss Biden, 26, was detained by police this week after getting into a fight with her roommate, and was pictured being carried away by officers while hiding under a towel.

But now her 'friend' socialite Paul Johnson Calderon has told the New York Post she has a pill and drink addiction caused by the pressure of being related to the Vice President.

Caroline Biden was allegedly charged with disorderly conduct and obstructing governmental administration

He said he wasn't surprised when he heard about police being called to her luxury Tribeca apartment on Tuesday morning.

'The pressure of being Joe Biden’s niece made her totally unravel. it’s a desire for attention, a cry for help,' Mr Calderon said.

He described the Georgetown University graduate as a 'hot mess' and likened her to actress Amanda Bynes.

'She’s surrounded by a lot of people who
use her because of who she is. Guys would want to date her because of 
who her ­uncle is,' Mr Calderon told the Post from a sober-living facility.

He added that he ended their friendship because he is dealing with an alcohol addiction.

Miss Biden, who works at Higher Pictures gallery in New York, also went to rehab for alcohol and Adderall addiction while at university, another friend claimed.

Her father paid the deposit for the luxury apartment she was renting from NYU student Anne Marie Yacopetti.

Avoiding a spectacle: Caroline Biden was wrapped in a bedsheet when she was transported from the Tribeca police precinct to the awaiting ambulance on Tuesday morning

Questions remain: Police officials confirmed to MailOnline that she was transported to Beth Israel hospital but they did not have any information about what caused her to seek medical treatment following her fight with a roommate

Miss Yacopetti's mother claimed the gallery 
worker would pay the rent she owed, 'when she feels like it' and added: 
'If you’re an elitist Biden, I guess you think you’re owed the world.'

It
is not the first time Miss Biden has come into contact with law 
officials. In 2009 she was briefly detained by Amtrak police over a 
disputed train fare.

At
the time she claimed she was treated unfairly because of her family's 
connection to the Vice President, and said she had intended to pay for 
her ticket on the train, a friend said. 

Police sources have confirmed to MailOnline that Miss Biden was charged with resisting arrest, harassment, and obstructing government administration on Tuesday.

The
harassment charge stem from the fight with her unidentified roommate, 
while The Wall Street Journal reports that the charge of obstructing 
government administration comes after allegedly taking a swing at an officer.

She was given a desk appearance ticket and has to 
return to plea her case on October 29.

Connections: Caroline is the daughter of Vice President Joe Biden's older brother James

Family ties: Caroline's father is Joe's brother James (seen at left with the vice President in 2008, and at right with his wife Sara Biden at the White House in 2011)

After
she was placed in handcuffs, brought to the Tribeca police precinct and
released following the desk appearance ticket, she was then taken to 
Beth Israel Hospital for undisclosed reasons.

Police were called to Miss Biden's Desbrosses Street apartment around 8am over a heated argument she was having with her roommate.

Miss Biden allegedly got physical when a female officer tried to intervene, Metro US reported.

She had reportedly been arguing with her
roommate about rent. She was arraigned in Manhattan Criminal Court 
early Tuesday afternoon.

The Vice President's office has not commented on Miss Biden's arrest.
