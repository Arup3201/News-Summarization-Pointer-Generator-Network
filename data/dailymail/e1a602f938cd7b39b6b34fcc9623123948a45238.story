Tom Ince has moved a step closer to following in his father’s footsteps after Inter Milan set up contract talks with him in London.

Inter president Erick Thohir confirmed he was heading to England, and Sportsmail understands he will hold talks with 22-year-old Ince’s agent during his stay in London.

The England Under 21 forward would cost Inter as little as £155,000 in compensation after he ran down his contract at Blackpool.

Meanwhile, the San Siro club have distanced themselves from reports linking them with Patrice Evra.

Claims over the weekend suggested the Italian side had drawn up a contract offer for the Manchester United left back.
