Louis van Gaal will have to find a cure for Manchester United's travel sickness if his side are going to win their battle to claim a Champions League spot ahead of either Arsenal or Liverpool.

Manchester United appointed Van Gaal to repair the damage caused by their disastrous 2013-14 campaign under David Moyes.

However the Dutchman's first season at the helm of the Barclays Premier League outfit has not exactly gone to plan.

Louis van Gaal's Manchester United laboured to a 1-0 win against Newcastle on Wednesday evening 

Ashley Young scored in the 89th minute to give his side a crucial win in their race for a top four spot

Manchester United's away form has been nothing short of average with Van Gaal's side collecting maximum points on just four of their 14 away trips.

The Red Devils need to win two more games from their last six away matches to avoid a new club record low in the Premier League.

Their worst season away from Old Trafford came in the 2010-11 season when Sir Alex Ferguson's then side claimed just 25 points from 19 away matches.

Manchester United managed to win the title in 2011 despite their poor away form as they won 18 of their 19 home league games.

Van Gaal's away record is remarkably worse than Moyes' win percentage on the road as the Scotsman guided his side to 10 wins out of a possible 18 during his short stint at the club.

Moyes' away win percentage at Manchester United was 55.56 per cent, which looks impressive when compared to Van Gaal's 28.57.

And Van Gaal's side, who claimed a late 1-0 win against Newcastle at St James' Park on Wednesday, are yet to face rivals Liverpool and  Premier League leaders Chelsea at Anfield and Stamford Bridge respectively.
