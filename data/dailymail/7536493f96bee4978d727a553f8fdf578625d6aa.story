Alcohol isn’t the only substance that could get you in trouble behind the wheel — your medication could put you over the limit, too.

A Department for Transport study found drug driving (due to legal or illegal drugs) was responsible for up to 200 fatal accidents every year.

From next month, new legislation will set limits for certain prescription medicines, such as the painkiller morphine, and drugs for anxiety or insomnia, such as diazepam, clonazepam, oxazepam and temazepam. 

Experts warn that many motorists are not aware that seemingly innocent over-the-counter drugs such as hay fever remedies can also have an effect on driving and get you into trouble with the law

It’s already illegal to drive if your reactions are impaired by medication — the new law is designed to bring drug driving into line with drink driving, with clear limits on prescription medications.

Experts warn that many motorists are not aware that seemingly innocent over-the-counter drugs such as hay fever remedies can also have an effect on driving and get you into trouble with the law.

‘Many forms of medication make it clear on the label that when taken they can impair your ability to drive,’ says solicitor Paul Reddy, of firm Slater & Gordon. 

‘Just because they are legal and widely available, if taking them affects your driving you could end up with points, a fine, disqualification from driving or even worse if you have an accident.’

Here, we examine the common medicines — over-the-counter and prescription — which could have an influence on you behind the wheel . . .

BLOOD PRESSURE

Drugs such as the ACE inhibitor ramipril can make you feel dizzy. As blood pressure drops, the brain may receive less blood, causing light-headedness.

‘If it happens, it’s likely to be within a couple of hours of taking the drug, so avoid driving then,’ says Dr Nigel Durham, a consultant cardiologist at York Hospital.

Take these drugs at night to be extra careful, and if the problem persists, see your GP.

UPSET TUMMY

Over-the-counter medicines to treat diarrhoea may cause drowsiness as a side-effect. 

This is linked to the ingredient loperamide — found in products such as Imodium — which slows down the digestive process.

HAY FEVER

Some hay fever treatments can make you feel drowsy, though this is less common with newer types of antihistamines.

‘Anti-allergy drugs are divided into sedating and non-sedating medication,’ says Dr Jude Gunasekera, a Manchester GP.

‘If you’re taking a sedating medication, allow at least two to three hours before driving.’

Otherwise, use treatments that work on symptoms locally, such as eye drops.

COLDS AND FLU

Nearly one in seven motorists who has taken cold or flu medication containing codeine has suffered side-effects, such as lethargy, behind the wheel, according to a 2014 survey by the Royal Pharmaceutical Society.

Codeine, a painkiller, can slow reaction times and has been linked to low concentration levels and blurry eyesight.

Remedies such as Night Nurse contain antihistamine, which can cause drowsiness, says Professor Ron Eccles, director of Cardiff University’s Common Cold Centre.

‘I wouldn’t drive for at least six hours after taking one of these preparations,’ he says.

NERVE PAIN

The anti-depressant amitriptyline is routinely prescribed for chronic pain, such as severe arthritis or a trapped nerve.

However, the drug can affect nerve receptors in the eye, causing blurred vision, so should be taken before you go to bed, says Dr Gunasekera.

INDIGESTION

Antacids containing magnesium can cause severe diarrhoea (understandably, this can make driving difficult) if you exceed the recommended dose — easy to do when it’s in liquid form, says Dr Anton Emmanuel, consultant gastroenterologist at University College Hospital, London.

INSOMNIA

Sleeping pills — including over-the-counter remedies such as Nytol, whose main ingredient is an antihistamine — can have a hangover effect the next day, as it can take this long for the liver to expel the drugs from the body.

Elderly people are particularly sensitive, so may feel sedated for longer.

‘They also prevent you going into a deep, “slow-wave” sleep during the night, so you may not feel refreshed in the morning,’ says Russell Foster, professor of circadian neuroscience at Oxford University.

‘Avoid sleeping pills if you have a long drive the following day.’

DEPRESSION

Taking antidepressants may make you more prone to accidents as the chemical changes in the brain that improve mood may also slow reaction times.

In 2012, research at the University of Taiwan found those taking selective serotonin reuptake inhibitors (SSRIs), a group of antidepressants including Prozac and Seroxat, were 72 per cent more at risk than people who were not on medication.

HEADACHES

Triptans, taken for migraine, work by acting on the blood vessels to block the pain-triggering action of nerves.

But they can leave you feeling tired, says Dr Andrew Dowson, director of headache services at King’s College Hospital, London.

‘It’s unclear whether it’s the drug or the fact it takes away the headache pain associated with migraine, so other symptoms, such as feeling spaced out, appear more acute.’

 

THE PAINKILLER DANGER ZONE

Strong prescription painkillers such as tramadol — for conditions including chronic lower back pain — can make you drowsy, says Dr Aditi Ghei, consultant anaesthetist at Watford General Hospital.

Tramadol mimics endorphins — naturally pain-reducing chemicals in the brain.

‘It’s possible to build up a tolerance, so you may need more for it to take effect, which could have a greater impact on driving,’ says Dr Ghei.

‘If you’ve just been prescribed tramadol, don’t drive for two to three days at any dosage, so you can check its effects on you.’
