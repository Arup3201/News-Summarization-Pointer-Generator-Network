A couple who had been married for 60 years died within 72 hours of each other after the husband was mugged by two drug addicts as he sat on his mobility scooter. 

Kenneth Duxbury, an Army veteran, was attacked and robbed  while on his way to pay a bill last August. 

The following day, after hearing of Mr Duxbury's ordeal, his wife Iris, 79, suffered a stroke and later died in hospital.

The day after his beloved wife's death, the great-grandfather, 82, fell ill. He died 48 hours later.

Career criminals Stephen McLeish, 33, and John Carroll, 36, both of Blackburn, Lancashire, were jailed for three years for the attack at Preston Crown Court yesterday.

They were branded the 'scum of the earth' by Mr and Mrs Duxbury's family.

Preston Crown Court was told Mr Duxbury  had been diagnosed with cancer and was confined to a wheelchair but was able to live an 'independent' life with his wife in an assisted living property.

Mr Duxbury was cornered on August 29 last year, just moments after kissing his wife goodbye.

He was targeted by McLeish and Carrol after they spotted him while picking up methadone from a chemist. They approached him as he passed under a railway bridge on his 5mph mobility scooter.   

Prosecutor Miss Emma Keogh said: 'Although it was the middle of the morning, the railway bridge was much darker than the main street and there is no CCTV.

'Mr Duxbury became aware of a man stood in front of him, blocking his path. He stopped Mr Duxbury and said, "have you got the time?". 

'Mr Duxbury said, "no sorry I don't have the time". He tried to get past the man and tried to put the scooter between the man and the lamppost.

'But the man said, "where's your money?" and his arm was grabbed and pulled up by the side of him. He was aware there were two men and they were searching his pockets. He said: "You are not getting it" as realised they were after his wallet. 

Not content with taking his wallet, they also went in his pocket trying to look for change. One said, 'come on let's go' and they ran off.'

Mr Duxbury made his way home to his wife and called the police with a description of his attackers. 

But the following morning Iris, a former cotton mill worker, was taken to hospital after suffering a stroke. She died on 12 September.

Mr Duxbury gave a statement to police in which he said: '£250 is a lot of money to somebody like me. This is a cowardly and despicable crime to rob a pensioner in a mobility scooter.' 

On September 13 he was rushed into hospital when a viral infection which had collected around his tumour worsened and he died two days later.

Police tracked down the two men after Mr Duxbury identified them from CCTV images taken at the chemist in the run up to his death.

Miss Keogh added: 'Whilst in the chemist taking methadone, they come out and become aware of Mr Duxbury in his wheelchair.

'At that point there must have been a discussion about what they were going to do. There must be an element of pre-planning.

'He was clearly vulnerable by his disability. This offence is tragic in that the day after the offence Mr Duxbury's wife had a stroke and was taken into hospital and died. 

'But even more tragic is that days after the offence Mr Duxbury died too.'

Carroll had a number of theft and drug offences and a robbery conviction in 1999 for which he spent 18 months behind bars whilst McLeish had a record for dishonesty matters, burglary and shoplifting as well as GBH in 2002 for which he went to jail for four years.

In mitigation for Carroll, defence counsel Anthony Parkinson said: 'He makes comment to the fact that this incident will not leave him on being released from prison.

'It is something he will have to live with for the remainder of his life. He also describes how it not only affects him but his immediate family. 

'Everyone knows about the offence. He has suffered from a long standing drug addiction. He has misused heroin and diazepam.'

Mr Adrian Williams, for McLeish, said: 'They were in a cycle at the time. A downward spiral and my submission is that they took the opportunity that presented to them and in Mr McLeish's own words, 'a desperate, disgusting, impulsive act'.

Passing sentence the judge Mr Recorder Terence Rigby said: 'You are two very wretched men who lived a very wretched life with drink and drugs. 

'There is no point me lecturing you and I can't do better than the description of Mr Duxbury of the crime, it was cowardly and despicable.

'You did not know he was dying from cancer but you did know he was disabled, only getting around in a disability scooter, no one to help him, no one to protect him and you robbed him. 

'The normal guidance is up to three years but it's clear to me that this is not long enough.'

After the case Mr and Mrs Duxbury's son Stephen Duxbury, 57, a security officer said: 'These two are nothing but the scum of earth and I feel angry towards them. 

'I hope they are remorseful and they don't do it again but that's about as much as I can hope for. You hope it will make them think twice about doing it again but it probably won't.

'Losing one parent is bad enough but two in the space of three days is heartbreaking. There is no way of knowing if what these lads did had an effect on them - but it can't have helped.

'Dad was effectively dying anyway but that does not lessen the disgusting way these two men treated him. 

'He had got the scooter so he could keep up his independence and had bought this chair so it could help him stand up. All he was doing was paying a bill and it happened literally around the corner from home.

'Dad was used to taking care of himself but must have felt very intimidated. He said if it wasn't for his muscle wastage he would have clocked them.

'No one should suffer something like that, whether an old age pensioner or not. Mum and Dad were very close and they did everything together. 

'It must have knocked mum for six when she heard about the mugging and I think when she passed away a little part of my dad gave up. '
