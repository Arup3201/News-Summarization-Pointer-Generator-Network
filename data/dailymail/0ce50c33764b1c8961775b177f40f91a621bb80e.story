Nasa's Curiosity rover has developed a major computer problem on Mars.

Engineers have been forced to suspend the rover's work while they attempt to restore a corrupted computer.

The team said the rover had been placed in a 'safe mode' to protect it.

The intentional swap put the rover, as anticipated, into what what engineers said was a minimal-activity precautionary status called 'safe mode.'

The team is shifting the rover from safe mode to operational status over the next few days and is troubleshooting the condition that affected operations yesterday, Nasa said.

The condition is related to a glitch in flash memory linked to the other, now-inactive, computer.

'We switched computers to get to a standard state from which to begin restoring routine operations,' said Richard Cook of NASA's Jet Propulsion Laboratory, project manager for the Mars Science Laboratory Project, which built and operates Curiosity.

A Picasso-like self portrait of NASA's Curiosity rover was taken by its Navigation cameras, located on the now-upright mast.

Curiosity carries a pair of redundant main computers in order to have a backup available if one fails. Each of the computers, A-side and B-side, also has other redundant subsystems linked to just that computer.

Curiosity is now operating on its B-side, as it did during part of the flight from Earth to Mars. It operated on its A-side from before the August 2012 landing through Wednesday.

'While we are resuming operations on the B-side, we are also working to determine the best way to restore the A-side as a viable backup,' said JPL engineer Magdy Bareh, leader of the mission's anomaly resolution team.

The spacecraft remained in communications at all scheduled communication windows on Wednesday, but it did not send recorded data, only current status information.

The status information revealed that the computer had not switched to the usual daily 'sleep' mode when planned.

Diagnostic work in a testing simulation at JPL indicates the situation involved corrupted memory at an A-side memory location used for addressing memory files.

Scientific investigations by the rover have been suspended.

Resumption of science investigations is anticipated within several days,' said Nasa.

Earlier this week, laboratory instruments inside the rover have been analyzing portions of the first sample of rock powder ever collected from the interior of a rock on Mars.
