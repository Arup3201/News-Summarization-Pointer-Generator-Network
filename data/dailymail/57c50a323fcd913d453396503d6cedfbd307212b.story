The world's first zoo-born male orangutan to be released into the wild has been killed by a poisonous snake after just 17 months in the jungle.

Seven-year-old Semeru made history in 2011 when Perth Zoo in Western Australia decided he had the right temperament to be released into his natural rain forest habitat in Indonesia.

But park rangers on the island of Sumatra were horrified to find his body in the jungle, where he had easily adapted to his surroundings.

Poisoned: The seven-year-old orangutan became the first zoo-born male to be released into the wild in 2011

However an investigation has now begun into whether his background of being born and raised for six years in a zoo left him without the basic instincts needed to protect himself from the dangers of the jungle.

'We have been keeping track of Semeru ever since he was released into a protected part of the rainforest and he seemed to be doing well,' said a spokesman for Indonesia's orang-utan rehabilitation department.

'We found a snake bite and tests have since proved he died from toxic poisoning.'

His death might also have been due to what zoo officials said was his independent and curious nature.Â

Whether his curiosity had led to him approaching and perhaps trying to handle a toxic snake is a question that no-one will be able to answer.

A spokeswoman for Perth Zoo said: 'All the staff are devastated at this loss, but we're glad that Semeru was able to spend part of his life in the wild.'

Semeru was transported from Perth Zoo in October 2011 to Bukit Tigapuluh in Sumatra as part of the Sumatran orang-utan re-introduction programme to establish a new population of the crtically-endangered species in the wild.

He was born at Perth Zoo in June 2005 to mother Sekara and father Dinara.

Zoo officials said Sekara was an excellent first-time mother and doted on Semeru, the first of the third generation of orang-utans born at the zoo.

He was chosen for the release programme because of his age and temperament.

Officials said he had reached the natural age of dispersal for a male orang-utan and was confident, curious and independent.

The world's first female orang-utan to be released into the wild was Temara, who was also born at Perth Zoo.

She was released in the same area as Semeru in 2006 and is said to have adapted well to her surroundings.

Indonesia has four extremely dangerous snakes, the venom of which can bring about death in an hour or so.

They include: the banded krait, the bite of which causes muscle weakness, loss of co-ordination and eventually respiratory paralysis. Victims have only a 50 per cent chance of surviving.

The black spitting cobra and the king cobra, the bite of both causing pain, muscle weakness and respiratory paralysis.

The pit viper, which causes great pain, bleeding and tissue damage, and the tree snake, which also causes death through paralysis of heart and lungs.
