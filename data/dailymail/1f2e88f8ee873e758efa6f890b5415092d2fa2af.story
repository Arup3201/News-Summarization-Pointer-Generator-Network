A fugitive cagefighter who is addicted to bodybuilding is now being hunted by police over allegations of rape more than five months after he went on the run.

Mixed martial arts fanatic Lloyd Seddon, 23, vanished last October while on early parole from a five-year jail term for an armed robbery spree.

Seddon allegedly raped a woman near his home in Salford, Greater Manchester in February, but  police have been unable to find him since he failed to show up for a November court hearing after he was charged with assault and affray in connection with a bar brawl.

Today Greater Manchester Police confirmed Seddon is wanted in connection with rape, re-call to prison and failing to appear at court in Blackpool and issued the images of him.

They issued new photos of the tattooed suspect who is said to be addicted to bodybuilding and weight lifting sessions.

Officers believe he will be unable to resist the temptation to visit the gym and are hoping fellow keep fit fanatics recognise him due to a distinctive samurai warrior tattoo on his right forearm and will turn him in.

Seddon who regularly visits Blackpool, Lancashire, regularly posts selfie pictures of himself on Facebook flexing his muscles and showing off his torso.

The last picture posted on October 12 last year showed Seddon lining up alcohol shots on a bar accompanied by the caption: 'Ready to rip Blackpool up for second time.'

'I would now ask that if you see this man anywhere, whether that's in the street or training next to you in the gym, then pick up the phone and call us, said Inspector Dave Henthorne, of Greater Manchester Police

Greater Manchester Police said today in an appeal: 'Lloyd Seddon has a history of violence and is not to be approached. However, Seddon is a fitness fanatic who takes part in cage-fighting and mixed martial arts and officers believe he will be unable to resist the temptation to visit the gym.

'He is also currently being sought in connection with the rape of a woman in Salford on 19 February 2014.

'Seddon has links in the Salford area but could be anywhere in the North West or Midlands.

'Seddon’s details were released by GMP in November 2013 but the wanted appeal failed to help locate him.

Inspector Dave Henthorne, of Greater Manchester Police said: 'Seddon has a history of violence so is not to be directly approached'.

'However, as you can see from the photograph he has an easily identifiable tattoo of a samurai warrior on his right forearm which, once you've seen, will not be forgotten. We are confident that Seddon would not have been able to resist visiting gyms and continuing to train for his various martial arts hobbies.

'I would now ask that if you see this man anywhere, whether that's in the street or training next to you in the gym, then pick up the phone and call us.'

Seddon, from Lower Broughton, Salford was originally jailed in June 2009 after a robbery rampage the previous March which began when four men burst into a house armed with an armed with an axe, a wheel brace and a metal bar

Seddon, from Lower Broughton, Salford was orginally jailed in June 2009 after a robbery rampage the previous March which began when four men burst into a house armed with an armed with an axe, a wheel brace and a metal bar.

The axe was swung at one of the occupants narrowly missing her whilst she was on the phone to her boyfriend. The phone was then smashed up with the axe.

The group demanded keys to a Volkswagen Golf parked outside befire fleeing a Mazda R8 stolen earlier from a house.

The gang then robbed a BMW Three Series, having threatened another victim with an axe.

As they drove off with the previously stolen Mazda, police noticed the cars being driven erratically and tried to stop them.

Officers pursued the cars at speeds reaching 130mph.

The Mazda went onto the wrong side of the road before it was dumped. Seddon who was a passenger in the car was arrested after being chased on foot by officers.

He later pleaded guilty to robbery, possession of a controlled drug, aggravated burglary and aggravated taking of a vehicle without the owner’s consent.

He was also disqualified from driving for 12 months

An accomplice then aged 17 was also locked away for five years after pleaded guilty to robbery, aggravated burglary, dangerous driving, driving while disqualified, driving without insurance, aggravated taking of a vehicle without the owner’s consent and asked for six other offences of burglary to be taken into consideration.

At the time police said Seddon had been an 'adrenaline-fuelled' crime spree with his 'reckless actions' putting the lives of terrified people in danger.

But he was released early from his stretch and last October was due to face magistrates in Blackpool on a court summons.

He failed to show up for the hearing and the following month a police appeal was issued saying he was wanted for recall to jail.

Officers failed to locate him and now a woman has claimed she was raped by Seddon on February 19.

No further details are known about the allegation.

Police said Seddon has links in the Salford area but could be anywhere in the North West or Midlands.

Anyone with information should phone police on 101 or the independent charity Crimestoppers, anonymously, on 0800 555 111.
