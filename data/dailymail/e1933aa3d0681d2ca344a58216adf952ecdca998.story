In trouble: Attorney James Owen faces losing his license for an affair with the wife of a client

An Ohio attorney is fighting to keep his license after admitting to having an affair with his client's wife before, during and after the trial that found him guilty of murder.

At a disciplinary hearing on Tuesday, James D. Owen said his affair with Celeste Caulley at the time of the 1997 trial was a 'betrayal of trust' and went against 'every principle' he stood for.

He admitted that he even had sex with Caulley the night her husband Robert was convicted of murdering his parents, Lois and Charles. He was later sentenced to 25 years to life in prison.

Owen, 59, insisted that he had fought hard for his client, but when he finally admitted to the affair years later, a judge called for a new trial, ruling that the attorney had been 'distracted'.

The lawyer ended the relationship in 1998 and then told his wife, son, parents and in-laws. Court documents said that the affair finished when he refused to leave his wife.

He then waited 14 years before telling 
anyone else about the affair, which involved him having sex with Caulley in his office, at hotels and in a cabin, the Columbus Dispatch reported.

'I 
couldn't bring myself to do it,' he told the Ohio Supreme Court Board of Commissioners on Grievances and Discipline. 'I felt like I had fallen off a cliff 
into a deep hole and didn't know how to get out of it.'

Violation of trust: Owen, right, shakes hands with Robert Caulley in 1997, when he was convicted of killing his parents in 1994. He has been granted a re-trial since it emerged Owen was having an affair with his wife

He has been a practicing attorney for 34 years but he could lose his 
law license or have it suspended if he is found guilty of violating 
noncriminal rules of professional conduct.

The
 panel will report its findings to the full board, which will then make a
 recommendation to the Supreme Court. A final ruling is not likely until
 early next year, the Dispatch reported.

After the affair was uncovered in 2011, 
Ohio Public Defender Tim Young was granted a new trial for Caulley based
 on Owenâ€™s improper relationship with his wife.

'He had been distracted to an extent 
that greatly hindered his preparation and trial performance,' Judge John
 Martin said, agreeing to a new trial. 'Counsel spent inordinate amounts of time with Celeste and shunned the rest of his investigators and 
assistants, leading to mistakes.'

Robert Caulley, a former auronatical engineer, maintains he had nothing to do with death of his parents, who were found stabbed to death after a botched robbery in 1994, and claims that he was coerced into giving a confession.

Torn: Celeste Caulley reacts to his guilty plea in 1997 - but she went on to have sex with his lawyer in a hotel that night. She has now said that she believes her former husband was innocent

His DNA was never found on the murder weapon. His wife, who has now remarried, said she also believes he is innocent.

'Bob deserved so much better than the 
representation he received, and I will forever feel guilty about my part
 in the affair and how it impacted Jim Owen's work on Bob's case,' she told the Dispatch.

'Even though Bob and I are no longer married, I have always known he is innocent, and I am committed to seeing him freed.'

One of Caulley's attorneys, Assistant Public Defender Kim Rigby, said the judge's decision for a new trial effectively overturns his convictions.

'The court has rightfully recognized that attorney Owen was acting under an egregious conflict of interest and neglected his work on Caulley's case, a case that was clearly not a slam-dunk for the prosecution,' she said.
