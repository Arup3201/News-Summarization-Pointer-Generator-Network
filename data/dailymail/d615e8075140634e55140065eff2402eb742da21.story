Saab will start making cars again, two years after going to the wall.

The Swedish firm will make existing models, such as the 9-3 saloon, but also start producing electric cars.

It went bankrupt in late 2011 and was bought by a Chinese-Swedish investment group, National Electric Vehicle Sweden, in June 2012.

Saab is to reproduce its 9 x 3 Turbo Saloon in the first batch of vehicles to be made since the company was bought in 2012

Spokesman Mikael Oestlund said initial production levels at its factory in western Sweden will be ‘modest’ and rise if demand grows.

The company is to make a petrol-powered version of the car with the aim of launching an electric version later.

Mr Oestlund said: 'You can’t change or develop very much in
 a year. We acquired the assets in August last year.

'Our focus has been 
to get the co-operation up and running with 400 suppliers and ensure the
 facilities were working.'

'We are humble and say we’ll start 
the production volume with low figures and be able to increase over time
 according to the market’s demand.’

Sales peaked at 133,000 cars in 2006 but slumped to 27,000 only three years later.

US car giant General Motors (GM) – which also owns Britain’s Vauxhall - bought a 50per cent stake and management control of the firm in 1989, before gaining full ownership in 2000 – though bosses admitted they never knew quite what to do with it.

At the Detroit Motor Show in January 2008, General Motors  senior executive Bob Lutz told the Daily Mail ahead of his company’s eventual sale of the Swedish car firm: ‘Saab is the GM executive wife’s vehicle of choice .

'But I don’t think it has ever made a profit in its entire history. We’ve hung onto it longer than we should have.’

American parent firm GM itself sought bankruptcy protection as the global financial crisis unfolded, forcing the US company to dispose of assets.

So GM sold Saab to Dutch group Spyker, which in turn eventually sold the firm to Nevs in June last year.

The new owners have said they want to focus on electric cars as they look to revive the brand.

SAAB’s origins go back to 1937 when Sweden’s Svenska Aeroplan Aktiebolaget (SAAB) was founded in Trollhättan to manufacture military aircraft.

At the end of the Second World War, in which neutral Sweden played no active part. SAAB diversified into cars with the first production of the two-stroke-engine Saab 92.

It soon became a household name in Sweden and in the 1970s it released its first turbocharged model - the landmark Saab 99.

Saabs found favour with architects, independent spirits and  maverick entrepreneurs such as Virgin boss Sir Richard.

Loyal enthusiasts appreciated SAAB  for its aerodynamic style and quirks like placing the ignition lock between the front seats rather than on the steering column.

It was the first to offer heated seating in 1971.
