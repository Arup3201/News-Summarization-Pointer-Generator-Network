Matt Lauer is siding with his former Today Show co-host as he is allegedly telling NBC executives to let Ann Curry out of her contract so that they both can move on.

The move shows a change of heart from Lauer as he was said to be one of the major reasons why Curry was so publicly ousted from the Today Show in April.

But really his siding with Curry may be an act of self-interest because he thinks that it would be a way for him and the network at large to move past the bad publicity that they earned after using Curry as a scapegoat for the fledgling ratings.

Curry is being not-so-quietly courted by CNN as her former boss Jeff Zucker has taken over the cable channel and wants to replace Anderson Cooper's 8pm show with her familiar face.

The 56-year-old journalist officially needs approval from NBC to be released from her multi-year contract before going on the air for another network, and though she gave them that notice two weeks ago, the bosses have not handed down word yet.

Lauer, however, thinks that they are just dragging the fight out longer by not cutting their ties.

'He canâ€™t imagine why the bosses are dragging their feet and are at a stalemate,' a source told Radar Online.

'It would allow Ann to get back on the
 air on a regular basis and everyone can move on from the debacle. Matt 
only wishes Ann the best and thinks itâ€™s for the best if she were to 
take a job at another network..'

Curry's lawyers are arguing that her dramatic demotion from Today in April was in fact a breach of her contract terms by NBC.

'Ann's lawyer feels that there is a 
very strong case to be made that NBC has breached terms of the deal 
because Curry was demoted from Today,' a different source previously 
told RadarOnline.

'Furthermore,
 Ann has basically been sequestered from appearing on the network. Yes, 
she has been doing some work that has been assigned to her, but it 
hasn't been steady.'

Zucker, previously executive producer at
 the Today show and one-time head of NBC Universal, wants to put Curry 
in the prime-time 8pm slot currently occupied by Anderson Cooper, 
RadarOnline reported.

Today is set to finish the year 
trailing its rival Good Morning America. Curry was dumped as co-anchor 
of the NBC morning show after Today lost its top spot, as 
bosses thought a fresh face may bring back viewers.

But
 the depressing ratings got worse, something which has vindicated Curry,
 according to RadarOnline. The website claims things 
won't improve for Today until NBC sets Curry free.

'The numbers just don't lie. (Ann) wasn't responsible for the show tanking in the ratings,' the insider said. 'Ann doesn't like the fact that the show isn't back on top, but her on-air presence wasn't the problem.

'In fact, the show lost more viewers after Ann departed the show. As long as Ann remains at NBC, it will be a constant reminder to everyone of how badly the situation was handled.

'It would be so much better for NBC, Ann, and CNN if she was let out of her contract. It would be a new beginning and a chance for all parties involved to move on, once and for all.'

A source recently told The New York Post that Cooper could transition to a 'Christiane Amanpour role' as a globetrotting correspondent, if Curry bumped him from his spot.
