Babies are known for putting anything and everything in their mouths, from Lego to crayons.

But a study suggests that this isn't necessarily a misbehaving habit, but rather a brain mechanism wired from birth.

Research performed by the Institute of Cognitive Sciences in Bron, France, points to a 'survival of the fittest' mentality that ensures the baby survives even when other sensors haven't developed.

Researchers suggest that a baby's habit of putting things in its mouth is a cognitive ability learned in the womb

A drug known as Donepezil, used to improve memory function in Alzehimer's patients, has found another use as a brain stimulant for adults.

Researchers at Harvard University found that the drug can revert adult brains to the quick-learning phase of children's brains.

It increases the elasticity of the brain, making it capable of learning rapidly in these 'critical periods'.

The drug was used to successfully rewire a visually impaired patient's brain to process images.

To investigate this human trait,  Director of Neuropsychology Angela Sirigu and her team studied 26 patients who were undergoing brain surgery.

While unconscious, they were able to make nine of the patients move their hands to their mouths by stimulating regions of the brain known to perform these actions.

The fact that this behaviour is programmed into the same region of the brain in every person suggests that it is most likely an ability present in our brains before birth.

If it was a learned skill, different regions of the brain would be involved in performing the action and it would change between individuals, but this was not the case.

By stimulating sections of the brain, the researchers were able to make nine of 26 brain surgery patients unconsciously move their hands to their mouths, suggesting such a movement is wired into our brains

This suggests that our motion of moving our hands to our mouths, perhaps to consistently supply us with food from a young age, is something that is wired into the circuitry of the brain.

Even when in the womb, foetuses are known to suck their thumbs, a precursor action to actually putting food into their mouths.

'If you've ever looked at a newborn primate's brain or a baby's brain, it's surprising that they work at all,' Jon Kaas, a neuroscientist at Vanderbilt University in Tennessee, US told New Scientist.

'The neurons aren't mature and the consistency of the brain is sort of like pudding.

'But some things have to work right away.'
