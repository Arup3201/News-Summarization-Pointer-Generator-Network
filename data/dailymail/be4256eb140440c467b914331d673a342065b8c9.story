When 18-year-old Calvin Conger hooked a stingray while fishing in Florida, he intended to chop it up before sticking it back on a hook to use as shark bait.

But instead he ended up helping the female ray to give birth to two pups after noticing the fish had a second stinger sticking out of its behind.

That tiny tail turned out to be the rear end of a baby stingray, as the mother was halfway through giving birth when she was caught.

Fisherman Calvin Conger, 18, found himself playing doctor after catching a pregnant stingray before helping it give birth to two pups on board his family's boat

Conger was about to cut the fish up to use as shark bait before noticing it had an extra stinger sticking out of it's rear end. As his father Terry gave the animal's stomach a push, a baby ray popped out

Calvin's father, Terry, instinctively stepped in, pushing down on the ray's belly while Calvin's mother, Valerie, recorded the bizarre incident.

As Terry gently prodded the creature, the tiny baby ray popped out and began wriggling around in the boat, followed shortly by another.

Despite nearly becoming fish food, the story had a happy ending for the mother ray and her two new babies, as Calvin decided to let the family go back into the ocean.

Calvin told HLN: ‘We put it on the filleting table because we were going to use it for bait.

‘We got a closer look at it and there was a stinger hanging out. I can put it on my resume that I helped birth a stingray.'

Calvin was out fishing with his family in Port Charlotte, Florida when the incredible event occurred.

After the first baby ray was born, the Conger family noticed another stinger, before helping the fish to give birth to a second pup

Despite nearly being turned into fish food, the ray and her babies were released back into the ocean

Rays are ovoviviparous, meaning they carry litters of young inside them numbering up to 13 which feed on individual yolk sacks.

Female rays are capable of storing a male ray's sperm inside their bodies without getting pregnant for years before impregnating themselves at a later date.

A pair of rays gave birth to seven young at the Sea Life Aquarium in London despite not having been in the same tank as a male for two years.
