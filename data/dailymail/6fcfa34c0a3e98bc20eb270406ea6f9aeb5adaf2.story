The new prosecutor in the disappearance of Madeleine McCann is 'determined' to solve the child's disappearance

A new Portuguese prosecutor has been charged with solving the disappearance of Madeleine McCann seven years after the British child vanished from her holiday apartment.

Ines Sequeira will lead the investigation into the case as Scotland Yard prepares to return to Praia da Luz to 're-interview' three suspects.

Ms Sequeira is said to be 'utterly determined' to solve the case, bringing fresh hope to the child's parents, Kate and Gerry McCann. 

'Ines is still trying to get her feet under the table and is having to be briefed on scores of cases including Madeleine’s,' a source close to the investigation said.

'But she has been appointed as the new prosecutor and the Scotland Yard team has been given renewed hope of being able to start work again in Portugal before the end of the month.

'Ms Sequeira is one of the sharpest and most ambitious prosecutors in Portugal. 

'She is utterly determined to get a result on the Madeleine inquiry.'

It comes after British police sent a fifth letter to Portuguese officers requesting access to the investigation.

'They’re banking on this new meeting with Portuguese police being their chance to argue their case face-to-face,' the source added. 

'Ines will obviously take the final decision on the letter but she’ll consult the police chiefs on the Algarve before making her mind up.'

Her appointment comes after the public prosecutor's position was left empty for almost a month following the departure of Jose Magalhes e Menezes.

Scotland Yard officers are due to fly to Portugal next week to re-interview three of seven suspects previously questioned in Faro police stations. 

Among them are Jose Carlos Fernandes da Silva, an ex-worker at the Ocean Club resort, Paulo Ribeiro, who looks like a man seen near the apartment, and charity collector Ricardo Rodrigues.

British Police efforts to find the child such as digs and sewer searches were previously dismissed by Portuguese police as 'senseless' 

Portuguese officers asserted in the past the culprit was foreign and had left the country 

It comes after a woman, accused of sending hateful messages to Kate and Gerry McCann online, committed suicide after being confronted. 

An inquest into the death of Brenda Leyland, who allegedly 'trolled' the couple on Twitter, is ongoing. 

Madeleine McCann vanished from the room she was sharing with her younger twin siblings while her parents were eating dinner in a restaurant in the resort in May 2007.

Several men, including a Cape Verde immigrant and heroin addict who died in 2009 following a tractor incident, have been considered as suspects but no one has been charged over the child’s disappearance. 

Previously Portuguese police dismissed British investigator's methods as 'senseless', asserting Madeleine's kidnapper was foreign and no longer in the country.
