Clueless star turned Fox News contributor Stacey Dash, 47, is dating a 25-year-old toyboy who is just a year older than her son, MailOnline can reveal today.

The actress, a three-times divorced mother-of-two, is dating Michael Evers, an aspiring actor and model who lives in her building in Los Angeles - and the pair were seen working up a sweat as they hiked around their neighborhood today.

A friend of Evers joked: 'Michael is the Ashton Kutcher of West Hollywood - he's already dated Nora Schweihs from Mob Wives and she was a LOT older than him!

Cougar town: Clueless actress turned Fox contributor Stacey Dash goes for a morning hike with new toyboy Michael Evers in Los Angeles today

Ex-love: Budding actor Michael Evers and his former girlfriend, Mob Wives: Chicago's Nora Schweihs in June 2012

'But he really likes Stacey and he's taken her hiking and to the Sunset Tower Hotel and she's taking him with her to New York next month.'

Stacey is mom to son Austin, 24, from her relationship with singer Christopher Williams, and a daughter, Lola, 11, from her second marriage to James Maby.

She has been married three times - and after divorcing Lovell in 2005, she had a short-lived one-year marriage to James Maby, that ended in 2005.

Her third marriage to actor Emmanuel Xuereb ended in divorce in 2011 after she accused him of physically abusing her throughout their marriage and claiming she was too afraid to report him to the police.

She won a restraining order against Xuereb, and that was still in effect at the time her divorce was granted.

'She likes younger men now,' a friend said: 'She has turned into a cougar.'

When the Mail Online contacted Evers, he said:'I don’t want to talk about Stacy right now, but she is a great girl.'

A representative for Stacey told MailOnline: 'I can confirm that Stacey is not dating the actor seen in the pictures. He actually is one of Stacey's neighbour's nephews. They just went on a run.'

Speaking in 2011, Stacey, who appeared in VH1's Single Ladies, said that after three marriages she was happy to be on her own, admitting: 'A lot of it was me needing a man to define me. I’m finally at a point where I want to define myself.

'The most important thing is knowing yourself and loving yourself and loving yourself by you, not by anyone else. What I’ve realized after being married so many times is that I don’t need a man to be happy. That has been my greatest lesson and that’s why I try to teach my children-to love themselves. They don’t need someone else’s approval or definition. They can do that themselves.'

Despite this, Stacey said she would marry again, saying: 'Absolutely. I’ve been engaged six times, married three and I still believe it’s possible.'

Stacey, who appeared in VH1's Single Ladies, joined Fox News in May as a contributor after proudly publicly proclaiming her Republican views.

support for Mitt Romney (right, on the campaign trail), posting this sexy picture with her endorsement 

‘Stacey
 is an engaging conversationalist whose distinctive viewpoints amongst 
her Hollywood peers have spawned national debates,’ said Fox News Executive Vice 
President of Programming Bill Shine.

Stacey, who remains best known for her portrayal of valley girl Dionne Davenport in Clueless in which she appeared alongside Alicia Silverstone, will offer cultural analysis and commentary across Fox News' daytime and prime time program

Her
 Republican beliefs caused a firestorm for the actress during the 2012 
election when she publicly announced her support for Mitt Romney, unlike many African American voters.

In the past two years she has made 
several appearances on Fox News as a guest commentator including 
appearing on the new Fox News show Outnumbered as a guest panelist.

‘I
 just think that the Democrats and the liberals have taken advantage of 
showbusiness, but California and showbusiness is the purest form of 
capitalism, and that's a fact,’ she said during an appearance on Fox and
 Friends in early April.

She went on to explain that she is a proponent of states’ rights and the importance of localized government programs.

‘For the federal government
 to just throw a big blanket over a big entire country and say "We're 
all a bunch of babies and now we're all warm and cozy" is just a bit 
ridiculous,’ she said.

The New York Post recently reported that Stacey is in talks with the network about developing a satirical comedy series about a single mom in Hollywood.

During an interview with CNN's Piers Morgan at the time, Stacey used a line made famous by Martin Luther King Jr, saying that she chose her presidential pick 'not by the color of his skin but the content of his character'.

The interview came after she received a barrage of social media attacks for calling a vote for Romney 'the only choice for your future'.

While many took issue with Stacey, then-Vice Presidential candidate Paul Ryan reached out to her to thank her.

'He said thank you so much for your support, and that I was brave and that they support me and I thought that was so generous and kind, lovely,' Dash told Morgan.

She said that she switched from supporting President Obama in 2008 to endorsing his 2012 opponent 'because of the state of the country'.

She said: 'I want the next four years to be different,'
