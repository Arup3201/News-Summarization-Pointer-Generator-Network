A woman was today sentenced to life in prison after murdering her lesbian lover by hitting her on the head with an ornamental concrete swan.

Tracey Ashfield killed her lover Wendy Thorpe as the couple argued about money at their home.

She then dragged her body to the bottom of the garden and covered it with an old sofa cover in an attempt to hide it.

Wolverhampton Crown Court heard that the couple had been arguing about their finances all day on July 14 last year.

They had dinner together at their home in Walsall, West Midlands in an attempt to reconcile, but the row started up again.

The women's fight ended with Ashfield, 43, pushing her 42-year-old girlfriend to to the ground and hitting her with the 7kg decorative bird.

The remorseful killer stayed with her lover's body for the rest of the night then hid the corpse under pieces of wood and carrier bags as well as the sofa cover.

The next day she wrote a confession then handed herself in to police.

Ashfield pleaded guilty to murder on Monday and was sentenced to life imprisonment. She will serve at least 13 years.

'This was a tragic case where an argument went too far and someone has lost their life as a result,' said the investigating officer, Detective Constable Jeff Neal.

'We received a call from Ashfield the day after the incident, after she became wracked with guilt about what had happened.

'We hope that this result will bring some comfort and closure to Wendy's family.'

Hayley Firman, head of the West Midlands Crown Prosecution Service's public protection unit, said: 'On Saturday 14 July 2012, Ashfield was with her partner at their home when they got into a heated argument over money.

'The argument turned physical and she then picked up a garden ornament and repeatedly struck Ms Thorpe over the head and upper body.

'Realising that Ms Thorpe was not breathing, rather than calling the emergency services for assistance, Ashfield dragged the body to the bottom of the garden and covered it with a blanket, an old settee cushion and garden rubbish in order to conceal the body.

'The following day, she wrote a confessional note, drove away and later telephoned the police telling them what she had done. She was arrested, charged and today she has pleaded guilty of murdering her partner and sentenced to life imprisonment.'
