A Poirot fan who found Agatha Christie's lost jewels inside a mysterious trunk she bought for just £100 has sold them at auction - for a £50,000 profit.

Jennifer Grant, 65, from Nutley, East Sussex, bought the container in 2006 at a sale at the legendary crime novelist's former home Greenway, in Devon.

Inside the trunk that once belonged to Christie's mother Clara was a box locked and bolted to the base but no key.

The travelling trunk was part of a contents sale at the novelist's former estate, Greenway near Brixham, Devon

When Jennifer forced it open with a crowbar in 2010, she found 52 gold coins, a diamond brooch and a three-stone diamond ring.

The two pieces of jewellery are mentioned in Christie's biography as prized family heirlooms that were intended to be handed down to her and her sister Madge.

Jennifer decided to sell the coins to pay for a bathroom and auction off the brooch and the ring, hoping to raise enough funds to buy a narrowboat - wish she plans on calling The Good Ship Agatha.

The brooch was expected to fetch £8,000 but it fetched £27,500 - more than three times its estimate - at Bonhams' Knightsbridge auction house today.

A bidding frenzy among Christie fans also ensured the ring, worth an estimated £5,000, went for £21,875 - giving stunned Jennifer a total profit of £49,275.

Bonhams has not revealed who bought the prized items, of which Christie had written: 'My mother's valuable jewellery consisted of "my diamond buckle" and "my diamond engagement ring".

'Madge was to have the diamond crescent, I was to have the diamond buckle.'

Jennifer said of her amazing literary find: 'They matched the description exactly. I was nearly hyperventilating.

'I almost didn't want to open the strongbox because then the mystery would be over.

'When friends came round we would tip the trunk from one side to the other and listen to hear if anything rattled.

'If you were very quiet you could just about hear something light sliding inside.

Christie called Greenway 'the most beautiful place in the world' and it was there that she and her husband lived for the rest of their lives.

The secluded property features in several of Christie's novels with its secretive walled gardens, tennis court and boat house on the winding River Dart.

The house was passed to Agatha's daughter Rosalind who lived there until her death in 2004. 

The travelling trunk belonged to Agatha Christie's mother. The author is pictured here, at home
