With their little faces looking up to the camera, six breeds of foxes stand patiently awaiting their lunch.

This is Fox Village, in Japan’s Miyagi prefecture, where for less than £4 (700 Japanese Yen) visitors are allowed entry and can feed the animals.

Foxes are heralded in Japan, with many believing they have mystical powers, as well as others who believe they bring    good luck as they descend from Inari Okami, the Shinto deity of fertility, prosperity and rice.

Guests are encouraged to feed the foxes, but it's sensible not to put your fingers too close

And while foxes have received a fair amount of negative press for involving themselves in urban areas and causing mischief, these are simply too cute.

The sanctuary is found near the mountains near Shiroishi, where in addition to six different types of foxes, there are over 100 varieties of animals housed.

And don't worry if you are slightly fearful of feeding the foxes - staff are on hand to advise you of the correct way to pass them the food.

The fox village is split into two sections. The first has foxes in pens and cages, some are sadly on a lead, but that's more for their own safety.

The first part of the fox village sees the animals in their pens, all six different breeds

A walk through a door and you get to get up close and personal to the foxes, who are on the lookout for food

However, after going through another door, you are thrust into a very different environment.

Foxes wander freely, some will run up to you eager to get their snack, others will be scared and run off into the bushes.

It's easy to forget that foxes are still wild animals, as the furry animals scamper around, but visitors are advised not to pet to close to their mouths.
