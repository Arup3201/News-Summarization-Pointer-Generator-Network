One person was killed and three others severely injured on Thursday afternoon when a truck carrying Fourth of July fireworks detonated outside a central Texas high school as workers prepared for the show.

Local town chiropractor, Dr. Russell C. Reynolds died in the blast and Harry Dudley, Eddir Parker and Rex Plumlee were all critically hurt readying the show at Comanche High School.

It is unclear what triggered the explosion which happened by the baseball field when crews were unloading tubes containing fireworks in the town of 4,300 people, 100 miles southwest of Fort Worth.

All the injured were members of the Kiwanis Club setting up their annual fireworks display and Lt. Marcus Nettleton of the local police confirmed the death of one man, a club member, and that three others were hospitalized with serious injuries.

The club has organized the fireworks show for the past 24 years with no previous accidents, Nettleton said.

'These were very experienced men in what they were doing,' Nettleton said of the workers preparing the display.

'They knew what they were doing.'

Christine Perkins, executive director of the Comanche Chamber of Commerce, said Friday's Fourth of July events have been canceled. She said the fireworks show has been one of the largest in the region, drawing 15,000 people, many from metropolitan areas such as Dallas, Fort Worth and Austin.

'We're still in shock,' she said. 'And definitely in a community our size, there will be some kind of ceremony' to recognize the victims, she said.

The agency has a permit on file that authorized Friday's pyrotechnics, said Rachel Moreno, spokeswoman for the fire marshal's office to USA Today.

She declined to release any additional information, citing the ongoing investigation into the explosion.

The Texas fire marshal's office and U.S. Bureau of Alcohol, Tobacco, Firearms and Explosives are investigating, Nettleton said.

City Development Director Jackie Stewart said the trailer holding the fireworks exploded on the softball field next to the school, CBSDFW.COM reports.

'There was an explosion, a trailer and vehicles caught on fire,' said Stewart.Â
