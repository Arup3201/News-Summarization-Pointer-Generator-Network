What a summer it could have been. While Phiipp Lahm and the Germany team arrived back in Berlin as heroes with the World Cup trophy, England captain Steven Gerrard found himself in an entirely different environment.

The Liverpool midfielder is currently enjoying a summer holiday with his family in Ibiza, spotted relaxing on a pedalo.

His club team-mates have long-since returned to training, including Rickie Lambert who is eager to make an impression at Anfield.

Meanwhile, in Berlin: Philipp Lahm holds up the World Cup as the German national team return

Gerrard would have loved to have been greeted to a sea of white and red back at Trafalgar Square, but with no wins in Brazil it wasn't to be.

After a long and stressful season, especially after an arguably decisive slip against Chelsea in the Premier League, few would argue the 34-year-old didn't deserve more time off.

And in quite a contrast to Jack Wilshere in Las Vegas, Gerrard has been hitting the gym frequently on holiday.

It's just a shame he was only greeted by a handful of photographers upon his arrival in England, rather than the hundreds of thousands of fans.
