A former British ambassador to Afghanistan today denounced the 2014 deadline for the withdrawal of troops from the country as a further bombing in the country claimed the lives of 19 civilians.

Sir Sherard Cowper-Coles, ambassador from 2007 to 2009, said the move was 'worse than questionable, it's disgraceful' if it was not accompanied by a determined peace process.

Nato troops, including UK forces, are to be withdrawn from combat roles by 2015.

His comments come as Afghanistan's president Hamid Karzai today vowed to confront the Pakistani government over yesterday's devastating suicide bombing against a Shiite shrine in Kabul.

The attack on the holiest day of the Shia calendar killed 59, including one U.S. citizen.

Mr Karzai said the attack originated 
in Pakistan, putting further pressure on already strained relations 
between the two neighbours. Relations dropped to a new low after a Nato 
air strike hit an army checkpoint in north-west Pakistan killing 24 
soldiers.

Ever since then Pakistan has blocked Nato supplies heading through its country to Afghanistan.

The Afghan leader today visited a hospital where scores of people who had been wounded in yesterday's attack were being treated.

'We are investigating this issue and we are going to talk to the Pakistani government about it,' he said.

He said the attack was not just an act of hate against Muslims, but against mankind.

'Afghanistan cannot ignore the blood 
of all the victims of this incident, especially the children,' he added.
Karzai cut short a European trip and returned to Kabul this morning 
because of the attack.

Today's slaughter was caused when a 
roadside bomb in Helmand Province struck a minibus struck in the Taliban
stronghold of Sangin, where more than 100 UK soldiers lost their lives 
during the war.

Sir Sherard, an outspoken critic of 
the government's tactics, said: 'It is very questionable - it's worse 
than questionable, it's disgraceful if it's not accompanied by serious 
political strategy.     

Fears: As families gathered for funerals across the city today, it was still unclear what the political reverberations of the attack might be

Funeral: Afghanistan's Shi'ite community of mostly Hazaras make up about 20 per cent of the nation's 30 million population

Slaughter: The victims were killed as they gathered to honour the death of Imam Hussein, a grandson of the Prophet Muhammad, in 680 A.D.

'Had the decision to stop fighting 
been accompanied by an effort led by [US Secretary of State Hillary] 
Clinton to bring all the regional leaders together and keep them 
together until they thrashed out an agreement, had we started a serious 
peace process ... then signalling to the people of Afghanistan that our 
troops were going to come out of combat wouldn't have been a bad thing.

'But to do it without that is rather 
similar to our scuttle from Palestine in 1948 or our scuttle from India 
in 1947 - it's tactics without strategy.

'It breaks my heart, because we owe 
it to the people of Afghanistan, we owe it to all our servicemen and 
women who have fought and died and been wounded in Afghanistan.'

Yesterday's IED strike come amid 
mourning for 59 people, mainly Shia worshippers, who were killed in twin
bomb attacks in the country on Tuesday.

Another simultaneous smaller 
explosion in the north of the country killed four people in a holiday 
vehicle procession. It marked the first major assault on a Muslim sect 
in Afghanistan in recent memory.

A man claiming to be from 
Lashkar-e-Jhangvi al-Alami, a Pakistan-based splinter group of the 
Lashkar-e-Jhangvi terror group that has carried out attacks against 
Shiite Muslims in Pakistan, claimed responsibility for the Kabul 
bombing.

The attack on the Shi'ite shrine in 
Kabul was unprecedented. As well as the 59 dead a further 160 
worshippers were injured. They had gathered to commemorate the holiday 
of Ashoura, which honours the death of Imam Hussein, a grandson of the 
Prophet Muhammad, in 680 AD.

Mr Karzai said Pakistan-based Lashkar-e-Jhangvi had claimed reponsibility for the attack.

He added: 'This is the first time in 
Afghanistan, on a very important religious day, they have acted. Without
doubt it is hostile to Afghanistan, the people of Afghanistan, and 
Islam.'

Lashkar-e-Jhangvi is one of 
Pakistan's most violent anti-Shi'ite groups and part of an Al 
Qaeda-linked nexus of militants. It has also forged strong ties with 
militant groups operating in the tribal areas on the Afghan border.

The group emerged as a sectarian 
force in the 1990s, targeting minority Shi'ite Muslims, but graduated to
more audacious attacks, like the truck bombing of Islamabad's Marriott 
Hotel in 2008 in which 55 people were killed.

As families gathered for funerals 
across the city, it was still unclear what the political reverberations 
of the attack might be.

The Taliban condemned the attack, 
which was reminiscent of the wave of sectarian bloodshed that shook Iraq
during the height of the war there.

Suspicion centred on militant groups based in neighbouring Pakistan, where Sunni attacks on minority Shi'ites are common.

A man who claimed to be from 
Lashkar-e-Jhangvi, a Pakistan-based group that has carried out attacks 
against Shi'ite Muslims, called various media outlets in Pakistan to 
claim responsibility for the bombing in Kabul. The validity of the claim
could not be determined.

Until now, the decade-long Afghan war
has largely been spared sectarian violence, where civilians are 
targeted simply for their membership of a particular religious group.

Yesterday's attack suggests that at 
least some militant groups may have changed tactics, taking aim at 
ethnic minorities such as the Hazara who are largely Shi'ite and support
the Afghan government and its Western partners.

Afghanistan's Shi'ite community of mostly Hazaras make up about 20 per cent of the nation's 30 million population.

Hard-line Sunnis consider Shi'ites non-believers because their customs and traditions differ from the majority sect.

President Karzai had been in Germany 
for a global conference about the future of security in Afghanistan,  
where U.S. Secretary of State Hillary Clinton had vowed to keep 
supporting the country after most foreign forces leave the country in 
2014.

It comes as the nation faces an enduring Taliban-led insurgency and possible financial collapse.

'The United States is prepared to 
stand with the Afghan people for the long haul,' U.S. Secretary of State
Hillary Rodham Clinton told the conference, that was overshadowed by 
the absence of key regional player, Pakistan.

The international community has 'much to lose if the country again becomes a source of terrorism and instability' she added.

The conference was focused on the 
transfer of security responsibilities from international forces to 
Afghan security forces during the next three years, as well as long-term
prospects for international aid and a possible political settlement 
with the Taliban to ensure the country's viability beyond 2014.

Clinton stressed that in return for 
continued support the Afghans must live up to their commitments 'on 
taking difficult decisions to embrace reform, lead in their own defense 
and strengthen an inclusive democracy rooted in the rule of law'.

About 100 countries and international
organisations were represented among the 1,000 conference delegates in 
the German city of Bonn, including some 60 foreign ministers.

Afghanistan is economically dependent
on foreign aid and spending related to the huge military presence, 
currently totalling about 130,000 international troops. The country 
seeks assurance that donor nations will help fill the gap after most 
forces leave by 2015.

Afghanistan estimates it will need 
outside contributions of roughly $10billion in 2015, or slightly less 
than half the country's annual gross national product, mostly to pay for
its security forces, then slated to number about 350,000.

Pakistan is a central player in 
regional efforts to improve trade and strengthen its weak economies. But
its boycott has cast a pall over the session, because it points out 
that nation's influence in Afghanistan and its ability to play the 
spoiler.

Pakistan is seen as instrumental to 
ending the Taliban-led insurgency in Afghanistan because of its links to
militant groups and its unwillingness, from the U.S. and NATO 
perspective, to drive insurgents from safe havens on its soil where they
regroup and rearm.
