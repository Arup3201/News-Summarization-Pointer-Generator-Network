Police say they are ready for the arrival of thousands of Turkish supporters when Galatasaray and Besiktas arrive in London to face Arsenal and Tottenham respectively this week.

Last season’s derby between the Istanbul clubs was abandoned when hundreds of fans stormed the pitch with Galatasaray leading 2-1 thanks to two Didier Drogba goals. Police used teargas to disperse the rioters and Drogba and the rest of the players were forced to flee to safety.

Gala now face Arsenal in the Champions League at the Emirates Stadium on Wednesday, while Besiktas take on Spurs in the Europa League at White Hart Lane 24 hours later.

Galatasaray have sold 3,000 tickets and 2,800 are expected from Besiktas.

And a spokesman for the Metropolitan Police said: ‘We are aware of the background of the two clubs and appropriate plans will be in place. We are also aware that the clubs will have supporters already based in London.’

A spokesman for British Transport Police added: ‘We are used to dealing with large numbers of fans and we are liaising with the clubs to make sure everyone is safe and on the move.

‘If anyone is in difficulty or sees something they wish to report, our new text-message service to 61016 is available.’

In 2012, followers of the two clubs rioted at a wheelchair basketball match. Hooligans traded insults and sprayed fire extinguishers at each other, while the court was left littered with broken wheelchairs.
