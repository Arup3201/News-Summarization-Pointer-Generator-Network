It is the ultimate recreational vehicle - and send to make one four year old extremely happy.

The KiraVan, a giant custom built off road truck, is capable of travelling almost anywhere in the world and was designed by 61 year old Californian inventor Bran Ferren.

The incredible interior boasts everything from a fully stocked office, kitchen and bedroom, to a popup tent on the roof for Kira, Ferren's four year daughter the truck was designed for.

22 cameras to monitor traffic and the truck's exterior

Bran Ferren, the 61 year old cofounder and chief creative officer of Applied Minds, a world-renowned tech and design firm whose on-the-record customer list includes General Motors, Intel, and the US Air Force, has spent four years traveling the world to talk to experts as he finalised the truck's design.

The huge six-wheeled vehicle can drive down mud-swamped roads, and even rock covered roads thanks to kevlar reinforced tyres.

It will be able to travel up to 2,000 miles without resupply and navigate slopes as steep as 45 degrees thanks to a special suspension system.

The cockpit also has a special vibration reducing chair, as well as control for drones that can fly ahead to check traffic.

However, while the truck itself is impressive, the trailer is even more so.

At 31 feet long and more than 10 feet high, it is better equipped than most homes.

It has an ecofriendly bathroom, a custom-designed kitchen where meals can be prepared, along with storage space for two weeks of traveling.

The office: Two large computers allow Ferren to see and control any aspect of the supervan

The cockpit has a series of custom-made, overhead- and dash-mounted touchscreen cockpit displays, which monitor the vehicle¿s health and navigational progress; a joystick-operated situational-awareness system, which allows passengers to see the view from any one of the vehicles¿ 22 cameras and provides infrared thermal imagery of the road¿s temperature.

The Kiravan also has a full kitchen and dining area in the main trailer

The kitchen will be able to sustain a family of three for two to three weeks, and for longer trips other equipment can be removed to make more storage space

When completed, the KiraVan will be able to travel up to 2,000 miles without resupply and navigate slopes as steep as 45 degrees

The off road truck has been developed to be able to traverse any terrain

Antennas and dishes on the roof give the truck its communications capabilities, and can be hoisted up when the truck is stationary.

The KiraVan's chassis has been stretched and reinforced so the cab, adapted from a Mercedes-Benz Unimog, can accommodate all of the additions.
