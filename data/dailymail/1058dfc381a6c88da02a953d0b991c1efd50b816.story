A 'modern-day Talented Mr Ripley' has been accused by a Marchioness of defrauding her animal welfare charity out of a £4,000 bronze statue of a pig.

Tracy Ward, the Marchioness of Worcester, claims convicted conman Matthew Brown stole the statue, which was due to be auctioned to raise money for her ethical farming campaign group Farms Not Factories.

Brown, 29, successfully bid for the piece, named the Dittisham Lady, at the fundraiser in March - but the Marchioness says he paid for the item with an 'uncashable' cheque, likening him to the con artist character in The Talented Mr Ripley.

In both Patricia Highsmith's novel and the 1999 film staring Matt Damon, Tom Ripley manages to worm his way into a high society circle using forgery and impersonation.

Brown denies behaving fraudulently, and says he lawfully bought the 12in-long statue, created by sculptor Nick Bibby.

The Marchioness, a former actress who starred in 1980s TV detective series CATS Eyes and as Miss Scarlett in Cluedo, has reported the matter to police after she turned investigator - searching CCTV footage from the event to try to establish what happened to the prized artwork.

She alleges that Brown, who has a string of convictions dating back to when he was a teenager, was last seen leaving the event in a taxi with the pig.

According the the Marchioness, the pair met at the fundraiser held at London’s exclusive No.41 Mayfair club for her charity, which is supported by Robert F. Kennedy Jr, Sir Paul McCartney and Tom Parker Bowles, and is behind campaign film series The Pig Business.

She says that Brown told her he was a Monaco-based millionaire named Sebastian Von Anhalt, and the boyfriend of one of her acquaintances.

She said she did not know who she was, but that he pledged to raise £100,000 for her charity with the help of his rich friends.

At the auction he then bid £4,000 for the statue before handing over a cheque for $18,000 Canadian dollars, with the instruction that the money be taken from that sum, according to the Marchioness.

'I absolutely would not have let him take the pig until the cheque had cleared but he left with it that night,' she told The Sunday Times.

The Marchioness alleged that after she found she was unable to cash the cheque and although Brown initially agreed to transfer the money to the charity's account, he then ceased all contact with her.

She then spoke to the man Brown had said was his boyfriend.

'He told me it was a lie and that he'd known this man for a very brief period of time before discovering he "isn't what he claims to be",' she said.

'I spoke to more people and found out he's actually this Talented Mr Ripley-type who just goes round wrecking lives.'

In 2004, aged just 20, Brown admitted deception charges after posing as an aristocrat to get a credit card, running up bills of thousands of pounds.

He had posed as a lord and City worker, using credit cards to fund a lavish lifestyle including visits to top hotels and trips in limousines, but in reality was unemployed and had no intention of paying the £18,000 in bills, Middlesex Guildhall Crown Court was told.

Brown was given a three-month rehabilitation order after he admitted nine charges of obtaining services by deception.

In 2009 he was given a 30 month jail sentence after being convicted of further fraud and deception counts.

He is still under investigation over allegations he defrauded former Lincolnshire police commissioner candidate Mervyn Barrett.

It is alleged Brown, who was acting as Mr Barrett's campaign manager, ran up thousands of pounds of debts without his permission.

Mr Barrett stepped down from his 2012 campaign after he discovered money was apparently missing from his bank account.

Brown denies any wrongdoing in the matter of the statue.

MailOnline was unable to reach solictors for Brown at the time of publication, however, a statement issued by Brown’s lawyers in April said: ‘He categorically denies he behaved fraudulently’ and that he ‘lawfully purchased’ the pig.
