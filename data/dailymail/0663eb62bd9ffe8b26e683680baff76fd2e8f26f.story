Hull City have completed the signing of Tom Ince from Championship club Blackpool.

The 22-year-old had been linked with a host of clubs including Stoke and QPR but has decided to join the Tigers.

The frontman, having opted to remain in England in search of a Premier League club following talks with Italian giants Inter Milan, has signed a two-year-deal with Steve Bruce's side.

Ongoing: Despite being a free agent, Hull will still have to agree a fee with Blackpool as Ince is under 24

Ince, son of former Manchester United midfielder Paul, said: ‘I’m looking forward to the challenge ahead. It will be my first full premier League season.‘I’ve come to a club with great ambition. The moment I stepped in I could see a project and I’m very happy to be here.

‘I feel that I’ve proved myself at Championship level and the next step is the Premier League. I think it’s the right move for me at this time.

‘I’ve come to a club that is in the same situation as I am - looking to become established in the Premier League.

‘It’s no easy feat. You have to work hard in the Premier League. We’ve got a good squad here and it’s improving all the time. The challenge is to push us up the league and try to finish higher than last season.’

He told Sky Sports News: 'I've known Steve Bruce on a personal and professional level for quite some years, being in a former team with my old man.

'I also know a lot of the players so it felt like home to me. I didn't feel like a stranger walking into the dressing room, into the ground.

'The staff there, the people on the board, made me feel ever so welcome and sometimes you have to go with your heart.

'To be given an opportunity to play again in the Premier League, it's a fantastic opportunity for me and one that I'm relishing.'

Ince also feels Hull can look to the future with optimism with the squad they are building.

'You walk in and there's a strong British core throughout the team,' he said.

'The manager's bringing in some big names who have Premier League experience and we want to try and build on last season.

'The cup run was fantastic for the club. Now we have to look at having a stronger Premier League position, the Europa League is a fantastic achievement as well.

'There's a lot going on at the club at the minute and that shows it's moving in the right direction.'

The England Under 21 international, who ended last season on loan at Crystal Palace, was a free agent after his contract with the Tangerines expired.

However, as Ince is under the age of 24, Hull will still need to pay a fee to Blackpool and a tribunal may be necessary if a figure cannot be settled upon.

He met with Hull officials last week and a deal was concluded after further talks on Monday.

Ince came through the youth ranks at Liverpool at had a loan spell at Notts County before moving to Blackpool in 2011.

He has been linked with a return to Liverpool on numerous occasions in the past but a move back to Anfield never materialised.

Ince becomes the Tigers' third signing of the summer following the arrivals of Jake Livermore and Robert Snodgrass.
