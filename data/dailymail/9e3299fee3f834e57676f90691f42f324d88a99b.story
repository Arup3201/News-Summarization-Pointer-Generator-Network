Dropped: Gary Neville has abandoned plans to build his eco-home following the displeasure shown by nearby residents

Football star Gary Neville has shelved plans for his controversial 'Teletubbies' eco-home over fears that it would lead to neighbourly feuds.

The former Premier League footballer wanted to build a country home almost entirely underground with locals dubbing it the second Teletubbyland- make-believe home of the cuddly TV characters.

But now the England coach has ditched the plans for the multi-million pound luxury eco-bunker over concerns that he would be 'alienated' by his neighbours.

He said: 'There was a lot of local displeasure around the house and it did shock me - how many people were against it and the wind turbine we planned.

'We certainly weren't looking to become people who were alienating our own community. That's not what we've ever done.

'I love where I live. I will never move from that area, unless something drastic happens and we certainly wouldn't want to alienate ourselves. So we are considering our options and what to do next.'

The Sky Sports pundit developed plans to build his five-bedroom grass covered house in the heart of rural Lancashire over three years and was granted planning permission in September.

Appearance-wise, there were indeed similarities with the dwelling occupied by the colourful children's TV characters, Tinky Winky, Dipsy, Laa-Laa and Po.

Almost all of the home above Bolton in Greater Manchester would have been built into the hillside with petal shaped rooms radiating from a central kitchen and fuelled by a 130ft wind turbine.

But the former England international waved bye, bye to the futuristic 8,000sq ft bunker on green belt land in the West Pennine moors over concerns of furore from locals.

However, the 37-year-old said he still wants his family, wife Emma and daughters Molly and Sophie, to live in a home completely fuelled by renewable energy.

He added: 'I can guarantee that the next house we live in will be all-electric. It will be as efficient as possible.'

But the former Manchester United defender who has previously self-built two homes said the design would be much more traditional.

He said: 'The windows and cavities will be the best level of insulation I can have and it will perform as a building- but it might look Victorian from outside.'

Neville's eco-friendly credentials also stretch to his choice of car as he drives a Vauxhall Ampera, a hybrid electric car.

He said: 'The vision of a footballer is that he drives a Ferrari. But in the 20 years I spent driving into the Manchester United car park I can only remember two or three. I'm driving a hybrid electric car that I've only put three tanks of petrol in since May. I'm proud of that.'Â
