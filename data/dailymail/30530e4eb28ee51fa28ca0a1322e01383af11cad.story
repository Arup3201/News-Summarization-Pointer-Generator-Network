This is the incredible moment a new Range Rover Sport went head-to-head against a Spitfire fighter plane in an engineering Battle of Britain.

The two technical masterpieces were pitted against each other in a unique off-road race at the Goodwood Aerodrome in Chichester, West Sussex.

And with a complex four-wheel drive system, the Range Rover immediately sped ahead of the Second World War plane.

Watch the race below...

Ready to go: A new Range Rover Sport went head-to-head against a Spitfire fighter plane in West Sussex

On your marks: The two technical masterpieces were pitted against each other in a unique off-road race 

Ready: The race was organised by FortyOneSix.com ahead of the Goodwood Festival of Speed

Starting off: The Range Rover immediately sped ahead of the World War Two plane as the race began

Up in the air: Shortly afterwards the 1945 aircraft - with its iconic 1,750bhp Merlin engine - reached 80mph and took off before easily passing the luxury off-roader

But shortly afterwards the 1945 
aircraft - with its iconic 1,750bhp Merlin engine - reached 80mph and 
took off before easily passing the luxury off-roader.

At
the one-mile point the Range Rover simply turned around and headed back
towards the finish line while the Supermarine Spitfire, piloted by Matt
Jones from the Boultbee Flight Academy, had a more difficult aerobatic 
turn.

Mike 
Cross, Jaguar Land Rover’s chief vehicle integrity engineer, was then 
back in the lead as he floored the car towards the chequered flag as the
Spitfire played catch-up.

Despite
being capable of 400mph, the 68-year-old Spitfire couldn’t quite catch 
the Range Rover Sport, which hit 130mph over the bumpy ground.

The amazing spectacle was organised by FortyOneSix.com ahead of this weekend’s Goodwood Festival of Speed, where the Range Rover Sport makes its UK dynamic debut.

Mr Cross said: ‘The team couldn’t resist the challenge laid down by FortyOneSix.com to race such a British icon.

‘It is always difficult to find traction from a standing start on grass, but the Range Rover Sport made a great launch off the line.

‘I was surprised by how bumpy the course was as I accelerated up to 130mph, and of course the other extreme challenge is to brake in time for the turn-around, but the car felt composed throughout the whole run.
