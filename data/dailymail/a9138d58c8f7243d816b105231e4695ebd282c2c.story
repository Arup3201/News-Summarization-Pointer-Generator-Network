The U.S. Department of Agriculture has approved what promises to be be the first commercialized biotech apple, a fruit that resists browning after it's been cut open or bruised.

The Obama administration's decision came as a surprise to many since the USDA rejected efforts by the organic industry and other critics of genetically modified plants – including environmental groups – to block the new fruit from the consumer marketplace.

The USDA's Animal and Plant Health
Inspection Service approved the planting of two GMO varieties grown by the Canadian company Okanagan Specialty Fruits Inc. on Friday.

The company triumphantly distributed a 30-second time lapse video that shows its new product alongside an ordinary apple as 24 hours tick by. One half-apple turns brown. The other remains yellow and appetizing.

Which would you rather eat? The Arctic Apple (below) doesn't brown after it's been cut open

The new fruit strain is identical to ordinary apples in every way but one: a single genetic manipulation that stops it from being 'oxidized' when it hits the open air

Okanagan plans to market the apples as Arctic Granny and
Arctic Golden, and says the apples are identical to their
conventional counterparts except the flesh of the fruit will
retain a fresh appearance even after it is sliced or bruised.

'All we've done is reduce the expression of a single enzyme, company president Neal Carter said in a statement. 'There are no novel proteins in Arctic fruit and their nutrition and composition is equivalent to their conventional counterparts.

He called the USDA approval 'a
monumental occasion.'

'It is the biggest milestone yet for us, and we can't wait
until they're available for consumers,' he said in a statement.

Carter said Arctic apples will first be available in late
2016 in small quantities, and it will take many years before the
apples are widely distributed.

He anticipates a 'slow but steady market introduction,' he said.

'Our focus is working with growers to get trees in the ground.'

The new Okanagan apples have drawn opposition from environmentalists and organic-only food advocates.

The
Organic Consumers Association, a lobby group funded by organic food and cosmetics companies, petitioned the USDA
to deny approval.

That group claims genetic changes that prevent browning
could be harmful to human health, and also alleges that pesticide levels on the
apples could be excessive.

OCA director Ronnie Cummins, a long-time purveyor of fright in food politics, said Friday that he plans to pressure food retailers and distributors not to sell the apples

'This whole thing is just another big experiment on humans
for no good reason,' he said.

The USDA said it had determined the apples were 'unlikely to
pose a plant pest risk to agriculture' and they are 'not likely
to have a significant impact on the human environment.'

The law
only allows the agency's decision to be based on its analysis of
the plant pest risk to agriculture or other plants in the United
States.

But there has been no scientifically documented and reproducible study that shows human health harms from GMOs.

The USDA has approved the planting of the Artic Granny and Arctic Golden (shown) varieties of the fruit, grown from seeds containing genes that have been pinpoint-modified in a laboratory

New plantings have been approved and the fruit could hit grocery stores as early as the fall of 2016

The Food and Drug Administration, which monitors new food technologies from a human health standpoint, has no mandatory
review process for genetically engineered foods. Okanagan is embracing a voluntary consultation with the agency, however.

The Center for Food Safety is another group that has a problem with GMOs. Named in a way that often causes name-confusion with the government's Center for Food Safety and Applied Nutrition, the organization is funded by donations from large foundations that often bankroll environmental groups.

In the case of GMOs, their millions have seen little impact. 

'We think there are some possible risks that were not
adequately considered,' the center's Doug Gurian-Sherman told Bloomberg.

But Okanagan said in a statement its apples have undergone
'rigorous review,' and are 'likely the most tested apples on the
planet.'

Apples have been the subject of intense food fears before. In 1989 a scandal erupted over Alar, a ripening agent made by the Uniroyal company that was sprayed on the fruit.

1989: '60 Minutes' demonized a ripening agent chemical sprayed on on apples called Alar; while a green group reaped a financial windfall, apple growers suffered from the overblown report

Growers were forced to stop using the chemical after a television expose that claimed it was harmful to children's health.

'The most potent cancer-causing agent in our food supply is a substance sprayed on apples to keep them on the trees longer and make them look better,' the late Ed Bradley intoned on 20/20.

'That's the conclusion of a number of scientific experts, and who is most at risk? Children who may someday develop cancer.'

For weeks apples sat rotting on grocers' shelves and thousands of fruit growers took a financial hit Nearly $10 million in federal aid went to compensate some of them, and hundreds of school districts banned apples from cafeteria lunches.

The Wall Street Journal later revealed that the name-and-shame scheme was a project of a Washington, D.C. public relations firm called Fenton Communications, which used it to benefit the Natural Resources Defense Council and other green groups.

A 1-900 phone number on the screen during the CBS News broadcast helped the environmental charity raise money thruogh toll-call fees.

The NRDC had already petitioned the Environmental Protection Agency to ban Alar, but the EPA had rejected its scientific evidence three weeks before the broadcast aired.

Green groups and organic-only food advocates had pushed hard for the techno-fruit to be rejected

@highlight

Two varieties of the 'Arctic Apple' are identical to ordinary fruit with the exception of a single gene splice that stops oxidation when it's cut open

Furor is reminiscent of 1989 'Alar-on-apples' scam that nearly collapsed the US apple industry in a fundraising scheme for an environmental group

New fruit could be on grocers' shelves as soon as the fall of 2016
