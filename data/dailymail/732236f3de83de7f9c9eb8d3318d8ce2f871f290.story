Lawsuit: Art enthusiast Sheikh Saud Bin Mohammed Al-Thani has been accused of amassing huge debts with auction houses

A sheikh who has spent more than £1billion on his art collection has denied accusations of being a 'serial defaulter' and amassing a pile of unpaid debts with some of the world’s top auction houses.

Saud Bin Mohammed Al-Thani - 'reputedly the world’s largest collector of objets d’art'- is being sued by dealers who say he has dishonoured a pledge to pay $19.7 million for a collection of ancient Greek coins sold at auction in New York in January.

Saud, 45, 'purchased nearly $20 million
 worth of coins from the Prospero Collection', regarded as the finest 
assortment of Archaic, Classical and Hellenistic Greek coins ever 
assembled, the High Court was told.

Although the dealers are still holding
 the coins they are 
insisting that the sheikh should be bound by his bid at auction.

The dealers’ QC, Jeffrey Gruder, likened Sheikh Saud to an 'inveterate gambler' who could not stop himself spending millions on objects of his desire before walking away from his obligations.

'He bids, wins and then doesn’t pay. One can only conclude that this is a person acting dishonourably and disreputably. He is bidding when he knows he’s not going to be able to pay,' the barrister claimed.

'Perhaps in a perverse way he enjoys the process of bidding. If one wants to be an amateur psychiatrist, maybe he is like an inveterate gambler who can’t stop himself gambling at Ladbrokes every day.'

Three dealers - A.H. Baldwin and Sons Ltd, Dmitry Markov, who trades as Dmitry Markov Coins and Medals, and N&M Numismatics LLC - say the sheikh has given no 'explanation or excuse' for his failure to pay, and Mr Gruder said he had left an 'extraordinary trail of unpaid debts'.

The case reached the High Court as their lawyers urged Mr Justice Haddon-Cave to continue an asset freezing injunction imposed on the sheikh, who is a cousin of the ruling emir of Qatar, on October 9.

Mr Gruder made hotly disputed allegations that Sheikh Saud’s total unpaid bill to worldwide auctioneers and art dealers includes £4.3 million owed to Bonhams, around $42 million owed to Sothebys, and various other sums owed to at least five other auction houses and art dealers.

'The fact that he is a member of the Qatar royal family is not relevant,' the QC went on - 'because if this is his conduct it doesn’t matter who he is.'

He repeatedly gave A.H. Baldwin the 'run-around' when they tried to pin him down about paying the $19.7 million bill, Mr Gruder alleged, offering to pay part of the outstanding cash in return for acquiring some of the coins.

'There were further meetings asking for the money, but basically nothing was paid,' he added.

The deadlock over payment became so entrenched that the UK ambassador to Qatar - and his opposite number in London - became involved.

'But, despite the best efforts of the two ambassadors, no payment has been forthcoming from the sheikh,' said the QC.

The sheikh rose to prominence after he spent  £1billion on art between 1996 and 2004.

In 2000, he splashed out more than £9m on 136 vintage photographs 
including great works by Man Ray and Alfred Stieglitz from the 
collection of Hamburg photographer Werner Bokelberg.

Other prominent purchases during this time include a £5m Fabergé egg 
bought at Christie's in New York in 2002, a £4.6m complete set of 
Audubon's Birds of America, and a £7.9m Roman marble statue, the Jenkins
 Venus.

In 2003 he beat London's V&A to purchase the £3m Clive of India 
flask. 'Sheikh Saud was a passionate art collector with a great eye,' 
said Georgina Adam, editor-at-large of The Art Newspaper.

In 2005 the Sheikh's spree came to a dramatic end when he was placed 
under house arrest in Qatar. He allegedly used a London dealer to fake 
invoices, misleading the Qatari government about the value of the items 
he was buying. He was sacked from the country's national culture 
council.

However, within a year he was spotted at auctions again. In 2008, he 
bought 90 per cent of the lots at a sale of Chinese art at Christie's. 
Last month, he was spotted at the European Fine Art Fair in Maastricht.

Mr Gruder also voiced concerns that the sheikh might be decamping from his London base now that his creditors have begun to gather, claiming that he left the UK earlier this month 'when the going began to get hot'.

But the sheikh’s QC, Stephen Rubin, brushed aside the suggestion that he might be fleeing the jurisdiction. He is currently in Doha - Qatar’s capital - 'where he is a member of the royal family,' said the barrister.

'He hasn’t slunk off in the night to Doha,' added Mr Rubin, noting that it was 'not unusual' for men in the sheikh’s position to 'go back to the middle east when the temperatures begin to drop' in the UK.

However, Mr Gruder claimed the sheikh had left 'almost a trail of destruction' behind him.

'He is a serial defaulter, as we have seen, in terms of auctions,' the QC added.

Denying those accusations on the sheikh’s behalf, Mr Rubin said he had been 'trying to pay”for the coins for the past nine months.

'There are no doubt timing issues which go to why he cannot pay at the moment, but that’s not a reason to make a freezing order against someone,' urged the barrister, who said the sheikh had been a faithful customer to leading art dealers over the years.

'He is a very well-known and internationally regarded art collector,' said Mr Rubin, who denied that the sheikh had accumulated a tide of unpaid debts.

Mr Rubin also attacked the case against the sheikh as 'obviously wrong', pointing out that the dealers had no basis for enforcing a contract of sale with him, as they had merely 'organised' the sale of coins owned by an 'unidentified' client of A.H. Baldwin and Sons.

The High Court heard that the Sheikh had given people the 'run around' and has tens of millions of debts with famous auction houses

The QC added: 'The way in which the American complaint is formulated is misconceived, in that it purports to be a claim for enforcement of a ‘contract of sale’, notwithstanding that the claimants were not on any view parties to any such contract with the sheikh.'

There was no evidence before the court on the value of the coins which the sheikh 'allegedly agreed to buy', added the barrister, who said that the dealers still have the coins and are free to find a buyer for them if they wish.

Mr Justice Haddon-Cave has now reserved his judgment in the case.
