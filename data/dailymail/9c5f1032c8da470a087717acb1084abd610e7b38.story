Wigan have agreed a £150,000 deal to sign Inverness top scorer Billy McKay.

The Northern Irish striker caught Malky Mackay's eye with five goals in his last five SPFL games as the Highlanders have made it five straight wins. And he flew south Wednesday morning to discuss terms and undergo a medical.

Caley Thistle boss John Hughes last week admitted defeat in his quest to keep the 26-year-old, who is out of contract in the summer, from returning to England.

With 10 goals for the season, Inverness had hoped to keep the former Leicester and Northampton striker until the summer in a quest to consolidate their push for Europe

But that hope proved in vain, however, when Wigan - locked in a Championship relegation battle - agreed to pay a minimal fee to secure his services now.

Inverness boss Hughes prepared fans for the worst last week when he said: 'Billy has been a wonderful player since I've come to the club.

'I think, if Billy does move on, he'll go away with the best wishes of everyone at Inverness and, if he does move on to something bigger and better, possibly you're looking at the English Championship, he deserves that.'
