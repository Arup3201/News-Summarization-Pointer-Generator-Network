Verdict: Gyash Uddin was found guilty of being involved in a sham marriage scam

A restaurant manager who arranged sham marriages and assisted bogus immigration visas has been told to expect a 'substantial' prison sentence after being found guilty by a jury.

Gyash Uddin, 39, who ran the Moja restaurant in Leighton Buzzard, Bedfordshire, had claimed he was not suspicious about the high number of marriages between his relatives from Bangladesh and Polish women who often worked in the restaurant.

The prosecution at Luton Crown Court maintained that Uddin was motivated to bring in relatives to the UK and then ensure they would be able to remain by marrying an EU national.

He and eight other people involved in the scam will be sentenced within the month.

Six had pleaded guilty and two were convicted by the jury alongside Uddin after a month long trial.

Uddin conspired with others to arrange sham marriages for those family members to European nationals who worked for him at Indian restaurants that he owned or ran.

Giving one example Will Noble 
prosecuting said that on December 13 2010, Dorota Wysocka and Mohammed 
Razul Miah attended Milton Keynes Registry Office and registered their 
'Notice of Marriage'.

Mr
Noble said 'The registrars noted that Mohammed Razul Miah and Dorota 
Wysocka were unable to communicate with one another due to a clear and 
obvious language barrier - neither spoke English. He couldn't speak 
Polish and she couldn't speak Bengali. The registrars were, as you can 
well imagine, understandably suspicious.'

In attendance was Gyash Uddin who purported to act as a Bangali interpreter.

'As well as an inability to communicate with one another, the registrar also noted that there was no interaction whatsoever between Wysocka and Miah during the process,' said the prosecutor who went on 'Due to concerns about the legitimacy of this proposed wedding, the registrars subsequently submitted a 'Suspicious Marriage Report' to the authorities asking them to investigate.'

In February 2010 Miah and Wysocka filled out a 'checklist of requirements' for the Registry Office in advance of the wedding indicating that the bride would be unaccompanied, there would be no bridesmaids, no music, no readings or poetry, no camcorders or photographers.

Then on February 19 2011, the couple attended the registry office in Leighton Buzzard, Bedfordshire and undertook a civil marriage ceremony and were formerly married.

A reception was held at the Moja restaurant but within half an hour of the meal finishing the bride and groom were back working in the kitchen.

Mr. Noble said the couple did not live together and Wysocka had a partner in Luton.

Uddin, 39, a father of five, from Ivy Road in Luton, Mohammed Razul Miah, 35, of the same address and Mohammed Dolon Miah, 29, of Spencer Road in Luton all pleaded not guilty to charges alleging that they conspired to facilitate a breach of immigration laws by non EU citizens.

The prosecution claim Mohammed Razul Miah is Mr Uddin's brother-in-law and Mohammed Dolan Miah is Mr Uddin's nephew. Uddin has British National status.

He was found guilty of eight charges of conspiring to facilitate a breach of immigration laws by non EU citizens and the two Miah's were each convicted of two similar charges, which they had denied.

Uddin was cleared of possessing articles for use in fraud.

Judge David Farrell QC remanded them in custody until all nine can be sentenced together. He told Uddin: 'A substantial sentence is inevitable. You were at the centre of these matters.'
