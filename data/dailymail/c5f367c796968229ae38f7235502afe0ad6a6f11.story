A plane was forced to make an emergency landing at New York's Kennedy airport this morning after striking a bird.

JetBlue Flight 671 took off from Westchester County Airport in White Plains at 9:05 a.m. en route to Palm Beach International Airport in Florida.

About 25 minutes after take off, the Airbus A320 collided with the bird, the Federal Aviation Administration said in a statement.

With 142 passengers on board, the pilots declared an emergency and decided to divert the flight to JFK as a precaution.

The plane safely landed there around 9:55 a.m., with no injuries.

Port Authority of New York and New Jersey spokesman Joe Pentangelo confirmed the JetBlue flight reported the bird strike Friday morning before landing at the airport, which is run by the agency.Â 

Customers were given the option of being put on another flight from JFK to Palm Beach or taken back to Westchester County.

Twitter user Chris Balduino posted pictures of the plane with a bird carcass lodged in the nose of it.

A second image showed what appeared to be a hole caused by the collision and the bird's blood streaked on the aircraft.

Balduino said in the tweet that his parents were on the fated flight and were at the airport waiting for a new plane.

The FAA said it will investigate the incident. The species of bird wasn't immediately identified.

The emergency landing has similarities to the 'Miracle on the Hudson' case on January 15, 2009, when a U.S. Airways flight struck a flock of Geese after departing La GUardia and pilot Sully Sullenberger made a flawless emergency landing in the Hudson River.

All 155 people on board survived.
