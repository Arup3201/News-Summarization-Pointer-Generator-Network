A yoga store worker is accused of beating her colleague to death with a foot-long metal bar that formed a merchandise stand at the shop.

Brittany Norwood, 29, is said to have chased 30-year-old Jayna Murray through the Bethesda store and also attacked her with a hammer, wrench, knife and peg used to hold up a mannequin.

The prosecution at the high-profile trial in Maryland has said that Miss Murray was dead in 15 minutes after 'a brutal and prolonged attack' that left the victim with hundreds of injuries.

State’s attorney John McCarthy told the jury at Montgomery County Circuit Court in Rockville, Maryland that Norwood also tried to strangle Murray at Lululemon Athletica store. 

Mr McCarthy showed the court a bloodstained piece of rope, adding: 'And you can see the hair, Jayna’s hair, hanging on the rope.'

At one point on that night, he said, 
an employee at the Apple Store next door heard a woman’s voice cry 
out,'Oh God, please help me'.

The worker pounded on the wall but did not take further action. On the morning of March 12 this year, police discovered Miss Murray dead on the floor of the store and Norwood tied up in the bathroom.

The accused would later tell
detectives she had been attacked by masked men who slipped into the 
store after closing time in order to rob them. Police at first considered Norwood a victim before their suspicions were aroused.

The prosecution claim that Norwood staged a robbery and tossed 
mops, brooms and chairs around the shop.

She also cut the victim's trousers to make it appear that the young woman had been sexually assaulted.

Mr McCarthy suggested that she used a pair of men’s shoes to track blood 
around the store - trying to make it appear that a large man had been 
there.

An autopsy revealed that Miss Murray suffered 322 injuries, 107 of which were defensive wounds inflicted as she tried to 
use parts of her body, including her hands and forearms, to shield 
herself.

The medical examiner who performed the autopsy 
said she had never seen so many defensive wounds, the prosecution said.

Mr McCarthy said: 'On March the 11th of this year, she 
savagely ended the life of Jayna Murray.

'Today we begin
the process of holding her accountable for the crime she committed... first-degree, premeditated murder.'

The prosecution called Miss Murray an 'extraordinary 
young woman' pursuing two masters' degrees from Johns Hopkins University
at the time of her death.

Norwood's defence lawyer Douglas Wood
said that a 'horrific' fight broke out between the two co-workers.

Mr Wood said: 'Ladies and gentlemen, Brittany Norwood lost it. There’s no doubt about that. She lost it. She lost control.'

He claimed that a fight between the women got out of hand and that Norwood never intended to murder her colleague.

Norwood’s defence has claimed that she lost her mind that night.

Mr Wood said: 'Things that Brittany Norwood did after this were totally inept.

'They show someone, we submit, who got 
involved in a nightmarish situation, a nightmare, and had this sort of 
imagination, or this explanation of what happened, and it was full of 
holes because there was no premeditation, deliberation and willfulness.'

The families of both women, including their 
parents, were present in the courtroom. The trial is expected to last around eight days.

In the state of Maryland, premeditated murder carries the possible sentence of life with no chance for parole.

Second-degree murder carries a maximum of 30 years in prison with a chance of release after 15 years.

The trial continues.
