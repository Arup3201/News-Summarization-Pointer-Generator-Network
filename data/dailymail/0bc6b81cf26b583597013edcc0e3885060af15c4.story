The ex-Commons clerk who clashed with John Bercow today took a thinly-veiled swipe at the Speaker.

Lord Rogers, who was allegedly told to 'f*** off' by Mr Bercow before retiring early this year, was named Parliamentarian of the Year at a glitzy Westminster awards lunch.

Collecting his award from Home Secretary Theresa May, Lord Rogers appeared to hint at Mr Bercow's eventual departure from his role, hoping 'common sense and good governance will prevail before very long'.

Lord Rogers was named Parliamentarian of the Year, where he used his speech to make a thinly-veiled gibe at John Bercow's expense

Speaker John Bercow, who is said to have clashed with Lord Rogers, was in the Commons this morning

Politicians and journalists gathered at the Savoy Hotel this afternoon for the 271 Parliamentarian of the Year Awards.

Winners included minister of the year Steve Webb, politician of the year Alex Salmond and William Hague, who was given a lifetime achievement award.

But eyebrows were raised by Lord Rogers gibe at Mr Bercow, who had been invited to the awards but was otherwise engaged.

He stood down as Clerk of the Commons – the most powerful official in Parliament – after relations became strained with Mr Bercow.

Today Lord Rogers, who now sits in the House of Lords, told the audience at the awards bash that Parliament had been through a difficult period.

In an apparent suggestion that Mr Bercow's days in his job might be numbered, he added: 'I've every confidence common sense and good governance will prevail before very long.'

The room of MPs, peers and reporters cheered. But Mr Bercow's place setting at the lunch remained empty throughout.

Mrs May hosted the awards, but struggled at times with technology as the projector used during her speech failed her

During her speech Mrs May used a series of photographs to poke fun at Islington, the constituency of Labour MP Emily Thornberry who landed herself in hot water last week for appearing to sneer at working class voters

Organisers say he had been expected to attend, after he had chaired questions in the Commons this morning.

But a spokesman for the Speaker said the invitation had been declined 'several weeks ago because of a prior engagement'.

Awarding the prize to Lord Rogers, Spectator editor Fraser Nelson said: 'Our winner knows more about the Commons and its history than any other living soul – he has, quite literally, written the book on parliament.

'After the expenses scandal and the demise of Speaker Martin, it was our winner who plotted the restoration of parliamentary grittiness which has been wonderfully evident in the past few years.

'He did so with impeccable impartiality. He did so with humour, scholarship, charm, a flinty adherence to democracy and the most splendid mutton chop whiskers in Westminster.'

Other prize winners included politician of the year Alex Salmond (left) and William Hague, who was given a lifetime achievement award

Douglas Carswell, who this year became Ukip's first elected MP after defecting from the Tories, was named 'insurgent' of the year 

During his acceptance speech, Mr Salmond produced a handkerchief from his pocket bearing a St George's Cross

Mr Salmond said he was 'honoured' to receive the award for a second time, having previously been recognised in 2011 after the SNP's landslide win in the Scottish elections

Mr Bercow sparked a major row with MPs earlier this year when it emerged he hoped to replace Lord Rogers with Australian Carol Mills the £200,000 post.

In the Commons, Tory MP Michael Fabricant claimed Mr Bercow had sworn at Lord Rogers.

In a debate in July, he said: 'Now, we do not know why he has chosen to retire early, though his working environment, behind closed doors, has not always been easy, as those in the know have already alluded to.

'In that respect, despite Sir Robert having studied Anglo Saxon at Oxford, being told at least once in front of others to f*** off by you, Mr Speaker, would not have encouraged him to stay.'

At the ceremony Mr Salmond said he was 'honoured' to receive the award for a second time, having previously been recognised in 2011 after the SNP's landslide win in the Scottish elections.

The former SNP leader said: 'This has been a momentous year for Scotland and, while the Yes campaign may not have won in the referendum, there is no doubt that Scotland has been changed utterly.

'With the SNP now the third biggest party in the UK with more than twice as many members as the Lib Dems, and support for the party surging in the polls, there is a determination in Scotland to ensure that real progress is delivered.'
