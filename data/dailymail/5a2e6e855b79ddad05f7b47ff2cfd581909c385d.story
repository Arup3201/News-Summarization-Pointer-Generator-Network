Olympic cyclist Dani King is in hospital after puncturing a lung in a crash caused by a pothole.

The 23-year-old gold medallist was riding near her home in Cardiff.

One of her team went down after hitting the water-filled pothole, bringing down a number of others including Miss King, who won team pursuit gold at the London Olympics in 2012.

She suffered a collapsed lung and five broken ribs.

Her agent Steve Fry said she was in a ‘fair bit of pain’ and called on authorities to improve roads.

‘It was a totally routine ride that Dani has done hundreds of times before,’ he said.

‘There was a puddle across the full width of the road, it was one of those freak things that in the middle of that puddle was a hole.

‘A rider to her side went down and fell into her. It was obvious she was injured, and quite badly so, and almost immediately she was taken to hospital by ambulance. Several other riders were also hospitalised. We are in the hands of the medical professionals so we don’t know how long she will be in hospital.

‘It happened on a B-road between Merthyr Tydfil and Quaker’s Yard,’ he added.

‘The injuries are clearly painful and serious and we can only hope she gets better soon. It’s too early to say yet when she’ll be back in training and competing. It’s time local authorities started spending more money on repairing roads to ensure things like this don’t keep happening. We’d like to see £10 per head of population spent on . . . maintenance of paths and roads.’

British Cycling said: ‘We wish Dani a speedy recovery . . . There is much more to be done to improve conditions.’

After the crash on Thursday Miss King tweeted: ‘Crashed whilst out training yesterday resulting in five broken ribs and a collapsed lung. Being looked after by the amazing NHS ICU in Wales.’

Her Olympic team-mates sent messages of support.

Laura Trott, at the Track World Cup in Mexico, said: ‘Sending lots of best wishes to @DaniKing1 this morning after a horrible crash’.

And Joanna Rowsell said: ‘Sending lots of hugs to @DaniKing1 and best wishes for a speedy recovery’.

This week, a study by LV Road Rescue found as many as one in six drivers have had their car damaged by potholes in the past year.
