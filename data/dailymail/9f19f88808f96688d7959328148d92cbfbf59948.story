Curiosity has taken its first sniff of Martian air as engineers begin testing all of its scientific instruments.

The robot sucked the air into its big Sample Analysis at Mars (Sam) instrument, which is designed to reveal the concentration of different gases on the red planet.

It is hoped the instrument will be able to find tiny traces of methane, a short lived gas, in the atmosphere.

As it needs to be replenished, this would give clues to life on the red planet.

Researchers will use a super-sensitive analysis machine to search for it.

'When Sam is at its best it can measure various parts per trillion of 
methane, and the expected amounts based on measurements taken from orbit
around Mars and from Earth telescopes should be in the 10 to a few 10s 
of parts per billion,' said Curiosity deputy principal scientist Joy Crisp.

The gas has recently been observed by satellite and by Earth telescopes.

It is the first time that the chemistry of the atmosphere has been tested from the surface of the planet since the Viking landers in the 1970s.

It found CO2 is the main component of Martian air.

However, Nasa says analysis may take a little more time.

'It's so early in the use of Sam, which is a complicated instrument, and we have to sort through the data,' said Crisp.

Nasa engineers have also begun testing the rover's robotic arm.

Nasa also released new engineering pictures showing the location of Curiosity's robot arm, which has five joints.

'We will be putting the arm through a range of motions and placing it at important 'teach points' that were established during Earth testing, such as the positions for putting sample material into the inlet ports for analytical instruments," said Daniel Limonadi of NASA's Jet Propulsion Laboratory in Pasadena.

'These activities are important to get a better understanding for how the arm functions after the long cruise to Mars and in the different temperature and gravity of Mars, compared to earlier testing on Earth.'Â 

Since the Mars Science Laboratory spacecraft placed Curiosity inside Mars' Gale Crater on Aug. 5, it has driven a total of 358 feet (109 meters).

The drives have brought it about one-fourth of the way from the landing site, named Bradbury Landing, to a location selected as the mission's first major science destination, Glenelg.

'We knew at some point we were going to need to stop and take a week or so for these characterization activities,' said JPL's Michael Watkins, Curiosity mission manager.

'For these checkouts, we need to turn to a particular angle in relation to the sun and on flat ground.

'We could see before the latest drive that this looked like a perfect spot to start these activities.'

The arm can be extended to pick up samples from the Martian surface
