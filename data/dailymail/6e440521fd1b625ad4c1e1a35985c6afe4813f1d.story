Retail therapy can cure many an ailment, and though the Romneys are multi-billionaires, they apparently find their source of comfort in the filled aisles of Costco.

The former Republican presidential candidate and his wife were pictured shopping at their local bulk warehouse near their home in La Jolla, California on Tuesday.

The couple stocked up on bottled water, pretzels, fruit snacks, Dixie cups and paper towels. They also seemed to be preparing for Christmas as their carts had a few rolls of gift wrap and a toy car that will likely be a present for one of their 18 grandchildren.

Unloading: Mitt and Ann Romney were pictured shopping at their local bulk warehouse near their home in La Jolla, California on Tuesday

Supplies: The couple stocked up on bottled water, pretzels, fruit snacks, Dixie cups and paper towels

No help needed: The former candidate and his wife were by themselves during the shopping trip, where they apparently got some Christmas supplies for their brood

Frequent shoppers: The Romneys have spoken repeatedly about their affinity for Costco

Overlooking no details, they even remembered to pick up a box of Bisquik for pancakes on Christmas morning.

The Romney's fondness for the discount membership club is no secret, as they frequently talked about their trips to Costco during the campaign trail.

Cynical political analysts cried foul, saying that the they were trying to use their mentions of the budget store as a way to help lessen the public perception that the former governor was out of touch with the 'common man' because of his great wealth.

The family's affinity for the store seems genuine, however, as Ann repeatedly boasted that it was the easiest- and most fiscally responsible- way to feed her large family.

Blending in: Mitt and Ann were both dressed down, though Ann accessorized her look with a hot pink scarf

No driver needed: The couple arrived in their own Audi SUV

What do we need? They both sported sunglasses during the visit, though Mitt decided to keep his on the entire time and Ann took them off while inside the store

Plan of attack: Ann Romney has previously said that she always thinks about what is the most strategic way to shop in the store before going inside because it can be overwhelming

When the couple's five sons, their wives and all of their children come over for dinner, the total number of Romneys at the various dinner tables can easily add up to 30 people.

During an interview on the Rachael Ray show during the campaign, Ann told the celebrity chef how she always has her route mapped out before she goes in the store.Â 

'Wholesale shops are big, you have to go with a game plan before you start,' she said at the time.

Santa at work: Romney bought several children's toys during his visit, presumably for some of his 18 grandchildren

Spoiler alert: One of the Romney clan can expect a remote controlled car for Christmas

Trying to go unnoticed: Mitt kept to himself during the visit, but in spite of his hopes, the hat and glasses did not keep alert shoppers from noticing him

During that appearance, Ann talked a great deal about how she buys the store's produce- both fresh and frozen- and stocks up on desserts.

But the pictures from their Tuesday trip to the California store reveal that she and Mitt focused more on the non-perishables this time.

It looks like in addition to picking 
up some Christmas presents for the kids, the couple may have also gotten
a puffy black jacket for Mitt, as one was seen hanging off the side of 
his cart.

He tried to blend
in during the trip, and was dressed casually in khaki shorts, a navy 
athletic shirt a baseball cap and sneakers, but his black sunglasses 
inside the store may have been a bit conspicuous.

Ann
seemed relaxed but made less of an effort to blend in with the masses 
as she accessorized her black leisurewear with a hot pink scarf.

New attire: Mitt appears to have bought a puffy black winter jacket even though the California temperatures do no require one quite yet

Casual gear: Romney has not announced many plans for his life post-campaign, though he did just rejoin the board of directors of Marriott Hotels

About their business: The couple have led a low-key life since the election ended in November

Clean up: Aside from one 'exit interview', Romney has kept quiet as many commentators speculated on the demise of his presidential bid

Healthy: V8 juice drinks and Fruit Snacks were among the treats that they bought

Doing his part: Mitt returns the carts after he and Ann emptied their loot

The former presidential candidate has laid low ever since he lost the election, relaxing with his family in La Jolla, taking time out to see the latest edition of the Twilight saga and accompanying his grandchildren to Disneyland.

Romney briefly popped back up on the political radar when he had lunch with President Obama in the White House last week, though he did not speak to reporters after the meeting and only one joint photo was released.

As of Monday, Mitt officially has an income again, since he announced yesterday that he will be re-joining the board of directors of the hotel chain, Marriott.

Board members receive an annual salary of $60,000 as well as $110,000 in company stock as compensation for their efforts.

Mitt served on the board of the company from 1993 to 2002 when he resigned to serve as governor of Massachusetts.

He re-joined the board in 2009 and resigned again in January 2011 as the campaign heated up with the seemingly-unending process of Republican primaries.
