Oracle yesterday accused Google in court of knowingly stealing a key piece of technology to build into the search giant's Android smartphone operating system.

Michael Jacobs, for Oracle, drew an unflattering portrait of Google's top executives regard for intellectual property in a battle over the mind-numbing minutiae of computer coding.

'We will prove to you from beginning to end ... that Google knew it was using someone else's property,' Mr Jacobs told the San Francisco, California court.

The showdown centres on allegations 
that Android infringes on the patents and copyrights of Java, a 
programming technology that Sun Microsystems began developing 20 years 
ago.

Oracle, a business software maker 
based in Redwood Shores, acquired the rights to Java when it bought Sun 
Microsystems for $7.3billion (£4.6billion) in January 2010.

Google, the Mountain View, 
California-based Internet search leader, has steadfastly denied Oracle's
allegations since the lawsuit was filed seven months after the Sun deal
closed.

The impasse has left it to a 12-member jury to resolve the dispute in a trial scheduled to last as long as 10 weeks.

U.S. District Judge William Alsup 
devoted most of yesterday's session to picking the jury, leaving only 
enough time for Oracle to lay out the framework for its case.

Oracle is seeking hundreds of millions
of dollars in damages and an injunction to force Google to pay 
licensing fees or find an alternative to Java to keep its Android system
running.

At one point in the lawsuit, Oracle estimated it might be owed as much as $6.1billion (£3.8billion).

But Judge Alsup has whittled the case 
down in a way that has substantially lowered the size of the potential 
payout if Google loses.

In a sign of how far apart the two 
sides are, Google last month said it would be willing to pay $2.8million
(£1.8million) plus a tiny percentage of its future revenue if the jury 
decides Android infringed on two Java patents.

Google hasn't publicly estimated what 
it thinks its liability might be if the jury decides Android violates, 
as Oracle alleges, 37 Java programming copyrights.

The copyright disagreement - the most 
important point of the case - will be covered in the first phase of the 
trial followed by the patent dispute.

If necessary, a third phase will be devoted to how much money Google owes Oracle.

Much of the evidence presented during 
the trial will delve into highly technical matters likely to only be 
comprehensible to programming geeks and patent-law specialists.

However, there may be dramatic 
interludes that lift a veil on the inner workings of two of the world's 
most influential technology companies.

The intrigue will include testimony 
from the two companies' multibillionaire CEOs, Oracle's Larry Ellison 
and Google's Larry Page.

Oracle indicated yesterday that it could call Mr Ellison to the stand as early as today.

Several other Silicon Valley 
luminaries, including former Google CEO Eric Schmidt and former Sun 
Microsystems CEO Jonathan Schwartz, are also on the list of potential 
witnesses.

Mr Jacobs focused much of his opening 
statement on excerpts from internal emails suggesting Google knew it 
needed to pay licensing fees to use some of the Java technology that 
went into Android, a project that began in earnest in 2005 when Google 
bought a startup run by Andy Rubin.

The first phone running on Android 
didn't go on sale until October 2008, about 15 months before Oracle 
bought Sun Microsystems and stepped up the attempts to make Google pay 
up for the Java technology.

Oracle cited an October 2005 email 
from Mr Rubin to Mr Page as an early sign that Google realised it 
probably would have to pay Sun for using Java in Android.

Mr Rubin wrote: 'My proposal is that we take a license that specifically grants the right for us to Open Source our product.'

Mr Jacobs pointed to a May 2006 email 
from Mr Schmidt to Mr Rubin as an indication Google knew it might need 
to find other solutions for Android if an agreement with Sun was not 
reached.

'How are we doing on the Sun deal?' Mr
Schmidt asked in his message. 'Its (sic) it time to develop a non-Java 
solution to avoid dealing with them?'

By August 2010, Google still hadn't 
been able to find any satisfactory alternatives to Java, according to an
email from Google engineer Tim Lindholm to Mr Rubin.

'We have been over a bunch of these, 
and think they all suck,' wrote Mr Lindholm, who worked at Sun 
Microsystems before joining Google.

'We conclude that we need to negotiate a license for Java under the terms we need.'

The lack of a licensing agreement 
ultimately didn't deter Google, Mr Jacobs told the jury, because the 
company realised it needed a mobile software system to preserve its 
digital search-and-advertising empire as more sophisticated phones 
enabled people to surf the Internet away from their desktop computers.

Java provided Google with a 
springboard into mobile computing because 6million software programmers 
were already familiar with the technology and could easily create 
applications that would run on Android, Mr Jacobs said.

Although Google doesn't charge device 
makers to use Android, the company makes money from some of the mobile 
advertising and mobile applications sold on the system.

Google has said its mobile advertising
revenue now exceeds $2.5billion, but it hasn't specified how much of 
that money comes from Android-powered devices.
