Jesse Lingard has made sure new manager Louis van Gaal knows all about him by impressing on Manchester United's pre-season tour to America. The Dutch boss is putting the finishing touches to his plans for the season but what will he have at his disposal if he decides to keep the 21-year-old Lingard?

He's looked good this summer...

Yes, Lingard has appeared in several of the pre-season tour games, demonstrating his versatility by impressing in both the attacking midfield position and the right-wing back role. Usually, Warrington-born Lingard plays from the wide positions or as a second forward. He is a very capable finisher.

So has he got a chance of being involved this season?

Now 21, Lingard will soon be facing a decision - if Louis van Gaal doesn't make it for him - as to whether he should bide his time at Old Trafford or move on to guarantee regular football.

Where have I seen him before?

He enjoyed successful loan spells at Birmingham and Brighton last season in the Championship but he was also the star man on United's tour of Asia and Australia last summer, finishing as the top-scorer.

Why wasn't he handed a chance by David Moyes?

The tricky fixture list - United faced Chelsea, Liverpool and Manchester City in the opening weeks - saw Moyes revert to more experienced names in his bid to get off to a promising start. After that plan backfired, Moyes found himself in a scenario where every match became hugely pressurised and the Scot refused to hand Lingard an opportunity. He was in line for a start in the Capital One Cup but United were drawn against Liverpool and Moyes was anxious to get a result by that stage.

Where would he fit in under Van Gaal?

With wingers out of fashion in Van Gaal’s new 3-5-2 system, Lingard could be in trouble at United but he may feel he can operate in the hole behind two forwards or as a frontman himself, although his side is well-stocked in those positions. His best chance may be as a right wing-back, where he played against Real Madrid, offering competition to Rafael and Antonio Valencia. The Dutchman will outline his plans to the United squad at the end of this week in a host of meetings in Manchester.

Where could he go?

Plenty of Championship sides, including Brighton, are monitoring Lingard with regards to a loan. Fulham are understood to have had an approach over a permanent move rebuffed in January.
