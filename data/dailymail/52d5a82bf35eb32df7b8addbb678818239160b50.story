The Boston Marathon bombing and a rise in terrorist activity has contributed to the U.S. falling outside the world's 100 most peaceful countries, according to new data.

The new ranking now leaves the U.S. trailing countries Benin, Haiti and Bangladesh, which are placed 99, 98 and 97 respectively.

The nation's slip to place 101 out of 162 nations is revealed in the Global Peace IndexÂ  - an annual report which ranks countries according to their 'absence of violence'.

A new study shows the U.S. has fallen outside the 100 most peaceful countries partly due to terrorist activity

The Boston Marathon bombings on April 15 last year 
caused outrage when three people were killed and 264 injured after two 
pressure cooker bombs were exploded during the city race

The report said the attacks on the city by the 'Islamist-inspired terrorists' were the most shocking attacks on U.S. soil since September 11.

1. Iceland - 11892. Denmark - 11933. Austria - 12004. New Zealand - 12365. Switzerland - 12586. Finland - 12977. Canada - 13068. Japan - 13169. Belgium - 135410. Norway - 1371

153. North Korea - 3.071154. Pakistan - 3.107155. Democratic Republic of Congo - 3.213156. Central African Republic - 3.331157. Sudan - 3.362158. Somalia - 3.368159. Iraq - 3.377160. South Sudan - 3.397161. Afghanistan - 3.416162. Syria - 3.650

'Furthermore, the intelligence and security services have disrupted and prevented a number of plots over the past decade.'

As a result, the nation's score for terrorist activity placed it within the bottom quartile of the assessed nations.

In the days following the bombing, Chechen brothers Dzhokhar and Tamerlan Tsarnaev were identified as suspects and shortly afterwards, a firefight and manhunt ensued before Tamerlan was killed and Dzhokhar arrested.

However, the nation's high level of terrorist threats were not the only factor responsible for the fall.

The nation's high levels of 'militarisation' also contributed.

This
 included the population's relative ease of access to small arms, its 
massive nuclear and heavy weapons arsenal, and its weaponry export and 
imports.

Unsurprisingly,
 Syria has firmly rooted itself to the bottom of the rankings with large
 amounts of displaced people, numerous types of violence, political 
instability, criminality, terrorist activity and deaths from conflicts.

Meanwhile,
 mostly Scandinavian and European countries topped the rankings, with 
Iceland, Denmark, Austria, New Zealand and Switzerland leading the way.
