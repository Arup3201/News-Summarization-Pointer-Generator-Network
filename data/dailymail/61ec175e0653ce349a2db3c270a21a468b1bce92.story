An obese dachshund has managed to lose a whopping 43 pounds after spending a year on a strictly-controlled diet plan. 

Dennis, whose weight peaked at an unbelievable 56 pounds just over a year ago, also had to undergo surgery in order to remove all of the excess skin left behind after he dropped the weight.

The canine companion first starting piling on the pounds after being left in the care of his owner's uncle, who fed him a dangerous combination of human food and fatty dog treats.

Piling on the pounds: Dennis the dachshund weighed a whopping 56 pounds when he was at his heaviest just over a year ago

Food fan: Despite his strict diet plan, Dennis still loves food - and even 'does a dance' when he knows it's time to eat

But now, after more than 12 months of dieting, Dennis is back to a healthy weight - and his owner, Brooklyn Burton, from West Columbus, Ohio, says she couldn't be more delighted with the results of her dog's health-focused regime.

'He now can go up and down the steps,' she told local news station WSYX.

'He never used to be able to do that. Run, even faster. He thinks he rules the house.'

But Dennis hasn't completely lost his love of good food - and can always be relied upon to be particularly enthusiastic and energetic at dinner time. 

'He loves when it's chow time, he does a little dance,' Ms Burton joked. 'Right before he gets his food.'

The devoted pet owner credits an intensive exercise program and incredibly strict diet plan as being the main reasons behind her dog's dramatic weight loss - and she hopes that other people will be able to find inspiration in what she has done for her canine, and repeat the same success with their own animals.

'We should not be feeding dogs people food,' she explained. 

'And [we shouldn't] be over-feeding them and giving them excessive amounts of treats. 

'Just like humans, they need diet and exercise in order to live a healthy life.' 

According to animal experts, a dachshund of Dennis' size should weigh between 13 and 16 pounds, meaning the young dog's previous weight could have left him at risk of serious illness and - in the worst case - death.

Fellow fitness fanatic: A seven-year-old dachshund called Obie hit the headlines last year after losing an impressive 50 pounds

Although Dennis has made remarkable progress during the last year, his weight loss journey is far from over. 

The slimmed-down dog is set to undergo another round of surgery this month, in order to remove additional excess skin from his shoulders and hind area. 

Dennis is not the first dachshund to stun the world with such an impressive weight loss story. 

In October last year, a seven-year-old sausage dog named Obie, hit the headlines after he lost more than 50 pounds in just over a year.

Much like Dennis, Obie's unhealthy weight gain came as a result of too many treats, particularly scraps from the table, and too little exercise. 

But after a lengthy rehabilitation - and a tummy tuck procedure - Obie now weighs a healthy 27 pounds, and has even released a 2015 calendar in celebration of his weight loss.
