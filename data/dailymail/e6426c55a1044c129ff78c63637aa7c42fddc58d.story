Liverpool will transfer the Hillsborough Memorial into storage to avoid damage while they begin work on the expansion of the main stand at Anfield.

Families of the 96 people killed in the tragedy held a private service at the memorial before it is removed for up to 18 months.

The club began their work in December and ultimately hope to take the stadium's capacity to 58,000.

A smaller, temporary plaque plaque was unveiled on the wall of the Centenary Stand, which will remain in place for the duration of the building work.

The Eternal Flame that normally resides at the memorial has been transferred to Liverpool Anglican Cathedral.

The club's considerate move typifies the sensitivity with which they have, and continue to, treat the disaster, in which 96 people died due to overcrowding at Sheffield Wednesday's Hillsborough Stadium.

Margaret Aspinall, Chair of the Hillsborough Family Support Group, said: 'I'd like to thank the Club for involving us from the beginning of the expansion project and taking our views into account for the future of our Hillsborough Memorial.

'We decided to put it into safe storage during the construction period of the Main Stand expansion and also decided on the design of the temporary memorial so fans can continue to pay their respects.

'I'd also like to thank Canon Myles Davies for attending today and agreeing to look after the eternal flame at the Cathedral.'
