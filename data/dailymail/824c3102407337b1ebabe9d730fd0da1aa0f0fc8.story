Spanish police have arrested a man for allegedly throwing a banana at Barcelona defender Dani Alves during a football match at the weekend.

The arrest comes as it was revealed the anti-racism campaign which followed Alves picking the banana up and eating it had been planned by footballers before the racist abuse even took place.

So common is racial abuse for black footballers in Spain, players had agreed one of them would pick up and eat the next banana thrown at them during a match.

Brazilian international Alves just happened to be the first victim - and ate the banana during the match at Villarreal on Sunday.

His actions were backed by footballers 
and celebrities across the world as support flooded in from fellow 
professionals posting pictures of themselves with bananas on to the 
internet.

Police confirmed 26-year-old David Campayo Lleo was arrested, with Spanish media reporting he had been fired from his role on the coaching staff of one of the club's youth teams.

Villarreal would not confirm nor deny the reports about Campayo Lleo's role with the club when questioned about their authenticity by The Associated Press.

Villarreal has banned Campayo Lleo from the team's El Madrigal Stadium for life.

Campayo Lleo faces up to three years in prison if found guilty of charges related to racist provocation.

The news comes as Spanish newspaper AS reported the anti-racism campaign had been planned after Alves and teammate Neymar had been abused at Espanyol in March.

According to the report, the pair contacted marketing firm Loducca following the earlier incident.

Guga Ketzer, partner at the marketing company, told AS: 'The idea was for Neymar to eat the banana, but in the end it was Alves, and that works just the same.

'The best way to beat prejudice is to take the sting out of the racist action so it isnâ€™t repeated.

'We created #somostodosmacacos and #weareallmonkeys, with the gesture of eating a banana, and it has been turned into a movement.'

Alves meanwhile has hit out at Spain 
for being 'very backward' in its approach towards racism and believes 
the fan who hurled a banana on the pitch should be publicly shamed.

'If I could, I would put a photo of the fan on the internet so that he would be shamed,' Alves told Brazil's Radio Globo.

'There is racism against foreigners. They sell the country as being first world but in certain things they are very backward.'

Alves admitted he did not expect his actions to receive so much attention.

'I have been surprised by everyone's support. I did it without thinking. The world has evolved and we must evolve with it.'

FIFA president Sepp Blatter was among those who backed the player and tweeted that racism cannot be tolerated.

Alves said that the world governing body should be more proactive.

'FIFA must concentrate on things more important than La Masia. They need to give their attention to more serious things,' he said, referring to the recent verdict that Barcelona were guilty of breaching regulations over the transfer of underage players.
