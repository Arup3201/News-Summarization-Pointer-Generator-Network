He was the Beatle behind hits including Here Comes The Sun and Something, described by Frank Sinatra as one of the greatest love songs ever.

But George Harrison always resented living in the songwriting shadow of Paul McCartney and John Lennon. Now newly released Cabinet Office papers reveal that Harrison turned down the ‘insensitive’ offer of an OBE – after McCartney was awarded a knighthood.

The documents, obtained by The Mail on Sunday under Freedom of Information laws, reveal that Harrison, then 56, declined the chance to receive an OBE in the New Year Honours List of 2000.

McCartney had been awarded a knighthood in 1997. Those who knew Harrison said he would have regarded the lesser honour as ‘an insult’.

The OBE was suggested by the Department for Culture, Media and  Sport to recognise his four decade-long career in showbusiness.

But the citation for Harrison did not highlight his creative contribution to The Beatles’ success, stating simply: ‘He was a member of a band that many people would say is the best thing that Britain has ever produced, and possibly the best in the world, The Beatles.’

Journalist Ray Connolly, who knew The Beatles, said Harrison would have regarded the offer of the OBE as a snub. ‘Whoever it was who decided to offer him the OBE and not the knighthood was extraordinarily insensitive,’ he said. ‘George would have felt insulted – and with very good reason.’

On December 30, 1999, Harrison  was attacked in his Oxfordshire mansion by an knife-wielding intruder who punctured his lung and left him with  head injuries. He survived but died  of cancer in 2001.

The Beatles were each awarded the MBE in 1965 – John Lennon later sent his back as a peace protest. Sir Paul, Harrison’s widow Olivia and son Dhani were unavailable for comment last night.
