This is the horrifying moment a shopkeeper is repeatedly stabbed during a raid by ski-mask wearing raiders.

Gareth Fawkner, 29, and his younger brother Rocky, 18, wore frightening disguises as they burst into a One Stop in Henley Green, Coventry. 

The violent raid was captured on CCTV cameras fitted at the store and shows Rocky leaping over the counter and knifing the terrified worker in the back and shoulder.

The vicious onslaught only comes to an end when his brother, who is also shown brandishing a knife, hauls him away. 

The pair, who were helped by another raider, then stuffed cigarettes and alcohol into a duvet cover and made off on a moped.

But they were captured when detectives analysed the digital CCTV footage and spotted defects on the clothes which eventually led to the Fawkner brothers being identified. 

They were both jailed for six years each when they appeared at Warwick Crown Court after they were found guilty of robbery.

The court heard Gareth Fawkner committed the raid while on licence for an armed robbery in 2010.

He was jailed for five years and four months in July 2010 when he attacked staff and stole cigarettes and alcohol from a Co-Op store in Walsgrave, Coventry.

Both denied the robbery along with another in Arena Park in Coventry eight days earlier. The shopkeeper is understood to have made a full recovery.

The court heard they threatened a store manager and security guard with knives when their request to 'test ride' a mountain bike at the Decathlon store was refused.

After threatening the staff they made off with a £430 mountain bike.

Police managed to track down the brothers after close examination of the footage of the One Stop raid. 

A jacket worn by Rocky Fawkner had a small tear on the side and when police later raided their family home in Wood End in the West Midlands, a top with the same defect was found in a kitchen cupboard.

Meanwhile Gareth Fawkner wore a distinctive blue and white tracksuit which officers discovered he had worn six weeks earlier when he was arrested on suspicion of assault.

Officers searched an address linked to him, also in Wood End, and uncovered a blue hoodie from a bin which featured the same white trim captured on the CCTV footage.

Police also found a pair of Nike trainers worn during the robbery hidden in a tumble dryer.

Body 'mapping' experts also assessed the robbers caught on camera and concluded they matched the size and build of the Fawkners.

Speaking after the case, Detective Inspector Nick Dale, of West Midlands Police, said: 'This case highlights the futility of many crimes and people risking long spells behind bars for very little gain.

'The Fawkner brothers have rightly been handed significant custodial sentences: they used a disproportionate level of violence, far more than was needed to achieve their aims and yet all they got away with was a mountain bike, cigarettes and bottles of alcohol. 

'Wearing a face covering does not mean we can't identify offenders and get them sent to jail.

'They targeted amenities in their own neighbourhood and their actions left local people shocked and disgusted.

'Communities should not have to tolerate this sort of crime; anyone with information about people committing this sort of offence, or who is dealing in stolen goods, should tell us so we can take action.'
