A construction worker managed to crawl to safety after the digger he was driving tumbled 20ft over a sea wall and landed on top of him.

The man, 42, was operating a digger on the harbour wall in Portland, Dorset, when it suddenly tipped over the edge.

He was thrown out of the driver's compartment as the excavator came crashing down on top of him.

A man operating a digger had to be rescued by emergency services and reportedly suffered 'significant injuries'

The man suffered a broken leg and collar bone and is thought to have crawled to a nearby bank where he could be rescued.

He was put onto a stretcher and was winched to safety by a helicopter that took him to Southampton General Hospital in Hampshire.

Peter Aitken, 56, a facilities manager who was at the scene, said: 'I saw the helicopter take off and watched it start lowering near one of my friend's offices.

'I went there to have a look at what was happening and initially I thought it was a practice but then I saw the digger in the water.

'The man was already out by the time I arrived but I believe he crawled out from the digger himself before he was rescued.'

A paramedic at the scene said the man is not believed to have suffered life-threatening injuries but is thought to have a broken leg and collar bone.

The driver was taken to hospital by air ambulance after being rescued by coastguards, fire brigade and workmates

A spokesman for Dorset Fire and Rescue said: 'Portland, Weymouth and a technical rescue team from Poole went to the scene where a digger had fallen off a 20ft wall onto a casualty.

'The crews carried out casualty care and assisted the paramedics and the ambulance.

'The casualty was put on a stretcher and winched to safety by the coastguard helicopter. He was then transported to hospital.'

Other witnesses at the scene said it was â€˜very lucky' the man was not more seriously injured.

Paul Dawson, of nearby Castletown Stores, said: 'All I saw was this rush of emergency vehicles outside the store.

'We are dealing with a rising tide here and the man was incredibly lucky the coastguard helicopter got to the area as quickly as it did. I believe it was instrumental in his rescue.'
