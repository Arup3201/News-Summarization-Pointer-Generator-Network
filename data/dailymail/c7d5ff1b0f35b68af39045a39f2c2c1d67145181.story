'Repaid with betrayal': Sergeant Michael Anderson with his wife Jolene, who yesterday slammed the MoD for its 'devious' decision to axe him

A soldier will miss out on almost £175,000 after his job was axed by defence bosses just 72 hours before he qualified for a full service pension.

Sergeant Michael Anderson, 35, was within three days of claiming a lifetime pension deal worth £261,278 for 18 years’ service.

He will now have to wait until he is 60 before receiving a package worth less than £90,000.

The case has fuelled suspicions that 
the Army, which is shedding 20,000 personnel in a cost-cutting exercise,
 is targeting those within touching distance of generous lifetime 
payments.

Critics have accused the Government of breaking the Armed Forces Covenant, the nation’s duty of care to troops.

Sgt Anderson serves with the Royal 
Dragoon Guards and has completed tours of duty in Northern Ireland and 
Iraq. He now faces the prospect of losing his job, home and financial 
security.

His wife Jolene, 32, a mental health care manager, said her husband had been ‘repaid with betrayal’.

‘He is crushed,’ she said. ‘It is 
disgraceful that he has been discarded just three days short of 
qualifying for his immediate pension.

'My husband has been building a 
secure foundation for a future for our family and now we are going to be
 potentially homeless.

‘He has been expected to live by and uphold the Army’s values of respect, integrity, loyalty and commitment.

‘Yet what respect, integrity and loyalty has he been shown by the MoD? Absolutely none.

‘We fully understand that cuts in 
personnel have to be made throughout the Armed Forces and across the 
public sector. But to wrench his pension away from him so close to 
qualifying is devious and completely undermines the values on which the 
Army is supposed to pride itself.’

Sgt Anderson, a father of two, lives in service housing in Catterick, North Yorkshire. The non-commissioned officer has also served as a casualty visitor, providing support for the families of killed or injured troops.

He was told last month he had been selected for compulsory redundancy from his job as a welfare officer with a 12-month notice period. 

Soldiers must serve 18 years to earn 
an immediate pension and tax-free lump sum when they leave the Army. Sgt
 Anderson was stunned to find out his redundancy starts on June 18 next 
year – after 17 years and 362 days.

The axe also fell just two weeks before he was presented with a medal for long service and good conduct. He now receives a redundancy payout of £87,417, with a £4,374-a-year pension once he reaches 60.

Had he reached 18 years he would have been given £261,278 – a £51,926 lump sum plus £8,723 a year until the age of 60.

The difference between the two deals is £173,861. 

Kevan Jones, a shadow defence minister, said the Government had left soldiers on the ‘financial scrapheap’.

‘This is no way to treat someone who has given their life to the defence of their country,’ he said.

Jayne Bullock, of campaign group Pensions Justice For Troops, said the MoD was saving £40million by axing about 100 servicemen with less than a year to go before reaching their full pension payouts.

‘It is an absolutely appalling way to treat soldiers who have seen more active service than any group since World War Two,’ she said.

‘The Government is treating them as economic collateral damage. It is morally wrong and it stinks.’

The MoD said it had to ‘draw the line somewhere’ and claimed the 1.2 per cent of personnel close to their immediate pension point will get a larger tax-free lump sum.

‘This is in addition to their resettlement grant and in some cases could total over £100,000,’ said a spokesman.
