A mother who took ‘confronting’ naked images of her young daughters was trying to further their dancing careers because she was obsessed with fame, a court has heard.

The woman, who cannot be named, was charged with producing and disseminating child abuse material following an investigation into alleged sexual and indecent assaults on dance school students by their teacher Grant Davies.

Davies ran a studio in Sydney's inner west and trained performers for hit productions, including Billy Elliot.

Grant Davies was arrested in May last year and charged with more than 60 child abuse offences

Grant Davies was a co-director of a now defunct dance school based in Sydney's inner west

'I was so caught up in this world,' the tearful mother told Sydney's Downing Centre District Court on Monday.

'I'm ashamed. I'm embarrassed. I regret the pain I have caused my family.'

From the moment her two daughters started dancing at Davies' studio, the mother said they were constantly photographed and filmed performing.

'Then he (Davies) started saying, "I don't want them to be concerned about their bodies"," the mother told her sentence hearing.

Although she knew it was wrong, the mother said she became 'obsessed and focused totally on the girls' and Davies' dance studio.

Over the course of almost three years the mother admitted to taking numerous photos of her daughters, some of which depicted them naked and performing lewd acts.

She would dress the girls up in specific costumes and then direct them to pose in particular ways.

In one of a series of text message exchanges read out to the court, Davies is alleged to have asked the mother on November 8, 2011 'are the girls naked', to which she responded 'how about on the weekend they do you some more special G-shots?'

When he replied 'why wait?', the mother sent sexually explicit photos half an hour later of her daughter.

'Now that has made me excited. I'm so lucky,' Davies allegedly wrote.

The offences where allegedly committed against 10 of his dance students

Psychiatrist Dr Antony Milch said the mother had taken the images believing it would be 'the factor' that would promote her daughters' dance careers at the dance studio.

She also exploited them in order to satisfy her own obsession with dancing and fame, he said.

The court heard the 42-year-old's own dance dreams had faltered after she battled with anorexia.

She then worked as a topless dancer in a strip club where it is alleged she was sexually assaulted.

Judge Peter Zahra asked Dr Milch to view the images the mother took of her two daughters.

'I hadn't seen the images before,' Dr Milch said, adding 'they are extremely confronting and distressing'.

'I think it is difficult to understand how any mother could take such images and provide them to other parties to disseminate the material.'

Dr Milch said he didn't believe the woman had an understanding of what she had done, nor has she expressed any guilt.

Nevertheless, he said she should be reunited with her two daughters.

The mother has pleaded guilty to two counts of using a child under the age of 14 for the production of child abuse material and two counts of disseminating child abuse material.

Her hearing continues.

Davies is facing more than 60 charges, including child sex and child pornography offences.
