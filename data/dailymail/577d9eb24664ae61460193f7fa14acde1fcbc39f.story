Almost 300 people were arrested in Paris as thousands protested against gay marriage, just days ahead of France’s first gay wedding.

The arrests followed a city centre rally involving 150,000 on Sunday night. Protesters threw rocks and smoke bombs while police responded with tear gas and baton charges. Journalists were also attacked, with at least two seriously injured.

The worst clashes involved CRS riot police and hooded right-wing ‘ultras’ around some of Paris’s most famous  landmarks, including Les Invalides.

France’s gay marriage law, making it the 14th country to allow same sex unions, was passed in the French parliament on May 18.

‘Traditional France has been 
threatened by these new measures and that’s why we have taken to the 
streets,’ said Jerome Martin, a 23-year-old protester.

‘The violence highlights the frustration we feel at having been betrayed by liberal politicians.’

Mr Martin spoke as hundreds threw rocks and smoke bombs at the police, who responded with tear gas and baton charges.

There were numerous injuries on both 
sides, with the worst fights breaking out on the grass esplanade 
opposite Les Invalides, and in surrounding streets.

Journalists were also attacked, with at least two seriously injured.

The area is next door to the French 
parliament, where President Francois Hollande’s Socialist government 
introduced and then passed the gay marriage bill.

It meant that France became the 14th country in the world to allow same sex unions.

The protests, which are strongly 
backed by the Roman Catholic Church, have become a chance for the French
 right to rally against the left.

Interior Minister Manuel Valls said some 100 known far-right protesters were among those arrested in the early hours of Monday.

Some 4,500 police officers were on duty in Paris on Sunday to deal with the huge crowds.

France’s first gay wedding is due to take place on Wednesday in Montpellier, in the south of the country.

Despite the violent rally, a survey published on Sunday showed 53 per cent of French people support gay marriage and adoption.

But the mass rallies have contributed to President Hollande’s low popularity ratings.

His administration has been plagued 
by economic recession and unemployment has now hit more than 10 per 
cent, but Hollande got some welcome news on Sunday, after his popularity
 inched up four points to 29 per cent this month.

Although
 it failed to block gay marriage, the protest movement hopes its show of
 force will delay or stop further laws allowing assisted procreation and
 surrogate motherhood for gay couples.

The situation began to escalate on Tuesday when writer Dominique Venner, who is linked to a far-right French nationalist party, shot and killed himself inside Paris’ Notre Dame Cathedral.

The protest was called 'La Manif pour Tous' (Demonstration for All)

He had called for 'spectacular' action to protect France’s identity, and was denouncing same-sex marriage law.

Hollande’s Socialist Party denounced 
the protest, highlighting the fact that the law has already passed in 
parliament and was validated by the Constitutional Council.

The conservative opposition UMP party was split over whether to continue the rallies.

UMP President Jean-Francois Cope and several other party leaders joined the march and urged young protesters to join his party as a 'new UMP generation' and campaign against the left-wing government.

But several other UMP leaders, including former conservative prime ministers Francois Fillon and Alain Juppe, kept their distance, saying lawmakers should exercise their influence in parliament rather than march in street protests.

The protests have grown into a wider opposition movement against the unpopular President Hollande
