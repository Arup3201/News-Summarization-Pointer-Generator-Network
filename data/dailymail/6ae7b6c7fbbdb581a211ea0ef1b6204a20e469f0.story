Retail manager Boualem Guerbi is being sued, along with Barker shoes', by two saleswomen

The 'sex-obsessed' boss at one of Britain's most exclusive shoemakers hired only 'beautiful girls with nice bodies' – and then molested them, a tribunal heard yesterday.

Boualem Guerbi, 60, allegedly forced saleswomen to sit on his lap, tried to hug and kiss them, told them about visiting a nudist beach and bragged about receiving sexual offers from strangers.

The married father-of-two made advances to a string of attractive recruits at Barker Shoes, which has made luxury footwear since 1880, and froze out those who dared to spurn him, the tribunal heard.

Mr Guerbi even stripped to the waist in front of staff at the brand's flagship store in Regent Street, London, it is alleged.

Mehrnoosh Bolhasani, 46, and Agnese Avota, 29, claim they were among his victims. 

Miss Bolhasani wept as she told the tribunal that he sexually assaulted her in his office and forced a female colleague to sit on his lap.

Miss Bolhasani, manager of the Regent Street store, said Mr Guerbi had favourites among the 'eye candy' he hired but that his 'rampant sexual attentions' towards female staff were ignored by Barker, which sells leather shoes for as much as £470.

She claimed she was 'subjected to repeated acts of sexual touching and harassment by Mr Guerbi' after joining Barker in 2010, beginning with him trying to hug her in the shop's kitchen while he was topless.

She said: 'Subsequently, he often told me about his body, how good he looked and how fit he was for his age. He often told me stories about how girls approached him to talk to him and make him sexual offers. I found his conversation disturbing.'

Miss Bolhasani said he also told her about a nudist beach he had discovered, adding: 'He insisted on telling me in detail about the naked people he saw there, and how they looked while they played ball.

'I had thought he was a family man and had respected him. Now I realised he was obsessed with sex.'

Miss Bolhasani claimed that in May 2012, retail manager Mr Guerbi assaulted her after telling her the rest of the staff hated her.

She broke down in tears as she described the alleged incident to the Central London Employment Tribunal yesterday and could not go on. But in a witness statement, she said: 'He pulled me to him forcibly and put my legs between his.

'He pulled my face towards him and tried to kiss me. I just managed to get out. I felt traumatised.' 

She claimed Mr Guerbi again tried to hug her in a staff room in June 2013. She said: 'I pushed him back. I was now really scared.'

She claimed she complained to her bosses that Mr Guerbi just employs 'beautiful girls with nice bodies' and said she was told that was why she had been hired. Miss Bolhasani also told how Miss Avota broke down in tears at work over Mr Guerbi's behaviour.

She said: 'One day he held her face in his hands and tried to kiss her. She was shocked and tried to free herself … From that point I understood his attitude to her changed and he treated her unfairly.

'I know he approached other girls and those who refused his sexual approaches fared badly.'

Guerbi, who hid his face as he left the tribunal, denies the pairs 'hurtful' allegations

The two women are each suing Barker and Mr Guerbi for sexual harassment, sex discrimination and victimisation. 

Iranian Miss Bolhasani is claiming race discrimination after Mr Guerbi allegedly ranted that 'bloody Iranians are all aggressive'. 

Latvian Miss Avota is also claiming sexual orientation discrimination after Mr Guerbi allegedly told colleagues he thought she was a lesbian when she cut her hair.

Miss Bolhasani, of East Dulwich, south-east London, still works for the firm but is off with stress, while Miss Avota, of Hampstead, north-west London, resigned in July 2013.

Algeria-born Mr Guerbi, who is a British national, strongly denies the 'hurtful' allegations. 

Barker is also vigorously denying the claims.

Mr Guerbi admits hugging Miss Bolhasani but says that in his culture hugs and kisses on the cheek are a 'common courtesy'. 

He denies ever embracing Miss Avota, saying she was an 'introvert' who would not have liked it. 

He also insists he never accused her of being a lesbian.

Company chiefs interviewed both women over their complaints but did not uphold their grievances.

The tribunal continues.
