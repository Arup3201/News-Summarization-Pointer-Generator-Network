Gareth Bale was berated as he left the Santiago Bernabeu after Real Madrid's 4-3 defeat by Schalke  on Tuesday night, with fans caling him an 'a******e' and a 'prostitute' among other names.

The Champions League holders made it through to the quarter-finals despite losing the seven-goal thriller, taking the last-16 tie 5-4 on aggregate.

But Bale was the subject of boos again with the home faithful seemingly losing patience with the former Tottenham star, and, along with some of his Real team-mates, was met with a wall of noise as he left the parking garage in Madrid.

As he drove away, supporters appeared to abuse him, yelling: 'Son of b*****s! A******e! Gay!' before one said: 'Male prostitute Welshman.'

Bale became the most expensive footballer in the world upon signing for the Galacticos in an Â£86million deal and was impressive in his first season, netting crucial goals in Copa del Rey and Champions League final victories.

But as his second campaign has worn on, he has been labelled as a 'ball-hog' by sections of the Bernabeu crowd, with many voicing their anger when he doesn't pass to team-mate and Balon d'Or holder Cristiano Ronaldo.

After the shock defeat on Tuesday night some supporters were waving white handkerchiefs in a form of protest, while Bale was criticsed after dragging a shot wide when in a good position in front of goal.

Manchester United have been linked with a mega-swoop for the 25-year-old, though the Welshman insists he loves life in Madrid and will do anything to accomplish his dream.

Iker Casillas and Sami Khedira were also met with insults from the supporters. Khedira, who is out of contract in the summer, was told by one fan to 'die' before being told to 'go to Schalke, dog.'

Cristiano Ronaldo scored two goals for Madrid and was Carlo Ancelotti's star performer against the Bundesliga side, but even he told reporters he won't be speaking to the media until the end of the season as his side's struggles continue.

Television cameras captured a grim-looking Ronaldo shaking his head and apparently mouthing 'disgrace' to Karim Benzema shortly before the end of the game.
