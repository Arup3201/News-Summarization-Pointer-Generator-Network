Like many real ales, its quirky name helps it to stand out from the crowd.

Unfortunately for a brew branded 'Top Totty', it stood out a little too much for one female Labour MP who has managed to have it banned from a House of Commons bar.

Kate Green, the party's equalities spokesman, said she found the beer – which has a pump plate with a cartoon picture of a bikini-clad bunny girl – offensive, adding later that it 'demeans women'.

'Demeaning to women': Kate Green, Labour's equalities spokesman, said she found the beer offensive

Despite never having even seen the 
pump in question – and the bar not receiving a single complaint – Miss 
Green yesterday stood up in the Commons chamber to demand it be removed 
from sale.

Last night, however, her stance 
provoked a backlash from men and women alike who branded her 
'humourless' and criticised her 'knee-jerk puritanism'. Slater's Ales, 
meanwhile, the ale's family-run Staffordshire brewery, said the outcry 
had seen its orders double.

The £2.70-a-pint beer was banned from 
the Strangers' Bar, where MPs can take guests, within an hour of Miss 
Green's complaint. Leader of the House Sir George Young intervened to 
rid Parliament of what he called 'offensive pictures'.

Miss Green, MP for Stretford and 
Urmston in Greater Manchester, brought up the issue at business 
questions in the Commons, where she called for a debate in the House on 
'dignity at work in Parliament'.

She took up parliamentary time to say:
 'I was disturbed last night to learn that the guest beer in the 
Strangers' Bar is called Top Totty, and that there is a picture of a 
nearly naked woman on the tap.' She said later on Twitter that it 
'demeans women'.

But many MPs did not share her 
outrage. Tory Tracey Crouch asked on Twitter: 'Why is a beer called Top 
Totty offensive & now banned from Commons?'

Furore: Ms Green called for a debate on 'dignity at work in Parliament' and asked Sir George Young to back her demands for Top Totty to be withdrawn

Sally Bercow, Commons Speaker John Bercow's wife, wrote on Twitter: 'Cannot *believe* that there's a beer called Top Totty on sale in the Commons! Outrageous - does Mr B know?'

Fellow Conservative MP Nadine Dorries 
tweeted: 'Westminster = sense of humour-free zone. Banning of the Top 
Totty beer was weak PC decision and gives sensible pro-women advocates a
 bad name.'

The ale – described as 'blonde, full 
bodied with a voluptuous hop aroma' – had been introduced as a guest ale
 by Tory Jeremy Lefroy, MP for Stafford, where it is brewed.

Mr Lefroy said: 'These guest ale slots
 offer a very welcome opportunity for small independent breweries like 
Slater's to reach a wider audience with their products, some of which 
have cheeky names.'

The ban was also denounced by Mike Nattrass, Stafford's UKIP MEP, and Claire Fox, director of think-tank the Institute of Ideas.

Mr Nattrass said: 'Miss Green really 
is a humourless sort. This sort of knee-jerk puritanism does more to 
damage the cause of equality than a thousand beer labels.'

And Miss Fox said: 'What really 
demeans women is the idea that we've no sense of humour – and MPs acting
 as sanctimonious killjoys in our name.'

Last night Vicki Slater, of Slater's 
Ales, said: 'At first I just couldn't believe it that in this economic 
climate a Labour MP would get exercised about the name of a beer.

'But all this publicity has been a 
blessing. After the fuss, it sold out immediately. People have been 
phoning from all over Britain asking us to supply their pubs. We're 
delivering twice as much Top Totty tomorrow as we ever have before.'
