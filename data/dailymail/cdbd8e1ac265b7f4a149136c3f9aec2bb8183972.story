Glamour model Julia Martinez fraudulently claimed more than £44,000 in benefits over a three year period

A glamour model who starred in a Playboy DVD has walked free from court after fraudulently claiming more than £44,000 in benefits. 

Julia Martinez, 43,  received £27,908.67 in income support, a further £14,112 in disability payments and council tax relief of £2,178.63.

Ms Martinez, from Cheltenham, pleaded guilty to five charges for falsely claiming benefits over a three year period. A further two charges remain no file. 

Appearing at Bristol Crown Court, Ms Martinez received a nine-month jail sentence which was suspended for a year. 

However, she will have to reappear on June 26 where she will hear how much money she has to repay the state under the terms of the Proceeds of Crime Act.

Ms Martinez submitted the benefits claim after she told officials that she was unable to work. She appeared at an earlier court hearing in a wheelchair while using a neck brace.  

The court heard that Ms Martinez has a successful acting, modelling and photographic career and used an alias to send money to Spain in a bid to avoid detection. 

In total, Ms Martinez received £44,199.30 in fraudulent payments.  

George Threlfall, prosecuting, said Martinez 'loved money, whether earned or received through benefits.'

He told the court: 'Her diary is a fascinating insight into someone who was clearly obsessed by money, making it both honestly and dishonestly.

'She said the benefit system was 'fair game.' Miss Martinez has done her best to cover her tracks, by using aliases and transferring money from the UK to Spain.

'She works as a model or as a photographer. She had her own businesses, one of which was called Shoot the Bride.

'There was a sister company called Shoot the Moon.

'We also seized a DVD. It was clear she had acted in a Playboy DVD.'

He said she wrote that she was very lucky, owned her own house, was slim and attractive, had a lovely dog and 'a benefit system that allows me to live comfortably'.

Rob Lancaster, defending, said Martinez had a history of mental health problems and was trying to get away from an abusive and horrid past.

'Miss Martinez has suffered serious depression since her 20s, long before she made her first claim,' be said.

'She was trying to take steps to move forward with her life. These steps should have been disclosed.

'The fact is that she was someone trying to get away from benefits, not live a life on them.'

Mr Lancaster told the court that when she was told she couldn't have children in 2005, it hit her hard, with Martinez reaching her lowest point in 2008.

'She suffered abuse as a child - both physically and mentally. She is a lady who has always sought the help of others to improve herself.

'Her life goal was to have children. '

Martinez admitted one count of making false representations when claiming income support and one count of failing to update the DWP on her change of situation.

She also pleaded guilty to one count of falsely claiming disability allowance and two counts of claiming she was entitled to council tax relief.

Judge William Hart sentenced her to a nine-month prison sentence, suspended for 12 months. Martinez may have to pay a fine, but that will be dealt with at a confiscation hearing in June.

Judge Hart said: 'The view the Crown takes of you and the view your friends, family and defence also have, is like two different people being spoken of.

'That often happens in a fraud case - the Crown sees someone who has cheated the system. The defence see the reason someone finds themselves in that position.

'It often lies somewhere between those extremes.'

The court heard that Ms Martinez, right, claimed benefits after telling officials that she was too ill to work
