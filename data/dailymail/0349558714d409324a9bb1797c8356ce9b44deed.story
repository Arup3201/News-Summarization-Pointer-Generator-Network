After-effects: Jay Francis shows off his face after he was stung nearly 400 times by an angry swarm on Friday while watching a baseball game with his family

An 89-year-old Utah grandfather who survived being stung by nearly 400 bees while he watched a baseball game with his family on Friday has described the terrifying attack.

'First it was one, then two, then three. Then they were everywhere,' said Jay Francis of the attack. 'It was just horrible. My head started aching. I can't believe how sensitive it was.'

'My whole head was just swollen. I felt like I was a lucky man after hearing the statements the doctors had to make,' he said.

The swarm of nearly 1,000 angry bees descended on the baseball game at Elks Field, sending players running and Francis and his family trying to duck for cover.

Francis' son, Kevin told KSL he was shocked to turn and see his father enveloped by the bees which had been disturbed from their underground hive.

'His face was just covered in bees. You saw his eyes and his mouth,' Kevin Francis said.

The Francis family tried to get the bees off of Jay for 15 minutes before the St. George Fire Department arrived to help.

'Since they were being so aggressive, we used water and foam to destroy those aggressive bees,' said Robert Hooper an official with the St. George Fire Department. 'There were people running everywhere, swatting at bees. It was very chaotic.'

Once the swarm was fought off, Francis was rushed to hospital where he was treated for nearly 400 hundred bee stings.

His wife was treated for almost a dozen stings herself and his son was hit with 50 stings.

The bee attack during the baseball game began when a beehive near a telephone pole at the baseball field was disturbed just after 11 a.m.

Lone Peak High School baseball coach Matt Bezzant told The Spectrum newspaper of St. George that the bees came from a dugout and players were chased by as many as 70 bees at one point.

Fire crews doused the dugout area with a chemical foam to combat the bees.

Attack: One man was seriously injured and several other people received minor injuries when over 1,000 bees swarmed Elks Field in St. George, Utah, about 11am Friday after their underground hive was disturbed

Casey Lofthouse, a local beekeeper and a member of the Washington County Search and Rescue team, told the St. George News that 'bees will protect their home'.

'Both Africanized or European honeybees will protect their hives. The main difference is that the Africanized bees are more aggressive,' he added.

Lofthouse said in the event of a swarm of bees, cover your head and neck as best as possible and vacate the area, preferably going indoors.
