New Tory enforcer Andrew Mitchell has leapt to the defence of health minister Anna Soubry after backbenchers warned she was a 'train wreck waiting to happen'.

Ms Soubry, promoted into government by David Cameron last week after less than two and half years as an MP, sparked a storm after branding the law on assisted suicide 'ridiculous'.

She demanded greater 'honesty' about whether or not prosecutions would be brought against people who help relatives to die.

Anna Soubry was appointed health minister in David Cameron's reshuffle but angered Tory MPs with remarks on assisted suicide

Her comments were publicly criticised by a number of Tory MPs.

Nadine Dorries said Ms Soubry 'displayed a profound ignorance of the vulnerable position many of the disabled, elderly and chronically sick would find themselves in should she get her way'.

Mark Pritchard warned of ‘an almighty parliamentary row’ if attempts were made to change the law.

Now furious backbenchers have demanded Mr Mitchell, the new chief whip, rein Ms Soubry in. One Tory MP told him: ‘She is a train wreck waiting to happen.'

The MP added later: 'Just a nightmare. I don’t know what the PM was thinking.’

A second MP said: ‘We have been told to bite our tongues but she is making the government look ridiculous.'

However it is understood Mr Mitchell has rebuffed the rebels, telling them to give Ms Soubry 'a break and time to find her feet'.

Mr Mitchell - nicknamed 'Thrasher' - was promoted from International Development Secretary to take charge of the Whips' Office, at a time when Tory backbenchers are increasingly willing to rebel.

The row illustrates the major headache caused by Mr Cameron’s first unforced reshuffle since becoming Prime Minister in 2010.

Tory MPs elected in 2005 are furious at being overlooked for promotion, while Ms Soubry was among several who entered the Commons in 2010 to join ministerial ranks.

The former barrister was one of six Tory women to join the government in response to complaints that Mr Cameron is failing to connect with female voters.

Downing Street hope her no-nonsense style, honed as a presenter on ITV's This Morning in the 1980s, will resonate with the electorate.

But the furore triggered by her remarks on assisted suicide over-shadowed ministers today unveiling a new £1.5m suicide prevention strategy.

Ms Soubry said in an interview at the weekend: 'I think it’s ridiculous and 
appalling that people have to go abroad to end their life instead of 
being able to end their life at home.

'The
rules that we have about who we don’t prosecute allow things to happen 
but there’s a good argument that we should be a bit more honest about 
it.'

Asked about Ms Soubry’s comments, Downing Street today hinted that Parliament could look again at the issue.

The Prime Minister’s official spokesman said: ‘There has obviously been some debate over the last week and the Nicholson family case has raised some very profound moral and ethical issues.

‘I think there are very strong arguments on both sides of the debate and it’s an issue that no doubt will be debated further. It’s an issue for Parliament to decide, it’s an issue of conscience too.

'This is one of those issues which is likely to be subject to further debate in the coming weeks and months.'

It comes after locked-in syndrome 
sufferer Tony Nicklinson died a week after he lost his legal bid to end 
his life with a doctor’s help.

His widow, Jane, has said she would continue his fight to win a landmark ruling for the legal right to die.

Mrs Nicklinson, whose lawyers say she has a 'compelling' case to be allowed to continue her husband's legal fight, welcomed Ms Soubry's willingness to 'stick her neck out' but said rights should not be restricted to the dying.

Since new guidelines for prosecutors in assisted suicide cases were brought in in February 2010, anyone acting with compassion to help end the life of someone who has decided they cannot go on is unlikely to face criminal charges.

Norman Lamb, the Liberal Democrat minister at the Department of Health, today backed reform of the law on assisted dying, while stressing that it is not something the government has policy on.

He told BBC Radio 4's Today programme: 'I think there is a case for a debate.

'That's my personal view, it's nothing to do with my position as a minister in the Department of Health.'
