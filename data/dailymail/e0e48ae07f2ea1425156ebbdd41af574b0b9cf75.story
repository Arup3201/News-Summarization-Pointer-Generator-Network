Barcelona midfielder Xavi admits his playing days are over and says he would relish the chance to follow the example of Pep Guardiola by one day coaching the Catalan giants.

Xavi replaced Guardiola on the pitch as Barca's midfield playmaker having been promoted to the first team by then coach Louis van Gaal and now he has admitted he would jump at the opportunity to coach at the Nou Camp.

'Hopefully I can (follow Guardiola) and even more so in my home here,' the 34-year-old told El Pais.

Barcelona ace Xavi has revealed he has aspirations to follow former boss Pep Guardiola into coaching 

The 34-year-old is starting to plan for life after football and has admitted his 'playing days are numbered'

Bayern Munich coach Guardiola took over the reins at Barcelona in 2008 and won three La Liga titles and two Champions Leagues in four years while making tiki-taka famous.

'My playing days are numbered, that is clear. I can feel it in my body as it is difficult for me to recover and I need to measure how much effort I am putting in,' said Xavi.

'I don't have the same sharpness to play every three days any more.'

Xavi has been a key player in a golden generation for Barcelona and Spain but he says it was not easy at the start being compared to Guardiola.

'Everyone was saying I was going to be the new hero and it was tough. This made a difference to me as it meant I went out trying to be my own person while everyone else said I was the new Guardiola,' he said.

'You grow up quickly as footballers as you are being judged all the time. It is life, and it is the case from when you are young.'

Xavi retired from international football after Spain's disappointing group stage exit at this year's World Cup and says he had planned to go after La Roja won back-to-back European titles in 2012 until coach Vicente del Bosque changed his mind.

'I told him, "I am not enjoying it as much now, it is time for someone else," but he said, "Come on are you depressed?'' explained Xavi.

'I told him I had thought about it a lot but he said I was very important. After what happened in Brazil though, if I had known, I would have retired then. It is still true that I have enjoyed the last two years a lot though.'
