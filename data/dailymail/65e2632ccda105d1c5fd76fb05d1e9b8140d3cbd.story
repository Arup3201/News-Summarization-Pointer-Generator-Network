Alessandro Miccoli had surgery after discovering he had a potentially fatal heart condition

Standing
 on stage, ready to begin his next number, rock musician Alessandro 
Miccoli, 28, felt his heart pounding.

'Within seconds my chest had 
tightened up - I could hardly breathe and the arteries on either side of
 my neck were sticking out as thick as pencils,' he says.

'I could 
see my clothes moving with the power of my heartbeat. The pain was 
agonising, and I was terrified I was about to have a heart attack.'

Somehow,
 he got through the song, then crawled backstage, where an ambulance was
 called. 'It took half an hour because when the control centre heard my 
age, they downgraded it from an emergency,' he says. However, a monitor 
revealed his heart rate was 250 beats per minute. A normal rate for a 
healthy young man is 65-80.

'I'd been suffering from minor episodes 
of heart pounding from my earlier 20s, and I'd seen my GP several times 
who told me not to worry about it,' says Alessandro. 'Previously my 
heart rate always returned to normal after a couple of hours, and I was 
sure it would this time. Luckily, the paramedics didn't listen to me.'

In
 hospital, doctors administered morphine for the vice-like chest pain, 
while trying unsuccessfully to bring down Alessandro's heart rate with 
drugs.

After 45 minutes, he was still struggling for breath, and doctors feared he was about to have a potentially fatal heart attack.

They
 told him he needed emergency treatment under general anaesthetic - 
electric shocks would be used to stop then start his heart again, in the
 hope this would 'reset' it. 'I knew from their faces that they might 
not be able to start my heart again,' recalls Alessandro.

The 
procedure worked, and the next morning he was told he was suffering from
 Wolff-Parkinson-White Syndrome, which affects the electrical circuitry 
controlling heartbeats.

Alessandro, from Birmingham, had been born 
with extra electrical pathways in the heart.

Occasionally, electrical 
signals travelled down them, causing his heart to contract much faster.

Every
 year, 600 young people die from conditions affecting the heart's 
electrical activity. It's not known how many people are living with 
these problems, as most, like Alessandro, are only diagnosed when they 
become life-threatening.

His symptoms got suddenly worse after he'd 
been performing in LA with his twin brother Adriano and their sister 
Francesca,  26, as the rock band Miccoli.

Late nights and partying 
could have triggered his collapse, as people with extra, or distorted, 
electrical pathways are sensitive to the stimulation of adrenaline, 
explains Sanjay Sharma, professor of inherited cardiac disease and 
sports cardiology at St George's NHS Trust, London.

'If their 
lifestyle includes a lot of alcohol, caffeine, lengthy exertion or lack 
of sleep, it can increase their adrenaline levels and that can 
exacerbate the symptoms of their condition, in extreme cases to a fatal 
level.'

Problems with the heart's electrical circuits are also thought to have a genetic link.

Alessandro's
 father has had atrial fibrillation, a faulty heart rhythm, for most of 
his life, while his grandfather died of a heart attack at 73.

After 
Alessandro was rushed to hospital in Britain in June 2009, his brother 
was found to be suffering from a very mild form of tachycardia - rapid 
heartbeat - which didn't need treatment; his sister has not been 
affected.

Alessandro was put on flecainide acetate, a drug to control
 his heart rate, but suffered bad side-effects. His cardiologist then 
suggested cardiac ablation, where the extra electrical circuitry is 
burnt away, stopping the faulty messages being sent.

This treatment 
is safe and has an extremely high success rate of up to 95   per cent, 
says Professor Sharma. But Alessandro was  unlucky. He had the operation
 in early 2010 but two months later was rushed to hospital with a heart 
rate of 250. Doctors had to use electric shocks again  to 'reset' it.A
 second ablation was out of the question, as patients have to wait at 
least three months between them to allow for healing and gauge exactly 
how successful the first has been.

So Alessandro was sent home and 
told to rest. 'Miccoli was on the verge of breaking into the big time, 
and I was being told to take it easy,' he says. 'I also felt bad for my 
siblings. To  contain our frustration, we decided to help raise 
awareness of heart conditions.

Once a week, the family went into shopping centres to play free gigs, hand out leaflets, raise money and talk to people.

'I
 told them I hadn't pushed my GP for a referral to a cardiologist 
because I thought a heart condition was something that happened to old 
men,' says Alessandro. 'But up to eight young people a week die from 
conditions such as mine.'

The campaign had a dramatic result. 'A 
woman told us her five-year-old boy had described a "noisy helicopter in
 his chest". I told her to take him to his GP and insist on a referral.

'We later heard he'd been diagnosed with tachycardia. He has now been successfully treated.'

In
 December 2010, Alessandro had a second ablation. It didn't work, and he
 also developed atrial fibrillation, which affects electrical activity 
in a different part of the heart. In other words, he had two electrical 
disorders.

He was put on beta-blockers until he could have a third 
operation, which cured the atrial fibrillation but not the 
Wolff-Parkinson's-White.

Finally, in December 2011, a fourth 
operation destroyed the remaining rogue electrical pathways. 'I'm still 
checked regularly, but don't have to take medication,' says Alessandro. 
'We're back gigging and in talks with a major record company.'

Last 
year, the band released an album called Arrhythmia - the medical term 
for a faulty heartbeat. 'We want to  continue raising awareness of the 
condition that nearly killed me,' says Alessandro.
