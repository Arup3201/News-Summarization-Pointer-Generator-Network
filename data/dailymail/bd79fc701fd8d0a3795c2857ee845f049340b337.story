Tasmanian mum Nicole Cowles is hopeful the rising groundswell of support for the legalisation of medicinal marijuana could stop her having to obtain illegally from interstate drug dealers to help the suffering of her daughter Alice Agnew, who is just eight.‘I’m seeing Alice for who she really is – I only saw glimpses of her before,’ Ms Cowles said about the improvement of her daughter since she started taking the liquid form of cannabis four times a day in February to help control her seizures.The family is one of 200 across the country who are forced to import the cannabis from a supplier in Kempsey in NSW which is free of charge but the waiting list is sitting at 1,500 with people desperate to get their hands on the drug to relieve chronic pain and aid with seizures.

This week, governments in NSW, Queensland and Tasmania, where Alice lives, all signalled they would support law reform which would allow chronically-ill patients to take cannabis to relieve their suffering.

Clinical trials of medicinal cannabis could happen in NSW, but Premier Mike Baird is waiting on details about regulation and supply before making any commitments.

Under a private member's bill to be introduced next month by Nationals MP Kevin Anderson, terminally-ill people and their carers will be legally able to carry up to 15 grams of cannabis.

Mr Baird indicated his support after meeting Daniel Haslam, a 24-year-old who in 2010 was told he would only live for a few more months.

When asked if he would support a clinical trial, as proposed by the Australian Medical Association, Mr Baird said 'it may well be something we have to do'.

I'm open to that,' he told ABC Radio on Thursday.

After rejecting a medicinal cannabis trial earlier this month, the Tasmanian government has announced it would be prepared to support the findings of an Upper House inquiry into medicinal cannabis.

The renewed push to relax the laws comes as a new poll reveals two thirds of Australian’s support the use of cannabis for medicinal purposes.

It’s unlikely there will be any change to the legislation in Victoria with the State government and the opposition admitting they have no immediate plans to legalise the drug

Earlier this month, pregnant mother of one Cassie Batten was questioned by Victorian police over the use of cannabis oil to treat her epileptic three year old son.

Ms Cowles said the government getting on board with running trials would help save her daughter's life who doesn't get seizures now unless she is unwell.

She said the regulation of medicinal cannabis would prevent families being left with no choice but to access the drug - which has the THC removed that gives the high - illegally.

‘There is such a demand that families will end up going out and getting it anyway they can – even from a drug dealer down the road,’ she said. 'There has been an obvious significant improvement in Alice both physically and mentally - she's interacting so much more.'

When Alice was taken off the medication for a few weeks in April, she ended up in hospital after having the worst seizures she had endured for quite some time, her mother said.

Ms Cowles receives the medicinal marijuana at no charge from Tony Bower who is facing court next week after almost 70 plants confiscated from his property in Kempsey in NSW about four months ago.

Mr Bower has been charged for breaching his good behaviour bond after he was first charged three years ago for cultivating the marijuana. He could now be facing up to two years in court.

‘If I go to jail – parents are going to watch their children die - I don’t have an option,’ he said speaking of the horrendous side affects children can suffer from anti-convulsion medication including loss of taste and smell and even blindness.

Mr Bower said he has about 200 people who he sends the cannabis to with at least 130 of them being children - but his waiting list is as long as 1,500.

‘I mainly only take children now - the quicker you get to them and stop the seizures - they don’t get the brain damage,’ he said. ‘People don’t realise the drugs they put them on straight away have massive side effects – kids can be blind within a couple of days.’
