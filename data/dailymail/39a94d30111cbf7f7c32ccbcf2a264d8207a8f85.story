A review into social media and its role in children's suicides 'glorifies and normalises suicidal behaviours' a recent study has shown.

The Commission for Children and Young People in Queensland, concerned at   suicide rates amongst Australian youngsters, released some of the 140 submissions they have made on Sunday night, exploring the way social media plays a part.

One child a week commits suicide, with another 50-60 admitted to hospital for self-harming - and boys are twice as likely to end their own lives than girls, writes The Australian.

More and more Australian youngsters are exposed to suicide via the internet and socia media, sparking some copycat cases says a new submission by the Commission for Children and Young People in Queensland

The submission report, spear-headed by Megan Mitchell, the National Children's Commissioner says that several have killed themselves after looking up instructions on the internet. 

But even more worrying, some of the 140 submissions that were released on Sunday show that youngsters can be drawn into the social leverage and immortalisation it gives them.

There is proof that one teenager chose to end her life after seeing the outpouring of grief another youngster had received online after killing herself, with one user's condolence message attracting 190 likes.

The submission says: 'It can be interpreted that there is clearly a social status in not only knowing a suicide occurred but even more so in contributing and participating in the shared grief. There is a social reward for this behaviour.'

Because the internet and SMS has replaced the traditional way in which children and teenagers communicate,  access to suicide is instantaneous and un-policed.

'The fear of missing out and the status of participation outweigh any negative stigma in being associated with a suicide death,' says the submission 

More than 2000 young people have signed up to websites set up in memory of recent youngsters who committed suicide in Queensland, even though the majority didn't even know the troubled teenagers.

That figure is five times the number of people who would usually be exposed to suicide in the community.

'The instant outpouring of grief and love means that 'young people are actively engaging in activities that expose them to youth suicide, such as seeking out suicide tribute pages online,' says the submission.

'The fear of missing out and the status of participation outweigh any negative stigma in being associated with a suicide death.' 

A quick Google search flags up pro-suicide websites and the report clearly states, 'There are pro-suicide forums with content that glorifies and normalises suicidal behaviours'.

'The fear of missing out and the status of participation outweigh any negative stigma in being associated with a suicide death,' says the submission

According to the Australian Institute of Health and Welfare there were 18,277 hospitalisations for young people intentional self-harming between the ages of 3 and 17 in 2007 and 2013.

And 333 youngsters between the ages of four and 17 died from their injuries which were cause by self-harming between 2007 - 2012.  

Alarmingly the report also found that of the 187 Queensland children and youngsters who have committed suicide, one third  knew someone who had done it before them.

The National Children's Commissioner is demanding the government to do more on a national level to raise awareness and train those who are in a position to spot the risks and warning signs before it's too late.

If you are suicidal, self-harming, depressed or need someone to talk to contact Beyond Blue or Kids Helpline or dial them on 1 800 55 1800.
