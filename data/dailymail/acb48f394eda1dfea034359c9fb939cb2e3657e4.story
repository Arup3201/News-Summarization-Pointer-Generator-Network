Terry Davenport, 63, had fit of road rage after allegedly seeing his 21-year-old lover with a younger man

A 63-year-old man from Luther, Michigan was arrested after he allegedly used his car to force another 31-year-old driver off the road and drag a woman down the street 'after seeing the woman with the younger man.'

Terry Davenport, 63 was arraigned on Tuesday April 8 on two counts of assault with a dangerous weapon, failure to stop after collision and reckless driving and driving with a suspended license.

The Cadillac Police Department say that Davenport became upset when he saw a 21-year-old woman with another man at her mother's house.

Davenport allegedly tried to physically remove a 31-year-old man from his ford explorer in which the 21-year-old was was in the passenger's seat.

The woman then allegedly got into 63-year-old Davenport's Oldsmobile Alero 'in order to calm him down.'

The 21-year-old's plan backfired and when she tried to escape the Alero, Davenport dragged her ' a short distance' with the moving vehicle.

M Live reports that the woman managed to escape and run back into the ford explorer but Davenport tailed the vehicle and repeatedly hit the car with his own car as the vehicles were speeding down the road.

The chase, which lasted for about 2 miles, stopped when the younger man went through a stop sign and rolled into a ditch.

The 31-year-old attempted to pull his car into the Wexford County sheriff's office but couldn't turn because he was going too fast.

Davenport eventually left the scene and reported to the Sheriff's office.

No one was injured except for the 21-year-old woman who suffered minor wounds after being dragged by Davenport's car as she attempted to escape.
