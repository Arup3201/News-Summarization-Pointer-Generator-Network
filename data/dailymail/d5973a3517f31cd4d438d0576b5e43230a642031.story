The 49-year-old daughter of a retired Supreme Court judge is facing cocaine trafficking charges.

Kristina Hampel's home in the luxury Melbourne suburb of South Yarra was raided on August 14 in the most recent controversy to hit the renowned legal family, The Age reports.

A Victoria police spokesperson confirmed to Daily Mail Australia that Prahran detectives had arrested a woman following a ‘long standing investigation into drug trafficking'.

The creative socialite daughter of former Supreme Court judge George Hampel, QC, was charged at 3pm on Thursday with four counts of trafficking cocaine after police executed a search warrant at her home in Macfarlan Street, South Yarra.

'Investigators also seized a large quantity of drugs and cash,’ police said. 

A family representative told The Age: ‘The family is aware of the charges. This is a difficult time for everyone. We will wait for the court process to take its normal course.’

Ms Hampel’s father is not only a QC, her stepmother is County Court judge Felicity Hampel, SC - one of Australia's most famous human rights lawyers.

On Ms Hampel's KRISTINA website she notes how she has worked as a fashion buyer, creative director, journalist and art curator among other jobs.

‘For 20 years I have freelanced across a broad spectrum of creative fields,’ she writes.

She was bailed by police to appear in Melbourne Magistrates Court on November 6.

Daily Mail Australia has contacted Ms Hampel for comment. 

Her father Professor George Hampel AM QC worked as a barrister since 1958 before becoming a Justice of the Supreme Court of Victoria from 1983 to 2000.

He was Vice-President of the Law Council of Australia and is also President of the International Institute of Forensic Studies, even reportedly training war crime prosecutors at The Hague.

He married Felicity Hampel SC, 20 years his junior and who shares his passion for accountability, almost 20 years ago.

In 2006, he was appointed a Member of the Order of Australia.

In 2010, their son Anthony Hampel’s girlfriend Phoebe Handsjuk died after falling 12 floors inside the garbage chute of an apartment building in St Kilda.

Detectives ruled the 24-year-old’s death was not suspicions.
