When it comes to cooking convent cuisine, nun do it better than Sister Lucia Caram.

The Dominican nun, from Catalonia, Spain, is so good, in fact, that she's been given her own cookery show on Spanish television... and is set to become the nation's next reality star.

On the programme, which starts next week, she cooks up a range of traditional monastery and convent food, adding a current touch to the recipes as well as some cooking tricks reflecting her Argentinian roots.

The daily show will feature on the Spanish 'Cooking Channel' where the nun has been interviewed ahead of her show.

She said: 'I am convinced that food brings people together, makes families, makes communities and that the table is a place of talk that can help people to share what they have in their hearts, and that it can transform our world.'

During the TV programmes the nun, who has also a twitter account where she writes about the economy and politics, will cook classics like anise doughnuts, local stews, her personal favourite of pumpkin with potato and also typical Argentinian pastries.

Although originally from Argentina, she now lives in Manresa, in the eastern Spanish province of Catalonia.

She was signed up for the show after she wrote some books including, 'My cloister is now my world', published in 2012, and 'God Helps'.

She has more than 54,000 followers on Twitter where she describes herself as a 'nun, restless in her pursuit of making others happy'.

News of her show comes just a week after Sister Cristina Scuccia, from Sicily, hit the spotlight after performing Alecia Keys' No One on Italy's version of The Voice.

The soul sister amazed the crowd and stunned judges when she performed her divine interpretation of the song.

Dressed in full religious regalia Sister Cristina Scuccia, who hails from mafia hotspot Sicily, managed to get all four chairs to turn around during her blind audition.

She was joined by three other nuns from her convent, and they were so delighted by her singing they jumped up and down with glee.

Explaining her decision to go on the show, the Ursuline Sisters of the Holy Family member told the panel: 'I have a gift and I'm giving it to you.'
