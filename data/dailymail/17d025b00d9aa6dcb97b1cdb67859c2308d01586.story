Christmas Eve is shaping up to be windy, wet and warm instead of white across much of the country, making for a travel nightmare for those heading to their holiday destinations.

While parts of the South cleaned up from severe storms that killed at least four people, a system that forecasters had feared could bring several inches of snow to Illinois, including the air travel hub of Chicago, was expected to track farther east.

Still, by early afternoon Wednesday, more than 280 flights had been canceled in the US, according to flight tracking service FlightAware. Chicago's O'Hare International Airport was hardest hit, accounting for 98 of the cancellations.

More than 4,300 departing and arriving flights - and counting - were facing delays Wednesday.

Several inches of slushy snow was still possible in the afternoon, mainly in areas southeast of Chicago along the Indiana state line and in far western Illinois.

That was similar to the forecast for Indiana, where the National Weather Service said 2-4 inches of snow could leave untreated roads and bridges slick.

Holiday travelers in Ohio, Michigan and New York faced the prospect of gusty weather.

A high wind warning was issued from Wednesday evening to Thursday morning for much of northern Ohio. Meteorologists warned that gusts of 65mph in western New York could blow away holiday decorations.

In Michigan, utility companies braced for extremely strong gales a year after a storm put thousands of people in the dark at Christmas.

The weather service said the strongest winds are expected at night and would last nearly until dawn on Christmas Day.

Crews are on standby Wednesday in anticipation of gusts of 45mph or higher in the Detroit area, said DTE Energy spokeswoman Randi Berris.

A light but steady rain fell Wednesday along much of the East Coast.

In northern New Jersey, forecasters warned thunderstorms could boom as temperatures head toward 60. A coastal flood advisory was in effect, and fog was predicted in the northern part of the state.

Still, some parts of the country were welcoming bona fide snow in time for Santa’s arrival.

Five to 10 inches was forecast in mountain passes and up to 3 inches on valley floors in Nevada's Sierras. And mountainous areas of Washington expected 3 to 5 inches to fall Wednesday.

Power companies struggled to restore electricity to thousands of people in Mississippi after severe weather killed at least four people, injured about 50, and damaged or destroyed an unknown number of homes and businesses, including a day care center.

In eastern Colorado, Interstate 70 was shut down into Kansas for eight hours because of strong winds and blowing snow. Parts of western South Dakota saw snow accumulations of a foot or more through Tuesday morning. Higher elevations in the Black Hills got close to 2 feet.

But not all winter weather lovers were so lucky.

Snow isn't expected in other parts of South Dakota until Friday. Sioux Falls resident Alana Amdahl said she's disappointed about the lack of snow projected for Christmas.

‘We live in South Dakota for a reason,’ said Amdahl, 27. ‘We don't have palm trees to put Christmas lights on, we have evergreens. Of course, we need snow. It can melt after the new year.’

The hospital in Marion County, Mississippi, had every room full when it lost electricity, forcing the staff to work off a generator, WDAM reported.

An additional 6,000 households throughout the state lost power, with damage to the electrical grid due to the severe weather.

Mississippi Power told The Associated Press about 300 customers were still without electricity by midday Wednesday, but most would have power by the end of the day. 

NBC reported that in addition to wind and rain, hail struck the state, with golf-ball sized hail falling in Enterprise, Mississippi, and pea-sized debris hitting 

A Walmart in Columbia was structurally damaged, with skylights blowing out and flooding reported. Vehicles parked outside were also damaged. 

Governor Phil Bryant, who toured the twister-stricken area by helicopter and by vehicle before the news conference, said state emergency officials believe the destruction was caused by a tornado.

Some 40 businesses and 30 homes were damaged in Columbia, Bryant said. About 10 to 15 buildings were damaged in the more rural Jones County.

Columbia Mayor Robert Bourne said the tornado straddled US 98, so damage was on both sides of the four-lane highway. Bryant had said earlier that the tornado cut a swath of about 3 to 3.5 miles long through Columbia and about a quarter of a mile wide.

Police in Columbia were stationed at all major intersections after traffic lights were either swept away or destroyed amid Tuesday's powerful storms. At least 20 people were injured, according to Mississippi Emergency Management Agency officials.

The roof was ripped off the building of the Jack Morris Gas Co., a natural gas supplier.

Wanda Morris, a family member who works in the company office, said she was watching TV when a weather warning was issued and the sirens went off in town. She said she gathered employees and customers, about 15 people in all, into a vault in the building, and they rode out the storm there.

‘When we heard the sirens the second time, I started yelling, 'Get into the vault! Get into the vault! And I ran outside and started yelling,’ she said.

Only one employee failed to make it into the vault in time and hid under a metal table. He sustained minor injuries.

Although the business itself was heavily damaged, a sign outside bearing the Ten Commandments was left completely intact.

In Alabama, authorities said thunderstorms left trees and power lines down across the state and flooded several roads. 

In the Great Lakes region, rain is expected to turn to snow later today, dropping several inches of slushy snow on parts of Illinois.

'I'd be nervous about the possibility of not being able to get out,' said meteorologist Charles Mott as Chicago airports geared up for more cancellations. 'I would definitely make plans about possibly staying put or doing something else.'

Fog, rain and drizzle contributed to flight delays and cancellations at the three New York City-area airports.

At New York's LaGuardia Airport, a Southwest airliner collided with an American Airlines plane, knocking off a piece of the Southwest plane's vertical fin just as it was taxiing for takeoff.

The American Airlines plane was taxiing with the help of two ground personnel, spokesperson Joshua Freed said in an email according to Fox News. No one was injured and the Southwest passengers were booked to other flights.

Washington, DC, Baltimore and Boston experienced delays though cancellations were low. Thunderstorms disrupted flights in Dallas/Fort Worth and Houston and Charlotte had 10 cancellations Wednesday in addition to numerous delays.

Snow in Wisconsin caused a three-vehicle crash that included a school bus, though no one was reported injured.

Strong winds and snow shut down Interstate 70 from eastern Colorado into Kansas for eight hours, and caused another Colorado highway to close temporarily.
