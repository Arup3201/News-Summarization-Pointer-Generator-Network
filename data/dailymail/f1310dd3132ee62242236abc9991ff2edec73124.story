Headteacher Martyn Keane admitted common assault by beating  after he said he reprimanded a 10-year-old boy and 'made contact with his chest'

A headteacher has admitted assaulting a 10-year-old pupil at a private primary school where fees cost more than £2,000 a term. 

Martyn Keane, 68, admitted a charge of assault by beating after he said he reprimanded the pupil at Gower House School in Kingsbury, London, and 'made contact with his chest.' 

Following the incident the local child protection officer, Met Police and Department for Education called for an emergency Ofsted inspection of the private school. Its measures for safeguarding children who report abuse were found to be inadequate.  

Keane, 68, denied claims that he had pulled the pupil's tie causing him to fall on the desk, but admitted he had made contact with the boy's chest.

District Judge Denis Brennan told Willesden Magistrates' Court the allegations about Keane pulling the boy's tie could not be established. He sentenced the headteacher - who has since retired - on the basis of his admissions to an assault by beating charge.

Keane, who is said to have retired from his position after court proceedings began, was given a six month conditional discharge for the offence. 

Willesden Magistrates' Court heard that police visited the private school after the boy complained to his mother. 

The court heard evidence from three child witnesses as well as the former headteacher during the case.

Gower House School is a private school for children from the age of two to 11. Termly fees for children aged seven and over cost £2,260. 

The school was established in 1951 and on its website is described as 'a well established school known to be one of the best out of the many private schools in north London.' 

Keane admitted a charge of common assault by beating at a hearing at Willesden Magistrates' Court 

An order was initially imposed under the Children and Young Person Act 1933 banning the publication of the name of the school, the victim and any child witnesses. 

This was partially lifted following an application by the Evening Standard, allowing the school and headteacher to be identified. 

Keane, of Berkhamstead, Hertfordshire, was also ordered to pay a victim surcharge of £15 and costs of £85.
