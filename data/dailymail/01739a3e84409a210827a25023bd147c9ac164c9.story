Even when he was the new boy on the block at Everton, it didn’t take much to wind Wayne Rooney up on the training ground. He played every game to win it.

And the status and age of the player didn’t matter if he wasn’t happy with you. You’d know about it if you were on the receiving end of his tongue or one of his bad-tempered, x-rated challenges.

Wayne was often reprimanded for flying in during training matches but it was always a pleasure to see him in full anger mode. There aren’t many like him so he was a breath of fresh air.

Love him or hate him, he is at his best when he shows that little bit of devilment and passion, although there are times when he oversteps the mark and he does have to calm down.

He should have been sent off at Cardiff recently and he could have been sent off at Hull on Thursday if Michael Oliver had been stronger and more alert.

There were times when he tried to bully the referee and, for such an influential and leading player, he has a responsibility to set a better example to young football fans.

His manager also knows when he channels that anger into his football, no team can handle him and he wins matches for Manchester United. They are still in this title race and it’s mainly down to Wayne Rooney.

Chelsea obviously got a lot of positive signs in the summer that he was willing to leave Old Trafford and they were prepared to pay big money make the transfer happen. There may have been a bit of mischief from Jose Mourinho initially, but he knew what a difference Rooney would make to the squad he inherited.

But David Moyes had different ideas. And it’s just as well.

Imagine Wayne Rooney in the Chelsea team. They would be 10 points clear at the top of the table, title in the bag.

David knew he had to do everything to keep one of his real stars out of the clutches of his main rivals.

We all saw the devastating impact Robin van Persie’s exit from Arsenal had on those two teams last season. And imagine Arsenal this season with a full fit van Persie now.

No Chelsea striker has scored away from home for more than a year and Rooney has scored more goals than Torres, Ba and Eto’o combined. How he would have thrived from the service of Mata, Hazard, Willian, Lampard or Oscar.

I am always reluctant to use the phrase `one man team’ and that would be unfair on other players in the Manchester United side this season who have performed, but Rooney’s performances remind me of Steven Gerrard in the season Liverpool won the Champions League.

This season he has inspired his team-mates and have dragged them through matches. They have lost one in the last nine, and that just happened to be at home to Newcastle United, when Rooney was suspended for reaching five bookings.

Rooney was not the same player last season. He was left out of key games, like the Champions League clash with Real Madrid, and his subsequent disagreement and unhappiness was with Alex Ferguson, not his successor.

My understanding is that the pair were reconciled after Rooney left Everton for Old Trafford but of course they didn’t have the benefit of working together to show that to everyone else.

David had to wait until he took over from Ferguson to get that one-to-one contact and clearly had numerous meetings to convince Rooney that he would be a key figure in his team.

Players will be sacrificed as the club goes through a rebuilding process but he has recognised Wayne’s talents and I think he will have been looking forward to working with him again, and getting the best out of him, after giving him his debut at Everton and helping to nurture him in those early days.

Issues: Last season, under the management of Sir Alex Ferguson, Rooney was left out of key games

Rooney has been playing in his favourite and most effective position, in the number 10 role, which also happens to be the number on his back. And with good reason. He is the perfect fit.

He is one of those players who could genuinely play in every position, and he has an array of passes up there with the very best.

But he has the most influence in that central area where he has the dynamic to use the freedom to create chances for others, and get behind the defence to score goals, or force defenders like James Chester to put in their own net. He also showed at Hull that he can score goals outside the box.

Hull took full advantage of Manchester United’s poor start at the KC Stadium. The United bus was late, and the team looked like they were still sat in their seats for the first 10 minutes when they went two down.

They conceded poor goals, and Rooney was one of the guilty parties for Chester’s opening goal.

But when he has that devil working overtime, he has the ability to change matches. Hull found that to their cost, and plenty of others will in the title run-in.

Change isn't always the answer, just ask Wolves

Malky Mackay inevitably became the latest manager to lose his job on Friday.

Cardiff City owner Vincent Tan is gambling with his club’s Premier League status by appointing a new manager at this crucial point of the season.

If, as seems likely, he turns to Ole Gunnar Solksjaer to keep the club up, he is employing a young coach with an excellent reputation, forged back in Norway, but with absolutely no experience of top flight management in English football.

Since the start of the season, several clubs have pushed the panic button and, in fairness, they have seen a positive response.

Tony Pulis, for all the criticism of his style of play at Stoke City, took Crystal Palace out of the bottom three this week and he has undoubtedly made a difference to a team which looked doomed two months ago.

Pulis has never been relegated and gets results, even if it isn’t always pretty, by organising his team and playing to their strengths. The wins for Palace so far have been typical of the type he gained at Stoke.

Martin Jol was another manager who seemed to be harshly treated by Fulham.

But Rene Meulensteen has found a way to get performances out of Taarabt, Kasami and Ruiz and even Berbatov, before he was injured.

And although they remain bottom, there are signs of improvement at Sunderland too under Gus Poyet.

The win at Everton was arguably the best win in midweek. Sunderland looked solid and well organised at Goodison and restricted the home side to long range efforts.

While there are some positive signs at those clubs, sacking the manager and appointing a new man is not always guaranteed to bring success. Just ask Wolves.

Would Wolves be in the division they are in now if they had shown some loyalty and faith in Mick McCarthy? I doubt it. Ipswich moved into seventh this week as Mick continues to work his magic in the Championship and prove once again he can get teams out of that division – at the right end.

West Brom have taken a similar path to their neighbours and are also on the brink of bringing in a foreign manager with no experience of the Premier League. Steve Clarke may have had a wretched record over the calendar year, but I suspect the West Brom players would be more comfortable with the man they know.

The board at West Ham must be watching all this with great interest, particularly after slipping into the bottom three this week. And I just hope they are strong enough to stand by Sam Allardyce and show the loyalty he needs.

There is clearly some discontent among the owners about the Andy Carroll transfer.

They need goals and he’s not going to score them from the treatment room. Carroll came with poor injury record and spending £16million on him was always going to be a gamble because managers are judged on their signings, as much as results.

The sooner he is fit, the better because Carroll being unavailable is putting Sam under more pressure.

But the funny thing is, if you were looking for a manager with experience and the know-how to keep a team up, you wouldn’t look much further than Sam Allardyce.

I just hope West Ham realise they have the right man in the job.

Gus Poyet

I made my Sunderland debut at Everton in 1999, three years after they last won there. We lost 5-1.

To go to Everton and end their record of remaining unbeaten at Goodison Park in 2013 was a fantastic achievement by Sunderland. They just have to do it more consistently to have any chance of survival.

Martin Skrtel

Since when did the Liverpool defender take up WWE?

In the last two games, the Slovak has
 been blatantly pulling opponents’ shirts at set pieces and wrestling 
with them before the ball is anywhere near.

It has been highlighted so much that he needs to cut it out or face the consequences of conceding penalties.
