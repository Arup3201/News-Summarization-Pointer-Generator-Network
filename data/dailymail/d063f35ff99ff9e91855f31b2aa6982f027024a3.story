Two officers have been removed from their posts at an infamous Princeton University eating club after they sent emails ridiculing women, including one that featured a sexually explicit photograph.

Adam Krop, who is the vice president of the club Tiger Inn, sent an email on October 12 showing a woman engaged in a sex act with a man at the club. It went to everyone on the club's mailing list and was accompanied by a crude joke and a reference to the woman as an 'Asian chick'.

Andrew Hoffenberg, the club's treasurer, sent an email to the same group of people later that evening regarding a lecture by the Princeton alumna whose lawsuit forced eating clubs to admit women.

According to The New York Times it said: 'Ever wonder who we have to thank (blame) for gender equality. 

'Looking for someone to blame for the influx of girls? Come tomorrow and help boo Sally Frank.'

Last month the Princeton Police Department said they were investigating the first email as it is illegal in New Jersey to distribute an explicit photograph without the consent of the person pictured.

But yesterday the department said the case was essentially on-hold until a 'victim comes forward'.

However, the university launched its own investigation.

And amid complaints from members that the emails were evidence of a climate that is hostile towards women, the club's board of governors conducted a survey asking members if they would be surprised if a sexual assault had occurred at the club.

The board then notified members that Mr Krop and Mr Hoffenberg had been asked to stand down as their actions were 'offensive, disrespectful and in direct violation of our core values'.

It said the board would now be more 'balanced by gender' and a new process would be developed so incidents of concern could be more safely reported. 

Neither Mr Krop or Mr Hoffenberg have spoken about the emails. 

It is understood the survey found the majority of members were comfortable at the club, but 'gender bias' had occurred at a number of specific events and ceremonies. 

The Princeton University email scandal comes as the treatment of female students at campuses across the U.S. has come under greater scrutiny.

Last month the Princeton Police Department said they were investigating the first email as it is illegal in New Jersey to distribute an explicit photograph without the consent of the person pictured, but yesterday the department said the case was on-hold until a 'victim comes forward'

A fraternity gang rape has been reported in Virginia, and on Monday, Wesleyan University announced a ban on social activity for a fraternity where sexual assaults were reported. The federal Education Department is investigating sexual violence cases at 90 institutions of higher learning.

Princeton's 11 eating clubs are not officially affiliated with the university, but they are the center of social activity for undergraduate students. 

Tiger Inn is infamous for its hard-partying atmosphere. It was also the last to admit women, in 1991, after being forced by the Supreme Court.

Since then women have joined the club, but it is still a male dominated club. Some Tiger Inn attire bears the words 'more dudes' and club nights have had provocative themes. 

Last month, someone spray-painted the words 'rape haven' on the club's stone fence.
