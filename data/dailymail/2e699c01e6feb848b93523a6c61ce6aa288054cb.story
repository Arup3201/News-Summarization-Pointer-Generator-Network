Tim Krul was brought on in the last minute of extra-time JUST for the penalty shootout

Louis van Gaal has been lauded for his decision to bring on goalkeeper Tim Krul ahead of Holland’s penalty-shootout victory over Costa Rica – but was he inspired by Paul Sturrock?

The Dutch boss replaced netminder Jasper Cillessen in the 120th minute of Saturday’s quarter-final in Salvador.

And Newcastle stopper Krul proved the shootout hero, saving two penalties to set up a semi-final date with Argentina.

Van Gaal later admitted that it was always part of his plan to use his reserve keeper.

‘We thought it through. Every player has certain skills and qualities and they don’t always coincide,’ he said.

‘We
 felt Tim would be the most appropriate keeper to save penalties. You 
would have seen that Tim dived to the right corner twice. We’re a tiny 
bit proud this trick has helped us through.’

But Van Gaal is not the first manager to pull such a stroke of genius.

Former Southend boss Sturrock upset his No.1 Paul Smith when he was replaced by 19-year-old Daniel Bentley in the closing stages of the Johnstone’s Paint Trophy Southern Area semi-final against Oxford in 2013.

Mastermind: Paul Sturrock brought on Bentley especially for the penalty shootout

But Bentley, like Krul, emerged as the hero when he kept out Oxford’s Alfie Potter to help send the Shrimpers through.

Smith, though, had not been aware of Sturrock’s plan, and the manager said: ‘I probably should have told my goalie before the game it was going to happen.

‘Bentley has been fantastic at penalties all his career, and it worked, he saved one.’

Southend were beaten 2-0 by Crewe in the final, by which point Sturrock had been replaced by Phil Brown.

But Sturrock had been the brains behind the passage to Wembley – we wonder if Mr Van Gaal was watching all the while?
