A remote controlled plane has serendipitously captured stunning footage of marine life after it lost control and plunged into the ocean.

The RC plane pilot was hovering above the water at Exmouth, West Australia, when the glare from the sun caused him to lose his bearings and lose control of the toy, reports ninemsn.

The clip, which took place just before Christmas, shows the twin-prop plane spinning wildly around with sweeping views of the ocean, before it crashes into the water.

The plane is promptly greeted by a plethora of curious marine life.

A school of Yellowfin Bream  circle the camera, while a majestic turtle glides underneath.

After bobbing up and down in the water, the plane can be seen sinking towards the coral laden seabed as the vision fades into black.

The clip echoes another recent video from Amsterdam, which saw a desperate drone owner run into chest-deep water to rescue his flawed device seconds before it fell into a lake.

Zwier Spanjer, 26, had taken the drone out on its first flight to record a residential area in Amsterdam.

But when it began to plummet, the alarmed owner raced in to the water fully clothed and rescued the £650 camera just in time.
