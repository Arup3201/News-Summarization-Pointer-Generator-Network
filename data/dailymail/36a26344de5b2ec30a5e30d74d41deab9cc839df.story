Aston Villa boss Paul Lambert has called for a winter break and insists it would benefit English clubs.

The Scot has added his name to a growing list who want the Barclays Premier League to stop over Christmas.

Jose Mourinho, Gus Poyet and Wayne Rooney have all insisted a break would be good for the game.

Aston Villa manager Paul Lambert said he thinks a winter break in the Premier League would be a good idea 

Lambert is not alone in his beliefs and is joined by fellow Premier League manager Jose Mourinho of Chelsea

Sunderland manager Gus Poyet has also showed his dislike for the fixtures over the festive period

Villa host Crystal Palace on New Year's Day, their third match in less than a week, and then face Blackpool in the FA Cup on Sunday.

And, ahead of the Eagles' visit, Lambert is keen to see a league hiatus during winter.

'From a manager's point of view, I guarantee if you went up and down the country and did a survey on it, I'm pretty sure 99 per-cent of managers and staff and players would want the break,' he said.

'I guarantee you fans would enjoy it, too.

'Fans up and down the country are brilliant. They follow their teams everywhere. I have no issues with that.

Lambert commended the Aston Villa fans for their efforts to travel to watch games over the Christmas period

'My point of view is that you will have a lot better quality in the second half of the season with a break.

'I just think it would help everybody, the national team, everything.

'You're asking the players to play (again) in two days. You're not going to get the best quality from the game.

'It's difficult to do that 48 hours after playing a tough game.'

Villa are 13th in the table after their 0-0 draw with Sunderland on Sunday and host Palace who could have Alan Pardew in charge by the time they come to Villa Park.

Villa striker Gabriel Agbonlahor will return from suspension following his red card against Manchester United

Lambert is without the suspended Fabian Delph and injured Ashley Westwood and Nathan Baker (both knee).

Gabby Agbonlahor is back after a ban and Joe Cole is available following a hamstring injury but the club will assess Tom Cleverley (foot) and Ciaran Clark (back).

Lambert played for Borussia Dortmund between 1996 and 1997 and had a winter break and reckons it would help the players' fitness.

'I had a long break when I played in Germany and it was fantastic,' he told the Birmingham Mail.

'You shut down and everyone comes back refreshed and ready for a massive push in the second half of the season.

'It's brilliant for everybody.

'People think footballers are super-human but they're normal guys.

'If you're selling a product to millions of people you sell it when everybody is fresh.

'Games come thick and fast and you have to manage players and get them through games.

'You look at them and see that they're tired but they have to go again. It is what it is.

'From a player's point of view you try to get them in the best condition they can be in to play two games in two days but it's hard.'
