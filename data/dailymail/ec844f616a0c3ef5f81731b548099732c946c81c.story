The relocation of a senior politico has seemingly ended the Obama administration's aims to close Guantanamo Bay, despite statements to the contrary

The special envoy responsible for overseeing the closure of the U.S. prison at Guantanamo Bay has been taken off the job in a clear sign that the Obama administration no longer plans to shut the facility down.

On Monday the State Department reassigned Daniel Fried, the special envoy for closing the Cuban prison and will not replace him, according to an internal personnel announcement seen by The New York Times.

His office will be closed and his former responsibilities, mainly working on diplomatic issues surrounding the relocation of detainees, will be folded into the office of the department’s legal adviser.

The move seems to show that the Obama administration does not see the closing of the prison as a realistic priority, despite announcements by the President to the contrary.

Mr. Fried will now work on issues including Iran and Syria as the department’s coordinator for sanctions policy.

Mr. Fried’s special envoy post was created in 2009, shortly after Mr Obama took office and promised to close the prison in his first year. He traveled the world negotiating the repatriation of some 31 low-level detainees and persuading third-party countries to resettle about 40 who were cleared for release but could not be sent home because of fears of abuse.

But as Congress imposed restrictions on further transfers, Mr Fried was eventually assigned to also work on resettling a group of Iranian exiles, the M.E.K., who were in a refugee camp in Iraq.

Ian Moss, a spokesman for Mr. Fried’s office, said:'We remain committed to closing Guantánamo, and doing so in a responsible fashion.

Housed on a naval base in Cuba, the camp was set up to hold suspected terrorists captured on the battlefields of Afghanistan in early 2002A number of scandals have hit the site over its 10-year history.

Allegations of mistreatment at the camp surfaced early on and the U.S. has faced frequent attacks from human rights groups for holding inmates without trial.

The U.S. claim the prisoners are 'enemy combatants' who do not have the same rights of prisoners of war or U.S. citizens.

There have also been numerous reports of inmates being tortured at the hands of their American captors.

Three detainees committed suicide in 2006, although there were other failed attempts before that.

During his 2008 campaign, Mr Obama described Guantanamo as a 'sad chapter in American history' and said the U.S. legal system was equipped to handle the detainees.

According to the US authorities, 779 detainees have been held in Guantanamo and all but one of the 779 detainees were foreign nationals.

As of December 2011, 171 men from more than 20 countries were still held at Guantanamo.

'The administration continues to express its opposition to Congressional restrictions that impede our ability to implement transfers.'

The announcement came as Khalid Shaikh Mohammed and four other Guantánamo Bay detainees appeared before a military tribunal over the September 11 attacks.

They made their first public appearance since October on Monday, sitting quietly in a high-security courtroom at the naval base in Cuba as pretrial hearings resumed.

The five men were arraigned back in May of last year.

Yesterday one of the prisoners fired one of his military attorneys in an apparent sign of distrust of his Pentagon-appointed legal counsel.

Waleed bin Attash at first refused to speak when questioned by the judge about his desire to dismiss one of his three lawyers, Marine Corps Maj. William Hennessy.

He hinted at his motivation later in an exchange with the judge about whether he wished to attend future sessions of the court.

'We have been dealing with our attorneys for about a year and a half and we have not been able to get any trust with them,' the Yemeni said through an Arabic translator.

The dismissal of the attorney came at the start of what is expected to be a four-day hearing to address a wide range of pre-trial legal issues.

Bin Attash is one of the lesser figures among the five defendants in the case.

He allegedly ran an al-Qaida training camp in Afghanistan where two of the 19 hijackers in the terrorist attacks trained.

He is also believed to have been a bodyguard for Osama bin Laden.

Defendants in the military tribunal have civilian counsel in addition to military lawyers. Khalid Sheikh Mohammed, who has portrayed himself as the mastermind of the Sept. 11 attacks, added an additional death penalty specialist, California lawyer Gary Sowards, to his team Monday.
