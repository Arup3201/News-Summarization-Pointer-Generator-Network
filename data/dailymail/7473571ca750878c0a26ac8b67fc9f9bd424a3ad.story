Around 40 per cent of a typical public toilet is contaminated by bacteria and viruses, with just one germ multiplying eight million times in eight hours.

But a new hand dryer claims to be the first to kill up to 99 per cent of this potentially deadly bacteria quickly and effectively.

Called the Sterillo, it uses a technology known as 'UV plasma' to blitz all the dangerous airborne molecules inside a room.

There she blows: A new hand dryer called Sterillo (pictured) claims to be the first to kill up to 99 per cent of potentially deadly germs. It uses a form of UV light to blitz all the bacteria inside a room

The technology is already used in ambulances and care homes to kill infections, but in the form of a hand dryer can tackle unsanitary conditions in bathrooms.

The device uses technology discovered in the 1920s, called dual wave UVC light. 

This is a form of UV light and is already used in hospitals and to purify water in fish tanks.

The device makes use of two wavelengths to kill the viruses. 

A lamp in the hand dryer creates a type of oxygen molecule called oxygen radicals.

Such molecules are found naturally and are nature’s way of cleaning. 

Plasma is blasted from the dryer and destroys the germs. 

This can eradicate airborne infections  such as Salmonella, E-Coli, MRSA and Hepatitis A.

It can eradicate airborne infections that lurk in toilets such as Salmonella, E-Coli, MRSA and Hepatitis A, and inventor Steve Levy said the dryer could also benefit schools and offices.

The unit costs just under £500 ($740). 

It contains a 'UVC plasma technology' unit that silently destroys bacteria in a room ‘every second of every day’.

Mr Levy told MailOnline that the device uses technology discovered in the 1920s, called dual wave UVC light.

This is a form of UV light which is already used in hospitals and to purify water in fish tanks, for example.

‘Plasma comes out and goes around the room destroying germs,’ Mr Levy said.

Mr Levy explained that inside buildings there are fewer self-cleaning molecules than outdoors, which helps create the perfect environment for germs to breed.

He said Sterillo's technology is harmless to humans and that the dryer produces lower levels of radicals than are found outside.

‘Bringing them inside can kill germs and bugs that are not around outside,’ he continued. 

There is an added bonus of the device eradicating unpleasant smells too, as well as any mould.
