Looking at Sharon Maughan, it's hard to believe it's been more than ten years since she starred in the famous Nescafe Gold Blend coffee adverts.

The 63-year-old actress appeared fresh faced and slim as she stepped out of the luxurious Chateau Marmont Hotel on Sunset Boulevard in Los Angeles in a beige trench 
coat with loose-fitting khaki trousers and a white shirt with daughter Alice Eve. 

The mother-of-three is visiting her daughter, 31, who has been spending more and more time in LA since starring in the latest Star Trek film.

They were joined by Eve's Star Trek 
co-star Zachary Quinto, 36, who decided to keep his outfit low key with beige chinos, a navy blue and grey jumper with a matching navy blue hat and 
trainers.

Eve also opted for the casual look in a red knitted jumper over a 
white shirt and black slacks.

It appears the pair have managed to keep up their friendship since starring together in the latest £120 million Star Trek movie which was a big box office hit.

Quinto has starred as Spock in the last two Star Trek movies.

Oxford-educated Eve starred as Dr Carol Marcus, the new love interest of Starfleet Captain James T Kirk, played by Chris Pine, in Star Trek Into Darkness.

The star was immersed in controversy when fans complained about a gratuitous scene where she appears in her underwear.

Producer Damon Lindelof used his Twitter
account to say sorry for the clip which has been deemed 'misogynistic' 
and unnecessary by some viewers.

He posted: 'I copped to the fact that we should have done a better job of not being gratuitous in our representation of a barely clothed actress.'

But Eve simply said at the time: ‘I’m not the classic Hollywood shape. I don’t want to have to fight to be taken seriously.’

Eve gained the part after ‘two long, lonely years’  failing to land a major acting role.

She is the only one out of Maughan's three children with husband Trevor Eve to follow her into acting.

Maughan has starred in several television series including The Main Chance, Shabby Tiger, By the Sword Divided, The Enigma Files and The Flame Trees of Thika. She has worked in theatre, television and film including Dombey and Son, Inspector Morse, A Doll's House, Arcadia and Another Stakeout.

But she is best known for starring in
the popular Gold Blend couple television advertisements for Nescafé 
Gold Blend instant coffee between 1987 to 1992 alongside actor Anthony Head.

Her husband Trevor Eve appeared as Maughan's ex-husband in the 
famous television advertisements for Nescafé Gold Blend coffee (known as
Taster's Choice in the USA).

From 2003 to 2006 she had a regular role as Nurse Tricia Williams in the BBC One medical drama television series Holby City.

She also appeared in the 2010 U.S. 
film She's Out of My League, in the role of Molly's mother, the lead 
female character played by real life daughter Alice.

Her husband, Trevor Eve, played Molly's father.

Maughan was also a participant in the 2011 series of Celebrity MasterChef and 
completed three films in 2012 - The Babymakers directed by Jay 
Chandrakauser; Flying Home directed by Dominique Derrudiere and Time 
Lapse.
