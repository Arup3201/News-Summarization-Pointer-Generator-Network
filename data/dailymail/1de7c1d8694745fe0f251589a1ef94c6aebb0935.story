A known sex offender has been charged with the death of a female friend whose body was found in a ravine 25 years ago.

Gabriel Rey O'Neill, 45, was charged with 
murder and the special circumstances of committing murder in the course 
of a rape, a kidnapping and an act of forced oral copulation, according to authorities on Monday.

Hikers found the body of 27-year-old Sheila Lorraine Hatcher, a mother-of-three, in a ravine on San Bruno Mountain in San Mateo County, California, on March 12, 1989.

Gabriel O'Neill, 45, has been charged with raping and murdering 27-year-old Sheila Lorraine Hatcher in California 25 years ago

Sheriff's
 Deputy Rebecca Rosenblatt said that Hatcher had been sexually assaulted and 
suffered blunt force trauma.

Investigators at the time were unable to 
find sufficient evidence to identify a suspect.

Last year, the victim's family asked sheriff's investigators to reopen the cold case.

According to the San Francisco Chronicle, investigators discovered that O'Neill, Hatcher and three other people went to the mountain to use drugs.

The group separated, leaving O'Neill alone with Hatcher. O'Neill, then 20, allegedly attacked, raped and killed Miss Hatcher and stole her jewellery. The exact relationship between the victim and O'Neill is still being established.

After investigators pored over old records and case files, Rosenblatt said that evidence was resubmitted to the forensics lab which linked O'Neill to the killing. The officer would not elaborate further as the investigation is ongoing.

Deputy Rosenblatt told MailOnline today that she had no details on the family's reaction to the potential solving of the murder but added: 'It always feels good when you can finally give a family some closure.'

The suspect, who lives in Brisbane, had not been part of the original investigation. O'Neill is a registered sex offender, according to the San Jose Mercury News.

O'Neill was taken into custody on Monday. If convicted, O'Neill could face the death penalty or life in prison without parole. Prosecutors have yet to make a decision on whether to seek lethal injection.

The accused was booked into the Maguire Correctional Facility in Redwood City and is being held without bail.
