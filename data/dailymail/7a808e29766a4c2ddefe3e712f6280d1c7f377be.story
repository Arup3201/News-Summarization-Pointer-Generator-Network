The Raheem Sterling 'tired' saga appears certain to return after South Africa banned a midfielder for missing a training camp due to fatigue.

South Africa coach Ephraim Mashaba claims May Mahlangu sent him an email telling him he was tired having played lots of games recently and therefore needed to skip the camp in order to rest.

He has subsequently been told he will no longer be called-up for the international side in future.

Raheem Sterling, warming up during the first-half in Estonia, complained of feeling tired in training for England

Liverpool star Sterling, meanwhile, was left out of England's starting XI to face Estonia in Tallinn last month after complaining of feeling tired.

Three Lions boss Roy Hodgson revealed before the game that Sterling has complained 'a little about being tired and was not at his best.'

Sterling's absence from the starting line-up led to much debate to whether or not a young footballer should be revealing he is 'tired' before a match. 

The 19-year-old didn't complete training on the Saturday night, starting the Estonia qualifier on the bench

Dennis Mumble, South Africa Football Association chief executive, said of Mashaba: 'We will not tolerate an individual who does not take national call-ups seriously.' 

Mashaba had been expected to be in South Africa's squad to face Sudan and Nigeria on Saturday and next Wednesday respectively.

He will not feature in their final two African Cup of Nations qualifiers now, however. 

Mahlangu, pictured for the national team in 2013, emailed the South African coach to pull out of squad
