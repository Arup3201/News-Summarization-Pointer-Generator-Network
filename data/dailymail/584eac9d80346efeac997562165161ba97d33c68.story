Convicted: Aadil Asghar, 25, was found guilty after killing 12-year-old schoolboy Harsh Dharmendra

A boy racer in a sports car killed a schoolboy after weaving in and out of heavy traffic and hurtling down a bus lane.

Aadil Asghar was told he faces a jail sentence after hitting and killing 12-year-old Harsh Dharmendra who was crossing the road on his way home from school.

The boy was thrown 10ft into the air by the force of the impact and landed in the back of a car just yards away from his home.

Tragically the pedestrian crossing where he had attempted to cross was not working at the time he was hit. 

He died in hospital the next day.

The jury was told the 25-year-old driver had been cutting across lanes in a bid to get ahead of traffic and was in the designated bus lane when he struck the schoolboy.

He was also estimated to be travelling over 40mph in his white Audi A1, emblazoned with grey racing stripes, on the road which is a designated 30mph zone.

The jury heard one driver warned 'he's going to kill someone' as Asghar cut up cars just moments before the fatal crash.

Alan Blake, prosecuting, said: 'The collision was the culmination of aggressive and impatient driving as the defendant drove his vehicle in heavy traffic proceeding out of Reading.'

'When Harsh stepped out in to the bus lane there was no prospect of the defendant being able to bring his vehicle to a stop,' he added.

In court: A jury at Reading Crown Court convicted Aadil Asghar of causing death by dangerous driving

Witness Katie Herd was driving home from work in her Audi A3 on the day of the boy's tragic collision and said she saw Asghar's Audi 'weaving in and out of the traffic.' 

Asghar admitted causing death by careless driving but contested a more serious charge of death by dangerous driving.

However, a jury at Reading Crown Court convicted him of causing death by dangerous driving on February 21 last year in King's Road, Reading, Berks.

He was released on conditional bail and will be sentenced on April 11 by Judge Stephen John.
