Fish is off the menu at Downton Abbey after ‘dinners’ served up for the TV series left the stately home reeking – and the actors feeling distinctly queasy.

Mrs Patmore would no doubt be scandalised but the meals masquerading as fish, camouflaged with white sauce, are now sculpted pieces of chicken fillet which pass muster onscreen without leaving any lingering and distinctive odour.

Julian Fellowes, the show’s creator, has been keen that costumes, props and even the food are as historically accurate as possible.

Fowl play: Lord Grantham and Lady Mary tuck in to chicken disguised as fish using white sauce and mushrooms

But when real fish was served in the first series, the cast became nauseous, and the rooms were left stinking, according to Hugh Bonneville, who plays Lord Grantham.

‘In the first season, when we had fish it really was fish,’ he said.

‘But if you put fish on the table at 8am when you start shooting it doesn’t smell so good in a few hours.

'It was pretty bad, especially when we were shooting in summer, with the windows blacked out, pretending it was night.

'The combination got pretty heady by mid-afternoon. It was queasy.

Since the first season, no clear shots of fish have appeared after the genuine meals left rooms stinking

Makeover: Food stylist Lisa Heathcote has a menu of food that is historically accurate but mild in smell

‘Our food consultant is very clever about how she disguises “fish”. It always looks and tastes delicious, but it isn’t the dish the audience thinks we’re eating. It’s chicken.’

Lisa Heathcote, Downton’s food stylist, conceded she used a range of tricks to enable the food to taste good, stay fresh, and look appetising.

‘The food must be appealing to the eye, historically accurate and well behaved. After all, the actors have to eat it,’ she said.

Late night filming was particularly smelly as they were forced to keep the windows shut

‘The fish incidents did happen, but outside my watch – I’ve been working with food and filming for too long to ever use real fish.

'I prepare “chicken fish” – chicken fillets covered in white sauce with mushrooms – to look like fish fillets, and “cheesy fish” – cream cheese, cottage cheese and Marie Rose sauce and lemon – to replicate the salmon mousse that was so popular once Daisy worked out how to use the food mixer.’

All the food eaten by the servants is real, too, with Lisa using Mrs Beeton’s Household Management and Mrs Marshall’s cookery books.

‘Downstairs characters have more simple fare, but it’s all real,’ says Lisa.
