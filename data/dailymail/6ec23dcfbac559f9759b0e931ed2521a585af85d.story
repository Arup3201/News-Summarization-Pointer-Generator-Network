Behind bars: Jamal Dyce was jailed for life in 2008 for stabbing to death labourer Philip Armstrong

A murderer has posted photos of himself larking around in jail on Facebook - before using the site to ask friends to send him more phone credit.

Jamal Dyce, who was jailed for life in 2008 for fatally stabbing a man, has taken to the social-networking site to brag about his life at HMP Gartree in Leicester.

The 25-year-old boasts about how he drinks alcohol, 'bulks up' at the gym and watches football matches behind bars.

He also speaks to friends on a Blackberry mobile phone - exchanging messages and joking about how easy it is to acquire drugs in prison.

Dyce was jailed for a minimum of 12 years in 2008 for stabbing to death labourer Philip Armstrong in a fight over a mobile phone.

But despite Dyce's sentence, he has posted numerous photos of himself on Facebook, including images of him cuddling his mother at the prison. 

In another photo, the killer can be seen being lifted up by a man he calls 'Dog'.

And in a string of Facebook posts - all posted via mobile phone - Dyce boasts about watching Champions League football and Match of the Day on TV, tucking into a beef curry and going to the gym.

He has even taken to the social-networking site to ask his friends to send him a £5 T-Mobile top-up card.

Among Dyce's posts are several written 
during Barcelona's 4-0 win against AC Milan in the Champions League on 
March 12 this year.

The posts read: 'Lionel Messi scoring screamers... Normal service is resumed' and 'Xavi is over 300 passes ahead in the champions league but people still tryna say he over rated imagine that?!'

Meanwhile, a comment on February 22 states: 'I need £5 T-mobile credit right now, so if your near a shop get at me please ya done know.'

And in one post, Dyce complains about James Corden and Nick Grimshaw's TV appearance on February 20 - writing: 'James corden and that grimshaw guy have ruined my t.v watching experience with their fag antics.'

Shocking: The murderer also brags about taking drugs, drinking and his plans to 'get stoned' over Christmas

Dyce also brags about taking drugs, drinking and his plans to 'get stoned' over Christmas, according to the Croydon Advertiser.

This week, a spokesman for the Ministry of Justice said it was 'totally unacceptable' for prisoners to have access to social networking sites.

He said: 'The Justice Secretary has made clear it is totally unacceptable for prisoners to access social networking sites.

'Those who break the rules will be dealt with severely and no prisoner should be in any doubt that if they are found with a mobile phone or any other illicit items they will be stripped of their privileges and reported to the police for further action.'
