The Leveson Inquiry was under fire tonight after claims Scotland Yard gagged it over extraordinary allegations against a senior officer.

Fresh questions emerged about its effectiveness as it emerged a report detailing suspicions that the officer was leaking to the News of the World was withheld.

The London force claimed a 'public interest immunity certificate' to ban the disclosure of paperwork accusing the officer of obtaining confidential information.

It is not clear whether the bid was 
successful, but the document was withheld anyway until after its 
contents could have been useful in public hearings.

Tonight Met Commissioner Sir Bernard Hogan-Howe faced calls to 'urgently review' the extraordinary development.

Labour MP Tom Watson said the claims of a cover-up were 'remarkably serious' as the disclosure prompted a furious war of words.

He said: 'As the Prime Minster has 
said, this inquiry was supposed to have left no stone unturned but it 
now appears to have been gagged by the very force it was set up to 
investigate.

'I'm sure the current Commissioner 
would wish to urgently review what happened and I will be writing to the
Home Secretary Theresa May to ask that she satisfies herself that all 
seemingly vital documents from the Yard were not withheld from Lord 
Justice Leveson.'

At the centre of the row is a Met intelligence report from 2006 which accuses a former senior officer of leaking for cash.

The information allegedly passed on to
the now-defunct Sunday tabloid supposedly related to the stewardship of
the then Commissioner Lord Blair.

Scotland Yard is accused of 
withholding the document from the Leveson Inquiry until after those 
involved could have been questioned on its contents in public.

In a statement, Robert Jay QC, counsel
to the inquiry, confirmed that Scotland Yard had claimed 'public 
interest immunity' in relation to the internal intelligence report.

Asked why he did not question senior 
officers about it, he replied that the inquiry was not shown the police 
report until April 23 last year.

This was seven weeks after a raft of police officers including Lord Stevens, Lord Blair and Sir Paul Stephenson were quizzed.

Mr Jay, who is poised to become a High
Court judge, said the inquiry had a continuing 'obligations of 
confidence' to the police in relation to their submissions.

He added: 'These factors have at all stages limited what I am able to place in the public domain, and continue to do so.'

The inquiry into press ethics started in November 2011 and held evidence-gathering hearings for nine months.

An entire section was devoted to examining the relationship between the press and the police after a series of scandals.

When Lord Justice Leveson published his report he criticised the Met for errors in its handling of the phone-hacking scandal.

He also accused it of fostering a 'perception' that some senior officers were too close to News International.

Since the inquiry effectively exonerated Scotland Yard, police across the country have launched a crackdown on the media.

Dozens of journalists have been 
arrested, as have police officers and other public servants accused of 
leaking information, even when no money changed hands.

'The contents of this intelligence report, if true, are disturbing'

Bob Quick, Scotland Yard's former head of counter-terrorism operations

Bob Quick, Scotland Yard's former head
of counter-terrorism operations, said he was 'surprised' the report was
not examined during the inquiry.

He told the Evening Standard: 'The contents of this intelligence report, if true, are disturbing.

'When it was discovered, it was 
swiftly and properly handed over to the Met prior to the Leveson 
hearings and I am surprised its content was not subject of some 
examination during the inquiry.'

A Met spokesman said: 'The 
intelligence report referred to dates from 2006. It did not identify an 
individual as the source of information allegedly being disclosed from 
the Met management board and it was not considered that it warranted 
further action.

'Intelligence reports may contain 
sensitive information and this document was therefore shared with the 
inquiry on a confidential basis.

'The Met will neither confirm nor deny
whether Public Interest Immunity was sought in relation to any material
provided to the inquiry. It was not for the Met to determine what was 
or was not put to any witnesses or used as evidence.'
