An unemployed husband accused of shooting his 34-year-old orthodontist wife to death in April and leaving their two-year-old daughter with the body has been allowed to live in the home where the brutal murder occurred.

A Williamson County judge ruled yesterday that Randolph Maidens, 42, from Brentwood, Tennessee, can return to the Governors Club family home he shared with his wife and daughter until April 21, when Dr Rachael Maidens was found dead.

A restraining order on money the couple jointly held is still in place and his passport has been revoked.

Murdered: Randolph Maidens allegedly killed his wife Rachael Maidens in their gated community home

Scene: He later emerged from trees at the back of their plush home in Brentwood, Tennessee

Court Hearing: Randolph Maidens appears in court in May during a preliminary hearing in his trial for murdering his wife, Dr Rachael Maidens

Dr Rachael Maidens' body was found wrapped in a blanket with multiple gunshot wounds on April 21 by police.

A note 'expressing regret for what happened' and asking for custody of the child to go to Dr Maiden's mother was on the kitchen 
counter, the shotgun by the couch and the car trunk stuffed with $87,200.

His young daughter told responding officers when they came to the home to perform a welfare check: 'Daddy gone.'

The two-year-old was not injured.

A manhunt was launched for the former pharmaceuticals representative and the community was put on lockdown but he walked into the home the next morning with his hands in the air and surrendered.

Rachael Maidens’ mother, Elizabeth 
Frisbie, brought a civil action against her former son-in-law that 
included time to conduct an inventory of the house’s contents, joint 
bank accounts and other personal property held by the couple.

Maidens has pleaded not guilty to all
charges, including homicide, a charge of child abuse/neglect for 
leaving his child alone while he fled and two counts of tampering with 
evidence.

Court Date: Randolph Maidens is charged with shooting his orthodontist wife dead on April 21st with a shotgun in their Tennessee home

Arrest: Maidens fled the home after allegedly killing his wife and leaving their daughter, 2, with her body

Together: Police have not revealed a motive and friends and neighbors said the family had seemed happy together

At the time of Rachael's death, one neighbor described how she witnessed Maidens acting bizarrely three weeks before the shooting.

'I saw him running through the woods behind our house, and he a had on a black ski 
mask and a backpack that looked like a quiver,' the neighbor told WKRN-TV.

'It was daytime 
and he was running through the woods... and down to the ravine, right past our house, and I followed him 
and he laid down in the ravine and pulled off the ski mask.'

When she asked him what he was doing, 'He made some 
kind of statement that made no sense' before adding, 'Well, I was walking my dogs, I got lost', she said.

Hunt: Police deployed helicopters and K-9 units to search for Maidens after the body of his wife was found but he surrendered the next day

Ripped apart: Maidens is out on bond and is free to live in the marital home he shared with his wife

Rachael Maidens owned an orthodontist practice, RM Orthodontics, in Maryland Farms.

'I think to say just how sorry I am and I'm going to miss coming to the office and seeing her,' former patient Cindy Bayer told News Channel 5. 'She always had a smile and was always friendly. She obviously enjoyed what she did, so it's a shame that her life's work is gone.'

Mrs Maidens, who grew up in Brentwood, met her husband while practicing in Atlanta for three years.

The couple's daughter has been placed with relatives.
