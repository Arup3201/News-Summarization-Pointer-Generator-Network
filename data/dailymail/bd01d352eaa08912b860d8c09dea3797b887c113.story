A man wanted over a stabbing at a holiday park absconded from an open prison last month, police have revealed.

Charlie Casey, 22, is believed to have stabbed a 24-year-old woman at Oakdene Forest Park in St Leonards, Dorset, at about 8pm on Wednesday.

The victim, from Wales, suffered a non-life-threatening injury and was taken to Poole Hospital.

Dorset Police said that Casey could be in the Binfield, Slough or Gwent areas and urged the public not to approach him.

He is described as white, 6ft 1in and of average build. He has short, dark brown hair and blue eyes and speaks with an Irish accent.

He absconded from HMP Sudbury in Derbyshire at the end of April, while serving a sentence of four years and eight months for robbery and false representation.

Detective Sergeant Andy Bell, from Bournemouth CID, said: ‘Officers are searching for Charlie Casey and we are following positive lines of inquiry.

‘We believe that he may have been in the Binfield and Slough area but has now moved on to Gwent.

‘If members of the public see anyone matching the description, or anyone hiding or acting in a suspicious or unusual way, then I would urge them to call their local police straight away.

‘I would like to appeal directly to Charlie to make contact with the authorities as soon as possible.’
