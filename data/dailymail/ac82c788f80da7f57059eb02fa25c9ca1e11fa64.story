Four Slovenian ski officials have been suspended for allegedly rigging the results of pop violinist Vanessa-Mae to help her qualify for the Winter Olympics in Russia.

Skiing for Thailand as Vanessa Vanakorn – her father’s name – she finished a distant last of the 67 racers in the two runs in the giant slalom in Sochi.

To earn enough points to be eligible for the Games, she had to compete in official races in Sweden, Norway, Slovenia and Switzerland.

The Slovenian Ski Association said it had found evidence races were ‘fixed at the behest of Thai ski officials to meet her qualifying criteria for Sochi’.

Its president, Jurij Zurej, said this included falsified times and rankings, which the 35-year-old violinist might not have known about at the time.

She clocked her two Olympic runs 50.1 seconds slower than gold medallist Tina Maze of Slovenia.
