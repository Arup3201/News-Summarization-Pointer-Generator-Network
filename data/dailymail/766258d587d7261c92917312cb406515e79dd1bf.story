With her soon-to-be-husband enduring grueling daily workouts for Strictly, it looks like Michelle is feeling the pressure to keep up.

Despite having one of the most lusted-after bodies in the business, the 27-year-old actress is obviously on a renewed fitness drive.

As well as being spotted leaving the gym regularly and working out with future sister in law Jessica Wright two days in a row, Michelle has been keeping fit at home and has signed up to a meal delivery service.

It is hard to believe it based on this selfie, but Michelle is on a renewed fitness drive

Michelle, currently filming for a new BBC drama 'Ordinary Lives' has shared pictures of her meals and juices from company, Soulmate Food which specialises in tailor-made diet and detox plans

Michelle recently shared this snap, caption 'At home workout!!!!  done 10mins n I'm already bored! Hahaha' with her over two million Instagram followers 

Michelle, currently filming for a new BBC drama 'Ordinary Lives' has shared pictures of her meals and juices from company, Soulmate Food which specialises in tailor-made diet and detox plans.

One shot she posted to her 1,266,684 Instgram followers showed a days meals including a breakfast of Spanish tortilla with patatas bravas.

In her blog for Hello! magazine she wrote: 'Despite the early starts I have managed to get my ass to the gym a few times so I'm feeling pleased about that, I try and do a mix of cardio and squats, lunges and press ups using weights for about 45 mins to an hour. 

'I still hate the thought of going but once I have been I feel so much better!'

She later boast that she has been three times this week. 

One of those times was with Mark's sister Jessica who posted an impressive picture of the pair on Instagram balancing on one leg on a PowerPlate machine, holding a ball up in the air.

The 29-year-old is about to return to our screens in a BBC drama, which may be motivating her fitness blitz

Michelle's new fitness kick may also be because fiancee Mark will be honing his body with his grueling Strictly workouts 

Jessica, who is currently trying to get over her ex Ricky Rayment, captioned the shot: 'Regram from today in the gym me & @michkeegangoing for it 2nd day in a row training with @danib_gd'.

Previously Michelle has been less bothered about her diet and fitness regime with Mark admitting she eats ice-cream in bed.

‘She doesn’t diet that much. She had a Magnum ice cream at 12 o’clock last night in bed! She just goes to the gym two to three times a week and watches what she eats,’ he told New magazine earlier this year.

However, whether it her latest undertaking in the BBC's gritty drama Ordinary Lies that has spurred her latest fitness kick or Mark becoming more chiseled due to his Strictly dance rehearsals, Michelle seems determined to shape up.  

She quit her role as Corrie barmaid Tina McIntyre earlier this year and was brutally killed off the ITV soap in her dramatic exit and this will be her first big return to our screens.
