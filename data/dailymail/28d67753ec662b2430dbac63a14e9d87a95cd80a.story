Liverpool are interested in Standard Liege starlet Thibaud Verlinden.

The 15-year-old midfielder is a highly regarded member of Belgium's U16 squad along with Adrien Bongiovanni who is being watched by Tottenham.

No deal has yet been agreed with Liverpool for Verlinden but the teenager, whose father Dany played in goal for Club Brugge, is keen on the move.

Verlinden fuelled the rumour himself by retweeting a tweet from a Belgian journalist about the move

Verlinden himself fuelled the rumours by retweeting a tweet from a Kristof Terreur, a Belgian journalist who claimed Liverpool were keen on a move.

Brendan Rodgers, speaking at a press conference on Tuesday, denied that Liverpool would be signing any players in the January window.

'It (buying new players) is not something I am looking at,' Rodgers explained. 'After the weekend, the focus was not to dwell on that. We have to learn from that and try and get a result here (against Ludogorets, who they played on Wednesday night).'
