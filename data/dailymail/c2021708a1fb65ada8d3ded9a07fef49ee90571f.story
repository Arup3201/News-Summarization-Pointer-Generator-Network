Two bottles of French champagne confiscated by the Nazis during World War Two and then 'liberated' by a British RAF member are to go under the hammer.

The bottles - a Chateau de Mareuilsay Montebello 1937 and a Monopole Red Top, by Heidsieck, from an unknown date - are both unopened and in good condition.

They were discovered by an RAF serviceman who was serving in France following D-Day in 1944, and who left them to his daughter. She then sold them to the unnamed vendor 10 years ago.

The two bottles of champagne were confiscated by the Nazis during the Second World War. Both are unopened and in good condition

The bottles have been stamped with identical red labels in German and French which read 'Wehrmachts - Marketenderware Verkauf in Freien Handel verboten' - Sales in the Free Market are Prohibited - and 'Reserve a la Wehrmacht, Achat et Revente interdits' - Reserved for German Army Not for Resale or Purchase.

Around 80 per cent of French champagne was seized by the occupying Germans following the invasion of 1940.

Auctioner Charles Hanson said while Adolf Hitler was teetotal, chief of the Luftwaffe Hermann Goering filled vast cellars with stolen bottles of champagne following the invasion of France.

He said: 'Following the German conquest of France, the Nazi high command consumed vast amounts of champagne to flaunt their victory.

'They even set up a permanent office at Reims to control the production of fizz, ensuring themselves a constant supply.

'It is remarkable that these two bottles of bubbly still exist, considering the unquenchable thirst the Nazi forces seemed to have for fine French Champagne.

'Although Adolf Hitler himself was teetotal, chief of the Luftwaffe Hermann Goering filled vast cellars with stolen bottles.

'And some of the last planes into besieged Stalingrad in 1942 to 1943 were carrying crates of vintage champagne to desperate military officers.'

The bottles are expected to fetch up to Â£150 each when they are sold in Etwell, Derbyshire, on June 20.
