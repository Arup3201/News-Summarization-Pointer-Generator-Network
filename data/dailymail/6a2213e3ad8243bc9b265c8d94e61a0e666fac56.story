Consumers might need to buy bigger and faster mobile price plans in order to feed data-hungry devices like Google Glass, according to experts.

American technology guru Brian Fung predicts wearable devices like Google Glass will be expensive for consumers as the hardware will probably not be subsidised by wireless carriers and users will have to upgrade their data plans.

It is believed the device will put a huge burden on internet infrastructure and force companies to increase capacity.

But it could also spark an increase in 
the cost of data plans - possibly for all consumers even if they are not
taking advantage of the new technology.

Google glass connects to the internet by
linking to the web via a mobile phone or tablet's data plan - otherwise
known as tethering - to create a mobile hotspot, The Washington Post reported.

Different networks have various rules and price plans for tethering, with many offering 'bolt-on' packages, such as Orange's £3 bolt-no for 30MB of data.

Some all-inclusive mobile contracts include tethering in the UK, such as Three's One Plan, while others offer the service in specific bundles.

Mr Fung believes that just as the way we used to pay for access to the internet changed about a decade ago, the introduction of wearable technology - with its huge demand for data - will shake up the current way tethering is used and paid for.

In the way that Wi-Fi made it possible to tether a number of computers to the same internet account, mobile phone providers will sell tetherable mobile broadband, he predicted.

However, no-one is sure how much mobile tethering goes on today.

If 10 per cent of Americans buy into 
Google Glass when it launches to the public, as they have hinted they 
might, tethering could be changed forever and go from a handy extra 
feature to an essential requirement in order to get Google Glass to work
as advertised, Mr Fung said.

It is thought that this tethering service could be a massive source of income for mobile companies in the future.

Gregory Rosston, a Stanford researcher and the former deputy chief economist of the FCC, told The Washington Post that if 35 million Americans did go out and buy Google Glass, it would put a huge strain on the country's mobile infrastructure.

He said that the iPhone was a game-changer as it forced mobile carriers to build more data capacity and pushed people to pay for the data they used.

'I think if Google Glass takes off, two similar things will happen,' he said.

Mr Fung believes it is hard to predict whether Google Glass will use up more data than an average smartphone.

However he calculates a five minute video clip recorded on the new device could need anywhere between  2.6 MB and 40.6 MB to download the clip to YouTube or stream the video depending on the quality of the film.

The way people use the device to tell 
stories and watch other people's content may differ from what we expect,
but their creative output will require an internet connection.

Mr Rosston told The Washington Post other wearable devices like Apple's watch could become the ultimate tethered device, but if a number of options take off at once, it could have a compound effect on a country's internet infrastructure.

One strategy could be to siphon mobile data traffic off to Wi-Fi.

One study suggests that 46 per cent of data will be shunted over to Wi-Fi instead of using 3G and 4G networks by 2017, but this percentage might have to increase if tethered devices like Google Glass take off.

He told the American newspaper: 'We don’t know if it’s Google Glass that’s going to be the one to take off, or Apple’s iGlass, if you’ll excuse the expression.

'But whatever it is . . . they either try to increase capacity or they try and take advantage of [the lack of supply] and raise prices. I think they’ll do both.'
