After entering a rehabilitation program almost six weeks ago on January 28, Cleveland Browns quarterback Johnny Manziel is still receiving treatment at the facility.

Manziel's NFL coach, Mike Pettine, confirmed on Monday that Manziel is still at the private rehab center in Ohio. 

There is no date set for the 22-year-old 2012 Heisman Trophy winner to be released.

Manziel played in five games in the NFL during his rookie season last year and only completed 51.4 per cent of his passes for 175 yards, two interceptions and no touchdowns

Manziel is staying  at the center, which possibly treats alcohol and substance abuse, longer than the minimum 28 days required by many treatment programs the Cleveland Plain Dealer reported. 

Pettine said 'football is an afterthought' right now for Manziel.

He added: 'We're just giving him his privacy and [letting him] do what he has to do.'

Pettine, who visited Manziel last month, was asked if it was a good sign the young quarterback extended his stay.

He responded:  'Sure. It's something that he was very resolute that needed to get done and again.

'I'll respect his privacy and leave it at that.'

Manziel's fondness for partying and off-the-field antics were well known while he was in college at Texas A&M

Brad Beckworth, a Manziel family adviser, confirmed in February Manziel was getting treatment.

He said: 'Johnny knows there are areas in which he needs to improve in order to be a better family member, friend and teammate and he thought the offseason was the right time to take this step.'

Coach Pettine said it was 'too soon' to know if Manziel will be ready for voluntary offseason workouts next month, ESPN reported. 

He added: 'Getting him right personally comes first, then the professional part comes second.

'That was really the message when we talked to him. 

'Listen, get yourself right, and the football will take care of itself.'

Manziel played parts of seven quarters in the NFL during his rookie season last year. 

He only completed 51.4 per cent of his passes for 175 yards, two interceptions and no touchdowns.

He has a four-year contract with the Browns worth about $8.25million and endorsement deals with Nike, McDonald's, MusclePharm, and Snickers
