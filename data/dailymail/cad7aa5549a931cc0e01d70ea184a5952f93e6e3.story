Witness Matty Thomas, speaking to the NY Daily News, said: 'There were four bodies in the air. There was a lady who got hit as [the car] went through the glass window. 

'Her body was in the display case and her legs were under the car. She was bleeding all from the side of her head. They had to saw her out of the car. It’s going to be in my mind for the rest of my life.'

Reports suggested that the driver rear-ended a silver SUV before turning around and driving the wrong way down the street.
