Cristiano Ronaldo and Lionel Messi made their peace at Old Trafford – but the fans that came out to see them will have left feeling short-changed.

The superstar pair gave each other an affectionate if slightly awkward embrace as they led their respective countries out for Tuesday's international friendly and shook hands again before kick-off as they tried to counter claims of a bitter rivalry between them.

But there was great disappointment among supporters who had paid up to £60-a-ticket that neither man re-appeared for the second half as the contest billed as grudge match petered out into a meaningless exhibition.

An unapologetic Argentina manager Gerardo Martino said afterwards: 'It was always our plan to take him (Messi) off at half-time,' while Portuguese boss Fernando Santos preferred to hail Ronaldo's brief return to the club he graced between 2003 and 2009.

'He is a legend here, one of many legends. I grew up watching Denis Law. The club itself is a legend.'

Only 41,000 turned up at the so-called Theatre of Dreams. Those who suspected the showdown between the world's best two players would turn out to be mere hype were proved right.

The two icons did their bit for 45 minutes and then left the stage without a backward glance.

Without them the match descended into an exhibition and the only surprise was that Portugal managed to score a half-decent goal to win the match in injury-time.

Two of the 11 substitutes used on a stop-start evening were heavily involved with Ricardo Quaresma's cross from the left met with a diving header by left-back Raphael Guerreiro.

Old Trafford wasn't packed to the rafters with the top tier shut off to reduce the stadium's capacity to around 45,000. In the end, they couldn't completely fill the remaining space anyway.

Even so, promoters World XI knew a global television audience would tune in to compare the two footballing icons of their generation and the only winners of FIFA's World Player of the Year since 2007.

It made for a terrific picture as the two famous men led their teams out side-by-side as rival captains.

Both men seemed keen to end any hostilities between them, caused by allegations that Ronaldo's associates refer to Messi as 'the dwarf'. They greeted each other in the tunnel, a friendly handshake accompanied by a mutual pat on the back and broad smile. Ronaldo even reached over to briefly put his arm round Messi as a peace offering.

The problem for Ronaldo is that while he is comparable to Messi in terms of talent and status, his Portugal side are grossly inferior to Argentina as a unit.

The World Cup finalists hardly broke sweat and should have had the match wrapped up in the first 25 minutes.

Angel di Maria, the £60million Premier League record signing and not a bad supporting player to Messi, curled a low shot narrowly wide before the little magician tried an audacious attempt from an acute angle and hit the base of the post. 

Messi and Ronaldo both lasted just 45 minutes at Old Trafford. Here are their stats and heat maps.

Javier Pastore then had a header saved at full-stretch by Beto before Messi curled a free-kick just over.

The only worry for Argentina – and watching United manager Louis van Gaal – came when Di Maria had his foot stamped on by Nani, ironically still one of his players albeit on loan at Sporting Lisbon. It was surprising that Di Maria was allowed to continue after finally getting to his feet and lasted an hour before he was replaced by Carlos Tevez.

Of course, any foothold Portugal gained in the game was exclusively down to Ronaldo. He brought Old Trafford to its feet by turning a couple of Argentine defenders inside-out before firing over.

Martin Demichelis of Manchester City was then booked for blatantly body-checking Ronaldo, naturally earning disapproval from the crowd.

In fact United fans seemed to be leaning towards supporting Portugal despite Di Maria's presence. That said a lot about the popularity of Ronaldo but also the four City players in Argentina's squad with Pablo Zabaleta, Sergio Aguero and Willy Caballero on the bench, as well as former Red and Blue Carlos Tevez.

Those street traders selling half-and-half Messi and Ronaldo scarves outside Old Trafford might not have been aware that both men have scored 29 hat-tricks each in their careers.

Messi led the personal head-to-head 12-7 in games played between them. But proof that this wasn't comparable in importance with El Clasico or the 2009 Champions League final came when neither Messi or Ronaldo re-emerged for the second half as both countries embarked on a number of changes.

Quaresma was the man who had to fill Ronaldo's boots while Nicolas Gaitan of Benfica had the unenviable task of being the 'new Messi'.

Predictably, the intensity and atmosphere dropped significantly with the two main protagonists departed.

Argentina were marginally the better team but the crowd voted with their feet, literally, by standing to do a Mexican wave for the last 15 minutes.

Despite the late winner, it was a damp squib of a friendly – but at least Ronaldo and Messi are friends.
