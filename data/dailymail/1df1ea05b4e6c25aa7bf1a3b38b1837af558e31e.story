These were the shocking scenes of devastation in northern Japan this morning after torrential rain sparked floods and a massive mudslide killing six people.

At least eight buildings were destroyed by one mudslide in Senboku, Akita prefecture, which was triggered when about four inches of rain fell in an hour yesterday - a local record.

The Japanese Meterological Agency has issued evacuation warnings to residents and it's understood that at least 300 people have been forced out of their homes.

Tragedy: Rescue workers including Japan Self-Defense Forces soldiers battle through wreckage to carry a resident who was found near a collapsed house 

Others have been wading through 
waterlogged streets in the town of Yahaba, in the Iwate prefecture as 
rivers over-spilled into the streets. 

Dozens of soldiers and police have 
since been combing the area near Lake Tazwa in Semboku, looking for dead
and survivors following the massive mudslide.

Pictures from the scene show the twisted wreckage of homes, tree branches and trunks buried underneath several feet of mud.

So far they have found the bodies of a 93-year-old man, his 88-year-old wife and their 61-year-old son near their home.

The son's wife is still believed to be missing, police said.

They have also recovered the body of a 58-year-old in the rubble and the body of a 62-year-old man was also discovered.

It is believed that he was swept away by an overflowing river.
