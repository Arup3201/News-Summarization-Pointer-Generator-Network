An engaged mother-of-three was shot dead by a man outside a bar after refusing to give him her phone number, her devastated family has told.

Mary Spears, 27, was killed by a gunshot wound to the head outside the American Legion Joe Louis Post No 375 on Detroit's east side in the early hours of Saturday morning.

Five other members of her family were wounded as the gunman sprayed the area with a hail of bullets.

Victim: Mary 'Unique' Spears, a 27-year-old mother of three, was shot dead outside a Detroit bar after refusing to give a man her phone number, distraught relatives have said

According to relatives Miss Spears, who was known to friends as Unique, had gone to the bar after attending a funeral when the 38-year-old suspect, who she did not know, began to harass her.

The relative, who did not wish to be named, told WJBK-TV: 'He said, "Can I get your name, your number," She said, "I have a man, I can't talk to you."'

But the man allegedly refused to take no for an answer and continued to harass Miss Spears who was the mother three sons, aged 1, 4 and 8.

The man was eventually thrown out of the bar by security at around 2am but began to harass Miss Spears outside after she left.
