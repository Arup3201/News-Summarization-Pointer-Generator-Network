A far-right political party from Greece, which openly admits to admiring Adolf Hitler but denies it draws inspiration from the Nazis, is planning to visit Australia.

The Golden Dawn Party, which has been criticised for its fascist beliefs and accused of violence towards immigrants, claims it already has thousands of Australian supporters and plans to raise money during trips to Sydney and Melbourne in October.

Australian spokesperson for the group, Ignatius Gavrilidis, has told the ABC that Golden Dawn party members Eleftherios Synadinos and Georgios Epitideios are hoping to 'raise money and gather support amongst young Australians'.

Golden Dawn have gained considerable support during the economic crises gripping the European Nation, gaining 9.4 per cent of the popular vote back in May, making them the third most prominent political party in Greece.

The leader of the party, Nikolass Michaloliakos, is currently in prison, awaiting trial on charges of murder, extortion, and involvement in the disappearance of up to 100 immigrants.

Mr Gavrilidis says there are about 70 campaigners in Australia, but thousands more followers. The party also has political allies, including Sydney based far-right party Australia First.

He denies Golden Dawn, which uses Nazi-inspired signs and logos to promote the party, is a modern incarnation of fascist WWII-era Germany, despite admitting some of its members support Adolf Hitler.

'Yes, they have admired the leadership of Hitler, just like we also admire the leadership of many strong leaders across the world,' he said.

The Golden Dawn members could face difficulties with the proposed trip. The group is considered a criminal organisation in Greece, and supporters of such groups can be denied entry into Australia.

Victorian Liberal MP Nick Kotsiras, a former minister in the State Government, told ABC: 'I would hope that these individuals are checked, their backgrounds are checked by the Department of Foreign Affairs, to make sure that if they don't fit into that criteria, they are not allowed to enter Australia.'

There is also a threat from local opposition. Several Golden Dawn supporters were assaulted at a protest they organised in Brisbane last year. It's likely the proposed October events could be met with similar hostility.
