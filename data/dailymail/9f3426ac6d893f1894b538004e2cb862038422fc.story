Images of lonely polar bears seemingly stranded on chunks of drifting ice have become one of the defining images of global warming.

Now scientists warn that a quarter of Canadian polar bears could be wiped out by the end of the century because of shrinking ice caps.

Warming temperatures could destroy one tenth of the bear’s habitat, affecting their ability to roam across huge expanses of ice to hunt for food.

Biologists from the University of Alberta believe that as summers get warmer in the Canadian Arctic Archipelago - islands off the North American continent and Greenland – more permanent ice cover will melt away every year.

This means that by 2100, each polar bear population in the Archipelago may have to endure between two and five months of the year without ice at sea, which would likely lead to starvation and hamper their ability to mate.

Projected global warming would adversely affect one tenth of their habitat, which is being damaged by man-made pollution, according to the study.

It found that sea ice across the Arctic is declining and altering the physical characteristics of marine ecosystems.

Carbon emissions from human activities must be cut to net zero between 2055 and 2070 to prevent temperatures rising more than 2°C above pre-industrial levels.

Other greenhouse gases, such as methane, nitrous oxide and hydrofluorocarbons (HFCs) must reach net zero by the end of the century

Emissions need to peak within a decade, with all greenhouse gas emissions halving by mid-century.

Delaying taking action until after 2020 will lead to higher costs and increased risks to our way of life.

Predatory animals are vulnerable to these changes in sea ice conditions because a smaller amount of sea ice lessens animals' opportunities to roam across expanses of ice and catch prey.

The study, published in Plos One, used sea ice projections from 2006 to 2100 to gain an insight into the conservation challenges for polar bears.

Biologist Stephen Hamilton from University of Alberta said: ‘We predict that nearly one-tenth of the world’s polar bear habitat, as much as one-quarter of their global population, may undergo significant habitat loss under business-as-usual climate projections.’

Last week, UN scientists warned that carbon emissions must be cut to zero by at least 2064 if the planet is to avoid the effects of climate change becoming out of control.

They said that emissions from human activities, such as burning fossil fuels, should hit net zero between 2055 and 2070 to prevent temperatures rising more than 2°C above pre-industrial levels.

The stark report, by the UN Environment Programme (UNEP) said that emissions need to peak within a decade, with all greenhouse gas emissions halving by mid-century, in order to avoid sea levels rising and dramatic weather conditions, such as widespread droughts.

Countries have already agreed to limit temperature rises to no more than 2°C - beyond which dangerous impacts of climate change are expected - but UNEP said that if the world carries on as it is, greenhouse gas emissions will be ‘way beyond safe limits’.

Another study has revealed that the population of endangered African penguins fell by 70 per cent between 2001 and 2013 and is continuing to decline.

There are less than 18,000 breeding pairs left in the wild in South Africa.

Every year, experts from Bristol Zoological Society rescue chicks abandoned by their parents foraging for food, but this year they say the chicks are coming in early ‘in their hundreds’.

The crisis is not a direct result of global warming, but due to falling fish stocks.

The rehabilitation centre in South Africa is already helping to care for 430 and the numbers are growing at a previously unseen rate.

Because if the soaring price of fish, the Society has launched an appeal to feed and care for the chicks. 

Dr Christoph Schwitzer, Director of Conservation at Bristol Zoological Society said: ‘Unless conservation organisations intervene, these chicks will starve to death.

‘As African penguin populations are currently facing a crisis due to a diminished food supply near their nesting colonies, there is a substantial risk that this species could eventually become extinct without action.’

Chicks are abandoned at this time of year just before their parents start their moulting cycle, when they develop a new set of waterproof feathers.

Adult African penguins still need to make foraging trips during this time and leave their chicks behind.

Due to an increasing decline in fish stocks, penguins have to journey further afield for their food but are unable to swim before their moulting cycle.

This means that they cannot feed their chicks that are not old enough to fend for themselves, resulting in abandonment and starvation.
