Mark Slater has been convicted of murder after driving his lorry over the head of a grandfather following a road-rage row in February

A lorry driver was today jailed for life for murdering a grandfather-of-four by deliberately driving his 17-ton lorry over him following a petty row.

Mark Slater drove the lorry over the head of Trevor Allen, 56, after Mr Allen stood in front of the vehicle when the pair clashed on the A57 near Warrington in February.

The 46-year-old was convicted of murder after a jury at Chester Crown Court was shown 'dash-cam' footage of a road-rage attack carried out just months earlier by Slater, who the court heard was a 'coward' but became a 'big man' and a 'bully' behind the wheel of his truck.

Sentencing Slater to minimum 15 years today, Judge Mr Justice Robert Jay said: 'You drove forward knowing full-well he was still out of the vehicle.

'As you were driving forward he waved his arms in front of him or upwards for you to stop but you did not or even after it occurred, driving forward some distance.

'You said if he was in front of you, you would have seen him. Well he was and you did see him.

'Although the intention was formed suddenly, the fact remains you were behind the wheel of a 17-ton vehicle which was familiar to you. Once the red mist descended all reason and restraint was lost.' 

The sentencing came after damning evidence showed the lorry driver from Oldham laughing and jumping up and down as he punched and kicked the car of another motorist in a previous incident.

Two months after that, Slater and Mr Allen became involved in a row while both driving along the A57 on the outskirts of Warrington, Cheshire around 8am on February 15 this year.

Both drivers had come to a halt on the single carriageway road with Mr Allen getting out of his van and standing in front of the lorry with his arms outstretched.

It would have been 'obvious' to Slater that Mr Allen, a 'well-nourished' man of 16 stones and wearing a high-viz jacket, was in front of him, the court heard.

Forensic examination showed the victim was dragged underneath the vehicle with his head in the area of the front driver’s-side wheel. A roadside witness shouted at Slater: 'You’ve f****** killed him!'

After running over his victim, Slater stopped a short distance up the road and spoke to Simon Feltham, who stopped his own car to dial 999.

Slater claimed Mr Allen had been 'throwing things' at his lorry and it 'all started down at the lights,' the court heard. 

Trevor Allen's family believe he may have been killed by Slater after trying to stop the truck driver from talking on his mobile phone while driving along the A57 near Warrington, Cheshire

Slater said they were involved in an 'over-taking session' and claimed Mr Allen had thrown coins at the window of his cab.

The court heard that as Mr Allen lay dead in the road, Slater calmly told a 999 operator : "Hiya love - there's a man seriously injured'.

The taco-graph tracking the lorry’s movements before the fatal incident showed Slater pulling emergency brakes and 'flooring' the vehicle to its maximum 54mph - exceeding the road’s 40mph limit.

After Mr Allen’s death, his family said: 'Trevor was an amazing, caring dad, granddad, brother, uncle, son and friend to many.

'His smile and charm made the room light up when he walked in. Loved by all who knew him, he is irreplaceable and will be very sadly missed.'

The jury heard of two earlier road rage incidents, one caught on camera, involving other motorists and the defendant, before Mr Allen was killed.

One motorist described Slater as like a 'raging bull' threatening, 'I will f****** kill you!' after an incident on the M62 in January last year, while another, Jordan Ogden, 24, who recorded the incident on his 'dash cam' described the defendant as 'animal like' and a 'predator'. 

Footage from a dashboard camera showed 'animal' Slater kicking a car in a previous incident of road rage

Mr Ogden told the jury an 'angry' Slater, 'looked like he wanted me dead', during the incident on December 17 last year in Oldham.

The footage showed Slater getting out of his lorry cab on two occasions, running at the Corsa and kicking and punching the vehicle while trying to get the driver’s door open.

Mr Ogden told the jury: 'I don’t know how someone can react so violently to a situation. It would be like an animal hunt. It looked like he wanted me and he wanted me dead.'

After viewing the footage, Ian Unsworth QC, prosecuting, put it to Slater in the witness box: 'I’m suggesting what we saw there is you losing it with another road user, you have lost your temper and you have got a very short temper, a short fuse?

'And like the coward that you are, a big man behind the wheel and you become a bully in that lorry and that’s precisely what you were doing on that morning on the A57?'

Slater tried to claim he hadn't seen Mr Allen in the road but the jury convicted him of murder

The defendant responded: 'No.'

Slater told the jury while he accepted he drove over Mr Allen and caused his death, he said he simply did not see the victim standing in front of his vehicle. 

But he was convicted by the jury following three and a half hour deliberations at the end of a week long trial.

Slater made no reaction when he was found guilty. He was remanded into custody and now faces an automatic life sentence.

Many members of Mr Allen's large family burst into tears in the public gallery as the guilty verdict was delivered.

Widower Mr Allen, a father-of-three and grandfather of four was himself one of 13 children originally from the Middleton area of Manchester.

Outside court his eldest sister Muriel Farrell, 62, from Middleton said of her brother’s killer: 'I hope he rots in hell, I really do. We were all praying today for that murder verdict.

'It has been horrendous listening to it in court. It’s been terrible for the family, a lot can’t come to court because of it all.

'He was a lovely dad, a lovely brother, never caused any trouble, never been in trouble. He was actually a truck driver himself and he taught people himself how to drive HGVs.'

Mrs Farrell said her family believed her brother may have spotted Slater using his phone while driving shortly before the incident, which the defendant admitted.

Mr Allen’s family believe that, as a lorry driving instructor, he may have indicated to Slater to get off the phone - sparking the fatal confrontation.

In a statement, released after the verdict, Mr Allen’s daughter, Sarah Allen said: 'After a very distressing and emotional trial, justice has finally been done for my dad.

'I am very pleased that such a dangerous man has been convicted and is no longer a danger to other people.

'I wouldn’t wish this to happen to another family because it’s destroyed ours more than anyone could ever imagine.'
