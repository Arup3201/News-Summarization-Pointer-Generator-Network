Nestle is voluntarily recalling two of its Hot Pockets products as part of a larger meat recall.

The food maker said on Tuesday that it is recalling an unspecified number 
of 'Philly Steak' and its 'Croissant Crust Philly Steak and Cheese' Hot 
Pockets in certain sizes.

Nestle says the products may have been affected by a meat recall by Rancho Feeding Corp. that was announced last week.

Do you have this type of Hot Pocket in your freezer? Nestle announced that all customers with the Philly cheese steak meal should return it

'The reason is due to the recall announced last week by Rancho Feeding Corporation which affects many companies,' Nestle said in an announcement on its website, reports The Bangor Daily News.

Rancho is recalling more than 8.7 million pounds of beef products after 
regulators said that it processed diseased and unhealthy animals without
 a full inspection. The USDA says the products were unfit for human 
consumption.

No illnesses have been reported.

Nestle says a small quantity of meat from Rancho was used at a California production facility that makes Hot Pockets.

If you have any of the recalled Hot Pockets, Nestle warns customers not to consume them but to return them to the store for a full refund.

Those with the Hot Pockets can call the company customer service line at 800-392-4057.

Philly cheese steak with a croissant crust was also recalled because it might contain 'diseased' animals
