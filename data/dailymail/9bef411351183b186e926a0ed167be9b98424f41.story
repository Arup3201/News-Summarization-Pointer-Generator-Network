Birmingham City manager Gary Rowett is braced for bid from Premier League clubs for teen talent Demarai Gray once the January transfer window opens – but insists there is no financial pressure to sell.

Gray, 18, announced himself in the Championship with a hat-trick against Reading last Saturday and is in talks with his club over a new two-year deal. His current contract has 18 months to run.

Rowett believes Birmingham is the best place for the winger’s development, with Liverpool, Tottenham and Crystal Palace monitoring his situation. Palace had a £500,000 bid for Gray rejected in the summer and the Blues manager says it would take a large offer to force even consideration.

‘He’s as good as any young player I’ve seen at this age,’ said Rowett. ‘At 18 years old, the ability to score a hat-trick at Championship level doesn’t happen very often. He’s an exciting player. He gets the fans off the edge of their seats.

‘I’m realistic, I would expect some interest in January and I would expect that interest to be very strong from top clubs, because he is a top player.

‘But also you have to look at that he’s playing regular football in the Championship. Sometimes for a young player it’s just as important to get 100 starts than go to a bigger club and sit on the bench or play in Under 21 squads.

‘What he’s shown is we shouldn’t be looking to sell him for a low fee just to fit his ambitions. The club has a real potential star player on its hands.

‘We obviously have to manage him, manage his expectations, manage what he does on the pitch because he’s got a lot to learn still. I would expect if someone does want to buy him he’s not going to come. There are not many young British players around who can go past people, are quick, and can score goals.’
