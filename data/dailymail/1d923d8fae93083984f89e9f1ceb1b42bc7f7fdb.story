The hunt for one of the world's most wanted terrorism suspects known as 'The White Widow' has gone cold after it emerged she has undergone plastic surgery to evade capture.

Kenyan detectives admitted yesterday they were struggling to find fugitive Samantha Lewthwaite - but revealed she faces life imprisonment in the country when eventually caught.

The 30-year-old Muslim convert from Aylesbury in Buckinghamshire has spent the past two and a half years on the run and has been repeatedly linked to terrorist plots in East Africa.

The 'White Widow': Samantha Lewthwaite has spent the past two and a half years on the run

The mother-of-four - who is the widow of one of the 7/7 suicide bombers - is charged with plotting a bombing campaign across Kenya at Christmas in 2011.

The Kenyan investigation team chasing Lewthwaite were summoned to a court in Mombasa yesterday to explain why she had not been caught since Interpol issued an international Red Notice arrest warrant on September 25 last year.

In a statement, Police chief inspector Abednego Kilonzo said she had constantly changed her appearance, name and location while on the run.

In answer to a question in court, he confirmed they believed she had undergone plastic surgery. He said: 'She keeps on changing her face all the time.

He added: 'She is a person with multiple identification. She keeps on moving from one place to the other. She makes many faces and that is why it is difficult to arrest her.'

Mr Kilonzo also produced the Red Notice, which showed that Lewthwaite was faced extradition to Kenya from whichever country she was arrested in.

The notice read: 'If found guilty of the offence, the maximum penalty possible of the offence is life imprisonment.'

Lewthwaite, who converted to Islam at the age of 17, has been identified as a main recruiter for Al Qaeda in East Africa and is an official spokesman for terror group Al Shabaab.

The group admitted to a string of attacks in Kenya including last September's assault on Nairobi's Westgate shopping mall last year that claimed at least 67 lives.

She is wanted in Kenya on charges of being in possession of explosives and conspiracy to commit a felony dating back to December 2011.

After giving Kenyan police the slip in Mombasa in 2011, she has been on the run ever since, reportedly using a false South African passport and alias.

Lewthwaite is the widow of Jermaine Lindsay, one of four Islamist suicide bombers who blew himself up along with 26 passengers on a Tube train near King's Cross Station in London in 2005.

Following the tragedy, she portrayed herself as another victim of the tragedy and called it 'abhorrent'.

Kenyan Police have previously revealed Lewthwaite, also financed Woolwich murderer Michael Adebolajo's trip to East Africa for terror training.

She has even written poetry praising Osama bin Laden, according to computer files seized by police from her previous home in Mombasa.
