Roy Keane is set to be named Celtic manager after a flurry of bets were placed on the Irish assistant manager taking over at Parkhead as successor to Neil Lennon.

The odds on Keane being appointed as the next Celtic supremo were dramatically slashed from 33/1 to even money – one firm, BetVictor, went to 8/11.

While betting indicators are not always reliable, Sportsmail understands that Keane is on the brink of being appointed by the Parkhead hierarchy.

Green light: Ireland manager Martin O'Neill said he will not stand in the way if his right-hand man Keane wants to move to Parkhead

Though Malky Mackay, Owen Coyle, Oscar Garcia and Henrik Larsson have also been considered, Keane has won the race.

Martin O’Neill has predicted Keane will return to frontline club management and had stated he would not stand in his way should his right-hand man express a desire to move on – even if the club involved is one O’Neill used to manage.

Now that has happened, O’Neill has Steve Walford and Steve Guppy ready-in-waiting to provide coaching back-up with Ireland.

Keane is due to speak to the media at the Aviva Stadium on Thursday ahead of Saturday’s friendly against Italy in Craven Cottage. It’s likely one item will dominate the agenda.

Old Bhoy: Keane played half a season with Celtic after leaving Manchester United in the 2005-2006 campaign

Earlier this week, Keane spoke of his admiration for Celtic, for whom he played half a season at the end of his career, but declined to push himself forward as a candidate.

‘They are a brilliant club, an absolutely fantastic football club, one of the best in the world. But I have got a job,’ he said.

Since becoming Irish assistant manager, Keane has been linked with jobs at Sheffield Wednesday, Nottingham Forest, as an assistant to Louis Van Gaal at Manchester United, and now Celtic.

Shortlist: Owen Coyle, last in employment at Wigan, was also considered by Celtic

His profile has also risen with his ITV work where his presence guarantees high ratings.

Celtic are desperate to hire a 'box office' manager who can fill Celtic Park and pick up where Lennon left off.

Celtic’s major shareholder, Dermot Desmond, is a close friend of O’Neill and has direct access to discussing Keane’s suitability for the Celtic job, if required.

The FAI refused to comment on the rising speculation.
