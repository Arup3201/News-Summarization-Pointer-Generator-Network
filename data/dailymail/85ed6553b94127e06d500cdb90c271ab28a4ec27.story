Just as it looked the gay marriage would come to pass in Alabama, the state's chief justice has intervened to try and keep the state's unconstitutional same-sex marriage ban in place.

Chief Justice Roy Moore sent a letter Sunday evening that ordered probate judges to turn away same-sex couples seeking marriage licenses.

'Effective immediately, no probate judge of the state of Alabama nor any agent or employee of any Alabama probate judge shall issue or recognize a marriage license that is inconsistent with (the Alabama Constitution),' Moore wrote.

One couple had already set up camp in front of Montgomery's courthouse in order to be the first to get a license Monday morning.

'It's about time,' said Shante Wolfe, 21, who hugged her partner Tori Sisson in the tent they'd pitched.

Moore, an elected official who has written that he believes the 'Judeo-Christian God (is) the sovereign source of our law,' also once called homosexuality an 'evil' in a 2002 custody ruling.

Still, Susan Watson, executive director the American Civil Liberties Union of Alabama, said Moore was 'grandstanding' and would not likely delay same-sex marriage.

'We will see marriage equality in Alabama tomorrow. I don't think the probate judges in Alabama are going to defy a federal court judge's order,' Watson said Sunday.

The ACLU has set up a phone line for couples to call if they've been denied a license and Watson said the organization would visit courthouses through the state.

'I think it will really pretty simple. Hopefully we will be able to hand out a lot of wedding favors,' Watson said. 

The state's ban on gay marriage was ruled unconstitutional last month by US District Judge Callie Granade who later ordered the state's probate judges to issue licenses out of legal duty to the US Constitution. 

Some probate judges disclosed they would deny licenses until the courts further clarify the implications of Granade's ruling. 

It's unclear what grounds Chief Justice Moore will have to enforce his directive, which also threatened that Governor Robert Bentley could punish elected officials who fail to follow the law.

A spokeswoman for Bentley said she was unaware of Moore's letter and did not comment on it.

At least some of the state's judges have said they were expecting to follow through with Judge Granade's ruling.

'With all due respect to Chief Justice Moore, he’s on the Alabama Supreme Court, and he’s not a federal judge,' Jefferson County Probate Judge Alan L King said last week, reported the New York Times.
