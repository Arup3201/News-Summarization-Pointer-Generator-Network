Mr Wagner has been producing art work since he was just a child. He
said: 'At 12 I started to draw and a year later I discovered graffiti, I
started with nightly, illegal lettering in urban areas and improved my 
graffiti skills to large scale commissions.

'I
bought a camera for my work and my friends to be documented as a 
graffiti artist. I quickly realised what great potential the photography
had and I started to use it as an independent artistic medium to use.

'At
16 I was then beginning to realise that I wanted to be a photographer. 
During a long period of experimenting I found that with long exposure at
night, things you can not see with the naked eye. could be visualised. 
That fascinated me and I started my 'Nightscapes' series.
