A married Manhattan anti-aging doctor has been accused of sharing naked pictures of patients and trading Botox for sex.

Former Cenegenics employee AnnMarie Miglorino says Dr. George Shapiro, 53, often bragged about ‘Botox for b**w j***s’ and made unwanted sexual advances towards her last year in a harassment complaint filed with the Equal Employment Opportunity Commission.

Miglorino, 32, says the father of five even showed her a picture of a woman ejaculating and asked ‘if I could do that,’ the New York Daily News reported, citing the complaint.

‘They were allegedly for his medical journal, but they were in the camera roll on his cell phone,’ she told the paper.

Miglorino objected to being shown the filth and ‘he’d laugh and try to make a joke out of if it,’ she added.

The supposed pervert is also accused by Miglorino of showing her texts from women he had sex with and asking if she wanted to join them for threesomes, as well as making ‘creepy comments’ about how she looked in yoga pants.

Shapiro made ‘repeated, frequent comments to me about what he thought about my anatomy (mostly my rear end and how he likes the way it looks in the yoga tights I was required to wear to work),’ she said in the complaint, according to the paper.

He ‘tried to kiss me on the mouth several times, and hugged me inappropriately a few times in a sexual manner, pushing his hips into me,’ the complaint reportedly continues.

Fired: Miglorino claims she was fired for spurning his multiple attempts to have sex with her

The final straw was last August when Shapiro cornered her in the Cenegenics office on Wall Street and said he wanted to ‘put her on the window sill’ and perform oral sex on her, Miglorino told the paper.

‘I immediately left the office and complained,’ she recalled. A manager soon became involved and went to Shapiro, but he responded angrily.

‘You have a big mouth,’ he snarled at her, according to the complaint.

Shapiro is head of the national chain’s New York office.

She soon became an outcast and by December was out of a job, fired without cause, she insists.

‘I’ve never not had a job before,’ she lamented to the paper.

Miglorino’s complaint is the first step towards filing a federal sexual harassment lawsuit against both Shapiro and Cenegenics.

She is looking to be ‘compensated for the loss of work, stress and anxiety, and so that they learn their lesson from this,’ she explained.

This is not  the veteran doctor's first brush with trouble.

He pleaded guilty in 2006 to giving out unauthorized samples of Cialis, Viagra and other drugs, records showed. He received a year of probation and a $500 fine but was allowed to continue practicing medicine.

Multiple messages left seeking comment from Shapiro were not returned.
