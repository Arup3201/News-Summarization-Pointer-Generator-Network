They have become the rallying cry for Ferguson protesters across the world.

But the words, 'Hands up, don't shoot!', may never actually have  been said by Michael Brown, according to witness accounts contained in thousands of grand jury documents.

Similarly, the unarmed black 18-year-old's hands might not have been raised in the air when he was shot dead by white officer Darren Wilson in the St Louis, Missouri, suburb on August 9.

The accounts, released by prosecutors earlier this week and reviewed by the Associated Press, feature a number of variations as to the position of Brown's hands at the time of the fatal shooting.

Rallying cry: They have become the rallying cry for protesters across the world. But the words, 'Hands up, don't shoot!', may never actually have been said by Michael Brown, according to newly-seen witness accounts

While some witnesses claim he knelt on the ground, raised his hands and shouted, 'Don't shoot!', before he was gunned down by Wilson, others insist he was stood up with his arms by his sides.

For those who believe his hands were raised, some think they were pointed toward the sky, others claim were partially raised and several believe his palms appeared out, as if he was surrendering.

And to a number, Brown's palms seemed open, as if he was glancing at his wounded hand or gesturing with an attitude of 'What are you going to do about it?'

The contradictory accounts arguably undermine the  'Hands up, don't shoot!' cry, now a national symbol of racial inequality for those who believe overzealous police target minorities too often.

However, some argue it does not matter whether Brown's hands were literally raised in the air - nor whether he yelled, 'Hands up, don't shoot!' - because his death symbolizes a bigger movement. 

'This is not about one boy getting shot in the street, but about the hundreds just like him who have received the same callous and racially-influenced treatment,' protester, Gabe Johnson, a middle school teacher from Oakland, California, said.

'So ultimately, no, it doesn’t matter at all if somehow we can say for sure whether this one young man really said these words or had his hands up.'

Demonstrator James Cox, 28, a food server, also from Oakland, added: 'He wasn't shot because of the placement of his hands; he was shot because he was a big, black, scary man.' 

Following the announcement of the grand jury's decision not to indict Wilson in the case on Monday, protesters have been taking to the streets of more than 170 U.S. cities in demonstration.

1. Michael Brown knelt on the ground, raised his hands and shouted, 'Don't shoot!', before he was gunned down by Darren Wilson.

2. The unarmed 18-year-old's hands were pointed toward the sky

3. His hands were only partially raised

4. Brown's palms appeared out, as if he was surrendering to Wilson

5. His palms seemed open, as if he was glancing at his wounded hand or gesturing with an attitude of 'What are you going to do about it?'

6. Brown was stood up with his arms by his sides - not raised - when he was shot dead 

Every night so far, thousands of people - from Los Angeles to New York to London - have raised their arms in the air and chanted: 'Hands up, don't shoot!' 

Some have carried hand-made banners featuring the same words, others have held posters reading: 'Black lives matter' and hundreds have accused the police of 'brutality'.

The shooting has had particular resonance in London, which was rocked by days of rioting after the 2011 death of Mark Duggan, a young black man shot dead by police under disputed circumstances.

Meanwhile, in Ferguson, some protesters have even been donning shirts printed with the phrase, 'Hands up, don't shoot!', as they demonstrate outside the suburb's police station.

The truth behind the words may never be certain. Despite a state investigation and an ongoing federal probe, no one has publicly disclosed any photos or videos of exactly what transpired.

Protester Taylor Gruenloh, a 32-year-old white man from nearby Florissant, said that while he believes there is truth to the claims that Brown had his hands raised when shot, the lack of proof makes little difference to demonstrators who have found it to be a unifying force.

'Even if you don't find that it's true, it's a valid rallying cry,' he said. 'It's just a metaphor.'

Meanwhile, architect Evan Chakroff, who was this week protesting in Seattle, claimed the 'Hands up' gesture is far from a literal representation of the circumstances of Brown's death.

Weapon: This gun, used to kill Brown, was also released as part of the dump of grand jury evidence

'My sense is that it's totally symbolic and a way of representing powerlessness' in the face of inequality and militarized police, he said.

Brown had been walking with a friend down the center of Canfield Drive on August 9 when Wilson, passing in his patrol vehicle, told them to move to the sidewalk.

After they refused to do so, Wilson reportedly realized Brown was a robbery suspect, at which point a scuffle broke out at the window of his vehicle.

In subsequent seconds, Wilson fired a shot that hit Brown in the right hand. When the teenager ran, Wilson gave chase. At some point, Brown stopped and turned toward Wilson, who opened fire.

Wilson told the grand jury that Brown had his left hand in a fist at his side and his right hand under his shirt at his waist, and was charging toward him, when he gunned him down.

Some of the witness accounts of the high-profile shooting differed so much that they did not seem like the same scene. Above, protesters lie outside a Ferguson mall on Saturday in protest at the grand jury's verdict

In the grand jury documents, the phrase 'hands up' is peppered as prosecutors and investigators desperately tried to clarify exactly what witnesses saw.

In quite a few cases, it is unclear precisely what onlookers say they saw because the gestures they made for grand jurors were not described in the transcripts.

Alarmingly, some of the witness accounts of the high-profile shooting differed so much that they did not seem like the same scene.

'I saw him in the middle of the street on his knees with hands up,' one witness said. '[The] officer came up to him and shot him in his head and he fell.'

But another witness was insistent that Brown was on his feet at the time and did not raise his hands.

'The officer was already in pursuit of him,' they said. 'He stopped. He did turn, he did some sort of body gesture, I'm not sure what it was, but I know it was a body gesture.

'And I could say for sure he never put his hands up after he did his body gesture, he ran towards the officer full charge.'

According to experts, the disputed circumstances of Brown's death highlight the inherent troubles with the use of eyewitness testimony in court.

'It's difficult for people under the best of circumstances to accurately report what happened,' said Elizabeth Brondolo, a psychology professor specializing in race at St. John's University in New York.

For Wilson and others at the shooting scene, what they say they saw may depend not just on their vantage point, but also their view of life, she said.

'The truth always really matters, but it's important to recognize that past experience to stereotypes also influences the perception of hands being raised,' she said.
