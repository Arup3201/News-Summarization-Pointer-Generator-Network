A new video has emerged showing Las Vegas gunman Jerad Miller in the midst of a conspiracy-theorist rant while imitating the Joker from the hit film The Dark Knight.

'I want to be President. I want to be the warmonger, not just some terrorist. Not just some everyday terrorist, domestic terrorist,' he raves in the 2012 video footage obtained by Inside Edition.

'I want to blow up whole countries, whole nations. I want to make everyone submit to one world order governance, under my rule!'

Killers: Jerad and Amanda Miller have been identified as the couple who killed three in Las Vegas on Sunday

Miller is made up in full costume - a practice that was something of a past time for him and his wife - while he delivers a monologue apparently meant to mock President Barack Obama, who he believed was setting up concentration camps and planning to take away American citizens' guns.

Miller, 31, and his wife Amanda, 22, ambushed and killed two Las Vegas police officers on Sunday before fleeing to a Walmart, where they shot dead a civilian who pulled a gun on them.

Amanda Miller then shot her husband in the head before committing suicide as SWAT officers closed in.

Jerad Miller, an avowed white supremacist and neo-Nazi, is said to have shouted 'The revolution is coming!' during the rampage. He also draped one of the dead officers with a swastika.

It is believed that Miller was motivated by a raft of conspiracy theories about the 'New World Order' - including the belief that a United Nations-controlled government was planning to round up citizens and take away their weapons and ship them to concentration camps.

Villains: The couple regularly dressed as Batman villains The Joker and Harley Quinn, neighbors said

These are all on full display in the Inside Edition video.

'Vote for me, America. Utter transparency. You will know what you get with me, and I'm telling you - it's what you want.'

Inside Edition will detail the entire report Tuesday and Wednesday.
