The schizophrenic patient of a Manhattan psychologist muttered that he didn’t mean to kill her with a meat cleaver and only wanted money to help out his ailing mother.

David Tarloff, who is on trial in New York for the 2008 slaughtering of Dr Kathryn Faughey, 56, confessed to NYPD officers that he only meant to ‘tie her up and scare her’ in a video that was shown to the jury on Wednesday.

During the ten-minute interrogation, the accused murderer also asked for the cops to bring him a sandwich, changing his mind several times between salami, pastrami, and corned beef. Throughout the interview, Tarloff, 44, has to be roused by the officers.

His lawyers do not dispute the horrific February 16, 2008 crime, but are using the insanity defence, saying that because of his mental health.

At one point in the video, Tarloff can be seen swaying his head and mumbling. An officer asks him if he would like a sandwich.

‘David? David?’ The detective prompts, finally getting Tarloff to say that he wanted ‘pastrami or salami. Actually I’ll have pastrami please, or corned beef,’ according to the New York Daily News.

In a haunting moment of the interrogation, Tarloff confessed: ‘I didn’t want to kill them. All I wanted was money,’ he said, saying that his mother was forced to live in squalor at her nursing home.

‘She had been sitting in feces for five years,’ he muttered to the two detectives.

Tarloff then recounted to the detectives how he first called Dr Faughey’s Upper East Side office to make sure she and Dr Kent Shinbach, with whom she shared a space, were there. He talked of plans to tie up Dr Shinbach and take the $50,000 and run.

His confession was peppered with apologies.

‘I’m sorry. I only wanted money to go away,’ he said, according to the New York Post. He slashed the psychologist 15 times with a nine-inch meat cleaver.

Prosecutors and Faughey's family say Tarloff carried out a considered, criminal plan.

Tarloff admitted he wanted to rob Faughey's colleague with whom she shared an office to get money to take his sick mother to Hawaii, and was deemed mentally unfit for court months later. After doctors said his condition had improved, jury selection got started in 2010 but he was again declared unfit.

Authorities say that Tarloff set out with a bag full of knives
to hold up his psychiatrist for 
$50,000, grab his mother out of a nursing home, and escape with her to 
Hawaii.

The trial's jury will be asked to decide whether 
Tarloff, who has a decades-long history of hospitalizations and 
hallucinations about God and Satan speaking to him, knew he was doing 
wrong when he killed Dr Faughey.

They had never met. He had said he was frightened that she was going to attack him because her long fingernails alarmed him.

'Believe me, I wish she was never there - but I thought she was evil,' 
Tarloff told a psychologist in 2010. 'I went to kill her. I thought I 
had no choice.'

'Everything about his thought process was so bizarre - so crazy - that 
the proof in the case shows he was legally insane,' lawyer Bryan Konoski
has said.

However prosecutors and Faughey's family feel that, whatever Tarloff's 
illness, his actions bespoke a considered, violent scheme.

'He planned this out' and was heavily armed, said Owen Faughey, one of 
her brothers. 'He was determined, it would seem, to stop anyone who 
would interfere with his plan. And, unfortunately, that's where our 
sister fell victim to his plan. He should be held fully accountable.'

It was an accident that Tarloff and Faughey, a 56-year-old therapist who
specialized in helping people with relationships, met at all. Faughey 
shared an office with psychiatrist Dr Kent Shinbach, who treated 
Tarloff in 1991 but hadn't seen him since.

Yet in February 2008, as an increasingly panicky Tarloff tried to craft 
what he saw as a rescue plan for his mother, he thought of Shinbach. He 
figured the psychiatrist had money, and he'd get it from an ATM after 
forcing the doctor to disclose his code, Tarloff later told police and 
psychologists.

'I figured a little bump on the head. No one would know, and I would have $40,000,' Tarloff said.

He went to Shinbach's office one evening with a rubber mallet, a set of 
kitchen knives, rope, duct tape, a suitcase full of adult diapers and 
clothing for his mother — and a belief that the plan had God's blessing,
he told a psychologist.

He encountered Faughey instead and hacked her 15 times, then seriously wounded Shinbach when he tried to save her.

Tarloff, now 44, was a college student when his mind abruptly began 
fracturing into paranoid suspicions of classmates and a preoccupation 
with God and the devil.

Over the years, as he was hospitalized more than a dozen times, he 
recounted seeing 'Satan' spelled out in his mind and the 'eye of God' on
the kitchen floor, according to psychologists' reports and court 
papers. He heard police sirens and concluded they'd been summoned by his
bad thoughts.

He viewed pieces of paper on the street as a special 
message from God. His relatives begged him to stay in mental hospitals or adult homes, but he left them, psychologists said.

After his mother, Beatrice, moved from the Queens apartment they shared 
into a nursing home in 2004, Tarloff grew still more erratic and 
fixated. Convinced she wasn't getting good care at a series of homes, he
repeatedly clashed with staffers.

Two weeks before Faughey's death, he 
got arrested in a scuffle with a security guard at a hospital where his 
mother was being treated.
