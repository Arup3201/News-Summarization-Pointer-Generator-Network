Two sheriff's deputies lost a loaded shotgun after they spent an hour driving around Los Angeles with the boot of their squad car open.

The chrome and bright yellow shotgun from the Los Angeles County Sheriff's Department disappeared from the open boot of the deputies' car as they drove from Agoura Hills to Hollywood.

It was inside a black canvas carrying case and ready loaded with four beanbag shells, of the kind intended for 'non-lethal' attacks.

However it is capable of acting as a regular gun if loaded with live ammunition, police said.

'The Los Angeles County Sheriff's Department is very concerned about finding this missing shotgun. The search is ongoing,' a spokesman said in a statement.

'The cause of the loss is under investigation, including to determine if the trunk latch was somehow blocked, if the trunk was not fully closed, or if the trunk latch somehow disengaged in transit.'

The two deputies from Lost Hills Sheriff's Station in Agoura Hills had loaded the shotgun into their car before before driving to attend a report of child abuse at a Hollywood hospital at about 7.30am on Saturday.

It was only an hour later, when they reached Sunset Boulevard in Hollywood, that they were flagged down by a passerby who warned them the boot of their car was ajar.

'They got out of their patrol car and saw the trunk was ajar about 2-3 inches,' a spokesman said. 'An inventory revealed the bean bag shotgun and its carrying case were no longer in the trunk.

'All other equipment was still in the trunk.'

Lost Hills Sheriff's Station deputies, Malibu/Lost Hills Search and Rescue Team deputies, and an LA County Sheriff's helicopter crew scoured the route the deputies had traveled without any luck.
