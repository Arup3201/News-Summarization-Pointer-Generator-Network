Everyone was surprised by President Obama's unplanned visit to Junior's Cheesecake in Brooklyn yesterday, but none more so than this excited little girl.

In a photograph posted to an offical White House Twitter account, the tiny girl looks up at the smiling President with an open-mouthed grin.

President Obama looks equally taken with the curly-headed little girl, who was at the restaurant having a meal with her family.

All set: U.S. President Barack Obama walks out with two bags of cheesecake from Junior's Restaurant next to Democratic Mayoral candidate Bill de Blasio in Brooklyn on Friday afternoon

Obama - who 
briefly lived in the New York borough in his younger days - visited
the restaurant yesterday with democratic mayoral candidate Bill de 
Blasio whom he introduced as the 'next mayor' to customers and staff. 

The president left with 
two cheesecakes - one traditional and the other strawberry.

And he was sure to grab some black-and-white cookies 'for his girls'.

The check came to $73 and he paid with $80 cash, according to owner Alan Rosen.

'He
said (his daughters) were going to eat the cookies on Air Force One on
the way back to Washington,' Mr Rosen told Politicker.

'He greeted every single customer and every single employee in the building, which was quite gracious and amazing to me. 

'Literally every single person.

'It was pretty incredible. We're pretty honored.'

The president also left behind a signature on one of the eatery's large holiday pumpkins.

Brooklyn resident Deborah Howard said she was enjoying her dinner when the president suddenly walked into the restaurant and couldn’t believe her eyes as he walked around the room, hugging people and shaking hands.

'It was great! … He said hello to everybody. They were hugging him and calling out,' she said.

'They applauded him leaving: ‘Thank you for coming. We love you!’ It was really great.'

Friday night crowd: Plenty were on hand for Obama's visit

Earlier in the day, the president admitted at least two of America's three branches of government needed to brush up on their math.

During a visit to the Pathways in Technology Early College High School (P-TECH) in the New York City borough of Brooklyn, Obama observed a level two algebra class, joking that he needed one of the students to help him keep his daughters' math skills up.

'The president joked with one of the girls that he needed her to tutor Sasha and Malia, because he's not very good at helping them with math anymore,' according to a pool reporter traveling with Obama.

Sasha and Malia, the Obamas' children, are in the seventh and tenth grades.

'I liked math, but then it started to get harder. And so that can be frustrating,' the president said, referring to his days as a student, the pool report continued.

But when Obama recalled the classroom visit an hour later in his speech to 600 students and teachers, it was Congress – not he – who needed help with numbers.

Adulation: Obama's job approval ratings nationally are abysmal, but he is still wildly popular in politically stalwart 'blue' states like New York, where he arrived at John F. Kennedy International Airport on Friday

'I know that budgets aren't the most interesting topic for a Friday afternoon,' he said while scolding legislators for the recent government shutdown tussle in Washington, 'even in a school where young people like math.'

'And by the way, I just sat in on a lesson called "Real World Math," which got me thinking whether it's too late to send Congress here for a remedial course.'

But the president's ribbing at Congress will be quickly forgotten, at least where it concerns those on the political left.

Obama will deliver another speech on Friday night – this time to a New York fundraiser for the Democratic Congressional Campaign Committee expected to raise up to $32,400 per person.
