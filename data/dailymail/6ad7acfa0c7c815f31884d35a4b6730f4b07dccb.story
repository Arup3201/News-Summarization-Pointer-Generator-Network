These wrens look to be home and hosed after they set up a somewhat unusual home in a garden hose reel.

The birds have gathered moss, horse hair and feathers to line their nest in the coiled hose in a garden in the New Forest.

Photographer Tim Withall, 74, found the unusual nest in his back garden.

These wrens could not look happier with their new unusual home in a hose reel

Photographer Tim Withall, 74, found the unusual nest in his back garden - and watched as the birds fetched moss to make their home more comfortable

Dinner time: He later spotted the doting parents feeding their young in the unconventional nest and quickly caught the moment on his camera

He later grabbed his camera and caught the doting parents feeding their young - helped by a friendly female robin who stepped in to bring the hungry chicks some bugs.

Mr Withall, a retired chartered engineer from Lyndhurst, Hampshire, said: 'I went over to use the rope over the hose reel and noticed the nest in the centre.

'At first I assumed it belonged to our resident robin family, but it contained moss, which would be an unusual nesting material for them.

Mr Withall watched the birds fly to and from the hose reel in his outbuilding (pictured) from his nearby campervan

Although wrens are regular visitors to British gardens it is rather odd to see them set up home in such a well used place

'Further inspection showed that it was a domed wrens’ nest and it was also lined with horse hair and feathers.

'I left well alone until I saw the pair bringing in food and grabbed my camera, using my campervan as a hide.

'While occasionally snapping the wrens’ progress, I was amazed to see the female robin also very energetically feeding the wren chicks too.

He said: 'The robin feeding the wren chicks rather took me by surprise, and all my bird watching friends couldn't believe it either'

'Her chicks had already flown their nest in the garage roof.

'This went on for almost a week, but I think she is now ensconced with her own second brood as food is so plentiful at the moment.

'The robin feeding the wren chicks rather took me by surprise, and all my bird watching friends couldn’t believe it either.

'I’d heard of long tailed tits helping feed other chicks of their type, but never of a bird feeding the young of another variety before.'
