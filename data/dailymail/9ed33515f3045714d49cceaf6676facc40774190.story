A little boy with epilepsy has not spoken a single word since he was diagnosed three years ago.

Bobby Hughes, now six, has been silent since he began suffering seizures.

The youngster, who is also autistic, may never be able to talk and his mother Cheryl communicates with him by recognising his noises.

Ms Hughes, 42, from
Droylsden, Greater Manchester, said: 'Bobby could say a few words - 
mum, dad, Woody from Toy Story, no - and then he developed epilepsy.

Silent: Six-year-old Bobby Hughes was diagnosed with epilepsy at the age of three and hasn't spoken a single word since

Bobby, who is also autistic, may never be able to talk and his mother Cheryl communicates with him by recognising his noises

'He had about five or six seizures and then his speech just disappeared.

'He was about three then and that's been it since. He has not said a word. It could be his autism or his seizures, we just don't know. 

'Bobby and I can communicate. I recognise his noises like you do with a baby, but he can't communicate with other people at all.

'He doesn't like going out and meeting other people because he knows they can't understand him.'

Both of the conditions Bobby suffers from may affect speech development.

People with autism may have major problems with both speech and nonverbal communication.

Speech problems include not talking at all, uttering grunts, cries, shrieks, or throaty, harsh sounds or humming or talking in a musical way.

The person may also babble with word-like sounds  or use foreign-sounding 'words' or robotic-like speech.

Epileptic activity in the brain may affect the development of language in children, the results of a new study indicate.

Bobby's mother Cheryl (with daughter Kyna) said he could say a few words before he suffered epileptic fits, but hasn't spoken a word since

Research from the University of Gothenburg has found that epilepsy is more common in children with speech and language difficulties.

There is also a condition called Landau-Kleffner syndrome (LKS) -  an age-related epilepsy syndrome of childhood.

The condition usually starts before the age of six  and affects twice as many boys as girls.

Its main features are a loss of speech and language skills with seizures. The speech and language skills may improve over time.

In an attempt to raise money for an iPad - in the hope it would help Bobby communicate - his late grandmother Pat launched the 'Give Bobby a Voice' appeal to collect more than 1,000 old mobile phones.

They
hope to trade them in for iPads with communication software, through 
the Hearts and Minds Challenge - a charity set up to improve the lives 
of people with autism.

Bobby's family are now trying to raise money for an iPad - in the hope it will help him communicate

His grandmother died last month before she could see her wish fulfilled but Cheryl has pledged to make it come true.

Mother-of-four Ms Hughes, who volunteers for the RSPCA, wants to get iPads for Bobby and the five other children in his class at Dukinfield's Oakdale Special School, and will need 185 phones for each device.

She said: 'The iPad would help him develop, help him lose some of the frustrations he has got and it would help him to be able to integrate into the outside world.'

Ms Hughes needs to collect 185 mobile phones for each iPad. These phones will be given to the charity Hearts and Minds and then sent on for recycling.

The money the charity is paid by the recycling company will then be used to purchase the iPads.
