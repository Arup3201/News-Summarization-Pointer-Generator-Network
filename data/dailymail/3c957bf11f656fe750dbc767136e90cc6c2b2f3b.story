A teenager has been fitted with a lifesaving under-the-skin defibrillator.

Blake Calverley, 18, has the same condition as former Bolton Wanderers’ player Fabrice Muamba.

But a device wired a device to his heart -  that can be seen bulging from the left side of his chest  - that has already saved his life several times.

It delivers a powerful shock without warning when his heart stops - something he describes as 'like a horse has kicked you in the chest'.

Blake Calverley suffers from the same heart rhythm condition as footballer Fabrice Muamba

The teeanger, from Accrington, Lancashire, suffers from hypertrophic cardiomyopathy, the same condition which caused Bolton Wanderer Fabrice Muamba’s heart to stop for 78 minutes during an FA Cup tie.

Doctors told him that without the machine, which measures around 12cm by 8cm, he would die.

Blake will eventually need to have a heart transplant and is urging others to sign up to the organ transplant register.

Despite having the device fitted, he says is too scared to even go out alone in case he takes a turn for the worst.

Blake, who this week became a father to 9lb 13oz Logan, was diagnosed with the condition in January 2011.

He was visiting the doctor for a regular diabetes check-up when the doctor became concerned as he had been suffering chest pains.

He was told his heart condition had caused him to develop Danon Disease, also known as ‘the silent killer’ as most sufferers die from the condition in their sleep before being diagnosed.

The disease weakens muscles and sufferers don’t usually live beyond the age of 19. 

In a bid to save him,  doctors fitted Blake with an Implantable Cardioverter Defibrillator (ICD) under his collar bone - the same device given to Muamba.

The device releases an electrical charge if it detects a heart malfunction.

But 11-months later doctors at Royal Manchester Infirmary replaced the battery operated device with a SICD defibrillator, which is much stronger

His mother Dawn Calverley, 47, said: 'Doctors have told us Blake’s condition is incurable.

'The defibrillator gives us piece of mind that there is something to restart his heart if it randomly stops when no one is around.

'But he is still scared. He has even stopped leaving the house because he doesn’t want to get a shock when he is alone. It’s horrible not being able to make him well.'

Blake, who dreams of becoming a professional chef, has been forced to give up playing football and riding his bike.  

He said: 'In a way I am scared of the thought of having a heart transplant. But if all goes well I have been told I will be able to play football again and get back to normal in general. 

'I have been told my condition is going to be monitored over the next six months and if it continues to deteriorate I will be placed on the transplant list.

'This time in a year I could have a new heart.'

Hypertrophic cardiomyopathy (HCM) is a condition where the heart muscle becomes thickened.

Around one in 5,000 people have the condition, and it most commonly develops during the teenage years or young adulthood.

However, the symptoms vary depending on the severity. These include shortness of breath, chest pain, palpitations, dizziness and fainting attacks - most commonly during exercise.

It can cause the heart muscle to become stiff, which means your left ventricle doesn't fill as easily as normal and less blood is then pumped out.

It can also partially obstruct blood flow, which can make small blood clots more likely.

In some people, the abnormal heart muscle affects the electrical conducting system of the heart. This may cause abnormal heart rates and rhythms to develop.

Sudden collapse and death occurs in a small number of people with HCM. This is probably due to a severe arrhythmia which may develop suddenly

Most cases are hereditary so screening of close family members is advised.
