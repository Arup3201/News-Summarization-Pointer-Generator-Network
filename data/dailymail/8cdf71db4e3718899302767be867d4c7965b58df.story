Shot dead: Gang member Joseph Thompson who was ambushed and had up to nine bullets sprayed at him in the early hours of today

A feud between rival gangs responsible for the murder of schoolboy Rhys Jones is feared to have erupted with the killing of a crimelord in Liverpool.

Joe Thompson, 30, had been a leading member of the notorious Strand gang which runs underworld drugs rackets in the Norris Green area of the city.

The father was shot dead in the early hours of this morning while a 27-year-old man was also left fighting for life.

The double shooting is thought to be a turf war between the Strand and rivals Crocky Crew who were blamed for the 2007 murder of Rhy Jones, 11.

The gunman, who was carrying a handgun, blasted up to nine shots at Thompson and an unnamed friend during an ambush.

The second victim was today being treated at University Hospital, in Aintree, where his condition was described as 'critical'.

Armed police were today patrolling the notorious estate following the killing.

The street of semi-detached homes was sealed-off by today as officers were carrying out house-to-house inquiries.

Schoolboy Rhys Jones was murdered as he walked home from football practice in Croxeth, Liverpool, by Sean Mercer who fled the scene on a bicycle.

The clans have, in the past, waged 'turf' war against each other which resulted in the death of eleven year old Rhys.

In 2006 Thompson was identified by police as one of the leading members of the Strand gang.

Together with the Darren Smith, the brother of murdered gang member Liam 'Smigger' Smith, he was given an ABSO aimed at disrupting his activities.

Thompson's son today left a tribute to his father at the scene of the shooting, saying: 'RIP dad GBNF (gone but not forgotten)'. Underneath, he had drawn a heart.

One local resident, aged 59, said: 
'It used to be a nice neighbourhood but now it’s ruled by thugs. I heard
a couple of shots at about 1am and it woke me up. The next thing we 
knew the area was filled with police.

'Thompson’s a known name around here 
and it is a gang area but the child’s message is heart rending. I just 
want to get away as soon as I can I’ve already put my house up for sale.'

A spokesman for Merseyside Police said: 'Emergency services were called to Ravensthorpe Green at about 1am to a report that two men had been injured after being shot at in the street.

'On arrival officers found a man, believed to be in his 30s, who was declared dead at the scene by paramedics and a man, who is believed to be in his 20s, with a gunshot injuries.

'The injured man was taken to hospital by ambulance for treatment. At this time his condition is described as being critical.

'The scene has been cordoned off, house-to-house enquiries are under way and high- visibility patrols have been stepped-up in the area.

'The motive for the shooting is not yet clear and officers are appealing for anyone with information to come forward.

'An investigation to establish the full circumstances of the incident is in hand.'

Local councillor Barry Kushner said: 'This is a shocking and appalling act of violence. It’s been quiet over the last 12 months. Crime has gone down and we’ve had a reduction of serious crime in the area.

'What we want is for people to help with the police’s inquiry and to provide information. In terms of using words like ‘gang’ it is giving credibility to these people where it is not in any way deserved. We are talking about a tiny, small criminal element that you get in most areas.

'Of course people are worried, it is a natural response but there will be a greater police presence in the area. I’m comfortable that with the police presence there will not be a retaliation.

'There has been shootings across Liverpool over the last year and we are trying to improve his area with security and will be holding a meeting tomorrow in light of the events to give confidence to the community.

'People should not be carrying guns, especially in an area where there are children. People should not have to deal with this.'

Probe: Merseyside Police have launched an investigation into the double shooting and are carrying out house-to-house inquiries
