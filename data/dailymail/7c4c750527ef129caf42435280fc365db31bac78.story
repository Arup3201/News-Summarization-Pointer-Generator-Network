Frank Lampard may be edging ever-closer to leaving the British Isles for the foreseeable future, but he made sure he squeezed in a quick pint of Guinness before his possible departure to New York City at the end of this month.

Taking some time out to visit the family of fiancee Christine Bleakley in the scenic Northern Irish countryside, the Manchester City midfielder, who is on loan from New York City FC, posed with his significant other holding aloft a glass of the famous Irish beverage. 

'Sun was shining on a lovely weekend with the family in Northern Ireland. Would have been rude not to have a cheeky pint of the black stuff!' the former Chelsea star said.

The 36-year-old started against West Bromwich Albion on Saturday but has grown frustrated at his general lack of game time at City of late and after New York's promising start to the MLS season he could be tempted to make the switch before the end of this term.

And if he's concerned about missing his home comforts, Lampard need not worry about being short of places to get hold of a pint of the Black Stuff during his time in the Big Apple, which is home to a large population of Irish-American inhabitants.

Famed for its extravagant St Patrick's Day celebrations, the former England international might be a bit late for this year's celebrations, but if things continue to go as well for his new side there could be a few more rounds for him and the future Mrs. Lampard come this time next year.
