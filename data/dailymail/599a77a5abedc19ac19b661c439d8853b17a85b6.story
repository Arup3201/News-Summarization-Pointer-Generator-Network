As blood pumps from a bullet wound in her thigh, passers-by apply a makeshift tourniquet to save the life of a British tourist gunned down by a mugger in Barbados.

The 59-year-old woman and her husband, 72, were shot and robbed as they returned to their cruise ship after a stopover on the Caribbean island.

The couple, named locally last night as Philip and Ann Prior, from Woodbridge in Suffolk, had been on a three-month P&O cruise. Mr Prior was shot in the side of the pelvis during the attack near the harbour in the capital, Bridgetown, on Sunday afternoon.

Passers-by tended their wounds, using
towels as bandages, until an ambulance arrived to take them to the 
Queen Elizabeth Hospital for emergency treatment.

Mr and Mrs Prior were said last night to be in a ‘comfortable’ condition in hospital.

The Royal Barbados Police Force said that the attacker stole Mrs Prior’s handbag and fled.

‘It appears the incident was a 
robbery,’ said a police spokesman. ‘They are currently receiving medical
attention but are not in a life-threatening condition.

‘They are talking to our detectives 
to assist with the investigation. We believe the couple were on the way 
back to their cruise ship.’ 

Mr and Mrs Prior were on an 85-day South American Odyssey cruise on the P&O ship Adonia.
It was during a stopover in Bridgetown that they were shot and robbed in Hincks Street shortly after 2pm on Sunday.

The Adonia, one of P&O’s smaller vessels with space for 710 passengers, has left Barbados and was last night in St Lucia.

The man, in his 70s, was shot in the left side, while the woman, in her 50s, was shot in the right thigh as they made their way back to their cruise ship

The Adonia: The P&O ship is on a three-month cruise. The cruise left Southampton on January 8

The cruise, which costs  from about 
£10,000 per person, left Southampton on January 8. The Adonia had 
already visited Brazil, Argentina, Chile, Peru, Uruguay and the 
Falkland Islands. It is due back in Southampton  on April 3.

Less than three hours after the 
shooting, more than 100 people on the Jolly Roger pleasure boat  trip 
were returned to shore in Bridgetown  at the request of police and 
coastguards.

The boat was met by more than 20 
armed members of the Police Special Services Unit as well as police dogs
and their handlers. While police said it was a ‘routine’ operation, it 
was believed to be linked to the earlier shooting as passengers were 
questioned and searched. At least two men were taken to their cars, 
which were also searched.

After more than an hour, passengers were permitted to board the boat again and it was allowed to leave the harbour.

About 250,000 British tourists visit 
Barbados every year and many celebrities, including Sir Cliff Richard, 
Cilla Black and Gary Lineker, have homes there.

Attacks on Britons visiting the 
island are rare, the Foreign and Commonwealth Office says. However, in 
January this year, Dr James Bridges, 72, and his wife Olga, 62, were 
attacked by a knife-wielding intruder moments after arriving at their 
holiday villa. Dr Bridges was stabbed three times while his wife 
suffered a punctured spleen.

In 2010, two women were raped while 
on holiday on the island. A man was cleared of the attacks last year 
after the victims, Dr Rachel Turner, 30 and Diane Davies, 63, testified 
that police had the wrong man. The assailant is still at large.

In 2005, Daniel May, 20, was shot 
dead as he wrestled with two armed intruders who tried to enter the 
luxury villa he was sharing with his parents. He was shot once in head 
and twice in the chest.
