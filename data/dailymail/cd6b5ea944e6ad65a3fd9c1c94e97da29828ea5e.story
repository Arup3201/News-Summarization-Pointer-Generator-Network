The Los Angeles Fire Department says a ruptured oil pipe has caused about 10,000 gallons of crude 
oil to spill on to the city's streets.

The oil - which covers a half-mile area 
and is knee-high in some places - escaped after a break in an above-ground pipeline outside 5175 West San Fernando Road in the Atwater Village suburb.

According
 to Los Angeles Fire Department, oil was spurting 15 to 20 feet into the air from a burst 20-inch pipe, with the leak
 reported shortly after midnight local time.

Clean up: Hazardous material specialists are also working at the scene amid concern that the massive spill could cause an environmental disaster. Fire Department spokesman Erik Scott says there is currently no 'visible evidence' that the oil has entered storm drains

Sweep: Workers try to prevent the vast quantities of crude oil flowing into storm drains. The drains empty into the Los Angeles River and there is concern the spill could cause serious harm to wildlife if the oil gets into the water supply

Washed away: The clean up operation is focusing on storm drains and manhole covers amid concern that the crude oil could seep into the water supply and cause public health problems and damage to wildlife

Spill: The oil - which covers a half-mile area and is knee-high in some places - escaped after a break in an above-ground pipeline outside 5175 West San Fernando Road in Atwater Village

Evacuated: Five commercial businesses - including The Gentlemen's Club strip bar - were affected after LAPD completely shut down the Atwater Village area

The flow of oil to the pipe was remotely shut down shortly within 10 minutes of the burst being detected, but the leak continued for another 45 minutes.

A 20-inch oil pipeline is medium-sized by industry standards and would generally transport about 200,000 barrels per day based on average rates. There was no immediate information about the specific capacity or throughput of the line.

'This oil comes from the Bakersfield area, this is a pumping transfer station and pumping transfer station then transfers the oil to a storage facility in Long Beach,' Batallion Chief David Spence said.

Four workers at the nearby Baxter industrial plant were reportedly evaluated for general illness and respiratory concerns, with two of them taken to hospital, according to NBC Los Angeles,

Oil was seen shooting towards the sky and on to a nearby strip bar, The Gentlemenâ€™s Club at around 1am local time. The Gentlemen's Club was subsequently evacuated, Los Angeles Fire Department said.

Location: The oil escaped after a break in an above-ground pipeline outside 5175 West San Fernando Road in the Atwater Village suburb of Los Angeles.

Several blocks near San Fernando Road and West Broadway have been evacuated, with Department of Transportation understood to be assisting with the build up of traffic in the Greendale suburb.

Hazardous material specialists are also working at the scene amid concern that the massive spill could cause an environmental disaster.

Fire Department spokesman Erik Scott says there's no 'visible evidence' that the oil has entered storm drains, which empty into the Los Angeles River, but he says it's possible that oil has seeped under manhole covers.

The department initially said one million gallons of oil had spilled, but subsequently revised the estimate down to 50,000 gallons and then again to 10,000.

'We are on hand vacuuming up the spilled oil, mopping up what's left behind and pressure washing the area with a soap solution,' said Captain Jamie Moore, a public information officer with the Los Angeles Fire Department

'The responders are mopping what's on the ground with absorbent diapers,' he added. The cleanup is expected to take 24 hours.

Atwater Village is a neighborhood in the 13th district of Los Angeles.

Located in the northeast region of the city, Atwater borders Griffith Park and Silver Lake to the west, Glendale to the north and east, and Glassell Park to the south.

Almost half the residents were born outside the U.S. - a high percentage for the city of Los Angeles.
