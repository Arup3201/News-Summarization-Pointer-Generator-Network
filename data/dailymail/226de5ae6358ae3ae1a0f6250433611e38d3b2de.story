Since the age of 20, Ron Kline has done the same thing almost every day.

The father of  11, now 70, leaves the home he shares with his wife of half-a-century, Lois, in Loudonville, Ohio, and heads to work at the same company. 

The grandfather of 38 then sits behind the wheel of his truck and starts his delivery run for Mansfield Plumbing in Ohio.

Despite the repetitive routine, Mr Klein has stuck with the same company for 50 years and has never taken a sick day - making him one of America's hardest working people.

America's hardest worker? Ron Kline, 70, has been working at Mansfield Plumbing in Perrysville, Ohio, for 50 years - and hasn't had a single sick day 

In January, Mr Kilne celebrated the milestone with his colleagues, but he insists retirement is not an option.   

'I enjoy the people and what I do, so why should I consider retiring' he told Contractor Magazine. 

'This company has been a great place to have a career and it's been good to my entire family.

'Right now my son Jeff and my daughter Julie are both working at Mansfield, along with my brother, Elmer. Two other brothers, Richard and Jerry, recently retired from the company. 

He added: 'I'm basically a happy, healthy person which has allowed me to work so long without a sick day. 

'I'm very blessed. With 38 grandchildren there are lots of family activities to get involved in, so it keeps me busy. But retirement isn't even an option ... I really enjoy my job and working for Mansfield is a huge part of my life.' 

'Together the Kline family has about 220 combined years of service at Mansfield.'

Mr Klein was recruited in January 1965 as a clean-up person at the company's manufacturing facility.

For 18 years he inspected sanitary products after they came out of the kiln. 

He said: 'I checked for cracks and blemishes to make sure the quality was there for each and every piece that went out the door.' Around 32 years ago he started to drive the truck and has been doing it ever since. 

'We wish we could clone Ron', Jim Morando, president of Mansfield Plumbing, said. 'He shows up every day and throughout the entire day he is committed to being part of the solution.'

If the job and huge family wasn't enough, Mr Kline also coached softball and basketball at the local high school for decades.
