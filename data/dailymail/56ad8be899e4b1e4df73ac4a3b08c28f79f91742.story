Punishment: Simoneau, pictured here in court Thursday, faces 11 years in prison when he is sentenced April 30

Troubled marriage: Prosecutors said Simoneau filed for divorce in 2002 but then changed his mind after his wife inherited a substantial sum of money from relatives in Japan 

Simoneau originally had faced a murder charge punishable by a 25-year sentence, but it was later downgraded to one count of voluntary manslaughter as part of a plea deal.

Fumoko Ogawa, 41, was last seen alive January 4, 2007, near her home in Point Loma, California.

After being unable to reach Ogawa for nearly a year, her family in Japan raised the alarm about her disappearance, but her husband never reported her missing, said NBC San Diego.

Her body was found January 20, 2007, near the Bow Willow Campground in California’s Anza-Borrego desert, but she was not positively identified until June 2011. By that time, her husband had left the state.

According to published reports, Anthony Simoneau filed for divorce in 2002 after six years of marriage, but had a change of heart upon learning that his wife inherited a substantial sum of money from her family in Japan. 

When Fumiko went missing, police said her husband went on a spending spree, buying four luxury SUVs, four boats, a motorcycle and three other vehicles, according to Honolulu Star-Advertiser.

Mystery: Ogawa was last since in early January 2007. Her remains were discovered in weeks later buried in a shallow grave in the California desert. By the time they were identified, her husband (right) had fled 

Nabbed: Last year, police tracked down Simoneau in Oahu, Hawaii, and had him extradited 

Several months later, Simoneau picked up and moved to Hawaii, where he got a job as a tour guide on Oahu.

Last September, detectives investigating Fumkio Ogawa's killing tracked down her husband and had him extradited back to California.

According to Simoneau's plea agreement, the man killed his spouse because of a 'sudden quarrel in the heat of passion.'

Initially, Fumkio Ogawa's remains uncovered in a shallow grave in the California desert were thought to be an unfortunate border crosser, but a DNA test determined that it was the missing woman.

Prosecutors said the cause of death remains unknown to this day because of the body's deteriorated condition.

Throughout the investigation, Simoneau repeatedly insisted that he had nothing to do with Ogawa’s killing. During a court appearance after his arrest in Hawaii, a defiant Simoneau told the judge that he was looking forward to having his day in court and proving his innocence, reported KHON2.

Crime of passion: The plea agreement states that the 46-year-old husband killed his wife in a heat of passion during a fight 

‘I miss my wife very much and I will state, for the record, I did not kill my wife. I love her very much okay,’ said Simoneau to Hawaii News Now in 2011.

But when a California judge asked him Thursday how he pleads to his wife’s killing, a dejected Simoneau replied: ‘Guilty, your honor.’

Chieko Ogawa, the victim’s mother, told a Japanese TV station that she was disappointed with the outcome of the case.

‘The sentence is so light,’ she lamented in an interview with NTV. ‘He got let off easy. We waited eight years and this is all we get. It’s unfair.’

However, the plea deal will speed up the process of releasing Fumiko Ogawa's body to her family in Japan for burial.
