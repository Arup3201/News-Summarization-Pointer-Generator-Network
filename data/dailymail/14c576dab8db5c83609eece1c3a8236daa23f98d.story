Parents of a young girl were stunned when they were told by hospital staff their daughter would have to get the train home after having brain surgery.

Caroline Zaple-Davies, 50, and husband Simon, said there was no way their 13-year-old daughter Katie was well enough to travel on the train minutes claiming she had only come out of surgery minutes before.

Katie from Torquay, Devon suffers from a brain tumour, has had several operations at Frenchay Hospital, Bristol in the past and the hospital has always provided transport home.

On Thursday March 27 she was taken by hospital transport to Frenchay for another operation scheduled that day.

A delay caused the procedure to be pushed back to Saturday March 29, and afterwards the surgeon told her she was well enough to go home.

But instead of organising transport, which had been provided for her before, they told her the train was the best option.

Katie's brain tumor told has caused her to have several surgeries in the past

Mother Caroline, 50, who was at the hospital, said: 'I was just sat by the bed when I presume a Sister dressed in dark blue came into the ward and said, "is there anything I can do for you?"

'I said we'd come up in ambulance transport and we'd be needing some transport back to Torquay.

'Straight away she said, "no we don't do transport back."

'I said "but we went up in the ambulance so how were we expected to get back?"

'She said that there was always the train.

'I was horrified when she said it - I thought she was joking.

'Bearing in mind Katie had just had surgery and the main rail line at Dawlish was out of action at that time.

'I explained that to her and she said, "I suppose it's not ideal."

'Katie was in bed listening to all this.

'She's been hospital lots and lots of times and she heard that she had to go home on the train - I just think it's not on.'

Katie's father Mr Davies added they always had transport provided previously when she'd been in for surgery.

He said: 'Last time she went in the hospital provided a taxi. The time before that it was a hospital transport. And the time before that was hospital transport too.

Frenchay Hospital in Bristol, has always provided transport in the past after Katie has had a surgery

'I mean she can hardly move her head after surgery. It's not fair - there's no compassion. It takes the biscuit.'

Simon who has sight problems and couldn't drive them home managed to arrange a taxi for Katie and Caroline at a cost of over Â£100.

The hospital said they were looking into the incident but say that because it was the weekend providing transport may have been more difficult.

Frenchay Hospital claims that because the surgery took place on the weekend, they couldn't provide transport. They did offer to provide reimbursement for costs to travel home

Mrs Zaple-davies said: 'I don't think that's acceptable.Katie was diagnosed when she two.

'We've done lots and lots with her - I just feel let down.'

A spokesman for Frenchay said they were disappointed the family was unhappy, but that it wasn't possible to organise transport because it was the weekend.

They also said they'd offered to sort it out on the Monday and reimburse them the cost of the taxi fare.
