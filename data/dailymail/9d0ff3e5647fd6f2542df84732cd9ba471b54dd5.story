Jailed pedophile Rolf Harris has abandoned his push to appeal 12 convictions for sexually assaulting four girls in the United Kingdom.

Harris's initial application was refused by a single Court of Appeal judge in late October and the disgraced entertainer is now out of time to ask the court to revisit the issue.

Harris was sentenced in July to five years and nine months' jail for indecently assaulting four girls in Britain between 1968 and 1986, however he's expected to serve less than three years behind bars.

Harris has abandoned his push to appeal 12 convictions for sexually assaulting four girls in the United Kingdom, after failing to ask for a hearing before three Appeal Court judges

A Judicial Office spokesman on Monday confirmed  that Harris hadn't renewed his application to appeal 'and he is now out of time'.

The 84-year-old Australian had 28 days to ask for a hearing before three Appeal Court judges but chose not to.  

Among his victims was an eight-year-old autograph hunter, two teenage girls and a friend of his daughter whom he abused for over 16 years.

Jurors were told that the ongoing sexual abuse against his daughter's friend 'haunted' her and made her abandon her dreams.

During the trial, Harris was described as an ‘octopus’ because of his reputation for wandering hands and his systematic abuse of young girls than spanned over a quarter of a century.

After he was exposed, Harris was stripped of his BAFTA fellowship and a number of other honours.

The formerly celebrated performer now faces losing his CBE, a prestigious award  he received from the Queen in 2006.

In October it was reported Harris could face fresh charges as a result of more than 10 new victims claiming they were abused by the disgraced entertainer

During his lengthy trial another six women gave supporting evidence that Harris abused them in Australia, New Zealand and Malta between 1969 and 1991.

Harris wasn't charged over those alleged incidents because they occurred outside the UK.

In mid-October a British newspaper reported Harris could face fresh charges as a result of more than 10 new victims claiming they were abused by the disgraced artist and singer.

It was claimed Operation Yewtree officers were looking at the British cases while any assaults that took place in Australia or New Zealand would be handled by local police.

The Metropolitan police have refused to comment on the possibility of further charges being laid.

It was also reported in mid-October that Harris had to be moved to a new prison for his own safety after being bullied by inmates.

The convicted sex offender was moved from HMP Bullingdon in Oxfordshire to Stafford jail after being taunted by fellow prisoners.
