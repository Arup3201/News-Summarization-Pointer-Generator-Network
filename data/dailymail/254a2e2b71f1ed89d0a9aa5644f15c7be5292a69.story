Two women have been attacked by a dingoes on the west coast of Fraser Island, about 300km north of Brisbane.

The two tourists were jogging on the beach at Yidney Rocks when they were bitten 'quite heavily' on the legs just before 7am on Sunday morning.

The manager of the Yidney Rocks Beachfront Unit, Maijam Goulding, said the two Australian tourists were in their 20's or 30's.

They asked me to make a phone call (to triple zero) because I'm the only one with a phone here,' she said.

The women were staying in accommodation in Yidney Rocks, which Ms Goulding said had a small dingo population.

'It's pretty silent here but you don't go running on the beach. That's a big no-no,' she said.

'Everybody needs to stay vigilant. That's the way it is, it's been like that for many years.'

'You don't take silly risks.'

A spokesperson from the media department of Hervey Bay Hospital said at least one of the women were being taken to the hospital via the island's barge, and had presented with wounds consistent with dingo bites, though they could not verify the story at present.

He further noted that as she was not flown out from the site of the incident, her condition could not have been too serious. 

A spokeswoman for the RACQ CareFlight rescue helicopter said a crew had been placed on standby over the incident but had been stood down. 

Dingoes are protected in Queensland national parks as a native species, though the animal is a declared pest outside of these areas.

On Fraser Island, dingoes are considered part of the native ecology and are therefore protected by state law. 

A safety manual released by the Queensland government advises parents to stay close to children as dingoes have been known to bite, and stresses that dingoes should never be fed by humans. 

The manual advises campers to secure all food and rubbish, walk in groups and keep distance from the animals.
