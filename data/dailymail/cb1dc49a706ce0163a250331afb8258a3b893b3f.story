After a historic and emotional win at the grand final by the South Sydney Rabbitohs, one of its footy stars has lost their NRL premiership ring.

The Rabbitohs centre reportedly dropped his prized possession into Sydney Harbour just less than a week after receiving it.

Perth Now reports that Walker lost the ring whilst on a team cruise on Wednesday as players continued their celebrations following Sunday night's 30-6 victory over the Canterbury Bulldogs.

South Sydney team members and fans alike have been celebrating their premiership win from Sunday night - their first in 43 years.

And the festivities continued today with a parade through Sydney before the team received the keys to the city.

Earlier in the week, the team received a heroic welcome as they mingled with thousands of Rabbitoh's fans who crammed into and around Redfern Oval on Monday afternoon to commend the club's long-awaited grand final win.

But on Thursday afternoon, reporter Ben Fordham tweeted: 'Souths player Dylan Walker has already LOST his NRL Premiership ring.'

'Dylan Walker's NRL premiership ring is on the bottom of Sydney Harbour. He dropped it while on a boat yesterday. Souths trying to replace it,' he wrote.  

However it is unknown the NRL have not confirmed whether or not they will be providing Walker with a replacement ring.

Daily Mail Australia is also waiting a response from the South Sydney Rabbitohs.
