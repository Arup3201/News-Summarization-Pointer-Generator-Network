Prince Charles was asked by Government Ministers for permission to introduce a Bill that would have stripped him of some of  his powers, including his right to  veto legislation

Prince Charles was asked by Government Ministers for permission to introduce a Bill that would have stripped him of some of  his powers, including his right to veto legislation.

Private letters obtained by The Mail on Sunday under Freedom of Information laws show that Chloe Smith, the former Minister for Political and Constitutional Reform, wrote to Charles to seek his ‘consent’ for the Private Member’s Bill – which he gave some weeks later.

The Bill failed at its second reading but sources close to Labour peer Lord Berkeley, who introduced it into Parliament, say a new draft version has now been sent to Charles.

The correspondence sheds new light on the process whereby Ministers are required to seek Charles’s consent for any draft Bills that have implications for his Duchy of Cornwall estate.

In theory he can veto any aspect of a Bill that might affect the interests of the estate, which has land and property holdings worth £700 million.

On October 2 last year, Ms Smith’s office wrote to William Nye, the Prince’s private secretary, asking for consent for the Rights of the Sovereign and the Duchy of Cornwall Bill.

The letter read: ‘I am writing to ask if His Royal Highness would be pleased to give his consent in respect of the Rights of the Sovereign and the Duchy of Cornwall Bill.

‘This letter explains the intent of the particular areas where we consider that it requires the  consent of the Prince of Wales to be sought.

‘I attach a copy of the Bill which would remove the current requirement for Queen’s and Prince’s consent to be given to some pieces of legislation, transfer the assets and property from the Duchy of Cornwall to a public trust and remove the male bias in the descent of the title; and limit which members of the of the Royal Family may claim travel expenses under what circumstances.’

In his reply of October 30, Nye wrote: ‘I can confirm the Duke of Cornwall’s consent to place his  prerogative and interests at the disposal of Parliament.’

The documents reveal that Ministers in the Cabinet Office sought Charles’s consent for three different measures between September  1, 2013, and January  27, 2014. 

The idea that Bills should require the consent of either the Queen or Prince Charles has come under increasing criticism.

Last month MPs on the Political and Constitutional Reform Committee branded the rules ‘arcane and complex’.

Critics were particularly scathing about the decision to refer Lord Berkeley’s Bill to the heir to the throne.

A spokesman for the Cabinet Office said: ‘The need to signal the Queen’s and Prince’s consent for certain Bills is a long-standing parliamentary requirement and the parliamentary authorities decide when it  is required.’

A spokesman for Clarence House declined to comment but said that consent had been given on every occasion in the modern era.
