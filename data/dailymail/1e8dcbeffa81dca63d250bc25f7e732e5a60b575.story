A man whose scrotum swelled to more than 100lbs over the past decade has successfully undergone surgery to have it removed.

Dan Maurer, from Battle Creek, Michigan, suffers 
from scrotal lymphedema - an ailment that has caused one of his 
testicles to become abnormally large.

Now, thanks to 14-hour surgery, the growth has been removed.

Massive problem: Dan Maurer, 39, suffers from a rare condition called scrotal lymphedema, which caused his scrotum to become unusually large and weigh 120lbs. He has now undergone successful surgery to remove the growth

'He's come through the surgery fine,' his mother Connie told the New York Daily News.

The 39-year-old said his condition had affected his relationship with wife of 20 years, Mindy.

But following the life-changing surgery, the couple may be able to resume sexual relations.

The couple reportedly have not been intimate in seven years due to Dan's illness.

Mindy is now by his side as he recovers from the surgery, which took place at the University of California, Irvine, on August 28th.

The mass in his scrotum was found to weigh 120lb and Mr Maurer also had some stomach fat removed during the surgery too - so is now 150lb lighter, the Daily News reports.

Mrs Maurer told the Battle Creek Enquirer: '[The doctor] is very pleased with the surgery and healing.

His father added: 'Hopefully, it's the start of a whole new life for him,' his father added.

It is the next, and largest, step for Maurer and his battle with the rare disease scrotal lymphedema in which the scrotum grows abnormally large because of what doctors believe are blocked vessels in the lymphatic system that fail to drain the fluid from the area.

Nervous and excited: Maurer said before the surgery that he was looking forward to having sex with his wife, Mindy (left), for the first time in seven years

However he is having trouble walking after the operation, having carried the growth for so long, his mother said.

'He
 told me, "Mom, I thought when (they finished the surgery) I could bound
 out of that bed like a new man",' she told the newspaper. 'He's moving 
baby steps, but he wants to move (in) giant steps.'

He is now undergoing physiotherapy and should be able to return home in a month.

Scrotal lymphedema is a disease that is 
caused by blockage of the lymphatic vessels in which tissue builds up 
outside of the testicles, resulting in swelling.

The tale of Mr Maurer's struggle went viral earlier this summer 
after a series of stories appeared online documenting the man's efforts 
to raise money for a costly and dangerous surgery to remove the growth 
on his scrotum.

The publicity allowed him raise close to $30,000 towards the operation, which was performed Thursday in California.

Hours before the operation, Maurer took to his GoFundMe page to post an update about the upcoming operation.  

'My surgery
 is in 2 hours. So this might be my last post. I love you all and I can 
not thank you enough for your support in all of this,' he wrote.

'My
 wife is everything to me and to get a second chance to give her then 
man she deserves means a lot to me. I will post as soon as I can if 
andwhen I wake up.'

Speaking to the New York Daily News before going under the knife, Mr Maurer reiterated he was anxious, but that the risk was well worth it.

'With the surgery, my life is on the line and losing my penis is on the line,' he said.

He added he was excited about the prospect of having sex with his wife for the first time in seven years.

Beside marital relations, he said he was ooking forward to doing more traveling and riding a jet ski. 

He said he first noticed that something was wrong with his anatomy when he was in his 20s.

After seeking medical help when his scrotum started getting bigger, doctors informed him that he has to lose weight.

‘I was doing two miles a day in the pool, so I lost 50lbs like that,’ he said..

But
 even as he was shedding the extra pounds, his scrotum continued 
expanding, eventually ballooning to the size of a large cantaloupe 
melon. 

‘The bigger it gets it seems to me like the faster it grows. When he stands it almost hangs to his ankles,’ Mrs Maurer told My Fox Detroit.

'Misdiagnosed': Maurer first noticed that something was amiss with his body in his 20s, but doctors told him he just needed to lose weight

Setback: Maurer was able to shed 50lbs through daily exercise, but his scrotum continued growing

After consulting with physicians he got the same response as before: he must lose more weight.

‘As far as they were concerned, I had to have lap-band surgery to lose weight,’ he told the station KSDK.

He ventually fell ill and had to be hospitalised with what turned out to be a broken cyst inside his oversize scrotum.

Then one day, he came across the TLC reality show The Man With The 132 Pound Scrotum about the plight of Wesley Warren Jr.

At that moment, he knew what was wrong with him.

He then discovered that his only hope was Dr Joel Gelman, a California-based urologist who operated on Wesley Warren in April 2013 to remove his outsized growth.

Warren passed away in March of this year at age 49. It is believed he died from complications with diabetes.

Gelman has agreed to perform the dangerous operation to remove Maurer's massive growth, but the urologist is not in the patient's medical network and the procedure is not covered by his insurance.

In the case of Wesley Warren, Dr Gelman agreed to treat him free of charge.

Dan Maurer has launched a campaign on the site GoFundMe.com to raise $20,000 toward the surgery. As of Thursday afternoon, people have donated over $27,200.
