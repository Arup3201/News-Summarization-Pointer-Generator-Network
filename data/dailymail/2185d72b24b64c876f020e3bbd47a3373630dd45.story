Paulie Malignaggi believes the time is now for Floyd Mayweather Jnr to face Manny Pacquiao – but has backed Amir Khan to pose the bigger problem for the pound-for-pound No 1.

Mayweather and Pacquiao have so far failed to agree terms for the biggest fight in history but after the latter's victory over Chris Algieri last weekend, speculation has grown that it could finally happen next May.

But Malignaggi, who lost to Khan in 2010, is confident the Brit is a real threat to Mayweather's unbeaten record, assuming he can overcome Devon Alexander at the MGM Grand on December 13.

'The Pacquiao fight is the one everyone wants and demands; that's the fight that will sell most,' he told Sportsmail.

'There's a lot of momentum with the Pacquiao fight, more than I've seen before so if it's ever to be made, now is the time. I'm hearing that they're really pushing to make it but if Amir puts in a great performance on December 13, he'll take a lot of attention away from Pacquiao and make a big statement.

'I do feel in my heart that Amir is more of a threat to Floyd and he is the greatest risk to Mayweasther's undefeated record.

'I know some people don't agree with that because of the fanfare Pacquiao has but this is not a popularity contest. Styles win fights and I believe Amir has a style that will give Mayweather a lot more trouble than Pacquiao.

'If the Pacquiao fight doesn't come off and Amir comes through against Devon, he deserves a shot at Mayweather.'

Malignaggi is also confident that Khan will overcome Alexander next month, a fight that sees the 2004 Olympic silver medalist return to Sky Sports.

'It's a solid fight between two top welterweights,' he added. 'Amir has gone through something of an evolution since losing to Danny Garcia. He hasn't changed his style but he's a bit more intelligent.

'At first he didn't look so impressive and even I was starting to wonder if he was finished but in the last fight he showed a brand new psychological confidence. He still has all the ability technically but now he's mentally in a good zone and it shows in his boxing.

'The guys who box don't have success against Amir but guys who punch wild and are not scared to punch with him do and in those cases he's been caught. People like Breidis Prescott and Danny Garcia and even Marcos Maidana at times gave Amir a ton of trouble.

'Ultimately, to box Amir is a very difficult thing to do because he knows how to win rounds. Devon is a very good boxer but I'm not sure he'll be handle Amir's style.'

Paulie Malignaggi will be attending the 'Vegas Fight Night Comes To Manchester Event' along with many other top names from the boxing, sport and entertainment world on January 31 at Event City. For more info on tickets please go to www.mcrsportsandentertainment.com
