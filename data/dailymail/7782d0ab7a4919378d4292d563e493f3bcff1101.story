Meet the man who has given up a dead-end job as a computer engineer to earn a living playing corpses in films and TV shows.

Chuck Lamb, 56, is 'Dead Body Guy' and regularly spends hours creating gruesome scenarios along with his wife who photographs him playing dead.

Mr Lamb, from Ohio, rakes in up to 
$1,500 a day from his ability to be the perfect dead body – and thinks 
he’d be dead good on Britain’s Celebrity Big Brother show.

Lamb to the slaughter: Chuck used to be a computer engineer but decided in 2005 to pursue a career in the film and TV industry, playing corpses

Mr Lamb told MailOnline that anyone can play dead. Here's how:

Mr Lamb's
 adventures started when he was watching an episode of police detective 
drama Law & Order: Special Victims Unit with his wife Tonya, 46.

He
 realised that despite not having leading-man looks, he might be able 
realise his life-long dream of being an actor by playing dead thanks to 
his corpse-like appearance.

Within a week he had set up a website and his wife was thinking up ways to 'kill him' - all for the benefit of the camera.

Never
 thinking that his new hobby would go viral, Tonya went about making 
fake blood and posing him up being run over by 4x4s, crushed under a garage 
door and electrocuted by a toaster.

His website - deadbodyguy.com - became an unexpected runaway success after its launch in 2005 and has now had more than 50million views.

He's even been featured on Have I Got News For You and The Late Show with David Letterman.

And his dreams have finally become reality, as he's been approached by casting agents to play soon-to-be murdered characters.

Chuck's film and TV credits now number 25 and his acting talent even won him a role in the Kate Beckinsale horror film Vacancy.

But
 his biggest break so far has been in a budget slasher flick that spent 
months at the top of the Netflix most-watched horror list and has become
 a cult hit in the States.

In
 2009’s Thankskilling - the story of a demonic turkey that kills 
students - Chuck got a speaking part for the first time and an 
adaptation has just been released as a musical on New York's Broadway.

Mr Lamb told MailOnline that he's enjoyed the fame playing dead people has brought him.

He
 said: 'One of my favorite moments as a dead guy was being asked to 
attend an autograph show and realizing people actually would want my 
autograph.

'At the same 
place I also got to meet some of favorite actors - Mickey Rooney, Debbie
 Reynolds and so on. On set one of my favorite moments was in 
Thankskilling. I had to wear a turkey costume and the crew put a rubber 
snake in it then filmed me when I found it. Needless to say, it scared 
the heck out of me.'

Despite his Hollywood star turn and brushes with fame on the set of American TV series, Mr Lamb's greatest aspiration lies in the UK - he's desperate to go on Celebrity Big Brother

Honest: Mr Lamb says that he's 'the big hunk of meat that lies around ¿getting slaughtered¿

Mr Lamb lists several reasons as to why he makes a good corpse, with one of them being that he's bald, which means that any wig fits him, he explains

1. I have fair skin. Ever see a corpse with a good tan?

2. I am bald. Any wig will fit me.

3. I have no tattoos. So people can't say: 'I know that guy.'

4. I am not a star. No need for salary negotiations.

5. It will be great publicity. You're helping a guy live his dream.

6. I have many friends. More people will see the movie.

7. I can play many different dead people - cowboy, mafia, gang, business man.

8. I am average size: 6ft 0in and 220lbs.

9. I have no freckles, warts or ugly things on my body.

10. No hair on my back. No one wants to see that! Even on a dead body.

Mr Lamb
 has also appeared on TV show The Jury and movies Horrorween, Kentucky 
Fried Horror and funeral home comedy Stiffs – credited simply as ‘Dead 
Body Guy’.

Despite his 
Hollywood star turn and brushes with fame on the set of American TV 
series, Chuck's greatest aspiration lies in the UK: he's desperate to go
 on Celebrity Big Brother!

Mr Lamb said: ‘It started as a joke, we live in the mid-west and there aren't many film opportunities

‘I just thought: wouldn't it be cool to be on TV? How could we do that being nobodies?

‘I had a dream that I was the dead body on Law & Order. I woke up and realised: you don't need any talent to play dead!

‘So Tonya made up fake blood and started photographing the poses.

‘She's the brains behind it, I'm just the big hunk of meat that lies around “getting slaughtered”.

‘What other wife gets to think of ways to kill her husband more than once a week?!

‘But it's all hug and make-up once we've finished the shoot. It's so much fun it brings us closer together.

‘I'm still waiting to get the call from Law & Order SVU though!

‘I adore Celebrity Big Brother - it's amazing. I'd love to be in that house. Or the Waking Dead - man I'd love to be a zombie.

‘After this started rolling I realised it was hard work being an actor in a movie - it takes so long.

‘To do a seven second scene took eight hours and I've been left waiting for in all sorts of places.

‘Once I was laid him in a pile of fire ants by an accident but I didn't want to be a pain in the butt so I just stuck it out.

Mr Lamb's talents have led to appearances on Have I Got News For You and The Late Show with David Letterman

Star turn: Chuck Lamb on camera as a corpse

‘Like any great actor, I've really suffered for my art!

‘I
 look like a dead body. If you're going to get somebody to play dead you
 might as well get the palest most normal looking guy you can find.

‘No-one's ever going to call me and ask me to be the leading man heart throb so I thought I'd put what God gave me to good use.

‘I thought outside the box by putting myself in the box.’
