The Tennessean reports that Murray didn't see exactly what happened, and could only say that Chilly Bear had been knocked down by the time help arrived.

Knoxville Police Department Sgt. Jason Keck said no one has yet been arrested in the assault. 

Chilly Bear had to have a brief stay in the emergency room but assured his fans on Facebook he was on the mend.

Chilly wrote he was 'really sore and still having some nausea from the concussion. I sure will miss everyone for the next couple games, but look forward to being back out there with all of you!! I appreciate everyone's thoughts and prayers, as it really does mean alot to me!!'

Chilly Bear said that police were on the case.

'Murray said there were around 4,000 fans at Friday night's game and he believed Knoxville Police were working to talk with fans to figure out what exactly happened,' he wrote.
