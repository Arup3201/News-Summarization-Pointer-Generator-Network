There are music fans, and then there are number one music fans.

And Londoners Theo Coyne, 28, and his new wife Lisa Potter-Coyne, 29, are most certainly the latter when it comes to R'n'B singer Craig David.

The pair are so besotted with the British star that they launched a Twitter campaign and created a spoof YouTube video inviting him to their wedding.

And they were then stunned (as were their guests and their neighbours) when the singer jetted some 1,500 miles to turn up at their Cambridgeshire countryside reception and perform.

The couple's hilarious 
four-minute YouTube clip - which shows Theo rapping about their obsession
with Craig David's music - went viral before it was eventually spotted 
by the singer.

David, 31, touched by the admission that Theo and Lisa had been to over 25 of his concerts and that his music had actually brought them closer, took up the offer.

He was also moved to discover that Theo had raised both his younger brothers when their parents died young of cancer.

The singer flew from Los Angeles to Lisa's parents' 
home in rural Cambridgeshire, and performed an hour-long set in the back 
garden.

The 'down-to-earth' star joined in the party, mingling with the couple's guests and signed hundreds of autographs.

An anonymous wedding guest said: 'Craig was absolutely amazing. He
was so down-to-earth that we almost forgot he was a celebrity. He 
mingled with guest, he hugged people, and he signed so many things - not 
only for Theo and Lisa but also lots of guests. It was a pinch-yourself moment.

'Craig
then performed an hour's set in the back garden - again, a really 
surreal moment. Everybody knew all the words to all his songs so the 
atmosphere was just incredible. It really was a dream come true for Theo
and Lisa.'

New bride Lisa tweeted the day after the wedding, saying: 'Craig!! Thank u! U are the man! You'll never understand what u being here meant to us. Absolute hero. Mrs.Coyne ;)'

And Theo wrote: 'Only right to listen to my boy @CraigDavid for journey home from wedding.'

Theo and Lisa had launched a Twitter 
campaign in the year leading up to their wedding and published the video
online on Youtube in May this year.

The
couple could not believe it when Craig David's management called to say
the singer would make every effort to attend their wedding.

Theo
and Lisa got married at Ely Register Office on Friday and were joined 
by hundreds of their friends and family for the reception on Saturday.

The Born To Do It singer stayed true to his word and arrived at the reception at Lisa's father and step-mother's home in The Warren in Witchford, Cambs., at 9pm.

Craig wrote on Instagram on Sunday: 'Had the most amazing experience last night surprising Theo & Lisa at their wedding celebrations!

'Seeing them so happy having me attend & hearing me sing was as emotional for me as it was for them!

'They told me how they have been fans of my music from the start of my career, have bought all of my songs, been to over 25 of my concerts and that my music had brought them closer together over the eight years that they have been partners.

'Theo is a great guy and has found a beautiful wife in Lisa....he also has all my respect raising his younger brothers when both his parents died of cancer within months of each other while he was still only a child himself.

'I was so happy to be at their wedding celebrations with their friends and family. They told me it was a dream come true for them..... & for me no money or material item could give me this much happiness & so much happiness for them at the same time! Wow!'

Craig David was so touched by Theo and Lucy's YouTube tribute that he flew 1,500 miles to perform for free at their wedding

Neighbours in the countryside village were shocked to hear Craig David singing at a house on their quiet street.

One said: 'We knew the wedding reception was being held and then all of a sudden we heard singing.

'I thought, "Crikey, that's a Craig David song, and that doesn't half sound like him singing it", only to realise he was actually next door.

'I can’t believe Craig David was in Witchford - what an amazing moment for the couple.'
