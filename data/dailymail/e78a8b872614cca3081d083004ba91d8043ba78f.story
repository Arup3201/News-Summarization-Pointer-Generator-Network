Silvio Berlusconi paid underage exotic dancer Ruby-the-Heart-stealer five million Euros to commit perjury at his sex trial, prosecutors believe.

The former Italian premier was last year convicted of paying for sex with Ruby, real name Karima el Mahroug when she was just 17, during notorious burlesque orgies at his mansion. It is illegal to have sex with a prostitute under the age of 18 in Italy.

An entire troupe of ‘bunga bunga’ girls are also accused of perjury in the Milan prosecutor’s probe into an alleged attempt to pervert the course of justice during the trial.

Underage sex: Silvio Berlusconi was convicted of paying for sex with Ruby, real name Karima el Mahroug when she was just 17, at trial last year

In court seven of the showgirls and starlets admitted receiving a salary of €2,500 a month, but prosecutors now believe as many as 30 received payments.

Some were also living rent-free in apartments on Berlusconi’s vast property development adjacent to Milan, Milan 2.

Berlusconi has always said that he maintained them because ‘their lives were ruined by the trial’.

Forty five people are named in the prosecutor's investigation into judicial corruption, including Berlusconi’s two lawyers, an aged pop star and a journalist on Berlusconi's Mediaset channels, who allegedly received payments totalling €800,000 from the former premier, as well as several cars.

Giorgia Iafrate, the policewoman who authorised Ruby’s release from jail, because Berlusconi claimed she was the niece of former Egyptian despot Hosni Mubarak, is also named in the writ.

A Milan-based group of bunga bunga girls were allegedly summoned to Berlusconi’s mansion on the night of January 15, 2011 to finalise the defensive strategy.

‘Ruby in particular was promised a huge reward if she kept quiet and if not Berlusconi would go ballistic, judicial sources told Italian newspaper Corriere della Sera.

The former nightclub dancer later told a friend that she was expecting €5million from Berlusconi, police phone taps have revealed.

Prosecutor Edmondo Bruti Liberati of the Court of Milan confirmed the probe and said that his investigations were ongoing.

Berlusconi denies the allegations and vowed today to remain in politics ‘until the end.’ He said: 'I feel the responsibility of the trust given to me and of the votes of the public.

'I will stay in the field, more convinced than ever that I have to fight till the end to see what I deeply believe in prevail.'

The media mogul is currently appealing his seven year sentence in the Ruby trial and faces a court ruling in April on his one year sentence for tax fraud.

Berlusconi has applied to serve his sentence performing community service but could ace house arrest which would hinder his party’s chances in the May European elections.
