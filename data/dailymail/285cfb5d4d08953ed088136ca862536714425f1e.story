Portugal may have 'one of the best players in the history of football' in the form of Cristiano Ronaldo but Branislav Ivanovic is confident his Serbia side can nullify the threat of the Real Madrid star on Sunday night. 

Serbia currently occupy fourth place in the Group I standings ahead of their clash with Portugal who sit just one point behind pool leaders Denmark. 

'You're speaking about one of the best players in the history of football, he's not so easy,' Ivanovic told Perform.

'To be on the top level you have to prove yourself every day, he's doing that game by game.

'He is the guy who knows how to deal with the pressure, for us it will be a big challenge and I hope and I know we have the quality to try to deal with that.'

Ivanovic's side were deducted three points following their 3-0 win against Albania in October when an unmanned drone carrying a pro-Albania flag flew over the Partizan Stadium in Belgrade and resulted in a melee between the two sets of players and some Serbian fans. 

A 3-1 loss to Denmark in November has heaped further pressure on Serbia and Ivanovic concedes that Sunday's game is a must-win game for his side.

'It is a crucial game for us, this qualification especially, because we expect to have more points in the three games, so the game against Portugal is crucial and massive for us,' the Chelsea defender added.

'We know Portugal is favourite and are a great team but they've lost a game at home against Albania, so we see our chances and we know if we perform well - if we play to the level we know how to play - we can expect some presents and gifts from the game.'
