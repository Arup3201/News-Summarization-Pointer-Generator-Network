The UK Independence Party’s dramatic wins of more than 140 seats revealed a colourful new band of councillors across the country.

They include a descendent of Guy Fawkes, a mother and two daughters and a candidate who did no campaigning at all.

But none of the candidates who caused the party embarrassment with claims of Nazi salutes, pictures with Hitler and Holocaust denial were successful at the ballot box.

UKIP leader Nigel Farage today insisted that only a ‘handful caused us embarrassment’ but vowed to toughen up checks for wannabe politicians.

But he expressed delight at the number of members elected to county councils across the country.

He said: ''We have been abused by everybody, the entire establishment, and now they are shocked and stunned that we are getting over 25 per cent of the vote everywhere we stand across the country. This is a real sea-change in British politics.'

UKIP became the second largest party in Lincolnshire, winning 16 seats and depriving Conservatives of overall control.

Among the UKIP winners in Lincolnshire  were a mother and two daughters.

Sue Ransome, 61, and her daughters Felicity and Elizabeth Ransome, 27 and 26, gained three seats in elections in Boston.

The mother of four took the Boston East seat with 675 votes while Felicity took Boston Coastal with 826 votes and Elizabeth took Boston Fishtoft with 837 votes.

Mrs Ransome said: 'I can't quite believe it. We're used to coming second, third, but never first. It's great, a dream come true.'

Her husband Ron stood for Boston South, along with their daughter Jodie Sutton, 36, in Boston Rural - both came second.

Mr Ransome added: 'Our time has come - I'm used to always being the bridesmaid - but at least I've got a few brides with me now.'

Surprise win: Ian Smith celebrates winning a seat on Dorset County Council, despite not campaigning or even turning up to the count. He didn't even own a UKIP rosette

Winners: In Essex UKIP won nine seats on the county council, including three wards in the Basildon and Wickford districts taken by (left to right) Mark Ellis, Kerry Smith and Nigel Le Gresley

In Dorset, Ian Smith became UKIP's first ever councillor despite not campaigning or even turning up to the count.

His name did not appear on any leaflets, he does not own a UKIP rosette and only agreed to stand three weeks ago.

He only found out he had been elected by email this morning. 'My initial reaction was "my goodness!" I was shocked but I'm very happy,' he said as he posed for pictures cracking open champagne.

A distant relation of Guy Fawkes was among the UKIP winners. Retired headteacher Philip Fawkes and the would-be bomber shared a common ancestor in the Gunpowder Plotter's 15th century great-great-grandfather.

Mr Farage said it showed 'the blood of rebellion still runs in his veins'.

Mr Fawkes won the South Waterside ward in Hampshire County Council, defeating Tory Alexis McEvoy, who pinned the blame on the Prime Minister.

'Clearly the message was to the government. I hope the government will listen because they never do,' she told the BBC.

'They are arrogant, out of touch and because of them good councillors have now been lost.'

The father of Tory MP Priti Patel who stood for UKIP failed to win in Hertfordshire.

Sushil Kantibhai Patel came second, more than 1,200 votes behind Conservatives but ahead of Labour and Liberal Democrats.

UKIP candidate Dave Watson, who spent polling day 6,000 miles from polling stations in Thailand, failed in his bid to win a seat on Hampshire County Council.

He had insisted he could do the job by dividing his time between the two countries.

The 51-year-old local businessman flew to Asia a week ago. He wrote on Facebook that he could be there for six months, enjoying the ‘sea views’.

Speaking from Thailand last night, he told MailOnline: ‘ I am here because my wife and I have had issues. It is a family crisis.’
