Four people from Williams had to be treated for smoke inhalation on Friday after a fire broke out at one of the team hotels being used for this weekend's German Grand Prix.

The fire, at the Hotel Mondial in Wiesloch situated eight miles from Hockenheim, started at 3am, resulting in an immediate evacuation of the building.

Fortunately no one was hurt, with only a quartet of team members taken to a local hospital due to the effects of the smoke, but they were soon discharged.

Lucky escape: Four Williams team members were treated for smoke inhalation after a hotel fire

Boy from Brazil: Williams No 1 driver Felipe Massa was not involved in the fire as he was staying elsewhere

Neither the drivers, Felipe Massa and Valtteri Bottas, nor any of the team management were involved as they were staying at another hotel, similarly with the marketing department.

It is the second fire Williams have been involved in in just over two years as the team garage went up in flames at Barcelona's Circuit de Catalunya following Pastor Maldonado's Spanish Grand Prix win in May 2012.

Meanwhile, Williams driver Massa is fully aware he personally needs to improve,, although it is fair to say he has sustained his fair share of 
bad luck.

In
 his maiden year with the Grove-based marque following his arrival from 
Ferrari, Massa currently trails team-mate Valtteri Bottas by 43 points.

Along
 the way there have been numerous disappointments, including crashes not
 of his own making in Canada and in Britain of late when high finishes 
were on the cards given the current strength of his car.

Speed demon: Williams driver Massa takes part in practice ahead of the German Grand Prix

Massa has 
no doubts his form and fortune will turn around, adding: 'It was 
obviously not a great race at Silverstone given the things that 
happened.

'That
 includes qualifying and the start when I had a problem with my clutch, 
and then of course there was the accident with Kimi (Raikkonen).

'So many things happened which cost me a lot of points because the car was amazing, it was so competitive.

'I'm
 still convinced and very motivated everything will become normal and 
I'll have a good car that will score a lot of points and I can fight 
with the big teams until the end of the championship.

'I really believe this is possible, and that's the way I'm working.'
