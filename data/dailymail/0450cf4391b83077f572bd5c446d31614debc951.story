A chance meeting at a railway station led to blossoming romance in the classic film Brief Encounter.

Just like the film's characters Laura and Alec, Thomas and Ethel Bramwell locked eyes for the first time on a railway platform, when Thomas helped Ethel and her friend from their train in Openshaw.

But the similarities with the film end there, as these real-life wartime sweethearts did live happily ever after, and recently celebrated their 70th wedding anniversary.

Brief encounter: Thomas and Ethel's eyes first met at a railway station in Openshaw in 1942

Happily ever after: The wartime sweethearts, seen on their wedding day in 1943, have celebrated their 70th wedding anniversary

The Bramwells, now both 89, were teenagers when they first met at Ashburys Railway Station in Openshaw.

Railway 
worker Thomas helped Ethel and a friend from the train onto the station 
platform before fate threw them together again the following evening at 
the nearby Grey Mare Hotel.

Thomas, who lives with his wife on Alfred Street, Bury, said: 'I worked there part-time as a waiter, but it was her friend who fancied me and she'd brought Ethel along.

'I had other ideas and managed to get Ethel on her own for a moment and I asked her to go dancing with me in town the following night. It was the best decision I ever made.'

The couple, who both hail from east Manchester, were married less than a year later on February 27, 1943, at St Cross Church in Clayton. Within weeks of their wedding, Thomas was called up to serve with the Royal Armoured Corps in North Africa and Italy during the Second World War.

His military service caused him to miss the birth of his eldest son Geoffrey, who he saw for the first time as a two-year-old when he returned home in 1946. Younger son David followed three years later.

Thomas and Ethel then both worked at the Clayton Aniline Company - he as an engineer and her in the dyestuffs lab - until they retired after more than 30 years.

The proud couple welcomed more than 50 guests, including their three grandchildren and 10 great-grandchildren at a 70th wedding anniversary celebration at the Red Hall Hotel in Bury.

The Bramwells admit they could never have dreamed of reaching such a momentous milestone when they wed.

Thomas said: 'When we met we were in the middle of the war and you lived each minute to the next as you never knew when your time would be up.

'We've got so many happy memories - but over 70 years it's not always going to be a bed of roses and you've got to learn how to handle the bad times so you can enjoy the good ones.'

His wife said: 'It was funny how we met. I only went to the hotel to accompany my friend, but I think some things are just meant to be. It's hard to believe it's been so many years, but we can honestly say we've got no regrets which is a very nice feeling.'
