Fernando Alonso paid an unexpected visit to McLaren’s factory in Woking on Monday as he prepares for his potential return in the Malaysian Grand Prix a week on Sunday.

The double world champion, who was concussed in an unexplained testing accident in Barcelona last month, spoke to senior engineers during his trip.

‘He seemed in good spirits and is confident he can race in Kuala Lumpur,’ said a source within the factory. Alonso also talked through the data from the accident.

The 33-year-old will return to the factory – officially called the McLaren Technology Centre – this week to drive the simulator, probably on Thursday. 

A spokesman for the team confirmed to Sportsmail that he would spend a day on the high-tech machine, which would be set to replicate the Sepang circuit in Malaysia. It is the usual procedure for their drivers to go in the simulator before any race.

However, Alonso must be cleared by the FIA’s doctors before he can get in the car again. A date for those tests has yet to be set, though they could take place in the paddock a week on Thursday.

The Spaniard spent three days in hospital after the accident and returned for further scans, but was not allowed to take part in the opening race of the season in Australia last Sunday. His place was taken by Kevin Magnussen, whose car gave up on him before the lights went out.

Alonso, who is paid £27million a year, has returned to the gym to get ready for his return. Driving the simulator will allow him to restore his confidence after the discombobulating crash.

His return would boost McLaren, who were last of the finishers at the weekend through Jenson Button – an even worse team display than they were expecting.
