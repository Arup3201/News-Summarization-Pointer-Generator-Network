An 81-year-old great-grandmother from Maryland has been placed behind bars for a minor pet violation committed almost a year ago.

Last May, a neighbor snapped pictures of Mary Magdalene Root's small dogs running down the street and she was reported to Animal Control.

It landed her with a $7,000 fine or up to a year in jail.

Arrested: An 81-year-old great-grandmother, Mary Magdalene Root, was placed behind bars for a minor pet violation committed nearly a year ago. The Maryland woman says she tried paying thousands of dollars in fines but couldn¿t afford them

Mary Magdalene Root, 81, who lives near Havre de Grace, was jailed on $2,500 bail on seven counts of allegedly letting her dogs run at-large a year ago

The dogs ran out of her home last year and she gave chase but it was to no avail

The Harford County woman says she tried paying thousands of dollars in fines but couldn’t afford them.

'I’ve never had a crime. Never. Not even a traffic ticket,' Ms Root told CBS Baltimore.

'I’m struggling to pay my house taxes. I couldn’t pay it. It’s a different thing when you leave your dogs out and you don’t care. But I do care,' Root said.

She failed to show up at court to argue her case under doctors orders.

Root is charged with failing to pay seven $75 civil citations for three incidents on Feb. 13, 2013, March 1, 2013 and March 10, 2013 in which her dogs ¿ a tan terrier mix and a black and tan Chihuahua ¿ were loose near her home, according to charging documents

Root has lived in Maryland her entire life and at her current residence on Oak Drive for 40 years. She also has no prior convitions

According to court records, the county issued a warrant for Root's arrest on February 12th after she failed to appear for a court hearing last November to address the civil citations.

Upon finding out about that she was a wanted woman,

she was admitted to Harford Memorial Hospital on Valentine's Day.

It was then a judge had her arrested. She was booked, fingerprinted and made to wear a jumpsuit like any other prisoner.

Despite her being an elderly woman with no prior convictions, as well as being a cancer survivor, a judge refused to let her go until she had paid a $2,500 fine.

After paying the bond she was ordered barred from keeping animals on her property.

Root says she was taking care of her daughter’s four dogs at the time of her arrest.

The dogs, a tan terrier mix and a black and tan Chihu, were on the loose near her home.

'I feel like I’m a criminal, but yet I don’t feel like I’ve done anything,' Root said

Incredibly, a stranger and Good Samaritan ended up paying her bond.

Mary Magdalene Root¿s small dogs are her constant companions. So much so that the 81-year-old widow spent two nights in the Harford County Detention Center fighting to keep them

Root¿s defense attorneys asked the judge to let the senior citizen go. She had no previous criminal history and she was in failing health. The judge said no

'There are very nice people out there. But then there are some people who are so struck on the strictness of the law. I don’t know whether maybe that needs to be looked at,' Root said.

She has been told that she is unable to return to her home of 44 years and live with the dogs, but she says she can't simply get rid of them.

She is now living with her daughter, but the dogs have been taken away, and Ms. Root is now a broken woman.

'I love them,' she said. 'I was planning on coming down on the dogs. But my dogs, they keep my company and I love them.'

The judge ordered her to pay a $2,500 bail. And if she was able to pay it and get out, then no animals would be allowed back on her property

the 81-year-old cancer survivor receive the convictions more than a year ago but never bothered to pay the fines

Her daughter told the Baltimore Sun that her mother is just an animal lover who has owned several animals including dogs, an iguana and snakes over the years.

'She's very passionate about her animals,' Vantina Gifford, 52, said following the hearing. 'They do get out, but they don't hurt anybody. They have never attacked, never bitten, tore up property or defecated on anyone's property.'

Ms Root says she has received a lot of support from the community and there is now a petition asking lawmakers to show leniency when they involve senior citizens.

“I don’t know if I’ll ever be the same. I can’t pull myself back,' Root said.

According to Root's daughter, her mother is just an animal lover. She said her mom has owned several animals including dogs, an iguana and snakes over the years

Ms. Root says that without her dogs she does know now what she is going to do. She is a broken woman
