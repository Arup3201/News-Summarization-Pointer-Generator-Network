As Sunni extremists claimed the lives of more than a dozen policemen near Iraq's border with Syria and airstrikes struck targets near Aleppo, dozens of locals lined up to compete in what must be the most dangerous running race in the world.

The men yesterday raced through the war-torn streets in Aleppo's rebel-controlled Bustan al-Qasr neighbourhood. 

Little is known about the race, which was eventually won by Ahmed Sobhe. He later posed for photographs while holding a trophy aloft.

Dozens of men took to the war-torn streets of Aleppo yesterday and competed in a running race

The race came as an attack on a police checkpoint near the Syrian border town of al-Walid claimed the lives of 15 Iraqi policemen in an assault that underscored the depth of the country's turmoil

The race came as an attack on a police checkpoint  near the Syrian border town of al-Walid claimed the lives of 15 Iraqi policemen in an assault that underscored the depth of the country's turmoil.

It also followed an announcement on Monday from Iraq's prime minister, Haider al-Abadi, that he had retired 24 officials from the interior Ministry.

The move is part of efforts to restructure the country's security apparatus and remove those who failed to confront the crisis caused by the Islamic State group's onslaught, he said.

In Syria, the U.S. Central Command said a U.S. airstrike struck a target associated with the so-called Khorasan group, which it says is a special cell within the al-Qaida-linked Nusra Front that is plotting attacks against Western interests. 

The attack took place near Aleppo, and was among 27 airstrikes since Friday that mainly targeted Islamic State group militants in Kobani and Raqqa in northern Syria.

The strike on the Khorasan group marked the fifth time the U.S. has targeted Nusra, al-Qaida's Syria branch, as part of its broader campaign against the ISIS group in Syria and Iraq.

The June fall of Iraq's second-largest city, Mosul, was a turning point in the war against the jihadi group that calls itself the Islamic State. The U.S.-trained Iraqi military, harassed for months by small-scale attacks, buckled almost instantly when militants advanced on the city. Commanders disappeared, pleas for more ammunition went unanswered and in some cases, soldiers stripped off their uniforms and ran from the fight.

Since then, U.S.-led coalition airstrikes have served to reinforce Iraqi and Kurdish security forces as they battle the Sunni militants, but major victories have been sparse. 

At least five other officers were injured during the checkpoint attack on Monday.   

Also Monday, the U.N. Assistance Mission for Iraq said that 1,232 Iraqis were killed and 2,434 were wounded in violence and terror attacks in November. Of those killed, at least 296 were members of Iraqi and Kurdish forces, as well as militias who fight alongside the troops.
