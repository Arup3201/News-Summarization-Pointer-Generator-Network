At least 59 people have been killed in rare sectarian bombings on civilians in Afghanistan.

The two blasts, targeted at Shiite worshippers, occurred during a festival known as Ashoura, and were the first major sectarian attacks for a decade.

In the more deadly of the two, a suicide bomber struck in the middle of a crowd outside a mosque in the capital Kabul.

The group had gathered at the Abul  Fazl shrine to commemorate the seventh century death of the Prophet Mohammed’s grandson.

The bomber detonated his explosives near one of the gates to the shrine, killing 55, including two women and four children.More than 160 people were wounded.

It was the deadliest attack since a suicide bomber killed 60 people near the Indian embassy in the city in 2008.

At roughly the same time, 185 miles away in the northern city of Mazar-i-Sharif, four people were killed when a bomb strapped to a bicycle exploded as a convoy of Shiites drove down a road.

No group has claimed responsibility for the attacks, which have been condemned by the Taliban. Suspicion centered on militant groups based in Pakistan where Sunni attacks on minority Shiites are common.

A man claiming to be from Lashkar-e-Jhangvi, a Pakistan-based militant group that has carried out attacks against Shiites, called media outlets to claim responsibility for the Kabul bombing but his claim has not been confirmed.

Witness Mahood Khan, who is in charge of the Abul Fazl shrine, said: ‘It was a very powerful blast. It was out of control. Everyone was crying, shouting. It is a disaster.’

Among the victims the body of a woman, clutching a dead child in each arm, was sprawled along a dirt road littered with shoes and bloodstained clothing, while survivors with blood-smeared faces screamed  for help.

Religiously motivated attacks on minority Shiite Muslims, who make up about 20 per cent of the country’s 30 million people, are rare in Afghanistan.

The country’s Ministry of Interior blamed the Taliban and ‘terrorists’ for the blasts.

President Hamid Karzai said the Kabul attack was unprecedented.

He said it was ‘the first time that on such an important religious day in Afghanistan terrorism of that horrible nature is  taking place.
