Our ancestor? The remains of two early humans dating back 7,000 years has proved that English people originally came from Spain

The remains of two early humans dating back 7,000 years has proved that English people originally came from Spain.

The remains - found in a cave in Cantabria - included a near-complete skeleton.

The prehistoric genetic fragments date back 7,000 years -
1,700 years before Otzi, the Iceman whose mummy was discovered in the Alps.

They are believed to be from an ancient population that continued to move northwards into territories such as England, Germany, Lithuania and Poland.'

They come from two individuals who lived in what is now
Valdelugueros near Leon and share the same characteristics as that of people
from England and other parts of northern Europe.

Evolutionary biologist Dr Carles Lauleza-Fox, of the Spanish
National Research Council, said: ‘These hunters-gatherers shared nomadic habits
and had a common origin.

‘Despite their geographical distance, individuals from the
regions corresponding to the current England, Germany, Lithuania, Poland, and
Spain, shared the same mitochondrial lineage.’

The site where the remains were found was only discovered in
2006 by chance.

The cave is in a cold and mountainous area which is why the DNA
was preserved.

But it is believed they continued to move northwards meaning
that today’s Spaniards do not have the same lineage.

Bones belonging to them were found in the Brana-Arintero cave in
Cantabria. They included one skeleton that was almost complete.

The study published in Current Biology also shows modern day
Iberian populations do not come from the pair.

Dr Lauleza-Fox and colleagues managed to decipher from one the
complete mitochondrial DNA, which is passed down the maternal line, revealed
Europeans from this time were very uniform genetically.

The overall DNA data represents 1.34 and 0.5 percent of both
individuals’ total genome, and found Iberians from then were more closely related
to northern Europeans who may have assimilated part of their genetic legacy.

The mummy of Otzi belonged to a man who lived 5,300 years ago,
a period known geologically as the Neolithic, and was found in the Tyrolean
Alps, on the border of Austria and Italy.

Dr Lalueza-Fox said the team eventually hopes to recover the
complete DNA of the individuals, and to compare it with that of modern humans.

He said: ‘The arrival of the Neolithic Period brought about a
replacement of populations, and could cause genetic changes in genes associated
with new infectious diseases, and in metabolic genes linked to changes in diet.
Therefore, all the information extracted from this genome will be absolutely
important.’
