Discount supermarket Aldi is taking on upmarket rival Waitrose by stocking Lobster for the first time.

Over the past year Aldi has become the darling of the recession-hit middle classes attracting an extra one million, mainly affluent, shoppers who have helped to double profits, latest accounts released today show.

Such rapid growth has forced the privately owned German supermarket to triple staff in every store and increase the number of checkouts.

Upmarket: The supermarket has courted a recession-hit middle class in recent months

Its growing army of middle class shoppers are behind soaring sales which have jumped 40 per cent to £3.8billion after it won a host of awards including Grocer Of The Year and Supermarket Of The Year. Profits grew to £157.9million from £70.5million.  

Now bosses say the shift upmarket means it is having to upgrade its selection of mainly own brand produce for its new well-heeled clientele.

Christmas will see entire legs of 6.5kg Serrano ham selling for £49.99, a fraction of the £407 price tag at some exclusive outlets.

Lobster Tails weighing 240g will sell for £9.99 while a fresh three-bird roast, featuring duck, turkey breast and wild pheasant with pork & orange stuffing is also part of the festive selection for the first time.

The slogan 'spend a little, live a lot' is being reaped for all it is worth with cut-price versions of luxurious food

Joint managing director Matthew Barnes said Aldi is appealing to more people despite some customers preferring to keep it a secret: ‘We are continuing to open stores right across the country, attracting more people and a broader demographic to Aldi.

‘We have opened in affluent locations like Knutsford and Winchester and have been able to evolve in a direction that is more attractive to a wider group of people.’

Aldi has also opened new stores in upmarket Leamington Spa, Stratford-upon-Avon, Beverly, Nantwich, Didsbury and Cowes on the Isle of Wight.

Shoppers have taken to its own brands which cost a fraction of the price of the popular household names but still win awards for quality.

Its own-brand Champagne, Gin and Prosecco have all won awards, while many of its wines have been hailed by critics.

The supermarket has made a huge effort to attract the middle classes, introducing a range of superior products at budget prices including olive oils, spirits, wine, coffee, and Aberdeen Angus steaks.

Lobster and ham are new additions to its list of luxury.

But some shoppers will still feel the need to visit some of the more mainstream grocers to stock up on the brands they know and love.

When Aldi opened its first store in Knutsford in June, 300 well-heeled locals queued from 3am having parked Aston Martins, Jaguars and Range Rovers in the car park.

It along with rival Lidl, and upmarket grocer Waitrose have polarised the grocery market all growing faster that the more mainstream grocers as shoppers flock to either low cost or premium supermarkets.

On Wednesday Tesco is due to show how its £1billion turnaround plan is progressing when it posts its half year figures.

Days later it is also set to unveil a revamp of its premium Finest range as it lock horns with Waitrose for the posh pound.

By contrast rival Sainsbury’s is also set to unveil its second quarter trading update on Wednesday.

The latest industry dates compiled by Nielsen for the twelve-week period ending August 17th 2013 shows Aldi’s growth has continued into 2013, with its average basket spend now £18.63, while an average basket size of 16-17 products is almost on a par with Morrisons and Sainsbury’s, which stock more product lines.

Recent Kantar data shows the discount grocer recording a 32.7pc increase in underlying sales and maintaining its all-time record market share of 3.7pc.
