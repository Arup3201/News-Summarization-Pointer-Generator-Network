Gwyneth Paltrow and Chris Martin have jetted to country music megastars Faith Hill and Tim McGraw's private island in the Bahamas for some alone time, MailOnline can reveal.

Continuing what is being billed as the 'most romantic divorce ever', the couple, who announced the end of their 10-year marriage last week, headed for the exclusive hideaway of Goat Cay on Sunday morning.

Oscar winner Gwyneth, 41, and Coldplay frontman Chris, 37, boarded a private plane from Eleuthera with their children Apple, nine and Moses, seven,and flew off to the island.

The pair are great friends with country power couple Faith and her husband Tim - and Gwyneth starred with Tim in 2011 movie Country Strong, in which the singer played the blonde star's husband.

Retreat: Country music megastars Faith Hill and Tim McGraw bought Goat Cay in 2008

Chris, who married Gwyneth in Mexico in
2003, was seen driving a Red Ford Explorer to the Bahaman Governor’s 
Harbor Airport so the family could make the trip to Goat Cay - a 17-acre
 tropical utopia owned by their friends.

Faith and Tim, both 46, bought the 
island in 2008. And their paradise features a 15,000-square-foot, four-bedroom house that comes complete with a 
lookout tower, as well as three smaller houses for their staff.

The
 exclusive Exuma archipelago is made up of 365 islands costing around 
$30 million each and privately-owned by stars ranging from Johnny Depp 
to David Copperfield and Tyler Perry.

'They
 looked happy and calm,' said a witness who saw Chris and Gwyneth and their children boarding the plane en route to the A-List holiday 
destination.

'Chris was wearing a hat and Gwyneth was casual 
in a white t-shirt…they drove right up to their private jet with the 
kids in tow.'

The plane took off around 9.50am and reportedly landed in Cave Cay - a private islet where no commercial aircraft are permitted.

They
 were greeted by an entourage of staff before boarding a private boat 
whisking them to a smaller island loaned to them by the super-rich 
“Nashville Sweethearts”.

The families are so close that Gwyneth even said that she hoped her young son would grow up to marry Faith and Tim's daughter Audrey.

When interviewed by Faith for the January 2011 issue of In Style, she said: 'Moses … we might really become family when he marries Audrey! My son is in love with your daughter!'

'Don't you just love our babies?' Faith asked her friend, who replied: 'I love mine, and I love yours!'

Husband and wife: Gwyneth Paltrow grew close with Tim McGraw as played a couple in 2011 movie Country Strong. She bonded with his wife, singer Faith Hill, revealing she based a lot of her character on the star

And Gwyneth made it clear that she leaned on Faith while filming in Nashville for the movie, where she played a country movie star battling alcoholism, saying: 'When I was researching the role, I went back and watched all of [Faith's] DVDs and videos and her performances.'

Faith added: 'She’s amazing. I have fallen in love with this person,' and the close friends were pictured enjoying a sushi lunch in Manhattan - while last March, Chris was seen strolling the streets near his North London home with his kids, Faith and her daughters Gracie Katherine, 16, Maggie Elizabeth, 15, and Audrey Caroline, 12, ahead of Tim's London gig.

Worth
 an estimated $145 million combined Tim and Faith have dominated the 
charts with tender duets such as "Let's Make Love" and "It's Your Love."

Publicly
 vowing to 'never to spend more than three consecutive days apart' they 
have been married for 18 years - and last November were forced to deny rumours they were 
divorcing.

And
 despite the fact that sources tell MailOnline, Gwyneth and Chris WILL 
divorce - planning their best for an amicable legal split - they have 
showed a display of unity by going on vacation together as they 
announced they were 'conscious uncoupling'.

Gwyneth had already removed her wedding ring as the couple
 dined together in an intense show of public affection while reportedly 
staying in a luxury a $10,500-per week mansion on the Bahaman island of 
Eleuthera.

'Chris was making Gwyneth laugh until she had to wipe tears from her eyes,” said a witness in the restaurant.

'You wouldn’t believe they were divorcing. They were deep in conversation and looked really happy together.'

After
 relaxing in the opulent villa, a few doors down from Mariah Carey’s 
compound, the family left for the next leg of their Caribbean tour.

Gwyneth announced her split from Martin last Tuesday, via her healthy-living site Goop.com which promptly crashed due to the overwhelming traffic, saying: It is with hearts full of sadness that we have decided to separate.'

In their emotional, somewhat bizarrely entitled, statement called 'Conscious Uncoupling', Gwyneth, and Chris admitted they had spent more than a year battling to save their marriage.

Vowing to co-parent their children, they said: 'We have been working hard for well over a year, some of it together, some of it separated, to see what might have been possible between us, and we have come to the conclusion that while we love each other very much we will remain separate.'
