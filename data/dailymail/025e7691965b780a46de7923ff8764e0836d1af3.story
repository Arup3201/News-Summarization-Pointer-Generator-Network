A young boy with stunning good looks has become Britain's first Romeo Beckham lookalike.

Evan Taws, 11, has signed to a professional lookalike agency after he was constantly told by family and friends how much he looked like Victoria and David's eldest son.

Mother Claire, from Blythe, Northumberland, started looking through pictures and matching up hairstyles of Evan's with those of Romeo - and before long even his teachers started noticing the similarities.

Model: Romeo Beckham featured in the Burberry Spring Summer 2013 campaign

His similarities don't end at just his looks though with him being only 15 days older than the famous footballer' son.

Now Mrs Taws, 39, has signed him up to a lookalike agency and he is believed to be the only Romeo lookalike in Britain.

She said: 'I spotted the resemblance after a friend of mine pointed it out one day.

'I always thought he looked like Justin Bieber but then I realised he looked much more like Romeo Beckham.

'I started matching up pictures of Romeo and Evan and realised the similarity was uncanny.

'When I searched lookalike agencies there was only a David, Victoria and Harper lookalike but no Romeo so I realised Evan must be the only one.'

He even managed to bag himself one of the classic Burberry trench coats after his mum scoured the internet for one.

Mrs Taws said: 'Romeo is known for the iconic Burberry modelling and I thought the best photos of Evan would be of him posing similarly to that shoot.

'Finding the coat was just complete luck but I knew I had to get it as people would always want the iconic looks recreated.

'As it is a high end brand I'm hoping the coat lasts him a decent amount of time but I'm sure he will grow out of it pretty quickly.'

Evan's mother now hopes that he continues to grow up looking similar to Romeo so that he can always keep his famous looks

She had always thought the similarity was just a joke shared between family and friends but when strangers started noticing she realised that there was a chance for Evan to do something about it.

This was when she had the idea to put him forward for a lookalike agency.

'Evan thinks it's a good bit of fun and I would make sure it wouldn't get in the way of school or his hobbies.

'He plays football for our local team and thoroughly enjoys it.

'His sister also plays football and the two of them get on really well, even if she does make fun of him for looking so much like Romeo.

'He used to get really embarrassed about it but now he loves it and says he is a hit with the ladies.'

Victoria Beckham and Mrs Taws were pregnant at the same time but little did she know that this wouldn't be where the similarities would end.

She now hopes that he continues to grow up looking similar to Romeo so that he can always keep his famous looks.

Evan said: 'When my mum made a joke about it at first I didn't even know who he was.

'My sister said I looked like Justin Bieber but I didn't like being compared to him too much.

'When I realised who Romeo Beckham was I was really happy as I love football and his dad is such an amazing football legend.

'I was hoping I could fool people into thinking my dad was David Beckham and see what they say.'His mother added: 'I just wish his dad looked a bit more like David.'

Evan said: 'When my mum made a joke about it at first I didn't even know who he was'
