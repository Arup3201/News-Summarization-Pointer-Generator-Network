David Beckham’s move to play football in Paris has landed him in a row over taxes.

The 37-year-old says he will receive just the minimum wage while the rest of his pay package is donated to charity. The deal means that high French taxes do not make a dent in his fortune while he plays for Paris St Germain.

This has angered many French, including one MP who mocked Beckham’s accountant for saying the former England captain will work for only £2,000 a month. ‘He will be paid less than my parliamentary assistant!’ said conservative Gerald Darmanin. ‘Be serious!’

Controversy: David Beckham's deal with PSG - which means he will pay the vast majority of his salary to charity - has caused uproar among some French MPs

Deal: Under French law PSG must pay Beckham the minimum wage so that national insurance and other charges go the government

Beckham’s arrangement involves 
limiting his contract to five months, keeping his family based in 
London, and saying he will give his salary to charity. All of this 
enables both Beckham and PSG to concentrate on making millions from the 
ex-England captain’s image rights, while paying far less tax.

The £2,000-a-month salary represents the minimum wage for professional footballers in France.

Mr Darmanin added: ‘It is necessary to
convince the Sports Minister to stop this deadly tax process. I’d 
rather receive 50 per cent of a lot than 75 per cent of nothing!’

Beckham will give about £700,000 a 
month of wages to charity – but it is understood that PSG will pay this 
direct, and not the player.

This, along with the fact Beckham will
not live in France for longer than six months, ensures he will not 
become liable for a 1.5 per cent tax on his worldwide income and 
estimated wealth of £200million – a possible bill of £3million.

Money-spinner: The deal doesn't prevent Beckham and PSG making money from his commercial rights with his shirts selling for around £100

Jerome Guedj, a Socialist MP, insisted 
that France would benefit in the long run from Beckham being in Paris.

‘Me, I see a symbol,' he said. 'He will create wealth around PSG, image 
rights, jerseys sold by PSG. This is proof that the tax system in France
does not leak.’

Both Beckham and PSG will be able to make money from the ex-England captain’s image rights and other commercial activities.

His share of merchandising rights is 
likely to be paid into one of the three London-based companies. Footwork
Productions, which exploits Beckham’s name and image, including work 
for Armani, Adidas, Samsung and Diet Coke, paid him nearly £86million in salary and dividends from 2002 to 2010.

PSG is already promoting David Beckham shirts on 
the club’s website, with an adult top featuring his name and number 
costing almost £100.

L’Equipe, the biggest sports paper 
in the country, has already suggested that ‘football’s glamour icon’ was
little more than a money-spinning fairground attraction.

It carried a 
cartoon of the ‘S’ in PSG turned into a dollar sign last week, and 
wrote: ‘With the signature of the Spice Boy David Beckham yesterday, PSG
pulled off a sensational publicity stunt. The sporting interest of the 
move is less clear.’  

Others were even more cruel – with Le Figaro newspaper branding Beckham a ‘third-hand Rolls Royce’.
