Johns Hopkins University has been left red-faced after mistakenly sending welcome messages to almost 300 applicants who had actually been denied.

The emails sent Sunday afternoon with the subject line 'Embrace the YES!', urged recipients to visit the school store, start using the Twitter handle #JHU2019 and join a Facebook group exclusively for students.

Officials at the prestigious private Baltimore college told The Washington Post it was a mistake of human error.

At the click of a button: Johns Hopkins University has been left red-faced after mistakenly sending welcome messages to almost 300 applicants who had actually been denied

Senior admissions administrator, David Phillips, says a contractor who works on electronic communications pulled the wrong email list.

Of the 294 applicants who received the incorrect message, 285 had actually been denied bids for early admissions and nine had received deferrals.

'We apologize to the students affected and to their families,' Phillips said.

He continued: ''Admissions decision days are stressful enough. 

'We very much regret having added to the disappointment felt by a group of very capable and hardworking students, especially ones who were so committed to the idea of attending Johns Hopkins that they applied early decision.'

Cathy Stephenson of Culpeper County, Virginia, says she's irate that her son received a mistaken admission notice after an earlier denial.  

She says university officers should make personal calls to apologize and the mistake is 'inexcusable.'

Phillips said  such calls were not made because it would only draw further attention to the problem.

On their website, the university said it received a total of 1,865 applications for the class of 2019 and admitted 539 new students.
