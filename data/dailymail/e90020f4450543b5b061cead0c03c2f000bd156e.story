Killers: Mick and Mairead Philpott are currently serving prison sentences for the manslaughter of six of their children in a house fire

Two women claimed they were raped by child killer Mick Philpott as they gave evidence to police about the fire in which six of his children died.

The 56-year-old is currently serving a life sentence in Wakefield prison for manslaughter after the blaze at a house fire in Derby last year.

A woman who was being interviewed as a witness as part of the original investigation told detectives she had been raped by Philpott in his caravan after he drugged her tea in 2005.

Officers took a separate statement from the alleged victim at the time.

She told the Daily Mirror: 'It was rape. He makes my flesh crawl.'

And now it has emerged a second woman also made a rape allegation against Philpott as she was speaking to officers investigating the fire.

The woman told the Daily Mirror, Philpott forced himself on her as they slept in the downstairs bedroom of a relative's home in Derby in March, 1996.

The two women will now be formally interviewed about the rape allegations.

If detectives believe the claims warrant a new investigation they plan to interview Philpott in Wakefield prison.

Philpott started the blaze with the help of wife Mairead and friend Paul Mosley while their six children were sleeping upstairs in May last year.

They had hatched an elaborate plot in which Mick would save the children and the fire would be blamed on his estranged partner.

The cramped three-bedroom semi-detached home in Derby was shared by Mick Philpott, his wife, mistress and all 11 children he had with both women

Philpott was locked in a legal battle with her for custody of the four children they had together.

Jade Philpott, 10, and her brothers 
Duwayne, 13, John, nine, Jack, eight, Jesse, six and Jayden, five, died 
from the effects of smoke inhalation following the fire.

Mick was sentenced to life in prison with a minimum 15 year term. Mairead and Mosley were jailed for 17 years for manslaughter and must serve at least half their sentence.

In a statement, Derbyshire Police said: 'We can confirm that officers from Derbyshire Constabulary are making inquiries into allegations of further offences committed by Mick Philpott.

'These allegations came to light during the investigation into the fire in May last year in which his children died.Â  He, his wife and their friend were later convicted of the manslaughter of six children.

'Investigations are continuing and it would be inappropriate to make any further comment at this time.'
