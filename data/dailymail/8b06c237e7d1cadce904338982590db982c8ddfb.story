A high school valedictorian from Oklahoma who had gone missing over a week ago while on a family trip to Ecuador has been sighted in the back of a pick-up truck headed towards the Amazon rainforest, it was revealed today.

August Reiger, 18, was on a trek in the Banos mountains on June 16 when he walked ahead of the group and vanished.

More than 150 police officers and volunteers have searched the area -
a popular tourist spot not reportedly known for kidnappings or disappearances.

Friends and family of the Classen School of Advanced Studies valedictorian continued to search for him in Ecuador this week, and now they are getting assistance from the U.S. government.

President Barack Obama has officially declared Reiger a 'missing patriot' after being briefed on the case, and the teenager's family were able to meet with Ecuadorian ministers of the interior and of tourism Monday to discuss the case.

On Tuesday, it was announced that the Ecuadoran government is offering a reward for Reiger's safe return.

‘Obviously he’s gone and we can’t find out where he is,’ cousin Laura Laporte told the television station NewsChannel4. ‘It’s very nice to hear that the U.S. government is giving us attention and getting involved.’

Warnings have been issued in provinces spanning the entire country of Ecuador after local police announced that a credible source reported seeing the 18-year-old in the back of a vehicle headed towards the Amazon region.

'It's a little scary to know that August could be in the hands of somebody that's a dangerous person or persons,' Reiger's aunt, Cristi Reiger, told the station KOCO. 'On the other hand, the family is elated because we know he's alive.'

Reiger’s loved ones have reiterated what they had stated on previous occasions: the possibility that the 18-year-old high school graduate had disappeared of his own accord is out of the question.

'He’s sweet,' Laporte said. 'People love him. He has big plans.'

Laporte and the rest of the family fear that the well-traveled 18-year-old has been kidnapped. 

'If that’s the case, we want to plead for mercy,' she said. 'We want to plead to the people who may have him keep him safe and bring him home.'

The teen's relatives and friends are urging people to put pressure on their local congressional representatives to reach out to the American Embassy in the Ecuadorian capital of Quito.

Reiger's loved ones have set up the Facebook page Find August Reiger to share information on the latest developments in the search for the teen with their supporters. 

The social media page includes altered photos of the missing 18-year-old showing how Reiger might look with closely cropped hair and with a shorter haircut.

Reiger's father, Chris, said his son was 'only a few minutes ahead of us in the trail' and he hoped to see him at a popular landmark.

He believes his son could have fallen off a steep ledge of the mountain, in an area he described as an Ecuadorean version of Aspen, Colorado.

'We assumed that he'd be sitting there waiting for us,' he told News9.

'In fact, the second son had gotten there before
us, and he was sitting there waiting...but he hadn't seen his brother.'

He said the family would stay in Ecuador until his son - who was not carrying any money - was found, and he would post missing persons posters around town.

'Everybody
is both shocked and baffled, because they say nothing like this has 
happened in this town,' Mr Reiger said last week.

He told The Oklahoman that the 
entire trail is visible from his hotel, so it's unlikely his son - fluent in Spanish - got 
lost. He also added that no one has asked for a ransom.

The U.S. Embassy says it is in close contact with the Reiger family while investigators in Ecuador search for the missing man, according to News9.

Reiger, who graduated as a valedictorian from Classen School of Advanced Studies last month, loves anthropology and was offered a University of Oklahoma Fulbright scholarship.

He is a National Merit Scholar, an Oklahoma Academic Scholar and a member of the National Honor Society.

His mom, Randa Reiger, is an art teacher at Heronville Elementary.

Candace Lockett, the mother of Reiger's girlfriend Kaylee Sue Lockett, said she didn't believe Reiger ran away.

'I know he loves his girlfriend very much and wants to come home and see her,' she told KOCO.com.
