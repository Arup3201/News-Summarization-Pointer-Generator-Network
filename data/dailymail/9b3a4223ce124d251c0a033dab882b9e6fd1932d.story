When a nurse's car became stranded in the floods in South Gloucestershire, she thought she would soon be rescued.

But after wading out of the water and calling the RAC, Sarah Tosh was shocked to be told that it would not help her - because 
she did not have her credit card details to hand.

Ms Tosh, who is in her 40s, has been an RAC member for 22 years - but she had left the cards in her stricken Toyota.

Sarah Tosh, (pictured with her car at a Toyota garage in Patchway, South Gloucestershire) said the RAC refused to rescue her after she became stranded in flooding because she left her credit cards in her stricken vehicle

She was forced to turn to a fellow driver in a four-by-four for help, and her car was pulled to safety.

Ms Tosh, from Charfield, South Gloucestershire, had just finished a ten hour nursing shift on Monday evening.

She had first got into trouble when she followed a Land Rover down a cut through from Yate to Thornbury.

Her car cut out in the deepest part of the flooded road, leaving her trapped as the vehicle in front sped off, unaware.

After being told she could not be helped by her breakdown company, Sarah was helped out of her submerged Toyota by another driver and her car was towed to safety.

She said: 'It makes me so angry to think the RAC would not just make a small compromise for me stuck in the middle of nowhere in the darkness.

Deluge: South Gloucestershire is one of several parts of the country to suffer severe flooding following heavy rains during the last few days. Pictured, a car drives through flood water in Mobberley, Cheshire

Submerged: Some areas have been completely covered in flood water during the wet weather. Here a grassy area of Rickerby Park in Carlisle (pictured) is submerged after more heavy overnight rain

'I have been with them since 1990 and I expected a little more sympathy from the company.

'I know they were busy but they out right refused to come and save me unless I paid in advance.

'I explained to them how I had left my credit card behind when I abandoned the car.

'I was scared and tired and needed help. It is unbelievable.

'I hope it never happens to anyone else.'

She claims that when she first called RAC they told her she had to pay if she wanted help.

'I thought it was unreasonable but I understood that I wasn’t covered so I accepted,' she said.

'Then they told me if I didn’t have my card details they couldn’t send someone out, despite being on their record for the last 22 years.'

Ms Tosh said the firm take regular payments out of her account so they must have had her details on record.

'It just seems so unfair that they couldn’t come out and wait until the car was recovered before I paid,' she said.

'It is no way to treat loyal customers.'

She said that if she had not been helped by passing drivers she would have been wading back down
to her car through the cold water in the dark.

She said: 'The spirit of Britishness is 
clearly not lost. They stopped for me and chipped in and got me out 
despite the horrendous conditions.'

A spokesperson at the RAC, based in 
Bristol, said that after looking into the case in detail, 'we feel we should have shown Ms Tosh some flexibility in how she could pay our call-out fee, particularly as she has been a loyal RAC member for 22 years.

'As a result chief executive Chris Woodhouse has apologised to Ms Tosh personally and offered her a year's free membership as compensation for the way she was treated.

Mr Woodhouse said: 'The adverse weather of the last few days obviously put our call centre team under a lot of pressure but this was no excuse for not looking to help a long-term member who really needed our help.

'I rang Ms Tosh personally to apologise and express my disappointment at the way this situation was handled.

'This was an unusual and unfortunate incident and not how we seek to serve our members.

'RAC prides itself on the quality of service it gives to members which is why 98 per cent of our members say they would recommend us to their friends and family.'
