Police have issued a warning to online daters after a New Zealand woman, 28, was allegedly gang-raped by a group of men on Saturday night in Sydney's south.

The New Zealander was on a business trip when she met up with a man from mobile dating app Tinder.

The woman told police they met at a restaurant in Kings Cross - Sydney's inner city - before the pair moved on to a bar in Martin Place and was later joined by the man's friends.

But she believes her drink got spiked after she felt dizzy, numb and later found herself at an unknown property. She says this was where she was sexually assaulted by the group of men.

Police warned that Tinder-users should take extra caution when meeting people from online as they are of 'sexual predators out there who use modern technology to find potential victims'

This comes after a New Zealand woman met up with a man at Kings Cross, Sydney's inner city, on Saturday night after speaking to him through mobile dating app Tinder

The woman was able to leave the property, believed to be in the Botany area in Sydney's south, on Sunday morning. 

She told colleagues about the incident before they informed police.

Police warned that Tinder-users should take extra caution when meeting people from online.

'The vast majority of people who use dating websites and apps do so for the right reasons but there are a number of sexual predators out there who use modern technology to find potential victims,' Detective Inspector Michael Haddow said.  

He further advised that those thinking of meeting someone from dating websites or apps should bring a friend on the date.

'It's absolutely vital that people using dating websites and apps remember that how a person portrays themselves on the internet can be very different from their real life persona,' Detective Inspector Haddow said.

'With this in mind, we strongly advise people that if they decide to meet a person they have been introduced to via the internet, then ensure the meeting is in a public place and take a friend along with you.

'Having a friend there ensures that one of you can always keep an eye on your drink, and you have someone to turn to who can help you out should you feel threatened or uncomfortable.

'If it's not possible to bring a friend with you, then, at the very least, stay in regular contact with a family member or friend, keeping them abreast of how the night is going and where you may be heading to.'

The man, who met the New Zealand tourist in Kings Cross, is described as being of Pacific Islander/Maori appearance.

The woman was treated at a Sydney hospital on Monday but has now returned to New Zelaand where she is being supported by family. 

Police say they have no further information at this stage.
