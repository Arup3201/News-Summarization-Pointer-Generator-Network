If you’re a Saturnian, it’s time to reset your clocks because it’s been discovered that a day lasts just 10 hours, 32 minutes and 45 seconds - seven minutes shorter than previously thought.

Saturn’s rotation period - the time it takes to rotate once around its axis - has been notoriously difficult to estimate in the past because of the planet’s unique properties.

But using measurements of the ringed planet’s gravitational field combined with its shape and density, scientists have determined a more exact value for a day on the planet.

Scientists in Israel have revealed a new estimated rotation speed for the ringed planet (shown). Previously it was thought to rotate in 10 hours, 39 minutes and 22 seconds. But new figure of 10 hours, 32 minutes and 45 seconds is more accurate. This is based on measuring its gravitational field, shape and density

The research was carried out by scientists at Tel Aviv University in Israel.

Radio measurements by the Voyager spacecraft had estimated Saturn's day at 10 hours, 39 minutes and 22.4 seconds in the 1980s.

In 2006, astronomers used more advanced equipment to measure the planet's rotation ending up with a measurement of about 10 hours and 47 minutes.

But an estimate that was 12 minutes shorter in 2009 only added to the confusion.

Mercury: 58 days and 15 hours

Venus: 243 days

Earth: 23 hours, 56 minutes, 4 seconds

Mars: 24 hours, 39 minutes, 35 seconds

Jupiter: 9.9 hours

Saturn: 10 hours, 32 minutes and 45 seconds

Uranus: 17 hours, 14 minutes and 24 seconds

Neptune: 16 hours, 6 minutes and 36 seconds

The new method, though, provides what might be the most accurate reading so far.

Gas giants - such as Saturn and Jupiter - do not have solid objects on their surface that allow their rotation period to be observed, so other methods of finding this property must be found. 

The same formula came up with the correct rotation period of Jupiter - which was already known owing to its tilted magnetic field.

Saturn’s magnetic pole is aligned with its rotational axis and this means - unlike Jupiter - its rotation period cannot be calculated using the magnetic field alone.

But verifying the method with Jupiter allowed scientists to apply the same technique to Saturn.

Alternative methods such as measuring Saturn’s radio emissions or wind field, or tracking the planet’s clouds, had only served to increase uncertainty and resulted in a rotation period of between 10 hours and 32 minutes and 10 hours and 47 minutes.

Scientists used measurements of the ringed planet’s gravitational field combined with its shape and density, some of which was gathered by the Cassini spacecraft in orbit (artist's illustration shown)

‘The alignment of Saturn’s magnetic pole with its rotation axis precludes the use of magnetic field measurements to determine its rotation period,’ said planetary scientist Dr Ravit Helled of Tel Aviv University.

‘Here we report a period of 10 hours 32 minutes 45 seconds (plus or minus 46 seconds) based upon an optimisation approach using Saturn’s measured gravitational field and limits on the observed shape and possible internal density profiles.

‘To validate our method we applied the same procedure to Jupiter and correctly recovered its well-known rotation period.’

Gas giants - such as Saturn and Jupiter - do not have solid objects on their surface that allow their rotation period to be observed, so other methods of finding this property must be found.

The study, published online in Nature, could be used in the future to derive the rotation period of other giant planets and planets outside our solar system.
