For 150 years this oak tree towered above the gentle rolling Devon landscape.

It was brought crashing down last month, a casualty of the storms which caused the greatest loss of trees since 1987.

Raef Johnson, National Trust ranger at Knightshayes Court, himself standing at six foot and two inches tall, is dwarfed by the giant’s 20-foot root span.

The trees were casualties of the storms which caused the greatest loss of trees since 1987

One of the trees, a turkey oak specimen, stood 100 feet above the ground before it was felled, one of 50 trees lost at the Knightshayes estate

The tree, a turkey oak specimen, stood 100 feet above the ground before it was felled, one of 50 trees lost at the Knightshayes estate.

Mr Johnson’s team has had to clear and remove 500 tonnes of timber. He said: ‘We have now had more than a fortnight without any epic winds or downpours, the ground is drying up and the trees are remaining vertical.

‘I can now sleep a lot easier in the knowledge that if the trees that are left stood up to this winter’s barrage, they can stand up to anything.’

Matthew Oates, the trust’s nature and wildlife specialist, added: ‘Too many old beech, oak and ash trees have been lost. We value and venerate these old sentinels and need to become increasingly aware of the power of the weather.’

The root span of many of the trees that fell is around 15 by 20 foot

The National Trust now has to become increasingly cautious when it comes to the newer trees as the older trees have been knocked down
