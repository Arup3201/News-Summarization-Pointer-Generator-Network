One woman got the birthday surprise of a lifetime when she found out that, not only was her boyfriend proposing that very day, he had actually been secretly popping the question every single day for the last year. 

Dean Smith, from Scottsdale, Arizona, made a video for his girlfriend Jennifer Kessel that showed the 365 days he asked for her hand in marriage.

The reveal happened during a large family trip to Aruba, where Jennifer was instructed via a whiteboard held by her sister Jaclyn to go down to the lobby. 

There her brother and then a friend helped lead Jennifer to the beach, where her father and stepmother were waiting to hand her a device where she could watch the film.

Behind you! Dean Smith approaches girlfriend Jennifer on the Aruba beach while the heartfelt video he spent one-year making counts down to its emotional conclusion 

The video cuts to a film Dean made the exact same day a year before. 'Today is the day that I decided I want to spend the rest of my life with you,' he reveals

'By now you've probably realized that your birthday surprise is in the form of this video,' Smith begins on screen. 

'What you don't know is that I've been planning this birthday surprise for over a year now.' 

The video then cuts to a film Dean made on Jennifer's birthday the previous year.

'I just wanted to make this video to tell you that today is the day that I decided I want to spend the rest of my life with you,' he reveals. 

But, Dean says in the film, he wanted to find a way to propose to Jennifer that would show her just how much he loved her, and that he thought about her 'literally every moment of every day'.

The film then shows each of those 365 proposals.

But the message on the whiteboard is almost always the same. 'Jennifer, will you marry me?', 'Will you be my wife?', 'Make me the happiest man in the world', 'I love you so much, Jen'. 

Interspersed with the messages are snippets of Jen and the couple together that Dean had filmed throughout the year. 

After the video finally reaches to the proposal Dean made just the day before, it instructs Jennifer to turn around. There Dean was waiting, whiteboard in hand, ready to pop the question one last time

There right behind her is Dean, whiteboard in hand, ready to pop the question one last time.

Jennifer is so overwhelmed that she has to pause to compose herself with a tissue before walking up to meet him. 

And then Dean bends down on one knee, as the sun dips into the Caribbean sea. 

She says yes.
