Dani Alves' fashion sense has always been suspect, but the Barcelona star has pleased fans of the old fashioned American rock 'n' roll with a throwback to pop legend Elvis Presley.

The Brazilian right-back posted a picture on Instagram dressed with a studded leather jacket and sunglasses on Thursday.

It's not the first time Alves has attempted to impress his followers.

Last month Alves showed potential Barclays Premier League suitors that he is fighting fit.

The 31-year-old posted a video of himself lifting weights in the gym during the international break and left some words of wisdom for his fans.

Alves, wanted by Liverpool and both Manchester clubs, wrote 'in life there are those who think they want something... but do not fight for what they want'.
