Former world 100m champion Yohan Blake wants to play cricket for Yorkshire when he retires from athletics.

The
 24-year-old Jamaican has been offered a nets session by the county side
 and wants to follow in the steps of former West Indies captain Richie 
Richardson by playing at Headingley when he hangs up his spikes.

Blake
 compared his style to that of England fast bowler Jimmy Anderson and 
added: ‘Cricket is my first love. I’ve been wanting to play for 
Yorkshire or in England.

Looking ahead: Yohan Blake is hoping to play county cricket for Yorkshire when he retires from athletics

‘I
 run in so fast and with my strong shoulders you know, I want to see how
 quick I am through the air. I’m going to get it measured.’

Blake
 said he hoped to watch Lancashire take on Worcestershire in the NatWest
 T20 Blast at Old Trafford after he bids to break his training partner 
Usain Bolt’s world 150 metres record at the Great CityGames in 
Manchester on Saturday afternoon.

‘I
 might swing by,’ he said. ‘I would love to see Andrew Flintoff in 
action. There’s T20 and Freddie Flintoff is not playing because of a 
little knee injury!

‘He’s
 a dangerous guy. I remember him come to the West Indies in 2005. I 
think I was in school and that guy was so dominant. I look up to him. I 
really look up to him as like his aggression and temperament.’

Heading north? Blake is keen to take part in the Commonwealth Games in Glasgow this summer

The 
sprinter, who missed last season’s world championships with a hamstring 
injury, said he has still yet to reach his peak and is targeting 
breaking his 100 metres personal best of 9.69secs this season, while 
Bolt’s world record of 9.58secs is not ‘untouchable’.

Blake
 said: ‘This is a good year to return to top form. When I came on the 
scene in 2009 I’ve been leaving personal bests every end of the year so 
you might see one this year.

‘If
 I break the world record it’s my time. Usain’s had his time, and is 
still having it. Whatever I do this season I just want to give a 
surprise to the world. My potential is far greater than what I’m running
 now.

‘I
 wouldn’t say Usain’s record is untouchable. Scientists have proven that
 the human body couldn’t go faster than 9.7secs, but we have raised the 
bar. I think it’s touchable.’

Elite
 sprinting has come under scrutiny in recent weeks, with high profile 
athletes such as Tyson Gay and Asafa Powell both banned for doping 
offences, but Blake insisted he is happy to run against former drug 
cheats and can ‘beat them clean’.

Track and field: Blake could go from competing in athletics venues like London's Olympic Stadium...

Anyone for cricket? ... to playing county cricket at English grounds like Headingley in Leeds

Beat them clean: Blake says he is happy to race the likes of Powell and Gay who have served drugs bans

The
 Jamaican, who served a three-month ban in 2009 after testing positive 
for methylxanthine, a substance that was not initially on the World 
Anti-Doping Agency’s banned list, said: ‘It’s bad but I close my mind 
from it because I don’t want to hear nothing about it.

‘There’s
 always a little bit of concern in your mind (what people think about 
all sprinters), but you know what you can do and how strong and positive
 you are on the track, so you don’t worry about it. Of course you can 
believe what you’re seeing on the track.

‘Tyson
 Gay is coming back soon and I’m happy. I love running with him. He’s a 
great competitor. Whatever he does I’m ready. I can beat them clean.’
