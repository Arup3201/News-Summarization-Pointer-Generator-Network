New York's first immigrant Juan Rodriguez who arrived in the city in 1613 has had a three-mile stretch of Broadway named after him

New York's very first immigrant has been honoured with a three mile stretch of Broadway named after him, 400 years after arriving in the Big Apple.

Juan Rodriguez, a sailor and trader from the Dominican Republic, is widely believed to be the first non-native American to have ever set foot in the city.

While the street in its entirety, will continue to be known as Broadway, from 159th Street in Washington Heights to 218th Street in Inwood, it will now go by the additional name of Juan Rodriguez Way.

Yesterday a renaming ceremony was held in Mitchel Square Park and May 15 was celebrated uptown as Juan Rodriguez Day.

Ramona Hernandez, director of the City University of New York’s Dominican Studies Institute told The New York Daily News: 'We are happy, we are dancing!

'It’s a carnival, a festival, and a celebration of a man who came here many, many years ago, and gave the Dominicans a claim on this great city at the very beginning of its history.'

Quite how Rodriguez cam to end up in New York is a matter of some debate.

It is generally accepted that he arrived on the vessel Jonge Tobias from Santo Domingo under the Dutch sea captain Thijs Mossel.

When Mossel set sail to return to the Netherlands, Rodriguez was left behind - either having decided to stay for himself or having been marooned.

Mossel himself insisted that Rodriguez had abandoned ship and remained on the island voluntarily

In sworn affidavits crew members testified that the 'mulatto' or 'Spaniard' had 'run away from the ship and gone ashore against their intent'.

They even suggested that they ought to have killed him when he refused to board ship and sail back to Europe.

Rodriguez is believed to have mastered the local Indian language and set up a small trading post and may have eventually settled down marrying an Indian woman.

During the winter he moved to a Dutch 
fur trading post which had been set up on what is now Lower Manhattan by
 Christiaan Hendricksen earlier that year.

A
 report by the Dominican Studies Institute read: 'Juan Rodriguez happens
 to be the first historically recorded individual of non-Native American
 ancestry to have ever resided in what is today metropolitan New York, 
before the Dutch named their settlement New Amsterdam.'

Ramona
 Hernandez, of the City University of New York described Rodriguez as 
'the first immigrant, the first black person, the first merchant, the 
first Latino and, to us, the first Dominican to have ever lived in New 
York City.'

Juan Rodriguez

Records of Juan Rodriguez are few and far between and what little is known about him comes chiefly from the records and ships' logs of Dutch traders.

He was raised in the Spanish settlement of Santo Domingo in the Dominican Republic.

A skilled linguist, he was was hired by the Dutch sea captain Thijs Volckenz Mossel in 1613 to serve as the translator on a trading expedition to the Native American island of Mannahatta.

When Mossel's set sail to return to the Netherlands, Rodriguez, who had already learnt the Algonquinian language of the native Lenape people, remained ashore setting up a trading post.

Mossel had left him eighty hatchets, some knives, a musket and a sword which he used to barter with the indians. Rodriguez later married an Indian woman.

During the winter he moved to a Dutch fur trading post which had been set up on what is now Lower Manhattan by Christiaan Hendricksen earlier that year.

The small outpost formed part of the network of Dutch settlements that would become New Amsterdam and eventually New York City.

Much of what is known about Rodriguez comes from records concerning the Dutch fur trader Adriaen Block.

Block was furious when captain Mossel arrived and accused him of trying to 'spoil the trade' by offering indians three times more for a beaver pelts than he did.

In a report submitted to the Amsterdam Notary upon his return to Holland, Block claims crewman Rodriguez had become a permanent fixture in Manhattan, trading and living alone among the natives.

Rodriguez had taken it upon himself to gain friendship with the natives, set up a trading post, and live comfortably on Manhattan Island.

Later Hendrick Christiaensen captain of the Dutch ship the Fortuyn describes in his log how Rodrigues came aboard the Nachtegaal, presented himself as a freeman, and offered to work for Christiaensen trading furs.
