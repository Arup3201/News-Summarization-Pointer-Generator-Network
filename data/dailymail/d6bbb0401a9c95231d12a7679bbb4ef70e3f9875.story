With the arrival of the January transfer window comes an opportunity for managers to reassess their squads and strengthen where necessary.

It brings the opportunity for Arsenal and Manchester United to sort out their defensive issues, for Tottenham to alleviate the pressure on Harry Kane, and for Chelsea and Manchester City to trim the dead wood.

Here, Sportsmail's Simon Jones provides the details of the budgets and transfer targets of the Premier League's top six clubs. 

Chelsea are not actively looking to sign any players but retain an interest in Inter Milan forward Mauro Icardi

Andre Schurrle has struggled for form and game-time at Chelsea this season and could be sold

Mohamed Salah is wanted in a loan deal by QPR and Roma after failing to make his mark at Chelsea

CHELSEA

Chelsea's decisiveness in the summer transfer market led Jose Mourinho to claim he had no interest in adding to his squad in January. And considering the Blues have been top of the league since the first day you can't blame him. They are, however, interested in offloading players.

BUDGET: £30m

TARGETS: NONE (but they like Mauro Icardi, Inter Milan)

WHO’S GOING OUT: Mohamed Salah, possibly Roma, Loan; Andre Schurrle, possibly Schalke £23m

Manchester City are interested in former Chelsea man Kevin de Bruyne, who is now at Wolfsburg

Wilfried Bony, 26, joined Manchester City on a four-and-a-half-year deal, he will wear the No 14 shirt 

Alexandre Lacazette has scored 22 goals in all competitions this season for Lyon

Scott Sinclair could finally about to end his nightmare spell at Manchester City

MANCHESTER CITY

After a slow start to the season that saw the champions slip as low as sixth in the table, Manuel Pellegrini's side have established some consistency and proved they can cope without star man injury-prone Sergio Aguero. Even so, the arrival of Wilfried Bony proves the club are not resting on their laurels.

BUDGET: £25m

TARGETS: NONE (but they like Kevin de Bruyne, Wolfsburg £30m and Alexandre Lacazette, Lyon £23m) 

DONE: Wilfried Bony £28m

WHO’S GOING OUT: Scott Sinclair, Aston Villa £2m; John Guidetti, Celtic £3m; Matija Nastasic, Schalke, Loan

Elijero Elia, pictured in the win against Manchester United, has signed for Southampton on loan 

Southampton are also interested in bringing in Braga's Rafa Silva, who would cost around £4m

SOUTHAMPTON

The predictions that Southampton would not be able to maintain their blistering start to the season have subsided. After beating Manchester United at Old Trafford, Ronald Koeman's side are third in the table, though they may need to add to the squad if they want to maintain their push for a Champions League spot.

BUDGET: £15m

TARGETS: Rafa Silva, Braga, £4m, Tonny Vilhena, Feyenoord, £3m

DONE: Eljero Elia, Loan

WHO’S GOING OUT: NONE

Edinson Cavani is being trailed by a host of clubs including Manchester United, but would cost around £35m

Manchester United have had a long-standing interest in Dortmund defender Mats Hummels (right)

Roma midfielder Kevin Strootman (right) is another target for the Manchester giants

Manchester United have already signed former Barcelona goalkeeper Victor Valdes

But the arrival of Valdes means Anders Lindegaard (left) could be heading for the exit

Southampton full back Nathaniel Clyne is a target for Louis van Gaal as he looks to strengthen his defence

MANCHESTER UNITED

Louis van Gaal and a host of summer signings have transformed the mood at Old Trafford, but this side is undeniably a work in progress. United are on track for their top-four finish but have struggled for consistency and may feel the need to add to the squad to continue their upward trajectory.

BUDGET: £100m

TARGETS: NONE (but they like Mats Hummels, Borussia Dortmund £35m; Pablo Dybala, Palermo £30m; Edinson Cavani, PSG, £35m; Nathaniel Clyne £15m, Southampton; Kevin Strootman, Roma £40m)

DONE: Victor Valdes

WHO’S GOING OUT: Darren Fletcher, possibly West Brom, £1m; Anders Lindegaard, possibly Molde £2m; Reece James, Loan

Arsenal may turn to West Ham defender Winston Reid to ease their injury problems at the back 

Another long-term target for Arsene Wenger is Sporting Lisbon midfielder William Carvalho (left)

Arsenal have agreed a fee for young Polish midfielder Krystian Bielik (centre) from Legia Warsaw

Joel Campbell (centre) could leave Arsenal after struggling to make appearances 

ARSENAL

Arsenal fans are experiencing familiar emotions this season. Impressive performances have been interspersed with defensive horror-shows. An all-too-familiar injury crisis is in place at the club and supporters have been clamouring for Arsene Wenger to invest in his squad.

BUDGET: £60m

TARGETS: Winston Reid, West Ham £6m; Hector Moreno Espanyol, £6m; Marcelo Brozovic, Dinamo Zagreb, £6m; William Carvalho, Sporting £18m; James McCarthy, Everton £25m

DONE: Krystian Bielik, Legia Warsaw £2.4m

WHO’S GOING OUT: Joel Campbell, possibly Real Sociedad, Loan

Both Arsenal and Tottenham are interested in Everton midfielder James McCarthy

Tottenham could turn to Burnley striker Danny Ings in a bid to alleviate pressure on Harry Kane

Tottenham are listening to offers for skipper Younes Kaboul just five months after he was given the armband

Another player who doesn't appear to be in Mauricio Pochettino's long-term plans is midfielder Paulinho

TOTTENHAM

Consistency has been an issue for Tottenham and some indifferent form led to questions about the manager. But Mauricio Pochettino is slowly shaping the team in his image. A top-four finish is the primary objective but squad additions are needed if that's to become a reality.

BUDGET: £30m

TARGETS: NONE (but they like James McCarthy, Everton £25m; Danny Ings, Burnley £7m; Carlos Bacca, Sevilla £18m, Soimone Zaza, Sassuolo)

WHO’S GOING OUT: Paulinho, Juventus, £8m; Younes Kaboul, possibly Besiktas, £5m; Aaron Lennon, possibly Stoke £7m; Kyle Naughton, possibly Swansea £4m, Emmanuel Adebayor, possibly Roma, £5m
