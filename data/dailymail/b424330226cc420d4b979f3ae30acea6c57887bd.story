Richie Vallance, a 35-year-old father, found what he believes to be space rocks scattered near to Henley Green Primary School, in Wyken Croft, Coventry

A sharp-eyed father believes he has found parts of a meteorite which have crashed to Earth in Coventry.

Richie Vallance has discovered dozens of odd-looking rocks and, having done his own research, is convinced that they are not of this world.

The 35-year-old found the rocks scattered near to Henley Green Primary School, in Wyken Croft, last week and also further afield.

With the help of advise on the Nasa website, the father of three conducted some tests at home and is keen to find someone who can back up his theory.

Nasa claims there are a number of signs that could suggest whether a rock is in fact a meteorite. 

For instance, meteorites contain at least some metal. Nasa claims if you see the metal shining on a broken surface you may have a meteorite. 

Those meteorites that do have a lot of metal tend to be very dense compared to regular rocks. 

Many meteorites also contain iron-nickel metal grains or are made up largely of iron-nickel which can attract a magnet. 

Mr Vallance's discovery came just days after a fireball, believed to be a meteorite, was caught on film by the dashboard camera of a police car near Solihull.

The footage was filmed in the early hours of Monday June 30 and the meteorite was reported to have also been spotted across England and over the border in Wales.

'I’ve been doing some research and they pass lots of the tests,' said Mr Vallance. 'You can see the metal running through the rocks, there’s iron running all over it and magnets even stick to it'

The magnetic rocks were discovered in Coventry last week by Mr Vallance

Mr Vallance said: 'I’ve always been fascinated by space and what’s going on out there and I’m hoping that someone can help me to verify this. 

‘I found them all around the area near the school and when I found these I felt my heart really start going.

'I’ve been doing some research and they pass lots of the tests. You can see the metal running through the rocks, there’s iron running all over it and magnets even stick to it.

'Also when you cut in to it, it is shiny inside and not dull like a normal stone is.

'There have been some meteorites that have gone over us recently and I just want to find out exactly what it is as it has baffled me.

'I’ve found some other stones before that are really interesting to look at but they are just slag, which is common around here and looks similar, but it comes from the steel works that used to be around here.'

Metal - Meteorites contain at least some metal. If you see the metal shining on a broken surface you may have a meteorite.

Density – Those meteorites that do have a lot of metal tend to be very dense compared to regular rocks.

Magnetic properties – A lot of meteorites contain iron-nickel metal grains or are made up largely of iron-nickel which can attract a magnet.

Chondrules – Primitive meteorites have little round pieces of stony material in them. These little round pieces are called chondrules.

Fusion crust –
 When a meteorite falls through the atmosphere, it begins to heat up. 
This causes the outer surface to begin melting, producing a thin 
black/brown coating on the surface of the rock.

‘Thumbprints’ –
 When the surface of the meteorite begins tomelt during entry into the 
atmosphere, some areas of the meteorites are eroded by the melting more 
than others. 

This leaves a small dents in the surface of the rock, making it look like someone put thumbprints into clay.

Mr Vallance is now hoping to find an expert who can verify his find.

Because meteorites are relatively scarce, they are priced and sold by the gram.

Depending on their quality and type, iron meteorite prices are generally in the range from 30p to £3 per gram.
