Chic in a double-breasted black coat, Sophie Wessex cut a solemn figure as she watched the Remembrance Sunday ceremony unfold  from her vantage point on a Whitehall balcony.

Like the Duchess of Cambridge, the Countess wore a £1,625 Alexander McQueen coat with a delicate, jewelled poppy and a feathered cocktail hat, leaving the two looking strikingly similar - and not for the first time.

Now on the cusp of 50, Sophie Wessex is more polished  than ever before and boasts a wardrobe that rivals the Duchess of Cambridge's own, complete with many of the younger royal's favourite labels.

Polished: The Duchess of Cambridge and the Countess of Wessex both opted for £1,625 Alexander McQueen coats yesterday

Like the Duchess of Cambridge, Sophie loves a bit of Alexander McQueen and is no stranger to the work of Emilia Wickstead. Indeed, the latter has become something of a staple for the Countess of Wessex, who regularly wears Wickstead ensembles for big events.

But Kate isn't the only royal to share an overlapping sense of style with the Countess. The Duchess of Cornwall's favourite designer, Bruce Oldfield, is another Sophie staple, while another name popular with both is Catherine Walker.

Nevertheless, it is the Duchess of Cambridge who has the most in common with Sophie, with show-stopping gowns, neatly tailored suits in flattering royal blue and cream, fitted blazers and chic cocktail hats by up-and-coming milliner Jane Taylor loved by both.

And while the Duchess of Cambridge has a stylist in the shape of former PA Natasha Archer, 27, Sophie's new look is all her own work - although she does nod to Kate's look on occasion.

Fussy: The Countess of Wessex was once a fan of unflattering fussy hats and boxy skirt suits in old-fashioned pastel hues

All change: Prior to her 1999 wedding and in the early noughties, Sophie's look was dominated by boxy suits and sequins

Improvements: Along with a sleeker approach to fashion, the Countess has also grown out the matronly bob she once sported

Either way, she's looking good and it hasn't gone unnoticed. 'The Countess of Wessex used to dress like the archetypal Sloane Ranger at a wedding circa 1985,' says stylist Stephanie Hirschmiller.

'Typical, in fact, of someone who found their style in their twenties and has never deviated since. However, in the last year she’s undergone a make-over of the best kind and has not only come out looking way more sophisticated, but 10 years younger too.'

Like the Duchess of Cambridge, the Countess of Wessex comes from relatively humble stock and is the daughter of retired car tyre salesman, Christopher Bournes Rhys-Jones, and his wife Mary.

Born and raised in the idyllic Kent village of Brenchley, the Countess' childhood was a happy one that saw her attend a series of private schools before completing a secretarial course at West Kent College in Tonbridge.

Unhappy with secretarial work, Sophie then embarked on a career in public relations, spending four years at Capital Radio before launching her own firm, RJH Public Relations, in 1996 and continued to work there after meeting and then marrying Prince Edward in 1999.

Favourite: Both the Duchess of Cambridge and Sophie Wessex are fans of Emilia Wickstead and even opt for similar designs

 Palace sources say Sophie has long been a favourite of the Queen, who supported her through her annus horribilis in 2002 when the Countess, who was still recovering from an ectopic pregnancy, was caught up in a newspaper sting orchestrated by the News of the World's notorious 'fake sheikh', Mazhar Mahmood. 

Despite the release of a statement in which Buckingham Palace described the article as 'selective, distorted and in several cases, flatly untrue', the Countess gave up her PR work to become a full time royal at the end of that year.

Since then, she has gone on to become a mother to Lady Louise, 11, and James, Viscount Severn, six, and has made a name for championing disability and children's charities.

She is also a trusted senior member of the Royal Family and regularly steps in for the Queen abroad, as she will do when she attends the funeral of Michael Sata, the late president of Zambia, in Lusaka this week.

But it is her increasingly chic style that is the most obvious sign of her growing confidence, with Daily Mail fashion editor Eliza Scarborough among those left impressed by her transformation.  

'The Countess of Wessex has a sophisticated and sleek look thanks to favourite designers such as Bruce Oldfield,' explains Scarborough. 'She tends to make a statement with her hats instead and loves one of Kate’s preferred milliners, Jane Taylor.'

Stylish: The Duchess of Cambridge and the Countess of Wessex are both fans of a flattering fit and flare silhouette

'Very few members of the royal family can be passed off as truly fashionable,' adds fashion expert and blogger, Simon Glazin, another fan of the Countess of Wessex' new look.

'I think we can probably count on one hand the icons: the late Princesses Diana and Margaret and now, to some, the Duchess of Cambridge. We forget Sophie but now more than ever she is getting it right every time we see her.

'Unlike the Duchess, Sophie seems to wear something new for each royal engagement. When her children were younger, she did the whole practical mum look, all flat shoes and loose dresses, but the last couple of years have seen Sophie amp up her style.

'She loves well fitting dresses that show off her shape, usually opting for block colours and sometimes with features that accentuate her waist in particular. And what she does best are jackets, whether cropped, peplum, belted or structural.

I love that she chose McQueen for Remembrance Sunday, along with The Duchess. Both look super chic. I'd love to see Sophie in some prints and maybe some more of the younger British designers, but right now she can't do a thing wrong.'

'Comparisons with the Duchess of Cambridge are inevitable,' concludes Hirschmiller, 'but whether Sophie is sharing her PA-cum-stylist Natasha Archer or not, this is classic contemporary dressing Noughties style – it won’t rock your world but it’s eminently well put-together and faultlessly stylish.'
