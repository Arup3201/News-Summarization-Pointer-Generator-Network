Sarah Clark won Commonwealth Games gold for Scotland in the under-63kg division when she beat Helene Wezeu Dombeu of Cameroon.

The 36-year-old Clark - a former European champion who won silver when judo was last in the Commonwealth Games at Manchester 2002 - showed no mercy as she quickly delivered victory with an arm-lock submission to claim a third judo gold for Scotland following the Renicks sisters' success at the SECC venue on Thursday.

England teenager Katie-Jemima Yeats-Brown secured a bronze medal when she beat Canadian Beatrice Valois Fortier, the defeated semi-finalist, with a 25-second hold-down ippon score.

It's real: Clark, a former European champion, beat Cameroon's Helene Wezeu Dombeu

Essex judoka Faith Pitman quickly followed suit after a waza-ari throw beat Australian Katharina Haecker.

Clark revealed she had some doubts over whether she could lift herself one more time.

'All day has been pretty nervous, and on the back of what happened yesterday (on Thursday), with all the medals Scotland won in the judo, I guess there is that added pressure,' she said.

'There were moments when I thought my body was not going to make it, even though you want to, and bits are falling off.

'They changed the rules recently, and that affected my judo, which put doubts in my head, but as I started getting fitter again, I made the decision I was going to compete, and if I was going to compete, then I was going to be as fit as possible, today (Friday) I could not have felt better.'

Yeats-Brown, who trains at British Judo's Walsall Centre of Excellence was also a late call-up to England's squad because of injury to Caroline Kinnane.

She said: 'I was meant to be doing Laser Quest today - I'd choose a Commonwealth medal over Laser Quest.

'I got the call on Tuesday morning at seven. I was actually quite annoyed because my mum said I could have a lie in, then shook my awake and asked if I would like to fight at the Commonwealth Games.

'I thought my mum had lost the plot, really, because selection was a couple of months ago.'
