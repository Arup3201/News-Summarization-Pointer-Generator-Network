The Uruguayan even managed to show Borini how it is done in front of goal with a typical striker's finish against Atletico.

Suarez, Neymar and Messi all managed to get on the scoresheet as the Catalans moved just one point behind Real Madrid.

Borini has been linked with a move back to Sunderland, after a successful loan spell at the Stadium of Light last season.
