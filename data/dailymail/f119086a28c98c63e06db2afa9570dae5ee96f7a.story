Jack Wilshere has thrown his full support behind England team-mate Wayne Rooney and his position as captain of the national side.

Rooney was named the new Three Lions skipper following the retirement of Steven Gerrard after the World Cup, but in his first match led Roy Hodgson's side out to an uninspiring 1-0 win over Norway at Wembley.

But Wilshere has backed the striker's senior role in the team and states the Manchester United star is looked up to in the dressing room while showing the relevant leadership skills.

'He [Rooney] is great, Wilshere said. 'Even before he was made captain I looked up to him. He is a leader, a personality and is not scared to tell you when you are doing something wrong.

'I look forward to playing for him. He is the perfect choice for us. He was thrown into the scene at Everton, like me when I was young, and he has had a fantastic career and scored so many goals.

'He is the stand-out choice for me. He was always vocal but now he is putting his arm around us youngsters and having a word with us.'

Wilshere's form has also come under scrutiny in the early stages of the campaign following mediocre showings for Arsenal, but the 22-year-old is convinced he can retain his England place alongside Jordan Henderson following the retirement of Frank Lampard and Gerrard.

'I played with Jordan [Henderson] for a few years, under 21 level, and I always worked well with him. He is so fit and really gets up the pitch well. He has high quality.

'It was disappointing that Gerrard and Lampard retired but that is the level we want to get to. There is also Fabian [Delph] and [Jack] Colback – there is a good battle going on. 

'It is a big season for me and I have had a good pre-season for the first time in a few years. I played every game apart from Leicester and I am feeling strong and stronger every game. I feel as though where I want to be.'

As well as praising his England team-mates, Wilshere was also excited over Arsenal's deadline day dealing to sign Danny Welbeck, a player the Gunners midfielder believes will play big role for the north London outfit.

'He has great enthusiasm, has great quality on the ball. A lot of people do not give him credit technically. He is a great asset for Arsenal. There were a few clubs wanting his signature.'
