Disgraced teacher James Hooker, 42, and his teenage lover made a brief court appearance today for his pretrial hearing on a charge of sexual misconduct with a minor.Â 

Jordan Powers, 18, held her former teacher's hand in the Modesto courtroom after being reunited following a public break-up last month.

Hooker was arrested for oral copulation with a minor he taught at a California school in the 1990s, causing Miss Powers to fly home to Ohio and move back in with her mother.

Grabbing attention: Jordan Powers, 18, and her 41-year-old boyfriend James Hooker face the media as they arrive at court in Modesto today for his pre-trial hearing on a sexual misconduct charge

The pair appeared this morning at Stanislaus County Superior Court for less than a minute where Judge Thomas Zeff scheduled Hooker to return to court on June 12. He was allowed to leave on $50,000 bail.

Jordan had left Hooker after his arrest on April 6 over the sex charge which dates from 1998. The alleged victim says she had a sexual relationship with Hooker when she was 17  after they met at a business club event, the subject which he taught.

Police said the alleged victim came forward after Hooker's relationship with Jordan Powers gained national attention.

According to officers, the case stems from a 1998 relationship he had with a 17-year-old student from Davis High School in Modesto.

After the arrest, Miss Powers said she had moved out of Hooker's apartment.

However her mother Tammie Powers confirmed last month that her daughter left her Ohio home to return to Hooker.

Ms Powers wrote on her Facebook page that Hooker 'has been relentless in contacting and talking to Jordan, as well as inflicting stress on all of my children'.

She added: 'James, you have primarily dealt with the very, very, sick version of Jordan's mother -- I am getting stronger daily - do you hear me? Leave this kid and this family alone.'

The investigation into the 1998 incident began after Hooker announced his relationship in February with Miss Powers, whom he taught at Enochs High School in Modesto.

Hooker had moved in with the teen in February - the same day he quit his job in the school's business department.

The teacher told police he had left his wife and their three daughters the previous week.

Miss Powers' mother, Tammie, had confronted the couple on Dr Phil and accused Hooker of brainwashing her daughter.

Troubling: The arrest relates to the alleged sexual abuse of a different student at a separate school in 1998

Where it all began: James Hooker quit his job at Enochs High School in Modesto - where one of his daughters, 17, is a student and where he met his teenage lover - so he could be with Jordan
