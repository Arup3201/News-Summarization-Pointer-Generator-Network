A warrior beetle lived up to its name when it was recorded dispatching a devil scorpion with little effort.

A man placed the two creatures into a container to show what happens they face off, warning viewers that the invertebrate would feed on its natural prey.

After feeling out their environment, the combatants lock horns in battle to the death.

Sensing its predator the scorpion turns and tries to make a run for it.

But the beetle steamrolls forward and is undeterred by its competitor’s sting.

It dives at the scorpion's tail and clamps on with its powerful pincers.

Chasing the scorpion around the container, the beetle maintains its grip on the tail and hangs from it as its competitor attempts to make a getaway.

Despite the scorpion turning and attempting to fend off the beetle on a number of occasions, the outcome is inevitable and eventually it starts to slow down.

Releasing the tail – now bent and crooked – the beetle jumps on the scorpion’s right pincer before returning to the tail and chopping it in half.

According to the video's creator, warrior beetles, known scientifically as Pasimachus californicus, eat devil scorpions in the wild.

Both are inhabitants of the Sonora Desert of the American Southwest, and the devil scorpion is considered a pest species in Arizona as it often enters homes and stings the occupants.

Despite its nasty sting however, the beetle’s strong armour is impervious to it.
