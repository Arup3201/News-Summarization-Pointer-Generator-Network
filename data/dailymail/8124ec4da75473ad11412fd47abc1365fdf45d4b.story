A teenager from Tennessee has miraculously regained the ability to walk again - just six weeks after being diagnosed with a rare spinal disease that could have paralaysed her for life.

15-year-old Jessica Shainburg woke up one morning in January to discover she could not feel anything below her waist, according to an ABC report. 

Doctors diagnosed her with a disorder which causes the spine to inflame known as transverse myelitis - and said it could be permanent if she was not walking within six weeks.

The chances of that happening were less than one in three but incredibly, Jessica recovered in time thanks to another rare disorder in her brain that catalysed her recovery.

Jessica from Nashville told WKRN-TV: 'I'm so blessed and lucky to be able to be walking again.'

A few days before she completely lost the use of her legs, she claimed to experience some tingling in her lower limbs but the emergency room doctors could not find anything serious and sent her home.

Even her father Jeff did not believe her at first and told Jessica: 'You gotta wake your legs up and we got to go to school.'

A few days earlier, Jessica said she felt a tingling in her legs, but emergency room doctors found no signs of anything serious and sent her home, said her father. 

She was eventually diagnosed with a disorder which inflames the spinal cord called transverse myelitis.

Jessica surpassed all doctor's expectations during the weeks of rehabilitation at Scottish Rite Hospital, according to her father.

After her recover, he said: 'It's a miracle... Every day she's getting better and stronger. 

'She just always had a great attitude and was willing to do the work with the therapist. They loved her attitude and they wanted to work with her continuously.'

The doctors at the hospital in Atlanta, Georgia also discovered Jessica had signs of a rare inflammation of the brain known as Acute Disseminated Encephalomyelitis (ADEM).

Recovery: Jeff said the healthcare professionals at Scottish Rite Hospital 'loved her attitude and they wanted to work with her continuously'

They believe it is this second disorder which explains her rapid return to health as patients with ADEM tend to have quicker recovery rates.

Jeff Shainburg added: 'The doctors didn't expect her to recover like that... They were so impressed with her rehab. They hadn't seen a patient like this in a while.'

He says Jessica - who is still too weak to return to her High School studies - has a personal walker and wheelchair which she only uses when she has been standing for long periods of time.  

While the teen is likely to start school in a few weeks, doctors are keeping a close eye on her as she recovers. 

If the rare symptoms reappear, there is a chance it could be a sign of multiple sclerosis.
