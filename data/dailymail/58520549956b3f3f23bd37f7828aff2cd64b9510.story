Ever had so much chest hair you  didn't know what to do with it?

Here's the answer - courtesy of a star stylist who is sculpting world monuments on his clients' torsos.

Daniel Johnson has turned his talents from cutting the England football team's hair to trimming Stonehenge, Sydney harbour and the Great Pyramid of Giza into men's upper body shag.

Tuft job: Wiltshire's amonument Stonehenge is now available in chest hair form thanks to the bizarre 'manscaping' antics of top stylist Daniel Johnson, from London

Bushy: Each design by the 32-year-old stylist took two and a half hours to create - but how do the Great Pyramid and Sphynx of Giza match up to the real thing?

Coiffed: The New York city skyline was one of the most difficult, requiring four types of grooming device and more than 150 individual incisions into the volunteer's hair

The 32-year-old was inspired to create his bizarre designs by a trend sweeping social media which saw men shaving their chest hair into the shape of bikinis.

But he insisted his efforts were considerably more complicated.

Each challenge took two and a half hours, required four types of shaving tools and up to 176 individual 'incisions'.

He also forged the Manhattan skyline, which he said was one of his most difficult 'manscaping' achievements to date.

The challenge left the hair at five different lengths - 0mm, 1mm, 2mm, 5mm and 15mm - but it was a tough task because the hair was so short and curly compared to that found on the men's heads.

Furry talented: The designs include Sydney harbour with its world-famous opera house - and there's even a 'reflection' which has remained to signify the water

In action: Stylist Daniel Johnson, 32, has worked with the England football team, boy bands on The X Factor, former N-Dubz singer Dappy and footballer Mario Balotelli

Mr Johnson said: 'It was a challenge due to how the hair is formed and how it reacts to even the most precise shavers'. Whether the trend will spread remains to be seen

'Creating such intricate designs on men's chests was  a challenge, due to how the hair is formed and how it reacts to even the most precise shavers,' he said.

'I set out to achieve something that made people consider the possibilities of grooming and style and challenged my abilities in order to keep up with the high standards expected from my clients'.

Mr Johnson, whose 'art' was commissioned by the shaving products firm Braun, has styled footballers including Wayne Rooney and Gareth Bale and has appeared in fashion and men's magazines.

He has also done work for the famously mohawked footballer Mario Balotelli alongside N-Dubz singer Dappy and boy bands on The X Factor.

His stunt came after men shaving their  chest hair to form the shape of a woman's bikini top became the latest bonkers trend to hit social media.

Unsettling: The idea sprang from the odd #ChestHairBikini movement on Instagram, which sees men using razors to create exactly what the name suggests

Quite the look: Some #chesthairbikini showcasers appeared, unsurprisingly, to be at bachelor parties and festivals, while others pose solo or take bathroom selfies

Oops: Other participants, however, appeared to be unaware that they were taking part in a social media craze. The odd trend has been around since at least 2012

The origins of the #chesthairbikini Instagram movement are unknown - with some snaps of the bizarre strain of manscaping as long ago as 2012 - but it received widespread coverage last night.

Some #chesthairbikini showcasers appeared, unsurprisingly, to be at bachelor parties and festivals, while others pose solo or take bathroom selfies. 

A poll by a shaving products firm last year claimed more than 70 per cent of men admitted to trimming their body hair, with almost a third taking more than 20 minutes to get the job done.
