A five-year-old boy has been left with horrific injuries after being knocked onto a concrete floor by a middle-aged woman during the post-Christmas shopping frenzy.

Three days after Christmas, Dale Atkinson, 34, was shopping in the middle of a busy Rebel Sport in Macarthur Square Shopping Centre, in South-west Sydney, with his partner and son, Ryan.

'Ryan ran up to me and was crying, and said that someone had bumped into him,' Dale told Daily Mail Australia.

Ryan Atkinson, 5, suffered horrific injuries when he was knocked over by a middle-aged lady in the middle of a Rebel Sports during post-Christmas sales

'I looked at him and couldn't see anything wrong, and told him to shake it off, but then I brushed his hair back and saw a huge lump on his forehead,' Dale said.

Five-year-old Ryan, who had been trailing behind Dale and his partner, had been knocked flat onto the carpet of the store, which thinly covered the concrete underneath that had taken the full force of his little head. 

'He had been playing a game on my phone, which meant that he didn't have his arms free to break his fall,' said Dale, a horticulturalist from Narrelan Vale in NSW.

'I went up to the staff and asked what had happened, and they said that a lady had come up to them at the checkout. She told them that she had bumped into a child and fallen onto him, but that she had just got up and left,' he said.

Ryan's head knocked onto the concrete floor of the store, resulting in a two centimetre raised lump

Ryan's father Dale said that Ryan's mother was so terrified that he'd cracked his skull that they drove 45 minutes away to Wollongong Hospital

'I was just shocked. I was completely mortified that a lady could fall on a child and not even pull up and check whether he was ok, not even apologise.'

'She just got up and left. I don't understand how someone could do that.' 

Dale said that the lump began to swell immediately, blowing up to a raised two centimetre bump which extended from under his nose to around his eyes, covering his forehead.

Ryan had his face painted in the spirit of Christmas festivities, makeup which Dale said melted off with his tears. 

'It just progressively got worse, darkening and swelling until he could barely see out of his eyes,' Dale said.

'The staff at Rebel Sport were amazing, really caring. They ran to get him an ice pack, and lollies, and filed an incident report right away.' 

Ryan's mother, Meg Owen-Maisson, 30, drove her son 45 minutes to Wollongong Hospital to have scans, as 'we thought he might have cracked his skull,' said Dale. 

'Luckily he was physically fine, no broken bones, but I could barely look at him because his injuries were so terrifying.'

Dale and his family are determined to find the woman that knocked over Ryan, and to make her apologise to him for all the harm she caused.

'His mum was bawling her eyes out when she saw him, she's been an absolute wreck,' Dale said. 

'I would just like to find the lady, make her understand what happened to my son,' he said.

'He was so traumatised by it that when we went back the next day to say thank you to the staff I had to carry him into the store because he was afraid he would be knocked over again.'  

Dale said that Rebel Sport had treated the family with utter kindness, launching an investigation and following up on Ryan in the days after the incident to see how he was faring.

'When we went back in they asked him to pick out some toys, and let him have them for free. They've been so caring and that's the one positive thing that has come out of this,' Dale said.

Dale said Ryan had been 'tough as nails', and that despite his injuries was in high spirits

While the staff at Rebel Sport checked CCTV footage in an attempt to identify the woman, the area where the incident happened was in the camera security's blind spot. 

'It's so heartless what she did, she knew what had happened, she reported it to staff, but didn't say anything to him,' Dale said.

'One of my friends started crying when she saw his injuries, and one of my partner's daughters nearly threw up. It brought back memories of being beaten,' he said.

'That's the terrifying thing. I can't believe that injuries my son has reminds someone of being hurt. It looks like I've beaten him, people stare everywhere we go because he looks like a victim of abuse.' 

Dale said Ryan, who turned five on Christmas Eve, had been 'tough as nails', and that despite his injuries was in high spirits.

'It's only when he looks in the mirror and realises that he doesn't look like himself anymore that he gets upset,' said Dale.

'He's still a bit wary and that breaks my heart because it's his birthday party this week. I can't believe he has to celebrate looking the way he does.' 

Dale said that Ryan is a very active boy, who loves running around and has no fear, but that hasn't stopped Dale from feeling scared for his little boy. 

'I'm pretty shaken up about it. Even now it gives me chills, I get teary just talking about it,' Dale said.

'I just can't believe that three days after Christmas someone would do that to a little boy. Where is your spirit? Do you not have compassion?'
