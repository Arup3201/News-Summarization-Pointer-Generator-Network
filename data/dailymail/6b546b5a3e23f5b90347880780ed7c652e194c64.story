When newlyweds Stan and Claudia Gocman settled down to watch a video of their big day they hoped to relive precious memories.

Instead they were greeted with a vile anti-Semitic rant about the bride and their guests after the cameraman accidentally recorded his racist commentary and then forgot to edit it from the tape.

As he filmed the happy couple dancing at the reception, Anthony Aurelius could be heard saying: ‘I don’t think I blame Hitler.’

SCROLL DOWN FOR VIDEO

Offended couple: Stan and Claudia Gocman were blissfully happy to be married but sat down to watch their wedding video and heard the cameraman insulting her and their guests

He also told his unnamed assistant: 
‘Some of the Jewish women are very beautiful to look at. But I can tell 
you, they’d be right f****** cows. Very f****** snooty, they’d be a pain
 in the a***. Not a very attractive bride at all.’

Mr Gocman, 28, a senior recruiter at accountancy firm KPMG, said the video had ruined their memories of the wedding.

His
 wife, a 27-year-old fashion buyer for Ralph Lauren, said: ‘It’s 
completely anti-Semitic and ignorant. Even the assistant, who is Asian, 
was racist. I just don’t understand it.

‘At first, I was really upset but then I was furious. I think he’s a disgusting little man.

‘I can’t even stand to watch the video, it makes me so angry.’

The
 couple married last August at London’s Central Synagogue. They had a 
black tie reception for 150 guests at a hotel near Trafalgar Square and a
 honeymoon in South Africa and Mauritius.

But after the ceremony, Mr Aurelius initially sent them a video of the wrong wedding.

Oblivious: Offensive videographer Anthony Aurelius called Mrs Gocman 'unattractive' and female guests 'f****** cows' unaware it was picked up by the microphone

Terrible comments: During dancing at the reception the cameraman said: 'Mental, Israeli dancing, isn't it? There's a real feeling of like, they're better than everybody else. Jewish.'

Note: Anthony Aurelius sent this grovelling apology to the couple who say it completely ruined memories of their wedding day

Grand: Jewish couple Stan and Claudia Gocman were married in the heart of of London but they day has been marred by a man who said he didn't blame Hitler for the Holocaust

When
 Mrs Gocman complained it took the cameraman nine months to send the 
right one, but it had key moments missing and more shots of guests’ 
backs than their faces.

As a
 result. the couple, of Edgware, north London, agreed to pay extra for 
the unedited version. But when it arrived they were horrified to find 
the soundtrack littered with derogatory comments.

In
 it, Mr Aurelius remarks: ‘Mental, Israeli dancing, isn’t it? There’s a 
real feeling of like, they’re better than everybody else. Jewish.’

His assistant replies: ‘That’s why Holocaust.’ Mr Aurelius responds: ‘I don’t think I blame Hitler.’

He
 had earlier accidentally left the camera running in the back seat of 
his car as he followed the wedding party from the synagogue to the hotel
 where the reception was taking place.

As
 well as shots of streetlamps as they make their way through the 
capital, Mr Aurelius is heard telling his assistant that Jews think 
‘they’re better than everybody else because they’re from Israel. Not a 
lot of niceness about them is there? Very little warmth’.

His assistant adds: ‘They are the meanest people in the world, I know very well.’

Throughout
 the unedited clips, Mr Aurelius moans about how the couple spent more 
on photographers and chose only his £600 ‘bronze’ video deal.

‘They paid big money for photography, but not for video,’ he says.

‘When
 someone pays you a lot of money, you feel like you want to work hard 
for them.’ Mr Gocman said: ‘He thought we were a lot more wealthy than 
we are and he resented that.

‘I would think that, in this day and age, someone, who had done Jewish weddings in the past, would be more accepting.’

Other career: Anthony Aurelius also claims to be the UK's No 1 fitness expert and has had a DVD

Email: The cameraman has said that the incident has made him consider how he lives his life and apologised again for any offence he caused

In
 an email to Mr Aurelius, Mrs Gocman said the video had ‘completely 
ruined the memories of our day’ when all they wanted was a simple 
‘documentation’.

‘What we 
got were two cameramen who clearly couldn’t be bothered to even be 
there, who disappeared for a long period throughout the evening and 
missed key footage,’ she wrote.

Mr
 Aurelius, who has previously marketed himself as a karate expert, gave 
the couple a full refund and wrote a grovelling letter to Mrs Gocman in 
which he said he needed to ‘look at myself’.

He
 also sent an email saying: ‘I am very sorry for our stupid, childish 
conversation. I am also very sorry for offending you and possibly your 
family also.

‘You did not deserve this. I am ashamed, in honesty.

‘I have felt awful about this and did not know what to say, in truth.

‘We
 know, in truth, very little about what went on in the war. To be deeply
 honest, I respect your strength as a culture from coming back from 
this. I am trying to walk a good life, but in this instance I failed 
very badly in God’s eyes.’

Mr Aurelius could not be contacted for comment.
