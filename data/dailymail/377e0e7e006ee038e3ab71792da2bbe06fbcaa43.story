A British Jihadi who claims he is fighting alongside militants in Syria has said he will return to the UK when he sees 'the black flag of Islam' hanging over Buckingham Palace.

The man, who called himself Abu Osama, said he had been taking part in military training, making bombs and 
fighting with the extremist Al-Nusra Front, which is linked to al Qaida,
 for the past year.

Osuma, whose accent suggested he comes from 
the north of England, claimed to have been fighting for the 
establishment of a caliphate - which he referred to by the Arabic term 
Khilafah - across the Islamic world.

He told BBC 5 Live's Nicky Campbell: 'There is nothing in 
Britain - it is just pure evil.

'If
 and when I come back to Britain it will be when this Khilafah - this 
Islamic state - comes to conquer Britain and I come to raise the black 
flag of Islam over Downing Street, over Buckingham Palace, over Tower 
Bridge and over Big Ben.'

But he added: 'I have no intention of coming 
back to Britain, because I have come to revive the Islamic Khilafah. I 
don't want to come back to what I have left behind.

Osuma said he initially faced opposition from his family over his 
decision to go to Syria,saying: 'At first it was hard for them to accept, 
because no mother wants to lose her son.

'But I send them photos and I 
speak to them about the situation, and now they can understand that this
 is a good cause I am in.

'They are a bit scared but I tell them we will meet in the afterlife. This is just a temporary separation.

'They said, "We understand now what you are doing", and my mother said, "I have sold you to Allah. I don't want to see you again in this world".'

The comments were broadcast as religious leaders called on British Muslims not to travel to Syria and Iraq, amid fears of jihadis fleeing the country to take part in terrorism.

An open letter signed by more than 100 imams from across major theological backgrounds has urged British Muslim communities 'to continue the generous and tireless effort to support all of those affected by the crisis in Syria and unfolding events in Iraq', but to do so 'from the UK in a safe and responsible way'.

The comments come after Britons Reyaad Khan and Nasser Muthana appeared in this Isis recruitment video earlier this month encouraging others to fight

The
 imams' open letter read: 'As the crisis in Syria and Iraq deepens, we 
the under-signed have come together as a unified voice to urge the 
British Muslim communities not to fall prey to any form of sectarian 
divisions or social discord.

'Ramadan,
 the month of mercy, teaches us the value of unity and perseverance and 
we urge the British Muslim communities to continue the generous and 
tireless efforts to support all of those affected by the crisis in Syria
 and unfolding events in Iraq, but to do so from the UK in a safe and 
responsible way.'

Another British jihadist fighting for Isis in Syria sent his friends this chilling picture of home-made bombs - and warned that the UK government should be 'afraid' about him returning home

The letter comes during the Islamic festival of Ramadan, but against a troubling backdrop of tensions between the Middle East and the west.

The situation has been underlined by US officials who have stepped up security precautions amid reports that two terror networks are working together on a bomb that could evade existing measures.

Concerns have also been raised about homegrown involvement in terrorism after Britons appeared in a propaganda video for insurgent group Islamic State in Iraq and Greater Syria (Isis).

Among them was aspiring jihadi Aseel Muthana, who told the BBC he was fighting in Syria and had no intention of returning to the UK.

His brother Nasser appeared with two other British men - 20-year-old Reyaad Khan, from Cardiff, and Abdul Raqib Amin, who grew up in Aberdeen.

In April, the Metropolitan Police issued a plea for people to come forward with information about their family members if they were concerned about them joining terrorist training camps in Syria.

Qari Mohammed Asim, imam at Leeds Makka Mosque, who played a key role in organising the new letter, said: 'The scale of the humanitarian disaster in Syria and the escalating violence in Iraq calls for an unprecedented response.

'As we near the end of the first week of Ramadan our message is simple - we have come together to urge British Muslim communities not to fall prey to any form of sectarian divisions or social discord.

'Here in the UK we are Sunnis and Shias, brothers in Islam - and brothers in Britain too. The conflict in Syria and Iraq can never change that, no matter how bitter the fighting.

'We urge members of the community to echo this sentiment by adding their signature to this letter, joining the many others that have done so already.'
