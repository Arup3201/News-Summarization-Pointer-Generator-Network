Manchester City striker Edin Dzeko is confident his side can beat Arsenal this weekend to get their title challenge back on course.

City lost their last game before the international break 1-0 to Stoke, and want to send a strong message to their title rivals by beating Arsenal at the Emirates Stadium on Saturday.

And Dzeko believes his side can take the initiative against a club he believes can challenge for the title. 

Title challenge: Dzeko knows that there will be several teams hoping to knock City off top spot

'[The Arsenal game] will be difficult but I'm an optimist,' he told the Manchester City official website.

'This season Chelsea might be the most serious challenger but we mustn't ignore Liverpool, Tottenham, Arsenal, or [Manchester] United, who will certainly be much stronger than last year. After all, everyone has got stronger and everyone wants to be first.'

Dzeko was a key part of City's title winning squad last season, and committed to a new four-year contract over the summer.  

'The past season was one of the best in my career, and in the end we reached the title of champions of England, the second in the past three seasons,' the 28-year old said.

Agonising: Manuel Pellegrini's side were not at their best in the narrow defeat to Stoke last week

Shooting boots: Dzeko will want to rediscover his form against Arsenal, having not yet scored this season

'We succeeded in winning the Capital One Cup and I am really happy how everything played out in the past season, both for the club and for myself.

'As far as the contract, in general I had no dilemma around an extension.

'I am happy at City, the manager believes in me, which is certainly important, and I give my all on the pitch and altogether it means quite a lot to me, because City is a club with great ambitions and I easily decided to stay put.'
