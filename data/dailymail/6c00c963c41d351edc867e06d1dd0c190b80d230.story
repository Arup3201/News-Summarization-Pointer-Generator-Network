Santa Claus is going to be busy in the Turner home this year... as there are four extra names on his 'good' list.

Nine-month-old 70million-to-one quads James, Joshua, Lauren and Emily will be celebrating their first Christmas.

The two sets of identical twins will be at the centre of the special, if not a bit chaotic, festive period for proud parents Sharon and Julian Turner.

The two sets of identical twins will be at the centre of the special, if not a bit chaotic, festive period for proud parents Sharon and Julian Turner at their home in Upper Lambourn, Berks

The quads are thriving and full of smiles despite their early births at just 29 weeks in March this year and are set to have a magical Christmas surrounded by the family who wanted them so much.

Each baby has their very own named stocking already waiting at the fireside waiting for Father Christmas to fill it with gifts.

Although presents and a festive dinner will feature in the special day, they will take second place to the babies feeding and sleeping routines.

'It will be a very special first Christmas,' said proud mum Sharon.

'We will be having presents and will just about manage to fit in a Christmas lunch when they have their afternoon sleep.

'But they are the first priority and the feeding and sleeping has to go on as usual. We just have to get on with it.'

The 38-year-old is delegating the cooking of Christmas dinner to 44-year-old Julian and reflects on the difference just one year makes.

'I can’t image life without the children now. I wouldn’t change it for anything,' she added.

The couple have help from Sharon’s mother, Sandra, who has moved into a newly built extension of their home in Upper Lambourn, Berkshire, and students studying at a nearby college.

As the four are getting bigger by the day - they weighed between 2lb 4oz and 2lb 6oz at birth - it is getting easier for their parents to tell them apart, particularly with their personalities shining through.

Born within four minutes of each other, the eldest James is laid back and the calmest of the clan.

His brother, next in line to be born, is the chatty one and 'the most adventurous', who will be the first to crawl and walk the family predicts.

Of the girls, Lauren is the quietest baby with Emily the noisiest who wants to see everything that is going on.

The Christmas decorations have been put up but take second place to the enormous amount of equipment the family needs to deal with four completely dependent babies.

And they know that it will be relatively quiet before next Christmas - when the four will all be crawling and walking.
