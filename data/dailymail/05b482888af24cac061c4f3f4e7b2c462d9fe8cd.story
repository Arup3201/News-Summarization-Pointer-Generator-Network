Doctors are calling for an end to the prescribing of gluten-free foods on the health service.

The 50-year-old practice is stuck in a ‘time warp’ and forces GPs to behave like grocers, it is claimed.

Prescriptions for gluten-free food cost £27million a year in England – some of which could be better spent on medication for the seriously ill, says GP Dr James Cave, editor of the independent review of medical treatment, the Drug and Therapeutics Bulletin.

Critic: Dr James Cave, editor of the Drug and Therapeutics Bulletin, called for an end to gluten-free prescriptions, saying they were introduced when the foods were not widely available in shops

Mr Cave wants the system to be overhauled, writing in a magazine editorial with deputy editor David Phizackerley.

Gluten-free foods are prescribed to those with coeliac disease, an auto-immune condition triggered by gluten, a protein in wheat, rye and barley.

The DTB editorial says prescriptions were introduced before the foods became widely available in shops.

Dr Cave said the NHS must find a better way to support coeliac patients, possibly with vouchers for gluten-free foods.

Gluten can be found in cakes, biscuits, pasta, beer and bread, as well as in a wide range of products from soy sauce to fish fingers, and mayonnaise to baked beans.

The cost of buying gluten free foods without the help of prescriptions can be ‘prohibitive’ for patients, with the products up to 500 per cent higher than the ‘normal’ equivalents.

Better use: Dr Cave said some of the money that is used for gluten-free prescriptions, which cost £27million every year in England, could be used on medication to treat serious illnesses

A small loaf can cost around £3, a pack of crumpets £1.70 and a cake £3.

But the prescribing system is outmoded and costly, adding a layer of unnecessary red tape to the NHS which takes up healthcare professionals’ time and is unhelpful to patients, the editorial says.

Dr Cave said the current system racks up costs at every level, from dispensing fees paid to pharmacists to charges made by wholesalers, and can be inefficient for patients waiting for their orders to arrive.

Dr Cave’s own GP practice includes a pharmacy which allows him to see where the savings can be made, he added.

He said ‘Sometimes I have to act more like a grocer than a GP when the orders come in and the food stacks up.

‘It’s an antiquated system stuck in a time warp which works like an old-fashioned cartel, but it’s NHS money and budgets for cancer and other drugs are under pressure.’

Some trusts will no longer authorise prescribing of gluten free cakes and sweet biscuits because it doesn’t promote healthy eating.

Gluten free foods have a unit value - for example 400g bread equals one unit - and male coeliac patients are entitled to 18 units a month, with women getting 14 units.

Dr Cave said he did not want to see the NHS stop helping coeliac patients, as the financial burden for the ‘vulnerable’ might be considerable.

‘But it is time to consider the use of food vouchers that could be redeemed against gluten-free foods at any outlet so the supply of food would no longer be a medical issue’ he added.

The charity Coeliac UK said support was needed as gluten free foods can can cost much more than regular foods and are often not available in budget or convenience stores relied upon by those on low incomes, the elderly, disabled or those living in remote rural areas.

Sarah Sleet, Chief Executive of Coeliac UK said ‘Following a gluten-free diet enables patients to live a full and healthy life. However, to do so, it is crucial that they are able to access basic gluten-free foods, such as bread, flour and pasta, which are the staples in all our diets.

‘If you are elderly, on low incomes or have mobility problems there is a gap because such foods are likely to be inaccessible. They cost too much or can’t be found in the shops you can get to.

'Prescriptions are providing an essential service for these vulnerable groups.’

She said the charity is willing to consider any scheme, including vouchers, which continues to support the vulnerable and for new ways to cut red tape.

She said: ‘People with coeliac disease would ideally like to shop for their food like everyone else. If we can address the cost and availability issues in retail shops there would not be a need for prescriptions.

‘In the meantime, we agree that we need to find the most cost effective way to support patients. This is why we have promoted a pharmacy supply scheme which is proven to reduce costs and save GP time.

‘Such schemes are already up and running in England and an all Scotland scheme has been reported as being on the cards.’
