Moral stature: Jessica Ennis-Hill said Ched Evans should not be re-signed by Sheffield United because football players should 'set a good example'

Jessica Ennis-Hill is a remarkable woman. She is the reigning Olympic heptathlon champion and the finest all-round female athlete this country has produced. 

And in a glittering international career spanning a decade, she has never uttered a contentious word nor expressed a controversial opinion. 

Until last week that is, when she announced that she wanted her name removed from a stand named after her by Sheffield United, if the club offers a contract to the convicted rapist Ched Evans.

‘Those in positions of influence should respect the role they play in young people’s lives and set a good example,’ she said. 

‘If Evans was to be re-signed by the club it would completely contradict these beliefs.’ 

The view was simply stated, yet the effect was devastating. In the space of two sentences, she seemed to have ended all speculation that the rapist would be allowed to carry on collecting £20,000 a week for playing professional football in Sheffield.

Evans was released from prison in October, having served two-and-a-half years of a five-year sentence for raping an intoxicated 19-year-old woman. 

His victim, whose identity was revealed on social media, has suffered vicious abuse, has been forced to leave her home town, and change her identity. 

More than 157,000 people signed a petition urging the club not to take back the player.

Now, if Evans had been a mundane performer, then he would have been sacked with a great show of lofty disapproval. But he is not mundane – he is their star, a man who is worth a lot of money. So the club did nothing, and waited for the initial storm to abate. They then, discreetly, allowed him to resume training.

There were strong arguments on both sides. Many believed Evans had served his time and should be allowed to resume his profession; others thought his offence too heinous for easy forgiveness, and cited the fact that he had shown neither a scrap of remorse for his offence, nor sympathy for his victim. But Jessica’s intervention may well prove decisive, for she enjoys the moral stature of one who represents something decent in sport and in society. Football can make no such claim.

Pretentiously, it calls itself ‘the beautiful game’. Rarely can beauty have seemed so morally repugnant.

The popular cliche suggests the game is played by a posse of sexual predators, managed by a gaggle of garrulous chancers and controlled by owners whose financial backgrounds might not withstand intensive scrutiny. It is an exaggeration, but it contains an element of truth. 

Awash with money at its higher levels, football has developed a disturbing sense of entitlement. ‘I want, I can afford, therefore I must have’ is the mantra.

The statistics are startling. The average Premier League player’s salary is £2.3million per year. These physically gifted, sparsely educated men earn almost 60 per cent more than their contemporaries in Germany, home of the current world champions.

Star players at clubs such as Manchester United, Manchester City and Chelsea are paid between £4million and £5million a year.

But then the Premier League clubs pick up an average of £155million per season from a £1billion a year television contract, as well as the massive overseas rights. Most of this finds its way back to the players, which is as it should be.

Far less palatable is the largesse skimmed off by agents – odious leeches who contribute little to the game yet plundered almost £97million last year.

Ennis-Hill said she wanted her name removed from the stand at Bramall Lane if Evans was re-signed

Time was when clubs were owned by landed gentry or local businessmen who’d made their pile and wanted to make their mark. Today it’s oil-rich sheiks or oligarchs with fortunes of mysterious provenance.

All has changed, and the general sense of opulence now extends even to the boardroom of the Football Association.

In the summer, at the World Cup in Brazil, the FA chairman Greg Dyke was presented with a gift bag by the Brazilian FA. He brought it home and left it in a corner of his study. He was later informed it contained a £16,400 Parmigiani watch. Dyke was shocked, and confessed he had received half a dozen watches in his year at the FA.

Mercifully, the era of racial or homophobic insults is fading, but the raucous filth of the chanting is something which continues to shock. 

I recall Harry Redknapp, when manager of Spurs, enduring a disgraceful afternoon at Villa Park.

Redknapp, who is not an unworldly man, later spoke with disgust at the insults which players and managers are required to endure from foul-mouthed dullards. 

Despite bid leaders knowing England did not stand a chance of being given hosting rights for the 2018 World Cup, Prince William, David Beckham and David Cameron were sent to FIFA headquarters in Zurich

‘And some of them have their children with them,’ he said. ‘Young kids, watching their fathers make those evil gestures and scream those words. If they did it in the street, they’d be arrested. Why should football grounds be different?’

Last week’s revelations from FIFA on the report into corruption were unquestionably damaging to the game’s tainted image, yet the prevailing reaction was of scorn.

World football’s governing body is institutionally unscrupulous, so much so that it scarcely troubles to deny the fact. It is also miserably incompetent. Thus it could commission an investigation into the scandal of the World Cup bidding process for the 2018 and 2022 tournaments, and then, when the probe failed to deliver the required whitewash, order a ‘precis’ of the report which flatly contradicted the original document.

But the English FA had no cause for disdain, following the spectacular shambles of its own 2010 World Cup bid, when trumpets were sounded and the starry trio of Prince William, David Beckham and David Cameron were dispatched to Zurich to help plead the English cause.

Privately, as some of us had discovered, the bid leaders knew beyond doubt that England hadn’t the remotest chance of success. 

But that didn’t stop the FA’s shameless wooing of disgraced FIFA executive Jack Warner, with a job offer for one of his pals and a £35,000 dinner that sticks in the craw. And they allowed the prince, the PM and the nation’s favourite son to humiliate themselves by seeking votes from the rascals. It was a repellent spectacle.

And yet, at its best, football has much to offer. It can captivate and beguile. It can enthuse the young, enthral the old and ignite the imagination of those who have followed it so faithfully. 

But the sad old game has not been at its best for some time. It was never so wealthy, never so widely watched, yet never so little loved. 

Desperately, it seeks a clear, resonant voice, one which articulates the values it used to embrace. And last week it gained such a voice in Jessica Ennis-Hill. We must hope it finds the wit to listen.
