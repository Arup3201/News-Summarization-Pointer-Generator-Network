Footballer Mario Balotelli has taken his new £200,000 white Ferrari for a spin on a go kart track. 

Balotelli, 22, is well known for his love of karting but is forbidden by his contract with AC Milan to drive mini karts in case he gets an injury. 

But he satisfied his need for speed after convincing bosses at a track to let him take the gleaming Ferrari 450 out for a few high speed circuits.

The AC Milan striker loves karting but is forbidden in his contract from driving karts in case of injury

The former Manchester City star turned up at the Pala K karting complex on the outskirts of Milan with a group of pals.

There was no sign of his former girlfriend Fanny Neguesha, who he split with last week despite claiming she 'was the one'.

He bought the top-of-the-range sports car to console himself after the break up.

The striker spent almost an hour at the club speeding through the curves and chicanes of the 600 metre track in his Ferrari as his pals cheered him on from the stands. The group then left for a bite to eat.

Balotelli, who had a go kart track built in the garden of his Cheshire home when he was at Manchester City, is a regular at the Pala K centre and often visited even when he lived in England.

Pala K owner Joe Ghiringhelli said: 'Mario loves coming here but he's not allowed to race the karts because of his AC Milan contract - they are worried he may injure himself.

'I must say though that we have never had any accidents here so I'm going to write to AC Milan and tell them they have no need to worry about the players using the karts.

'Mario is a regular visitor here and would come over even when he was playing in England - he loves the karts and driving although he said he could never get used to driving in England because over there they drive on the other side of the road.

'We let him take his new Ferrari out on the track and he was roaring around laughing and having fun.'

His visit to the track came ahead of AC Milan's 4-0 win over Pescara with Balotelli bagging a brace taking his tally to 11 goals in as many games.
