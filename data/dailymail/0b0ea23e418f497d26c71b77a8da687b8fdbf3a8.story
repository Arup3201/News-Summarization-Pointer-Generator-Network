The father of a police officer murdered by a one-eyed assassin says he should be hanged.

Dale Cregan, 30, who was told by a judge yesterday that he would spend the rest of his life in prison, was on bail when he gunned down two female police officers in an act of ‘pre-meditated savagery’.

Just weeks after going on the run after killing two gangland rivals, high-living drug dealer Cregan lured WPCs Fiona Bone and Nicola Hughes into a ‘calculated trap’ by reporting a burglary.

And as they walked up the driveway, he emerged from the front door and mowed them both down in a hail of bullets.

He then hurled his ‘calling card’ grenade at the dying officers and drove to the nearest police station to hand himself in.

Last night the family of PC Bone, 32, said Cregan should be hanged.

Her father, Paul Bone, said: ‘One of the problems is when they did away with hanging, in the 60s, we were told life would mean life, now it’s very flexible, or life is a very flexible sentence.’

The brutal slaying of the two officers took the number of policewomen killed in the line of duty to ten and also brought to an end one of the biggest manhunts in British history.

Yesterday, as Cregan was told he will
spend the rest of his life behind bars, for the WPC murders and the 
gangland killings of David Short, 46, and his son Mark, 23, it emerged 
that:

Yesterday
Judge Timothy Holroyde  QC told him: ‘You pursued the officers with 
cold-blooded and ruthless determination to end their lives. You acted 
with pre-meditated savagery. You will never be released from prison.’

Home Secretary Theresa May said: ‘Cregan is a despicable individual. I am pleased he’s been sentenced to spend the rest of his life behind bars.’

Ian Hanson, of the Greater Manchester Police Federation, added: ‘Dale Cregan is an abomination upon our society and in my view he has forfeited the right to walk the streets for the rest of his life.

'I hope that he dies in prison many years from now a sad, lonely old man, having spent decades staring at a cell door, after which he can rot in hell for all eternity.‘

The Chief Constable of Greater Manchester, Sir Peter Fahy, defended the decision to release Cregan on  bail following the first Short murder, saying the force had insufficient  evidence to charge him.

Cregan’s killing spree began after a row in a pub between two rival crime families in Greater Manchester.

In
May last year, the Short family were in the Cotton Tree pub in 
Droylsden, Manchester. Last orders had been called when Cregan – wearing
a balaclava – entered the room and fired seven shots, hitting Mark 
Short and three other men.

In August, David Short was at home when Cregan and accomplice Anthony Wilkinson turned up armed to the teeth.

Firing at will they chased him through the house and out into the garden, hitting him numerous times before finally throwing a grenade.

The couple who were held hostage in their own home by killer Cregan have spoken of their terror as he gunned down two policewomen outside their house.

It was on Alan Whitwell and his partner Lisa McIntosh’s driveway that Cregan shot victims Nicola Hughes and Fiona Bone.

‘I saw the gun in his hand, and he mumbled something about the police,’ Alan, 34, told The Sun.

‘I heard the front door open and then just head “Bam!” The shots seemed to go on forever.’

The barber from Hattersley, Greater Manchester, who had met Dale Cregan a few times through mutual friends, describes his horror when he saw Cregan pull the pin out of a grenade and throw it back towards the house, saying it was ‘like a scene from Terminator’.

‘There was blood everywhere, I wanted to be sick.’Cregan had turned up at the house the night before the brutal murders demanding a haircut from barber Alan.

Mistaking him for a colleague, Alan let the killer inside after which Cregan threatened him with the grenade.

The murders of Nicola Hughes and Fiona Bone came after Alan, Lisa and her seven-year-old daughter had been held hostage for 12 hours.

The grenade caused ‘devastating’ injuries to Mr Short’s torso and he died instantly. Cregan fled and a massive manhunt was launched.

On September 18, police received a phone call reporting a burglary at a house in a quiet cul-de-sac in Hattersley, Greater Manchester.

Using the name Adam Gartree, Cregan said a man had thrown a concrete slab through his window and run off. When the call handler told him someone would investigate the matter, he replied: ‘I’ll be waiting.’

WPCs Bone and Hughes, who were both unarmed, were sent to investigate the call, but as they approached the house the front door opened and they were confronted by Cregan.

Protected by their body armour, neither officer was initially injured but they were soon mown down in the hail of 32 bullets. Just 31 seconds after arriving at the house, both officers lay dead or dying.

After handing himself in, Cregan was asked whether he had any weapons on him. He replied: ‘I dropped the gun at the scene and I’ve murdered two police officers.’

Cregan had 17 previous convictions – many for violence – stretching back to 2000. He hardly saw his father, Paul, a tool setter, who left the family when Cregan was a boy and, ironically, set up home with police officer Deborah Tanswell.

Not long after leaving Littlemoss High School in Droylsden, Cregan took to drug dealing and boasted of earning up to £20,000 a week. He drove a Mercedes Jeep and enjoyed business-class flights and holidays in the West Indies and the Far East.

Of Cregan’s associates, Wilkinson, 34, was jailed for a minimum of 35 years; Luke Livesey, 28, Damian Gorman, 38, and Jermaine Ward, 24, to a minimum of 33 years; and Mohammed Imran Ali, 32, to seven years for assisting an offender.
