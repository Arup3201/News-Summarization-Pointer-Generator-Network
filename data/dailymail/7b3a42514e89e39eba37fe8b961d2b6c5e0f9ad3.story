Supermarkets have begun a new fuel price war after Sainsbury's announced it will slash the cost of diesel and petrol by up to 5p a litre from tomorrow.

Asda quickly followed suit, announcing it will also cut 1p from the price of petrol and 2p from the price of diesel from tomorrow, putting the pressure on other big retailers such as Tesco and Morrisons.

The change in price reflects a drop in the price of wholesale crude oil, and a strengthening of the pound following a no vote in the Scottish referendum.

Sainsbury's has announced it is cutting the price of petrol and diesel by up to 5p a litre from tomorrow, leading to Asda promising a cut of 1p on petrol and 2p on diesel

RAC fuel spokesman Simon Williams said: 'The wholesale price of both petrol and diesel has been low for around three months and as a result motorists have been enjoying some the cheapest prices for over three years.

'This cut will take us to a new low, the likes of which we haven’t seen since late 2010, early 2011 when the price of petrol and diesel unfortunately jumped by 10p a litre in just a few months.

'Since the Scottish referendum the pound has rallied against the dollar which has created a much-appreciated downward pressure on fuel prices which are traded in dollars. 

'It’s great news for motorists that this is being swiftly passed on by retailers at the pumps.'

AA spokesman Luke Bosdet said: 'A 5p cut in the price of petrol, lopping £2.50 off the cost of filling a typical fuel tank, will be particularly welcome as families get back to school runs.'

Inflation fell 1.5 per cent on the consumer price index last month, driven largely by cuts to fuel and food prices in the supermarkets, easing the pressure on squeezed household budgets

The fresh round of price cuts will also come as more good news to Chancellor George Osborne.

Earlier this month it was revealed that inflation dropped 1.5 per cent to a four and a half year low, thanks in large part to supermarket price wars on food and fuel.

It means inflation, measured on the consumer price index (CPI), has been below its target of 2 per cent for eight months in a row - the longest run since before the recession in 2005.

As well as being good news for shoppers, the news may also help those with mortgages and other loans, as it eases pressure on the Bank of England to raise interest rates.

The Bank has set rates at the historic low of 0.5 per cent for more than five years, and analysis believed they may have increased that to 0.75 in February next year.

However, with inflation continuing to fall, that may now be delayed until the second financial quarter of next year, according to IHS Global Insight.
