The man who woke up in a Palm Springs Motel 6 with no memory of his past life, is facing suspicion from doctors and those who knew him before his amnesia.

Michael Boatwright was discovered unconscious in a Motel 6 room in February, but when he awoke he could not remember anything about himself, recognize even his own reflection, nor how to speak English.

When he woke up he believed he was Johan Ek and only spoke in Swedish, a persona that clashes with his Social Security card, passport and the veteran's medical card he was carrying.

Faking it? More friends have come forward saying they knew Boatwright before his amnesia, and they're not buying the story

Who is Michael Boatwright? The man above woke up in a Palm Springs Motel 6 with no memory of his past life -  only speaking Swedish and responding to 'Johan Ek'

Doctors at Desert Regional Medical Center diagnosed Boatwright on March 13 as having transient global amnesia, but experts say there is no way to prove if he actually suffers from the disorder.

Skeptical: Gifford Searls knew Boatwright back in China, and helped the man get back to the U.S. before his visa expired. He's not sure if the amnesia is real

But more is coming to light about Boatwright's life just prior to losing his memory.

Gifford Searls met Boatwright in the first half of 2012 when they were both working as teachers in Zhuhai, China.

Searls works at United International College, and Boatwright was then an English teacher at the TPR English school.

They both loved tennis,  and often met up to play on weekends.

Searls says Boatwright was a very good tennis player, spoke flawless English and seemed to be healthy.

He says everyone found Boatwright to be an 'affable, energetic guy' and didn't seem to show any signs of past trauma - something doctors say sets off the amnesia.

'There was no inkling of any deep personal issues. He never talked about money. He didn't talk much about his past life,' Searls told The Desert Sun. 'And then there was this one Friday night where I get a phone call.'

Boatwright was in trouble. All Searls could make out over the phone was his friend whispering for help.

So he showed up at Boatwright's home with his wife and two other friends and found that the man they knew was living in a 'hovel' - a single-room basement apartment that had no bathroom.

Boatwright was inside and unconscious with a glass of vodka and half a vial of animal tranquilizers next to him.

He was rushed to the hospital and treated, eventually being released into his friend's care.

During his time at Searls' house, Boatwright talked about his ex-wife in Japan, and how he had been 'cut off' from their son.

Baffling: Michael Boatwright is pictured here with two women - one who is believed to be his wife and a little boy thought to be his son

Boatwright admitted that he couldn't go back to his job at the school and didn't know where to go next - his visa was set to expire.

The TPN English school confirmed that Boatwright  quit in January and that he had an ex-wife in Japan.

So Searls came up with an idea to send Boatwright to Palm Springs, California to look for a job as a tennis instructor.

He had contacts at a local Marriott where Boatwright could try and get a job.

Searls paid for Boatwright's one-way flight and gave his friend $400 to start a new life.

Lost: A picture of Boatwright in China failed to jog his memory

Boatwright left China on February 24, the last day of his visa, and that was the last time that Searls heard from his friend.

Searls' experiences with Boatwright just before he lost his memory shed light on what might have caused the man to subconsciously - or consciously - erase his old life.

Doctors say there's no way to prove whether Boatwright actually suffers from amnesia, or if it's something he's making up.

According to James Brandt, the director of the Division of Medical Psychology at Johns Hopkins University, only a few of these cases happen a year and they are almost always met with doubt.

Relief: Michael Boatwright uses exercise as the only way to concentrate his mind and not think about his memory loss

He believes Boatwright suffers from a psychological disorder called 'dissociative amnesia' which causes memory loss when a patient tries to block off a portion of their brain to protect themselves from painful memories.

Skills can be lost as well as languages and Brandt says the memory loss can last months to years.

As doctors 'aren't mind readers' there's no way to no for sure what's going on with Boatwright.

'We just don't know how conscious this is,' Brandt said. 'And unless the person suddenly comes to you and confesses - and says, "I've just been playing you like a song. I've been faking it all along" - unless they say that, you never really know how conscious it is.'

Speaking Swedish: Members of the Swedish community in Palm Springs believe that Boatwright lived in Sweden in the mid-80s

Searls for one, doesn't believe that Boatwright lost his memory.

'I just think here is a guy that has no place to go, is desperate and is broke. If he does this, at least he has a bed and three meals a day,' Searls said. 'He's reached the end of his line. But that's just a personal perception.'

The Swedish-American community in Palm Springs also finds aspects of 'Johan Ek' questionable. 

They've been helping him adjust to his new reality at the Vasa Order of America's Desert Viking Lodge.

After five months of trying to dupe him into speaking English, he hasn't slipped once said his social worker Lisa Hunt-Vasquez.

One
of Boatwright's friends at the Vasa Order, Viola Wyler, does believe 
that Boatwright lived in Sweden during the mid-1980s, but he doesn't 
speak with a regional accent which is strange.

Wyler says this could be because he learned the language later in life, or hasn't used it much during his adult life.

Speaking through a translator with The Desert Sun, Boatwright assures that his amnesia is real, and a living hell.

'Walk in my shoes for one day,' he said. 'You'll experience the nightmare of a lifetime.'
