Shoppers have been warned to avoid fake Frozen dolls after two were found with dangerously high levels of chemicals linked to cancer, birth defects and infertility in men.

The two singing dolls seized in Walsall, West Midlands, were made in China and have excessive levels of phthalates - which help soften plastic but could be carcinogenic in high quantities.

A stallholder who sold the hit film souvenirs is now helping officers trace the supply chain, though they admit they do not yet know how widepread the problem could be.

Let them go! These fake Frozen dolls found in Walsall, West Midlands, have excessive levels of phthalates - chemicals which are used to soften plastic but which have been linked to cancer, birth defects and infertility

The Anna, Elsa and Olaf the snowman toys look almost exactly like their real counterparts, but do not have a Disney logo or a manufacturers' address on the box.

They were being sold on market stalls and over Facebook, and were confirmed as fakes by Disney, Walsall Council said.

Labour councillor Khizar Hussain, cabinet member for community, leisure and culture, said: 'It is pretty much impossible to tell these dolls are counterfeit, just by looking at them.

'But they are potentially very dangerous and I would urge anyone who thinks they may have one to keep them away from children and to get in touch with trading standards for advice.' 

Scientists dispute exactly how harmful to human health phthalates might be, but previous studies have drawn possible links with cancer, birth defects and male infertility.

The chemicals were banned by the EU in 1999 for use in any toys which are designed to be put in the mouths of children under the age of three.

The European Commission warned at the time that putting phthalates in a toddler's mouth could pose a 'serious risk to child health'.

It advised that other affected toys not intended to be put in children's mouths would have to carry a warning label. 

Apart from the part-animated Avatar, Frozen is the most popular animated film ever made and the fifth-highest-grossing film in box office history - with eye-watering takings of £723million.

It tells the story of princess sisters Elsa and Anna, who fall out over Elsa's cryokinetic magical powers.

Although the seized items did not include an Elsa doll, officers said the dolls featured both sisters singing the Oscar-winning song Let It Go and cost around £35, a similar price to the real thing.

Frozen's Snow Glow Elsa was the most in-demand toy in the Christmas rush and many retailers sold out of their entire stock.

The warning is the latest of several about fake Frozen dolls made in the Far East.

In November 426 fake Frozen dolls destined for the UK were part of a haul of almost 2,000 toys seized by border police from a cargo ship arriving from China.

Other local authorities later issued warnings about dangerous toys flooding the black market which could be harmful to children.

These included fake snap bracelets which could slice children's wrists because they were made from metal measuring tape.

One of the largest hauls of fake Frozen goods, in Nottingham, included hundreds of items of clothing and dolls, umbrellas, watches, backpacks and blankets.

None had been subjected to legally required safety tests and trading standards officers warned the clothes could lack fireproofing or pose a strangulation risk.

Gavin Terry, joint lead officer for intellectual property at the Trading Standards Institute, said: 'Counterfeit goods may seem like a bargain but they can be truly dangerous.

'Often untested, poorly made and untraceable, counterfeit Frozen toys could be poisonous, pose a choking hazard or be made of highly flammable material.

'Some seized counterfeit Frozen toys have had a stylised logo designed to appear similar to, or pass off as, a Disney-branded product.

'Shoppers should look closely at the product to make sure it is legitimate.'
