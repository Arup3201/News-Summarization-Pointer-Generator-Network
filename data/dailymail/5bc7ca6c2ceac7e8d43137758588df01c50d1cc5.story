A care home worker was jailed today for taking humiliating and degrading photographs of vulnerable elderly residents 'for a laugh'.

Laquiesha Beatty, 22, used her mobile phone to take upsetting images of five women, who were in the advanced stages of dementia.

The images - taken at Oak View care home in Hayling Island, Hampshire - included one of a patient tipped back in a wheelchair in a 'wheelie' position.

Others showed two women in bed together, a patient in a bath with her breasts exposed, and another wearing designer sunglasses.

Portsmouth Crown Court heard the women would not have been able to get themselves into these positions unaided.

All five victims required 24-hour care because of their deteriorating mental and physical health.

Beatty - who secured a job in a strip club after being dismissed from the care home - shouted 'I want my dad', as she was jailed for three months.

Fellow care home worker William Bramwell, 26, was also charged in relation to two of the victims.

Prosecutor Rob Welling said: 'What is clear in this case is that these two defendants utterly abused the trust placed with them by the family members.'

The events were exposed when a photo was sent to someone who called police, the court heard.

All staff were ordered to hand in their mobile phones which prompted an admission from Beatty.

She accepted she had taken offensive photos of human waste before sending them to father-of-four Bramwell, with whom she 'had a laugh'.

In one of the photos, Bramwell is pictured on a bed with one of the patients who looks shocked and upset.

Bramwell was also photographed next to a victim with her underwear pulled down to her thighs. She was crying.

She also photographed another woman on the toilet with another victim in front of her.

Beatty admitted taking a photo of a man's medical records which contained photos of a sore on his bottom.

Mr Welling said: 'The sense of betrayal is palpable.

'The victims are not just those who are residents but those who have had to accept what happened to their loved ones.'

Reaction: Beatty screamed: 'I don't understand!' and 'I want my dad!' as she was jailed for three months for her crimes at Portsmouth Crown Court

He said a relative of one of the victims had treated Beatty with kindness because his mother had been in the care home for so many years.

But the man has had to have counselling to try and overcome the guilt he feels at leaving his mother in Beatty's care.

Hannah Wyatt, defending Beatty, said her client accepted she had been 'stupid'.

'Her actions were those of an incredibly immature and stupid young girl,' she said.

The court heard Beatty had recently got a job in the Elegance strip club in Southsea and was 'terrified' by the thought of prison.

Judge Sarah Munro described the case as 'distressing, to say the least and had no choice but to jail Beatty, from Hayling Island,Â  who admitted five counts of ill treatment/wilful neglect of a person without capacity against five different women.

She also admitted knowingly or recklessly
 obtaining, disclosing, or procuring personal information of a patient 
from another care home.

When her sentence was announced Beatty
 screamed: 'I don't understand!' She stood up and held her hands out, 
shouting 'I want my dad!' before she was taken to the cells.

Bramwell, from Hayling Island, admitted 
two charges of ill treatment/wilful neglect of a person without capacity
 against two different women.

He was handed a three-month jail sentence, suspended for 12 months because of his lower culpability and family responsibilities.

A spokesman for English Oak, which owns Oak View, said: 'The two were quickly dismissed, and English Oak has referred them to the Disclosure and Barring Service to ensure they never work in care again'.
