Barcelona stars Gerard Pique and Alex Song appear to have been scrapping while on top of the team's double-decker bus to celebrate their La Liga triumph.

In these astonishing pictures, former Arsenal midfielder Song and Pique look as if they are brawling  while the bus makes its way around the Catalan city.

Club captain Carlos Puyol and goalkeeper Victor Valdes seem to be playing peacemakers in the end, but looks as if they are having an altercation of their own in the background as their team-mates grapple in front of celebrating supporters.

At one point, Song is seen grabbing the former Manchester United centre's arm and cocking his clenched fist as if readying himself to 
throw a punch.

The photos may be alarming to Pique's girlfriend Colombian singer Shakira who gave birth to their first child Milan in January.

Defence: Pique appears to hold his hands up to stop Song as the bus made its way round the city

A video released of the team's celebrations show the players were all in high spirits, drinking alcohol and play-fighting on the bus - it could be these snaps just caught the pair engaging in boisterous fun.

The parade was to honour Barcelona reclaiming their La Liga crown from Real Madrid, after 
mounting a 10-point lead with three games to play.

Although the scuffle 
went unnoticed on Monday afternoon, politicians in Catalonia have complained that 
drinking on the bus was setting a bad example to young fans who watched 
their title-winners parade the trophy.

Barcelona held their end-of-season awards dinner last night, and Song, who left Arsenal for Spain last summer did not appear in any of the pictures released.

Song, who operates as a holding midfielder, has made 19 appearances since joining last August.

Before
Song's move to La Liga, Pique went public about how he had followed the
Cameroon international's career closely and would welcome him to the 
Nou Camp.

Speaking to El Mundo Deportivo, the defender noted how Song had developed under Arsene Wenger into a ‘very good player’.

‘He is physically very strong and is 
good with the ball at his feet. We are open to his arrival. If he comes,
and from what I have read he could do, we would love to have him.’

But
Song has struggled to force his way into a midfield that boasts 
world-class talents Xavi, Sergio Busquets and Cesc Fabregas and was in 
January voted one of the worst signings of the season behind Real 
Madrid's Luka Modric.
