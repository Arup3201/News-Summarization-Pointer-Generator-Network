She had bought the white Armani suit to accompany her millionaire husband to Royal Ascot.

And Katie Graff was determined to get more than one use out of the ‘beautiful’ £600 outfit.

So she took it to the cleaners. But when it came back with grey patches, she was furious. Mrs Graff, whose husband Raymond is a director of Graff Diamonds, confronted dry cleaner Ian Cohen.

Complained: Katie Graff, 71, bought the outfit (pictured) to wear at Royal Ascot when she went with her husband Raymond in June 2012. But when she took it to the dry cleaners to be cleaned it came back dark grey

She
accused him of leaving her outfit looking like a ‘dishcloth’ with dark 
patches along the lapels and the satin tie of the jacket, a court heard.

Mr Cohen made attempts to clean the suit again but Mrs Graff, 68, said the results left it ‘slate grey’.She
demanded the full cost of the suit. Mr Cohen eventually offered her 
£400, even though he claimed that experts who examined the garment said 
the ‘slight dark grime’ had not been caused by cleaning but possibly by 
humidity while being stored.

Mrs Graff sued and this week a judge found Mr Cohen liable. He awarded Mrs Graff £600 compensation and £140 costs.

Mrs
Graff, whose husband runs the production side of the business founded 
by his brother Laurence, bought the Emporio Armani design to wear at 
Royal Ascot in June 2012.

Afterwards she took it to Look New  Dry 
Cleaners. She has used the business, near her home which backs on to 
Hampstead Heath in North West London, for several years.

‘When I 
picked it up it was on a wire-frame hanger, which I hate, and an opaque 
plastic cover,’ she told Central London county court.

Owner: Ian Cohen holds Mrs Graff's Armani suit inside Look New Dry Cleaners. He must pay her £600

‘I opened it up
and to my horror it had gone from white to slate grey. Everybody makes 
mistakes, but I was angry about the indignity of how they treated me. I 
was so concerned and incensed that they had not said to me, “We’re 
really sorry, there’s been an accident on the suit”.

‘It looked like
a dishcloth in my kitchen, all the life had gone out of it. I knew I 
was absolutely right and they were not going to get away with it.’

Mr Cohen has been running his business for 40 years.

His celebrity clients have included Tom Hanks, Pierce Brosnan, Johnny Depp and Jennifer Aniston.

Determined: Mrs Graff pictured outside court. She turned down the offer of £400 compensation from the dry cleaner and took her case to court to be offered the full £600

He
admitted he had made a mistake by accepting the suit without first 
checking that its cleaning instruction label was not missing. Forensic 
examination proved the cleaning chemicals he used were not to blame for 
altering the acetate and rayon material, he said.

But at the end of a
16-month legal battle, the judge found the dry cleaner liable and 
awarded Mrs Graff full compensation and her costs, saying that Mr Cohen 
‘has to accept that he can’t really tell whether someone on site did 
something wrong causing the damage to the suit’.

Mr Cohen, who has 
paid Mrs Graff by cheque, said yesterday: ‘When it happened she came in 
here and started screaming at me. I told her that if you’re going to 
scream and shout then you won’t achieve anything.

‘In my 40 years of 
business, I’ve never had an issue like this. I still don’t think the 
suit is like a dishcloth or slate grey. I think I’m now going to give it
to charity.’
