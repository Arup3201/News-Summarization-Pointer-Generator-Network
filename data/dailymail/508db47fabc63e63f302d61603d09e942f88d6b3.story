Hundreds have paid £2 a time to use a private toll road built by a businessman who was fed up of waiting for the council to re-open a bypass.

Mike Watts was among thousands of motorists faced with a 14-mile detour after a section of the A431 in Kelston, Somerset was cordoned off following a landslip.

He spent £150,000 building the 400 yard unofficial road, which opened on Friday, and has already seen around 500 vehicles pass through the toll each day.

More than 1,500 people have already paid £2 a time to use the private toll road in Kelston, Somerset

He told MailOnline: ‘I have been involved in various businesses in my time but never have I had such a positive response.

‘People that are using it are happy to pay the toll – in fact, one man today drove down the road, paid his £2 then turned round and drove back through and said here’s a present for you. It was a bag of cakes for the toll operators.’

The new route, which has not yet received planning permission, allows motorist to avoid an hour-long diversion through country lanes.

‘It is such a relief for so many people and too many people were displaced by the road closure,’ he said.

‘Building a toll road is a big risk but we are confident that we can make the money back.’

The A431 near Bath which is closed as a private toll road has opened that avoids the closed section

That'll
 be £2 please, sir: A driver pays up to avoid a 10-mile detour on the A4
 although the local council do not approve of the road which cuts 
through an unused field

Mike Watts's toll road will be open 24 hours a day, seven days a week, with toll operators there all the time

Mr Watts believes he will need to make £300,000 by the end of the year to cover the build of the road and its upkeep.

‘It
 means we need about 1,000 cars a day but given the amount of interest 
we’ve had and we haven’t even put the signs up yet, we are really 
hopeful we can make that target, especially by the time the schools go 
back.’

The land is being 
rented from farmer John Dinham until Christmas and he has now applied 
for retrospective permission for the 22ft-wide road.

The
 father-of-four said he is working very closely with Bath and North East
 Somerset Council and the Highways Agency on the project.

‘The
 leader of the council was here today with the group manager of the 
Highways Agency and we had a wonderful meeting. They have gone away to 
design the signs for the road to let people know the toll is open.

Mr Watts says he has been overwhelmed by the positive response and has already had 1,500 use it

The Kelston toll road has been opened by local businessman Mike Watts, 62, who was fed up of an hour long detour caused by roadworks after just a few hundred yards of highway was cordoned off thanks to a landslip

‘The relationship could not be better, they are very supportive and being really helpful.

‘They
 watched as we built the road and they had their concerns but they saw 
how professional it was and we were mindful of their repair works so we 
are working together with them.’

The
 62-year-old has taken out public liability insurance and the Health and
 Safety Executive has inspected the site to make sure it is on stable 
ground.

However, if an accident was to occur on the stretch of road motorists will be liable.

He
 said: ‘Your own car insurance would cover it in the same way that if 
you had an accident in a private car park, such as a supermarket car 
park, they have a disclaimer that you use this car park at your own 
risk.

‘We have the disclaimer for those using our road.’

Businessman Mike Watts decided to open the thoroughfare - made of a mix of asphalt and chippings

The A431 between Bristol and Bath was closed in February after a landslip caused cracks to appear in the road.

Businesses
 in the area soon began to suffer – including the cafe and party 
supplies shop Mr Watts runs with his 52-year-old wife Wendy in Bath.

‘It
 used to just be a very quick drive for us to Bath, but we were having 
to do a 14-mile detour which was taking up to an hour down tiny lanes 
just not designed to take the traffic,’ Mr Watts explained.

Local
 mother of two Laura Fenton, 28, said she was delighted with the road, 
adding: ‘It was difficult getting kids around. If I wanted to take them 
to a doctor’s appointment in Bath it was a huge diversion. I think what 
Mike and the farmer have done is brilliant. It has already helped a lot 
of people and I can see us using it a lot.’

But
 a council spokesman said: ‘While we appreciate the difficulties 
residents have experienced, it’s not just the planning, it’s the safety 
and legal aspect of drivers using the road.’ He added: ‘Work has started
 to deliver a solution as quickly as possible.’
