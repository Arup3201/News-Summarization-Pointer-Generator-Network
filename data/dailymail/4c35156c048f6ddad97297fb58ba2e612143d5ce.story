Flying into an airport is most people’s first glimpse of their holiday or business destination.

After being inspired by these views as she travelled the world, art director Lauren O’Neill has collected satellite shots of global airports from London's Heathrow to New York's John F. Kennedy airport.

The images reveal the complex beauty of these sprawling behemoths, and in the same way flights keep cities connected, the airports resemble connections in the human body - from muscles to nerves.

Brooklyn-based art director Lauren O'Neill collected satellite shots of global airports after she was inspired by the 'systems of design at play' spotted as she travelled the world. The images reveal the complex beauty of these sprawling behemoths and as flights keep cities connected, the airports resemble connections in the human body. For example, this aerial shot of Zurich airport looks like muscles stretched over a skeleton

O’Neill wrote on her blog: ‘I’ve been fascinated by airports for as long as I can remember - there’s something about the comings and goings, the organisation and operation that’s so intriguing to me.

‘I’ve always lived in a direct flight pattern of an airport. Day-to-day, I glance out my window and watch planes circle about waiting to land.’

Among her collection is an aerial shot of Zurich airport. Its runways and buildings, interspersed with green patches, look like muscles stretched over a skeleton.

The airport is divided in three, with Terminal A, B, and E connected to central building via an automated track, known as the Skymetro.

Terminal A is used by domestic flights in the Schengen Area, Terminal E is entirely used by international flights. While Terminal B is designed to handle both Schengen and some non-Schengen flights, keeping the two sets of passenger flows separate.

Elsewhere, the clinical look of Hartsfield Jackson Atlanta International Airport and planes, captured from above, resembles strips of veins and nerves. It is located seven miles (11 km) south of the central business district of Atlanta, Georgia and has been one of the world's busiest airports since 1998. Many of the one million flights that take off and land are domestic flights

The markings painted onto the runways of Wellington International Airport (pictured) resemble the lines drawn on cosmetic surgery patient's skin. Dotted white lines are cut through with solid yellow markings that show where planes park, turn around and take off from. Its close proximity to one of its car parks is visible in the top right-hand corner

Elsewhere, the clinical look of Hartsfield Jackson Atlanta International Airport, and planes, captured from above resembles strips of veins and nerves.

It is located seven miles (11 km) south of the central business district of Atlanta, Georgia and has been one of the world's busiest airports since 1998.

Many of the one million flights that take off and land are domestic flights, and Atlanta serves as a major hub for travel throughout the Southeastern U.S.

It has 207 domestic and international gates served over seven terminals.

The markings painted onto the runways of Wellington International Airport resemble the lines drawn on cosmetic surgery patients' skin. Dotted white lines are cut through with solid yellow markings that show where planes park, turn around and take off. Its close proximity to one of its car parks is visible in the top right-hand corner.

Although many airports in the collection feature parallel and straight lines, Newark Liberty International Airport stands out because of its curved design. It straddles the municipal boundary between Newark and Elizabeth in New Jersey. As a result, the airport is owned by the city of Newark but operated by the Port Authority of New York and New Jersey

The Adolfo Suárez Madrid-Barajas Airport features a mixture of curves and straight lines and looks like a graphic created using a Spirograph. It is the main hub and maintenance base for the Iberia airline, which is responsible for more than 60 percent of Barajas' traffic. Following the death of former Spanish Prime Minister, Adolfo Suárez in March, Madrid-Barajas was renamed Aeropuerto Adolfo Suárez, Madrid-Barajas

Wellington has a reputation for rough and turbulent landings due to the channelling effect of Cook Strait creating strong and gusty winds.

‘During layovers, I often find myself observing the activity on the runway and thinking that I’d love to see this from above,’ continued O’Neill.

‘With a creative block on a project, I took to Google mapping airports and was enamoured by the beautiful satellite shots on my screen. Since then, wanderlust has often inspired me to get lost in the satellite imagery of various destinations even when I’m glued to my desk.’

Although many airports in the collection feature parallel and straight lines, Newark Liberty International Airport stands out because of its curved design.

The sparse nature of Austin-Bergstrom International Airport is revealed in one image, where the shape of the runway and the airport resembles an elephant and its trunk. It covers only 6.6 square miles (17 sq km) and has just two runways and three helipads

John F. Kennedy International Airport (pictured) was originally called Idlewild Airport after the golf course it was built on. It was designed to relieve LaGuardia Airport in Queens, which was crowded soon after opening in 1939. Over seventy airlines operate out of JFK and it is the base for JetBlue Airways

It straddles the municipal boundary between Newark and Elizabeth in New Jersey. As a result, the airport is owned by the city of Newark, but operated by the Port Authority of New York and New Jersey.

The Adolfo Suárez Madrid–Barajas Airport features a mixture of curves and straight lines, and consequently looks like a graphic created using a Spirograph.

It is the main hub and maintenance base for the Iberia airline, which is responsible for more than 60 percent of Barajas' traffic.

Following the death of former Spanish Prime Minister, Adolfo Suárez in March, Madrid-Barajas was renamed Aeropuerto Adolfo Suárez, Madrid–Barajas.

The sparse nature and stark contrast of Austin-Bergstrom International Airport is revealed in one image, where the shape of the runway and the airport resembles an elephant and its trunk. It covers only 6.6 square miles (17 sq km) and has just two runways and three helipads.

Aerial shots of Logan International Airport (pictured) make it look more like an intersection on a road, than an airport. Its parallel runways resemble arm and leg bones, and the airport is situated next to the port in Boston, Massachusetts

While many of the airports are a wash of oranges, blacks and greens, London Heathrow (pictured) looks almost clinical with its solid white and grey hues. The planes appear to camouflage into the runways, and even the terminal buildings are a discreet silver colour. The uniform positioning of the planes resemble teeth. Heathrow is the fifth busiest airport in the world, in terms of passenger traffic, handling more international passengers than any other airport around the globe

The airport is named after Captain John August Earl Bergstrom, an officer who served for the 19th Bombardment Group of the U.S. Air Force.

And the uniform positioning of the planes in O’Neill’s image resembles teeth.

The shape of the terminals at Denver airport look like planes themselves, with long stretching buildings, resembling the wings, and centre foyers that look like the cockpit. At 54 square miles (139 sq km), it is the largest airport in the U.S by total area, and runway 16R/34L is the longest public use runway in the country

Heathrow is the busiest airport in the UK, and the fifth busiest airport in the world, in terms of passenger traffic, handling more international passengers than any other airport around the globe.

It began in 1929 as a small airfield called Great West Aerodrome on land near the hamlet of Heathrow, from which the airport takes its name.

Meanwhile, the shape of the terminals at Denver airport look like planes themselves, with long stretching buildings, resembling the wings, and centre foyers resembling cockpits.

At 54 square miles (139 sq km), it is the largest airport in the U.S by total area, and its runway 16R/34L is the longest public use runway in the country.

O’Neill continued: ‘I love the idea of circling above an airport waiting to land. I feel like that mirrors my process of searching for and cropping the right shot.

'Plus, I love the fact that a lot of the taxiway markings and linework are patterned across an airport’s tarmac.’

O’Neill is senior associate art director at Martha Stewart Weddings magazine, she has also freelanced as a graphic designer and taught graphic design to sophomores and juniors at Virginia Commonwealth University arts.

O. R. Tambo International Airport in Johannesburg (pictured) is one of the darkest images in O'Neill's collection. It is also the only one to show clouds above the runways. The airport is one of the few in the world that has non-stop flights to six inhabited continents, others include Dubai International Airport, Abu Dhabi International Airport and Doha International Airport
