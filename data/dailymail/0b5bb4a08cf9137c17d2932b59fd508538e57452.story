Authorities have charged a 19-year-old man with murder for Friday's shooting outside a dorm at South Carolina State University.

Justin Bernard Singleton, of Charleston, was arrested early Saturday morning in the parking lot of an apartment complex near campus. Authorities believe he is the primary suspect in the shooting death of Brandon A. Robinson, 20.

'At this time, we believe we have the individual who fired the shot,' a spokesperson with the South Carolina Law Enforcement Division said.

Snagged: Justin Bernard Singleton, 19, of Charleston, was charged with murder in the shooting death of 20-year-old Brandon Robinson

Police snagged Singleton just after midnight after searching for what they initially thought were four suspects, but notably declined to say if they were still searching for anyone else.

The school's campus was initially locked down Friday to prevent the shooter from returning, it has since been reopened.

Officials do not believe there is any further safety risk to students.

University President Thomas Elzey choked
 back tears Friday as he promised to keep his students safe. He said the 
student killed was a nice young man.

'We, again, are extraordinarily sad about this,' Elzey added. 'He was a very nice young man. And it hurts. It hurts us all.'

Campus Police Chief Mernard Clarkson says police don't know what led to the shooting.

The gunmen left campus before police could catch them, but authorities decided to lock down the campus so they could not return.

'Our students are secure and safe as we keep looking for these individuals,' Clarkson said.

The wounded student was transported to Regional Medical Center, where he later died.

Clarkson did not say what led to the shooting and did not update the wounded student's condition.

He also did not release any details about the suspects.

Claflin University Police also issued their own alert to students Friday regarding the shooting since the school's campus is directly across the street from South Carolina State, WLTX reported.

The Claflin alert was the first to finger Justin Bernard Singleton of 
Charleston as a suspect, before local police or SC State took such action.

Sirens sounded across campus after an alert was issued and police secured gates leading into the university.
