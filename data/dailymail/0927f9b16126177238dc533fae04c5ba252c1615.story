Child abuser Sir Cyril Smith admitted spanking young boys when interviewed by detectives in the 1960s, it was claimed today.

A former detective who investigated the former MP said he believes he would have confessed to his guilt if he had been put on trial.

The claims emerged as the MP's autobiography reveals he was friends with the late DJ Jimmy Saville - also accused of being a serial paedophile.

Friends: Sir Cyril Smith revealed in his autiobiography how he had met Jimmy Savile at a medieval banquet when he joined in communal singing in 1977. He impressed the late DJ so much he was invited to appear on his BBC show Clunk Clink

According to the Sun, Smith wrote in his 1977 autobiography Big Cyril: 'I once attended a medieval banquet at Worsely, Lancashire, along with Jimmy Savile. When I joined the community singing, Jimmy blurted out, 'You've got a nice voice there Cyril, you must come on my programme!'

'That's how I ended up singing 'She's a Lassie from Lancashire' on Clunk Clink.

He continued: 'Jimmy Savile openly admits that his work as a disc jockey is a joke, but his record of public service and charity must be unequalled.'

It was revealed yesterday how prosecutors missed three chances to convict Smith for indecent assault, despite the fact detectives 40 years ago were convinced he was guilty.

His original file was passed back to the police by the Director of Public Prosecutions (DPP) in 1970, arguing the allegations were too old, not corroborated and made by boys with dubious characters.

Today, a retired officer told how he was drafted in to investigate Smith a year earlier, when the Rochdale force was absorbed into Lancashire Constabulary.

He said that another detective who previously worked on the case, Rochdale-based Derek Wheater, had warned him his attempts to expose Smith had been ‘blocked’ at every turn by influential friends of the politician.

Instead, Mr Wheater wanted a new officer - one not already known in the town - to take over and have another attempt.

The ex-detective, who asked not to be named, said: 'He said they had made numerous attempts to investigate Cyril Smith but was getting obstructed by dignitaries. He said you are unknown officers and may fare better.'

Over the following months, he compiled a dossier on the politician which he believed proved his guilt.

He said: 'He didn’t deny certain things. He admitted he spanked them - his last words were ‘this will kill my mother’.

'We had enough, I think. To be quite honest I think if it had gone to trial he would have had admitted it. It suggested he was scared.'

Missed opportunities: Both Greater Manchester Police (GMP) and the Crown Prosecution Service (CPS) said if Smith, right, had been accused today he would be charged and prosecuted

In a striking similarity to Jimmy Savile, bachelor Smith lived with his mother Eva until her death in 1994. When he became mayor of Rochdale in the 1960s, she was his lady mayoress.

The retired detective, who was based at Whitefield, said that, just as he was completing the investigation, he was forced to hand over the file to senior officers from force HQ - and never saw or heard of it again. Shortly afterwards the DPP marked it ‘no further action’.

Meanwhile, a former special branch officer claimed the file eventually landed in his office because it was so politically sensitive.

Tony Robinson, based at Preston at the time, said: 'You can imagine them saying: ‘What are we going to do with this? It’s a bit of a political hot potato, send it to special branch, get it buried’.'

He said he eventually received a call in around 1977 - when Smith’s Liberal party was hoping to form a pact with the Labour government - from MI5 ordering him to send it to London via a personal courier.

He added: 'It’s plain to see why MI5 wanted the file. Cyril Smith was being investigated for a position at the top table.'

Yesterday, alleged victim Chris Marshall said he was just seven or eight when he was sexually abused by Smith at a notorious school for vulnerable boys.

Mr Marshall, now 40, moved into Knowl View in Rochdale in 1979. Just months later, he says, he was forced to perform a sex act on Smith – known to the pupils as ‘the fat man’ – after being ‘summoned’ from his dormitory in the dead of night.

He said: ‘A member of staff came up and took me from the room. He took me into this flat. The fat man was on the bed and another kid was there too.

‘We were told to go back afterwards to our rooms, not to wake anybody else up and have a good breakfast in the morning.

‘It was a dreadful, dreadful experience but I was so confused I didn’t tell anyone until much later. But the school was rife with this type of behaviour and there were all sorts of sexual things going on.’

After the abuse, he begged staff for his own room. When he got his wish, he slept with a chair against the door so no-one could get in.

Mr Marshall said that it was only when he was in his teens and saw photos of the high-profile politician in a newspaper that he realised who his abuser was.

He said: ‘It was definitely Cyril Smith. The truth is he was a child abuser and targeted vulnerable children. People need to know this is what he was – he was a paedophile.’

Smith died in 2010, having retired as an MP in 1992.

Two alleged victims of Sir Cyril Smith are considering legal action against Rochdale council for abuse suffered in a boys’ hostel.

The
men - both now in their 60s - have approached Manchester legal firm Pannone in the hope of winning compensation. They say they were molested
as teenagers by Smith while living at Cambridge House hostel.

The council says it is looking into its involvement in the hostel, which was set up by Smith in 1962.

It was largely set up using cash from the local 
Rotary Club, but was also given a council grant on its foundation, according to the Manchester Evening News.

However, in 1965 the council refused to give a larger grant - thought to be around £700 - and the hostel shut.

One
of the alleged victims, now 67, made allegations of abuse to police at 
the time. The second had not previously come forward, taking the tally 
of people who claim they were abused by Smith to 13.

A spokesman for Pannone said it is investigating the extent of the council’s involvement.

Linda
Fisher, director of corporate services at the council, said: 'The 
sexual abuse of children is an awful crime carried about by the worst 
kind of criminals.

'Cambridge
House was a privately-run care home and we have contacted the solicitor
quoted in the media to clarify the details behind the claims being made
against the council.

'We encourage anyone with allegations to contact Greater Manchester Police so they can be looked into immediately.'
