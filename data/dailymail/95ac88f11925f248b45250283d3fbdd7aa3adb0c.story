Oh dear - this intruder was caught out when they wandered into a back garden with a tennis court.

The small roe deer got his antlers snagged in the net and was found frantically trying to get free by the startled householder.

They called the RSPCA and two inspectors were sent to cut free the stricken beast - nicknamed Murray after Scottish tennis star Andy - in Broadbridge Heath near Horsham, West Sussex.

McEn-roe: This roe deer got served with a tricky situation after it became trapped in a tennis court net

RSPCA inspector Liz Wheeler said: 'This poor boy had a very frightening experience.

'His antlers were completely entwined in the netting and he was getting frantic trying to free himself.

'There is no way he would have been able to untangle himself without any help.

'Had the owners of the property not been at home to find him and thought to call us, it is likely that the deer may have suffered an injury or starved to death.

'Luckily, Murray escaped with only a minor injury to his leg and was released back into the wild.'

Frustration: But the unlucky animal was rescued by two RSPCA inspectors after the homeowner spotted the stricken beast

RSPCA Inspector Wheeler said incidents like this, which can be fatal, can be avoided if nets are put away safely after use

Every year, dozens of deer and other animals are injured and killed after getting caught in man-made netting, with fruit netting being especially deadly to hedgehogs.

Inspector Wheeler added: 'The problem is so easily avoidable by ensuring nets are removed and stored, or taken home after a game of tennis and any discarded netting is safely placed in a bin.

'I would ask anyone with a net in their garden to please consider the consequences for animals and birds and make frequent checks so that any trapped wildlife may be freed.'
