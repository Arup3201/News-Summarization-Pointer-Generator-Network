A rusting wreck found 180ft underwater in a Papua New Guinea harbour is thought to be that of a Second World War Japanese submarine, experts revealed today.

The 66ft-long 'man-made object' found by experts near Simpson Harbour in Rabaul, Papua New Guinea is thought to be a submarine from a major Japanese military base on the northeast coast of the South Pacific country.

The wreck was partially buried in sand when discovered, but Australian navy historians were able to conclude that it was Japanese after studying underwater images.

Simpson Harbour in Rabaul was Japan's major base in the Southwest Pacific for most of World War Two, and it is thought both the Japanese and the U.S. had accounted for all subs in that area.

Most of the wrecks in the harbour came from the country, and previous known submarine wrecks were Japanese, according to Gary Oakley, a Australian War Memorial curator and a former submariner.

He said: 'My best guess would be it's a Japanese midget submarine. It doesn't look big enough to be an ocean-going ... submarine.'

One and two-man Japanese midget submarines were transported by ship or larger submarines and used covertly to infiltrate enemy targets including Pearl Harbor in Hawaii and Sydney Harbor.

Such a submarine could have been destroyed by an American air raid or naval bombardment or even scuttled by the Japanese toward the end of the war.

New Zealand Navy Lt. Commander Matthew Ray said underwater remote-controlled vehicles with cameras will be used to try to identify the wreck.

Oakley said it could be the first Australian submarine lost in World War I, although that submarine, AE1, was thought to have sunk in another harbor 12 miles (20 kilometers) away.

AE1 became the first Australian naval loss of the war when it sank on Sept. 15, 1914, with the loss of 35 lives. Rabaul was then the capital of the German New Guineau colony, which was quickly lost to the British.
