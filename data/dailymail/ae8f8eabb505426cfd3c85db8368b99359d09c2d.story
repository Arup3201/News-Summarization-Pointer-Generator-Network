The Penn State cheerleader who was badly injured after falling five stories from an apartment window is showing steady signs of improvement, but remains critical, a family spokesman said.

Sophomore Paige Raque, 19, fell 39 feet from an off-campus housing complex on Saturday and suffered severe brain and pelvic injuries after landing on the pavement below.

Yesterday, she opened her eyes for the first time since the horrific fall.

Randy Jepson, the Penn State men's gymnastics coach and family spokesman, told the Centre Daily Times: '[Yesterday] was a pretty active day.'

'She did have some movement, and doctors worked quite a bit with her. Sheâ€™s resting well.'

Jepson added: 'With brain injuries, 
the doctors said there are signs of improvements and periods of rest. We
need to be optimistic, because this really is a day-by-day thing.'

Her older brother Parker Raque, 21, 
who also attends Penn State and is the captain of the gymnastics team, 
has been posting updates about Paige on his Twitter account.

Last night, he tweeted: 'Paige did a 
lot of resting today but we did see her open her beautiful eyes a bit. 
hoping for more progress in next few days!'

A probe into what caused Miss Raque to fall at the Calder Commons apartment complex is ongoing, though it appears to have been accidental, the Times reported on Tuesday.

Police have declined to say whether alcohol was involved.

Authorities have said the cheerleader fell 39 feet through a screened window during a party Saturday night on the fifth floor of the downtown apartment building.

A university directory listed Ms Raque's address on the same floor.

She was flown to Altoona Regional Health System with head and pelvic injuries.

Ms Raque and her family were flooded 
with messages of support on social media, including Penn State's 
football coach Bill O'Brien.

'My heart goes out to Paige and her 
family, and I feel terrible about that,' Mr O'Brien said at his weekly 
press conference. 'I know her brother is a great gymnast here, and it's a
terrible thing.'

Mr Jepson said the family appreciated the kind thoughts from across the Penn State campus. 'The biggest thing the family is requesting is prayer and support,' he said.

Ms Raque graduated from the Christian Academy of Louisville in 2011.

Records show that she was a talented athlete in high school, running in short-distance track and field sprints and relays. She also did the long jump event.
