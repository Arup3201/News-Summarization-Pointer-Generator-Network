They are words which will strike fear into every addict - we're running out of chocolate.

That's according to the world's largest confectionary producer, which has joined Mars in warning of a massive shortfall which could reach a million tonnes a year by 2020.

Switzerland's Barry Callebaut Group said soaring demand have helped chocolate prices hit more than double what they were just eight years ago.

Help! We're running out of chocolate - at least according to the world's biggest confectionary producer

The supplier, which provides chocolate for firms from global giants to artisan bakers, has revealed it sold 1.7million tonnes in 2013/14 - a rise of 11.7 per cent on the year before.

But there are limited quantities of the fragile crop - which means as production rises, so does the price.

That leaves manufacturers with little choice but to raise prices on the shelves, make bars smaller or pack them with fruit, nuts and wafers.

Industry experts say the world is in its longest production shortfall for five decades.

Cocoa prices rose by a quarter in a year to a peak in August of £2,000 a tonne, nearing a February 2011 peak, Barry Callebaut said.

Before the end of 2007 they had barely risen above £1,300. In 2005 they hovered around just £1,000, according to figures from the London-based International Cocoa Organization (ICCO).

Barry Callebaut chief executive Juergen Steinemann said the hike was fuelled partly by a 'potential cocoa shortage' by 2020 - echoing previous warnings by Mars Chocolate. 

The British-founded sweet treats giant has repeatedly claimed demand will outstrip supply by a million tonnes a year by 2020.

'The global cocoa sector may suffer a 1million metric ton shortfall by 2020 because of increasing economic and environmental pressures on cocoa farms around the world,' the firm said.

'Our long-term business depends on a sustainable supply of high quality cocoa, and we believe that securing cocoa’s future begins with increasing yield for the smallholder farmers.'

Partly to blame are disease and drought, according to Bloomberg News - which could be beaten by resilient new breeds of cocoa beans.

But we are also getting hungrier for sweet treats - especially  in developing nations like China.

Barry Callebaut's sales grew by 9.3 per cent in Asia last year - compared to 5.4 per cent in the Americas and just 0.1 per cent in western Europe.

Mars opened a £170million new plant in Kansas earlier this year to meet rising demand, and last month Barry Callebaut announced it would pour £7.3million into its factory in Sao Paulo, Brazil.

But some surprising news events have a hand in the price, including the Ebola outbreak. 

Because 70 per cent of the world's cocoa comes from West Africa, chaos and quarantine restrictions mean global production has dipped by 0.7 per cent, the ICCO said.

And pledges to beat Third World poverty could also have an impact - as many African cocoa farmers live on less than £1 a day.
