The woman who posed for an incredibly realistic image painted on the back of a ute that shows herself being kidnapped has hit back at critics who say the artwork is in bad taste.

The image shows Bree Benyon, from Townsville, lying down with her hands bound and mouth gagged and with a shovel lying on top of her. Incredibly, the image was painted by the model's sign-writer father and adorns her stepmother's ute.

The image looks so real that some motorists thought there really was a woman being held hostage in the back of the vehicle.

Model Bree Benyon has caused a storm of controversy over this lifelike image of her bound and gagged painted on the back of her stepmother's ute

Townsville's Bree Benyon told people against the image yesterday to 'live a little' and 'have a sense of humour' on Facebook

After receiving criticism on Facebook, she was forced to break her silence and told people to 'lighten up' about the image, which she insists is little more than a family joke.

'Live a little, have a sense of humour – obviously the picture got people's attention so the photo worked,' Benyon wrote on Facebook.

Benyon's father is a professional sign-writer and painted it on the back of her stepmother’s ute, presumably in an effort to advertise his business.

The image sparked controversy after it was published in the Townsville Bulletin yesterday.

Some people thought the image was in poor taste, but others told people offended by it to 'get over it'.

The model had just returned from a trip to the Gold Coast after she was selected to appear in Maxim magazine's 2015 bikini calendar.

Ms Benyon was contacted for further comment.
