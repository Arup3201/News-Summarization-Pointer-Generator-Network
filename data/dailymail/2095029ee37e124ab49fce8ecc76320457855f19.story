A jobless man set himself on fire in Tunisia today in a gesture recalling the self-immolation of Mohamed Bouazizi, whose death ignited a revolt that shook the Arab world.

Security forces and bystanders in Tunis tried to extinguish the flames before the man was rushed to hospital, witnesses said.

'He is in very critical condition,' a medical source in Mourouj hospital said, but gave no further details.

The body of a young Tunisian man, who set himself on fire, is seen at the main street of the capital Tunis

The man doused himself with gasoline and self fire to himself, reviving memories of the self-immolation that helped spark the Arab Spring uprisings

The incident occurred hours before Prime Minister-designate Ali Larayedh was due to seek a confidence vote for his new Islamist-led government from the National Constituent Assembly.

The man burned himself outside the municipal theatre in the capital's main Habib Bourguiba Avenue, the focus for protests that toppled President Zine al-Abidine Ben Ali two years ago.

An Interior Ministry official did not name the victim, but said he was aged 27, hailed from the north-western city of Jandouba and had been looking for a job for a long time.

Tunisia's unemployment rate stands at about 17 per cent, with graduates forming a large proportion of the jobless total.

Several Tunisians have set themselves ablaze in the past two years in protests emulating that of Bouazizi, a street vendor who torched himself on December 17, 2010, in the town of Sidi Bouzid after a policewoman confiscated his fruit cart.

Bouazizi's death sparked protests that ended with Ben Ali's overthrow and inspired rebellions elsewhere in the Middle East.

The man is believed to be from a poor town in northwestern Tunisia. He is in a critical condition

The economic and social problems that fuelled Tunisia's uprising have yet to be solved in a country now deeply polarised between Islamists and their opponents and still awaiting a new constitution to advance a transition from autocracy.

The last government, led by Hamadi Jebali, collapsed after the premier's own moderate Islamist Ennahda party rejected his plan for a technocrat cabinet to lead Tunisia to elections.

Jebali had proposed this as a way to calm unrest over the assassination on February 6 of secular opposition leader Chokri Belaid by what the authorities say was a group of Salafi Islamist militants, four of whom have been arrested.

Larayedh, who was Interior Minister under Jebali, has named independents to take several key portfolios, but failed to bring additional secular parties into the Ennahda-led coalition.

The political crisis has delayed talks with the International Monetary Fund on a $1.78billion loan.
