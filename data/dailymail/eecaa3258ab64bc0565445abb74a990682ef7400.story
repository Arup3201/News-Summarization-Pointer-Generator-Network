Anyone caught rigging energy bills will face the 'full force of the law' the government warned today after a whistleblower claimed power firms regularly fixed  Britain's £300 billion wholesale gas market.

Energy Secretary Ed Davey told the Commons that any attempt to manipulate markets was wrong, but the impact would be even more severe at a time when families are struggling to pay soaring heating bills.

City watchdog the Financial Services Authority (FSA) and Energy regulator Ofgem have launched investigations into the claims, as industry insiders complained of a 'very laxly-regulated environment'.

'Bent' market: Former trader turned whistleblower Seth Freedman claimed that manipulation is 'rife'

Mr Davey told MPs in a Commons statement: 'Market abuse is always wrong, but at a time when people and companies are struggling with high energy bills, the country would expect us to take firm action if these allegations prove true, and we will.

'These allegations of market manipulation are being taken very seriously. We will support the regulators taking whatever steps necessary to ensure that the full force of the law is applied, if they are true, so that any guilty parties are held to account.'

Downing Street called for a speedy inquiry. A spokesman for David Cameron said: 'If there has been manipulation of the energy market, then action needs to be taken very quickly.

'People in this country deserve markets that are fair and if there has been wrongdoing, that is totally unacceptable and the regulator should come down on those people very hard.'

The manipulation of wholesale prices - linked to the bills charged to households - is alleged by a 
whistleblower who spotted unusual gas market trading patterns and price changes 
in September.

Seth Freedman, a former City trader who worked as a price
reporter at the energy analyst firm ICIS Heren for nine months, claimed the market is 'bent' and said tighter regulation is urgently required.

He said: 'As I was getting closer and closer to traders and participators in the market it became apparent that people thought manipulation was rife. Then various examples were brought to light.

'The big six are trading in the gas market, but so are banks, hedge funds and all kinds of participants,' he told Sky News. 'Commodities are traded in a very laxly-regulated environment.'

Mr Freedman added that many European politicians are calling for tougher regulation to make the markets more transparent and avoid 'cloak and dagger' dealings behind the scenes.

He told Sky News: 'The idea that people don't know what's going on at wholesale level will certainly raise suspicion and the response from MPs so far is that this needs to be urgently addressed.'

Mr Freedman claims to have identified a series 
of suspect trades on September 28 this year which were indicative of a 
widespread problem, reported the Guardian.

The date is important as it marks the end of the gas
financial year and can have an important influence on future prices.

The alleged manipulation is claimed to 
have cut the wholesale price of gas, which therefore does not imply it 
had an impact on consumer prices.

The process has similarities to the 
way banks rigged the interest rates at which they borrowed from each 
other during the Libor scandal.

The benchmark prices are critically 
important because they form the basis for many wholesale gas contracts, 
while small changes in the price can cost or save companies millions of 
pounds.

Britain’s energy supplies are 
dominated by a ‘big six’ group of British Gas (which is part of 
Centrica), Scottish and Southern Energy, Eon, Npower, EDF and Scottish 
Power.

All but one of these companies has 
raised prices in the last few weeks, blaming a combination of the rising
cost of wholesale gas and the high cost of switching to green energy.

Punishments possible: Energy Secretary Ed Davey warned anyone found guilty would be held to account

Any proof that power companies have 
rigged wholesale prices would be devastating in terms of public trust, 
while it could also lead to fines running to tens of millions of pounds.

Mr Clegg told Sky News: ‘So many people are struggling to pay their bills - and gas bills during the winter are one of the biggest expenses that many families are having to deal with at the moment.

'If there is evidence that those household prices are higher because of cynical manipulation in the wholesale market, I think people will be enraged'

'If there is evidence that those household prices are higher because of cynical manipulation in the wholesale market, I think people will be enraged. That's why we need to take it very seriously.’

The nation is currently suffering the 
longest cost of living squeeze in at least a century with the result 
many poorer households face a nightmare choice between heating and 
eating.

At the same time, thousands of 
elderly people will die this winter from illnesses exacerbated by the 
fact they are living in cold homes.

The companies deny the claims and insist they have procedures in place to prevent any form of price fixing by their traders.

The central allegation is that gas 
prices were rigged to appear either higher or lower in order to suit the
financial interests of traders who buy and sell huge quantities of gas 
on a daily basis.

Mr Davey, said he was first alerted to the allegations last Friday and offered to change the law if the powers of regulators including the FSA, Ofgem and the Office of Fair Trading are found to be lacking.

'I am extremely concerned about these allegations and will be keeping in close touch with the regulators while they get to the bottom of this'

‘I am extremely concerned about these 
allegations and will be keeping in close touch with the regulators while
they get to the bottom of this,’ he said.

A department spokesman said: ‘At a 
time of economic uncertainty and rising global energy prices, British 
consumers deserve markets that are fair.

‘The Government takes alleged abuse in our markets very seriously.’

Speaking on ITV’s Daybreak, shadow energy secretary Caroline Flint called for greater transparency in the energy sector.

She said: ‘Whether these allegations prove right or not there is a huge lack of confidence in this country in the energy sector - people just don’t trust it any more.

‘Our energy bills have gone up by over 
£200 in recent years and in the last few weeks prices have gone up again
so these latest allegations couldn’t have come at a worse time for 
people trying to heat their homes.’

Officials stressed the investigations 
by Ofgem and the FSA should not be pre-empted, however they insisted it 
is important to ensure ‘any wrongdoers are held to account’.

Mr Freedman is understood to have 
taped conversations with traders about the unusual price changes on 
September 28. These have been handed over to the FSA.

One power company trader reportedly 
says: ‘There’s a feeling among some people that somebody’s taking the 
p*** a bit on the day ahead index. Between us I think [Company X] got in
a bit of trouble for that about six months ago.’

ICIS Heren confirmed that it had 
detected some ‘unusual trading’ activity on the British wholesale gas 
market on September 28, which it subsequently reported to Ofgem.

The company said: ‘The cause of the 
trading pattern, which involved a series of deals done below the 
prevailing market trend, has not yet been established.

‘ICIS welcomes the seriousness with 
which the regulator has so far responded to this information and we have
provided all the evidence at our disposal to help the regulator 
determine what happened.’

It is believed that on September 28 prices went down by about 0.4 per cent.

'Our compliance procedures and trading principles are clear. They require us to comply with all EU and UK laws and we have done so'

An FSA spokesman said: ‘We can confirm 
that we have received information in relation to the physical gas market
and will be analysing that material.’

An Ofgem spokesman said: ‘In preparing for full implementation of new EU legislation to tackle market abuse, we will consider carefully any evidence of market abuse that is brought to our attention as well as scope for action under all our other powers.'

The British Gas owner, Centrica, 
denied any wrongdoing. It said: ‘Our compliance procedures and trading 
principles are clear. They require us to comply with all European Union and UK laws and we have done so.’

EDF and SSE denied that they would be 
involved in any attempt to manipulate prices or be involved in other bad
practice. Eon, Npower and Scottish Power have made similar statements 
in the past.

EDF said it does not participate in trading activity that is against existing market regulation.
