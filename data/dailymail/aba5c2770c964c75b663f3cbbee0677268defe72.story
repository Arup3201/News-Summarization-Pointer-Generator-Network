Motorist Michael Kienast told local media: 'I was behind two guys who had a fender bender because the motorists in front took their eyes off the road to glance up at the view.

'The young woman was obviously keen on getting some sun in a place where it doesn't usually shine!

'I heard the guy who was rear-ended shout to the motorist who had hit him: 'Didn't you look where you were supposed to be going?'

'The driver who hit him said: 'Sorry, I was distracted,' and pointed up to the window where the woman was lying. 

The guy who was hit then said: 'Oh, right, I see what you mean'.'
