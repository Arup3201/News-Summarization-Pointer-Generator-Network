Senior Aircraftman Scott Hughes, 20, who was on his way home from a tour in Afghanistan, was killed by a speedboat while on a stop off in Cyprus

A British airman on a Cyprus beach break after fighting in Afghanistan died when he was struck by a speedboat, an inquest heard.

Senior Aircraftman Scott Hughes, 20, was relaxing with comrades before they were due to return home the next day.

SAC Hughes, from Gwynedd, North Wales, had survived a six-month tour of duty battling the Taliban and taking part in ‘demanding and dangerous operations’, including evacuating wounded soldiers.

But as the gunner with 1 Squadron Royal Air Force Regiment swam in the Mediterranean in November 2010, he was hit by the boat.

He suffered severe head injuries and died two days later in a hospital in Limassol.

Flight Sergeant Scott Andrews told the hearing that his comrade said ‘help me, I’m dying’ as he was pulled from the water.

SAC Hughes and his comrades had been flown to Cyprus by the military for two days of 'decompression activities' before returning to civilian life back home.

The military organised water sports on a beach within hours of them landing.

About 120 soldiers and airmen were given a briefing before going kayaking and riding on the rubber ring being towed by the boat.

All the men had to pass a simple swimming test before being allowed to take part wore helmets and brightly coloured buoyancy vests.

But the inquest heard SAC Hughes, of Caernarfon, North Wales, fell off the rubber ring and began swimming back to the pontoon - as many others had that day.

The Cypriot speedboat driver and helper were then seen heading back towards the pontoon where others were waiting for their turn.

Llandudno coroners’ court heard witnesses shouted 'stop' because they could see it heading for Scott.

'Scott was pulled onto the wooden pontoon and said: "Help me, I'm dying"'

Flight Sergeant Andrews

Flight Sergeant Andrews told the inquest: 'My opinion was that they didn’t see him fall in or he would have been collected.'

Coroner Nicola Jones asked: 'Do you think they should have seen him considering what he was wearing?'

Flt Sgt Andrews replied: 'Yes.'

He said the boat travelling at a 'fairly low speed' went over the young gunner.

Flt Sgt Andrews struggled to hold back tears as he told the inquest how SAC Hughes was pulled onto the wooden pontoon and said 'help me, I’m dying.'

He said he was obviously seriously injured after being struck by the power boat operated by the Military Training Wing.

He was treated by colleagues from the Cyprus Sovereign Base who were trained paramedics and had medical equipment nearby.

The gunner underwent three operations in a hospital in Limassol, but died two days later in November 2010.

The inquest heard he had been on 'dangerous operations', including taking part in casualty evacuation tasks.

The inquest is expected to last until Friday.
