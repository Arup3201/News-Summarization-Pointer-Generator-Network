Manchester City emerged 2-0 victors in a rather awkward-feeling fixture against Hamburg in the Hazza Bin Zayed Stadium in Abu Dhabi.

Starting with a relatively strong line up including Frank Lampard, Edin Dzeko and Stevan Jovetic, boss Manuel Pellegrini used this an opportunity to give many of his starlets some much-needed first team experience.

Despite Jovetic and Dzeko both gladly putting their names on the score sheet, there was some sad news for the Blues as Thierry Ambrose came off injured just eight minutes after coming on at half time.

Ultimately Manchester City will be the happier of the two teams. A good second half display from Manuel Pellegrini's men as they return to England with a 2-0 victory against Hamburg. Next up - Middlesbrough!

Thanks for tuning in everyone!

There is a feeling this game is winding down to a close now. City will be happy with the result, Hamburg not so much after their spritely start to the match.

Jovetic shows his composure to beat the on-rushing Hamburg goalkeeper Rene Adler

Tenacious work from James Milner leads to him crossing the ball for Edin Dzeko, who similarly to Jovetic, controls with his chest and directs the ball into the back of the net.

Sergio Aguero is put through but still has some work to do as the Hamburg defence triple up on him. The limited crowd are going wild every time the Argentine touches the ball.

Jovetic comes off as Aguero comes on to a rapturous applause.

One quirky Manchester City fan skipped a day in the library to be here today. Let's hope his dad isn't watching!

After a good phase of play from Hamburg, Boyata is there to read the game well and cut out a through ball to Gouaida.

Jesus Navas on for Ambrose

There's a slight coming together between Hamburg goalkeeper Adler and and Thierry Ambrose, who is 8 minutes into his first team debut. As the City forward goes for an overhead kick, Adler clatters into him and they both land in a pile. The stretcher is brought on and the 17-year-old is withdrawn as quickly as he was brought on. 

A great long ball from Evans finds Jovetic in the box, who chests and blast home. Adler just fails to do enough to stop it but it rolls in.

Who can break the deadlock? Let's find out shall we?

Relatively dull opening 40 minutes or so. The action only really began with City's double chance and the disallowed Hamburg goal when Stieber's strike was ricocheted in off one of his own players in an offside position.

Kolarov takes an out-swinging corner from the left and Sagna strikes, but it is deflected narrowly wide. A corner is then taken from the other side and it ends up with Jovetic, who tries to curl one into the top corner but it goes just over.

Rafael van der Vaart has a free kick from 30 yards blocked by the wall. The ball rebounds back to the feet of the former Tottenham man, but his half-volley takes a deflection into the thankful hands of Caballero.

Manchester City's James Milner once again drives down the right towards the Hamburg goal, but just before he is able to pull the trigger he is intercepted. City try to work a short corner in the follow up, but it comes to nothing.

Possession mainly being held in the midfield area as we head past the half hour mark. Hamburg still probing away but they are yet to make any real clear cut chances

Patient build up for City this time, who are looking to find a way through the Hamburg midfield.

Mangala is cautioned for a silly tackle on the edge of his own box, but the resulting free kick fails to test the goalkeeper.

Dzeko is slipped through by Barker and he shoots from just inside the box, but it is blocked out for a corner.

James Milner is looking most likely down that right flank as he drills another low ball across the penalty box box Stevan Jovetic fails to meet it at the back stick. The ball falls to Fernando on the edge of the box but his shot is blazed over.

Hamburg are happy to build up play with some patient possession, which ends with Van der Vaart letting rip from 25 yards. Caballero deals with it well.

First real chance of the game goes to City as James Milner squares a ball across the box. But it is cleared for a corner.

The Manchester City players get limbered up ahead of the mid-week friendly clash.

7 min: Rafael van der Vaart finds an opportunity to squeeze in a shot but it merely dribbles towards goal.

The Blues clearly want to show off their domestic prowess as the teams pass the illustrious Premier League trophy.

The City squad turned up in style to the Hazza Bin Zayed Stadium.

The 36-year-old will no doubt want to take this opportunity to prove to Pellegrini that he is fit for a regular starting berth in his title chasing side. 

Hamburg captain Van der Vaart knows Premier League defences well, having played two seasons at Tottenham Hotspur. The Dutchman has three goals for his club this season and will be looking to keep the City midfield quiet.

Manchester City face Hamburg in a specially-arranged midweek friendly at the Hazza Bin Zayed Stadium in Abu Dhabi.

The match will be used as preparation for Hamburg as they gear up for the resumption of their season, while City will use the match to get their players in-tune ahead of their FA Cup match against Middlesbrough.

City boss Manuel Pellegrini has fielded a strong side with the likes of James Milner and Edin Dzeko starting. Will he rue this decision in a meaningless game?
