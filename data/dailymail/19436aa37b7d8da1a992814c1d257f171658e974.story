With its breathtaking river views, neo-Gothic period features and world class location in the heart of London, the Palace of Westminster is the ultimate dream home.

And if housing campaign group Generation Rent gets its way, this could become a reality for hundreds of Londoners, as well as saving the Government £120million over five years.

The organisation has come up with a plan to transform the World Heritage site into 364 affordable flats in a bid to save taxpayers money and relocate Parliament to - Hull. 

As part of the stunt to raise awareness about the lack of social housing, the group said the move would create 500 jobs in a northern town and save millions in staffing costs.

Housing campaign group Generation rent has proposed moving Parliament to Hull and converting the empty buildings into 364 flats

Flats would be available in the historic building for £258 per week for a one-bedroom flat (£1,118 per month), £299 for a two-bedroom (£1,297 per month) and £350 for a three-bedroom (£1,520) under the fantasy scheme.

Architect Jay Morton has made the most of the high ceilings in the plans as these would be split to make room for three-bedroom maisonettes for families. 

Corridors will be transformed into one and two-bedroom flats with windows on both sides.

The iconic debating chambers on the ground floor of the Grade I-listed building would be turned into a swimming pool and a library as the ground floor has been deemed a flood risk. 

Ms Morton, who drew up the plans, said: 'This redevelopment would provide a unique opportunity to renovate the existing fabric of the building and provide much needed accommodation for those who live and work in the city, while re-injecting a community back into the heart of the borough.'

The campaign group is aiming to raise awareness about the lack of social housing and suggest cost-saving measures for the Government.

It suggests relocating MPs and Lords to Hull which boasts the cheapest rent in England with £325 per month for a one-bedroom home.

'This is an idea that will save taxpayers money, help build houses in London and give a disadvantaged northern economy a welcome boost,' according to the plans.

The proposal pointed out that 335 MPs rent second homes and claim expenses, costing the taxpayer £5.21million in 2013. 

Generation Rent also hopes it would create 5,000 badly needed jobs in the disadvantaged northern city.

'It also costs more to employ people in London. If Parliament were located in a cheaper part of the country, there would be annual savings of £20million in reduced employment costs, and the creation of 5,000 badly needed jobs,' said the plans.

Selling  'the prestigious riverfront offices' of Portcullis House, currently home to MP's offices, could also provide a tax windfall of up to half a billion pounds.

Alex Hilton, director of Generation Rent (the operating name of the National Private Tenants Organisation), said it would effectively illustrate  the rent crisis in the capital to MPs.

'Renters are being crushed by high rents, poor conditions and almost no security of tenure.

'With their generous rent allowances from the taxpayer, MPs are cocooned from the housing crisis so they're largely indifferent to the plight of renters.

There is no set site for Parliament to be held in Hull, but the campaign group suggested a derelict site near the station 

'One way our politicians could bear their share of austerity is if we relocated Parliament to the least expensive part of the country. We hope our proposal gives MPs a sense of humility and some urgency to ending the housing crisis.'  

The idea provoked a mixed reaction with some upset only that it will never happen in reality.

Dan Bryant ‏tweeted: 'The idea of moving Parliament to Hull is just brilliant on so many levels.'

Alan Smith, a member of Otley and Yeadon Labour party, said: 'I think face-to-face discussion is important. But I'd definitely vote for parliament moving to Hull. Referendum?'

Sue Brown tweeted: 'Not sure if we want all the MPs to come here to be honest.' 

Tom Coles said: 'Unfortunately don't think this would ever happen.'
