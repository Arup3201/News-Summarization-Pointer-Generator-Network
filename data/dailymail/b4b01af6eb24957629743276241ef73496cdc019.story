Body image issues are the bane of women's lives: we worry about our weight, our skin, our hair - and  about the appearance of our vaginas, according to statistics on the growing popularity of labiaplasty.

In the past decade, cases of genital cosmetic surgery have risen five-fold, with more than 2,000 women now having the procedure on the NHS each year.

But not everyone wants to go under the knife in their quest for the perfect 'designer vagina' - so now, new non-surgical techniques are launching which promise the results of labiaplasty without the pain and recovery time.

Business development manager Lindsey Price, 41, was unhappy with the appearance of her vagina, so tried out one new non-surgical procedure which claims to remodel labia left stretched by the trauma of childbirth using a combination of radio frequencies and ultrasound.

Lindsey had a difficult experience during labour with her son and needed extensive stitches after the birth, which left her scarred, affecting both her confidence and sex life.

As a result, Lindsey felt insecure and inhibited in the bedroom with husband William.

'I'd had a fairly uneventful pregnancy with my son Xavier, with the labour itself even being pretty low-key. 

'It wasn't until the birth itself that the problems started - my son's head got stuck and I ended up having to have a ventouse [forceps] delivery. 

'Unfortunately the suction device didn't work, and I was given an episiotomy as a last resort, leaving me with over 50 stitches and in a lot of pain.'

'Due to the cuts administered when giving birth, my inner and outer labia were a mess. I'd expected everything to heal and go back to normal, but I was left with an untidy looking area that made me feel self-conscious. 

'My confidence, which prior to pregnancy had been high, vanished, and our sex life started to suffer.'

Lindsey became aware of a new technology, which is due to be unveiled to the medical community this October and is a non-invasive option to the surgical intervention known as labiaplasty, which can cost over £3,000 and involves recovery time.

This new technique remodels labia left stretched by the trauma of childbirth using a combination of radio frequencies and ultrasound.

The FDA and CE-approved technique gives results in just four  sessions, and has been shown in clinical studies to also increase sexual libido.

Radio frequency skin tightening is not a new technique, but this is the first time that it has been used for the purposes of labia remodelling.

The treatment takes just 12 minutes, during which a water-based gel is applied to the skin, and the device, which emits an electrical current, is applied to the skin of the labia.

This current encourages the production of new collagen and elastin, which tightens the skin and enhances the appearance of the labia.

Although a side effect of the application of radio frequencies and ultrasound is heat, it is not  uncomfortable.

'I was dubious when she told me it was both painless and fast-acting, so I was honestly gobsmacked when I started to see results after just one treatment.

Lindsey, here with baby Xavier and husband William,  underwent a new non-invasive procedure to reverse the damage that childbirth had done, seeing results quickly, as well as an increased libido  

'I feel like I have my body back and my husband has his wife back,' Lindsey says triumphantly.

'Our sex life has improved ten-fold which I think is not only due to improved appearance and sensitivity down there, but also the renewed confidence it's given me. 

'I've honestly never felt sexier and my libido is higher than ever.'

Gynaecology and aesthetics nurse, Elizabeth Daley of Pureskin Clinic, Alderley Edge, where Lindsey had her procedure - says: 'Many women experience changes in their genitals that result in hypertrophy – an increase in volume – of the labia minora, either during puberty or later in life, perhaps following childbirth.

'This can result in psychological suffering as they feel they look abnormal, or they may experience physical discomfort during activities such as cycling or horse riding. 

'Previously, invasive surgery was the only option, which can be painful and takes weeks to heal. Intima is a world-first, and we can now offer a simple solution, with minimal pain and no recovery time.'

Paul Banwell, Director of the Banwell Clinic, a specialist in this field and British Association of Aesthetic Plastic Surgeons spokesperson, says: 'There is no doubt that labiaplasty surgery is on the rise

'Suitable patients may derive significant physical and psychological benefits and I have personally seen huge patient satisfaction in my practice. However, it is a delicate procedure and it is imperative that patients are counselled properly and have access to a psychologist if required.

'The primary concern for most girls is stretching or enlargement of the labia and the best way to approach this problem is surgery. Furthermore, careful assessment of the anatomical variations is essential to implement a tailor-made plan.

'Radio frequency is excellent technology but it has its limitations and while this new machine seems attractive and may derive some benefit in a small minority, it is unlikely to address the majority of patient's concerns. I would be interested to see long-term results.

'I would definitely recommend patients contemplating labiaplasty procedures seek the help of an experienced plastic surgeon who specialises in this area' 

Intima will be available at the exclusive PureSkin clinic in Alderley Edge in Cheshire, and will be presented at the Clinical Cosmetic and Reconstructive Expo in London this October
