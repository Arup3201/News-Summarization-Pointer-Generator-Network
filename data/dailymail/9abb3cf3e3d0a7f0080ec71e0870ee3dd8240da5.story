Cancer survival rates in Britain still lag well behind many other European countries, a study shows.Survival rates for nine out of ten common cancers are lower than the European average, despite improvements in diagnosis and treatment.

And the discrepancy is even worse among elderly sufferers. Patients with nearly all forms of the disease are more likely to die in Britain compared with patients in France, Germany, Spain and Scandinavia.

Our survival rates for cancers such as breast, prostate, bowel and lung are on a par with former states of the Eastern bloc including Estonia, the Czech Republic and Slovakia. The figures suggest that age discrimination for cancer treatment is worse in Britain compared to elsewhere in Europe.

There is increasing concern that sufferers in their 70s and 80s are being written off by doctors.Ciaran Devane, chief executive at Macmillan Cancer Support, said: ‘This is truly depressing.

One in two of us will get cancer in our lifetime so this is a big deal and has to be a wake-up call for the NHS.

There is no reason why the UK should lag
 behind the rest of Europe when it comes to either certain cancers or 
survival rates for older cancer patients.’

The new data is from a major European study of 10million cancer patients in 29 countries between 2000 and 2008.

For breast cancer, it found that British women have a 79 per cent chance of surviving five years, compared with 86 per cent in France, 87 per cent in Finland, 85 per cent in Norway and 82 per cent on average.

Only 9 per cent of lung cancer patients in the UK live beyond five years, compared with the 13 per cent average, 17 per cent in Austria and 15 per cent in Sweden.

For prostate cancer, just under 81 per cent of patients in Britain live beyond five years. The rate is 90 per cent in Finland and 89 per cent in France.

Around 68 per cent of over-75s with breast cancer survive beyond five years, compared with 75 per cent across Europe.

About 45 per cent of men over 85 with prostate cancer live for at least five years. The average is 58 per cent.

Researchers are unclear as to why our survival rates are so much lower but it may be because the disease is often diagnosed too late when it has spread to other organs.

It might be that GPs are missing certain symptoms while at the same time patients are reluctant to make appointments as they don’t want to be a nuisance.

But NHS England, which runs the health service, said the data, published in the Lancet, showed some improvements – particularly in lung and skin cancer.

Over the past 13 years the NHS has invested millions on various cancer strategies to improve diagnosis rates and make the public more aware of symptoms.

Sean Duffy, National Clinical Director for Cancer at NHS England said: ‘These reports show that we are making real inroads into improving cancer survival in England.

‘For example, the improvement in survival in lung cancer has been dramatic over the last 20 years with almost twice as many patients alive a year after diagnosis now as was the case in 1990 and we can see that for melanoma (skin cancer) that the survival for England – 85.3 per cent – is better than the European average, 83.2 per cent.’

But Drew Lindon, head of policy at Prostate Cancer UK, said: ‘There is a shadow to this story. While prostate cancer survival rates have improved compared to other cancers, beneath the surface we see worrying indications that Britain is lagging behind the European average on survival rates.’
