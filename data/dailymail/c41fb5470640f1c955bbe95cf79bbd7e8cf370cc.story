Police have launched an international manhunt for a lodger after the bodies of a mother and daughter were found at the house where he lived.

The two women, named as Angela Holgate, 54, and Alice Huyton, 75, were found at 5.45pm on Saturday at the property in Southport, Merseyside.

Detectives are treating the deaths as unexplained but believe a man who also lived at the address has now gone abroad.

Wanted: Merseyside Police have asked lodger Barry Morrow, 51, to contact them to help with their enquiries over the double death

Probe: Forensic officers investigate the house where the bodies of two women were found in Southport late on Saturday afternoon

It is thought the two women may have been strangled or suffocated.

Officers want to speak to Barry Morrow, 51, and have urged him to get in contact.

Mr Morrow, thought to be an engineer by profession, is understood to have links to France and Spain.

He is described as white, 5ft 7in, of medium to stocky build with straight, short brown hair that is receding and blue eyes.

Mrs Huyton was last seen on Friday evening when she left her home in Southport to visit her daughter, who had been ill recently and had not been seen out of the house for some time.

Search: Officers enter the house near a black garage following the grim discovery on Saturday

She was married and her husband, thought to be in his 80s, was said to be 'devastated' at news of the deaths.

Ms Holgate's white Citroen with the registration PN11 RWK is also missing.

Chief Superintendent Nikki Holland, area commander for Sefton, said: 'We are investigating the tragic deaths of these two women and our sympathy goes to their families.

'Detectives are investigating the circumstances around these deaths and are trying to piece together the women's last movements.

Find: Police are also investigating the whereabouts of Ms Holgate's white Citroen car, which also went missing after the bodies were found

'We are appealing to anyone with any information that may help us with this investigation to come forward as soon as possible.

'In particular we are keen to trace 
Mr Morrow, who lived at the house for a period of time and who we 
believe may have vital information for this investigation.'

Forensic experts are examining the 
scene, officers are carrying out house-to-house inquiries and have 
stepped up high-visibility patrols.

Stunned neighbours described Ms Holgate as a 'lovely, quiet woman'.

She had lived in the smart, two-storey semi for around 20 years, raising her two daughters who are both understood to be aged in their 20s.

The one-time Avon Lady was divorced from their father several years ago, neighbours said.

Mr Morrow was first seen at the address earlier this year. He had recently re-paved the front garden and driveway.

A neighbour who stopped to compliment him on the work said: 'I told him he was doing a good job and he told me he was the lodger.

'He was very powerfully built, he could lift the flagstones with one hand.

'I haven't the faintest idea what could have happened. It's very worrying.'

Another resident said there were no police sirens or signs of emergency after the bodies were found last night.

Witnesses or anyone with information should call detectives on 0151 777 3165 or Crimestoppers on 0800 555 111.
