Police are on the hunt for a methodical serial killer responsible for at least three killings with the same .22 caliber handgun over the last four months.

The .22 Caliber Killer's latest victim, a New 
York City boutique owner was shot to death in the head Friday night with the same gun
that killed two other shopkeepers in the same borough over the summer.

Ballistics tests matched in each killing, all of which occurred in Brooklyn shops with an '8' in the address.

Suspect: Following one homicide at a 99 cent store that used the same gun, police released this sketch of the suspect

A sketch of the killer has been released after a witness told police he noticed a disturbed man at a previous victim's store just before a body was discovered, muttering to himself about putting a bullet in someone's head.

He is said to be roughly 5-foot-5 and around 140 pounds.

The Daily News reports that the shop owner Vahidipour Rahmatollah of Great Neck was behind the counter of She She in Brooklyn's 
Flatbush section when he was shot Friday night.

The gunman
dragged the victim's body toward the back of the store and covered it 
with clothing.

Murdered: Vahidipour Rahmatollah was killed with thre gunshots, but it seems nothing was stolen from his shot

Police found the 78-year-old with two gunshot wounds to the head and one to the torso, DNA Info reported.

On the floor of the shop were the killer's calling card: shell casings matching casings left at the scenes of the last two homicides.

'Now it's like he's telling us, 'It's me again,'' a police source told the New York Daily News.

casings that police have matched to two other murders.

“Now it’s like he’s telling us, ‘It’s me again,’ ” a police source said.

The way Rahmatollah's body was hidden was also consistent with the previous shootings.

On July 6, Mohammed Gebeli, 65, was found shot through the neck in his Bay Ridge clothing shop. His body was also hidden.

Police believe the methodical killer does this to buy himself more getaway time by delaying the discovery of the bodies.

'I hope they catch the son of a b****,' Gebeli's son, Mourad said.  

When Rahmoatollah didn't come home at the usual time Friday his family called the police, who discovered his body.

It wasn't not clear if the killer actually took anything, or if the murder was his sole motivation.

'He never had in his whole life one enemy, he didn't have, he was a very
kind man,' his sobbing wife, Naima Rahmatollah, told reporters.

Saturday he was supposed to be at his grandson’s Bar Mitzvah.

Victims: Isaac Kadare and Mohammed Gebeli were killed by the same handgun earlier this year

Police believe the murderer had been 
watching the store in preparation for the attack, noting that he'd 
chosen a shop with no security cameras.

Issac Kadare, 59, was found dead in his Bensonhurst store at 1877 
86th St., was shot in the head and stabbed in the neck.

Besides owning stores, each victim was of Middle Eastern descent, prompting suspicion the killer could be racially motivated.

It appeared nothing was taken from Rahmatollah's shop but both Kadare and Gebeli had money taken from them, and it remains unclear whether robbery is a motive.

Unguarded: believe the killer was attracted to the store because, as with previous crime scenes, there were no cameras

Fernando Mateo of the Bodega Association of the U.S. said they were sending copies of the police sketch to their members but were mostly concerned with those fitting the previous victim's description.

'The only members that we would be concerned about are Middle Easterners,' he said.

It's also possible the killer has a fascination with numerology, as the address for each homicide includes the number 8: Kadare at 1877 86th St., Gebeli at 7718 5th Ave., and Rahmatollah at 834 Flatbush Ave.

None of the stores had working surveillance cameras.

Scene: Police believe the killer may have been casing the shop, as it had no security cameras to catch him in the act

Neighbors called Rahmoatollah a 'neighborhood staple.'

'He was a regular guy,' said customer Xanius Patterson. 'He never hurt nobody.'

Police are offering $12,000 for any information leading to the killer's arrest and conviction.
