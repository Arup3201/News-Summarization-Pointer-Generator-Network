Victim: James May, 76, was taken to hospital after collapsing while playing bowls. He seemed to recover, but then died suddenly

A hospital worker was arrested on suspicion of murder after a patient who was expected to be let home suddenly died.

James May, 76, was taken to hospital after collapsing while playing bowls, but he quickly seemed to recover and was kept in as a precaution.

But in the middle of the night, Mr May, who was described by friends and family as fit and active, died after an alleged drug overdose was administered.

A middle-aged man, who is a member of the medical staff at the James Paget University Hospital in Gorleston, Norfolk, has been arrested on suspicion of murder and suspended.

A hospital employee yesterday told the Mail she understood the suspect was a nurse.

Mr May, a retired driving instructor who lived in Great Yarmouth, suffered a heart attack while playing short-mat bowls at the village hall in Hemsby, Norfolk, on September 19.

Paramedics treated him at the scene and his condition seemed to improve, but he was taken to hospital for observation.

Helen Farrow, of Hemsby Outdoor Bowls Club, where Mr May also played, said: ‘Someone called for an ambulance and they sorted him out. He was taken to hospital but we understood it was just a matter of checking him over.

As he was leaving the village hall he said, “sorry to be so much trouble” and asked one of the members to make sure his dog was looked after.

‘So everyone was shocked when we were told he died in the early hours the next morning. We thought he would be straight out of hospital. It was terrible.’

Murder scene: the hospital staff member, who has not been named, was arrested on Saturday after patient James May, 76, was found dead

Police 
began an investigation last week after they received an ‘allegation of 
medical malpractice’ in connection with Mr  May’s death.

The
hospital staff member, who has not been named, was arrested on Saturday
after he was asked to voluntarily attend a police station for 
interview.

Detective
Chief Inspector Paul Durham said: ‘We are investigating an allegation 
that a drugs overdose was administered to a patient, leading to his 
death.

It is alleged the victim died after being given an overdose. A hospital employee has told the Mail she understood the suspect was a nurse

‘A
Home Office post-mortem, carried out earlier this week, determined the 
cause of Mr May’s death as heart failure and we now await the results of
further toxicology tests which will help inform our inquiry.’

Christine
Allen, chief executive of the James Paget University Hospitals NHS 
Trust, added: ‘We believe it is an isolated incident and relates to the 
alleged action of a single member of staff.

‘The
member of staff against whom the allegation has been made is absent 
from the trust and will not return until the investigation is 
completed.’

A
staff member, who did not wish to be named, yesterday told the Mail: 
‘We understand the man is a nurse. He unexpectedly stopped coming into 
work a  couple of days ago.’

Yesterday
Mr May’s next of kin, nephew Kevin May, 28, said he was ‘devastated’ 
his uncle had died so suddenly and described him as being ‘as strong as 
an ox’.

‘We
started to arrange his funeral … but out of the blue in the middle of 
last week the police rang to tell me that they were investigating some 
suspicious circumstances and we would have to postpone the funeral.’

He added: ‘I don’t know how or why anyone would ever want to hurt him.’

The suspect was bailed while the investigation continues.

Sorry we are unable to accept comments for legal reasons.
