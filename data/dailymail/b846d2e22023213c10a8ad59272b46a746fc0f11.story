Fifty Shades of Grey has become the best selling book ever in Britain

IT has been panned by critics and is certainly the most talked about book of the year.

And just four months after its publication in book form, Fifty Shades of Grey is outselling Dan Brown’s The Da Vinci Code and JK Rowling’s Harry Potter books, say experts.

EL James’s erotic novel, released as an e-book last June and in book form in April, has sold 5.3million print and digital copies, according to publishers Random House.

The other books in the trilogy, Fifty Shades Darker and Fifty Shades Freed, have sold 3.6million and 3.2million copies.

Industry experts Nielsen Bookscan began compiling figures in 1998, and since 2003 The Da Vinci Code has held the record for the UK’s best-selling book.

It has sold 5.2million copies to date in the UK and the final Harry Potter instalment, The Deathly Hallows, has sold 4.6million, said industry bible The Bookseller.

While Highway Code has sold 4.9 million.

Miss James said: 'My main ambition when I signed the deal with Random House was to see my books in the shops. I simply had no idea they would be so successful and this is totally unexpected.

'The whole process has been both extraordinary and rewarding. I couldn’t be more pleased with the sales and would like to thank everyone involve

Charts editor Phillip Stone said: 
‘I’m surprised at EL James breaking this record. It took Dan Brown the 
best part of a year to sell 5.2million and I didn’t think it could be 
beaten in my lifetime.

Steamy scenes made the publisher's dreams come true: E L James, author of best selling 50 Shades of Grey, cannot believe the staggering success of her books

'Fifty Shades has sold more in just four months.

'It took Dan Brown the best part of a 
year - 50 weeks - to sell 5.2m million and I didn’t think it could be 
beaten in my lifetime.

'50 Shades of Grey has sold more in just four months.'

He
added the success of the trilogy in the UK was in part down to the 
internet hype surrounding it and the fact it had become a 'watercooler' 
topic.

It is understood if global sales are taken into account JK Rowling’s Harry Potter series is still more popular.

Pipped to the post: Author Dan Brown's The Da Vinci Code has been out-sold by the runaway success of the steamy trilogy

E L James’ 50 Shades trilogy follows 
the relationship between a young student and a manipulative billionaire 
and features scenes of sado-masochism and domination.

It comes after the erotic novel 
outsold all seven Harry Potter books on Amazon last week, making author 
E.L. James the website's best-selling writer ever.

It
also became the website's biggest-selling book of all time, eclipsing 
the sales of the previous record holder, 'Harry Potter and the Deathly 
Hallows', by more than two books to one.

Big hits: The second and third books in the trilogy are also hugely popular

Rights
to the book have been sold around the world and the trilogy is being 
published in languages including Albanian, Chinese, Russian, Serbian and
Vietnamese.

The chick-lit era may be over but it seems the huge success of 50 Shades of Grey means 'mummy porn' is set to take over.

Publishers
are hailing it the 'summer of the bonkbuster' with Shirley Conran’s 
classic Lace is being re-released and Mills & Boon launching a new 
eBook erotica series under the banner Twelve Shades of Surrender.

The Fifty Shades trilogy stemmed from EL James' love of the Twilight saga, written by Stephanie Meyer, which tracks the relationship between a vampire and a high school student in America.

After reading the series of books in Christmas 2008, EL James started contributing stories to a fan fiction site dedicated to the novels.

After a while, she moved beyond stories about the two main protagonists, Bella and Edward, and wrote tales based on her own creations.

These were published by an Australia-based social sharing site that also functioned as a publisher, called the Writer's Coffee Shop.

The fascination with Fifty Shades took off from there.

By the time the book was published in America, it went straight into the New York Times' bestsellers list.

A former television executive, EL James lives in West London with her husband and two sons. She has been taken aback by the incredible success of her books which she originally wrote for 'fun'.

It comes as sales of chick lit have slumped with a recent survey by the Bookseller trade bible revealing the top 20 commercial women's fiction authors have slumped by a tenth in comparable sales of their new recent mass market titles against the previous ones.

Mummy porn has taken over as the new must read genre for women.

It has been an unexpected hit with the first novel in the franchise the fastest-selling novel of all time, both digitally and in print, outstripping Dan Brown’s The Da Vinci Code and JK Rowling’s Harry Potter books.

Its availability as an e-book means people have been able to read it unashamedly and all three books have topped the Amazon charts for much of the year.

Last month Mills & Boon launched a £1.99 erotic short story range with a dozen titles such as Going Down, about a young girl finding sexual freedom in Paris, Cuffing Kate, which lays bare fantasises about dominance and submission, and For Your Pleasure, about naughty neighbours.

The company, famed for its romantic stories began publishing more hardcore erotica in 2008, with the Spice paperback series.

But the boom in digital e-readers such as the Amazon’s Kindle, Sony’s Reader, and devices such as the iPad, means such content is more accessible anonymously, prompting them to release a new series.

The revival of Shirley Conran’s Lace, three decades after it was first published and 15 years after it went out of print, is also a nod to the demand from women for books with sexual content designed for them.

It was a huge hit in the 1980s despite the controversy surrounding its explicit content and was made into a mini-series for TV.
