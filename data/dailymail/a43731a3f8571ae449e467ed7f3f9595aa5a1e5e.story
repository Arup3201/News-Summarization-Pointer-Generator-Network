Young England footballer Jack Wilshere was given a public dressing down by his manager after being photographed smoking outside a London nightclub.

The 21-year-old Arsenal midfielder was seen with a cigarette in his mouth the night after his team beat Napoli 2-0 in the Champions League.

The player's agent said that the footballer does not smoke and was holding it 'momentarily as part of a prank'.

But the footballer was criticised by his manager Arsene Wenger ahead of the Gunners' game against West Brom tomorrow.

'I
disagree completely with that behaviour,' he said. 'I don't know really
what happened, so I will need to have a chat with him about that.

'There
are two things - first of all when you are a football player you are an
example and as well you don't do what damages your health.

'The
fact is that you can damage your health at home, you can smoke at home 
and you can drink at home, and nobody sees it, but when you go out 
socially you also damage your reputation as an example.

Jack's night out on Wednesday was part of a team 
bonding session following 
their triumph over the Italian side on Tuesday.

The
club’s hierarchy are also frustrated that they were not made aware the 
picture would be published, despite the fact Wilshere and his 
representatives knew it was about to appear in the public domain.

A spokesman for Wilshere said: ‘Jack 
was with friends and  team-mates. One dared Jack, who does not smoke, to
hold the cigarette momentarily as part of a prank.’

The
England midfielder responded to the criticism by tweeting a picture of 
France legend Zinedine Zidane smoking a cigarette before adding that he does not smoke.
