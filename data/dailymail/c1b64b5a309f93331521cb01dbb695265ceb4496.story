Just 74 percent of respondents knew that the Earth revolved around the Sun, a shocking new study into the scientific knowledge of American has found.

The survey included more than 2,200 people in the United States and was conducted by the National Science Foundation.

Ten questions about physical and biological science were on the quiz, and the average score - 6.5 correct - was barely a passing grade.

ust 74 percent of respondents knew that the Earth revolved around the Sun, a shocking new study into the scientific knowledge of American has found.

Fewer than half (48 percent) knew that human beings evolved from earlier species of animals.

The result of the survey, which is conducted every two years, will be included in a National Science Foundation report to President Barack Obama and US lawmakers.

One in three respondents said science should get more funding from the government.

Nearly 90 percent said the benefits of science outweigh any dangers, and about the same number expressed interest in learning about medical discoveries.

The National Science Foundation said nearly half of all Americans said astrology is either 'very scientific' or 'sort of scientific'.

It said young people in particular were more likely than ever to consider the pseudoscience at least 'sort of' scientific.

'Fewer Americans rejected astrology in 2012 than in recent years,' the 2014 Science and Engineering Indicators study report said.

Is your future in there somewhere? Skepticism of astrology hit an all-time high in 2004, when 66 percent of Americans said astrology was total nonsense.

But each year, fewer and fewer respondents have dismissed the connections between star alignment and personality as fiction, the NSF said.

'In 2012, slightly more than half of Americans said that astrology was 'not at all scientific,' whereas nearly two thirds gave this response in 2010.

'The comparable percentage has not been this low since 1983.'

Skepticism of astrology hit an all-time high in 2004, when 66 percent of Americans said astrology was total nonsense.

But each year, fewer and fewer respondents have dismissed the connections between star alignment and personality as fiction, the NSF said.

It claims the question was 'focused on the publicâ€™s capacity to distinguish science from pseudoscience.'

Young people are also especially inclined to offer astrology scientific legitimacy, with a majority of Americans ages 18 to 24 considering the practice at least 'sort of' scientific, and the 25-34 age group is not far behind them.

According to a new survey by the National Science Foundation, nearly half of all Americans say astrology, the study of celestial bodies' purported influence on human behavior and worldly events, is either "very scientific" or "sort of scientific."

John Besley of Michigan State University, the lead author of the report's chapter on public attitudes toward science, told Mother Jones he thinks we need to wait 'to see if it's a real change' before speculating about what the data really means, but said the data 'popped out to me when I saw it.'

The results come just days after the recent debate between Bill Nye 'The Science Guy' and young-Earth creationist Ken Ham, but reveals perhaps views of what constitute a 'real' science are not as good as researchers had hoped.

By contrast, 92 percent of the Chinese public think horoscopes are untrue.

First Lady Nancy Reagan famously employed the services of an astrologer after the assassination attempt on her husband.

When asked in 1989 whether she thought astrology could be credited for her husband's success at avoiding any further danger, she said: 'I don't really believe it was, but I don't really believe it wasn't.'
