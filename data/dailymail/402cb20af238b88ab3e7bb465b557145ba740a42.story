This enormous smartphone could become the most secure commercially available device in the world, according to its designers.

The BOSS Phone has been developed specifically for security and privacy, integrating Android Lollipop's operating system with software that ensures online anonymity.

The $355 (£234) phone, which has a seven-inch display, routes all of its traffic through The Onion Router, the online network that allows anonymity.

It means that users can upload photographs and videos, use applications and send emails without fear of third parties being able to listen in.

David Briggs, the San Diego-based entrepreneur behind the project to develop the phone, first came up with the idea after he tried but failed to upload a YouTube video while attending his brother's wedding in Turkey.

Tor - short for The onion Router - is a  matrix of encrypted websites that allows users to surf beneath the everyday 
internet with complete anonymity.

It uses numerous layers of security and encryption to render users anonymous online.

Normally, file sharing and internet browsing activity can be tracked by law enforcement through each user's unique IP address that can be traced back to an individual computer.

The Tor network on the Deep Web hides the IP address and the activity of the user.

Most of the Web's information is buried far down on dynamically generated sites, unable to be found or seen by traditional search engines - sites or pages don't exist until created as the result of a specific search.

An Internet search is like dragging a net across the surface of the sea - a great deal of information is caught, but a majority is deep and therefore missed. 

Access to YouTube was blocked for two months after recordings that appeared to be of leaked conversations of Turkish officials discussing Syria appeared there.

Mr Briggs said that he wanted to give people the freedom to use their smartphones without restrictions.

The Onion Router, or Tor as it is also known, uses layers of encryption that can help to defend against traffic analysis.

Mr Briggs, who had developed a prototype of his device and is now seeking support on the crowdfunding site Indiegogo.

He said: 'BOSS Phone is being manufactured with user privacy as a focus.

'The devices will be tested by Tor/Guardian project to determine that the included software is configured correctly.

'This special network and browser is used by everyday people, the military, journalists, law enforcement, activists, and anyone who wants absolutely secure communications and Internet browsing.

'As our mobile devices become more powerful and essential to our daily lives, they’re increasingly used for more valuable tasks, like banking and shopping, and are, therefore, growing exponentially more vulnerable to a wide variety of online predators.

'In order to protect yourself and your family from known and unknown threats, you need to be aware of the range of security risks and how to prevent them. 

'This is exactly why we are using Android 5.0 Lollipop for its encryption capabilities and the Tor network for secure online communication. Both of these open source systems provide the most robust and easy-to-use security available globally.' 

However the use of TOR may be controversial as it is also exploited by criminals and paedophiles to help mask illegal online activities.

The Onion Network software will allow users of the Boss Phone, above, to browse online without fear that their activities are being tracked, but it could mean that it will be ideal for those looking to hide illegal activities

Few people have more call for a secure mobile phone than the leaders of countriEs.

Barack Obama uses a specially modified BlackBerry that was adapted by the US National Security Agency to enhance its encryption.

The US President recently said that he was not allowed to have an iPhone for 'security reasons', suggesting Apple's device is not considered secure.

Angela Merkel, the German Chancellor, apparently has two phones that she uses regularly - a Nokia 6260 Slide that she uses for party matters and a BlackBerry Z10 for state affairs.

The BlackBerry was modified by Dusseldorf-based security company Secusmart, who have fitted it with an encryption chip.

French President Francois Hollande uses an iPhone 5 for personal use, but has been given an ultra-secure Teorem phone with encryption as head of state.

Vladimir Putin, however, is famous for claiming not to own a mobile phone - possibly as a result of his time spent as a KGB spy. 

It houses what is known as the dark net, or deep web, a hidden subsection of the internet that does not show up on searches and is used to share hacked information and trade in drugs and illegal goods.

Recently David Cameron announced a joint special unit from the government spy organisation GCHQ and the National Crime Agency would use the latest technology to hunt down paedophiles who have been using the dark net to share abusive pictures.

Use of The Onion Router may not also guarantee users from having their information hacked as there have been a number of experts who have demonstrated weaknesses in the software.

However, the Boss Phone also comes with additional features, including the ability to use two seperate SIM cards, allowing users to switch between different numbers with different carriers.

Mr Biggs claims the phone will have a battery life of more than 20 hours and its large screen - at seven inches it will be one of the largest phones on the market - should be attractive to those who find small smartphone screens impractical.

He hopes to begin selling commercial models of the Boss Phone by October this year.

He said: 'Lets face it the tiny screens on smartphones are impractical.

'They are useless for almost everything except texting and calling. And even then, if you have big fingers you are in trouble. With the Boss you are not limited by size.'
