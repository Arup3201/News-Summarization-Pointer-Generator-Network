An Australian naval officer appears to have taken on board the old adage of having a girl at every port.

A young man who was in Auckland for a few days recently, wrote postcards to women all around the world, according to The New Zealand Herald.

Known only as Gav, staff at a cafe he regularly visited during his stay in the city assumed the sailor to be in his twenties.

Eight lucky ladies around the world have postcards on the way to them from an Australian sailor with a lot of love to give

He travelled on an Australian Navy ship the HMAS Choules, a vessel formerly known as the Largs Bay when it served as part of the Royal Fleet Auxillary.

On the day of his ships' departure, it is reported the casanova handed a stack of postcards to the owner of Barabra Cafe, Steaffan Ljunggren.

'His ship was leaving ... He nicely asked us 'oh, could you please do [me] a favour, would you mail this for me', owner Mr Ljunggren told the publication.

After taking a peek at the postcards, staff found that amongst the letters to family and friends, there were eight which appeared to be love letters.

Women from Germany, Russia, Latvia and the Ukraine were all being written to with similar sign-offs, ending with the sailor professing his longing and love for each lucky lady.

Many of the short letters finish with 'I miss you', 'I love you' and describe Auckland as a 'small and peaceful city' which reminds him of Sydney.

The casanova's ship was docked at the Princes Wharf in Auckland when he penned his postcards

In one postcard addressed to Yana, Gav wrote 'I wish we could do some exploring together here', while another to Tatiana echoes a similar sentiment with 'I wish you were here with me to explore'.

The postcards were sent on their way, and the naval officer's eight love letters are now sailing the seven seas to each of their special recipients.

Gav's ship was at port at Princes Wharf, a former commercial wharf which has been developed and now houses cruise ships and the likes when they're passing through.

The cafe - Barabra - which means 'all good' in Swedish, is situated right on the water, very close to where the HMAS Choules was docked.
