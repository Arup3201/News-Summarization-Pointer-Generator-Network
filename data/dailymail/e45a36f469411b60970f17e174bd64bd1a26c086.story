A judge sparked outrage by sparing a teenage burglar jail so he could continue with his job clubbing baby seals to death.

Jack Taylor, 18, admitted stealing a 50cc motorcycle from a house because he thought it contained drugs.

But he escaped with community service after a judge heard he had a job as a slaughterman in Norway.

Worcester Crown Court heard he also travels to Alaska and clubs baby seals for a living.

Recorder Edward Coke congratulated Taylor because he had 'got off his backside to work'.

He added: 'I consider it is important for a young man with a girlfriend to be in employment.'

Taylor was given a six-month community order and told to carry out 100 hours unpaid work.

He was also ordered to pay £340 costs, £75 compensation and slapped with a 7pm-7am curfew order for three months.

The teenager had admitted breaking into a garage of a house in Worcester in the early hours of August 19 last year.

The householders heard him and an accomplice dragging a motorcycle along the driveway.

Alex Warren, prosecuting, told the court: 'The bike had been taken from the garage and when the intruders were spotted they ran off, dropping the machine on to the floor and breaking the wing mirror.'

Siobhan Collins, defending, told the court Taylor stole the bike because he believed there were drugs hidden inside.

She said: 'He has just turned 18, has no previous convictions and has worked abroad for some time in Norway as a slaughterhouse man and as a seasonal worker in Alaska culling baby seals.'

The judge stipulated that Taylor should complete the unpaid work in Worcester before he flies back to Norway to continue his job.

Boast: Jack Taylor, 18, wrote on his Facebook page how he earns £16 per hour slaughtering sheep in Norway. He also clubs seals to death in Alaska

Taylor is pictured on his Facebook page in a Norwegian abattoir posing next to a bloodied sheep carcass.

In another picture, a grinning Taylor is seen holding a bone cutting saw used to hack up the animal carcasses.

A friend has commented: 'It's the Worcester bone saw killer lol hows tricks mate.'

Taylor boasted on his profile that he can earn £16 per hour slaughtering up to 5,000 sheep a week.

He wrote: 'a busy week next week thou got to kill about 5000 sheep maybe more but that 8 hours a day every day that get me about 700 800 quid it all good.'

The People for the Ethical Treatment of Animals yesterday condemned the court's decision as 'delusional' and 'downright dangerous'.

Mimi Bekhechi, a manager for PETA, said: 'Imagining that criminals might reform their deviant, anti-social behaviour by bludgeoning baby seals to death not only is delusional, it's also downright dangerous.

'Animal abuse is harmful to all of society. Research in psychology and criminology shows that people who commit acts of cruelty towards animals rarely stop there; many move on to make fellow humans their victims.'
