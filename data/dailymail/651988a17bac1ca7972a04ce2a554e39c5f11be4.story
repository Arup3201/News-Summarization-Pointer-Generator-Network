After Manchester United's Premier League opening defeat to Swansea on Saturday, the murmurs of discontent from the Old Trafford support over the Glazer family's lack of investment in the squad are growing ever louder.

With 12 days remaining in the transfer window, many feel Louis van Gaal's squad is short of the quality required if they are to contend again for the Premier League title.

But just how does United's spending this summer compare to the previous five? Some of you may be surprised.

Former club: Athletic Bilbao

Fee: £29m

After a failed attempt in 2013, United finally captured the signing of Spaniard Ander Herrera from Athletic Bilbao in June. The 24-year-old was van Gaal's first signing, although he first came to the attention of the club more than three years ago through Sir Alex Ferguson's brother Martin.

Luke Shaw (defender)

Former club: Southampton

Fee: £31.5m

England defender Luke Shaw became the world's most expensive teenager when he joined United in June. However, the 19-year-old is currently on the sidelines after suffering a hamstring injury which van Gaal partly blamed on the long pre-season tour of the USA.

Marcos Rojo (defender)

Fee: £16m

Argentina international Rojo will become United's third summer signing when the contract is  signed after Van Gaal had made it a priority to sign a left-footed defender. The 24-year-old touched down in Manchester on Tuesday evening and said joining United 'feels like a dream'.

TOTAL SPENDING: £76.5m

This was the summer of David Moyes' arrival. Gareth Bale, Cristiano Ronaldo and Cesc Fabregas were on the wanted list. In the end, United got Marouane Fellaini in a last-minute £27.5m transfer deadline day deal and defender Guillermo Varela from Uruguyan club Penarol for £2.4m.  

TOTAL: £29.9m

2012

The marquee signing of Ferguson's last summer at United was undoubtedly Robin van Persie from Arsenal for £24m. Shinji Kagawa joined from Borussia Dortmund for £12m, Alexander Buttner of Vitesse Arnhem for £4m and Crewe's Nick Powell for £4m.

TOTAL: £44m

Ferguson's search for a replacement for goalkeeper Edwin van der Sar ended with the capture of Atletico Madrid's David de Gea for £18.9m. A couple of major domestic deals were also done with Ashley Young joining from Aston Villa for £17m and Phil Jones from Blackburn for £16.5m. 

TOTAL: £52.4m

2010

Chris Smalling was United's most expensive buy in the summer of 2010, the defender joining from Fulham for £10m, Ferguson triggered a release clause in Bebe's Vitoria contract with a £7.4m bid and Javier Hernandez signed from Guadalajara for £6m.

TOTAL: £23.4m

2009

After Ronaldo had been sold to Real Madrid in June 2009 for a then-world record transfer fee of £80m, this actually turned out to be a low-spending summer. Luis Antonio Valencia joined from Wigan for £16m and Ferguson also captured Gabriel Obertan (£3m) and Mame Biram Diouf (£3.5m). Free agent Michael Owen was also brought in. 

TOTAL: £22.5m
