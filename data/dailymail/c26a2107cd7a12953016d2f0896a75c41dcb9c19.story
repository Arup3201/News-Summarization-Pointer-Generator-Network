His story divided the nation - and led to him making an appearing on Newsnight to defend his actions.

Now former Great British Bake Off contestant Iain Watters is making it his mission to ensure Christmas puddings don't end up in the same place as his Baked Alaska - the bin.

The 31-year-old lost his place in the BBC baking competition in August when, in a rage, he threw away his ice-cream dessert after it was controversially taken out of the freezer by fellow contestant Diana Beard. 

This years' alternative to Christmas pudding: Belfast baker Iain Watter's chocolate chestnut orange cake

Now, working together with ao.com, the bearded Belfast baker has released a recipe video of this year's alternative to Christmas pudding: a chocolate chestnut orange Christmas cake. 

'If the Christmas pudding at your table isn't going to go down too well with guests, there really is very little point in making one at all,' Mr Watters says in the footage.

'There are plenty of other homemade dessert options that would work wonderfully with a Christmas dinner.'

The 31-year-old worked with shopping website ao.com to release his recipe video 

The recipe - in full below - was created after the shopping website's research revealed a quarter of Britons loathe Christmas pudding. 

The traditional festive staple was ranked fourth in the food most likely to end in the bin after Christmas dinner - and one in five will only eat if it its smothered in brandy sauce or cream. 

Although 12 per cent of Britons will be baking their own pud this year, more than a quarter will be looking for an alternative, less traditional dessert to the Christmas pudding.

Ingredients 

 

125g soft, stoned prunes

75g butter

125g dark chocolate – around 60% cocoa

200g puree chestnuts

100ml double cream

Juice and zest of 1 orange

3 large eggs, separated

125g caster sugar

For the Chocolate cake

3 large eggs 

250g butter

250g caster sugar

250g plain flour 

40g cocoa powder 

 2 ½ tsp baking powder

Juice and zest of 1 orange

For the Chocolate water ganache

250g chocolate 60%

125ml boiling water

For the Italian Meringue

2 egg whites

¼ tsp cream of tartar

110g caster sugar

50ml water

For the Decoration

Cocoa for dusting

Candied chestnuts

Flaked almonds

Method

For the torte: Prepare a 20cm springform tin with non-sticking baking paper and preheat the oven to 170c. Firstly very finely chop and mash the prunes in a food processor and set aside.

In a bain-marie or double boiler, melt the chocolate and butter together. While the chocolate is melting, whisk the chestnut puree and double cream together until you have smooth texture and set aside.

Next, separate the eggs, cream the caster sugar and egg yolks until they become thick and glossy. Now, whisk the whites into soft peaks and set aside.

You should now have five different bowls of ingredients: mix together the eggs and sugar with the chestnut puree, followed by the prunes and then the chocolate mixture. Lightly whisk until well combined.

Finely grate the zest of the orange into the mixture followed by the juice.

To combine the egg whites, first put one big dollop of the whites into the mixture to loosen it. Then gently fold in in the remaining whites until they are all combined.

Pour into the prepared tin and bake for 25 to 30 mins. It should be still slight wobbly in the middle and a few cracks will have appeared. Allow to cool and removed the springform tin and chill for a few hours in the fridge.

For the chocolate cake:  Prepare two 20 cm springform or normal tins with non-stick baking paper.Cream together the butter and sugar until light and fluffy with a hand mixer.

Next sieve the flour, cocoa powder and baking powder into a separate bowl. add all the eggs into the sugar mixture along with the sieved dry ingredients and beat together until well combined.

Finely grate the zest of the orange into the mixture followed by the juice and mix in.

Divide the mixture evenly between the two tins and bake at 170 for 20 mins. Remove the oven and cool on a wire rack.

Once the cakes are half cooled and the torte has chilled, its time to stack them. First place one sponge on top of the torte and flip it over so the sponge is now on the bottom. The torte is quite delicate so this means there is less chance of it breaking up. Now place the second sponge on top of the torte. The torte should now be in the filling of a sponge sandwich.

For the ganache: The ganache is made with water and chocolate not cream. In a bain-marie or double boiler melt the chocolate. While the chocolate is melting boil 125ml of water.

Once melted take the bowl off the heat and pour in about a table spoon of the water in the chocolate, and whisk together. It will look like its separating but keep whisking – it will come together. Then add the remaining water and keep whisking. The ganache will be a bit runny but will thicken up as it cools. While the ganache is still workable, cover the whole cake/torte in the ganache with a palette knife.

For the meringue: In a saucepan, stir the sugar and water together over a medium heat. Dip a pastry brush in water and brush any bits of sugar from the sides of the pan down into the syrup to melt, otherwise it will turn the sugar syrup grainy. When all of the sugar is dissolved, bring it to a fast boil until it reaches 120C/250F.

While the syrup is reaching temperature, whisk the egg whites with the cream of tartar into soft peaks.

As soon as the syrup reaches the correct temperature, pour it onto the egg whites in a thin, steady stream as you whisk. Be careful not to pour the hot syrup directly onto the beaters, as it may stick to them or splash back at you.

When all the syrup has been mixed, continue to whisk the meringue until it has cooled. It should be shiny and stiff and be tepid temperate.

Transfer to a piping bag and with a large nozzle pipe small peaks to the top of the cake, starting around the outside and work your way into the middle.

Dust your serving plate with cocoa and transfer the cake to the plate, finish the top of the cake with finely chopped candied chestnuts and flaked almonds.

The cake will keep for three days in the fridge so can be made in advance.
