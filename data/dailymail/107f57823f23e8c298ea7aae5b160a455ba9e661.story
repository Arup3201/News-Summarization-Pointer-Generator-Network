A baker who stole 11 tons of flour from his employers and sold it on the cheap has avoided jail.

Julian Owen, 46, and his accomplice Gary Beswick, 47, responsible for transporting the £3,569-worth of flour, were handed suspended jail terms.

The pair, who initially pleaded not guilty to theft, were said to have taken advantage of Owen’s position in a joint venture without their employer knowing.

Mr Owen ordered the flour, which could have made 
18,200 loaves of bread, on the company 
accounts, but it never arrived at the bakery.

Russell
Gibbon, who took over the family business eight 
years ago, said that he did not suspect anything at first as Mr Owen ran 
the bakery well and had a ‘job for life’.

Mr Owen was eventually found out when he went on holiday and the bakery was running short of flour.

Mr Gibbon, 52, said invoices were coming in and he found out that someone had been picking up flour on a regular basis from the supplier, Hovis.

After confronting his employees, Owen ‘got a bit heated’ and walked away from the business.

Defence
counsel for Mr Owen, Steven Thomas, said the theft caused little harm to 
the business and the offence happened over a short period of time.

Mr Beswick, representing himself, described the crime as a ‘silly act’ and not something he would normally do.

Judge Rhys Rowlands said the pair devised a scheme to order ‘significant quantities’ of flour, breaching the trust put in Owen by his employer.

Mr Owen received a sentence of eight months in prison suspended for two years, while his accomplice Beswick was handed 6 months, suspended for the same period.

The crooks will each have to pay £1,750 in compensation to the bakery, plus £750 prosecution costs and carry out 300 hours of unpaid work.

Mr Gibbons added: ‘At the end of the day, I think he was very silly. He had a job for life and was on good money, a company phone and pretty flexible working hours,’

‘It’s quite upsetting to be deceived. I was let down by somebody I trusted, he let down the company down, he let himself down and it was just a shame it happened.’
