With the demand to produce toys in time for Christmas, Chinese factory workers are being forced to work long hours and sleep on factory floors, among piles of doll parts.

In recent years, human rights campaigners have frequently raised concerns over the conditions of Chinese factory workers who make an estimated £150 a month.

These images give a stark insight into the monotonous life endured by thousands of Chinese factory workers in the country which makes 75 per cent of the world's toys, including well-known characters such as Mickey Mouse and SpongeBob SquarePants.

Abuses: With the pressure to produce toys in time for Christmas, factory workers in China are forced to work long hours and sleep in the factory

Working hard: Human rights campaigners have frequently raised concerns over the conditions of Chinese factory workers who make an estimated £150 a month

A report in 2010 reported that the 
average monthly salary, including overtime, for a migrant worker was 
estimated to be just £150.

Across China there are an estimated 8,000 toy-making factories employing 3.5 million people.

According to New York-based China 
Labour Watch Chinese factory workers often work an extra 36.5 hours a 
week but are paid only 59 per cent of the minimum wage.

The non-profit organisation that assesses production 
factories say that while conditions have improved for workers after 
factories implemented a code of conduct, the abuses still continue.

A report in 2009 revealed that one million Chinese factory workers suffered industrial accidents in that year alone.

In 2010, human rights organisation 
the National Labour Committee released photos of workers asleep on their
 stations making computer mice and web cams for an American 
multinational computer company.

Employed for gruelling 15-hour 
shifts, in appalling conditions and 86f heat, many fall asleep on their 
stations during their meagre ten-minute breaks.

For as little as 34p an hour, the men and women work six or seven days a week at the KYE Systems factory at Dongguan, China.

This photo and others like it were 
smuggled out of the KYE Systems factory at Dongguan, China, as part of a
 three-year investigation by the National Labour Committee (NLC), a 
human rights organisation which campaigns for workers across the globe.

According to NLC the mostly female 
workers, aged 18 to 25, work from 7.45am to 10.55pm, sometimes with 
1,000 workers crammed into one 105ft by 105ft room.

Hard work, little money: A report in 2010 reported that the average monthly salary, including overtime, for a migrant worker was estimated to be just £150

They are not allowed to talk or 
listen to music, are forced to eat substandard meals from the factory 
cafeterias, have no bathroom breaks during their shifts and must clean 
the toilets as discipline, according to the NLC.

The workers also sleep on site, in 
factory dormitories, with 14 workers to a room. They must buy their own 
mattresses and bedding, or else sleep on 28in-wide plywood boards. They 
'shower' with a sponge and a bucket.

Samsung also came under fire last
 month after it was claimed that employees at one of its suppliers are 
made to work up to 16 hours a day, with only one day's rest a month.

The claim will pile pressure on the 
South Korean electronics giant to address working practices after it 
admitted excessive overtime and fines for employees in China.

Samsung, which is the world's largest
 maker of cell phones and televisions, said that a review of 105 of its 
Chinese suppliers - involving more than 65,000 employees - found illegal
 work practices, but said the companies involved would be given two more
 years to change their ways.

China Labor Watch said employees at 
one of Samsung's suppliers sometimes worked up to 16 hours a day, and 
were given just one day off each month.

German photographer Michael Wolf took these photos during visits to five factories in mainland China.

Wolf decided to exhibit his photos 
surrounded by 16,000 second hand toys he purchased from flea markets and stores around California, in America.

The toy's were shipped back to his studio in Hong Kong where the back of each one was sanded down so he could attach a magnet.

It took three people 10 hours per day for three days to install the toys on an exhibiting wall.

The project involved 40 cans of black spray paint, 45,000 magnets and 45m sq of wall space.
