Russia’s elections commission said Tuesday that a prominent opposition leader will be disqualified from running for president in March, a move that would prevent his party from fielding observers.

Russian news agencies quoted elections commission secretary Nikolai Konkin as saying that the body would formally block Grigory Yavlinsky from the ballot later this week, after finding that hundreds of thousands of the signatures submitted on his nominating petition were invalid.

Yavlinsky the leader of Russia’s leading liberal party said Monday that election officials’ refusal to clear his candidacy for March’s presidential election reflects the government’s fear of genuine competition.

He said authorities want to prevent him from challenging Prime Minister Vladimir Putin’s bid to extend his 12-year rule by reclaiming the presidency.

Adding that the Prime Minister's other contenders are only nominal rivals who are following the Kremlin’s guidance.

Yavlinsky is a leader of the liberal Yabloko party and a critic of Prime Minister Vladimir Putin, who is seeking a return to the presidency in the March 4 election.

Opposition: Grigory Yavlinksy's party fielded thousands of election observers in the December election who documented evidence of fraud in favor of Putin's United Russia party

But the rejection of his candidacy is likely to sharpen political tensions that have been brewing since last month’s unprecedented massive protests sparked by alleged fraud in parliamentary elections.

Although Yavlinsky has not been a key 
figure of those protests, his party fielded thousands of election 
observers in the December election who documented evidence of fraud in 
favor of Putin’s United Russia party.

Political analyst Mikhail Rezimov told the state news agency RIA Novosti: 'Yavlinsky
does not have so many supporters, but the negative effect of this 
decision will be much wider than the dissatisfaction of Yavlinsky 
supporters and will give reason to speak, including in the West, of a 
managed election.'

Head of 
Yabloko, Sergei Mitrokhin, said in a statement: 'We insist that all the 
signatures submitted to the Central Elections Commission in support of 
Yavlinsky’s nomination are real, the real signatures of citizens.'

Yabloko
has not had any seats in the parliament since 2007. Politicians who 
want to run for president but whose parties are not in parliament must 
submit 2 million signatures in support of their candidacy.

Konkin
said that examinations of about 600,000 of the signatures submitted to 
support Yavlinsky’s nomination found some 25 per cent of them to be 
invalid, largely because the signatures were photocopied.

That is higher than the five per cent rejection level allowed by law.
