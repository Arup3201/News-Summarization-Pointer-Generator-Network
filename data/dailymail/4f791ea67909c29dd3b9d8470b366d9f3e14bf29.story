A new treatment developed by British scientists could significantly improve the ability of radiotherapy to save the lives of cancer patients.

More than 50 per cent of people with cancer are treated with radiotherapy, which kills tumour cells and boosts the body’s own ability to fight off the disease.

But its success is limited by the ability of some cancer cells to become resistant to the treatment.

Those resistant cells stubbornly survive and in some cases can grow into new tumours.

Now scientists at the University of Manchester have discovered the reason why radiotherapy does not always work - and they have worked out a way to boost its success.

Scientists have discovered that radiotherapy does not always kill all cancer cells because a protein called PD-L1 forms a 'molecular shield' around some cancer cells which go on to grow into tumours

The findings, published this morning in the journal Cancer Research, could significantly boost the power of radiotherapy, potentially saving countless lives.

Pharmaceutical firm AstraZeneca is already starting large clinical trials in a bid to turn the discovery into a widely-available treatment.

Dr Simon Dovedi, who led the Manchester team, said the breakthrough had come with the discovery of a ‘molecular shield’ which helped cancer cells survive the radiotherapy treatment.

The shield – a protein called PD-L1 – tricks the body’s defences into thinking that cancerous cells pose no threat.

Dr Dovedi and his colleagues found that injecting an antibody into the blood stream of mice could block the PD-L1 protein, destroying the shield and allowing the cancer cell to be killed.

It is now being tested in humans and Dr Dovedi is confident of further promising results.

He said: ‘This treatment is being tested in clinics already. We hope we can reduce the rate of people who see their cancer return after radiotherapy.

‘These are very exciting discoveries.’

Dr Dovedi, whose team was funded by Cancer Research UK and AstraZeneca, said: ‘One of the ways that radiotherapy works is that it stimulates the body’s immune response against cancer cells.

‘But in some cancers patients with higher levels of this PD-L1 protein go on to do quite poorly.

‘It provides a molecular shield to the cancer cells, providing an immune escape so the body does not realise the cells are a threat.’

The new antibodies work by stopping the PD-L1 protein from working, allowing the immune system to destroy them.

Researchers discovered that injecting an antibody could block the PD-L1 protein, destroying the shield and allowing the cancer cells to be killed. They called it an 'exciting discovery'

PD-L1 proteins have been discovered in some patients with lung cancer, skin cancer and bladder cancer - and they may be active in other forms of cancer.

Dr Dovedi added: ‘Combining certain immunotherapies with radiotherapy could make them even more effective and we’re now looking to test this in clinical trials to see just how much of a difference it could make.’

Professor Nic Jones, Cancer Research UK’s chief scientist, said: ‘Around half of all cancer patients are given radiotherapy and it has been at the heart of helping improve survival rates so that today one in two cancer patients will survive for at least ten years.

‘Doctors and researchers are constantly looking for ways to improve treatments and this approach could open the door to a whole new way of giving radiotherapy.’

Dr Robert Wilkinson, director of oncology research at MedImmune - the research arm of AstraZeneca - added: ‘MedImmune is committed to developing strong science led collaborations, and supporting research that helps further advance our scientific understanding in the important area of immunotherapy.

‘The findings described in the recent study with Cancer Research UK are extremely encouraging.’
