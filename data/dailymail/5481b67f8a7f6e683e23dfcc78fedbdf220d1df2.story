A couple who met while playing a game online have just celebrated a decade of married life together and are 'living happily ever after'.

Claire Nelson, from Wales, met American husband Shane while playing a golf game on Xbox Live and spent the next year talking and playing with the US gamer.

As a way to relax the Cardiff mother-of-two would play on her children's games console after they had gone to bed but she never guessed her hobby would change her life.

Claire Nelson and husband Shane are celebrating ten years of marriage after meeting on Xbox Live 

One night Claire, 40, who played Links 2004 with online friends, was introduced to Shane, 39, who was playing across the pond in Springfield, Missouri.

Claire, a medical assistant, says that she immediately knew she wanted to be more than just friends. 'We had a mental connection and knew we wanted to be together right way.

She told news-leader.com: 'One evening we were waiting for a fourth player to join our game, then there he was, a player named Tungfu (his real name Shane). He was quiet and only spoke a few times. It turned out that the “friends” I was playing with were Shane’s friends too but this was the first time that we “met".

'I knew he was American from his accent. (I forgot to mention I lived in Wales UK ). We were all chatting and I stated that “I wish I could find someone to romance me and I romance them.” 

'Shane cut in with “Darn girl where do YOU live?” We knew there was a connection and we talked every night and on the weekends for nine months.'

Because of the time difference between Wales and Missouri, with Claire being six hours ahead, it would be the early hours of the morning when Shane returned from work and was available to talk but she didn't mind.

The pair married in 2005 after Claire flew to Springfield in US to propose to Shane 

Shane traveled to Wales to wed Claire in 2006 and had another internet gamer as their best man 

Claire said: 'We hit it off - over the next few months I'd fall asleep with my Xbox headset on and wait for Shane to get home from work and join the game. He'd wake me up and we'd talk all night.' 

They discussed 'everything' including Shane coming to live with her, marriage and babies. 

Although they shared a strong connection Claire said that it was difficult to have such a long distance relationship where they were more 3,000 miles away from each other.

'We dated online for over a year - it was very hard, we lived an ocean apart.' 

One year later, the couple decided to meet in person, with Claire, 40, flying to Springfield.

On the first night she proposed to Shane, 39, a diesel mechanic, with a diamond ring.

She added: 'I knew he would say "yes".'

The couple, who have a seven-year-old son together named Riley, tied the knot in Wales in 2006, with another internet gamer acting as Shane's best man.

They stayed there until the following year when they all boarded a plane to Springfield, where they've lived ever since.  

Claire has since moved to Springfield where the couple live with their children. They are pictured here with Claire's two children from a previous marriage 

Claire, Shane, Riley and Claire's two children from a previous marriage now live in Springfield together.

Since her wedding Claire revealed two of her friends have also had successful online relationships with one couple are married and the other couple are due to wed.

Claire says that the world of online gaming allows you to meet people that you wouldn't otherwise come across.

'The best part about online gaming is that you get to make friends all over the world.

'We are living happily ever after. It's been my fairy tale come true.'

She told news-leader.com: 'It was not an easy journey but it was all worth it. We both believe we have found our soulmate.' 

 The happy couple have since had a son of their own Riley (pictured centre) 

Since their wedding two of Claire's friends have also had success with online relationships
