Jailed mobster James 'Whitey' Bulger is to appeal his conviction on charges including 11 murders less than a week after he was handed two life sentences for his crimes, his lawyers claim.

The 84-year-old former leader of Boston's Winter Hill gang is expected to die in prison after being convicted in August for gangland 
crimes in the 1970s and 80s including racketeering, extortion and drug dealing.

Bulger's lawyers have said he believes his trial was a 'sham' because he wasn't allowed to argue that a now-deceased federal prosecutor gave him immunity to commit crimes.

Appeal: James 'Whitey' Bulger upon his arrest in Santa Monica, California, on June 22, 2011. He had been on the run for 16 years

He was sentenced Nov. 14 to two consecutive
life terms after a two-day hearing at which families of his victims 
vented their anger, and Judge Denise Casper castigated him for 'almost 
unfathomable depravity.'

In
a brief, two-page filing in U.S. District Court in Boston, Bulger, who 
was arrested in California in 2011 after spending 16 years on the run, said he was appealing the jury's verdict.

Before the trial, U.S. District Judge Denise Casper had prevented his lawyers from mounting the case that the he had been granted immunity for his crimes, reasoning that no immunity deal would allow a person to commit murder.

During
the two-month trial, Bulger's lawyers said that their client had been 
an 'organized criminal' and spent much of their energy arguing that he 
had never served as an informant to the Federal Bureau of Investigation.

Prosecutors
and government witnesses said during the trial that corrupt FBI agents 
who shared Bulger's Irish ancestry turned a blind eye to his crimes as 
he ruled over Boston's criminal underworld in the 1970s and 80s, in 
exchange for information they could use against the Italian-American 
Mafia.

Bulger declined to testify in his own defense during his trial, telling the judge he regarded the proceedings as 'a sham.'

The FBI used these projections of James 'Whitey' Bulger during their 
hunt to find him. He was one of America's most wanted men, on the run 
for 16 years

Prior
to the trial, Bulger's attorneys were successful in appeals court in 
getting the judge originally assigned to the case, Richard Stearns, 
pulled off it.

They 
challenged Stearns' impartiality, noting that he had worked for the U.S.
Attorneys' office in Boston when prosecutors were developing the case 
against Bulger.

Bulger fled 
Boston in 1994 on a tip that arrest was imminent and spent 16 years on 
the lam before the FBI caught up with him in June 2011, living in a 
seaside apartment in Santa Monica, California.

His story inspired Martin Scorsese's 2006 Academy Award-winning film 'The Departed'.

For years he was portrayed as a Robin Hood figure who 
bought Thanksgiving turkeys for working-class South Boston residents and
kept hard drugs out of the neighborhood.

But that image was shattered when authorities started digging up bodies more than a decade ago.

Prosecutors
at his two-month trial portrayed him as a cold-blooded, hands-on boss 
who killed anyone he saw as a threat, along with innocent people who 
happened to get in the way.

Connolly was 
later convicted of second-degree murder in Florida for leaking 
information to Bulger that led to the slaying of a gambling executive.

Speaking after the trial, Tommy 
Donahue, the son of murder victim Michael Donahue, told reporters he had
waited 31 years for someone to pay for his father's death.

'That old bastard is finally going to be in prison, he's going to die in prison,' Donahue said.

'It’s bittersweet but it’s a damn good feeling.

'The next time I ever want to hear anything about him, I hope he’s dead.'

Former Boston FBI agent John Connolly
Jr. — Bulger's handler when he was an informant — was sentenced to 10 
years in prison after being convicted of tipping him off ahead of an 
indictment.
