Football gatherings for the next several weeks may be cursed with lumpy cheese dips thanks to a shortage of smooth-melting party favorite Velveeta.

Kraft Foods says they're running low on the American-style cheese product and the drought could continue for the next few weeks.

That means millions of Americans planning their Super Bowl soirees could be facing a seriously cheesy conundrum.

Smooth move: Kraft has announced there's a shortage of its popular, smooth-melting cheese product Velveeta just as demand ticks up for NFL playoffs and the Super Bowl

'It is possible consumers may not be able to find some Velveeta products on store shelves over the next couple of weeks,' Kraft spokeswoman Jody Moore said Tuesday.

Though not currently widespread, football playoffs and the impending Super Bowl on February 2 mean the shortage will affect more consumers than it would during other times of year.

'This is really a short-term issue that's more noticeable right now, given the increased seasonal demand,' Moore said.

New of the impending processed 
cheesepocalypse generated a minor tempest on Twitter after Advertising 
Age reported a possible shortage, quoting an unnamed employee of an 
unnamed Brooklyn-area grocery as saying that no further shipments were 
expected until February due to 'a plant issue.'

Kraft,
 however, did not name the cause of the shortage and said only it is due
 to the 'nature of manufacturing' and the ever more vague 'combination 
of factors.'

The conspicuous timing of the shortage, insists Kraft, is as much a thorn in the food behemoth's side as it is for dip lovers.

And it certainly isn't a ploy to encourage a nationwide dash to the super market for Velveeta.

'This is not a marketing/advertising campaign,' Moore said.

Not everyone is convinced.

'It's
 not a seasonal product,' culinary historian Ken Albala told USA Today. 
'The whole point of Velveeta is you keep it on the shelf indefinitely. 
It's the cheese for people who don't know how to cook.'

For the more adept chef, there's always good old cheddar.

Not that anyone has complained about a dearth of the two-pound loaves yet.

'We have not heard many complaints from consumers so far,' Moore said.

Kraft introduced the food it dubbed a 'pasteurized prepared cheese product' on June 2, 1928.

The orange loaves were wrapped in foil and originally sold in wooden boxes.

The company marketed the product as a smooth-melting, housewife-friendly alternative to traditional cheese that could be mixed with milk, melted, and poured 'over toasted sandwiches of peanut butter and sweet pickle relish.'

Emil Frey, a Swiss immigrant who lived in Monroe, New York, is credited with creating the first version of Velveeta, which was a combination of whey leftover from the cheese-making process and cheese.

Velveeta quickly became a hit in the United States and almost as quickly became so popular in Germany that the plant that produced it for the country was unable to meet demand just after its release there in 1937.

Three years after Kraft brought the cheese product to market, the American Medical Association gave Velveeta its seal of approval.

Velveeta now accounts for over $500 million of Kraft's annual sales and is sold worldwide.

Velveeta does not require refrigeration on store shelves, where it can last for years.
