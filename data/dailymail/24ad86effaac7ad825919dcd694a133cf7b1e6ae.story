The number of foreign prisoners is growing and attempts to remove them are often futile, a secret Government report warns.

The Home Office document, marked restricted but leaked ahead of a crunch vote by MPs, reveals there are about 12,000 foreign prisoners in the UK – and another 4,000 who have been freed after serving a sentence but not deported.

Their offences include murder, manslaughter, rape of a minor and kidnap.

The report predicts that numbers of more serious offenders will increase and admits: ‘Some countries are extremely difficult to remove a non-compliant person to... these include Iran, Somalia and Zimbabwe.’

The leak came as rebel Tory MPs will today threaten to back a Commons motion that would make it easier to deport foreign criminals after their sentence.

Dominic Raab, whose move is supported by more than 100 MPs, said the leaked document was ‘a chilling analysis of the growing threat of foreign national criminals’.

He added: ‘Today MPs have a chance to steel our deportation capacity to protect the public. We must take it.’

Mr Raab’s amendment to the Government’s Immigration Bill would require judges to deport foreign criminals jailed for over a year, unless they were at risk of torture or murder on return.

It would effectively overrule the controversial Article 8 protection for family life contained in the European Convention on Human Rights used by some foreigners to avoid deportation.

David Cameron has indicated some sympathy with the idea but Home Secretary Theresa May is said to have vetoed Government support for the change.

Nick Clegg is also said to have raised concerns.

The Home Office report, which appears to date from 2012, says there were 10,779 foreigners serving time in UK prisons, 1,431 who had served time but were still detained pending removal, and 4,238 now ‘non-detained’ because there was ‘no reasonable expectation of removal in the short term’.

It warns that polling data shows that removing foreign prisoners at the end of their sentence is considered ‘one of the key priorities’ for the UK Border Agency by the public.’

‘Individual cases continue to receive high-profile media coverage, more recently focusing on the UK’s inability to deport individuals due to Article 8 of the ECHR,’ it continues.

The report warns that the number of ‘non-detained, time-served’ foreign prisoners has ‘increased due to accumulation of hard to remove cases and longer time spent in the UK’.

It says data from late in 2011 showed that 111 ‘non-detained’ foreigners had committed the most serious offences, including murder, manslaughter, rape, rape of a minor, sex offences against children, indecent assault of a minor or terrorist offences.

A further 485 had committed serious offences including attempted murder, attempted rape, kidnapping, sex offences, violent crime, indecent assault, armed robbery and conspiracy to murder, kidnap or defraud.

‘The absolute numbers of these types of offenders will increase,’ the report adds, suggesting the total number of serious offenders will rise to 646 by April of this year.

Last night, Home Secretary Theresa May attempted to appease the Tory backbenches by promising to strip British terror suspects of their citizenship.

Under the tough new rules, officials would be able to remove a fanatic’s passport even if it leaves them technically stateless. The move would mean that, if the extremist ever left Britain, they would find it near impossible to return.

But the last-minute intervention failed to quell Tory anger over the Home Office’s handling of the flagship Immigration Bill, which returns to the Commons today.

The Home Office has tabled dozens of amendments to the legislation and limited the time available for debate to just four hours - meaning that the rebels’ concerns may not even be discussed.

Mr Raab added: ‘The government is trying the old trick of squeezing awkward amendments off the agenda. It beggars belief that the most popular amendment, with cross-partly support, isn’t guaranteed even a minute of debating time. It risks strengthening the perception that the political elite won’t address the issues ordinary people care about - and that is UKIP’s feeding ground.’

Fellow Tory MP Peter Bone described the Home Office’s handling of the issue as ‘a complete farce’.

He added: ‘It looks very much like the Government is going to use Parliamentary tactics to try and stifle debate on issues that are of huge concern to the public. If ministers get their way we will have no vote and no more than a token debate - it is a gift to UKIP.’

Dozens of Conservative MPs have signed another amendment that would re-impose the restrictions on Bulgarian and Romanian immigrants which lapsed at the beginning of this month. Ministers say the move would be illegal under EU law.

Government sources said Mrs May was planning to come forward with her own proposals for curbing the use of Article 8 in the coming months. ‘There is a lot of sympathy for doing something on this, but it has to be legally watertight,’ a source said.

The Home Secretary already has the power to take away British citizenship from those with dual nationality. To date, she has confiscated the UK passports of 16 individuals alleged to have links with terror groups.

But she now intends to go much further by also removing citizenship from people who gave up their original nationality to become British.

A spokesman for legal charity Reprieve said: ‘This is a very alarming development, which reverses a long-standing ban on citizenship-stripping where doing so would leave someone stateless.

‘It would give the Home Secretary the power to tear up people’s passports without any need for the kind of due process we might once have expected as British citizens.’

A Home Office source said last night that the department ‘doesn’t recognise’ the content of the leaked report and it was ‘not true’ that deportation efforts to some countries were becoming futile.
