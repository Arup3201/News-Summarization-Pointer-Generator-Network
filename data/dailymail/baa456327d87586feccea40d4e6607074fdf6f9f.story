Tottenham left-back Danny Rose has signed a new five-year contract with the club.

Rose, who moved to Tottenham from Leeds in July 2007, has made 59 appearances for the north London outfit.

The 24-year-old enjoyed a successful loan spell at Sunderland during the 2012-13 campaign and was rewarded with an extended run in the Spurs side last season, making 22 league appearances.

Future at Spurs: Danny Rose has signed a long-term five-year-deal at Tottenham

His future at White Hart Lane has been in question since Spurs signed 21-year-old left-back Ben Davies from Swansea last week.

During Tottenham's pre-season tour of America, however, head coach Mauricio Pochettino indicated Davies had been brought in to compete with Rose rather than replace him.

'Ben Davies is important for us because he's good competition for Danny Rose on the left side,' Pochettino told the official club website.

'He's a young player but he has good experience in the Premier League.'

Rose has scored three goals for Tottenham, including a memorable long-range strike against Arsenal on his debut in April 2010.
