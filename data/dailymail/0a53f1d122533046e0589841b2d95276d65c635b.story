The parents of a man who was killed by an anti-gunrunning operation have accused Justice Department officials of 'hiding something'.

The Fast and Furious operation let illicit guns 'walk' in
 the hope of tracking them to bigger traffickers, but many of the guns 
just disappeared into Mexico.

Two of those guns were later found at the 
crime scene where border agent Brian Terry was gunned down by illegal immigrants in December 2010 just north of the Mexican
border.

Terry's parents, Kent and Josephine 
Terry, said they are upset that the Obama administration may be 
preventing them from getting the full story about how their son died.

Speaking to Fox news Kent said: 'They're lying. They're passing the 
buck.

'I just know that they're hiding 
something big. Something happened out there.'

A House panel voted Wednesday along party lines to recommend holding Attorney General Eric Holder in contempt of Congress for not handing over a trove of documents related to Fast and Furious, and Republican leaders are considering a full House vote.

President Obama has asserted executive privilege in keeping many of the documents out of public view.

Holder has not yet been formally held in contempt of Congress. The full House would still need to approve the resolution in order for that to happen.

Rep. Darrell Issa, R-Calif., suggested the vote can be avoided if the attorney general turns over more emails and memos about the Fast and Furious sting.

Holder has testified he only found out about Fast and Furious after Terry's death, and he condemned the tactics. But GOP lawmakers have suggested top officials at the Justice Department knew more about the operation than they have said.

President Obama's decision to assert executive privilege over Operation Fast and Furious documents not only failed to delay contempt proceedings against Attorney General Eric Holder - it raised a whole new line of constitutional questions and challenges about the power of the presidency.
