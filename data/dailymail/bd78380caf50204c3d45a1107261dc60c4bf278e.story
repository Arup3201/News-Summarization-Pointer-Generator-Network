Cabinet Office minister Francis Maude wants older people to use the internet to access government services

Older people must start using the 
internet or run the risk of losing access to government services, a 
senior Tory said yesterday.

The vast majority of public services will only be available online in the future, said Cabinet Office Minister Francis Maude.

He
 said millions of pounds can be saved by copying airlines, which only 
provide services face-to-face if there is no way to move them online.

The
 minister called on older people to get ‘digitally engaged’ – because 
getting to grips with the internet is a ‘better thing for people’s 
lives’.

But pensioners’ 
groups last night reacted with fury, saying that elderly people who 
refused to ‘conform’ to the state’s demands would be treated as 
‘second-class citizens’.

Those
 who had paid taxes all their lives should be able to access government 
services in whichever way they feel most comfortable – and not left to 
‘drown’, they said.

At a 
Treasury conference, Mr Maude said one-off help will be given for the 
‘digitally-excluded’ – chiefly pensioners. He said: ‘Our point is that 
everything that can be delivered online should be delivered online and 
only online.’

More than five million pensioners have never been online, estimates show.

Ministers
 are moving dozens of public services on to the internet, including the 
carers’ allowance, used by the 3.2million carers a year.

Driving
 licences, the small claims service and ‘lasting powers of attorney’ – 
which allow families to take control of a loved one’s financial affairs –
 are also going online.

Mr
 Maude, addressing civil servants about government efficiency measures, 
said such moves would cut the cost of manning phonelines or face-to-face
 services.

Help for 
those who did not know how to use the internet would be given through a 
‘assisted digital’ service, provided by charities such as the 
Alzheimer’s Society.

But
 the focus would be on showing them how to go online – not on helping 
them to access services if they do not wish to use the internet. Mr 
Maude also indicated that help would not be offered ‘repeatedly’.

‘They’re
 doing it in a way that will help to get those people online, because 
actually people will have in future richer lives if they become 
digitally engaged,’ he said.

Pensioner Joan Ibbotson was taught to use the internet on her iPad by a friend at her home in Plympton, Plymouth as part of a project funded by the Daily Mail. But many elderly people have no access to the internet

Pensioners’
 groups yesterday expressed concern that services important to the 
elderly, such as pensions, benefits and council tax, will be moved 
online only.

Dot Gibson, of the National Pensioners’ Convention, said ministers were creating an ‘information gap’.

‘The idea that we all have to be digital citizens or else we end up as second-class citizens is wrong,’ she said.

Lisa
 Harris, from Saga, added: ‘The digital tide is certainly turning, but 
the Government needs to ensure we can all ride the technology wave and 
not leave some left to drown unaided because they don’t choose to 
“conform”.’

Caroline Abrahams, of Age UK, added: ‘No-one should be locked out of any services simply because they don’t use the internet.’

People
 should be able to vote from the comfort of their armchairs, Commons 
Speaker John Bercow said last night. Allowing the electorate to go 
online rather than to polling booths is hardly ‘earth-shattering’, he 
told the Policy Exchange think-tank.
