It may not have the slick design of Apple's Watch - or the extortionate price tag - but Microsoft is hoping its Band fitness tracker and watch will rival the likes of Fitbit as well as the Moto 360.

The Band features sensors that track distance, pulse rate, calories, sleep quality and even UV exposure, and it doubles up as a smartwatch to show notifications. 

It was released in the US last year but was only available in Microsoft Stores in select locations. Now its is available to pre-order in the UK and goes on general sale on 15 April.

The Microsoft Band features sensors that track distance, pulse rate, calories, sleep quality and even UV exposure, and it doubles up as a smartwatch to show notifications. It was released in the US last year in select stores but is now available to pre-order in the UK. It goes on general sale on 15 April

The wrist-worn device has 10 smart sensors inside the band and a colourful touchscreen.

In addition to tracking activity, it also offers guided workouts tailored to  a user's exercise goals and GPS route mapping so users can see where they have run or cycled.

'Microsoft Band makes it easier to reach your fitness goals. You can track your daily physical activity and review your stats with a glance at your wrist,' said the Washington-based company.

'Just like a personal trainer, Microsoft Band guides you to improved wellness by constantly learning about you, your current fitness level, and your future needs.'

It doesn't let users make phone calls from the device, but like other smartwatches such as the Moto 360, they can read texts, emails, social media updates and see other notifications.

But unlike other smartwatches on the market, the Band's battery life lasts more than two days - despite having a coloured screen, vibrations and is monitoring heart rate constantly.

But unlike other smartwatches on the market, the Band's battery life lasts more than two days - despite having a coloured screen, vibrations and is monitoring heart rate constantly. 

And all of these features, stats and notifications can be customised on the Microsoft Health app that isn't tied to Microsoft's Windows Phone and works across Android and iOS as well. 

However, the Cortana personal assistant feature is only available for people using a Windows 8.1 device. 

Through Microsoft Health, all of the data is stored in the cloud and can be given to doctors, physiotherapists or used for other clinical reasons. 

Fitness functions: The band is primarily a fitness band. It features smart sensors that monitor pulse rate, measure calorie burn and track sleep quality.

The device also offers workouts put together by Men's Health of Gold's Gym, for example, and GPS route mapping so users can see where they have ran or cycled.

Smartwatch features: The device doesn't allow people to make calls directly, but does push notifications about calls, texts and emails from a user's smartphone to their Microsoft Band.

It has Microsoft's Cortana personal assistant built-in so people can talk to the device to ask it to take notes or set reminders, for example.

Appearance: The band is made of rubber and features a colour touchscreen. Users can change the background screen's colour and design on the Microsoft Health app. 

App: The Band syncs with Microsoft Health and works with iPhone, Android and Windows Phone handsets. 

It additionally syncs with other health and fitness devices and services such as UP by Jawbone, MapMyFitness and RunKeeper. 

Sensors: It has 10 sensors that monitor everything from heart rate and sleep to UV, prompting wearers to apply sunscreen.

Price: $199 in the US and £169.99 in the UK.

Availability: It is available to pre-order today and goes on general sale on 15 April. 

For example, the sleep tracking function can highlight if someone is suffering from sleep apnoea - a condition that causes interrupted breathing during sleep - by tracking heart rate.  

Microsoft Health additionally syncs with other health and fitness devices and services such as UP by Jawbone, MapMyFitness and RunKeeper. 

Data from these different devices and services, such as steps, calories and heart rate can then be combined, enabling an 'Intelligence Engine' which reveals which exercises were most effective during a workout and suggest a recommended recovery time.

This also shows detailed information about when a person entered the aerobic and anaerobic states during a workout to help people more accurately track their fitness or boost weight loss.

Over time, this data can be combined with a calendar to make the Intelligence Machine smarter and offer suggestions for workouts that fit with a user's schedule.

The Band is available for pre-order from Amazon, Currys PC World and Microsoft Store or via O2 and goes on general sale on 15 April.

There is a plethora of fitness trackers on the market, and an increasing number of smartwatches, but despite this competition Microsoft's Band still manages to stand out. 

It's not the best looking device, and by trying to cram in as many sensors as possible Microsoft appears to have forgotten that it needs to be worn for long periods of time. 

Its stiff rubber band is uncomfortable and bulky and its clasp is not easy to do up one-handed. 

Its green light, which reveals when the heart rate is being tracked, is also too bright - especially during the night, and when wearing it to sleep it ended up bruising my arm. 

However, its features more than make up for this shortcoming. The Band has many of the tools seen on other trackers and smartwatches but does them much better. 

Not only does it track heart rate constantly, which helps give a more accurate representation of calories burnt, respiration and sleep than other devices, it also gives more detailed insights into all of your activity.

For example, during sleep it reveals heart rate on a graph, tells you how long you slept and how much of this was classed as so-called restful sleep. It tracks your sleep efficiency and tells you how many calories were burnt as you were dozing. 

And during exercise this heart rate tracker plots when you entered aerobic or an anaerobic state, tells you how many calories were burnt during each stage and reveals how long you should recover before exercising again.  

The Guided Workout section lets you pick and choose for a list of exercise routines and the band gently vibrates to tell you to move onto the next activity. This is preferable to watching a video or having audio beeps. 

These vibrations are also used to alert a user to Facebook and Twitter notifications, emails and text messages and a Quick Read button will show the text of these notifications word-by-word so you don't have to scroll through on the small screen.

The Band was the first wearable that stopped me reaching for my phone every 10 minutes or so.  

The only criticism of these sensors is that the pedometer, in particular, is a little sensitive and occasionally tracked single steps when driving in a car and hitting a pot hole or going over a speed bump.

Microsoft claims the battery last for two days and during our tests it exceeded this. 

We ran a 5K on day one and walked an hour and 10 minutes on the second day, as well as received countless notifications and alerts and the phone lasted a staggering 53 hours on a single charge. 

This is even more impressive when you consider it is tracking heart rate constantly, and is used overnight during sleep.

But the most impressive feature is the price. 

All of these features cost just £169.99 in the UK and $199 in the US. This is almost half the price of Apple's Watch and $50 cheaper than the Moto 360 in the US and £30 cheaper than the Fitbit Surge in the UK.

It's not perfect, and the price reflects the poor design, but for a first foray into this industry its a decent effort.
