The 16-year-old charged in the fatal stabbing of a high school student appeared in court Friday morning as his victim was laid to rest in a nearby cemetery and was ordered held on a $3million bond.

Christopher Plaskon, was charged with murder in the slaying of Maren Sanchez after authorities say he stabbed her to death last week in a hallway at Jonathan Law High School in Milford, Connecticut, because she turned down his invitation to the prom.

Plaskon showed no visible emotion during the brief hearing in which he wore handcuffs, leg shackles and no shoes as he stood next to his attorneys and his uncle Paul Healy, who was appointed his guardian.

Plaskon was ordered transferred to the state's Manson Youth Institution in Cheshire, where lawyer Richard Meehan asked that he be placed at a hospital under a suicide watch.

He will not enter a plea until after a probable cause hearing, which is scheduled for June 4.

Meehan did not provide details of Plaskon's condition, but he did say the boy understands he's charged with murder and that Meehan is his attorney.

It was further disclosed by officials that Plaskon is showing signs of psychosis.

The attack occurred last Friday just hours before the school's junior prom, and police believe it is likely because Sanchez refused to be Plaskon's prom date.

Meehan said Plaskon's parents wanted to attend the hearing, but he recommended against it because he believed it would be too difficult. He said they are in seclusion.

'All their hearts are broken,' Meehan said, referring to Plaskon's family. 'I think the word numb is probably the best word I could use to describe what these people are going through.'

Plaskon was arraigned Tuesday at a medical facility, where his attorneys have said he has been undergoing psychiatric evaluation.

State's Attorney Kevin Lawlor decided Plaskon will be prosecuted as an adult, and not in juvenile court.

A witness saw Plaskon on top of the 16-year-old victim during the attack, and tried unsuccessfully to pull him away, and another saw him discard a bloody knife, according to a police affidavit.

Plaskon was taken to the principal's office drenched in blood and asked by an officer what happened.

'I did it. Just arrest me,' Plaskon replied, according to the officer.

The hearing occurred one day after a wake held for the teen victim, and on the same day as her funeral.

The killing rocked the small coastal town perched on the Long Island Sound about 70 miles northeast Manhattan.

Friends wore purple, Sanchez's favorite color, and locals lined up for hours to attend her wake.
