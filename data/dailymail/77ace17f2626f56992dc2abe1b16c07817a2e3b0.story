Squatters refusing to leave a Palm Springs apartment at the centre of an Airbnb 'horror story' have complained THEY are the ones being harassed.

Hiding his face with a hoodie and scarf, a man who claimed to be the brother of squatter Maksym Pashanin answered the door of the home in a gated community in Palm Springs.

Videogame programmer Maksym is currently locked in a legal battle with Airbnb host Cory Tschogl, 39, who initially agreed to rent him her property for 44 days from May 25 to July 8. But now he refuses to leave.

Hooded: A man claiming to be the brother of Airbnb renter Maksym Pashanin answers the door to San Bernadino County process server Sean Dacy - who left without handing over the eviction notice

'Horror story': Pashanin is locked in the legal battle that could last for months and cost $5,000 because under California law he cannot just be kicked out for not paying his rent or overstaying his welcome

What Cory didn't realise is that under Californian law once someone has rented a property for more than 30 days they are treated as a tenant on a month-by-month lease.

To get him out she now has to go through a legal process that could take between three and six months and cost between $3,000 and $5,000. In that time Maksym and his brother can continue to live rent-free.

And the brothers don't seem to be giving up easily. San Bernadino County process server Sean Dacy arrived yesterday to serve Maksym with an eviction notice.

Dacy couldn't serve the papers because he has to hand them to Maksym personally but the man answering the door claimed to be his brother.

Instead, the man complained to Dacy: 'I can’t [take the scarf off] because these guys [the press] have been harassing me all day. I can’t even get to MY secure mailbox.'

Dacy wasn't convinced. 'If he’s covering his face, that's probably him,’ he said as he walked away.

After paying his initial 30 days rent, Maksym has not made any further payments, and ignored repeated requests to vacate the property by both Airbnb and Cory.

Shortly after moving into the home, located on the Western side of the upmarket desert community, Maksym told Cory his brother had fallen ill from drinking the tap water and was now suffering a stomach ulcer. He demanded a refund.

Cory, who lives in San Francisco and works as a therapist for blind people, was also met with an angry response when she threatened to cut off the utilities.

Maksym texted her: 'Hi Cory, this is Maksym. I have consulted my attorney. As I said multiple times I am LEGALLY occupying the domicile. My nature of work from home is dependent on electricity, and my income while working averages $1,000 to $7,000 per day, involving over 2000 customers in the US alone. IF THE ELECTRICITY GETS CUT OFF I WILL BE LOSING MONEY EVERY DAY.

'I am pressing charges for blackmail and damages caused by your negligence and misconduct, including $3,800 PID Espresso machine as well as medical bills for my brother’s hospital visit after he got sick here drinking unfiltered tap water (ulcer).

'Not only what you do is illegal, it is also discriminatory in nature and had (sic) cause me and my brother a lot of stress and suffering.'

Cory told the San Francisco Chronicle that the episode has been a 'horror story'.

She bought the one-bedroom condo 18 months ago and she charged around $450 a week to renters.

Squatter: Maksym Pashanin (seen here promoting his videogame) first complained to Cory that his brother had fallen ill from the water. Then when she threatened to turn off the utilities he said he had contacted a lawyer

When it became clear that Maksym was turning into a nightmare tenant Cory complained to Airbnb, but was angry at the response from the company.

'They were almost absent,' she said. 'There was no phone number or direct contact e-mail. I got e-mail responses only every 24 to 48 hours.'

Airbnb eventually paid her the two weeks' missing rent and offered to pay for Maksym, who had a 'verified ID' with Airbnb saying he is from Austin, Texas, to stay at a hotel for 30 days. But he never answered emails and his phone was disconnected.

Airbnb has since apologised and spokesman Nick Papas said: 
'Officials from our team have contacted this host and she has been paid 
the full cost of the reservation and we're working with her to provide 
additional legal support as we move forward.

'We're
 also reviewing our procedures and making changes to our platform to 
give hosts more information about long-term reservations.'

Maksym was identified by KESQ.COM as a videogame programmer who created a computer game called Confederate Express.

Maksym used kickstarter to raise $40,000 to fund the game but after eight months he has delivered nothing beyond a demo. KESQ said Maksym has claimed that the game will be released, but has said he has made some bad business decisions.

The case echoes that of 'nightmare nanny' Diane Stretton, who moved in to work for Marcella Bracamonte and her family in Upland, California, earlier this year but quickly gave up all duties, and refused to leave despite being fired.

Apology: Airbnb came under fire from the condo's
 owner Cory Tschogl for not helping her quickly enough at first. The 
firm has now apologised, paid her rent she was due and offered to help 
with the legal fees involved

Mrs Bracamonte, 31, and her husband, Ralph, hired Stretton on March 4 using Craigslist to help with their three children, ages 11, four and one, but Stretton quickly stopped doing any work, claiming she had chronic obstructive pulmonary disease.

She also reportedly threatened to sue the family for wrongful dismissal and abuse of the elderly.

Although the police were contacted they said there was nothing they could do, as it was a civil matter.

After negotiations with the family she was thought to have left at the beginning of July.

Attorney Robert Spitz told ABC News that the landlord tenant law in California is very specific in terms of eviction processes. 'If the guy's a deadbeat, what does he care? He paid one month and he gets three months,' Spitz added.
