A devastated family is pleading with thieves to return a stolen video camera containing the only videos they own of their daughter who died at six days old.

Zachary and Dawn Whirley's house in Wembley, Perth, was broken into one week ago and the thieves took Mr Whirley's car keys, car, wallet and video camera containing the precious home movies.

A cyclist found his wallet dumped on the ground and police found his car two days later but Mr Whirley, 41, hasn't got back the one thing he really wants – the memory card that holds all the videos the family owns of their daughter Ella.

Mr Whirley, who lives in Perth, is pleading with thieves to return a stolen camera containing videos of Ella so his other two children Andy, 4, and Rose, 2, understand they had an older sibling

'We're starting to get more pessimistic about the chances of recovering it,' Mr Whirley told Daily Mail Australia.

'My wife has been very upset, she cries a lot at night and I can't do a lot to console her.

'It's sort of the dredging it all up again, reliving the whole scenario and the death all over again.'

Ella died in 2009, six days after she was born due to a heart defect.

Mr Whirley says he doesn't want the camera back he just wants the videos so his other two children Andy, 4, and Rose, 2, understand they had an older sibling.

Ella died in 2009, six days after she was born due to a heart defect, when the family lived in Houston, Texas

'I'm happy to give the camera to them I just want the movies back no questions asked, no hard feelings,' he said.

'We want Andy and Rose to know that Ella was here before they were and they had another sibling.

'We want them to see they have a sister no longer here.'

The camera also holds videos of other important milestones like Andy and Rose's birthdays, Rose's first steps and family holidays.

Mr Whirley added that he had been meaning to upload the videos onto his computer but 'life got in the way'.

'Some people have said "Who in the world leaves videos on a camera for five years?"

'But since we took videos we have moved [from the U.S.] to Australia, we've had two kids... I just assumed it would be around forever.'

The family, originally from Louisiana, lived in Houston, Texas when Ella was born.

The moved from Houston to Perth because Mrs Whirley, 39, who is a petroleum engineer, was offered a transfer within her company.

Mr Whirley said the videos contain footage of their family members who travelled from all over the U.S. to visit Ella and spend the precious few days they could with her.
