These days we have Instagram filters and Facebook check-ins to induce  envy in our friends. But before social media came along, the postcard was the ultimate holiday brag. 

To celebrate World Post Day on October 9, here is one of the world's largest postcard collections.

Swiss entrepreneur Adolf Feller began collecting the souvenirs in 1899 during his travels for his electrical goods business.

The collection contains more than 54,000 monochrome and colour photographs from 140 countries, including New Zealand, Japan, Uganda, and from cities and towns around Switzerland.

Friends and family  contributed to the collection, which Feller left to his daughter Elizabeth after his death in 1931.

Some of the postcards were collated in a book published in 2011, 'The World in Pocket-Size Format: The Adolf Feller Postcard Collection,' by Monika Burri. 

The tradition of sending postcards to loved ones back home is steadily declining. Fewer than one billion are now sent each year, compared with more than 4.5 billion in 1951.
