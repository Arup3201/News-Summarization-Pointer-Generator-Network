Fears Spain's government may need a massive bailout on top the €100billion handed to its financial sector were heightened today as the cost of public borrowing soared to almost crisis levels.

The interest rate on Spanish 10-year 
bonds rose to 6.6 per cent - near to the 7 per cent level that forced Greece, Ireland and Portugal to request the rescue of their 
public finances.

Adding extra pressure on Spain was Fitch's decision to downgrade the debt rating of 18 domestic banks due to their exposure to Spanish government debt.

Last night the £80billion bailout for Spanish banks was branded a 'sticking plaster' and the euro tumbled

Now, following the European rescue of
Spain's banks, there are fears that its financial sector may still fail
and its own government will have to step in and pump in more cash.

This could prompt an EU bailout of 
the entire nation, especially interest rates reach the critical 7 per 
cent point that would make it difficult for Spain to raise enough cash 
on international money markets.

Yet, despite scepticism over Europe's move to rescue the Spanish banking sector, markets across the globe made tentative gains today.

Wall
Street's Dow Jones Industrial Average rose just 0.3 per cent, the 
FTSE-100 pared earlier gains to stand 0.2 per cent down, as did the Dax 
and CAC 40 in Frankfurt and Paris.

Plans
for a potential €100 billion bailout for Spain's banks were initially 
warmly received before euphoria faded and the gravity of the eurozone 
crisis set in.

Warning: Austrian finance minister Maria Fekter (left) has said Italy, led by Mario Monti (right), may soon have to be financially saved by the eurozone

It has seen borrowing costs in Spain and Italy continuing their recent ascent.

The bank rescue package in Spain was 
announced on Saturday but is already being seen as little more than a 
sticking plaster for the eurozone's troubles.

Jeremy Batstone-Carr, analyst at 
Charles Stanley, said: 'Despite the increasingly pressing need to 
resolve the growing Spanish banking crisis, a very real possibility 
exists that a workable solution may not be forthcoming, leaving Spanish 
banks to fail with significant adverse implications.'

Banks were under pressure with Barclays off 2.8p to 187.8p and Royal Bank of Scotland slipping 2p at 219.4p.

Lloyds Banking Group, however, was up
0.2p at 28.7p, but this was only after the sale of its remittance 
business in Japan to Shinsei Bank.

Stock markets across Europe rose this morning but in Asia there were drops following Wall Street losses

The fears that the banks bailout is
already failing came as Austria's finance minister today said Italy, 
the eurozone's third largest economy, may also imminently need a 
financial rescue because of its high borrowing costs.

Maria
Fekter's comments, which rose the stakes in Europe's debt crisis even 
further, amplified investors' fears that Europe's leaders are far from 
ending almost three years of turmoil.

She said: 'Italy has to work its way 
out of its economic dilemma of very high deficits and debt, but of 
course it may be that - given high rates Italy pays to refinance markets
- they too will need support.'

The market reaction suggests that 
ministers have failed to break the so-called doom loop between rising 
government debt, economic recession and teetering banks that previously 
drove Greece, Ireland and Portugal into EU/IMF bailouts.            

Analysts cited uncertainty about the 
mechanics of the Spanish rescue package and fears that private 
bondholders could be subordinated to official lenders, risking losses in
any debt restructuring, as they suffered in Greece.

'Is this the next stage of a slippery slope in subordinating existing government bondholders?' asked Deutsche Bank strategist Jim Reid in a note to clients.     

Investors are also worrying about the outcome of a Greek general election next Sunday which may determine whether the country stays in the eurozone.             

European Commission President Jose Manuel Barroso, European Central Bank policymaker Christian Noyer and French Finance Minister Pierre Moscovici also all called today for swift moves to create a eurozone banking union.                

Barroso told the Financial Times that a cross-border banking supervisor, a deposit guarantee scheme and a bank resolution fund could be put in place in 2013 without changing EU treaties. EU paymaster Germany has so far rejected a deposit guarantee or a resolution fund, saying they would require treaty change.             

Britain, which is home to the eurozone's biggest financial centre but is not in the single currency and opposes closer EU integration, should be allowed to opt out of such a union if it agreed not to block it, he said.      

Fekter's typically outspoken comments came after Italy's industry minister dismissed the idea that Rome may need external help, saying reforms adopted by his government so far had put the Italian economy on a sound footing.                

Her concerns are shared by one of the German government's council of economic advisers, Lars Feld, who said that Italy could be next in line.   

'Overcoming the troubles in Spain will bring calm to the markets for a while, but the chances are not so small that Italy may also come under fire, in particular as the promised labour market reform has turned out to be less ambitious,' Feld said.             

The Austrian minister has a track record of speaking out of turn or undiplomatically. She angered EU paymaster Germany last month by suggesting Greece might be forced out of the European Union over its economic problems.                

She infuriated Eurogroup chairman Jean-Claude Juncker in March by rushing out to brief the media on a deal to increase the eurozone's financial firewall before he could make the official announcement, forcing her to apologise.               

And when U.S. Treasury Secretary Timothy Geithner was invited to a eurozone finance ministers' meeting in Poland last year to plead for a more robust rescue fund, Fekter said bluntly that Washington should look after its own worse fiscal mess first.

In Brussels, EU officials privately voiced exasperation at her latest comments on Italy.            

A eurozone official said: 'The problem is that this is market sensitive. It's one thing if journalists write this but quite another if a eurozone minister says it. Verbal discipline is very important but she doesn't seem to get that.'

Italy's leading economic newspaper, Il Sole 24, appealed to Germany today to act to save the single currency before it is too late.     

'Schnell Frau Merkel! (Hurry Up Mrs Merkel!),' the usually sober business daily said in a banner headline in German.     

An editorial urged Chancellor Angela Merkel 'to make three choices quickly to save the euro and build a politically united Europe'.

She should back guarantees for European bank deposits, allow direct access for banks to euro zone rescue funds and accept a mutualisation of European public debts, with each country paying a different interest rates.

Italy has the eurozone's second highest debt-to-GDP ratio after Greece.  

Merkel has opposed issuing joint euro zone bonds and says euro zone member states must agree to transfer more budget sovereignty to European institutions, including the EU's Court of Justice, as part of a political union before she would consider such idea.
