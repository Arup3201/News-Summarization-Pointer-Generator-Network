Steven Gerrard's farewell season at Liverpool still has more than three months to run, but his wife Alex is already thinking about extending the couple's stay in Los Angeles when they move this summer.

Liverpool captain Gerrard links up with MLS side LA Galaxy when his current contract expires this summer but his other half is already scouting for houses on the other side of the Atlantic in preparation for the move.

And 32-year-old model Alex already fancies more than an 18-month spell in LA despite her husband having only seen the city that will become their home over video chats.

Gerrard could be spending more than the initially planned 18 months in LA, if his wife gets her way

'I love it here,' Alex told the Sunday Mirror. 'He has an 18-month deal but I hope he gets it extended because it's great here.

'I'd love to stay here longer. It's so different to Liverpool but I think we'll be really happy.'

Gerrard's Liverpool commitments have made it difficult to visit LA but he has been getting in the mood for the move to Tinsel Town with the help of video chats with his wife ahead of moving out of Liverpool for the first time on June 27.

'The houses are so beautiful. I wish I could find one I didn't like!'
