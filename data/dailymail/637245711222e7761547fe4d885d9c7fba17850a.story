David Cameron and William Hague will respond to intense pressure from mutinous Tory Eurosceptics today by unveiling an EU referendum Bill.

The Prime Minister and the Foreign Secretary will back draft legislation which, if passed in the Commons, would formally confirm Mr Cameron’s pledge to hold an ‘in/out’ vote on Britain’s membership of the EU by 2017.

The extraordinary move emerged as around 60 Tory rebels prepare to attack the Queen’s Speech for its lack of a referendum Bill in an amendment tomorrow that has turned into a public relations disaster for the Prime Minister.

Speaking at a press conference US President Barack Obama offered a well-timed rebuff to Tory rebels calling for an early referendum on leaving the EU

In the past few days, a string of 
senior colleagues, including two Cabinet ministers, have fanned the 
flames by suggesting they would want Britain to quit the EU if a 
referendum were held now.

However Mr Cameron was thrown a 
lifeline last night when President Barack Obama backed his plan to try 
to ‘fix what’s broken’ before holding a referendum.

The legislation to be unveiled today 
will probably end up being put forward as a Private Member’s Bill but is
 unlikely to become law because it would require a substantial amount of
 Parliamentary time and Liberal Democrat co-operation.

It has been drafted by Conservative Central Office, rather than the Foreign Office, because it is not a Government Bill.

However a senior source confirmed the 
Prime Minister would vote in favour of the legislation if it is brought 
forward by a backbench MP. Mr Cameron’s aides hope the move will help 
convince the public – and his party – that he is committed to holding a 
referendum if he wins the next election.

Socially the two leaders get on well, apparently discussing cricket and basketball outside their political duties at the press conference

Mr Cameron also used the meeting to launch a EU-US free trade deal ahead of next month's G8 summit

UKIP has doubled its support in a single month at the expense of the three main parties – reaching a record 18 per cent, a poll revealed last night.

The Eurosceptic party has surged from 9 per cent as its leader Nigel Farage claimed the Tories and Labour were considering fielding joint candidates with him. 

Labour, the Conservatives and Liberal Democrats have all lost four points each, taking them to 34 per cent, 28 per cent and 11 per cent respectively, according to the Guardian survey.

It is unprecedented for all the main parties to fall at the same time. Mr Farage’s approval ratings have also soared to 40 per cent in his favour, with 23 per cent against – a net positive of 17. David Cameron hit a new personal low of minus 15.

They also hope it will force Labour leader Ed Miliband either to back it or be seen to be denying the public a vote.

Downing Street was delighted by 
President Obama’s support for Mr Cameron’s attempt to keep Britain in 
the EU by negotiating a better deal with Brussels.

At a joint press conference in the 
White House, Mr Obama said: ‘David’s basic point, that you probably want
 to see if you can fix what’s broken in a very important relationship 
before you break it off, makes some sense to me. I know that David’s 
been very active in seeking some reforms internal to the EU. Those are 
tough negotiations. You got a lot of countries involved. I recognise 
that.

‘But so long as we haven’t yet 
evaluated how successful those reforms will be, you know, I, at least, 
would be interested in seeing whether or not those are successful before
 rendering a final judgment.’

His remarks represent a marked shift 
in the attitude of the Obama administration, which had previously warned
 the UK not to flirt with the idea of leaving the EU. However, he made 
it clear that, in US eyes, Britain’s place in the world would be 
diminished if it quit.

Mr Cameron, speaking hours after 
Education Secretary Michael Gove and Defence Secretary Philip Hammond 
revealed they would vote to leave the EU if a referendum were held now, 
insisted there was no point answering ‘hypothetical’ questions about a 
vote that will not be until 2017.

He refused to say how he would vote if
 a referendum were held now and made clear his irritation with ministers
 who are fuelling the debate on Europe.

‘What matters now is making sure we do
 everything we can to reform the EU to make it more flexible, more open,
 more competitive, and improve Britain’s relations so that when we have 
that referendum before the end of 2017 we give the British people a real
 choice,’ he said.

Should David Cameron bring forward the EU referendum?

He hit back at Tory grandees, such as 
former Chancellors Lord Lawson and Lord Lamont and former leadership 
contender Michael Portillo, who warned last week that there was little 
chance of securing enough meaningful concessions from Brussels.

‘We should not give up before the 
negotiations have started. That is a pretty extraordinary way to go 
about things,’ Mr Cameron said.

The Prime Minister insisted it would 
not be in Britain’s ‘national interest’ to hold a referendum now, as 
some Tories are demanding.

An immediate poll would offer the 
public ‘a false choice between the status quo, which I don’t think is 
acceptable, and leaving’, he said.

‘I don’t think that is the choice the 
British public wants or the British public deserve. Everything I do in 
this area is guided by a very simple principle, which is, what is in the
 national interest of Britain.’

David Cameron is in Washington for talks with US President Barack Obama, but the trip has been overshadowed by questions over Tory splits back home over Europe

Mr Cameron was forced to slap down Tory ministers calling to leave the EU, ahead of talks with President Obama on tackling global tax avoidance and ending the conflict in Syria

Britain is to send another £10million in military aid to Syrian rebels, David Cameron announced yesterday amid ‘growing evidence’ the rogue regime is using chemical weapons against its own people.

The Prime Minister said Britain would be stepping up military aid to rebel fighters, despite warnings the equipment could fall into the hands of Al Qaeda terrorists who have flooded into the country to help topple dictator Bashar al-Assad.

Mr Cameron said Britain could not stand on the sidelines as thousands of Syrians were slaughtered, adding: ‘Syria’s history is being written in the blood of its people and it is happening on our watch.’ 

The £10million, which represents a doubling of military aid this year, will be spent on non-lethal equipment such as body armour and radios.

Eurosceptic MP Andrew Rosindell 
insisted Mr Cameron would not be able to refashion Britain’s 
relationship with Brussels to a sufficient extent. He said: ‘I think 
David Cameron has huge abilities and he is bound to secure some 
concessions but will he secure the ending of political union for 
Britain? I don’t think so. I’m not convinced that’s possible.

‘I do believe David Cameron is sincere
 in wanting this referendum. I think that the people of this country 
must understand that the only hope of getting out of this mess of Europe
 is a Conservative government with a majority.’

Bridgwater and West Somerset MP Ian 
Liddell-Grainger said Britain should ‘come out’ of the EU, adding: ‘I’m 
sick to death with it. It’s bankrupt. It’s pushing us to do things we 
don’t want to do. It’s a dictatorship from Brussels.’

Sheila Gunn, press secretary to John 
Major when his premiership was dogged by Tory divisions over Europe, 
warned there were ‘some parallels’.

‘Is now really the right time to make a
 fuss of it?’ she said. ‘You could... say now that the Conservative 
Party is handing the election to the Labour Party.’

Lib Dem Business Secretary Vince Cable
 said the Tories had ‘a bee in their bonnets and an obsession on Europe’
 adding: ‘There’s no reason we should have a debate now, the focus 
should be on the economy.’
