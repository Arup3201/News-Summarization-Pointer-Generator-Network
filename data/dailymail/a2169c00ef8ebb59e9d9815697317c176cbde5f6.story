Graham Richardson, 27, was sentenced to life behind bars after murdering antiques dealer Peter Battle and leaving his body to rot for weeks

A killer who murdered an antiques dealer and left his corpse to rot for weeks as he repeatedly stole more goods has been jailed for life. 

Graham Richardson was sentenced to a minimum of 27 years in prison today after being found guilty of murder following a five week trial.

Richardson clubbed Peter Battle to death with a heavy ornament and then hid his body at his cottage in Full Sutton, East Yorkshire.

The alleged heroin-user returned to the property to repeatedly steal goods that he then passed on to elderly friends and relatives.

A court heard he covered up the killing with ‘cunning and guile’ by posting fake notes on Mr Battle’s window and covering his body and a window so it couldn’t be seen.

The murder is said to have taken place on December 30 last year and Mr Battle lay undiscovered at his home until early February.

His body was eventually found when neighbours started to get concerned and called police, who broke in and found his body.

Passing sentence today Mr Justice Stephen Males said Richardson had launched a 'vicious and sustained attack' on a 'defenceless and unconscious man' who he had already stabbed to the ground.

A pathologist report found the victim suffered some 40 injuries, including fatal blows to the head.

'You demonstrated extreme callousness by leaving his body to lie for five weeks before it was found,' added the judge.

'The
 ransacking of a dead man's home with his body lying there is despicable
 conduct, made worse by the way in which it was repeated over an 
extended period.'

Victim: Antiques dealer Peter Battle was was found murdered in his countryside home in Full Sutton, East Yorkshire

The victim's daughter, Lisa Battle,  is one of the first people in the country to be able to address the court under the new Victims’ Code.

The code, which came into effect this month, allows victims or their relatives to address offenders to explain how a crime has impacted them.

Previously, judges read such statements in private.

Looking directly at her father's murderer she said: 'If all you wanted to do was to rob my dad, why didn’t you wait until he was out and then break in when he wasn’t there? 

'You have totally ripped my heart out and that piece that you have ripped out will never grow back.

'How would you feel if someone had done this to your mum in the same way you he done this to my dad and taken advantage as much as they could, like you have done.'

Mr Justice Males praised the woman for her bravery, and that of her family.

'Their courage, love for their father and genuine feelings contrast starkly with your cowardice, selfishness and lies,' he told Richardson.

Richardson had earlier admitted taking and selling jewellery from the cottage but denied murder.

During the five-week trial, prosecutor Nicholas Lumley QC said Richardson killed Mr Battle in rage when he refused to give him credit on gold to sell.

He told Teesside Crown Court that Richardson, of Norton, North Yorkshire, was on bail and desperate for money and went through his ‘little black book’ looking for easy prey.

On December 29 he went to Mr, Battle’s house hoping to get gold and rings on credit so he could sell them and when that didn’t succeed he returned the following day.

Mr Battle again refused and Richardson lost his temper and battered him with a heavy ornament, fracturing his skull, claimed the prosecutor.

Police believe Mr Battle, 56, may have lain dead in the lounge of his home for weeks before his body was found

Scientists allegedly found Richardson’s DNA on Mr Battle’s trouser hem, which the prosecution claimed showed he moved the body after death.

His DNA was also found on a curtain allegedly used to cover a window and door to prevent people from seeing into the house.

The prosecution claimed that Mr Battle’s blood was found in Richardson’s mother’s car which he used and tried to scrap after the death.

The prosecutor said Richardson was expected to claim that Mr Battle had been killed by another man and he had just ‘chanced on a treasure trove’.

Darren Archer, 43, was convicted in court after carrying out a robbery of a gold dealer with Richardson three weeks before the murder took place.

He will be sentenced next month.

Peter Anthony Egan, 48, was acquitted of the same charge.

Richardson showed no emotion as he was jailed for life with concurrent sentences of nine years and one year for robbing Mr Cleaver and stealing Mr Battle's property respectively.

Speaking at Friday's sentencing, Detective Chief Inspector Alistair McFarlane from the Humberside Police Major Incident Team, said: 'Graham Richardson used the house as his own treasure store and returned time and time again to plunder the belongings of the murdered owner. 

'All the time, the decaying body of Mr Battle was lying on the living room floor.'
