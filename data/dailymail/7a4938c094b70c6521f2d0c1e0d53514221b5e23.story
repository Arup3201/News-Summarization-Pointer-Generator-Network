At least three tornadoes touched down in Southwestern Illinois on Tuesday evening with reports of golf ball-sized hail and strong winds ravaging several communities.

At least two semis were reported toppled from strong winds on I-64 near Okawville, hospitalizing two, with several roofs, buildings and at least three homes also damaged throughout Washington County, KSDK reports.

The trucker in one overturned rig was slightly injured, Okawville Police Chief Steve Millikin said, with two taken to Washington County, Illinois hospital. Any additional injuries from the storm have not been reported.

Touching down: At least three tornadoes touched down in Southern Illinois on Tuesday evening while five or six funnel clouds were additionally spotted

Strength: A funnel cloud is captured from a highway, one of several spotted whose strong winds in all would tear off roofs and turn over at least two semis

Building: Tornado warnings were in effect in Eastern Washington County until 6.15pm and Jefferson County until 6.45pm as the residents braced for the worst

Bracing: Residential homes are pictured awaiting the storm that would rip steal beams from farm roofs and level at least one house under construction

Toppled: At least two semi trucks toppled from the strong winds, sending two to the hospital including one driver who was slightly injured

The National Weather Service confirmed three of the tornadoes while five or six additional funnel clouds were spotted but never touched ground.

Chief Millikin says the tornado he videotaped on his dashboard camera clipped the northern edge of his 1,400-resident village on Tuesday night about where the storm leveled a house under construction.

With in some cases golf ball-size hail reported by residents, KTVI captured one woman's back window of her car shattered by hail while driving down Interstate 64 in Okawville.

Of the three tornadoes KSDK reports one touching down near Damiansville while moving east at approximately 25 MPH.

Shattered: A woman's back windshield is pictured after she said large hail caused it to shatter while driving along an interstate

Hail: Most of largest sized hail reported by residents was the size of a golf ball while others got as large as a tennis ball, pictured

Comparisons: Residents were quick to post photos of the hail sizes found in their communities that accompanied 4 to 6 inches of rain

Freshly fallen: A resident photographed this chunk of ice, fresh from the sky while compared in size to some citrus produce

A second was confirmed near Addieville sending fire fighters in a frenzy over reports of fires and a gas leak.

'We've had some damage out on 177 from some barns ... had a gas leak out there as well that's been terminated as well. At this point, responding to a transformer fire also this point so, a lot of debris,' Addieville Fire Chief Ryan Wiewilt told KTVI.

The intensity, path and length of all three twisters have yet to be determined though Eastern Washington County was under a tornado warning until 6.15pm and Jefferson County until 6.45pm.

Spreading: Dark clouds are seen spreading near some roadways with one twister reported moving approximately 25MPH

Taking over: Residents are seen driving before the storm's heavy wall as it begins to encompass the town's sky

Threats: In addition to strong winds, hail and lightning, a gas leak as well as a transformer fire also kept firefighters busy in Addieville

The weather service says parts of southern Illinois also received 4 to 6 inches of rain since Tuesday night.

Approximately 40 miles west of Okawville, however, flooding  was reported closing westbound lanes of Forest Park Parkway in St Louis, Missouri well into early Wednesday morning.

Two elementary schools were also closed today in the St Louis area due to power outages that knocked out power to thousands of Ameren customers.

Residents are being told their power will be returned by mid-day.
