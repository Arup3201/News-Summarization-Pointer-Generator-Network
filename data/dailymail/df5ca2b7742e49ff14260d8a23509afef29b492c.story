The photographs taken by a British explorer that ignited worldwide debate over the existence of the Yeti in the Himalayas are to be auctioned.

During the 1951 Everest expedition, Eric Earle Shipton CBE used an ice pick to give the footprints in the snow at the Memluk Basin some scale. The footprints measure between 12 and 13 inches long.

The photographs came more than 25 years after photographer and member of the Royal Geographic Society N.A. Tombazi claimed to have made the first European sighting of the mythical beast.

He wrote: 'Unquestionably, the figure in outline was exactly like a human being, walking upright and stopping occasionally to pull at some dwarf rhododendron bushes.

'It showed up dark against the snow, and as far as I could make out, wore no clothes.'

Mr Shipton's photographs are part of Christie's ‘Out of the Ordinary: The Online Edit’ auction which will run until September 10. They are being sold for between £2 and £3,000.

Since the photographs were taken critics, paranormal investigators and academics have scrutinised and debated their authenticity.

Some claim Mr Shipton’s photographs offer the best evidence yet of the Yeti’s existence, while others suggest the footprints belong to a known creature and were elongated by melting snow.

There was a further potential encounter with the Yeti by Sir Edmund Hilary, the first man to scale Mount Everest, in 1952 on a pass between the Ngojumba and Khumbu glaciers.

In his book, Hillary, High Adventure, Sir Edmund wrote that his group were climbing a steep pitch when one of the party found a 'tuft of long black hairs'.

Sir Edmund said it was 'thick and coarse' and looked more like 'bristles than anything else'.

Sir Edmund Hillary, pictured here with his sherpa Tenzing Norgay, once wrote of finding what some in his expedition group thought was a tuft of Yeti hair, and later returned to Everest to find further proof

The men who made the discovery, were certain of what it was, calling out  'Yeti, Sahib! Yeti!'.

Sir Edmund wrote: 'I couldn’t help being impressed by their conviction, and it did seem a strange place to find some hair.

'We were well over 19,000 feet and the Abominable Snowman was obviously no mean rock climber.'

In 1960 Sir Edmund mounted an expedition to collect and evaluate evidence of the Yeti's existence, but it proved inconclusive.

Last year, British climber Mike Rees, 73, took a photograph of a footprint in the Himalayas and Yeti experts believe it offered further proof of the creature’s existence.

This is the second time Mr Shipton's photographs have been offered for sale. They sold at auction in London in 2007 for £3,500.
