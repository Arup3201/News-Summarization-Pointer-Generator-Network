Premier League stars from the past, present and future helped Belgium secure a resounding 6-0 victory over lowly Andorra in their Euro 2016 qualifier in Brussels. 

In their first competitive encounter since their World Cup quarter-final loss to Argentina, Belgium struck the woodwork three times in 20 minutes, opened the scoring with a  penalty from former Chelsea midfielder Kevin de Bruyne on the half-hour mark and then ripped apart Andorra's defence.

Tottenham forward Nacer Chadli  doubled the lead with a half-volley and a fine lay-off from Divock Origi, who will play for Liverpool next season, for De Bruyne's second made it 3-0 at halftime.

Origi turned one defender and beat another for number four, before Dries Mertens bagged two, a header after a superb long ball from Radja Nainggolan and a shimmy and sharp shot to make it six.

Before a sell-out crowd in Brussels, the hosts rested Eden Hazard in the hope that his bruised toe would be fully recovered in time for Monday's tougher qualifier against Bosnia.

They did, however, field Chelsea goalkeeper Thibaut Courtois just five days after he suffered a head injury in a collision with Arsenal's Alexis Sanchez in the Premier League, although he barely had a touch.

Belgium were to have opened their qualifying campaign with a trip to Israel, but the match scheduled in September was postponed due to the Gaza conflict.

The visitors, ranked 203rd in FIFA's ranking of 208 nations, won one match and drew two in qualifying for the 2006 World Cup, but have lost every competitive match since, although were only narrowly beaten by Wales last month.

Cyprus and Israel are the other teams in group B.

Israel also had a successful start, beating Cyprus in Nicosia 2-1. Wales took the group lead by one point over Cyprus, Israel and Belgium after holding Bosnia-Herzegovina to a 0-0 draw in Cardiff in their second game.

But with its constant pressure and free-flowing moves, Belgium showed they will be the team to beat in the group.

'That was fun. A beautiful victory,' said De Bruyne after Belgium scored as many goals in one game as during the whole World Cup.

'It was a packed house, so we had better perform,' he added.

The easy victory came without playmaker Eden Hazard, who was protectively kept on the bench with a stubbed toe. Another Chelsea star, goalkeeper Thibaut Courtois, was on the pitch for the whole game despite suffering a head injury in a collision against Arsenal last weekend. He did not have to make a save.
