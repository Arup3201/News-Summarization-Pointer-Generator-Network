The brazen attack on Karachi's Jinnah International Airport late on Sunday left at least 29 people dead, including 10 terrorists, exposing how Pakistan is vulnerable to the militants it nurtured for years in its backyard.

"Ten terrorists infiltrated the old Karachi airport on Sunday night disguised as security guards. Pakistan Army soldiers killed all of them following an operation," a Pakistani official said on Monday.

The attack began just before midnight, when 10 gunmen wearing Airport Security Force uniforms and armed with automatic rifles and rocket-propelled grenades shot their way into the airport's old terminal, which is used mainly for charter and executive flights.

Passengers were evacuated and flights were diverted. Gun battles raged through the night until security forces regained control of the airport in the morning.

The assault has destroyed the prospect of peace talks between the Pakistani Taliban and the government of Prime Minister Nawaz Sharif.

It also deals a heavy blow to Sharif's efforts to attract foreign investors to revive growth, and raises questions about security at the country's main installations.

In a statement that could hurt ties 
between Islamabad and New Delhi, the Director General of Pakistan 
military's media wing Asim Bajwa claimed that the arms and ammunition 
which the terrorists used could have been made in India.Â 

"Indian-made arms and ammunition were recovered from the militants," Major General Bajwa told reporters.

Not
 surprisingly, it gave Jamaat-ud-Dawa chief Hafiz Saeed an opportunity 
to criticise the Sharif-lead government's efforts to improve ties with 
India.

"#Karachi Airport is an attack on Pakistan. Modi's new security team is behind this act of war by India. Nation knows the real enemy," he tweeted on Monday.

Meanwhile, the Pakistan Taliban claimed responsibility for Sunday's attack and vowed to conduct more such strikes in future.

"It is a message to the Pakistan government that we are still alive to 
react over the killings of innocent people in bomb attacks on their 
villages. Also, it was a warning for the government that we can strike 
anywhere across Pakistan," Tehreek-e-Taliban Pakistan spokesman 
Shahidullah Shahid said.

"The main goal of this attack was to damage the government, including by hijacking planes and destroying state installations."

The terrorists attacked the Terminal One of the old airport with AK-47s, sub-machine guns and hand grenades.

Sources said they took control of the building exposing security lapses at the airport until reinforcements were called in.

The army operation to clear the airport continued for almost 10 hours.

"The security forces killed seven terrorists while three blew 
themselves up during the fight," Director General, Rangers, Major 
General Rizwan Akhtar told reporters.

A preliminary probe revealed that the terrorists used sophisticated weapons and were highly trained. They are believed to have complete information about every nook and corner of the airport.

Sources said the terrorists wanted to hijack a passenger plane to blackmail the government to free their commanders currently languishing in various Pakistani jails.

Major General Rizwan Akhtar, a senior army official who supervised the army operation, said only a DNA analysis of the terrorists could ascertain their identity.

"We will carry out DNA tests but their facial features suggest that they may be Uzbeks," he told reporters.

Sources from intelligence agencies said the government had been alerted about militants preparing to target sensitive installations in big cities.

The banned terrorist outfit Tehreek-e-Taliban Pakistan, also known as the Pakistani Taliban, has claimed the responsibility of attacking Karachi airport in which 29 people were killed, including 10 militants.

Pakistani authorities, who suggested the gunmen appeared to be Uzbeks, believe the group intended to destroy or hijack aircraft before they were stopped by the security personnel and commandos.

"We attacked the airport to avenge death of Hakimullah Mehsud, our late leader. There are many more to come as it is just the beginning," Shahidullah Shahid, Pakistani Taliban spokesperson said on Monday.

He also accused the Pakistan government of using peace talks as a tool of war.

Hakimullah Mehsud was killed in a US drone strike in November last year.

Sunday night's brazen attack on the Karachi airport was the first major terror attack by Pakistani Taliban since Prime Minister Nawaz Sharif came into power after winning general elections in May 2013.

According to Asim Qadeer Rana, a security defence analyst, the terror attack on the airport indicated that there can be more in the days to come.

"This fresh attack shows how agitated they are. One can expect more attacks in the future," Rana said.

Even though the Pakistani Taliban said they attacked the airport to avenge Mehsud's killing, many point out that the strike came soon after government-TTP talks ended.

The talks had continued for months with the aim to reach a peace deal. But soon after the peace talks collapsed last month, Pakistan Air force jets pounded suspected hideouts of militants in North Waziristan Agency.

The Air Force action eliminated dozens of militants, including various commanders of the TTP.

Authorities believe the airport attack resembles the May 2011 strike on the key Mehran Naval base in Karachi by heavily-armed terrorists.

Many were killed and aircraft, worth billions of Pakistani rupees, were destroyed. It was the fourth such attack on a heavily-guarded Navy installation that year.

Tehreek-e-Taliban militants involved in the assault on Karachi airport were carrying XStat devices that can heal gunshot wounds within seconds, a security official said on Monday.

These devices are used to stop bleeding and heal gunshot wounds in 15 to 20 seconds, a source in the paramilitary Rangers said. The security forces found XStat or Faxziat devices from the bags of these terrorists.

"Clearly they came with a long siege of the airport in mind," he added.

The device, normally used by military medics and emergency services, is an applicator filled with dozens of tiny sponges that soak up a 'ton of blood' when injected into an open wound.

Security at various airports has been beefed up following the terrorist attack on Pakistan's largest airport in Karachi. Security at Delhi's Indira Gandhi International Airport has also been tightened.

Security measures have been increased as per Standard Operating Procedures and joint patrolling by Delhi Police and CISF personnel are being carried out.
