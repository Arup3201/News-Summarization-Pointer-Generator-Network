A federal court is being asked to grant constitutional rights to five killer whales who perform at marine parks in an unprecedented and perhaps quixotic legal action.

People for the Ethical Treatment of Animals is accusing the SeaWorld parks of keeping five star-performer whales in conditions that violate the 13th Amendment ban on slavery. SeaWorld depicted the suit as baseless.

The chances of the suit succeeding are slim, according to legal experts not involved in the case; any judge who hews to the original intent of the authors of the amendment is unlikely to find that they wanted to protect animals. But PETA relishes engaging in the court of public opinion, as evidenced by its provocative anti-fur and pro-vegan campaigns.

The suit, which PETA says it will 
file on Wednesday in U.S. District Court in San Diego, hinges on the fact 
that the 13th Amendment, while prohibiting slavery and involuntary 
servitude, does not specify that only humans can be victims.

Jeff Kerr, PETA's general counsel, 
says his five-member legal team - which spent 18 months preparing the 
case - believes it's the first federal court suit seeking constitutional
rights for members of an animal species.

The plaintiffs are the five orcas, 
Tilikum and Katina based at SeaWorld in Orlando, Florida, and Corky, 
Kasatka and Ulises at SeaWorld San Diego. Tilikum, a six-ton male, made 
national news in February 2010 when he grabbed a trainer at the close of
a performance and dragged her underwater until she drowned.

Captured nearly 30 years ago off 
Iceland, Tilikum has enormous value as a stud and has fathered many of 
the calves born at SeaWorld parks.

The lawsuit asks the court to order 
the orcas released to the custody of a legal guardian who would find a 
'suitable habitat' for them.

'By any definition, these orcas are 
slaves - kidnapped from their homes, kept confined, denied everything 
that's natural to them and forced to perform tricks for SeaWorld's 
profit,' said Mr Kerr. 'The males have their sperm collected, the females 
are artificially inseminated and forced to bear young which are 
sometimes shipped away.'

SeaWorld said any effort to extend the 13th Amendment's protections beyond humans 'is baseless and in many ways offensive.'

'SeaWorld is among the world's most 
respected zoological institutions,' the company said. 'There is no 
higher priority than the welfare of the animals entrusted to our care 
and no facility sets higher standards in husbandry, veterinary care and 
enrichment.'

The statement outlined the many laws 
and regulations SeaWorld is obliged to follow, touted the company's 
global efforts to promote conservation of marine mammals, and said the 
orcas' performances help give the public a better appreciation and 
understanding of these animals.

SeaWorld and other U.S. marine parks 
are governed by the Marine Mammals Protection Act, which allows public 
displays of the creatures if permits are obtained and the facility 
offers and education/conservation programs for the public.

Overall, under prevailing U.S. legal 
doctrine, animals under human control are considered property, not 
entities with legal standing of their own. They are afforded some 
protections through animal-cruelty laws, endangered-species regulations 
and the federal Animal Welfare Act, but are not endowed with a distinct 
set of rights.

However, the field of animal law has 
evolved steadily, with courses taught at scores of law schools. Many 
prominent lawyers and academics have joined in serious discussion about 
expanding animal rights.

Rutgers University law professor Gary
Francione, for example, contends that animals deserve the fundamental 
right to not be treated as property. Law professor David Favre of 
Michigan State University has proposed a new legal category called 
'living property' as a step toward providing rights for some animals.

Mr Favre was sceptical that litigation seeking to apply the 13th Amendment to animals would prevail.

'The court will most likely not even 
get to the merits of the case, and find that the plaintiffs do not have 
standing to file the lawsuit at all,' he said by email. 'I also think a 
court would not be predisposed to open up that box with fully unknown 
consequences.'

Harvard law professor Laurence Tribe,
who in past writings has proposed extending legal standing to 
chimpanzees, also expressed doubt that the courts were ready to apply 
the 13th Amendment to animals. But he welcomed the PETA lawsuit as a 
potentially valuable catalyst for 'national reflection and deliberation'
about humans' treatment of animals.

'People may well look back at this 
lawsuit and see in it a perceptive glimpse into a future of greater 
compassion for species other than our own,' Tribe wrote in an email.

Tribe noted that some Americans might
find it bizarre or insulting to equate any treatment of animals to the 
sufferings of human slavery. But he argued that the 13th Amendment was 
written broadly, to address unforeseen circumstances, and could 
legitimately be applied to animals.

An African-American constitutional 
expert, Nicholas Johnson of Fordham University School of Law, said he 
could understand why some blacks might be insulted by the lawsuit, but 
didn't share that reaction: 'I'm more entertained by it in the legal 
context than I am offended by it.'

PETA addressed this issue in the 
suit, noting that repeated Supreme Court rulings have applied the 13th 
Amendment to many forms of involuntary servitude beyond the type of 
slavery that existed during the Civil War.

'The historical context is 
undeniable,' said Jeff Kerr, the PETA lawyer. 'But that's not what this 
case is about. It's about the orcas in their own right, not whether they
are or aren't similar to humans.'

The five orcas are represented in the
case by PETA and four individuals: Ric O'Barry, a longtime orca and 
dolphin trainer; Ingrid Visser, a New Zealand marine biologist who has 
studied orcas extensively; Howard Garrett, founder of the Orca Network, 
an advocacy group in Washington State; and Samantha Berg, a former orca 
trainer at SeaWorld Orlando.

The lawsuit details the distinctive 
traits of orcas, the largest species within the dolphin family, 
including their sophisticated problem-solving and communicative 
abilities and their formation of complex communities.

The suit alleges that captivity in 
the 'barren tanks' of a marine park suppresses the orcas' abilities and 
relationships, and subjects them to stress. This sometimes leads to 
instances where the orcas injure themselves, other orcas or humans that 
interact with them, according to the suit.

Naomi Rose, the Humane Society's 
marine mammal biologist, said there's a growing body of research 
suggesting that whales, dolphins and porpoises have the cognitive 
sophistication of three-to-four-year-old human children.

As for the orcas at SeaWorld, she said, 'They don't seem to adapt to captivity. I would say they're miserable.'

At SeaWorld San Diego, visitors are 
shown a film touting the park's rescue efforts that have saved thousands
of sea creatures. During the main performance, trainers point out how 
much the orcas are similar to humans: The babies cry before moving on to
babbling and finally imitating the crackling sounds of the adults' 
voices.

Jenny Raymond, 47, who was visiting 
from Switzerland, said she was delighted by the show and does not buy 
the argument that the orcas are slave labourers.

'I think they are in better conditions here than in the wild,' she said.
