A large fire has torn through several businesses in the main street of Nimbin destroying the northern NSW town's museum and well-known Rainbow Cafe.

As many as 34 firefighters and nine trucks were at the scene fighting to control the fire on Cullen Street which had one lane now open to traffic but the other lane and footpath would still be closed for some hours.

Despite the best efforts of firefighters, the blaze destroyed the cafe, adjoining museum and the Tribal Magic store - along with half the Bringabong shop before being brought under control.

Police say it was too early to say whether there ware suspicious circumstances and also quashed rumours that there had been an arrest over the fire.

However, Inspector Doug Connors said asbestos was a possibility as the buildings were old.

An overnight fire destroyed Nimbin's Rainbow Cafe and damaged several buildings in the main street

Several other buildings on Cullen Street suffered fire, smoke and water damage from the overnight blaze, although no-one was injured, Superintendent Michael Brett from the Rural Fire Service said.

'The reports we have is that the Rainbow Cafe has been destroyed, the museum which adjoins that has been destroyed, and there is another business adjoining the museum which has been destroyed,' he said.

Museum manager Michael Balderstone told ABC Local Radio the loss of the buildings would have a 'huge impact' on the town, which is famed for its drug history and alternative culture.

'It's really right in the middle of town, the Rainbow's probably the heart,' said.

'The museum's the biggest tourist attraction. It's a bloody mess.'

The fire has been extinguished and police will start investigations, said Mr Shepherd.

Balderstone, who has spent the past 30 years working and building the Nimbin Museum, said he understood this morning's fire started at the back of the Rainbow Cafe before spreading to the museum.

Mr Balderstone told The Northern Star that the fire was a 'kick in the guts' for Nimbin, but admits it could have been much worse.

He said Nimbin's fire crew arrived at the scene quickly and had been working to stop it leaping across the narrow gap to the neighbouring Nimbin Real Estate when instead it leapt the laneway between the cafe and the museum.

'When you see the size of the flames leaping out of it ... they have done well.'

Mr Balderstone said it was forunate there was little or no wind when the fire took hold or the damage might have been far worse.

'If there had been a breeze that whole side of the street could have gone,' he said.

''For a long time there has been the homeless element, the hopeless element. They are always in the middle of town at night ... and it's all old wooden buildings.

'It's winter and people light fires because it's cold.'

Residents took to Twitter to express their sadness about the devastation to the town with a population of about 350.

One local tweeted: 'So much of Nimbin in gone forever'

''Nimbin is on fire. Iconic museum has gone and more,' Julie Boyd ‚Äècommented.

''I can't believe the Rainbow Cafe and Nimbin Museum burned down last night. Its very sad,' another tweeted.

The cause of the fire was not yet known.
