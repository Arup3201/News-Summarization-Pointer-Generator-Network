Cristiano Ronaldo looked in good shape as the Real Madrid star trained with his Portugal team-mates ahead of their Euro 2016 qualifier against Armenia on Friday night.

The 29-year-old was wearing his new all-black Nike Mercurial Superfly boots as he was put through his paces at the Algarve Stadium in Faro.

Ronaldo was joined by the likes of Atletico Madrid star Tiago Mendes and former Manchester United winger Nani as the group enjoyed a session in the sun.

The latest Portugal squad saw former Chelsea full back Jose Bosingwa recalled by Portugal on Friday, four years after playing his last international.

The 32-year-old, who fell out with previous coach Paulo Bento, was included in the squad named by Fernando Santos for next Friday's Euro 2016 qualifier at home to Armenia and the friendly against Argentina in Manchester on November 18.

The former Porto, Chelsea and Queens Park Rangers player, who is now at Trabzonspor, won the last of his 24 caps in a 4-0 friendly win over Spain in November 2010.

Defenders Tiago Gomes and Raphael Guerreiro were called up for the first time while striker Helder Postiga was recalled after being left out of Fernando Santos's first two games in charge last month.
