With handsome, blue-eyed Jude Law as a father and sultry Sadie Frost as a mother, Rafferty Law has some of the best genes in the business.

And now, the youngster - who is the eldest son of the now-divorced A-list couple - appears to be following in his parent's footsteps to tinseltown.

The 16-year-old has been snapped up by a tailoring brand to star in their latest fashion film, A Different Cut.
