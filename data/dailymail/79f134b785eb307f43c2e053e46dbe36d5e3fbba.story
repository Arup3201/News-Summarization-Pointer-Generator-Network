The Spanish matador who lost his left eye in a horrific goring will make a remarkable return to the ring this weekend - wearing an eye patch.

Juan José Padilla, now dubbed 'The Pirate', will risk life and limb just five months after he was seen hobbling from a Zaragoza ring covered in blood screaming 'I can't see'.

Although he says he is 'fully prepared', he has admitted there will be an added element of danger - as he will not see the bull whenever it brushes past him on his blind left side.

Back in business: Juan Jose Padilla returns to the ring on Sunday, just five months after he lost his left eye in a horrific goring

Padilla, 38, was wounded in October after he slipped on the sand, a bull's horn pierced his jaw and it came out through his eye.

The crowds at the Zaragoza's Fiestas Del Pilar bullfight at the Misericordia ring were left stunned.

He then underwent a life-saving five-hour operation to repair severe damage to his eye, bone, muscle and skin - his face reconstructed with titanium plates and mesh.

On Sunday he will take on his first professional fight, since the goring, in the western town of Olivenza on Sunday.

Risky business: There will be an added element of danger for Juan Jose Padilla as he will not see the bull each time it passes on his blind left side

He said: 'Sunday will feel like a dream come true, after some very hard months, and I’m fully aware that nobody thought I would be back now.'

His wife Lidia and two children are said to be behind his lucrative return, but he added: 'My parents couldn't understand why I would want to.'

He also revealed he felt 'fully prepared' for the fight and had killed 10 bulls as practice on private farms.

It is not the first time Padilla, a popular matador who has won many fans for his courage and willingness to face the toughest bulls, has been gored.

After: With blood gushing from his face, and his assistants distracting the bull, Mr Padilla is helped from the ring

In 2001 the Jerez native suffered serious injuries to his neck during a fight in Pamplona.

His return to the ring comes as the intense debate over bullfighting in Spain continues - with supporters saying it is a key part of its culture and critics claiming it is animal cruelty.

The 'spectacle' has come under pressure since the 2007 start of the economic crisis, as public funds to promote fights are cut, and the region of Catalonia banned it in 2011.

But Spain's new conservative Prime Minister Mariano Rajoy is an avid fan and recently inspired the national television networks to start showing fights again.

Coverage had been abandoned in 2006 under the previous Socialist administration.
