What better way to celebrate your 65th birthday than aboard a 130ft yacht in Mallorca?

While most sexagenarians might enjoy an afternoon tea party or a quiet family bash, fashion designer Vera Wang and twelve friends partied hard at the Nikki Beach property in Calvia, the island's newest hotspot.

Wang and pals dined on sushi and indulged in an enormous six-litre bottle of Nikki Beach Rose, before heading to the beach to dance under the island sunset.

The arrival of Nikki Beach has been tipped as playing a key role in 
Mallorca’s transformation of Calvia beach into a luxury travel 
destination.

In recent years, millions of pounds have been invested in 
the region, with luxurious marinas and Michelin-starred 
restaurants such as Port Adriano, a £560million architectural wonder designed 
by Phillipe Starck, which is helping to attract the Jet-Set crowds to 
the area.

Nikki Beach Mallorca opened for its third summer season on in May, offering guests the Ultimate Beach Club experience, with its signature plush, all-white sun beds, chic drapery and white teepees making it a luxurious day party venue for the world’s Jet-Sets, VIPs and celebrity clientele.

Just 25 minutes’ drive from central Palma, the property is located near Calvia on the island’s West coast.

It is made up of a beach club, two restaurants including a poolside and a seafront restaurant, a cocktail bar and a boutique.

The club also offers an area for beauty treatments, an exclusive zodiac yacht pick-up service for guests, seafront dining and an extensive champagne and cocktail list.

This season the beach club is set to launch a new fine dining menu which will include a range of fresh, locally caught seafood, sushi served on dragon boat platters and seasonal salads with an international twist.

Vera Wang is not the only celebrity to 
celebrate their birthday at a Nikki Beach beach club: Twilight 
actor celebrated his 29th birthday at Nikki Beach in Phuket, Thailand, 
in March.

The hotel collection, which started life in Miami, has glamorous properties all over the world, including Ibiza, Marbella, Marrakech, St Barths and St Tropez.
