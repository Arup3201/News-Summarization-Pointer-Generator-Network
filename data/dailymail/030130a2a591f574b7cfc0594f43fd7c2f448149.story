Chris Borland is walking away from the NFL after his rookie season because of concerns about the long-term effects of head trauma.

The 24-year-old linebacker told the San Francisco 49ers on Friday and made the announcement on ESPN's Outside the Lines.

After consulting with eminent concussion reserachers and his family, Borland decided to call it quits on a promising NFL career.

'I just honestly want to do what's best for my health,' Borland told the show. 'From what I've researched and what I've experienced, I don't think it's worth the risk.'

'I just thought to myself, "What am I doing? Is this how I'm going to live my adult life, banging my head, especially with what I've learned and knew about the dangers?'"

Borland has had two concussions in his life; one playing soccer in eighth grade and the next while playing football at high school.

He said he took a head shot in training camp last season and opted to play through it.

Borland has retired from the NFL after one year

Borland's year in San Francisco yielded 107 tackles, two interceptions and was awarded NFC Defensive Player of the Week and received a vote for Defensive Rookie of the Year.

His announcement is a further blow to the 49ers, who are in a state of flux since former head coach Jim Harbaugh left the Bay Area.

Fellow linebacker Patrick Willis also took the decision to retire after eight years in the NFL, to leave the 49ers in strife in a previous position of strength.

Borland and Willis join 27-year-old Jason Worilds, who quit the Pittsburgh Steelers after five years in the NFL, and Jake Locker, 26, who also announced his decision to turn his back on the game.

Jeff Miller, the NFL's senior vice president of health and safety policy, released in a statement.

'We respect Chris Borland's decision and wish him all the best. Playing any sport is a personal decision.

'By any measure, football has never been safer and we continue to make progress with rule changes, safer tackling techniques at all levels of football, and better equipment, protocols and medical care for players. 

'Concussions in NFL games were down 25 percent last year, continuing a three-year downward trend. We continue to make significant investments in independent research to advance the science and understanding of these issues. We are seeing a growing culture of safety. Everyone involved in the game knows that there is more work to do and player safety will continue to be our top priority.'

Borland's announcement took the 49ers by surprise. 

'While unexpected, we certainly respect Chris' decision, general manager Trent Baalke said in a statement. 

'From speaking with Chris, it was evident that he had put a great deal of thought into this decision. He was a consummate professional from day one and a very well respected member of our team and community. Chris is a determined young man that overcame long odds in his journey to the NFL and we are confident he will use the same approach to become very successful in his future endeavors. We will always consider him a 49er and wish him all the best.'
