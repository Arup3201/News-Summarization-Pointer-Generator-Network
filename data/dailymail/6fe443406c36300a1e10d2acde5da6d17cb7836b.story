Plans to shoot scenes for the new James Bond film in a graveyard in Rome have been blocked, by a mysterious and ancient religious order.

Daniel Craig is filming his fourth 007 movie Spectre in Italy, including a scene in which Bond attends a funeral.

But the Archconfraternity of the Departed, a religious order which historically provided burial for the poor and destitute, and which still has sway over the cemetery, has refused entry to cast and crew.

The graveyard, built on the site of a Roman necropolis, has been a place of burial for some twenty centuries.

The order of brothers are thought to have blocked the arrival of the elaborate film set so as to ‘respect the sanctity’ of the tombs, according to Rome-based newspaper Il Messaggero. ‘They won’t want an invasion of trucks and heavy goods vehicles inside the cemetery,’ it said.

The production team are scrambling to rework the scene so it can take place in the piazza outside the Museum of Roman Civilisation, in the fascist-era district of EUR, built by Mussolini.

On Wednesday the office of Mayor Ignazio Marino received a request ‘to film part of the footage previously expected to be filmed at the Cemetery of Verano, at the space in front of the Museum of Roman Civilisation following technical problems that have arisen with the Arciconfraternita dei Trapassati.’

The veto is the only the latest setback faced by the Bond team.

Officials also blocked filming at the intersection of four 16th century fountains, where Bond was due to take part in a high-speed pursuit, because they were too fragile and too close to Italy’s presidential palace.

And in December, nine cars customised for filming scenes in the Alps were reported stolen from a garage before they were due to be shipped to the set.

An early version of the script was stolen during the cyber-attack on Sony Pictures, prompting fears that it would be published before the film’s release.

But the filmmakers did manage to postpone proposed new legislation which would have required expensive testing on all guns used on film sets.

Rooted in tradition that goes back to the fourth century and later in the order of the ‘Brothers of the Good Death’ the Arch-confraternity’s mission until the 20th century was to provide assistance to the sick and ensure a proper burial to all even if they could not afford it. Since the 1960s it has been in a slow decline. 

Location: They were filming in the snowy mountains of Sölden, Austria as well as Obertilliach and Lake Altaussee

Hot wheels: Sports cars were lined up outside Bleinheim Palace in Woodstock, Oxfordshire, on Thursday ready for more shoots
