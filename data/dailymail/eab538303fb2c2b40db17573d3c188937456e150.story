A heavily pregnant Mariah Carey painted her baby bump with a picture of a butterfly last year.

And now a growing number of women are choosing to celebrate pregnancy in a similar way.

From a lifelike depiction of an unborn baby in an egg shell to an adorable little boy taking a bath, these incredible photographs show how the shape of an expectant mother's stomach forms a perfect round canvas.

Throughout her pregnancy, Chinese-born Luo Qianxi has painted pictures of her growing baby on her stomach. 

Luo is a painter by profession and speaking about her designs she said: 'Some people write pregnancy diaries or take pictures to record the process, while I choose to paint.'
