Tami Martin-Dietrich was left paralyzed from the waist down following a car crash in 1999.

But on her wedding day, the paraplegic bride-to-be stood up - and walked down the aisle.

With a gait trainer tucked under her stunning white gown, the 44-year-old defied her doctors and walked the 69 feet to her teary-eyed fiancé, Rob Martin-Dietrich, at Disney World's Wedding Pavilion in Florida.

And it wasn't her only incredible achievement - she also managed to lose around 192lbs gained from inactivity - in time for the wedding, despite being wheelchair-bound.

Speaking to DailyMail.com, Tami described the moment she stunned guests by walking down the aisle on September 6 - the first time she has walked in public in 15 years - as 'magical'.

'I had always wanted to walk down the aisle, but I'd been told I would never walk again. At first, I thought I would just stand up to say my vows. But on the day, I thought, "I'm going to do this".

'I'd done three weeks of intense physical therapy, and the therapists had helped me to stand up and take a few steps. But none of them were available on the day of the wedding.

'So I put my faith in God and walked 69 feet in public for the first time. It was a magical experience. To say that for 15 years I hadn't been able to walk and then I was walking down the aisle toward Rob.

'No-one expected that. There wasn't a dry eye in the room.'

Incredibly, Tami had bought her dream dress months earlier from Bridals by Lori in March 2014 with the whole process will featured on Say Yes To The Dress Atlanta on January 30 2015

Strength-building: The 44-year-old went through hours of grueling therapy sessions and slowly the pounds slipped away(before, left, right, after the weight loss)

'I will never be told I can't do anything,' said Tami. 'I will not take no for an answer. 

'I don't give up. It was the same with the weight loss - I wouldn't stop until I was 148lbs. I ended up being 117lbs.'

Tami, who weighed 309lbs at one point during her rehabilitation sessions, would not have been able to walk down the aisle without the weight loss. She was aided in her efforts by a surgical procedure.

However, she also attributes her success to several other factors.

These include zumba classes, scuba diving, dancing, supplements, determination and the support of her groom-to-be, who is a specialist in nutrition, and therefore 'knows how to eat healthily'. 

'It costs a lot to be overweight,' said Rob, who runs his own business creating websites.

'Once she decided to lose the weight, she needed a support system in place to help her through it.'

Describing the moment he saw his future wife walk down the aisle, the 45-year-old added: 'It was amazing. There was a lot of pressure on Tami and she was incredible.

'Seeing her come through the doors and walk toward me was just amazing.'

Tami was left seriously injured after the car she was traveling in crashed on October 25, 1999.

Fairytale ending: Disney World's Wedding Pavilion in Florida proved to be the perfect setting for Tami

At the time, she was wearing a seatbelt, but had reclined her seat, meaning she was not properly secured. As a result, she was left with a broken back and a crushed spine.

'There wasn't a physical mark on my body, but my spine was crushed. They told me I would never walk again,' she said, adding that she was underwent 40 hours of therapy per week after the crash.

Eleven years later, in 2010, Tami met Rob, who is originally from Australia, via eHarmony. 

However, they only met in person for the first time in May 29th 2013. For Tami, it was love at first sight.

'I knew from the minute I met him that I was going to marry him,' she told DailyMail.com. 

Incredibly, Rob did not know his future wife was paraplegic - until she arranged to visit Sydney and he met her at the airport. This is despite her having dropped hints into their phone conversations. 

'He showed up at the airport to pick me up, but he did not realize I was in a wheelchair until I arrived,' said Tami, adding that she had mentioned she would be bringing some equipment with her.

Rob said that although Tami told him to look up the names of the equipment on Google, he 'didn't want to.' 'When I saw she was in a wheelchair I was like "Ok". We had a brilliant two weeks,' he said.

After meeting at the airport, the pair explored Sydney together. In subsequent months, Rob, who has a son,  moved to Atlanta. He proposed in a hotel in front of Hilton Head Lighthouse on September 3, 2013.

Before the proposal, Rob made sure he gained permission from Tami's entire family for her hand in marriage, including a 'yes' from her dementia-suffering uncle Lennie Martin, who replied: 'It's about time!'

Almost there: Incredibly, Tami had bought her dress for her 'dream' Disney-themed wedding years earlier - and it was simply luck that the gait trainer could fit beneath it, aiding her as she walked down the aisle (pictured)

During their engagement, Tami continued - and still continues - to undergo hours of therapy at First Step Physical Therapy, where Dr Sue Leger and Dr Josh Davis encouraged her to  stand up.

Rob said the treatment has worked wonders for his wife.

'She never used to feel anything from the waist down, but now she's feeling,' he said.

'She can almost hold her weight on the parallel bars.

'It's  taught us that even if you have physical issues, putting mind over matter can really help you to live a normal life. But you also have to have the right support system around you.' 

Now, the inspirational couple are set to move into a new house in Atlanta together.

And Tami has only bigger and better plans for the future - she hopes to start a family, walk longer distances without the aid of anything, and is even considering becoming a motivational speaker.

'The sky is the limit. I am open to anything, whatever God has planned for me,' she said. 

She also hopes to continue to raise awareness of the dangers of reclining your seat while traveling.
