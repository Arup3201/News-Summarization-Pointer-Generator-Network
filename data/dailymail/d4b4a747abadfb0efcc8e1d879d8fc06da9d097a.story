The National Football League (NFL) has defended two referees who were filmed fist-bumping after Denver Broncos' star C.J. Anderson scored a second touchdown during Sunday's game.

The 23-year-old running back scored his one-yard touchdown in the second quarter of the team's 24-17 win against the Buffalo Bills at Sports Authority Field at Mile High in Denver, Colorado. 

As he and his teammates celebrated, line judge John Hussey and umpire Carl Paganelli were caught on video discretely fist-bumping after making what turned out to be a correct call.

Their celebration sparked anger among several of the Bills' players, with safety Aaron Williams later taking to social media to express his disgust at the gesture.

The 24-year-old posted a link to a video of the officials' fist-bump to Twitter, alongside the caption: 'No excuse for my performance, but can't win playing 16 vs 11, thought I'd seen it all...'

In fact, there are nine officials for NFL games, so it would have actually made it 20 vs 11, in accordance with Williams's feelings toward the referees' loyalty.

Despite a number of complaints, the NFL had no problem with the gesture.

'It was an acknowledgment of good mechanics between the two officials involved in making the call,' NFL spokesman, Michael Signora, said.

Indeed, it was a difficult call because Anderson bulled through the center of the line, making it hard for Mr Hussey - who was standing on the sideline - to see if the ball had crossed the plane of the goal line before the runner's knee hit the turf.

Mr Paganelli's job - from the middle of the field - is to stick his nose into the pile and help the line judge figure it out. He did that, then gave Mr Hussey the thumbs up.

The latter signaled touchdown, before the pair gave each other the subtle, hip-high fist bump.

A minute later, replay confirmed the call.

Despite the NFL's statement, Williams's anger at the fist-bump was apparently felt by many social media users, with more than 1,000 followers having 'favorited' his tweet by 2am.
