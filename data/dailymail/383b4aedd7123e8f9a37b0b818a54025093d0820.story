The actor explained that he got rid of the beard for Yoga Hosers, an upcoming movie also starring Johnny Depp and Haley Joel Osment.

He shared a 'before' picture of the facial hair in all its glory, with the caption: 'This is my magic beard. Enjoy it now: tomorrow, I am going to shave it off for #YogaHosers !'

And the 'after' picture, in which he stares wide-eyed at the camera, bares the caption: 'Look at this goofy spaz. This is me, beardless, for the #YogaHosers green screen shoot. It's a Face-Brazilian!'
