Facing jail: Elesha Proud-Miles, 18, narrowly avoided being hit by a train

A pregnant teenager who brought rush hour Tube trains to a standstill when she ran along the tracks trying to dodge her rail fare was warned she faces jail today.

Elesha Proud-Miles, 18, narrowly avoided being hit by a Victoria Line train as she dashed across the rails at Finsbury Park Station, in north London.

The expectant mother, who is five months pregnant, was fleeing police when she jumped off the platform and into a tunnel used by high speed trains.

She had earlier punched a police officer in the face during a foul-mouthed tirade when she was caught trying to jump the barriers without paying for her train journey.

District judge Elizabeth Roscoe said Proud-Miles must be dealt with by a crown court judge, who has tougher sentencing powers, and warned she is likely to be locked up.

‘I think the sentence you are likely to receive is too severe for this court, this is a really serious offence’, she said.

‘I think this is likely to be prison.’

Proud-Miles hopped on to the tracks and was seen clambering back on to another platform before running on to the tracks again, at around 10am on August 6 this year. 

‘The defendant was seen in the mouth 
of the tunnel, passing through a barrier at the end of the platform and 
entering the tunnel’, prosecutor Ravinder Chodha told Westminster 
Magistrates Court

‘She 
was close to the tunnel wall, and a driver applied the emergency brakes 
after seeing the defendant was not standing still.’

Several trains had to be evacuate as the Victoria Line was brought to a standstill.

Proud-Miles
arrived at the station without a ticket to get through the exit barrier
or any money, and soon began hurling expletive ridden abuse at PCSO 
Yakubu Musah.

She tried to give a fake name and address to the officer before trying to sneak through the barriers behind another passenger.

She then told PCSO Musah: ‘What are you going to f***ing do, I’m not afraid of a f***ing police officer’.

PCSO Musah told the court: ‘She double shuffled through the barriers and made no attempt to use a ticket to get through.

‘I grabbed her wrist and held her back, telling her to come back.’

Proud-Miles continued to scream abuse at the officer while he radioed for help, and then punched him in the mouth.

‘It was hard enough to cause my head to jerk backwards and made my hat fall off my head’, he said.

As station staff and police officers rushed to help, Proud-Miles started to lean backwards over the edge of the platform, saying ‘I’m pregnant, you can’t do anything to me’.

Challenge: Westminster Magistrates Court heard that she had earlier punched a police officer in the face during a foul-mouthed tirade when she was caught trying to jump the barriers without paying for her train journey

She then dangled her legs off the edge of the platform as fast trains continued to steam through the station.

Police and rail staff tried to coax her back on to the platform, but then she got down on to the track and walked along it, the officer said.

After she had run into the tunnel and forced trains to be stopped, she continued to ignore the assistance of train staff.

‘The train driver stopped his train halfway into the platform and contacted control to switch off the electricity to the tracks’, Ms Chodha said.

‘All the trains in the area then came to a stop.

‘He then got out of the train and told the defendant to get into the train, but he says she simply brushed past him and said no.

‘She continued to walk through the tunnel and was eventually arrested by police officers and taken to hospital.’

Proud-Miles, of Wandsworth, SW London, admitted obstructing a train, disobeying rail safety notices, and assaulting PCSO Musah.

The court heard the teenager already has a string of convictions to her name, including several assaults dating back to 2008 and a common assault in 2011.

She was also forced to relocate from Islington, in north London, after being sentenced to nine months in youth detention in April this year for assault occasioning actual bodily harm.

Proud-Miles was released on unconditional bail and will now be sentenced at Blackfriars Crown Court on a date yet to be set.

She could face up to two years in prison for the offence of obstructing a train alone.
