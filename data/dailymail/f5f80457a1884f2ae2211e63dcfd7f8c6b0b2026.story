A 26-year-old Chinese man yawned so violently he suffered a collapsed lung.

Mr Ou, from Wuhan in China’s Hubei Province, is believed to have ripped a hole in his lung as he stretched and yawned one morning.

Doctors believe his tall, thin physique was to blame for the unusual injury.

Mr Ou suffered a spontaneous pneumothorax (pictured - file picture) which occurs when air becomes trapped next to a lung. The condition is most common in tall, thin young men

Mr Ou felt a sudden pain in his chest after yawning but, at first, he ignored it, ecns.cn reports.

He eventually went for treatment at the Central Hospital of Wuhan after the pain became so intense he struggled to breathe.

Medics at the hospital found Mr Ou had experienced spontaneous pneumothorax – this occurs when air becomes trapped next to a lung.

Most cases occur spontaneously and in young men - some cases develop as a result of a chest injury or lung disease and sometimes a tiny tear in the lung is responsible.

The most common symptom is a sudden, sharp chest pain followed by pains during inhalation.

In most cases, it clears without needing treatment but the air needs clearing if it causes problems with breathing.

It is believed that Mr Ou tore a hole in his lung while yawning and stretching as he suffered a sudden pain immediately after yawning. File picture

The condition occurs in about two in every 10,000 young adults but men are four times more likely to be affected than women.

Chen Baojun, from the Central Hospital’s cardiothoracic surgery department, said this condition can have many causes but that tall, slim young men are known to be an at-risk group.

Mr Ou is believed to be 5ft 9ins tall and weighs just 9st 4lbs.
