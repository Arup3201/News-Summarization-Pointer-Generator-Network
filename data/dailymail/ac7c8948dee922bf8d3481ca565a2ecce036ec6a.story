Summer has descended on the northeastern U.S. like a fire-breathing dragon.

The National Weather Service predicted record-breaking temperatures on yesterday's summer solstice - and the blistering heat is set for round two today for 50 million Americans.

The mercury is expected to climb to nearly 100 degrees today - if not higher - in cities including Philadelphia, New York and Boston.

The National Weather Service has issued heat advisories and excessive heat warnings in 12 states, from Virginia to Maine.

Dozens of people attending graduation
ceremonies were hospitalized due to the heat, causing emergency 
responders to redirect ambulances to what were supposed to be festive 
occasions.

According to the National Weather Service, the temperature yesterday was 93 
degrees in New York City's Central Park, but with humidity it felt like 
97. In Boston, it felt like 100 but was 93. In Washington, it felt like 
101 but was 97.

In New Britain, Connecticut, 24 people had to be treated for heat exhaustion at a high school graduation ceremony, according to WFSB.

Anticipating
the scorcher, the New Britain Fire Department set up cooling centers 
for people to get out of the sun and hydrate. 2,000 cups of water were distributed to the 6,000 attendees.

Those efforts were not 
enough, however, and 18 ambulances had to be called to the scene.

A similar scene took place at a graduation in North Bergen, New Jersey. Ambulances were on standby at the event, which was held 
outside to accommodate about 5,000 people, said Capt. Gerald Sanzari of 
the North Bergen Police Department.

In Howell, N.J., school officials made Wednesday the last day of the 
school year instead of Thursday, citing the heat. And at nearby Wall 
High School, people attending the graduation ceremony will be able to 
watch a remote broadcast inside the air-conditioned building.

Vincent, a mail carrier, was already sweating as she began her rounds 
in a residential neighborhood in Manchester, Conn., Wednesday morning.

'There's
nothing you can do,' she said as she dabbed her face with wet 
washcloths. 'Tomorrow's my day off, thank God. I've just got to make it 
through today.'

In a rare bending of the rules, the Metro in Washington, D.C., said 
passengers on Wednesday and Thursday would be allowed to drink water, an
exception to their no-drinks policy. The National Weather Service said 
the temperature at Washington National Airport was 95 degrees just 
before 2 p.m., though it felt like 99.

But as the mercury rises 
across the East, other parts of the country were ravaged with rain, as 
floods swept through Minnesota, closing schools, universities and main 
roads.

In stark contrast in the Eastern 
states, health officials warned residents to drink water, stay out of 
the sun and in air conditioning, and check on their elderly neighbors 
and on their pets.

Cities 
further inland will also see temperatures surge into the 90s on 
Wednesday, including Pittsburgh, Pennsylvania and Burlington, Vermont.

Sweltering
heat will also pummel areas further west in the Great Lakes and Ohio 
Valley, including Chicago, Detroit, Cleveland and Louisville, Kentucky.

After weeks of relatively mild June temperatures, Philadelphia may see the mercury soar to 97 and 99 degrees mid-week.

Across the mid-Atlantic, the Weather Channel predicted temperatures would top out at 105 degrees, when the humidity and heat index were calculated.

'We're very lucky that the pools opened yesterday,' James Garrow, from the Philadephia health department said.

An area of high pressure off the East 
Coast, combined with a flow of warm, humid air coming from the South 
will heat things up, said Kristin Kline, a weather service meteorologist
in Mount Holly, N.J.

Normally, the high for Philadelphia for 
the official start of summer is about 84 degrees, closer to Wednesday's 
predicted low of 80 degrees. The city's highs in the next couple of days
could break decades-old records of 98 degrees, set in 1931, and 99, set
in 1923.

'You're talking about almost 15 degrees above normal,' Kline said.

The
heat also will hit Boston-area residents hard. Triple digits are 
forecast in Boston — 101 degrees on Wednesday — followed by 99 on 
Thursday, the weather service said. Current record highs for these dates
are 98 and 95 degrees, respectively.

New
York City's 1.1 million public school students are still in session — 
until June 27 — and just 64 percent of the classrooms are 
air-conditioned. Temperatures are expected to hit 97 in the city both 
days.

Students were being advised to wear 
light clothing and drink plenty of water, and schools have been told to 
limit outdoor playtime, city Education Department spokeswoman Marge 
Feinberg said.

Forecasts
for upstate New York on Wednesday and Thursday called for temperatures 
to break 90 from Buffalo to the Vermont border, with highs topping out 
in the mid-90s in some places.

Philadelphia began a staggered 
schedule of opening its swimming pools, a couple of days after schools 
let out for the year. Nearly two dozen of the city's 70 pools will be 
open by Wednesday, with another seven opening Thursday.

Garrow
said Philadelphia will activate its heat hotline at noon Wednesday and 
will work with personal care homes, senior centers, libraries and 
recreation centers to make sure air conditioners are running.

Officials will be setting up 114 'cooling centers' at facilities across the city, he said.

The Southeastern Pennsylvania 
Transportation Authority, the state's largest transit agency, is keeping
a close eye on the heat as well, spokeswoman Jerri Williams said.

Cooling off: Friday will not be quite as hot and the weekend forecast is more bearable

SEPTA, which operates trains, trolleys 
and buses in Philadelphia and its suburbs, planned to have extra 
maintenance workers to help deal with heat-related switch failures, 
problems with track expansion and any overhead wire issues on suburban 
train lines.

Every state in the Lower 48 except for North Dakota was forecast to 
have 90-degree weather until Saturday, according to a model by the 
National Oceanic and Atmospheric Administration, the agency in charge of
weather, climate and oceans.

On New York's Long Island, Roy 
Gross, chief of the Suffolk County SPCA, cautioned against keeping pets 
in vehicles, noting temperatures can reach 120 degrees within minutes.

'Your pet can quickly suffer brain damage or die from heatstroke when trapped in these high temperatures,' Gross said.

In
Manhattan's Washington Square Park, women and small children took off 
their shoes to wade in a fountain. But the main attraction was a 
promotion by Nestle to give away a free ice cream cone to anyone who 
would do the hula hoop.

Residents
in Minnesota would no doubt like a turn with the scorching weather, 
after they suffered hours of torrential rain on Tuesday and Wednesday 
morning.

Six inches fell 
overnight in the northern part of the state, with some officials 
branding it the most severe flooding they had seen in decades.

Heavy rainfall and flash floods left roads under water and caused sinkholes and 
mudslides across Duluth and the North Shore. Universities, roads and town halls shut due to the extreme weather.

One of the hardest hit landmarks was the Lake Superior Zoo, the Duluth News Tribune reported, with keepers frantically searching for animals as the park became submerged in water.

Keepers were hunting for a missing polar bear and recovered an AWOL seal in the early hours of Wednesday.

Other
parts of the country suffered with extreme weather earlier this week, 
with parts of Arizona, California, Colorado, Idaho and Wyoming battling 
wildfires in the dry, arid heat and swirling winds.

On Tuesday, Tropical Storm Chris formed over the Atlantic Ocean, but no posed no threat to land.

It swirled to life 560 miles south-southwest of Cape Race, Newfoundland, and reached top winds of 45 miles per hour, the U.S. National Hurricane Center said.
