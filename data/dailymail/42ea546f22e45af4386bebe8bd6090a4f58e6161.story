A Boston University student group is demanding the school cancel an upcoming Robin Thicke concert, complaining that the lyrics to the singer’s 2013 smash Blurred Lines are sexist.

More than 1,600 people have signed an online petition started by members of Humanists of Boston University to get Thicke’s March 4 date at the school’s Agganis Arena cancelled.

‘Thicke’s hit song, Blurred Lines, celebrates having sex with women against their will,’ the group’s petition at change.org states.

A Boston University student group is demanding the school cancel an upcoming Robin Thicke concert, complaining that the lyrics to the singer's 2013 smash Blurred Lines are sexist

Number one: Despite controversy the Blurred Lines single topped the Billboard Hot 100 chart last year

‘Lyrics such as, “I know you want it,” explicitly use non-consensual language. And while watching the extremely explicit video, the insinuations grow from subtle to explicit to obnoxious.’

‘Clearly, Boston University has been a bedrock for feminism and ideologies of equality more generally. It is a dishonor to our feminist history to symbolically idolize Robin Thicke by allowing him to perform his misogynist music at our university,’ the petition adds.

‘We see this as a blatant form of reinforcing rape culture and sexism,’ Patrick Johnson, the organization’s president, told Fox.

Blurred Lines was a massive hit song globally last summer for married-singer Thicke.

'Rapey': Robin Thicke's lyrics and video for new single Blurred Lines have outraged people everywhere but also provided him with his biggest ever hit

The song - which he recorded with Pharrell and rapper T.I. - may have hit the number one spot on the 
Billboards Hot 100 chart but it was also lambasted for its misogyny.

The lyrics were accused of being 'rapey' and the controversial video featured woman prancing around wearing nothing but thongs, while the fully dressed male singers ogled then and sang 'I know you want it'.

Thicke infamously performed his massive hit at the MTV Awards along with Miley Cyrus and during the Grammy Awards show in January. The song was a Grammy nominee.

A university spokesman says it is unlikely the show would be canceled. He said Boston University had nothing to do with booking the show, one stop on a 16-show tour.

An email to a Thicke spokeswoman was not immediately returned.

Too risque: The unrated video for Blurred Lines was banned by YouTube for obvious nudity

The unrated version of the video was 
banned from YouTube for the obvious nudity, while a censored version has drawn over 250million views.

Other parts of the video feature T.I. brushing Emily Ratajkowski’s hair and a blonde woman lighting Robin's cigarette before he blows smoke in her face.

In addition, silver balloons spell out 'Robin Thicke has a big d***' and verse three of the song's lyrics are: 'I'll give you something big enough to tear your a** in two.'

Tricia Romano of The Daily Beast wrote a commentary enitled Robin Thicke’s Summer Anthem, Is Kind of Rapey.

She wrote: 'The subject [of the song]
 itself is enough to make some female music fans uncomfortable. The song
 is about how a girl wants crazy wild sex but doesn’t say it - positing 
that age-old problem where men think no means yes into a catchy, 
hummable song.'

Lisa Huynh of Feminist in LA first 
slammed the song in April and wrote: 'Has anyone heard Robin Thicke's 
new rape song? Basically, the majority of the song … has the R&B 
singer murmuring ‘I know you want it’ over and over into a girl’s ear.

Sexist: The video caused a stir because while Thicke and his fellow male performers, Pharrell and T.I., are dressed, the woman wear very little

In the nude: The women wear just thongs in the video, while the men remain fully clothed

'Call me a cynic, but that phrase does not exactly encompass the notion of consent in sexual activity.'

And Thicke's comments about the video didn't exactly help him to win back female fans.

In an interview with May's GQ magazine he said: 'We
 tried to do everything that was taboo - bestiality, drug injections, and everything that is completely 
derogatory towards women.'

'What a pleasure it is to degrade a woman,' he continued. 'I’ve never gotten to do that before. I’ve always respected women.'

The 36-year-old singer- who is 
happily married to actress Paula Patton - tried to defend the song on 
the basis that both Pharrell and T.I. are 'happily married with 
children' and that because they are settled in their personal lives they
 were both 'the perfect guys to make this.'

Thicke previously said that director Diane Martel came up with the idea of using nude models.

'As long as it's fun and the girls are comfortable let's do something silly,' Thicke said. 'Let's take some chances.'

Charming: Thicke has admitted that the inspiration for the single was being 'derogatory to women'

Blatant misogyny: The video in large part is made up of the men ogling the scantily clad women while pulling or brushing their hair and whispering 'I know you want it' into their ears
