A 14-year-old schoolboy drowned in thousands of litres of raw sewage when he slipped and fell into a septic tank during a lesson break, say police in Romania.

Claudiu Cristea had been showing off to classmates by lifting the tank's heavy steel lid to show his strength at school in the village of Coltesti in southern Romania.

But his horrified friends told police that he lost his grip and fell into the giant cesspit, with the lid crashing down on top of him.

Unable to climb out, police say he was overcome by the fumes and passed out, drowning in the contents of the tank.

Police spokeswoman Elena Petrescu said: 'The other boys ran for help but by the time the school staff pulled him out it was too late.'

Anger: The boy's distraught father, Alexei Cristea, demanded to know why the tank did not have a lock on it and where his teachers were when the tragedy happened

Grief: Mourners follow Claudiu's coffin as it is taken through the streets of Coltesti for his funeral

Pain: Villagers lined the streets and wept as the boy's body was taken to his funeral

Now the boy's heartbroken parents are demanding to know how their son was able to lift the tank lid that should have been locked, and why staff on playground duty did not spot him.

The boy's distraught father, Alexei Cristea, said: 'If this tank is so dangerous why doesn't it have a lock on it? Why isn't it behind a fence?'

He added: 'And where were those teachers when my son needed them? Back in the staff room, that's where.'

County chief schools inspector Ion Gherghinaru said: 'The boy lost his life in the first break on the day between 8.50am and 9am. We are investigating whether his teachers are responsible in some way.'
