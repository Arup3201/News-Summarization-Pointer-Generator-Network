A Texas bar has been forced to issue an apology and sack an employee after a hand-written sign joking about domestic violence appeared on a sign outside.

A sign on a board outside Minibar in Austin read: 'I like my beer like I like my violence: domestic.'

Incensed local resident Seetha Kulandaisamy took a photo of the offending sign and posted it on the website Reddit.

Highly offensive: A Texas bar has been forced to issue an apology and sack an employee after a hand-written sign joking about domestic violence appeared on a sign outside

Making amends: A new sign was appeared outside the bar following the furore

'I walked by the sign on Friday night, and my first response was just anger,' Ms Kulandaisamy told ABC News.

'I currently am a volunteer at the women’s shelter in Austin, so my sensitivity is extra high, but I think my reaction would have been the same regardless. Not only was it offensive, but it was also just bad humor.'

The following morning the bar's owners removed the sign.

They also fired the employee responsible for posting the sign.

'Minibar doesn’t condone that sign,' owner Alex Elmiger told the broadcaster.

'I give my utmost apology and assure it won’t happen again. As soon as it was brought to my attention, I wanted to do something to rectify the situation.'

A new sign is now in place outside the bar that states  $1 of every domestic beer sold in the month of October will to the National Coalition Against Domestic Violence, in recognition of domestic violence awareness month.#

They posted a photo of the new sign on their Facebook page which was inundated with complaints alongside the comment: ' I assure everyone yesterday was an isolated incident and was definitely not a reflection of minibar what so ever.'

Earlier this year a vegetarian-friendly restaurant in Houston, Texas, ran an offensive sign on its marquee comparing domestic beer to domestic violence.

‘Beer should be like violence: domestic,’ Roots Bistro’s controversial sign read, sparking outrage across the Internet.

The backlash came almost instantaneously, causing the restaurant to remove the sign within 10 minutes.

The restaurant then added insult to 
injury and sparked more fury with a sign on the same marquee that read: 
‘Seriously, focus your energy on equal rights.’

The restaurant later posted a new sign on its marquee that read: ‘Sorry a million times over Houston.’

Domestic violence is the leading cause 
of injury to women between the ages of 15 and 44 in the United States, 
more than car accidents, muggings and rapes combined, according to a 
Senate judiciary report.
