Just when you think you've seen it all, the hipsters manage to surprise again. 

The news yesterday, that an advertising company in east London had launched a range of beard baubles seriously tickled MailOnline readers. 

And today, a group of men from the capital have gone one better - turning their facial fuzz into festive works of art. 

The four males have paid as much attention to decorating their chin bristles as they would their Christmas tree, attaching anything from robin's nests, to fake icicles and candy canes.

The gentleman all hail from fashionable Shoreditch, where beards are very much in fashion 

Visual artist Katya Wildman spent six hours creating the four designs and photographed the end result using a Samsung Galaxy Note Edge handset. 

2014 has been the year of the beard - everywhere you look these days, men aged 18-40 are wearing their facial hair like a badge of honour. 

There are Tumblr pages galore dedicated to men with a strong whisker presence and a Mancunian has even launched a dating site specifically for pogonophiles. 

So, with Christmas around the corner, it was only right that companies are now inventing seasonal accessories for bearded men.

A London advertising agency has been selling beard baubles - for the man wanting to add an extra festive touch to his chin fuzz.

The company claims that the Yuletide facial hair accessory - which retails for £5.00 ($7.80) a packet - has been flying off shelves, with customers from as far as Australia placing orders. 

Ollie Dearn, who works at the agency behind the accessory, Grey London, said: 'The product has been particularly popular with Brits.

'We've sold more than we ever expected.

'But Aussie, American, Kiwis, German and French customers have been purchasing Beard Baubles too.'

Each pack contains 14 multicoloured baubles to attach to the bristles - ten large balls and four small ones.

A London advertising agency invented beard baubles as a decoration for their company Christmas card. The facial accessories are now a global hit, with customers in the US and Australia 

The success of the product is a happy accident - the business makes a Christmas card every year to send to clients and friends and this year decided to add a present to their message of seasonal cheer. 

Ollie said: 'Each year, Grey London make a Christmas card to send out to clients and other agencies.'

He continued: 'This year, the two designers Mike Kennedy and Pauline Ashford went one step further and came up with a festive gift idea to feature on our cards - Beard Baubles. It was a striking image.'

The craze isn't just a hit with humans either.

Ollie says: 'We've heard about hairy dogs wearing Beard Baubles too.'

All proceeds from the baubles go to Beardseason, an initiative to raise awareness for the fight against Melanoma that is encouraging men to grow their beard during the month of December.
