Alastair Cook was always going to get runs again at some stage. He is too good a player not to do that, but this was an important day for him, his mind-set and his status within the England team.

No-one would want to go through what Cook has been experiencing and the reaction of the crowd when he was out showed how much this innings meant to the cricketing public. 

He is a likeable lad who people want to do well and to play an innings like he did under huge pressure shows what a mentally tough young man he is.

VIDEO A great day for England - Cook 

But Cook’s 95 does not change anything. We all want to see England’s best batsman, the man who will go on to become their leading runscorer, making scores consistently and the issue is how they get him playing like that all the time. One innings  does not mean all his problems are solved.

England eventually have to make a decision on Cook. Getting him back to his best as a batsman is still more important to the team than his captaincy. 

He went past Kevin Pietersen and David Gower on Sunday and he will go past Graham Gooch and many other stars of the world game as long as his batting returns to its best. That means more to England than his leadership.

He can get runs while he’s captain but it’s how England get the most out of him and in the back of Cook’s mind would have been the feeling he was not contributing, which is horrible for a captain.

Focus: Cook was given a couple of chances, but fought hard for his 95 runs

Relief: Cook won the toss and decided to bat first on a greenish looking pitch in Southampton

All the reassurances from your team-mates do not mean anything if you believe you are not pulling your weight, especially when England are in such desperate need of a victory.

Cook’s technical problems were still evident at times at the Ageas Bowl and the issue is how we ensure his mind is crystal clear, as it was on Sunday, while he works out the best way to score lots of runs.

He was trying to get much further forward and that is not easy for Alastair who has always been a back-foot player. He cannot suddenly start playing like Matty Hayden and it will  take a lot of physical and mental effort to correct this weakness, which  has been exploited by bowlers.

On his way: The England captain trudges off after falling five runs short of a century

He had a bit of luck but he deserved that after all the previous bad luck. Things even themselves out and good things  happen to good people. 

It would have been lovely if he had scored a century but he must think about his 95 and how he would have felt had he been caught by Ravindra Jadeja for 15.

Now he has to keep on working to become the Cook we know and respect because there were only glimpses of it on Sunday. He needs to develop this different way of batting. It’s a work in progress. 

What this innings does is buy him time and clears the bees in his head. Cook’s brain will not be as scrambled the next time he bats.
