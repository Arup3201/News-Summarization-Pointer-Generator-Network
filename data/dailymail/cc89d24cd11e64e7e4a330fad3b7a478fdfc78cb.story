Tony Abbott's leadership deepened overnight when Queensland voters delivered the conservative government a massive blow in the state election.

While counting in the election is still underway, the double digit swing to Labor shocked political observers and many members of the government.

Federal government MP's reportedly described the loss as 'catastrophic' and 'unimaginable', with some insisting that Tony Abbott cannot recover from the events of the day.

'All we are talking about now is the timing and method of execution,' one Queensland MP told The ABC.

During the live broadcast for Queensland's election panel, Liberal MP Jane Prentice declared that the NLP was in significant trouble.

Ms Prentice said that the party 'can't continue as we are', and pointed to the failing of the Prime Minister to 'take the people' along with the movements of the party.

'Tony has said he has listened and learned. He is making a keynote speech on Monday at the Press Club, but we can't continue as we are,' she said.

'I think that's the lesson from today.'

Ms Prentice told The ABC that 'there's a lot of strong messages for the Federal Government out of today's results.' 

At one point during the election, a swing against the LNP of 16.8% was reported by the Galaxy exit poll of 17 electorates. 

In another blow for Tony Abbott, a Galaxy poll on Saturday revealed that if an election was to be held immediately, Mr Abbott would lead the Liberal Party to a resounding loss.

The poll indicated that the Liberal party would win just 36% of the primary vote and that in the two-party preferred vote the Abbott Government has plunged to 57:43, reported The Courier Mail.

The final opinion polls suggest there will be a swing to Labor of 8-12 per cent (led by Labor leader Annastacia Palaszczuk) on Saturday, meaning the opposition could pick up between 15-30 seats

In the wake of the Queensland vote, which saw Premier Campbell Newman conceede his seat of Ashgrove to Labor candidate Kate Jones after two years, the leadership of the Liberal National Party is in question, with Treasurer Tim Nicholls a potential.

'Mr Newman's loss means that there's going to be a lot of work to be done between now and the time of that decision being made by me or anyone,' Mr Nicholls said. 

Mr Nicholls also said that the campaign against Mr Newman was heavily tied to Mr Abbott and the Federal Government.

Following leadership troubles for Tony Abbott, the Prime Minister steered clear of the Queensland campaign amid fears his presence would be a detriment to the campaign.  

Nine's political commentator Laurie Oakes said that the change in government could mean that the Prime Minister was 'dead meat'.

'The bottom line is even though Tony Abbott wasn't here, he was here in presence,' said Mr Oakes.

The Prime Minister's leadership has been the subject of increasing speculation following a series of unpopular decisions capped by the controversy over his decision to knight  Prince Phillip.

Amid backbencher disquiet Foreign Minister Julie Bishop, Communications Minister Malcolm Turnbull, Scott Morrison and former Howard government cabinet minister Mal Brough have emerged as potential candidates to take over as leader of the Liberal party.

The latest sign of pressure on Mr Abbott is an expected announcement on Monday watering down his signature policy, the controversial Paid Parental Leave scheme, which has received significant criticism for being to expensive. 

Reports have emerged that Mal Brough has been approached to pave the way for Liberal party leadership contenders, rumours which Mr Brough did not deny.

A challenge by Mr Brough is seen by some within the Liberal Party as an effective way to highlight dissatisfaction with Mr Abbott and push leadership change to the front of business. 

'Clearly people are talking to each other because we are all interested in doing what's best for the nation,' Mr Brough told Fairfax Media. 

In Queensland the final election result was not expected to be confirmed until later Sunday, but the result in Mr Newman's seat of Ashgrove was clear.

Mr Newman said that while the election was too close to call, the verdict had spelled an end for him.

'My political career is over,' Mr Newman said.  

He reflected on his time in office, saying that the 'times we’re living in are uncertain'.

'Over the last three years we’ve had to make some difficult decisions for the state, and I do believe they have put Queensland in a far better place,' reported Nine News.

Treasurer Tim Nicholls told The ABC that Mr Newman had called Ms Jones to concede his seat. 

'I think he does accept the will of the people of Ashgrove and I think that is a sign of great maturity,' said Mr Nicholls.

Mr Newman won the seat from Labor's Ms Jones at the 2012 election. 

Ms Jones said that she had been prompted to run for the seat by her electorate, as she was living in a Queensland that she 'did not want to live in'.   

Experts tipped that the polls would be a tight contest that would hand the Liberal National Party a second term. 

A Labor victory at this election was considered unthinkable in 2012, when Labor was reduced to just seven seats in the 89-seat parliament.

The LNP's Education Minister John-Paul Langbroek expressed deep concern about the exit poll and the prospect of his government being a one-term wonder.

'I'm not going to gild the lily,' he told Nine, just under an hour before voting booths closed.

'You'd be a fool to ignore it with 50 minutes to go.'

Former Labor premier Peter Beattie told the Nine election panel if the exit polls translated across the state, it would be a "boilover result" for Labor led by Annastacia Palaszczuk.

"These figures are extraordinary but I want to see the real thing," Mr Beattie said.

Labor needs a swing of just over 12 per cent to reclaim power, something the ABC's political analyst Antony Green has said would be a stunning result.

'It would be by far the biggest turnaround ever in Australian political history if the Labor party won this election,' Mr Green said this week. 

Even in a worst-case scenario, the LNP will likely hold on to around 47 seats and have the right to form government.

If that were the final outcome it would spark a mad scramble after both major parties ruled out deals with minor rivals.

There will be a particular focus on Premier Campbell Newman's seat of Ashgrove, where he's been trailing Labor's Kate Jones.

Both parties say that the seat is too close to call, but if Mr Newman loses Queensland will soon have a new premier.

The latest ReachTel poll, released on Friday, highlighted the growing discontent with Mr Newman with 35.7 per cent of respondents labelling his performance as very poor and 16.7 per cent as poor.

The other bellwether seats to watch will be are Townsville, Cairns, Mackay and Gladstone, which have been visited numerous times by both Mr Newman and Opposition Leader Annastacia Palaszczuk.

The latest Newspoll also shows the Liberal National Party is set to return to government in Queensland with a much-reduced majority after a likely 11-point swing to Labor.

The poll, published by News Corp just before Saturday's state election, shows the LNP on 52 per cent to Labor's 48 per cent on a two-party preferred basis.

The poll, taken in the final week of the campaign, gives the LNP a primary vote of 41 per cent, ahead of Labor on 37 per cent.

The poll shows only 35 per cent of voters are satisfied with Campbell Newman's performance as premier, with 58 per cent dissatisfied.

Labor leader Annastacia Palaszczuk's satisfaction levels have remained steady at 38 per cent, with 40 per cent of voters dissatisfied with her performance.

But on the question of preferred premier, Mr Newman leads his rival 43 per cent to 42 per cent. 

About 2.5 million Queenslanders are expected to lodge their vote in Saturday's state election.

The Electoral Commission of Queensland says 328,601 people have already voted in pre-polling.

Voting is compulsory and polling booths close at 6pm.
