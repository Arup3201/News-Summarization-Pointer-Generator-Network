Manuel Pellegrini insists Stevan Jovetic still has a future at Manchester City despite axing the Montenegro star from his Champions League squad.

Jovetic is said to be devastated after he was sacrificed to make room for new £28million signing Wilfried Bony. City are restricted to only 16 ‘foreign’ players in their European squad as punishment for breaching Financial Fair Play regulations.

Pellegrini said: ‘It is always difficult to take a player out of the list but we have restrictions this year. We brought Bony because I think that we need another striker, a box player, and in the position of Jovetic maybe we have some other options. It is a difficult decision but I think it was the best for the squad.’

Jovetic has struggled to hold down a first-team place at the Etihad since joining from Fiorentina for £22m in the summer of 2013. City turned down a loan offer from Juventus during the January transfer window but it is understood that the Premier League champions would have considered selling the 25-year-old if they could have recouped their money.

Pellegrini confirmed that the player’s situation would be assessed in the summer but does not think that his exclusion from the Champions League squad means that he will definitely leave the Etihad.

‘No, I don’t think that one thing has a link with the other thing,’ said the City boss. ‘It is very important for Stevan to try to play now until the end of the season to play as much games as he can and not be injured and try to have a high performance every time he plays. After the end of the season, we analyse not only for Stevan, for all the squad which will continue the next year.

‘He will be a positive player. He continues being very important player. if we didn’t have the restrictions we’d have another place. He’s a good professional and I’m sure we’ll see him playing in the Premier League.

‘He will be a positive player. For him, it is more important for him not to play all the games but to play as well as he can in the games he plays.’

City trail leaders Chelsea by five points following their draw at Stamford Bridge last weekend ahead of Saturday’s game at home to Hull City.

Pellegrini, who confirmed that both Samir Nasri and Eliaquim Mangala are fit after injury, acknowledged that his team did not play well in January but believes they remain within striking distance of the title.

He added: ‘When you have to play 45 points more, you can close the gap, of course you can do it. But is important for our team to try and be near the top of the table as soon as you can, and the only thing you can do is to improve your performance, to repeat what we did in December and wait until Chelsea drop points.

Martin Demichelis was wrapped up warm as he picked up his boots from the plentiful boot room 

‘The last two times this team won the title was coming from behind so I suppose we can do it for a third time.

‘January was not a good month. We changed again our style of play. We had to arrange our team without strikers. We arrange it. After that the strikers came back and they have to have to have minutes again. The Chelsea game will be a switch of performance because we played a very good game playing away against the best team of the Premier League. I am sure we will see the team again we are normally used to seeing.

‘I am sure that playing as we did against Chelsea and recovering the goals we score at home, we are going to be an important team from now until the end.’
