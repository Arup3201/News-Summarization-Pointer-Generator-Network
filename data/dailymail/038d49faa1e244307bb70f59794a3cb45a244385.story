Terrorists today said they planned to execute a French spy who has been held captive in Somalia for years - and who French authorities believe is already dead.

Al-Shabaab, a Somali-based group linked to al-Qaeda, said on Twitter that France 'signed his death warrant' by attempting to launch a rescue operation over the weekend.

The bid to rescue the agent, codenamed Denis Allex, failed dramatically and two French commandos were killed in the operation.

Dead: Terrorists announced they have executed French spy Denis Allex following a botched rescue mission

 what they says is a soldier killed in attempt to free a French 
intelligence officer held hostage

In its statement today, al-Shabaab claimed that Allex, who was kidnapped in July 2009, is alive and had been in another safe house that was not targeted by the French rescue force.

And it said the group had 'reached a unanimous decision' on the man's fate this weekend.

The planned execution is also to avenge what al-Shabaab called France's 'persecution' of Muslims at home and around the world - including in Mali, north Africa, where French troops today launched an assault on rebels.

French troops today launched the 
country's first ground operation in a bid to dislodge the fighters who 
have resisted six days of air strikes.

France
 called for international support against Islamist insurgents it says 
are a threat to Africa and the West and acknowledged it faced a long 
fight against well-equipped and determined militant fighters who seized 
Mali's vast desert north last year.

Earlier,
 Edouard Guillaud, the French chief of military staff, said up to 2,500 
of his troops would soon have been deployed, together with tanks and 
artillery pieces.

It comes as British transport planes 
which have landed in the west African country continue to resupply the 
growing military presence in the west African country.

Thirteen nations, most notably Nigeria, have agreed to send troops or supplies and logistical help.

Islamist groups and secular Tuareg 
rebels took advantage of the chaos that followed a military coup to 
seize northern Mali in April 2012.

They
 have imposed a brutal version of Islam, with girls as young as 12 being
 flogged for not covering up, along with pregnant and elderly women.

All music and even mobile phone ringtones have been banned.It comes only two days after Somali militants posted sickening photographs of what they claim is a 
French soldier killed in Saturday's failed rescue mission.

Three
 pictures posted on Twitter show a white man wearing military pants and a
 blood-soaked shirt surrounded by three guns, ammunition clips and 
protective gear.

Militant 
Islamist group al-Shabab taunt the dead man's religion in their posts 
writing 'A return of the crusades, but the cross could not save him from
 the sword,’ and asking president Francois Hollande if it was 'worth 
it'.

Denis Allex, the pseudonym for a secret 
agent who was captured in the east African country in 2009 while working
 for France’s overseas intelligence agency DGSE. He had been training soldiers before he was captured.

Mr Allex has appeared in propaganda 
videos since he was seized, pleading for his release and for France to 
drop its support for the Somali government.

His
 first appeal in 2010, a year after he was captured, saw him call on 
then-President Nicolas Sarkozy to drop his backing for the former colony.

Then,
 in July 2012, looking gaunt, he sent a video message to new President 
Francois Hollande, telling how his hopes of a rescue were fading by the 
day.

He calls on France to drop its 'oppressive attitude' towards Muslims and says Mr Hollande represented his last hope of rescue.
  
  Poignantly, he adds: 'I am alive. But for how long?'

French authorities believe he is now dead after the botched raid this weekend by French commandos.

French special forces arrived in the village of Bulo Marer, 50 miles from the capital Mogadishu, in the early hours of Saturday, 12 January.

Their mission was to free the agent but  within minutes of arriving, the commandos were involved in a firefight that saw a soldier killed.

Up to 17 Somalis were killed in scenes reminiscent of the battle of Mogadishu in 1993, which is commonly referred to as Black Hawk Down  after a book and film about the incident.

Then, a US army force  tried to seize Somali warlords in the city but two UH-60 Black Hawk helicopters  were shot down, resulting  in the deaths and wounding of 18 Americans, and up to  3,000 Somalis.

Those involved in the attack were members of militant  Islamist group Al-Shabab,  the Somalian representatives of Al Qaeda.

French defence minister Jean-Yves Le Drian said: ‘A French commando was killed and another is missing.’

Despite earlier French claims about Mr Allex being killed, Al-Shabab insisted he was still alive – and had not even been in the village.

In a statement, the group said it had ‘killed several’ French soldiers and that Mr Allex was ‘safe and far from the location of the battle’.

The failed raid came just a few hours 
after France began a military operation in Mali to assist the government
 there against encroaching rebels apparently linked to Al Qaeda.

It was formed as a radical offshoot of the Union of Islamic Courts in 2006.

Affiliated to al-Qaeda, it controls large swathes of south and central Somalia and in 2010 it was responsible for the deaths of 76 people in a double attack in Uganda during 2010 football World Cup.

It is estimated to have 7,000 to 9,000 fighters. al-Shabab means 'The Youth' in Arabic.

This followed fears that Mr 
Allex would be executed in an act of revenge.

David Cameron has expressed his 
‘deep concern’ about the situation in Mali which today was cited as the trigger for an attack on a BP oil field that left at least on British expat dead.

President Francois 
Hollande says France will raise its domestic terror threat level in 
light of events in Mali and Somalia.
