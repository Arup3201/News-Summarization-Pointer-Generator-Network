Nissan announced on Saturday that it is recalling more than 52,000 vehicles for passenger air bags that can explode with too much force and send shards of metal into the passenger compartment.

The vehicles have air bag systems made by troubled Japanese supplier Takata Corp. The Nissan recalls are among nearly 8 million others made by 10 automakers, mainly in Southern high-humidity states, over the Takata air bags.

The recall affects the Infiniti FX35 and FX45 from 2003 to 2005, Infiniti I35 from 2003 and 2004 and Infiniti M35 and M45 from 2006. Also affected are Nissan Pathfinders from 2003 and 2004 and Nissan Sentras from 2004 to 2006.

In total, 52,738 vehicles are involved.

The newly recalled vehicles were sold or registered in 12 high-humidity states and territories. The humidity can cause the air bag propellant to burn too fast and potentially blow apart the metal canisters. The problem has been linked to four deaths.

Affected states and territories include Alabama, Florida, Georgia, Hawaii, Louisiana, Mississippi and Texas and the territories of Puerto Rico, the U.S. Virgin Islands, Saipan, Guam and American Samoa.

Takata controls about 22 percent of the global air bag market. The U.S. National Highway Traffic Safety Administration is investigating whether Takata and automakers that use its air bags acted quickly enough once the defects were suspected.

Nissan announced a small recall of two Infiniti models late last month also tied to Takata-made air bags. That recall affected some 1,800 Infiniti QX56 SUVs from 2013 and the Infiniti QX80 from 2014.

The Tokyo-based Nissan Motor Co. says it will notify owners and replace the air bag inflator for free.
