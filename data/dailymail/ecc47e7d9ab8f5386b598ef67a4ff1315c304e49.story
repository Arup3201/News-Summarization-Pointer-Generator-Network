If these photographs of Prince Harry posing with glamorous girls strikes you as a little less discreet than usual, rest assured that the prince isn't quite himself in the pictures. In fact, he's made entirely of wax.

The royal waxwork has been unveiled by London's Madame Tussauds to celebrate the prince's upcoming thirtieth birthday. Looking like a royal Rambo in his army fatigues, the new Harry replaces his 2006 model, who has been wearing a traditional blue suit since the age of 22.

The figure cost £150,000 to create and a dedicated team of sculptors and
 hair and colour artists worked for four months to achieve the amazingly
 accurate likeness.

A new waxwork of Prince Harry has been unveiled at Madame Tussauds to celebrate the prince's thirtieth birthday

The new-look Harry is more reflective of the much-loved Prince's recent career as an 
Apache Helicopter Pilot and his status as Captain Harry Wales of 3 
Regiment Army Air Corps.

Donated by the Army Air Corps, the figure’s new
 outfit is comprised of a pilot’s fire retardant, multi-terrain, pattern
 field jacket – featuring Prince Harry’s former tactical recognition 
flash - and trousers with plain green field belt, plus khaki tee-shirt 
and desert boots.

The new Prince Harry will be on display in the Royal area at Madame Tussauds London, 
where it will be in the familiar company of the prince’s father and 
stepmother, The Prince of Wales and Duchess of Cornwall, as well as The 
Duke and Duchess of Cambridge, Her Majesty the Queen and The Duke of 
Edinburgh.

'Our
 Royal figures are amongst the most popular here at Madame Tussauds 
London,' commented a Madame Tussauds' spokesperson. 'Since he was first 
portrayed in his very early twenties Prince Harry has changed quite a 
lot, and his thirtieth birthday seemed the perfect time to create a 
brand new figure with a brand new look.

'We
 know our guests will be delighted to get up close to the prince, 
dressed as he has so often been pictured, in his fatigues, relaxed, 
informal and very much at ease.'

Madame 
Tussauds London has always been hospitable to the Royal Family, dating 
back to the William IV waxwork who lived at the museum when the it first
 opened in 1835.

Her Majesty the Queen has been modelled over 20 times and has given the studio team six personal sittings over the years.
