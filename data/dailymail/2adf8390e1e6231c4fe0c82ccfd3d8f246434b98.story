A Spanish pilot was killed today when his Eurofighter jet smashed into the ground as it came in to land.

It is not yet clear why the jet crashed just next to the runway of the Moron de la Frontera airbase, near Seville, at 2pm this afternoon.

The 30-year-old pilot, who was from Madrid, had logged 600 hours of experience flying the combat jet.

Tragic: The scene where a pilot of a Eurofighter combat jet fatally crashed his fighter just short of the runway at Spanish air force base Moron de la Frontera near Seville, Andalusia, Spain earlier today

The accident was the third involving a Eurofighter in Spain in just under a decade, Spanish media reported.

A Saudi national died in a Eurofighter crash in 2010, also at the Moron base, just after taking off during a training flight with a Spanish co-pilot, who was injured.

There was also a previous accident with a Eurofighter prototype at another base in Spain, with no casualties, according to local media.

Eurofighters are built by British defence company BAE Systems, European aerospace group Airbus and Italy's Finmeccanica.

The RAF currently operates 95 Eurofighters, known in the service as Typhoons, across five squadrons. They make up part of the permanent garrison on the Falklands as well as operating out of two bases on the UK mainland.

While the RAF's Typhoon fleet was temporarily grounded following the 2010 crash at Moron de la Frontera, there have been no accidents involving the UK pilots save for one incident in the U.S. in 2008 when one crash landed after, it was suspected, its pilot forgot to lower his landing gear.

Spain agreed to acquire 87 Eurofighters just over a decade ago, and has an option to buy 16 more between 2003 and 2018, according to the Defence Ministry.

Makers of the Eurofighter have faced tough competition for overseas jet orders from manufacturers of rival models such as Boeing and Lockheed Martin of the U.S. and Saab of Sweden.
