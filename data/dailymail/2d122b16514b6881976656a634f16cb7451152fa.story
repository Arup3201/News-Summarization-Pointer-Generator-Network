Ann Mara, the matriarch of the NFL's New York Giants for the past 60 years, has died. She was 85.

Giants co-owner John Mara announced his mother's death on Super Bowl Sunday.

Ann Mara slipped in front of her home in Rye, New York, during an ice storm two weeks ago and was hospitalized with a head injury the following day.

John Mara says that while there were initial hopes for recovery, complications developed and she died early on Sunday.

'I am sad to say that our mother has passed away,' said John Mara in a statement Sunday. 'She has been the leader of our family in every way, and we will miss her dearly. She loved her family, and all of us were able to spend time with her in these final days

'All 11 of her children and our spouses and numerous grandchildren were with her when she passed away.'

Among the matriarch's 43 grandchildren are actresses Rooney Mara--best known for her role as Lisbeth Salander in the Girl With the Dragon Tattoo--and Kate Mara, who starred in Netflix series House of Cards.

While they are the descendants of Giants founders on their father's side, Kate and Rooney's mother's family founded the Pittsburgh Steelers. 

It took until 2012 for their octogenarian matriarch to gain her own sort of pop cultural fame.

In February of that year, Mara gained widespread notoriety for a confrontation she had with NFL great turned football commentator Terry Bradshaw. 

After her Giants defeated the 49's to clench the NFC title, Mara approached Bradshaw and cried loudly 'You never pick the Giants!' over her son--president and CEO of the Giants, John Mara--protested and cameras rolled.

In a statement obtained by the New York Daily News, NFL commissioner Roger Goodell said: 

'Mrs. Mara was a tower of strength, dignity and inspiration for her family and all of us in the NFL.

'Her family and the Giants organization have always reflected Mrs. Mara's competitive spirit, integrity and wonderful sense of humor.'

Ann Mara and her children owned 50 percent of the Giants, one of the founding families of the league, since the death of her husband, Wellington, in 2005. While she was not active in daily operations, her opinion was valued greatly.
