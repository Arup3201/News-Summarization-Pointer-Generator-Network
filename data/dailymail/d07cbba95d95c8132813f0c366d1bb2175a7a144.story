Children's laureate Malorie Blackman has revealed she harboured anger towards white people for years after being sexually assaulted aged 13

Malorie Blackman, the best-selling author and Children’s Laureate, was sexually assaulted in a cinema when she was just 13 years old, she has revealed.

The writer, whose Noughts And Crosses novels explore racial tensions, said her ordeal at the hands of three white men meant she hated white people for much of her life as a teenager.

Interviewed for today’s edition of Desert Island Discs, the 51-year-old author recalled: ‘I was 12 or 13 at the time. I used to go to the cinema a lot by myself and I was watching Disney’s Robin Hood. Three white guys came up behind me.

‘Two of them grabbed my arms so I couldn’t move and the other one sexually assaulted me.‘I was so traumatised. They were laughing and thought it was a big joke. I managed to get away and ran away in floods of tears.’

Blackman, who also wrote the acclaimed 1997 novel Pig Heart Boy, said the attack contributed to her being a very angry teenager.

She described her attackers as ‘horrible’ and said that after the incident she felt ‘all white people were horrible’. Her love for a particular song eventually helped her break out of the cycle of hate.She said: ‘The thing that brought it home to me was a song I really loved called What You Won’t Do For Love, by Bobby Caldwell.

‘I went into a record shop and I found one of his albums and he was  a blonde guy. I remember thinking, ‘‘Oh my God, he’s white.’’ 

‘And then I thought, ‘‘Are you really going to stop liking this song because this guy is white?’’ That’s when I caught myself and thought no, this is silly.’

Blackman, whose song choices on today’s programme include Bob Marley’s Redemption Song and Right Said Fred by Bernard Cribbins, also recalled how a racist careers teacher refused to write her a reference for university and blocked her dream of becoming an English teacher.

Blackman said: ‘She just looked me in the eye and said, ‘‘Black people don’t become English teachers. Why don’t you be a secretary instead?’’

‘For about three or four years I wasted my life hating her because  I thought she had ruined my life. If I met her again, I would thank her because she did me a favour. She taught me if that someone stands in the way of what you really want to do, you don’t stand there arguing with them and you certainly don’t let them stop you. What you do is find a way to go around them.’Desert Island Discs is on  BBC Radio 4 today at 11.15am.
