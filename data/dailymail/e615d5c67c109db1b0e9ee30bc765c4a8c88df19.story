For a price that could get you a  two-bedroom semi-detached house in Sidcup or a three-bedder in Brighton, you could own your own private Caribbean island.

The 10,893-square-foot Isla Paloma, on the northern side of the Central American nation of Panama, is listed for sale for US$400,000 (£266,000) by Private Islands Online.

Tranquility is the main selling point for the small island in the still waters of the Bocas Del Toro region, between Almirante Bay and Chiriqui Lagoon.

The next resident of the property won’t be lonely though, with a range of bird life inhabiting the island, including the purple dove which gives the island its name along with some geckos.

The listing agent also proclaims there are ‘no snakes or spiders, and no mammals’ so the island is ‘pet friendly’.

Tides are no problem with the shallow fluctuation of just 12-17 inches, while a circle of mangroves around the island protect it from erosion.

‘Beautiful view of the mountain range and spectacular sunrises and sunsets’ are additional advantages.

The house has two bedrooms, with a loft that could be used for storage or a third bedroom

The upper deck is the perfect place to relax on the range of furniture, all included in the sale
