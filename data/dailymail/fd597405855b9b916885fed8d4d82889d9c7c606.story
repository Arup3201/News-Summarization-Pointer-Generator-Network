Shocking footage showing the moment a man was thrown from the bonnet of a moving car in a hit-and-run attack has been released by police in a bid to catch the culprit.

The 24-year-old male victim is struck with enough force he bounces into the car’s windscreen before being carried along on the bonnet for several more yards.

As the car stops, the victim is flung off into the road, but manages to struggle to his feet before limping away, with passers-by running to the man’s aid.

The car, thought to be a Seat Leon, was then driven off and has yet to be traced.

The
 incident which happened in Radnor Road in Luton at 11pm on 12 June is being treated as attempted murder by detectives.

Police
 say they are 'potentially linking' it to another crime, also being 
investigated as an attempted murder, which happened in the town two 
weeks previously when another man was shot in the back with a pellet 
gun.

Detective Chief Inspector Jason Gordon of Bedfordshire, Cambridgeshire and Hertfordshire Major Crime Unit, said: 'The victims in both these incidents are lucky to be alive.

'They both narrowly escaped very serious injury and it is clear the offenders on both occasions meant to cause serious harm.'

In the 
shooting an 18-year-old man was walking with friends along Addington Way
 when two masked assailants struck at about 1.30am on 25 May.

He manages to struggle to his feet before limping away, with passers-by running to the man's aid

In
 a direct appeal, Mr Gordon said people living in the area held the key 
to the attackers’ identities and he urged them to come forward.

'We are re-appealing for the public’s help again as the CCTV could potentially unlock these investigations,' he said.

'There are clear links between the two incidents, even though they happened two weeks apart.

'There will be people living in the community who know who is responsible and now they are being treated as attempt murder will I hope make people realise this is serious and come forward.'
