This is the emotional moment a British soldier who survived the worst ever battlefield injuries while serving in Afghanistan collected his MBE from Prince Charles at Buckingham Palace.

Lance Bombardier Ben Parkinson lost both legs and suffered more than 40 
injuries, including brain damage which affected his memory and speech, 
in a bomb attack in 2006.

The paratrooper has since defied medical opinion by teaching himself to walk again for short distances using crutches.

And his determination was exemplified today as was he able to proudly stand to receive his honour.

In a poignant moment, the Prince of Wales touched his shoulder as he leaned towards L/Bdr Parkinson and told him he was an 'inspiration'.

Speaking moments afterwards, L/Bdr Parkinson said: 'I was surprised at how much Prince Charles knew about me.

'He said I was an inspiration. It made me feel so proud.'

When he took a turn in carrying the Olympic flame through his hometown of Doncaster, South Yorkshire, last July, the sight of the determined soldier on his prosthetic legs moved many to tears and was declared one of the most emotional scenes of the relay. 

L/Bdr Parkinson was unconscious in a military hospital for three months before he came round following the Taliban attack seven years ago.

Since then he has had to learn to walk again on prosthetic legs, undergo major surgery to fix his shattered spine and teach himself to talk once more.

Not content with battling back from his horrific injuries, L/Bdr Parkinson was one of a group of injured veterans who took part in a gruelling trek in Norway earlier this year.

The expedition, organised by the charity Pilgrim Bandits, retraced the footsteps of the Second World War heroes of Telemark to mark the 70th anniversary of the mission.

Along with other amputees and severely 
injured servicemen, L/Bdr Parkinson travelled 65 miles (105km) across 
the Hardangervidda in winds of up to 80mph (129kph) and temperatures of 
minus 30C (minus 22F).

L/Bdr Parkinson suffered a brain injury, fractures to his skull, 
cheek, nose, jaw and pelvis, fractured vertebrae, and serious damage to 
his spleen and chest when his Land Rover was hit.

His mother Diane Parkinson 
successfully fought the MoD to have his original compensation of 
£152,150 - just over half the maximum £285,000 - increased to £540,000.

Also recognised for bravery today was Royal Navy pilot Lieutenant Commander Craig Sweeney, who received the Air Force Cross for leading the rescue of a climber in Argyll in blizzard conditions, plummeting temperatures and pitch darkness.

He described the mission to uplift Gareth Bradley on 3,074ft (937m) Beinn Sgulaird near Oban as one of the most challenging rescues he has ever undertaken.

'We didn’t have any time to reflect on what we were doing at the time. I was completely in focus, just concentrating on the job in hand,' he said.

'I find this more nerve-wracking,' he joked.

The crew from HMS Gannet in Prestwick, Ayrshire, flew their Sea King helicopter to the aid of Mr Bradley, who had a broken ankle and might not have survived the elements were it not for their rescue mission on December 18 2011.

Lt Cmdr Sweeney, 38, joined HMS Gannet in December 2010 and lives close to the unit in Alloway with his wife and three children.

Speaking of being honoured, he said: 'This is completely overwhelming.

'It’s very humbling, really. I didn’t expect to receive it and there were three other crew members involved, I hasten to add.

'Prince Charles said he was astounded by the bravery we’d shown and he said he was going to ask his eldest son if he knew about the rescue but said he hadn’t managed to yet.'

Former world number one golfer Luke Donald said it was an 'amazing experience' to be made an MBE for services to the sport.

'Everyone wants to go through that,' he said.

'It’s a great honour to be recognised. It means a lot, I always try my hardest and to be the best I can and it’s great to get that recognised.'

Donald, who said his next goal was to win one of the majors, said of meeting Charles: 'He was surprised that I got the time off to practise and he said he thought it was amazing that us golfers practise and play in all sorts of tough conditions.

'He said he hoped the medal would inspire me as I compete in the future.'

Donald is from Hemel Hempstead, Hertfordshire, but lives in the US where he splits his time between Chicago and Florida with his wife Diane and their two young daughters.

He flew over yesterday and said it was 'great' to be back in the UK where he will also compete at the BMW PGA Championship at Wentworth in Surrey next week.

'Obviously a ceremony like this reminds you of your heritage and Britishness,' he said.
