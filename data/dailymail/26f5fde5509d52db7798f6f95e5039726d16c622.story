Meet the gentleman with what is widely considered the world's most unfortunate name - Guilherme Carabagiale F**k.

The Brazilian student has the unusual last name - which he insists is actually pronounced 'Foo-kee' - thanks to his German heritage.

The talented sportsman insists he isn't ashamed of his name - but admits that he find it easier to be identified by his other surname of Carabagiale when playing college basketball in Canada.

Mr F**k, a student at Medicine Hat College in Alberta, said: 'It doesn't mean what people think it means. In German it means "fox".

'When they asked my opinion, I said I want to have my last-last name - I'm not ashamed of it.

'I would rather always use my last-last name. Back in Brazil that's what I use, I don't use my first-last name. '

Mr F**k is one of the star players for the college's Rattlers basketball team, who compete in the Canadian Collegiate Athletic Association's national basketball championships.

The team coach Craig Price praised his player and said the whole team was proud to be supporting of him, whatever name he chooses to be called by, 

Talented: Mr F**k, a student at Medicine Hat College in Alberta, said: 'It doesn't mean what people think it means. In German it means "fox"'

He said: 'In a lot of ways, at the beginning we were just going to avoid any confusion or any potential issues, whereas now we're at the point of, this is the guy's name - he's an all-Canadian.' 

Mr Price added: 'We shouldn't be avoiding it, he's proud of being a Rattler and we want to support him.

'He takes great pride in his heritage, in where he comes front, and technically in what his name is.' 

But Mr F**k, who is 6ft 6ins tall, does avoid the issue on social media by spelling his surname as 'Fuki'.
