Premier League clubs have unanimously passed new legislation designed to improve pathways and opportunities for black and minority ethic employment in football.

Clubs signed up on Thursday to a package of new equality measures which will make enhanced training and recruitment processes mandatory rather than voluntary at all levels.

They will also guarantee to ensure that in future at least a quarter of the intake on the Premier League’s top coaching course, the Elite Coaching Apprenticeship Scheme (ECAS), will be black and minority ethnic.

This year’s intake of 20 ECAS coaches included three black and ethnic minority (BME) coaches and was boosted by another three to ensure the percentage was met, and it will be maintained in future, with a pledge to help those coaches into a network which will guarantee them job at top-level clubs.

The changes stop some way short of the Rooney Rule, introduced in the NFL which demands one BME candidate on every job opportunity short list. It has been credited with increasing the number of black and ethnic minority coaches in the game.

But the Premier League has set the momentum rolling by changing its legislation.

In practice, the opportunities with the ECAS programme will have an impact because this is an integral coach education element of the Elite Player Performance Plan (EPPP).

ECAS, in it's second year, involves one coach, hand picked by each of the 22 clubs with Category One academy status.

They are then immersed in a programme which includes visits to elite training environments like British Cycling, Athletic Bilbao, the University of Bath and the Royal Shakespeare Company. They will also visit the SAS and McLaren F1 team.
