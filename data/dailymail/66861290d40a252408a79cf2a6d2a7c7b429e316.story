The judge who heads the secretive Court of Protection called yesterday for its hearings to be thrown open to the Press.

Mr Justice Charles told peers that open scrutiny of the controversial court’s hearings would improve the behaviour of everyone taking part, including judges.

He brushed aside arguments that the Court of Protection – which makes decisions about the medical treatment, care and property of those who cannot decide for themselves – has a first duty to protect the privacy of families and individuals who come before it.

The Court of Protection is part of the High Court and analyses issues relating to sick and vulnerable people

‘The impact of proceedings having more sunlight let in, more transparency, outweighs the difficulties that in some cases some people may have in having their privacy invaded,’ the judge said.

He also told peers the court’s routine secrecy may break human rights laws, that judges have been reluctant even to let the public know the outcome of the court’s cases, and that some judges and legal figures remain firmly opposed to letting outsiders know what goes on in its hearings.

The call for open reporting of cases follows months of growing controversy.

Set up six years ago under Labour’s Mental Capacity Act, the court can order people to be confined to care homes or decide whether desperately sick patients should die or be treated.

One doctor told the court that the woman's physical and mental problems should lessen, and be easier to treat, once the baby was born

In April, the Daily Mail revealed that a Court of Protection judge had sent Wanda Maddocks, 50, to jail in secret. Miss Maddocks was sentenced to five months for defying the court by trying to free her father from a care home where she thought his life was in danger.

Sir James Munby, head of the family courts, has repeatedly called for more openness.

Mr Justice Charles yesterday threw his weight behind Sir James at the Lords inquiry into the Mental Capacity Act’s workings. Greater openness would ‘improve the performance of all involved in the court process’, he told peers. ‘I don’t exclude judges from that.’
