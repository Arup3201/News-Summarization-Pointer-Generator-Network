A 'mini tornado' caused the skydiving accident that killed a New York City corrections officer and critically injured his instructor during a tandem jump on Wednesday, according to safety experts.

Gary Messina, 25, died and instructor Christopher Scott, 28, was injured after plummeting to the ground when their parachute failed to open at Long Island Skydive in Calverton about 4pm.

Messina, a father of one son, died a day before his birthday.

United States Parachute Association director Rich Winstock said winds of up to 15mph and dust churned into a funnel, making
it impossible to control the parachute.

Officer: Gary Messina, 25 (pictured standing, second from left) was a corrections officer at Rikers Island Correctional Facility

Scott, a skydiving instructor since March 2012, was flown to Stony Brook University Hospital in a critical but stable condition, Riverhead News Review reported.

Messina's heartbroken family described him as a 'man's man' who adored his five-year-old son, Jake.

The Rikers Island Correctional Facility correction officer went skydiving with his colleagues because he wanted a final adventure before turning 26 the next day.

'I gave him a nickname, ‘Go-Hard,’ because everything he did, he went hard, 100 percent,' his brother Anthony Messina told CBS.

Messina's mother, Patrice Messina, told the Daily News she can't bear the thought of living without her son.

'I can’t even give him a birthday card, dinner, buy him a birthday balloon. It’s just a horrible thing that happened. I wanna die, I wanna die!' she sobbed.

'He was loved by all the correction officers ... He was a wonderful man, son, child, father, boyfriend, brother uncle. He was just wonderful.'

New York City Correction Officer Benevolent Association president Norman Seabrook said the accident was an 'unfortunate tragedy', and called Messina 'a great officer with so much promise.'

The Federal Aviation Administration is investigating.
