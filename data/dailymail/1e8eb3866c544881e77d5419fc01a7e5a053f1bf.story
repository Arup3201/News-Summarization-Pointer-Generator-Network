Liverpool’s alarming collapse could cost Brendan Rodgers’ side the title after Crystal Palace exposed the Reds’ defensive frailties on Monday night.

There’s no doubt the Anfield boss will be on the lookout for replacements this summer.

Sportsmail’s SIMON JONES looks at 10 possible options for Rodgers to consider to shore-up his leaky defence.

MARCOS ROJO

Sporting LisbonAge: 24Cost £12m

Argentina defender who plays at left-back for his country but centre-back for his club. Technically good, has pace, is tough and grabs the occasional goal.

FEDERICO FAZIO

SevillaAge: 27Cost: £10m

Stylish Argentine defender with a ruthless streak. Good on the ball and 6ft 5ins tall. Has also been watched by Arsenal and Everton over recent years.

STEFAN DE VRIJ

FeyenoordAge: 22Cost: £5m

Holland international is ready to leave Feyenoord but has one year left on his  contract. Liverpool have watched him and team-mate Bruno Martins Indi.

JOEL VELTMAN

AjaxAge: 22Cost £12m

Manchester United, Tottenham and Arsenal have all watched him and Liverpool can see his potential but Ajax will make it difficult for him to leave just now.

INIGO MARTINEZ

Real SociedadAge: 22Cost: £22m

Spanish international has been watched by United, City and Barcelona but all have question marks about his ability to match the more physical opponents.

DEJAN LOVREN

SouthamptonAge: 24Cost: £12m

Move to Southampton has only served to improve his reputation. Croatia international is a good all-round defender and Premier League experience helps.

JAVI MARTINEZ

Bayern MunichAge: 25Cost: £30m

Accomplished holding midfielder who can also play at centre-back. The Spaniard is unsettled at Munich and is among players considering his future under Pep Guardiola.

STEVEN CAULKER

Cardiff CityAge: 22Cost: £8.5m

Has had an indifferent season but emerged with credit despite Cardiff’s relegation. Brendan Rodgers is a fan and age is on his side to keep improving.

MATEO MUSACCHIO

VillarrealAge: 23Cost: £25m

Not the biggest centre-back but tough and uncompromising. Has good positional sense, reads the game very well and intercepts danger frequently.

MARTIN HINTEREGGER

Red Bull SalzburgAge: 21Cost: £8m

Still a bit raw but has right physical attributes. Has also been watched by Arsenal and United. Liverpool scouts watched the Austrian in action against Uruguay in March.

AND HERE’S ONE THEY PREPARED EARLIER...LLOYD JONES

LiverpoolAge: 18

Liverpool paid compensation to Plymouth for the teenage defender who is impressing club coaches and has captained the Under 21 side. Is decent on the ball, is 6ft 3ins tall and still growing.
