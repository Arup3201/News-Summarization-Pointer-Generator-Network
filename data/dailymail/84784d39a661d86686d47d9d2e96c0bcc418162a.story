A man was in custody in Morocco today after burying alive a new girlfriend he met online and causing her death.

In a chilling example of the dangers of web dating, 25-year-old French woman Mina El Houari travelled to the North African country to see her new romance.

The man, who has not been named, had sent her his picture and the pair had exchanged numerous messages via email and social media.

The 25-year-old French woman travelled to the city of Fez in northern Morocco to meet the man she had been in contact with online

But when Miss El Houari, who came from Cadenet, in south-east France, got to his home in the city of Fez she fell seriously ill.

Not knowing she was a diabetic, the man said he 'watched her fall unconscious' and 'thinking she was dead' buried her.

In fact she was still conscious, according to police reports, but suffocated and died once covered in mounds of earth.

Mina had been staying in a five star hotel in Fez, and when she failed to contact staff, or relatives back home, the alarm was raised.

A Moroccan police spokesman said they originally found a pair of muddy trousers and a shovel at the suspect's home, but then Mia's body was uncovered.

Her parents, who are both hoteliers back in France, have now travelled out to Fez, where the man has 'confessed', said the police spokesman.

The suspect remains in custody and 'faces trial', said the spokesman added.
