A psychologist and sex therapist has spoken out about gender-neutral parenting - the act of raising a child without the traditional confines or stereotypes of gender.

Bettina Arndt has deemed the concept 'doomed for failure' in an interview set to air on Channel Seven's Sunday Night this weekend.

The psychologist - who has served on many government advisory committees - also criticised the way we as a society raise men, saying women expect too much from their male partners.

Psychologist Bettina Anrdt has spoken out against gender-neutral parenting saying it's 'doomed for failure'

'As we discovered, back in the 70s there were a lot of women who, feminists, women in the women's movement who decided they were going to try to do that sort of thing, a lot of us have realized we are really up against it because, I think there is no question there is something biological,' she told the program.

'I think it's doomed to failure.'

Ms Ardnt added that the shift away from traditional male roles in relationships means men don't have as much of a voice within the family unit and this can be damaging to them, citing the difference between the way children were brought up in the 1950s and the present.

Dare Jennings said he is committed to nurturing male behaviours and said traditional male gender roles helped men figure out where they fit in

'There was just an assumption that father’s had a voice, but I think a lot of mums are making all the decisions about how their children are raised, and I don’t know where dad’s voice has actually gone now,' the psychologist said. 

Ms Arndt also revealed she believes that women expect too much from men and they shouldn't be expected to do everything.

She said females have their expectations set too high, need to be more realistic, and shouldn't be in search of that 'soulmate'.

Father and founder of iconic Australian surf brand Mambo Dare Jennings said he is committed to nurturing male behaviours and said traditional male gender roles helped men figure out where they fit in.

He added that this attitude can lead men to apologetic for normal behaviour and forcing them to seek permission for things that they don't need it for. 

The program also features insight from a family in Britain raising their child as gender-neutral.
