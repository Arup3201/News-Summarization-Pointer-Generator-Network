A teenager's spoof version of Gangnam Style - called Norfolk Style - has become an internet sensation with more than 250,000 views in just five days on YouTube.

Wyll James, 16, changed the words of the smash hit to sing the praises of life in his home county with lyrics about driving tractors, milking cows and eating hot stew.

The sixth former filmed himself singing the parody last Thursday with his friend Mateo Jarvis, 16, who is half Filipino, performing Gangnam Style dance moves.

SCROLL DOWN FOR VIDEO

Teenager Wyll James' spoof version of Gangnam Style, called Norfolk Style, has become an internet sensation with more than 250,000 views in just five days on YouTube

The 16 year old changed the words of the smash hit to sing the praises of life in his home county with lyrics about driving tractors, milking cows and eating hot stew

Wyll wrote, recorded and edited the video during his Christmas holidays and saw it clock up more than 150,000 views on YouTube in just three days

The original Gangnam Style video shows Korean rapper Psy dancing with glamorous women and has become the most watched video on YouTube with 1.1 billion views.

But Wyll made his version, sung in a Norfolk accent, in half an hour with the help of his metal worker father Andrew, 54, in the garden of his grandmother's rural home in Bunwell, Norfolk.

While the real song repeats the words 'Hey pretty lady', Wyll - who admits the song is a tongue in cheek look at the many stereotypes given to his home county - sings 'Hey inbred lady' as a cheeky reference to a joke that East Anglia people are inbred.

The teenager pokes fun at Norfolk's love of a 'nice hot brew'

Wyll admits the song is a tongue in cheek look at the many stereotypes given to his home county - including that residents enjoy drinking cider

He swaps the words to talk of his fellow countymen's love of a 'nice hot stew'

His
song has the chorus: 'Cuttin' trees down, and drivin' tractors, that's 
what I like, that's what I like, and that's just the way I Iike to live 
my life - we got Norfolk Style.'

Sittin' on a hay bail in the middle of a fieldWaitin' for my dinner tatas (potatoes) already been peeledSittin' in my garden with a mug of nice hot brewThere is nothing better than a nice hot stew

I like welly bootsI like milking cows and sometimes even goatsI can't read or spell or even write a noteDon't go out nowhere without my old ripped coatWithout my coat

Cuttin' trees down And driving tractorsThat's what I like, that's what I like

Cuttin' trees downAnd driving tractorsThat's what I like, that's what I likeAnd that's just the way I like to live my life

We got Norfolk StyleHey Inbred lady

Walking through the farmyard with my country boys behind meWe just cleaned our landrovers and now they are so shinyWe like homemade cider but don't like the taste of wineWe get p***** and do it all the time

My favourite thing is stringGot a problem, it can fix pretty much everythingI like digging holes which i can plant things inI fix my barn roof with corrugated tinCorrugated tin

Cuttin' trees down And driving tractorsThat's what I like, that's what I like

Cuttin' trees down And driving tractorsThat's what I like, that's what I likeAnd that's just the way I like to live my life

We got Norfolk StyleHey Inbred lady

I love a great big roast and love my brussel sproutsGravy, gravy lathered on without a doubt

I'm on a hunting trip, shooting with the ladsWe like killing things, you must think we are mad

You know what I'm saying

We got Norfolk StyleHey Inbred lady

Wyll
of Norwich, uploaded it to YouTube on Friday, posting links to all his 
friends on social networking sites Facebook and Twitter and had 2,500 
views within a few hours.

The
video took off after the link to it was re-tweeted by Norwich City 
striker Grant Holt and former Norwich City and Leicester player Darren 
Eadie.

It rapidly became a hit around the world with people viewing it as far away as Australia and South Africa.

Wyll's video was trending as the most
popular music video on YouTube on Sunday and Monday and by this morning
it had been viewed 254,361 times.

His spoof is the latest in a string 
of Gangnam Style parodies to be posted on YouTube including one by 
pupils at Eton which has been viewed nearly 3m times.

Last week teachers at a school in 
Accrington, Lancashire were criticised by a councillor for 'undermining'
their pupils' respect for them by posting their Gangnam Style dance 
moves.

A hospital in 
Toronto, Canada, also came under fire after a version of the song was 
performed by staff in its maternity department.

Wyll
said: 'Gangnam Style was the biggest song of last year - but there 
weren't any Norfolk parodies on YouTube, so I thought I'd give it a go.

'It took me a couple of evenings to write the words. I just wanted to celebrate Norfolk and how it is a great place to live.

'My
father's family come from the countryside and you can't beat it. I 
filmed it at my nan's because I wanted to give the video a rural feel.

'The
response to it has been absolutely amazing. I only did it as a bit of a
joke - but now I have got over quarter of a million hits. It is just 
incredible.

'I've tried to get as many funny Norfolk stereotypes in there as possible, and I've had really good responses so far.

'The
reaction we've had to it is just crazy. I was a bit worried about using
the 'inbred lad' line, but people just see that as a joke.

'The
positive comments have just confirmed that it is a bit of fun. Nobody 
has taken real offence and most people seem to see the humorous side.

'A small number of people have criticised it, but they are generally from outside Norfolk.

'I have posted a few videos before of me messing around, but they have only had about 50 views each.'

Wyll said his video was viewed 300 times within two hours of him uploading it on Friday evening.He
added: 'When I got home it was just over 1,000 and by the morning it 
had doubled to 2,500 and within 24 hours it had reached 45,000.

'Within
a couple of days it was on the front page of YouTube as one of their 
featured videos and it was the most trending music video.'

Wyll is already considering a follow-up video to capitalise on the success of Norfolk Style, but says he will take his time.He
said: 'I haven't got a clue what it will be yet, but I want it to make 
it a good one. At the moment I'm still enjoying what we've done. I've 
been on the laptop for three days straight.

'I thought we'd missed the boat a bit, because there have been so many other parodies, but it's still popular.

'It's such a strange feeling, thinking that people from Australia and South Africa have been watching a video we made.'

The sixth former filmed himself singing the parody last Thursday with his friend Mateo Jarvis, 16, who is half Filipino performing Gangnam Style dance moves

The original Gangnam Style video shows Korean rapper Psy dancing with glamorous women and has become the most watched video on YouTube with 1.1billion views
