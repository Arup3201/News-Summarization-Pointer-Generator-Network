Warning: Certain bottles of Mars Milk are among the products being recalled after a type of bacteria known to cause food poisoning was found

Mars is recalling thousands of bottles of chocolate milk over fears that they could cause food poisoning.

Drinks including Mars Milk, Snickers Shake and Galaxy Smooth Milk are among those which consumers are being warned not to drink after 'elevated levels' of a type of bacteria was found.

The strand of bacterium found in the bottle, type of one known as Bacillus, produces toxins which can cause both vomiting and diarrhea.

It is usually found in prepared foods, 
particularly rice and leftovers, and can also be present in sauces, 
soups, and other foods that have sat out too long at room temperature.

The recall applies to batches carrying a best-before date between 19 December 2014 and 11 April 2015, inclusive.

The drinks were manufactured by German company Milchwerke Mittelelbe GMBH for Mars Chocolate Drinks.

A Mars spokesperson said: 'We are recalling all of the products listed as a precaution as they could pose a possible health risk due to the potential presence of a type of the bacteria known as Bacillus.'

She confirmed that the U.S. market is not affected as the bottles are not sold there.

Bottles of sports-cap drinks and larger 750ml 'fridge pack' drinks are being recalled.Â 

Sports-cap bottles of Mars Milk (350ml, 376 ml), Starburst Strawberry Drink (350 ml), Bounty 
Drink (350ml), Snickers Shake (350ml, 376 ml), Skittles Wildberry (376 
ml), Galaxy Smooth Milk (350ml, 376 ml), Milky Way Milk (350 ml), Mars 
Caramel Milk (350ml) and Skittles Fruits (350, 376ml).

Consumers are also warned not to drink Mars Milk (750 ml), Galaxy Smooth Milk (750ml) and Skittles Fruits (750 ml).

A
 Mars spokesperson said: 'We want to ensure that anyone in possession of
 these products with these best before dates is aware that they should 
not be consumed and that contact should be made with our consumer care 
team for more information.'

She continued: 'Mars Chocolate Drinks have spoken to the 
Food Standards Agency (FSA) to ensure all requirements are being 
followed.

'Mars and our suppliers take quality and food safety very 
seriously and apologise for any inconvenience.'

Health risks: Consumers have been warned over 350ml sports-cap bottles of Bounty Drink, Mars Caramel Milk and Starburst Strawberry Drink with best-before dates between 19 December 2014 and 11 April 2015

'We want to 
reassure consumers that no other pack formats or bottle sizes of branded
 milk drink products are affected.'

Product recall notices are being 
displayed in stores where the drinks are sold, advising consumers of the
 recall and what they can do if they have bought the affected products.

A
 spokesperson for Morrisons said: 'We have put posters up at customers 
service desks and signage where you would normally buy the drinks.'

In a statement on their website, the Food
 Standards Agency said: 'The Food Standards Agency has been informed by 
Mars Chocolate Drinks that it is recalling certain date codes of its 
milk drinks.

Manufacturers: The Mars Chocolate Drinks that are being recalled were made by Milchwerke Mittelelbe GMBH, based in Stendal, Germany, pictured. Mars Chocolate Drinks said that all products not listed are safe

'This is because they contain elevated levels of a type of bacteria known as Bacillus, which can cause food poisoning.

'This means the products are a possible health risk to consumers.'
