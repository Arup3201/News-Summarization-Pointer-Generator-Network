Aston Villa are rivalling neighbours West Bromwich Albion in a bid to take Chelsea wideman Victor Moses on loan.

Manager Paul Lambert also has an interest in Chelsea’s Christian Atsu but Moses, 23, represents a ready-made Premier League player.

The Nigerian international had an inauspicious loan spell at Liverpool last season.

Wanted: Victor Moses, pictured during his loan spell at Liverpool, is wanted by Aston Villa and West Brom

On the move: Moses joined Chelsea from Wigan Athletic in 2012 and has made 23 league appearances

Meanwhile, Lambert will revive his £4million move for Swansea midfielder Ki Sung-yeung also this week.

The South Korea international impressed on loan at Sunderland last term.
