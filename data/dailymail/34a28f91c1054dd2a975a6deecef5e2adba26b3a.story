An examination of a mountain lion killed by a Kentucky Fish and Wildlife official has found that it was a 125-pound male that appeared to be young and healthy.

But Fish and Wildlife officials still don't know whether it was a wild animal or one that escaped from captivity.

An agency officer thought it best to 'dispatch' the mountain lion after a concerned farmer spotted it in northern Bourbon County on Monday.

'It seemed to be in very healthy condition, and they determined pretty quickly that it didn't look like it had traveled long distances on foot,' agency spokesman Mark Marraccini said. 

Marraccini says the lion was killed because it was roaming free near a populated area, making it a public safety issue.

'If that cat had left that tree, it would have disappeared into the brush and it was a fairly populated area,' Marraccini told the Courier-Journal. 'I don't see any reason why it shouldn't be handled that way.'

He said if the mountain lion was a wild animal, it apparently would be the first one confirmed in Kentucky since before the Civil War.

'But that is a pretty big if,'' he said. 'They took some measurements today, but that's certainly not enough to go on without looking at everything in total.'

Amy Rodrigues, a staff biologist for the Mountain Lion Foundation, disagrees with Marraccini's assessment. 

'If you're a deer, they're a little dangerous. If you're a human, not so much,' she told the Courier-Journal. 'Attacks on people are not that common. There have only been 22 deaths in the last 120 years.'

The animal's DNA will be sent to an out-of-state wildlife lab to determine whether its genetic material matches any wild populaitons.

'They can determine the origin,' Marraccini said, though it won't be fast. He said it could take weeks to get an answer.

Mountain lions, which also are known as cougars and panthers, are the largest cats found in North America.

They were once native to the area but are most relegated to western states. They are now believed to number around 30,000 in North America.
