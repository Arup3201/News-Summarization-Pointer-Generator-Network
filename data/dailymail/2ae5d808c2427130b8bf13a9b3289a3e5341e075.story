A shipwrecked yacht containing £80million of cocaine and the decomposing body of a dead crew member has been found by divers in the Pacific.

The unusual discovery of the French-named vessel called Jereve, which was laden with 204 one-kilo blocks of cocaine, was made about ten miles north of Tonga's main island.

A second crew member from the 40ft yacht, which had been tracked by authorities since it left Ecuador in August, is missing leaving police in four countries trying to establish if he is dead or on the run.

The boat, which ran 
aground on a reef, was discovered 
by a group of divers who were exploring the area.

Police in Tonga said the body had been taken to Nuku'alofa, the capital of the island of Tongatapu, where it is hoped the cause of death can be established.

And police in Australia, Tonga, the Cook Island and the United States Drugs Enforcement Agency said yesterday that the drug-smuggling voyage had been organised by a crime syndicate with Australia believed to be the destination.

The neatly-packaged drugs were found hidden in the hull of the yacht, which is known to have a history of sailing in waters off central America and Colombia in South America.

The luxurious ship has three staterooms and space to sleep six people. The translation of its French name is 'I dream'.

David Sharpe, Acting Assistant Commissioner of the Australian Federal Police, said he was certain the drugs were bound for Australia

The wreck has left police trying to 
solve several questions including whether the man who was discovered on 
board had died before the yacht hit the reef.

Former New Zealand police officer Mr 
Grant O'Fee, who is now the Police Commissioner in Tonga, confirmed that
the body was that of a 'palagni' – the Tongan name for a white person 
and not a Pacific islander or a Latin American.

'We have not yet been able to establish his name and we have yet to ascertain the cause of death,' said Mr O'Fee.

But he confirmed that two men had been on board the vessel when it left Ecuador and it had been monitored by drug enforcement agencies.

The yacht had been under watch for nearly two months as it sailed across the Pacific, but then the agencies monitoring it lost contact on October 5.

Australian Federal Police (AFP) have sent forensic pathologists to Tonga to help with the investigation into the identity of the man.

Mr David Sharpe, Acting Assistant Commissioner of the AFP, said he was certain the drugs were bound for Australia.

Referring to the surveillance that had been place on the vessel earlier and the activity now surrounding it, he said it showed the value of collaboration between numerous countries spanning the Asia-Pacific region.

'This is an outstanding example of the effectiveness and strength of the relationships with our partners in the South Pacific and in the US to combat transnational crime in the region' said Mr Sharpe.

He said this was the fourth drug vessel since 2010 targeting Australia 'so that's a total of 1.1 tons of cocaine on four yachts that have been stopped from reaching the shores of Australia,' he said.

Mr O'Fee said forensic scientists would probably be analysing the corpse over the weekend.

'Identification of the body is not going to be an easy task, as you can imagine, ' he told Radio New Zealand.
