It is an incredibly rare phenomenon - and the shot of a lifetime.

A researcher at the Atacama Large Millimeter/submillimeter Array telescope control center in the Atacama desert captured this amazing image of a rainbow high over the Chilean desert.

The Operations Support Facility (OSF) lies some 2900 metres above sea level close to San Pedro de Atacama.

Armin Silber, a researcher at the Atacama Large Millimeter/submillimeter Array telescope control center in the Atacama desert captured this amazing image of a rainbow high over the Chilean desert.

High on the Chajnantor plateau in the Chilean Andes, the European Southern Observatory (ESO), together with its international partners, is operating the Atacama Large Millimeter/submillimeter Array (ALMA) — a state-of-the-art telescope to study light from some of the coldest objects in the Universe.

This light has wavelengths of around a millimetre, between infrared light and radio waves, and is therefore known as millimetre and submillimetre radiation. 

ALMA comprises 66 high-precision antennas, spread over distances of up to 16 kilometres. This global collaboration is the largest ground-based astronomical project in existence.

This rare rainbow appears over the Atacama Large Millimeter/submillimeter Array (ALMA) Operations Support Facility (OSF), which lies some 2900 metres above sea level close to San Pedro de Atacama.

The OSF isn’t just a location for operating the giant ALMA Observatory; it is also where new technologies are assembled, integrated, and verified before they are transported to their final destination on Chajnantor. 

The technology has to be assembled and tested at the OSF because the air is much denser there than on the plateau, and workers can complete their tasks without the adverse health risks associated with working at high altitude.

The telescope itself is high on the Chajnantor plateau in the Chilean Andes and is a state-of-the-art telescope to study light from some of the coldest objects in the Universe.

The secret to Alma's incredible resolution comes from two factors: height and distance.

The observatory's highest receivers sit on a plateau some 16,500ft (5,000 metres) above sea level.

This is far above most of Earth's atmosphere and water vapour, which obscures observations. Astronomers working in Alma's facility at 9,500 feet (2,900 meters) must use supplemental oxygen for extended stays.

With all the antennae working in unison as a giant telescope, the observatory will provide astronomers with a window into the early universe.

The rainbow was captured at the Atacama Large Millimeter/submillimeter Array telescope control center, where operators control the 'time machine telescope high in the mountains.

This is where cosmic secrets wait to be discovered, said project director Pierre Cox, who added Alma is poised to reach its full potential next year 

The $1.6 billion telescope, which began full-scale operation in March, has already spotted galaxies expelling gas and a star formation near the centre of the Milky Way's supermassive black hole.

It also has captured the first image of an icy ring around a distant star.

By collecting radio waves rather than optical light, Alma can look through the dense dust clouds of deep space.

This will give astronomers a glimpse of galaxies from just after the Big Bang.

It can also look at how individual stars and planets are formed. 

This could shine a light on our creation as it is believed the elements spewed out by dying stars went on the seed the sun, the planets and, eventually, humans.

The system currently comprises about 50 functional antennas. When the latest array is finished, there will be 66 of these receivers that can be moved as far as 16km (9.9m) apart.

The
 antennae capture astronomical signals from the sky individually, then 
combine their results in a supercomputer to get precise information 
about where the signals come from. 

Researchers say it is similar to how we use our two ears to locate sounds around us, but on a universe-size scale.

This
 high-resolution not only lets Alma observe young planetary systems, but
 also pin down hydrogen and life-building blocks in gas clouds. The array can also track the evolution of galaxies.
