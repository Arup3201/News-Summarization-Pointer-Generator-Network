Frustrated residents from a public housing community have come together to protest about a number of violent tenants who repeatedly vandalise both their own and public properties.

Patty McDonald, who has lived in the area of Grafton in northern New South Wales for the last 27 years, was forced to use her pension money to install six security cameras around her home.

The 69-year-old grandmother's said that she captures footage of anti-social behaviour, which has been provided to both courts and Housing New South Wales in the past, 'at least once a week, sometimes several times a day'.

Led by Patty McDonald, the public housing community at Grafton in northern New South Wales, have come together to protest about a number of violent tenants in the area

Ms McDonald, who has lived in the area  for the last 27 years, was forced to use her pension money to install six security cameras around her home

'I've been threatened that the house will be burnt down, I've been told I'm going to be dead,' Ms McDonald told A Current Affair of the constant stream of violence.

'Somebody's going to lose their life before this is stopped.'

But Ms McDonald is not alone in her community. Dozens of other residents have had their property damaged and their home's broken into by the tenants, who are involved in a constant cycle of eviction and relocation.

'They've broken into my house twice, trashed the place, stolen all my stuff,' one local resident said.

CCTV footage recorded on Ms McDonald's property and at the town's local community centre, shows locals trying to dismantle the cameras or hitting them with large poles while screaming out

'They've broken into my house twice, trashed the place, stolen all my stuff,' one local resident (right) said. 'If the neighbour goes out, I stay home. When she's home, I'll go out. That's how bad it gets,' a second neighbour, Denise (left), said

'If the neighbour goes out, I stay home. When she's home, I'll go out. That's how bad it gets,' a second neighbour, Denise, said.

Retiree's Rob and Janet, who now sleep in separate rooms of the house so they can keep watch at night, told A Current Affair that their home was broken into twice in the one night.

But it's not just resident's homes that the vandals are targeting. The local council has refused to replace childrens' play equipment in a nearby park due to previous constructions being repeatedly vandalised and burnt to the ground.

The Department of Family and Community Services has said they are 'taking complaints of anti-social behaviour seriously,' and that two different tenants had recently been evicted while a third was due for eviction in December

'Take the f***ing cameras down now!' a person can be heard saying in one video.

'Patty you old dog, take them cameras down now you mother f*****!'

Despite the community hosting emergency meetings and claiming little to nothing is done by police and Housing NSW, the Department of Family and Community Services told A Current Affair that they are 'taking complaints of anti-social behaviour seriously,' and that two different tenants had recently been evicted while a third was due for eviction in December.

Ms McDonald and her neighbours have chosen to band together against the ongoing violence rather than request relocation, with the 69-year-old defiantly stating: 'If I leave, then I have to give in'.
