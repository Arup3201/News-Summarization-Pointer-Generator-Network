Cardiff have signed Birmingham midfielder Tom Adeyemi for £1million as a direct replacement for Jordon Mutch, who joined QPR for £6m on Tuesday.

The 22-year-old former Norwich City midfielder has signed a three-year deal with the Championship club. 

'I'm delighted he has signed. He will give us physical presence,' said manager Ole Gunnar Solskjaer.

'He will add a dimension to our team. That physical presence in midfield - I was looking for it '

'We have done a good bit of business definitely. He has only one year left of his contract at Birmingham. So it was just the right time for us.'

Elsewhere, Hull striker Nick Proschwitz has joined Brentford, who have also taken on Tommy Smith after he impressed while on trial.

Fleetwood have confirmed the signing of Crystal Palace striker Stephen Dobbie on a season loan. Manager Graham Alexander has also brought in Newcastle's teenage forward Adam Campbell on loan. 

Finally, Blackpool have signed Bristol City goalkeeper Elliott Parish.
