The RFU have launched an investigation into allegations that Welsh referee Nigel Owens was subjected to homophobic abuse by a small section of the Twickenham crowd during England’s loss to New Zealand on Saturday.

A claim was made on Wednesday that Owens, who came out in 2007, was subjected to ‘disgusting vitriol’ by one member of the crowd and the sport’s governing body has promised to investigate.

A spokesman said: ‘The RFU condemns all forms of discrimination and aims to ensure that all people, irrespective of their age, gender, ability, race, religion, ethnic origin, creed, colour, nationality, social status or sexual orientation, have a genuine and equal opportunity to enjoy rugby union in whatever form, on or off the pitch, at all levels and in all roles.

'As a lifelong rugby fan, a straight man in his 60s, I could not believe that a bunch of men half my age watching a rugby match in the 21st century could be capable of hurling such nasty, foul-mouthed, racist, homophobic abuse at an openly gay match official,' Keith Wilson, from South Yorkshire, wrote in a letter to The Guardian on Wednesday.

'My equally disgusted son is in his 30s but next to him, hearing this vitriol, was a little boy.

'I felt ashamed.'

‘We take any allegations of any abuse very seriously and are investigating this matter.’

A national newspaper received a letter of complaint regarding an individual’s behaviour during the game in which the fellow spectator complained about abuse directed at Owens, who considered suicide as a young man before coming out.

Owens said: ‘If someone has gone to the trouble to send a letter to the paper and say that this was disgusting and the behaviour was totally out of order, then I would think what they shouted was pretty bad and if that is the case then these people should be banned from the game.

‘They need to be told that some behaviour is not acceptable, that crossing the line of what is humour and banter is a fine line but if you cross it then you have to put up with the consequences.’

Owens, a role model for the gay community as one of only a handful of openly homosexual people in rugby, is widely considered to be one of the world’s best referees.

He added: ‘What has become more evident is that while we may not be so aware of it on the field, I think we become more aware of it now through social media.

‘When you see things that are tweeted by so-called rugby supporters about opposition teams and some of the tweets that I have had, you begin thinking, “Bloody hell, are these type of people really in our game?”

‘I have had homophobic tweets and messages on Facebook from people who are shouting things that I could not repeat in your newspaper.

‘It is creeping into the game and some of the tweets I have had are pretty nasty, really.

‘Sometimes you get these comments and read these tweets and you think, “Do I really need this? Do I really need to do this job?”

‘It does get you down and I honestly feel sometimes like saying: ‘Enough is enough, I will walk away from it all.’ 

Owens has vowed to carry on and will take charge of France against Australia this weekend

‘But then you get support from people and it makes you realise these are the minority and you have to pick yourself up and rise above it. It is not always easy to do that but you have to do it and get on.

‘I don’t think it is a huge problem in rugby but I think it is an increasing problem as last Saturday has proved.

‘People have said when I came out I would be a role model to young people who are dealing with becoming who they are within rugby and other sports and I understand that now.

‘But the people who do more good are not myself but are the people like Keith Wilson (who highlighted the abuse in a letter to the media) who stood up to these louts.

‘They are the true, genuine rugby people who can make a difference more than I can.

A fan sparked the RFU probe by claiming he was 'ashamed' at the abuse aimed at Owens

‘I’d be lying if I said it didn’t affect me — you get disappointed and down when you see it. It gets to you but you have to go out there and prove them wrong. It’s about showing your character. You want to show them they won’t push you out of the game you adore.

‘We are only human and when people say horrible things about you, it gets in your mind.

‘But it’s also about setting an example to those coming through the system. You want to show them you stood up for yourself and got through it.

‘I couldn’t go out and do my job as a referee if comments made by fans or anyone else got to me. I’ve had it since I started as a referee, but for a player it’s different.

‘They’re not used to putting up with that stuff from supporters — it’s totally unacceptable. I’ve had to take abuse as a referee and in my case it was a little different.

‘I’m refereeing France against Australia this weekend which is a massive game. And I need to stick two fingers up to those who shouted abuse at me. I need to go out there and prove them wrong.’
