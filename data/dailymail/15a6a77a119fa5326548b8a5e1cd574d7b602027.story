A buyer in California has spent $16,000 on the high-backed leather chair used by evil genius Blofeld in the James Bond films.

The iconic piece of furniture, in which the Bond baddie sat while stroking a white cat, had been expected to sell for around $3,000.

But fierce bidding drove the price up to more than five times that estimate before it was finally snapped up, and will make the perfect Christmas present for a horrible boss.

The chair used by Bond baddie Ernst Stavro Blofeld in You Only Live Twice has sold for $16,000 at auction, and will make the perfect Christmas present for any ill-tempered boss

The sight of Bond's nemesis, full name Ernst Stavro Blofeld, sitting in the high-backed, black leather chair is one of the defining images of the film franchise and can now be recreated in the boardroom.

The sight of Blofeld sitting in the chair stroking his white cat has become one of the defining images of the whole Bond franchise

Blofeld, head of the terrorist organisation SPECTRE, was played by British actor Donald Pleasence in the 1967 film You Only Live Twice, the fifth to star Sean Connery as 007. 

The chair was among a host of props from Bond films sold at Julien's Auctions in California as part of a liquidation sale by Pinewood Studios.

A model helicopter, which was named Little Nellie and was used for filming aerial fight scenes in You Only Live Twice, fetched $23,000. 

The mobile phone remote control Pierce Brosnan used to drive his BMW in the 1997 film Tomorrow Never Dies was also snapped up for $6,000.

Darren Julien, the auction house CEO, said: 'James Bond 007 lived up to his bigger than life persona in our recent auction event.

'Blofeld's chair from You Only Live Twice as well as the helicopter prop from the same film were highlights amongst the bidders.' 

The next installment in the Bond series is due out next year and will star Christoph Waltz, from Quentin Tarantino's Django Unchained, as the villain.

The film will be called Spectre, the name of Blofeld's organisation, raising the prospect that Watz could reprise the role originally brought to life by Donald Pleasence. 

Among the other items up for sale was the model helicopter Little Nellie, piloted by Sean Connery and used to film aerial combat scenes in You Only Live Twice, fetching $23,000
