TUESDAY

Champion Hurdle, 3.20

A race dominated by Irish entries, with Jessica Harrington’s defending champion, Jezki, ridden by AP McCoy. But Willie Mullins holds the strongest hand. He has three entries headed by unbeaten favourite Faugheen and dual champion Hurricane Fly. The New One, trained by Nigel Twiston-Davies and ridden by son Sam, bids to atone for last year’s unlucky third.

WEDNESDAY

Queen Mother Champion Chase, 3.20

Sprinter Sacre, the 2013 winner, and last year’s champion Sire De Grugy, finally go head to head. They must cope with form horse Dodging Bullets and, with front-runners Special Tiara and dual Festival winner Champagne Fever in the field, it will be fast and furious.

THURSDAY

World Hurdle, 3.20

With Rock On Ruby out and Mullins-trained mare Annie Power taking up her entry in Tuesday’s Mares’ Hurdle, the betting is dominated by Paul Nicholls’s pair Saphir Du Rheu and Zarkandar. The champion trainer says there is little between them. There are positive vibes for Nicky Henderson’s Whisper, while best of the Irish looks to be Lieutenant Colonel.

FRIDAY

Gold Cup, 3.20

Carlingford Lough is McCoy’s last throw of the dice and he has claims in an open race featuring last year’s winner Lord Windermere, and the three horses who chased him home. They include 2014 fourth-placed Silviniaco Conti. He seems improved with an ulcer problem sorted. The concern is that his best form has been away from Cheltenham. Holywell, Road To Riches, Many Clouds and well-backed Djakadam head the clutch of new kids on the block on an upward form curve who must also be considered.
