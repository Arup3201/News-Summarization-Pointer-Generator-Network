Brave dental nurse Naomie Greenslade posed for a selfie with two of her friends as she awaited medics to stitch up two horrific knife wounds on her hip and leg. 

The 22-year-old dental nurse was walking home after a night out in Marrakesh, Morocco when a street robber tried to steal her bag which contained just 13p. 

Ms Greenslade refused to hand over the bag and was slashed with a butcher-type knife across her left hip and down her thigh.

The robber tried to stab her in the chest before slashing open her left leg, leaving her with a gaping wound in her thigh

The razor-sharp blade sliced through Ms Greenslade's skin, opening up a gash two inches wide and at least 12 inches long.  

A young British charity worker was left with an horrific stab wound when she was attacked by a Moroccan street robber for just 13p.

Naomie Greenslade, 22, was attacked by the knife-wielding mugger when she refused to hand over her bag while walking home after going out for a meal with friends in Marrakesh.

The robber tried to stab her in the chest before slashing open her left leg, leaving her with a gaping wound in her thigh.

The dental nurse, who has been volunteering at orphanages in the Moroccan city, was taken to hospital where she received more than 20 metal stitches to her left hip and upper leg. 

Ms Greenslade has now told how she was attacked in the walled city, which has become a popular tourist destination.

She said: 'A group of ten of us had gone out to get some dinner and we were walking back to our accommodation around midnight.

'We were walking at normal speed and chatting. We were not intoxicated and there were three guys with us so you'd think you are safe but these guys out here don't care.'

Ms Greenslade said the group heard shouting before she was grabbed.

She said: 'I turned around and a guy had a big butcher's knife with a blue handle that he pointed to my chest and started screaming in Arabic.

Ms Greenslade was taken to hospital where she received more than 20 metal stitches (left) to her left hip and upper leg following the attack. The knife wound left a second scar, right, on her left hip area 

'I knew he wanted my bum bag which I had around my waist. I refused to give it to him. He tried to plunge the knife into my chest but I managed to jump back. But he slashed me.

'I didn't realise I had been hurt. I looked down and my bag was ripped off me. Everything fell on the floor - make-up, my phone, my purse which had the equivalent of about 13p in it.'

Ms Greenslade, who volunteers with the Welsh Ambulance Service in her spare time, said she thought she was going to die when she saw the wound in her leg.

She said: 'I began feeling very faint and slumped to the floor. The guys took their tops off and wrapped my leg up tight - they kept me awake until the ambulance arrived.'

Ms Greenslade, from Bargoed, near Caerphilly, South Wales, is now resting after being released from hospital - but says she won't be coming home early.

She said: 'I came out here to work with orphans and I have managed to visit a baby centre despite my injuries.

Ms Greenslade was volunteering in a Moroccan orphanage when she was attacked by the mugger 

'I don't want to be beaten by this attack but it has knocked my confidence. I won't be coming back to Morrocco.'

Remarkably, Ms Greenslade said if she was in the same situation again she still wouldn't hand over her bag.

She said: 'I refused to give it to him. It had my phone in with all the irreplaceable pictures from my trip. There was no way I would hand it over.'

A man has today been charged with attempted murder.
