His £3.1million Berkshire home was raided by police just 12 days ago.

But now, Sir Cliff Richard has been pictured sipping champagne with friends at a restaurant on the coast of Portugal.

Donning a purple top with a red shirt underneath, the pop star appeared in good spirits as he stood on the balcony of Bellavita pizzeria, situated near his Algarve villa.

The 73-year-old smiled, laughed and engaged in light-hearted discussion with his six companions, which included his loyal friend and former priest John McElynn, as well as Irish singer Daniel O'Donnell and his wife Majella. He then sipped Bollinger champagne from a straw as they watched the sunset.

Mr O'Donnell, who has known Sir Cliff since the 1980s, has publicly backed his friend, describing the star's treatment by police as 'unfair'.

Speaking to the Belfast Telegraph, Mr O'Donnell described Sir Cliff as a 'really genuine, good person who would do nothing to anybody, least of all a child'.

He added: 'I think the way it has all been conducted is definitely unfair and not in keeping with the law. It is like there is some kind of witch- hunt.'

His wife, herself a singer and writer, has also shown her support for Sir Cliff, writing on Twitter that the way he had been treated was 'completely unacceptable'.

The
 pictures are believed to be the first taken of Sir Cliff since his 
apartment was stormed by police in a raid that was broadcast live on the
 BBC from a helicopter hovering overhead.

On Saturday, the singer threw a lunch party for friends at his £3million holiday home, 'Vida Nova', in Guia after a 15-hour round trip to the UK to be interviewed by police over child abuse claims.

He was hugged by half a dozen loyal friends who he invited to the 16-acre estate, greeting them with Mr McElynn by his side. Later, the party left to play tennis in balmy 77F (25C) sunshine.

Just hours earlier, Sir Cliff travelled to Britain on a private jet to attend a police premises in South Yorkshire. The star voluntarily met officers who interviewed him under caution.

He was not arrested or charged over the allegation of sexual assault on a boy under 16 at an event held by American evangelist Billy Graham at Sheffield United’s Bramall Lane stadium in 1985.

Afterwards, Sir Cliff is thought to have taken a private plane direct from Doncaster to Faro, arriving at 9pm on Saturday night.

Taking a break: The star voluntarily met officers who interviewed him under caution. He was not arrested or charged over the allegation of sexual assault on a boy under 16 at an event held at a stadium in 1985

His 
spokesman told the Daily Mail: ‘Sir Cliff Richard voluntarily met with 
and was interviewed by members of South Yorkshire Police. He was not arrested or charged. He co-operated fully with officers and answered the questions put to him.

‘Other
 than restating that this allegation is completely false and that he 
will continue to co-operate fully with police, it would not be 
appropriate for Sir Cliff to say anything further at this time.’

South Yorkshire Police confirmed that a 73-year-old man had ‘entered South Yorkshire Police premises by arrangement’.

No warning: Sir Cliff, pictured with a waiter and friend, was not given any prior warning of the raid on August 14

Among friends: Sir Cliff is pictured smiling as he is joined by two female companions on the sunlit balcony

Supportive: Sir Cliff Richard is seem with his loyal companion, former priest John McEllyn, outside the pizzeria

Following the raid on Sir Cliff's Berkshire home on August 14, the police chief leading the inquiry accused the BBC of a ‘cover-up’ over how its journalists learned the star’s property would be raided.

The Corporation has received 762 complaints over its live coverage of the incident.

Sir Cliff - who was not given any prior warning of the raid - was said to be furious it was broadcast on TV before he had been spoken to by police.

Meanwhile, Keith Vaz, the chairman of the Commons Home Affairs Committee, said the claims of a cover-up were a ‘matter of deep concern’.

Companions: John McElynn (second left) is pictured with Mr and Mrs O'Donnell,  and a waiter (far left) at the restaurant

He has summoned the South Yorkshire chief constable and BBC director general Lord Hall to appear before his committee on September 2.

Lord Hall has insisted that BBC journalists ‘acted appropriately’ in their coverage of the story.

Since the raid, Sir Cliff has shunned the limelight and cancelled public appearances to remain at Vida Nova, which he described as a place to ‘withdraw’ and engage in some ‘mental therapy’ in his autobiography.
