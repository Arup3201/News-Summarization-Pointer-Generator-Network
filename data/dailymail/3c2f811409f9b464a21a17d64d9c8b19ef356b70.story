A day centre for the elderly has been engulfed in flames in what firefighters have described as a serious blaze fanned by strong winds.

Fire crews said they expected to remain at the scene on Dermot Murphy Close in the Old Moat area of Withington, Manchester, throughout the night after being met with a 'well-developed fire in the property'.

Firefighters responded to reports of smoke in the area at around 9pm yesterday. Strong winds have fanned the flames, making efforts to fight the blaze difficult, officers said.
