For many children growing up in the 1990s, Sonic the Hedgehog was one of the coolest characters to feature in a computer game

For many children growing up in the 1990s, Sonic the Hedgehog was one of the coolest characters to feature in a computer game.

As video games were in their infancy, most people were thrilled with the heavily pixelated graphics, but never got to see 'Green Hill' - the setting of Act 1 from the original Sonic the Hedgehog game released in 1991 - from the speedy hedgehog's point of view.

However, a stomach-churning video now lets nostalgic gamers see the game as they never have before as they race along and dodge obstacles as Sonic the Hedgehog.

Sonic made his first major appearance in the now-iconic game, Sonic
the Hedgehog, for the Sega Mega Drive/Genesis where he ran through 2D 
levels to try and save the 'world' from his nemesis, Dr. Robotinic.

The character is a blue 15-year-old anthropomorphic hedgehog, who has the 
ability to run at supersonic speeds as well as curl into a ball,
primarily to attack enemies.

Throughout the course of the many video games, 
Sonic most commonly has to race through levels, collect power up rings 
and survive against a host of natural obstacles and robotic evil minions to achieve
his goal.

The video by Machinima, a gaming news channel on YouTube, takes gamers on a familiar journey through the first mini level that they have probably played many times but with a new viewpoint.Â 

While fans of the platform game might risk motion sickness watching the video, they can avoid vicious robots and dodge sharp-toothed jumping fish, while riding out the bumps and clambering over the rocks that litter the course in the first mini level - all through the eyes of the spiny blue mammal.

The really nauseating moments of the video come when Sonic bounces on platforms to leap over fierce metal spikes and negotiates the loop-the-loop tracks.

And that's before the soul-destroying moment familiar to many children of the nineties when the hapless hedgehog loses all the rings just before completing the stage.

However, a stomach-churning video now lets nostalgic gamers see the first Sonic game as they never have before as they race along and dodge obstacles as 'the blue blur'. A Slightly later game title is pictured

While fans of the 'the blue blur' will have played games on later consoles where they follow the hedgehog or share Sonic's viewpoint, this is the first time gamers have got a hog's-eye-view on the very first major game he was featured in.

Sonic was a huge gaming icon of the nineties and featured in numerous spin-off comics, four animated shows as well as on countless pieces of merchandise.

The first game,on which this video is based, was released on 23 June 1991 and the character was created for Sega so that the Japanese gaming company had a mascot to rival Nintendo's Mario.

Since then, Sonic the Hedgehog has 
become one of the world's best-known video game characters and over 80 
million copies of various games featuring the hedgehog have been sold.

In
2005, Sonic was one of the first characters to be inducted into the 
Walk of Game, along with Mario and Link, who featured in The Legend of 
Zelda.

Amazingly, the first Sonic game was created by a group of just 15 people.
