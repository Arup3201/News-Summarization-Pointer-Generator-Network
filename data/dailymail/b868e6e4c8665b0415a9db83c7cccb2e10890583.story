It's common courtesy not to put your feet up on the back of someone's seat, take your shirt off or clip your fingernails while on an aircraft.

But it seems these annoying travellers haven't yet got the memo.

Luckily, there's a platform for disgruntled travellers to shame disgusting and space-hogging fellow passengers - and here are the photos to prove it.

It's common courtesy not to put your feet up on the back of someone's seat but  some travellers haven't got the memo and here are the photos to prove it

Passenger Shaming is a platform for disgruntled travellers to shame bad habits and space-hogging fellow passengers like this man who obviously thought he was still at home

Passenger Shaming was set up in January 2013 to highlight some of the less than desirable habits some have adopted while flying.

The photos, which are submitted anonymously by passengers and flight attendants, are posted to Facebook and Instagram and the results are sure to shock.

There's people resting their feet near people's head and on tray tables, as well as people sleeping with their feet in awkward positions. 

It was set up in January 2013 to highlight some of the less than desirable habits some have adopted while flying, including leaving used nappies and food on the floor

This man decided being seated on a busy plane was the perfect time to clip his fingernails

The photos, like this one of a woman resting her feet on the tray table, are posted to Facebook and Instagram

Passenger Shaming was created by Shawn Kathleen who has been a flight attendant since 2010

People have captured their fellow passengers in all sorts of weird sleeping positions, including this man who decided it was a good idea to sleep with his feet in the aisle

But then there's photos of people changing children's nappies on tray tables and remarkably leaving them on the floor or in the back seat pocket when they disembark. 

Shawn Kathleen is responsible for the page and has been a flight attendant since 2010. 

She has previously mentioned some her most feared habits, including people who don't flush the toilet and people going into the bathroom without shoes or socks.

Even flight attendants are happy to get in on the passenger shaming with one stewardess finding a set of teeth in the seat pocket

This man who appeared to be using a pillow case instead of an eye mask drew attention from others 

Surely this can't be comfortable? The Facebook page has drawn attention from passengers right around the world and currently has more than 17,500 likes

This woman's attire was enough to annoy one passenger who anonymously submitted this photo

This man managed to fall asleep with his hand down his pants much to the disgust of others

But it seems he's not the only one with this gentleman drifting right off to sleep

Photos of unsupervised children vandalising the aeroplane with stickers and crayons have also made the cut for Passenger Shaming. 

The Facebook page has drawn attention from passengers right around the world and currently has more than 17,500 likes. 

Ms Kathleen also started a blog last year titled Rants Of A Sassy Stew, which document the strife she encounters up in the air. 

Shawn Kathleen, who has been a flight attendant since 2010, says her pet hate is people not flushing the toilet. But imagine her shock when this photo of urine in the sink was sent through

It was certainly a good flight for this passenger whose in-flight entertainment was interrupted by a mop of hair 

This passenger's long legs were on display for everyone to see

This passenger chose to rest their feet on the head of someone else, presumably someone they knew, but it still disgusted others
