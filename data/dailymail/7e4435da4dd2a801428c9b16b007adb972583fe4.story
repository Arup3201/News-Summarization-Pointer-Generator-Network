An airline has infuriated many with a casting call for a commercial looking only for light skinned people.

AeroMexico and ad agency Catatonia have been forced to apologize after a casting call was sent out for an airline commercial saying dark-skinned people would not be allowed.

The casting call specifically asked for people who looked like they came from a wealthy neighborhood of Mexico City.

Mexican Blogger Tamara De Anda took a picture of the casting call and tweeted it August 8 to her over 19,000 followers, causing a firestorm of criticism to rain down on the two companies.

Backpedalling from the original request, both companies moved to distance themselves from the notice, even blaming it on an unidentified third company.

The casting call, in Spanish, said ‘nadie Moreno,’ meaning no dark-skinned people would be allowed. Additionally, it asked specifically for ‘Polanco’ looking people, a refence to the well-heeled Mexico-City area.

Taking it one step further, the notice also barred blonde-haired, blue eyed people from appearing.

De Anda, in a post to her blog translated from Spanish, explained it was just another example of the blatant racism seen in the country.

‘Outside of government program announcements, NGOs, ‘folkloric’ tourism foundations about ‘our native cultures,’ brown people do not exist. In general, not only are indigenous people deleted (unless they appear in their traditional costumes).’

Shortly after De Anda posted the blog entry, her phone became inundated with calls from a phone number she did not recognize, according to an update to the original blog entry. When she finally answered, she was told she violated a confidentiality agreement and that there could be legal consequences.

Not long after the post, the ad agency apologized for the discriminatory search.

‘Catatonia offers a heartfelt apology for the publication on casting requirements that circulated on social networks,’ the company said in a statement. ‘The language used by the casting company that made the publication was inadequate.’

AeroMexico was also quick to apologize, but left the ad agency to shoulder the blame.

‘We are sorry for Catatonia’s discriminatory stance… we offer our sincerest apology and reiterate our respect for all people, no matter their gender, language, religion, nor their skin color,’ the airline said in a statement posted to Twitter.

Disadvantaged: A far greater portion of dark-skinned people, versus light-skinned people, live below the poverty line in Mexico

In Mexico, as in many Latin American countries, the majority of actors and other personalities on TV, in movies and advertisements being light-skinned and the majority of the wealth concentrated with light-skinned  people, race is a sensitive issue.

‘On television, in politics and in academia, you see light-skinned people… In the priciest neighborhoods, the homeowners have light skin, and the housekeepers are dark. Everyone knows this, and yet no one talks about it, at least not in elite circles,’ Ruben Navarrette Jr., wrote in a 2012 CNN op-ed.

Though discrimination is illegal south of the border, 93 per cent of Mexico City residents responding to a government survey said they believed there was discrimination in hiring on the basis of race, according to the Latin Times.

Additionally, while most people in Mexico can trace their lineage to some combination of indigenous ancestors, and 6.7 million speak an indigenous language, 80 per cent of darker-skinned people live below the poverty line, according to a separate study.

AeroMexico has not responded to multiple requests for comment.
