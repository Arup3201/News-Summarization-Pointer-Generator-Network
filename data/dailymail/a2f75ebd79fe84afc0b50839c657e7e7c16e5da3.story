An aspiring transgender hip-hop artist who bragged of carrying out black-market 'body sculpting' on thousands of women has been convicted of murder after a botched injection killed a British dancer.

Padge-Victoria Windslowe's testimony during her Philadelphia trial included claims she was 'the Michelangelo of buttocks injections' and model Amber Rose was 'a walking billboard' for her work.

However, the former 'Black Madam' had no medical training, using only tips she picked up from the overseas doctors who performed her sex change operation and a client of her escort service.

Today, she was found guilty of third-degree murder after one of her 'patients', Claudia Aderotimi, 20, a London break-dancer and college student, died from an illegal silicone injection in her buttocks.

Miss Aderotimi, who paid $2,000 to be injected by Windslowe at an airport hotel in 2011, was rushed to hospital after complaining of chest pain and shortness of breath. She died just a few hours later. 

It was later revealed the silicone in her buttocks had moved to her lungs and stopped her heart.

During her murder trial, Windslowe said of her 'body sculpting': 'I was the best, and I don't mean that to be cocky,' explaining why celebrities would have sought her out over a licensed plastic surgeon.

The 45-year-old described herself as a serial entrepreneur who once ran a transgender escort service, as well as a Gothic hip-hop performer who called herself 'the Black Madam.'

Last week, her trial was halted for several days after she was hospitalized with chest pains. She has been in prison since 2012 after an 18-month inquiry led to a homicide ruling and an arrest warrant.

The jury got the case Friday. They were choosing between third-degree murder - not premeditated but involves malice - and involuntary manslaughter, involving reckless disregard for a person's life.

In addition to third-degree murder, Windslowe was also convicted of aggravated assault for injuries to a Philadelphia woman who became seriously ill after paying for one of the injections.

And the jury found her guilty of two weapons counts - the weapon in question being the industrial-grade silicone. Windslowe faces 20 to 40 years in prison on the murder conviction alone.

Miss Aderotimi's family in England chose not to attend the trial. The long-time friend who accompanied her to Philadelphia to celebrate her birthday also declined to make the trip. 

The friend's 2012 testimony, read aloud in court, described the meeting as 'a touch-up' after their prior visit to the woman they knew as 'Lillian.'

Windslowe name-dropped the likes of rappers Nicki Minaj and Kanye West and athlete Serena Williams during her testimony. She also claimed to have been baptized 'Genevieve' by the late Roman Catholic Cardinal Anthony Bevilacqua. 

Amber Rose's agents did return messages seeking comment about the claim she was a client.

The evidence showed that Windslowe traveled to hotel rooms and 'pumping parties' with her tools of the trade stuffed into a shiny pink purse: a water bottle filled with silicone, a red plastic cup, needles and syringes, and Krazy Glue to close the injection sites.

There have been several similar deaths nationwide involving underground buttocks injections.

A mother of three who died in Texas after having work done at a tile store died in April 2011. A Columbian couple is serving up to eight years in prison for manslaughter in that case.

Windslowe, who went on the run after Miss Aderotimi's death, lowered her head during the closing arguments Friday as a prosecutor described her victim as 'a regular girl' who had asked if the injections could interfere with her ability to have children.

When Miss Aderotimi began having chest pains afterward, Windslowe 'kept up that ruse' of being a physician's assistant, Assistant District Attorney Bridget Kirn told the jury last week.

'She put her hand on this young lady's chest as if she were doing an exam,' Kirn said. 

'But there was no exam.'

Addressing the court, defense lawyer David Rudenstein said the potential dangers of her injections were not clear to his client, Windslowe, because she only knew of satisfied customers.

'Clearly with all the information from this case, we know it shouldn't be done, it's too risky,' Rudenstein told the court. 'We know that now. But we didn't know that then.'
