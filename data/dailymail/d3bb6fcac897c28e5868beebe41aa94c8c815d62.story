Socialist Francois Hollande performed a dramatic U-turn on the economy yesterday by announcing he would slash public spending by 50billion euros (£43billion).

With his stagnant country being compared to the economic disaster zone of Greece, and his popularity at rock bottom, Mr Hollande announced a four per cent reduction in budgets for national and local authorities.

The French leader’s volte-face came two years after he turned his back on eurozone austerity that ‘cannot be our horizon’.

Yesterday the President, who has witnessed the wealthy fleeing France because of his crushing 75 per cent tax rate, signalled he would go easier on businesses by reducing ‘certain taxes’.

In another about-turn, he also said he wanted to simplify French bureaucracy and petty rules in a country notorious for its red tape.

‘We must begin a new battle. The challenge is not just that France finds growth, but it needs to be vigorous,’ said Mr Hollande.

Speaking at his press conference, he was asked why so many French youngsters under the age of 25 were leaving for more economically successful countries such as the UK.

‘I often meet these young people when I go abroad,’ said the French leader. ‘They are ambassadors of our country across the world.

'We hope they come back. How do we get them back? It’s an employment issue and a question of pay.’

He said France needed to bounce back from recession, saying that a ‘responsibility pact’ with big business would be the key.

Mr Hollande said that ‘everyone will be involved - businesses, unions, local authorities. No time must be lost. France must bounce back and get back on the right foot’.

The plan effectively involves the government reducing the cost of hiring labour in return for increased recruitment, so as to cut down on a jobless figure past the 3million mark.

In another controversial announcement, the left-wing leader vowed to enact a record expulsion of 20,000 Roma gypsies from France.

Despite condemnation from the European Commission, the president said he was determined to crack down on the numbers arriving from Romania and Bulgaria.

French police demolished 165 out of 400 illegal Roma camps last year, pushing almost 20,000 people out in the process, according to figures collected by France’s League of Human Rights and the European Roma Rights Centre.

Mr Hollande also defended his decision to send troops to the the troubled African states of Mali and Central African Republic last year, saying both ‘would have been worse without the intervention.’
