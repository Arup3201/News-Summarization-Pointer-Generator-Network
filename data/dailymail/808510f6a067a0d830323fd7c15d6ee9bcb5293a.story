Convicted Ponzi schemer Bernie Madoff has said that he doesn't think he has got anything left to live for but refutes any suggestions that he purposely betrayed Jewish people in an interview given from his jail cell in North Carolina.

Asked whether he was afraid of death, Madoff, 75, replied that he is not because it could never compare with being ostracized and rejected by his family for the shame he has brought them.

The disgraced financier admitted his responsibility for the 2010 suicide of his son Mark, fighting back tears as he complained, 'The thing that was important to me was family, but that's all gone. That's more punishment than being incarcerated.'

Defiant: Bernie Madoff has used a recent interview to unleash his opinions on politics and his enormous multi-billion dollar Ponzi fraud scheme

Madoff, who is serving 150-years in prison for operating a Ponzi scheme that is conservatively estimated to have stolen $18 billion, came clean to his wife Ruth and their children Mark and Andrew at the end of 2008.

They turned him over to authorities, but the shame of his father's deception proved too much for Mark - who hung himself.

'I hold myself responsible for his suicide,' he said to Politico's MJ Lee. 'My grandchildren are without their father. That’s probably the worst.'

Ruth, Andrew and Mark all have maintained that they were in the dark as to Madoff's enormous financial scams.

For her part, Ruth has said that she regrets not cutting off ties with her husband of 54-years sooner - which her eldest son Mark requested before his death.

Now she only communicates with Madoff about health issues - mainly his youngest son Andrew's battle with lymphoma.

Madoff told Politico he believes in God and that he prays every day for the health of his family.

He declined to talk about the last conversation he ever had with his wife, claiming only to understand his decision to distance herself from him.

Madoff also turned his anger on Jude Denny Chin who sentenced him to 150-years for his 'extraordinary evil'.

'How do you give a 70-year-old man a 150-year sentence?' he asked.

'I think the judge is an idiot. For all intents and purposes, it’s a life sentence.'

Indeed, it is Madoff's deception within New York's Jewish community which he sees as an unfair accusation too.

Accepting responsibility: Police remove Mark Madoff's body from his apartment where he was found dead in New York on December 11, 2010 - in a recent interview his father accepted full responsibility for his son's death

Tragic: Mark Madoff and his wife Stephanie - his father Bernie Madoff admitted in a recent interview that the suicide of his son was all his fault and that the shame he has heaped on his family is the regret of his life

He was well known within Jewish circles in the Big Apple and his fraud hit many charities and individuals he knew for years.

However, during the course of the Politico interview he became annoyed at the suggestion that he singled out any particular group.

'I don’t feel any worse for a Jewish person than I do for a Catholic person,' he said. 'Religion had nothing to do with it.'

'I don’t feel that I betrayed the Jews, I betrayed people,' before adding, 'I betrayed people that put trust in me — certainly the Jewish community. I’ve made more money for Jewish people and charities than I’ve lost.'

During the course of the rare interview given at Butner, North Carolina, Madoff boasts that he 'has freedom to move about the compound, where the cells are not locked at night.'

He even goes as far to claim the prison is 'actually very pretty' and 'more like a college campus. Everything's provided for you.'

Rejected: Bernie Madoff said that since his wife, Ruth (pictured) cut him off along with his surviving son Andrew- his life has lost all meaning

Dead to him: Andrew Madoff no longer speaks to his father Bernie Madoff - a move which has left the Ponzi schemer struggling to find meaning in his life

Madoff even makes the claim that he never wanted his deception to go as far as it eventually did.

He said that losses he suffered in the early 1990s led to the Ponzi scheme in an effort to reduce the damage.

He said he 'wishes people could understand' it was never his intention to deceive his clients for so long.

  'I’d like to believe that there was something mentally wrong with me. It would make me feel better.' - Bernie Madofff on his weekly visits to a psychiatrist

'I don’t believe I’m a bad person. I did a lot of good for people. I made huge sums of money for some people,' he said.

'It wasn’t just for money. I already had huge amounts of money. It wasn’t to buy yachts or homes. I had that from the beginning from legitimate money I made.'

He added, 'There’s nothing to repent for. I already knew what I did was wrong.'

Ominously, Madoff also claims that he is convinced there is almost certainly another Ponzi swindler out there.

'There’s always going to be bad players like myself,' he said to Politico.

He also attacks politicians such as President Obama,  Hillary Clinton, Senator Chuck Schumer, Jersey Governor Chris Christie and New York City Mayor Bill de Blasio.

He claims to have grown weary of their 'never ending' requests for cash for campaigns when he was still thought to be wealthy.

'These politicians take money from anybody — Democrats, Republicans,' he said in what is his fifth interview since being jailed in 2009.

'I basically think everybody would be better off… if people weren’t able to exert so much influence on politicians with money.'

No big fan: Bernie Madoff said that he thinks the Hilary Clinton will make a terrible president and would not have voted for President Obama in 2012 because he is too socialist

Madoff claims that he voted for Obama in 2008, but now believes he is 'terribly disappointed' in the president and would not have voted for him a second time.

'His policies are too socialist.'

Warming to this theme he attacks New York Mayor Bill de Blasio, claiming, 'I’m not a great fan of redistribution of wealth,' Madoff says.

The fraudster also claimed he doesn’t think Hillary would make a good president.

'I certainly wasn’t impressed with her as secretary of state. Our foreign policy is a mess,' he said.

Politico points out that it wasn't that long ago that Madoff lived in a $10 million duplex penthouse on the Upper East Side of Manhattan and had access to a private jet and 55-foot restored yacht.

Now, he rises at 4am and is in bed by 8pm.

He passes the time by reading and watches hours of television and listens to radio news.

He says the food is alright but he reserves special disdain for the chicken fried race at Butner, which is in his opinion, 'horrible.'

Madoff makes about $40 per month keeping the living quarters clean as part of a five-inmate crew.

He refutes the recent reports that he has kidney cancer, but does admit that he has a form of kidney disease that is under control.

He says his recent heart attack was caused by a blocked artery but that he has had a stent put in place to correct it.

'I’m on so much medication — heart, kidney blood pressure,' he said. 'I never took a pill before I came here. Anxiety medication. I must take 14 different meds every day.'

He also visits a psychiatrist once a week - for all the good he says it does him.

'I can’t tell you how many hours I’ve spent with the psychiatrist — to try to make some sort of peace with myself, to understand how I did it,' he said.

'I’d like to believe that there was something mentally wrong with me. It would make me feel better.'

Madoff said he dreams of living a different life.

'I would go find myself an island somewhere with my wife, if she were willing to, and go fishing.' But he’s not sure Ruth would go with him. 'I don’t know. I would hope so.'
