A man who lost an incredible 390lbs just through good old-fashioned diet and exercise, and beat his chronic alcoholism without any treatment or support, has turned to a crowdsourcing website to help him with the final part of his journey.

Brian Flemming, a 32-year-old music teacher from Canton, Michigan, is now barely recognizable as the 625lb man he used to be - but his massive weight loss has left with him between 30 and 40lbs of excess skin.

'It's a constant reminder of my past and it gets in my way every single day,' Mr Flemming, who is asking for $22,000 in donations for skin removal surgery via GoFundMe, tells Daily Mail Online.

Aid: Mr Flemming, who hopes he can pay for his skin removal surgery with donations from his GoFundMe page, lost an incredible 390lbs through good old-fashioned diet and exercise

In a YouTube video to assist the campaign, Mr Flemming - who was at one point guzzling a fifth of vodka (25 ounces) every night and chowing through 'well over 7000 calories' daily - bravely removed his shirt to show viewers the extent of his excess skin.

'This is something I'm very uncomfortable showing,' he admits in the video. 'I don't go out in public like this, and I haven't gone swimming in over a decade because I'm too ashamed really.'

Mr Flemming says his rib cage sticks out as a result of it expanding to push his former weight away from his organs.

He also displays a lymphodema on his inner thigh, which used to be a 'pocket of fat' but has now detached from the rest of his body and will need to be surgically removed.

Before Mr Flemming began his weight loss journey, he was pre-diabetic and had been struggling with depression and alcoholism.

'My typical fast-food meal was a double cheeseburger with a large pop and large fries,' Flemming wrote on fitness blog Beyond The Miles.

'That usually wasn't enough, so I would have chicken nuggets with it as well. I also ate Arby's frequently. Large roast beef sandwich, large curly fries and drink, and a side of mozzarella sticks. I ate fast food every day,' he added.

In the spring of 2012, Mr Flemming was playing Draw Something, a Pictionary-inspired app, which randomly matched him with Jackie Eastham, a woman 20 years his senior in London.

He began chatting with Ms Eastham, who has myotonic muscular dystrophy, a condition that causes progressive wasting of the muscles.

To manage her condition, Ms Eastham follows an extremely healthy lifestyle, and never takes her well-being for granted. 

A friendship grew, and Mr Flemming began to confide in her about his weight problems, and about his drinking - a secret he had kept even from his parents.

He was expecting sympathy, and admits he was thrown by what was actually a brutally-honest response.

'She told me that I was wasting my life and that I should be ashamed that I was throwing it away when there are so many people out there who are fighting to stay alive, herself included,' Mr Flemming wrote.

On October 13, 2012, he made the decision to quit drinking cold-turkey, and to drastically change the rest of his life too.

New hobbies: In a bid to get fit, he began by simply walking in place for five minutes, then started running, and now, Mr Flemming in an avid cycler 

'Quitting alcohol was the most difficult step for me,' he tells Daily Mail Online, before advising that anyone else planning to stop drinking should consult a doctor about it first, because quitting cold turkey – like he did – can be incredibly dangerous. 

'I wasn't aware of how bad the withdrawals were going to be, so the first few days were like torture,' he recalls.

'I had cold sweats and couldn't sleep. I also found myself fighting extreme boredom at first and it really helped having Jackie to talk to.' 

Still, Mr Flemming managed to quit without the assistance of rehab or a support group, and has been sober ever since.

'I think AA is a great support for people, but it never really appealed to me,' he remarks, adding that he is an atheist.

'I'm not a spiritual person and I don't really like the idea of surrendering my will to a "higher power".

'I like to think that I am in control of myself and it is all up to me.'

Overhaul: 'I cut out all processed sugar and red meat,' says Mr Flemming, pictured before his weight loss. 'I limited myself to 1,400 calories per day for a long time'

Once Mr Flemming had kicked the bottle, he began to address the rest of his lifestyle.

'I cut out all processed sugar and red meat,' he says. 'I limited myself to 1,400 calories per day for a long time. It was difficult at first, but it taught me to choose foods that were low in calories, but filled me up. I ate chicken breasts and rice quite frequently.' 

In a bid to get fit, he began by simply walking in place for five minutes.

'I did it little by little,' Mr Flemming states. 'I started walking outside and could barely make it around the block and I added to that little by little. Eventually I walked my first mile.'

With Ms Eastham cheering him on by phone, Mr Fleming got to the point where he was walking five miles every morning.

'I dropped 100lbs over three months. It came off really fast. I was over 350lbs still when I started running in little increments at a time,' he says. 'The snowball was now rolling downhill and couldn’t be stopped,'

He also began cycling 44 miles to and from work every Friday.

Mr Flemming has since developed something of an 'addiction' to running, and his next goal is to run a full marathon.

Just friends? As for his relationship with Ms Eastham, and whether it ever turned romantic, Mr Flemming remains coy and simply says, 'we are very close'

Mr Flemming and Ms Eastham began a website and a Facebook group, Team 383, to motivate others to achieve their weight loss goals. 

'Brian has become a mentor and motivator to many throughout his journey and plans to continue paying it forward in the future, with the hopes of going back to school to become a therapist specializing in weight loss, depression and anxiety,' the GoFundMe page reads.

'If we manage to exceed Brian's goal, he has graciously offered to donate funds to Muscular Dystrophy charities in honor of his mentor.'

As for his relationship with Ms Eastham, and whether it ever turned romantic, Mr Flemming remains coy.

'I always tread lightly around this,' he says with a smile. 'We are "very close".'
