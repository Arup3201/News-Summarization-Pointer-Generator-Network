A professional poker player who owns 1,200 pairs of designer shoes, including 700 pairs of Christian Louboutins, is starting her own lower-priced footwear line.

Beth Shak, whose own shoe collection is valued at nearly $1million which she keeps in a password-protected closet, has decided to bring her love of heels to the masses, pricing her newly designed shoes between $160 and $190.

The 42-year-old told the New York Post: 'My almost-18-year-old daughter wasn’t happy having a mom that traveled and was gambling. She kept saying, "Why don’t you design a shoe line?" and one day I was like, "You know, she’s right."'

Earlier this year, Ms Shak's ex-husband, former New York hedge-fund manager Daniel Shak, sued her over her shoe accumulation, claiming she failed to disclose their value in their divorce.

The case was dropped however after his claim that he had never noticed her vast collection because of its 'secret room' location in their home in Bryn Mawr, Pennsylvania.

At the time, Ms Shak said with disbelief: 'He is saying he didn’t know the closet in our master bedroom existed'.

The mother of three, who started buying designer shoes in 2004, amassing her enormous collection in just eight years, said she treats herself to a pair of red-soled Christian Louboutins each time she plays a poker tournament.

One pair of custom-made black leather cowboy boots, once owned by the late Elizabeth Taylor, cost Ms Shak a staggering $7,725 at a Christie’s accessories auction last year.

With 25 sample pairs of her own footwear label already designed and manufactured, Ms Shak is now working on naming them.

One pair is named after her daughter, Lindy, with others labelled the Angelina, the Whitney and the Wendy.

'I essentially named my different shoes after anywhere from iconic women to women that meant something in my life,' she explained. 'The Wendy is for [TV talk-show host] Wendy Williams.'

One patent purple slingback heel, called the Elizabeth, will see proceeds go to the Children’s Hospital of Philadelphia, she said.

Her own shoe collection fluctuates because she often gives shoes away to charities, she said.

‘It
could go up to 1,400, or down to 1,100,’ she told MailOnline last month. ‘I don’t make a big 
deal of my philanthropy, but I’m always giving shoes away to charities.’

She recently donated a prized pair of bubblegum pink patent stilettos, made for her by designer Walter Steiger, to support the charity Wish Upon a Hero, on whose board she sits.

Ms Shak’s shoes will also have identifying marks, in the hopes that her own label will become as well-known and renowned as the signature red soles of her Louboutins.

She said: 'I have a signature bead buckle on a lot of my shoes that I’ve trademarked.

'On the bottom of each of my shoes... is a chubby little heart, so when you are walking, people can see the blue heart and know it’s one of my shoes.'

She added: ‘I don’t have any training as such, but 
I’ve always had an eye for things. I can walk 
into anywhere and I can pick out that piece.’
