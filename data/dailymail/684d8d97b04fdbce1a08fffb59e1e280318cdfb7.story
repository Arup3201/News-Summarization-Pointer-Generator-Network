Friends of the former Lib Dem chief executive said he was being 'lined up against the wall'

Lord Rennard, the peer accused of lewd behaviour towards female activists, could sue the Liberal Democrats, his lawyer said yesterday – as the party descended into open warfare.

Friends of the former Lib Dem chief executive said he was being ‘lined up against the wall’ and insisted he should not apologise because none of the sexual harassment claims against him had been proven.

They said if Nick Clegg attempts to remove the whip, or tries to get him thrown out of the Lords’ Lib Dem group, they will take the case to the High Court.

But the Deputy Prime Minister is set to up the stakes by proposing a second inquiry into the peer’s failure to say sorry for the alleged incidents. 

Mr Clegg issued his own grovelling apology to Bridget Harris – one of the 11 women who made claims against the peer.

She said he was ‘eating humble pie’ over his party’s failure to deal with the allegations, but that she no longer believed in his leadership. Lib Dem sources say they have been deluged by letters from angry members saying Lord Rennard’s refusal to apologise brings the party into disrepute.

A new inquiry could be announced as early as today by the Lib Dem disciplinary committee, leading to the peer’s whip being suspended. If not, his fate will be decided by a vote of the Lords’ Lib Dem group on Wednesday.

The Deputy Prime Minister said on Friday that Lord Rennard should not be allowed back into the party’s group in the House of Lords if he refuses to apologise.

But the peer has strong support in the Upper House and the Lib Dem leadership fears Wednesday’s vote could go against them.

One Lib Dem MEP, Chris Davies, has already pledged funds towards the cost of any legal action against the party leadership.

Lord Rennard’s alleged victims were 
incensed last week when party disciplinary proceedings were dropped. A 
QC investigating the 11 claims decided that, although they were 
‘credible’, they could not be proved beyond reasonable doubt.

However, the report by Alistair Webster QC recommended that Lord Rennard should apologise and change his behaviour.

The peer’s friend and legal adviser Lord Carlile warned the row could escalate. He told Sky News there was ‘no case’ against Lord Rennard and that he was ‘being lined up against the wall’.

Lord Carlile added: ‘If he has the whip removed from him then I have absolutely no doubt that Lord Rennard will be taking formal legal advice and the matter could unfortunately end up in the public law courts.’

In an article for yesterday’s Mail on Sunday, Lord Carlile even said Mr Clegg and the Lib Dem leadership made North Korea’s judicial system ‘seem benign’. 

Danny Alexander, chief secretary to the Treasury, pleaded with the Lib Dem Lords to refuse to allow Lord Rennard back into the party fold. The minister threatened a further inquiry, saying: ‘Party HQ has had a lot of complaints from party members about the fact that no apology has been made. 

‘Of course the appropriate committee will … decide what action needs to be taken because these are very serious matters.’

Lord Rennard wrote on Facebook at the weekend to say he had no intention of apologising, because he had done nothing wrong.

He added: ‘I tried to make/consider any apology years ago, but was totally rebuffed by the complainants. One accepted then reneged!’
