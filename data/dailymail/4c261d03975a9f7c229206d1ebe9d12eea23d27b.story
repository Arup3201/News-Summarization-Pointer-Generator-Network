Dramatic footage has emerged showing the killer Germanwings pilot learning to fly as a teenager years before the fatal crash in the French Alps.

Andreas Lubitz, 27, who deliberately crashed his passenger jet into a mountain killing all 150 on board, is seen laughing and joking as he takes off and flies a glider in Germany.

On the in-flight video, made around a decade ago, he can be heard saying 'right, here we go then' as he is towed aloft.

As he scans the horizon, he says: 'Why is it so quiet today? It is unbelievable.' 

He then jokes with his companion: 'We're going until we have no more fuel, okay?'

Up in the air: Dramatic footage emerged of the Germanwings killer co-pilot training around a decade ago

The 30-second video - obtained by ITV News and taken in Lubitz's home town of Montabaur near Frankfurt - was discovered as Germany continued to search for answers over the tragedy.

Lubitz went on to begin his training as a commercial airline pilot in 2007.

But he was forced to take a six-month medical break for depression and 'burnout' before finally qualifying as a first officer at Lufthansa two years ago. 

German investigators also found torn-up sicknotes and a 'small mountain of pills' in Lubitz's Dusseldorf flat which showed he had hidden the extent of his illness from his employers.

At least one of the medical certificates covered the day of the crash last Tuesday.

The 27-year-old was also said to be 'living on the edge' because he feared that his deteriorating blurred vision would cost him his pilot's licence.

Calls are now intensifying for doctor-patient confidences to be suspended for people responsible for the lives of others. 

Yesterday a British air safety expert said Lubitz was able to hide his medical problems because of a 'gaping hole' in the system for monitoring pilot health.

Under confidentiality laws rules, which also operate in the UK, patients do not have to tell GPs where they work and doctors are not able to tell employers about any health issues because of patient confidentiality.

The onus of reporting any health issues rests solely on employees. 

Tony Newton, a British pilot and Civil Aviation Authority examiner, said: 'It's a gaping hole. It would happen in the UK as well.' 

German prosecutors are expected to release fresh details today of their investigation  based on a weekend spent sifting through paperwork and computers seized from his home in Dusseldorf.

A special police commission of 100 officers codenamed 'Alpine Squad' is now working to try to establish the exact motive why Lubitz, 27, committed suicide and mass murder.

Prosecutors have confirmed he suffered massive depression, hid his treatment from his bosses and was having trouble in his relationship with live-in lover Kathrin Goldbach, 26, a schoolteacher who some reports in Germany claim is carrying his child.  

Police spokesman Andreas Czogalla said; 'This is certainly one of our biggest investigations for decades. All police colleagues are extremely motivated.' 

It came as chilling transcript from the aircraft's black box voice recorder revealed Lubitz responding 'hopefully' and 'we'll see' when he ran through in-flight landing checks with the captain of his doomed aircraft.

His responses came just a few moments before he encouraged Patrick Sondenheimer to go the toilet and took control of the flight.

Later Mr Sondenheimer is heard shouting 'open the god damn door!' as he desperately tried to break back into the cockpit. 

Passengers screamed as Mr Sondenheimer attempted to smash his way in with a crowbar after Lubitz locked him out and put the plane into a descent. 

But the only sound from the cockpit was Lubitz breathing as the aircraft plummeted at 3,500 feet per minute before smashing into the French Alps. 

After Mr Sondenheimer left him at the controls, he switched the autopilot from the cruising altitude of 38,000ft to 96ft – a move that was certain to crash the plane over the Alps.

The exchange was revealed yesterday as pictures of Lubitz as a child and a teenager emerged, and it was claimed his girlfriend may be pregnant. 

10.01am: Plane takes off from Barcelona 26 minutes late.

10.27: Reaches cruising altitude of 38,000ft. Lubitz tells captain Sondenheimer he can go to the toilet.

10 27-10.29: Sondenheimer tells Lubitz: 'You can take over.' Sound of a seat being pushed back and a click of the closing door.

10.29: The plane, flight 4U9525, begins its descent.

10.30-10.34: Loud bang, which sounds like someone trying to enter the cockpit.

10.35: 'Loud, metallic banging against the cockpit door' apparently as Sondenheimer attempts to break in with a crow bar.

10.37: Automatic warning sounds on flight deck, saying 'pull up, pull up' Sondenheimer shouts: 'Open the god damn door.'

10.38: The breathing of Lubitz can be heard in the cockpit but he says nothing.

10.40: Jet hits the mountainside with its right wing. The last sounds are screams from passengers.

10.42: French air navigation service sends out search and rescue teams.
