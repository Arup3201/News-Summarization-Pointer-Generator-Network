Four in 10 mums want politicians to stop banging on about Europe and focus instead on easing the pressure on family finances.

With four months until the general election, almost half of mothers already fear politicians will not keep their promises if they make it into power after May 7.

The latest edition of the MumDex by Asda reveals a growing disconnect between the supermarket's customers and politicians, with just a third willing to even open the door to a candidate on the campaign trail. 

The survey reveals 40 per cent of mums want politicians to focus less on the EU, with 53 per cent wanting to hear less about transport and 24 per cent keen to focus on issues other than childcare

More than half of do not think it will make any difference to their lives who wins the election

The MumDex survey of more than 3,000 of the supermarket’s customers nationwide reveals that many have low expectations about what the general election will bring.

Some 44 per cent said it would make little or no difference to their lives whoever wins the election, rising to 60 per cent in Northern Ireland.

More than half – 59 per cent – said they do not trust whoever is elected to actually implement the policies they campaign on.

While the survey does not mention party leaders by name, it will make for grim reading for David Cameron, not least the issues mums are interested in – and what to hear less about.

Forty per cent want to hear less about Europe a major blow to the Prime Minister who has pinned his hopes of re-election on the promise of an in-out referendum on Britain’s membership of the EU.

Despite the rise of Nigel Farage's Eurosceptic Ukip, 40% of mums want politicians to focus less on the EU. Labour leader Ed Miliband has vowed to focus on the cost of living and the NHS, which will chime with mums in the survey

More than half – 53 per cent – want politicians to talk less about transport. It comes after Mr Cameron and his Lib Dem deputy nick Clegg dashed around the country earlier this year to be pictured near roads earmarked for upgrades, with both posing at Stonehenge.

Surprisingly, 24 per cent of mums want less focus on childcare, perhaps a reflection of the way it has become pigeon-holed as a ‘female issue’, when women have much broader concerns.

Top of the list of priorities, according to the survey, is the cost of living, which 75 per cent of mums want politicians to focus on more.

Meanwhile 70 per cent named the NHS as a concern. Labour leader Ed Miliband has campaigned hard on both the squeeze on incomes and the pressure on the health service.

Immigration – regularly cited by Ukip as a key issue - was also a concern for 53 per cent of mums.

Asda’s Hayley Tatum said: ‘Almost half of Asda Mums are so dispirited that they don’t think that the election - whoever wins - will make any difference to their family’s lives; and, even more concerning, most of them don’t even trust politicians to honour their campaign

‘Mums still feel ignored, and they are not optimistic that this will change - they don’t have faith that this election will bring with it politicians and policies which speak to mums’ needs.

‘Despite this, they are not switching off - mums will still be following the election coverage online, on TV, and in print.

‘It’s very interesting to see that they would much rather read analysis of a candidate’s comments in the papers the next day than actually hear from the candidate directly.’

According to the survey only 33 per cent of mums are willing to listen to candidates who come to their door.

Almost half – 49 per cent – plan to watch the TV leaders’ debates, if they happen.

But two-thirds plan to get most of their information from online, TV and newspapers.

While 60 per cent of mums with teenagers plan to talk to them about the election, but only five per cent would want their children to go into politics themselves.
