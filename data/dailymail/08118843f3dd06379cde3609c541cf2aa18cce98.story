Every megastar worth their salt travels with an entourage and LeBron James is no except.

Since the basketball season ended in June, the sporting legend has been taking a well-deserved vacation, traveling around on Europe with not only finance Savannah Brinson, but also his mom Gloria James and an extended entourage of other hangers on.

Someone else who has blagged his way onto the all expenses trip is an obscure rapper who goes by the name of Da Real Lambo.

Nice work if you can get it: Da Real Lambo, 31, is currently dating LeBron's mom, 42, and clearly enjoying all the perks that come with being a member of the basketball star's inner circle

The 31-year-old from Miami, Florida, is currently dating LeBron’s mom, 42, and clearly enjoying all the perks that come with being a member of the basketball star’s inner circle.

Clearly an avid social media fan, Toyboy Lambo isn’t shy either about flaunting LeBron’s tremendous wealth, reports Black Sports Online.

His Instagram account is full of pictures of him living the high life as LeBron’s posse travels some of Europe’s most exclusive resorts including San Tropez, traveling by private jet and sailing the Mediterranean in a massive yacht.

The relationship between the rapper and superstar’s mom is clearly going very well.

As well as being invited on their European jaunt, other photos show Lambo hanging out in Miami with LeBron and his teammate Dwyane Wade on the beach and modelling LeBron’s latest championship ring.

In his caption to that particular pic, he explains that has to use two fingers to wear the ring.

Elsewhere he refers to Momma James as his ‘wifey’ and describes his potential stepson as his ‘role model’ - even though LeBron at 28 is three years younger than him.

Another photo shows the posse in Switzerland or ‘Swissland’ as Lambo refers to it in his caption.

Judging by the many photos that fill his Instagram account, he seems have settled in very comfortably to becoming a member of the James entourage who clearly been enjoying a fun-filled vacation.

Back in June, the Miami Heat were crowned champions for a second year in a row and James was named series MVP for the second year in a row.
