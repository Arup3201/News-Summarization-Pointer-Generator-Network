A 26-year-old man has been found guilty of sodomizing and strangling to death his girlfriend's four-month-old baby daughter in a horrific 2012 attack following just four hours of jury deliberations.

Jordan Lafayette Prince was convicted on Thursday of brutally sexually assaulting and murdering little Ashlynn Lillith Peters at his mobile home in St Charles, Missouri. He is now facing life in prison.

At a hearing earlier this year, Prince's girlfriend and Ashlynn's mother, Jessica Lynn Howell, 27, was jailed for 25 years after admitting felony murder and child abuse in relation to the infant's death.

Howell had encouraged her boyfriend to sexually assault Ashlynn in the sickening attack, authorities said. The helpless baby was then beaten and strangled by Prince, apparently to silence her crying.

On Thursday, Prince showed no emotion as he was convicted of first-degree murder, child abuse and forcible sodomy in the  killing of Ashlynn in December 2012, according to the St Louis Post-Dispatch.

His attorney had  argued that prosecutors had failed to prove beyond a reasonable doubt that Prince had hurt Ashlynn, claiming  no DNA belonging to the suspect had been found to support their claims.

Ashlynn was rushed to hospital on the morning of her death after being discovered lifeless and alone inside Prince's home in Deerfield Village. Despite medics' best efforts, she later died of her injuries.

Although her cause of death was ruled to be asphyxiation, prosecutors said the forcible sodomy - carried out with an unknown object - had caused enough internal bleeding to have killed her.

During Thursday's hearing,  assistant prosecutor Phil Groenweghe said Ashlynn's future hopes, dreams and achievements had been 'snuffed out' for 'one morning of sexual fun by this defendant'. 

Earlier in court, forensics expert Dan Fahnestock had testified that bloodstains found on the infant's blanket on the day of her assault and death were consistent with both the victim's and Prince's DNA.

But he admitted he did not know how or when the blanket had been stained. Meanwhile, medical examiner Dr Mary Case told the court Ashlynn's neck bruises were consistent with strangulation.

She also detailed the horrific injuries that Ashlynn had suffered during the sexual assault. They included severe blood loss that totaled around one-third of the infant's blood volume, STL reported.

During an interview with police, Prince, who had been dating Howell for around five months, reportedly told officers he had become frustrated with the baby because she wouldn't stop crying. 

Howell, who was apparently sleeping at the time, pleaded guilty in January to her involvement in her daughter's death. She also has two older children, a boy and a girl, St Charles Patch reported.

Shockingly, court documents said she had sent a series of text messages to her boyfriend - when Ashlynn was just one month old - encouraging him to have sexual contact with her baby daughter.

Prince  - who is not Ashlynn's father and was previously convicted in 2007 of lewd conduct with a minor under the age of 16 - will be sentenced by Circuit Judge Nancy Schneider on April 30.
