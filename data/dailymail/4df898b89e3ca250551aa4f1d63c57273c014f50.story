These are the horrific injuries a 17-year-old boy inflicted on an elderly lady with her own walking stick - before he raided her home for cash and jewellery.

Aaron Davis, of Hextable, Kent, has been jailed for more than ten years after assaulting 89-year-old Jean McDougall and leaving another pensioner for dead in a second robbery.

Mrs McDougall suffered serious bruising 
around her eyes, face and upper arm, a lip laceration, bleeding on her 
brain and a compression fracture to the top of her spine - which still 
causes her pain.

He beat one of his victims so hard 
that her false teeth came out and her glasses were broken. A court heard
 how Davis assaulted his frail victims on their doorsteps, before 
stealing their valuables.

Davis,
 now 18, had pleaded guilty at a previous hearing to three counts of 
grievous bodily harm with intent, two counts of robbery, the burglary of
 the first victim’s shed and another burglary at a  football pavilion. 
He was sentenced on May 6 at Maidstone Crown Court.

Judge
 David Griffiths QC ordered him to serve ten and a half years in a young
 offenders’ institution, also imposing an extended five-year licence 
period for the protection of the public.

He
 told Davis: ‘Your use of violence was gratuitous in the sense it was 
wholly unnecessary. You were intent on obtaining money because you 
wanted to show off to your friends.

‘It
 is quite clear that these were to some extent premeditated, targeted 
offences - targeted, in that you chose vulnerable, elderly victims.

‘On
 such victims you didn’t need to use violence at all because of their 
frailty, but you chose to do so as you went about pursuing your 
intention of relieving them of various items - cash and other personal 
belongings.

‘The use of violence against such victims was cowardly and likely to cause them serious injury.’

His first victim was 81-year-old June Carr, who he attacked on September 10 last year at the home where she had lived for 34 years.

The court heard he knocked on her front door, in a quiet cul-de-sac in the village of Hextable, at about 8am under the pretext of offering to do some work for her.

He then pushed Mrs Carr to the ground, causing her to hit her head and fall unconscious.

Leaving Mrs Carr for dead, Davis stole her son’s wallet and some other belongings from inside her house, before fleeing the scene, later returning to burgle her garden shed.

The court heard Mrs Carr lay on the ground for several hours before a neighbour found her, confused and delirious, and called for an ambulance.

She spent two weeks in hospital being treated for a fractured skull and two bleeds to the brain. In a victim impact statement, her sister-in-law told the court Mrs Carr now had no quality of life.

The statement said: ‘She doesn’t watch 
the TV or listen to the radio anymore. She just sits on the sofa all 
day. She doesn’t go out or interact socially.

'I’m on anti-depressants. Sometimes I do burst out crying and I do have flash backs of the man standing on the front doorstep'

‘She will never have the independence to go out on her own again. I don’t know what the future holds for June, but I do believe she will not get any better now.’

A month later Davis returned to the same cul-de-sac, this time targeting dementia sufferer John McDougall, 84, and his wife and carer Jean.

Davis knocked on their front door and spoke to Mrs McDougall, asking her the time, before leaving.

Later, having established his targets were elderly and vulnerable, he returned and this time demanded money.

Judge Griffiths said: ‘You then proceeded to inflict a cowardly physical attack on Mr and Mrs McDougall, at one point deploying a walking stick which you found on the premises.

‘Plainly they were in no physical state to resist your attack, which was gratuitous.

‘You made off with some of their personal
 items - jewellery and some cash - and a short time later you boasted to
 a friend about what you had just done.’

Mr and Mrs McDougall were found by a neighbour, covered in blood and seriously injured. The woman asked police that images of her injuries be shown to show the full severity of the attack.

Judge Griffiths said: ‘The psychological trauma inflicted on both victims inevitably was very substantial.’

In a victim impact statement read to the court, Mrs McDougall said: ‘I’m on anti-depressants. Sometimes I do burst out crying and I do have flash backs of the man standing on the front doorstep.

‘I would say I now feel 90 years, whereas before I felt about 60. My comfortable existence has been shot to pieces. If I hear a noise when I’m in bed I lie there terrified.

‘John is not well at all. He has lost 
about a stone in weight. He complains about his head being sore. He 
suffers terrible headaches. John and I are prisoners in our own home 
now.

'Your use of violence was gratuitous in the sense it was wholly unnecessary. You were intent on obtaining money because you wanted to show off to your friends'

Judge David Griffiths QC

‘I feel as if my life stopped on that day in October and now I have a new life which is full of worry and anxiety and difficulties.

‘The only time I had seen violence in my life was when I was in the Army serving in the Second World War. Apart from that I’ve had a good and happy life, which halted in October’.

Davis pleaded guilty to two counts of robbery, two counts of GBH with intent, one count of wounding with intent, and two counts of burglary.

The second burglary offence relates to a separate incident in the autumn of last year, in which Davis burgled a sports pavilion in Hextable.

Detective Constable Shelley Rainer of Kent Police, who led the investigation, said after the case: ‘This case involved an extremely violent assault on three innocent pensioners, for very little financial gain.

‘It is a case that has caused immeasurable damage to the victims, their families and the community they live in.

‘The victims’ courage in supporting the police has led to the successful conviction and prevented other offences in the future.

‘Despite the age of the defendant the judge has imposed a significant sentence that I think reflects the serious nature of the offences and also the threat that he poses to society.’
