A judge's wife compromised her position on a county school board by having affairs with two high-ranking bankers who were bidding for lucrative contracts, it was revealed today.

Jennifer Gottlieb resigned last year from her role as a Broward County School Board member after a pair of Citigroup bankers who did business with the school admitted to investigators that they had affairs with her.

According to Local 10, investigative reports reveal that Rick Patterson, of Tampa, and Michael Baldwin, of Orlando, financed millions in public 
bonds to build schools.

Florida Department of Law Enforcement 
investigators said 'Gottlieb at no time reported her relationship 
with [the Citigroup bankers] to the board and continued to cast votes on
matters concerning [Citigroup] that came before the board.'

The issue came to light following a Grand Jury investigation into corruption on the school board.

Grand Jury witness Pete Brewer said: 'I think it's a very bad issue of conflict of interest. She is evidently dating the guy and she's voting on his contracts, which is wrong.'

During interviews with investigators one of the Citigroup bankers broke down in tears, saying he and  Gottlieb were 'in love like high school kids' and had been a romantic item for three years.

Robert Jarvis, an ethics professor at Nova Southeastern University, said: 'You shake your head and you go, 'What were they thinking? In what universe could they have thought this was appropriate behavior?'

Reports suggest Gottlieb, who is married to a Broward County Judge, intentionally kept her affairs secret from the school by using pre-paid phones to make calls to her lovers and using  personal email addresses.

Mr Jarvis said because Gottlieb had actively taken the decision to 'conceal and defraud the public the issue was a criminal, not an ethical matter.

However, neither the Florida Department of Law Enforcement or the grand jury took the decision to indict Gottlieb because there is not a law forbidding voting on public matters that involve intimate friends.

Gottlieb is alleged to have conducted covert trips to the airport, had secret meetings with the men and spent days in local hotel rooms.

According to Local 10, reports indicate that Gottlieb knew that what she was doing was wrong.

Following the revelations her husband filed for divorce in June this year.
