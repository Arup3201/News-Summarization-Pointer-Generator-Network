The Indiana mother who - along with her boyfriend - overdosed on heroin in a McDonald's play area they were at with their children was sentenced Monday to six months behind bars.

Tamica Lynn Jeffers, 33, and boyfriend Robert Palmer, 37, was were arrested march after the fire department in Green Township responded to a call about two unresponsive adults.

Jeffers was sentenced to six months in jail, with 90 days suspended and given credit for 44 days served only one week after Palmer received a similar punishment, according to WXIX.

Authorities said Jeffers was unconscious and not breathing, and Palmer was conscious but unresponsive. They eventually recovered from what police say were 'life-threatening overdoses' of heroin.

Authorities say the couple admitted taking the drugs while with a five-year-old girl and an eight-year-old boy they had brought to the play area.

Attorney Michael J. Trapp said Palmer hopes to serve his time and then begin picking up the pieces of his life.

'My client is very sorry that this happened,' Trapp said after the sentencing.

Prosecutors said in court he showed little appreciation for the seriousness of his actions. He will get credit for time served since his arrest, meaning he has a little less than five months left in jail, but it is not known if he had the last half of his sentence suspended similar to Jeffers'.

Multiple MailOnline attempts to reach local authorities for clarification were not successful.

After the overdoses, the McDonald's franchise owner and operator in suburban Green Township said he was proud that the restaurant crew and its customers took quick action to respond to the emergency and call 911 for medical help for the couple.
