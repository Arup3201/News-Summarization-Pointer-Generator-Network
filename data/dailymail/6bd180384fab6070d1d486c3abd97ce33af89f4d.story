The Premier League returned with a bang last weekend with thrilling games, spectacular goals, breath-taking skill and plenty of drama.

And for the thousands of you already signed up MailOnline's brilliant Fantasy Football game, those vital points are already racking up.

But if you're a bit slow off the mark, or have simply been on holiday, it's not too late to pick your dream team and join the chase for £60,000 of cash prizes available this season.

Your dream team: It's not too late to enter the MailOnline's brilliant Fantasy Football game and perhaps win a share of the £60,000 prize pot - including 38 weekly prizes of £1,000 for the top performer that weekend

Points winner: Selecting Chelsea players in your team was a wise move over the opening weekend as the Blues won 3-1 at Burnley to take an early lead in the Premier League table

Good pick: Arsenal's new £30m signing Alexis Sanchez looks set to be a big points-earner this season

High flyer: Those with Man United's Wayne Rooney in their team would have been celebrating his goal

For one thing, even if you make your picks now, remember we've only had one set of Premier League matches - you've got another 37 glorious weekends to catch up.

And it takes just one top performance over the course of a weekend to scoop our weekly £1,000 Grand Master prize.

Kevin Brown from Ashford in Middlesex, the manager of 'To Hull and Back', pocketed the first of these prizes after amassing a whopping 231 points - thanks in no small part to using all 16 of his transfers.

So if you fancy a bit of that or think you can do better, it's not too late to get involved and spend your £100m war chest on the team to beat all teams.

Who knows, you could even be the one walking away with the £10,000 grand prize come the end of the season!
