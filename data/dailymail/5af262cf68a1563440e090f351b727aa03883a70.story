Two brothers from Canada have come up with a novel idea - a book so small you need an electron microscope to read it.

Teeny Ted from Turnip Town, currently the world's smallest book, is a reproduction of a 30-page tale that fits on the width of a human hair.

The reproduction, which is printed with pure crystalline silicon, cost a staggering $15,000 (around £9,250) to create.

The book's exact measurements are 70 micrometres by 100 micrometres. The  pages, which are too small to be read even using a microscope, are printed on a single tablet

A single word from the world's smallest book - Teeny Ted from Turnip Town by Malcolm Douglas Chaplin

It was written by Malcolm Douglas Chaplin and published by his brother, Robert, at the Simon Fraser University, in British Columbia, Canada.

The book's exact measurements are 70 micrometres by 100 micrometres. Its pages, which are too small to be read even using a microscope, are printed on a single tablet.

Teeny Ted's story, Robert Chaplin said, is one of triumph - where the main character wins an annual turnip-growing contest.

Following the minute book's inclusion in the Guinness Book of Records, Robert, who works as a fine artist, then raised enough money via a Kickstarter campaign to create a large print version of his brother's story.

Robert, from Vancouver, Canada, wrote on his Kickstarter page: 'In 2007 I was permitted access to a focused ion beam and scanning electron microscope at Simon Fraser University.

'In my time working with this equipment I designed and published an original work on a microchip, as an array of 30 tablets. 

'The tablets contain the text of 'Teeny Ted From Turnip Town' complete with an ISBN. 

'In 2012 I received a Guinness World Record confirming my creation of the smallest book yet made.'

The original, tiny version of the book has the ISBN reference number ISBN-978-1-894897-17-4.

Robert said: 'Through my practice as a fine artist I met Karen Kavanagh at the [Simon Fraser] university's physics department, who was intrigued by my carvings and drawings.

'We decided I would be a good fit to work on a project together at the nano lab.

'Malcolm had written the story of Teeny Ted as a diversion from a dull undergraduate economics paper sometime in the late 20th century.

'I revisited the idea, and decided that I would use the text to design and publish the world's smallest book.

'I was pleased with how the book turned out.

'Everyone likes Teeny Ted: its simultaneously creative non-fiction and a success story.'

The book is printed pure with crystalline silicon and cost a staggering $15,000 (around £9,250) to create

The original, tiny version of the book even had its own ISBN reference number (ISBN-978-1-894897-17-4)
