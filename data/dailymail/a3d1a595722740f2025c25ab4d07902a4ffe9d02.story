Authorities say the man tied to at least eight murders from New York to Alaska killed people simply because he 'liked to do it.'

Israel Keyes was found dead in his Alaska jail cell on Sunday after he had apparently committed suicide, but not before he confessed to killing a Vermont couple who disappeared last year,

Officials said at a news conference in Vermont on Monday that Keyes, 34, provided details about the abduction of Bill and Lorraine Currier that authorities had not released to the public.

Dead: Israel Keyes, 34, was found dead in his jail cell on Sunday morning in an apparent suicide

Revelations: Police say that Keyes confessed to killing Bill and Lorraine Currier, pictured, who have not been seen since June 2011. He also said that he sexually assaulted Mrs Currier before strangling her

Tristram Coffin, U.S. Attorney in Vermont, said during a news conference on Monday: 'He provided some motivation, but I don't think it's really [possible] to pigeonhole why he did this.'

Mr Coffin added: 'It was something that he could control and he liked to do it. Why someone likes to act like that, nobody knows.'

Officials say he broke into the Currier's home, tied them up and forced them into their car.

He then drove them to an abandoned house in Essex. Authorities say both the Curriers tried to escape.

Keyes then shot Bill Currier with a gun he had stolen from the couple's home and sexually assaulted and strangled Lorraine Currier.

Their bodies have never been found.

He was found dead in his cell Sunday, authorities said at a news conference that included U.S. Attorney Karen Loeffler, the FBI, and Anchorage police.

Authorities wouldn't say how he killed himself, only that he was alone in his cell. An autopsy will be conducted.

Keyes flew from Alaska to Chicago with the intent of kidnapping and killing someone, drove to Vermont and picked the Curriers, a couple in their 50s, at random, officials in Vermont said.

He told police he broke into their home, went into their bedroom, bound them with zip ties and forced them into their car.

He then drove them to an abandoned house and tied Bill to a stool in the basement, while Lorraine Currier tried to escape, Chittenden County state's attorney T.J. Donovan said. 

Discovering this, Keyes ran out and tackled Lorraine, and Bill then tried to escape.

He shot Bill Currier with the gun he had stolen from the couple's home, and then sexually assaulted and strangled Lorraine Currier, Donovan said, his voice breaking.

Their bodies have never been found, and Keyes did not volunteer the information.

'They fought to the end,' Donovan said, adding that they showed 'extraordinary bravery and love for each other.'

Keyes could have faced the death penalty for the murder of 18-year-old
Samantha Koenig, a barista who was abducted from the Anchorage coffee kiosk that she worked in last 
February.

He was later arrested in Texas after using Miss Koenig's debit 
card.

Keyes also indicated he 
killed four others in Washington state and one person in New York state,
but did not give the victims' names, authorities said.

The
FBI contends that Keyes killed Miss Koenig less than a day after she was 
kidnapped.

Keyes was thorough and methodical in disposing victims, authorities said on Sunday.

Koenig's
body - which was pulled from an ice-covered lake north of Anchorage in 
April - is the only Keyes victim whose remains have been recovered.

A
surveillance camera showed an apparently armed man in a hooded sweat 
shirt leading Koenig away from the coffee stand.

Koenig's friends and 
relatives established a reward fund and plastered the city with flyers 
with her photo in hopes of finding the young woman alive.

Prosecutors
said Keyes stole the debit card from a vehicle 
parked near her home, obtained the personal identification number and 
scratched the number into the card.

After 
killing Koenig, Keyes used her phone to send text messages to conceal 
the abduction, according to prosecutors.

He flew to Texas and returned 
February 17 to Anchorage, where he sent another text message demanding 
ransom and directing it to the account connected to the stolen debit 
card, according to prosecutors.

Keyes made 
withdrawals from automated teller machines in Alaska, Arizona, New 
Mexico and Texas before his arrest in Texas, according to prosecutors.

Koenig's family said there was no apparent previous connection between the teen and the suspect.

Reached by phone Sunday, Koenig's father, James Koenig declined to comment on Keyes' death.Marilyn Chates, Bill Currier's mother, told The Associated Press that police contacted her some time ago to tell her about Keyes' confession and to tell her that they believed the couple's killing was random.

Certificates of presumed death were issued over the summer and a memorial service was held in late summer, she said.

Vermont authorities called Chates on Sunday to tell her of Keyes' suicide.

'After some thinking, our family has been saved the long road ahead - trials, possible plea agreements and possible appeals – and perhaps this was the best thing that could have happened,' she said from her home in Florida Sunday evening.
