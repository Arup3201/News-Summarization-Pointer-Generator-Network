A Massachusetts police officer has been sacked after shouting a racial insult at Boston Red Sox star Carl Crawford.

The black outfielder was signing autographs before a game in New Hampshire when he was branded a 'Monday' by a heckler in the stands.

The comment was traced back to off-duty officer John Perreault, who has a history of being racially offensive, Leominster Mayor Dean Mazzarella said.

The term 'Monday' can be used as a racist statement towards African-Americans and in some cases is tantamount to calling them a 'n*****', according to the Urban Dictionary.

It comes from the common dislike for the first day of the working week and is often used in the hope the abused person will not be aware it is an insult.

In a letter informing Perreault of his decision to fire him, Mazzarella said: 'Your actions are so egregious that severe discipline is warranted.

'There is simply no place for your behavior in the workplace and there is no place for someone who exhibits such objectionable behavior in the Leominster Police Department.'

Mazzarella's decision comes a day after Police Chief Robert Healey recommended during a disciplinary hearing that the mayor fire Perrault, saying he'd used racial slurs at least twice before.

Perreault's attorney, Joseph 
Sandulli, said his client would either appeal through the civil service 
commission or file a grievance through the police union. Sandulli said 
Perreault didn't intend the word as a racist insult and the city 
overreacted.

'He was criticizing Crawford for being a bad player, not because he was a black man,' Sandulli said.

A Red Sox spokeswoman said the team would have no comment on the decision.

The term 'Monday' has several meanings.

It is associated with the idea that Monday is the most-hated day of the week.

But it is also used as a derogatory term for blacks and can be as offensive as using the word 'n*****'.

It is often employed in the hope the victim will not be aware they are being insulted because it is such a mundane word.

According to Urban Dictionary, it has been used in a routine by Canadian comedian Russell Peters in which he says: 'Damn it, that Monday over there stole my car!'

Perreault had been on paid leave since he called Crawford a 'Monday' before a July 5 minor league game in Manchester, N.H.

Crawford was playing with a Red Sox 
minor league affiliate while rehabilitating a wrist injury and Perreault
 attended the game while off duty.

After Perreault taunted Crawford, the outfielder notified stadium officials.

In the termination notice, Mazzarella cited previous alleged racist 
remarks by Perreault, including when he repeatedly used a racial slur in
 a bar while watching black NBA players.

In another instance at Leominster's 
St Patrick's Day celebration, Perreault saw a black man wearing a shirt 
displaying the name of the Irish beer Guinness, and commented to him 'I 
didn't know they serve Guinness in Africa.'

Mazzarella said Perreault's Facebook 
page also contained racially insensitive content and said the officer 
had even referred to his Monday comment as 'priceless' on there.

Sandulli said two superior officers 
with Perreault at the parade clearly didn't consider the remark improper
 because they didn't report it, even though they're obligated to report 
anything that violates department rules.

He said Perrault's alleged remarks at
 the bar were hearsay because the city relied on a written statement and
 never produced the witness for questioning.

Also, Sandulli said, almost no one at
 the hearing, including Perreault, was previously aware that Monday can 
be used as a racist term.

'He feels strongly he didn't mean the
 comment in a racial way, and he's not a racist, and he wants to 
establish that,' Sandulli said.

But Mazzarella didn't believe Perreault's explanations.

'In arriving at this conclusion, I 
did not check common sense at the door,' he wrote, adding the word 
Monday was 'certainly directed at Mr Crawford's race.'

Perreault is considering an appeal.
