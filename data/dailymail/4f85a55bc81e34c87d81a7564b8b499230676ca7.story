Cold: Denitra Green allegedly drove away as her cohort stole Jay Z tickets from a seller they'd connected through on Craigslist. The seller clung to their car and was dragged, disfigured and then run over

A Houston man was disfigured and nearly killed when the women he was selling Jay Z tickets to sped away as he leaned into their car, leaving him clinging desperately to the door handle.

The unnamed victim begged Denitra Green and Cessica Darden, both 20, to stop the car but police say Green continued speeding away while Darden kicked at his hands in an attempt to get him to fall off.

As Darden's baby sat in the backseat, Green continued to drive after the car ran over the man's nearly lifeless body.

According to the Houston Chronicle, 
Darden had told the victim they'd need to meet in a parking lot, with 
her in the car, because she was unable to leave her young child.

Court documents indicate that the man held on to the speeding vehicle at the back seat, right beside where Darden's child sat.

'[Darden] kicked his arm so hard, they broke it,' the victim's attorney Andino Reynal told KTRK. 'It was a clean break. He's going to have to have surgery. When the arm broke, he came off the car and the car ran over his legs.'

The man broke a leg, an arm, tore a knee cap, and suffered disfiguring facial wounds.

'He was begging them and instead of stopping, they drove faster,' Reynal said.

He will in all likelihood live out his life with diminished use of his right hand and one of his legs.

The
 man remained in the hospital Thursday in the wake of the devastating 
December 15 incident and faces plastic surgeries and the possibility of 
never regaining the use of some fingers thanks to extensive broken bones
 and horrific road rash.

Horrific: The unidentified victim will require plastic surgery and may never fully regain the use of his right hand or one of his legs. He suffered a broken arm, leg, and horrible road rash on his face

Horrified witnesses gave the police the car's license plate number.

The victim was also able to provide the contact information the women had used leading up to their meeting.

But
 they were led to the suspects by way of something far more shocking: 
police went to the December 19 concert and found them in seats matching 
those for which the victim had been selling tickets on Craigslist.

The witnesses and victim would later identify Green in a lineup. She was then arrested.

Police
 said the women admitted to the crime and showed no remorse even after 
being shown pictures of the grisly injuries they allegedly caused the 
man.

Green has now made her $30,000 bond. As of Thursday evening, Darden remained at large.
