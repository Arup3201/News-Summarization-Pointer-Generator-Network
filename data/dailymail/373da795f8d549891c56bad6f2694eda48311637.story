There is little fanfare as Jamie Roberts poses patiently during a photoshoot in the Place du Trocadero, where crowds gather for the best views of the Eiffel Tower.

In the Welshman’s adopted city, locals instead pine for the likes of Edinson Cavani and Zlatan Ibrahimovic, who fill out the Parc des Princes for Paris Saint-Germain.

An altogether more impassioned reception can be expected if Roberts braves the streets of Cardiff between now and Friday night. The 28-year-old is at the heart of head coach Warren Gatland’s plan for the RBS 6 Nations opener against England and Welsh expectations are high for the dress rehearsal for September’s World Cup Pool A match.

‘It’s going to be a game of chess,’ says the Racing Metro centre. ‘It’s going to be really intriguing to see how we approach the game and find each other out. Ultimately, it’s 80 minutes of complete warfare. When you’ve played against England, it’s serious, car-crash stuff — hugely physical — and it’s a battle royal for us.’

Over a coffee and a pizza in Paris’s 16th arrondissement, Roberts talks up the buzz of a Test week back home, singling out the 30-3 victory over England in 2013 as his stand-out memory in a Wales jersey.

He recalls the moment five minutes before full-time when he turned to winger Alex Cuthbert and said: ‘Mate, tonight’s going to be big,’ as well as the pride of playing in front of family members and childhood friends.

‘It was a magnificent day,’ says Roberts. ‘You grow up loving the rivalry between England and Wales, in whichever sport. It’s not hatred, that’s taking it a bit far, but there’s a certain loyalty to your Welsh mates. The history is there and that makes the occasion so special. You revel in it.’

Twelve of the starting XV who played in that Test against England have been named in the line-up for Friday’s kick-off. There is a feeling of familiarity when Roberts returns to camp in the Vale of Glamorgan, particularly when the squad is blessed with a clean bill of health as it is for this year’s competition.

It is a stark contrast to the situation at Pennyhill Park, where a growing injury list has left the England camp scratching heads over a few new combinations.

‘Experience counts for more than a settled squad,’ says Roberts. ‘Having players with 30 or 40 caps is worth a lot in a World Cup year because these games are of big importance. It’s key that we don’t freeze, and Test experience counts for a lot.

‘It buys you an extra second on the ball and lets you read things a bit quicker in defence. If you’ve got 14 or 15 guys who have been through that together — experienced wins and losses together — it stands you in good stead.

‘Jonathan Davies and I have the record centre partnership for Wales and we know each other’s game inside out. That gives you confidence going into any game.

‘The fact that England maybe haven’t worked out their combination gives you a bit of a lift, but it can also prove to be dangerous. That uncertainty, players fighting for positions, can be a wonderful thing.’

Both Roberts and Davies now play in France’s Top 14, although they struggled initially after making the switch. Large budgets in the French league mean bigger squads, and playing opportunities are subsequently limited. There were reports near the end of 2014 suggesting Roberts wanted to return to Cardiff Blues but he insists he wants to see out his contract and is looking forward to working alongside big-money signing Dan Carter next season.

Roberts lives in an apartment on the Left Bank of the Seine with morning training a 25-minute scooter ride out of town. It is a cosmopolitan lifestyle for the qualified doctor, who admits he misses the mental challenge of the medical studies that he completed in 2013.

Racing have been doing well domestically and in the Champions Cup, with the Parisians beating Northampton convincingly at Franklin’s Gardens last week.

Roberts came out on top in his run-out against Luther Burrell, the Saints and England centre. As defensive captain for both club and country, he is responsible for setting the line-speed and ensuring his team-mates stick to pattern.

The rush defence takes a well-weighted pass or an elusive running line to undo — which England may find difficult with their new combinations.

In attack, Roberts is at the heart of the physical ‘Warrenball’ approach. It is hard-hitting and often criticised for being belligerent, but it is becoming an increasingly common Test strategy.

‘It’s about balance,’ says Roberts. ‘Being able to play on the front foot is so valuable in international rugby. My role is to get defences back-pedalling, to give us more time in attack.

‘Rugby is about going forward and it will never change. With the space that is afforded to you, that’s normally through the heart of teams, rather than around them.

‘The game isn’t like it was in the Sixties when you passed the ball to the winger and he scored in the corner off first phase.

‘You have to go forward and look at weak spots, which a lot of the time are in the opposition 10 channel. That’s where we like to play the game.’

Roberts will be sent down the channel of England fly-half George Ford on Friday night; that much is no secret. It has all the makings of a happy homecoming.
