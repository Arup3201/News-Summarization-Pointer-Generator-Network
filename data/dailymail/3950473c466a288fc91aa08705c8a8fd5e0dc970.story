The biggest ever leap in the standard of the 'three Rs' has been pledged by Education Secretary Nicky Morgan.

Mrs Morgan will this week set out ambitious plans to rocket England to the top of the European league tables for reading and maths by 2020 – and become fifth best in the world.

At present England lags back in 26th place in the world for maths and 23rd for reading.

'Three Rs': At present England lags back in 26th place in the world for maths and 23rd for reading

Mrs Morgan says the dramatic rise in literacy and numeracy – which will be a cornerstone of the Tory manifesto – can be achieved by driving up standards in the 'three Rs' – reading, writing and arithmetic.

Under a future Conservative Government, all 11 year olds will be expected to:

If Mrs Morgan fails to live up to her bold promise, she can expect to pay a heavy price.

Former Labour Education Secretary Estelle Morris was forced to resign in 2002 after she made a similarly bold declaration – and failed to deliver. 

However, Mrs Morgan – one of the rising stars of the Government – has given herself some wriggle room by saying that she will be judged on whether she has met her target by tests in 2021, one year after the next Parliament if, as expected, it lasts until 2020.

At present Shanghai, China is top of the world league in maths, followed by Singapore, Hong Kong, Taiwan and, in fifth place, Korea. The Netherlands are 10th, Germany 16th, Australia 19th with France one place ahead of England at 25th.

To leapfrog Korea into fifth place, the standard of maths in England would have to increase by a huge 12 per cent.

It is a similar story in reading with Ireland 7th, Estonia 11th, Australia 14th, Germany 20th, France 21st and England 23rd.

The tables are dominated by Asia, in particular provinces of China – which breaks down its entries because of its size.

The pledge by Mrs Morgan amounts to her first major policy announcement since replacing Michael Gove as Education Secretary last July. 

She will be keen to make her mark on the department after being called 'U-turn Nicky' for reversing some of Mr Gove's policies such as snap inspections of schools to root out Islamic extremism and relaxing rules on taking children out of school in term time.

Education is expected to be a key Election battleground, with polls indictaing that Labour and the Conservatives are neck-and-neck on the issue.

As part of the new drive, Mrs Morgan will also toughen up existing tests in the 'three Rs' for all children when they leave primary school.

And there will be stiff sanctions for schools which do not meet Mrs Morgan's standards: those which fail to ensure all pupils master the basics of English and maths for two years in a row will be forced to become academies free of town hall control, or join up with local high-performing schools.

At present only one in four state schools are academies.
