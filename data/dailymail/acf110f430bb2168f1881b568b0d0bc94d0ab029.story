Honeymooners: British actress Kate Winslet and her new husband Ned RocknRoll have already been embroiled in a battle with locals over plans for new gates at her 15th century

No doubt she hoped that moving to the countryside would provide her with a peaceful start to her third marriage. 

But Kate Winslet has already found herself embroiled in a battle with locals over her plans for a set of new wooden gates at her 15th century home in a sleepy hamlet.

The 37-year-old actress has lost the fight following objections to her proposals to install the 2metre-high gates (just over 6ft 6in) at the £1.95million property she moved into just weeks ago.

Miss Winslet, who has been honey-mooning at the house, has now been forced to withdraw her application to the parish council.

It is understood she wanted the imposing gates to protect her privacy, but she was accused of trying to impose ‘suburban’ values on the home she shares with husband Ned RocknRoll.

Several of her neighbours attended a meeting in the village hall at which they expressed their concern that the design of the gates was out of character.

The hamlet – so rural that it does not even have street lights – has become one of Britain’s most exclusive areas because of its picturesque scenery.

One neighbour said of the plans: ‘People are very protective of the village. They are not the sort to gawp. Some have said that if she wanted that much privacy she shouldn’t have bought a house like that.’

Another added: ‘It’s very different from New York and Hollywood here. I’m sure everyone there has these great big gates and I think it’s probably what Kate has been used to, but there’s no need to come here and do that.

‘I don’t know what to think, quite honestly. The gates were totally out of character. We are in an area of outstanding national beauty and they just weren’t in keeping with the surrounding area.

‘If you put gates up, you are just drawing attention to something. If you live  normally, no one is going to think a thing.’

Titanic star Miss Winslet, who previously lived in New York, has returned from America permanently to make a home with Mr RocknRoll, Sir Richard Branson’s nephew, who changed his surname by deed poll from Abel Smith.

The property is just a few miles from the home Mr RocknRoll shared with his  ex-wife Eliza Pearson, the daughter of  Viscount Cowdray.

Miss Winslet has a 12-year-old daughter Mia from her marriage to director Jim Threapleton and a son Joe, nine, from her marriage to director Sam Mendes.

One reason she is said to have moved  to the area is because of the standard of local schools.

The parish council said of the plans: ‘These gates and adjoining fencing are considered to be a prominent, visually intrusive and incongruous feature more suited to a suburban or urban area than this rural setting.’

The council added that while Miss  Winslet’s house is not a listed building, it ‘should be regarded as a heritage asset’.

It went on: ‘The hamlet lies in a very sensitive, tranquil, unspoilt and rural location.

‘Any development should be  compatible with its location and reflect local style and vernacular design.

'The parish council object to the proposed high oak solid gates.’

Neighbours were unsure whether the actress would re-apply with a new design for the gates, although one said: ‘I hope they don’t try again.’

Miss Winslet married last month in America in a romantic and private ceremony attended by only a handful of family and friends.

It is thought to have taken place at a resort in the Catskill mountains in a heated barn with a rather hippyish country-chic vibe.

The ceremony is understood to have been brief and very simple, with the venue filled with wild  flowers in jam jars and pretty coloured lanterns.

In November the actress received a CBE from the Queen at Buckingham Palace for services to drama.

She won a best actress Oscar for her performance in the 2008 film The Reader.
