A man was charged $27,000 for chicken parmesan and two beers at a Tennessee restaurant after a card machine glitch added extra zeroes to customers' bills on October 21, one as high as $99,000.

James Morgan, 22, never expected to leave Chop House in Knoxville with a full stomach and an empty bank account but last Friday he noticed a very suspicious charge of $27,000 on a bill that should have been $27.

'Just having everything kind of stripped away from you,' said James Morgan of how it felt to notice the card error.

Only using cash: James Morgan said he might consider ripping up his credit and debit card and only payong his bills in cash for fear he'll lose even more money 

He says he's never had something like this happen to him before and that he's considering ripping up his debit card and only using cash.

'I'm considering just using cash now instead of using my credit card, debit card, just to make sure,' he said.

'I was just kind of in shock of the whole thing. I've never been in that situation or anything like that happening to me before,' he added.

Morgan isn't the only customer who got overcharged that night and some were stripped of even more cash for their meal. 

WATE spoke with a customer who said she was charged $80,000 for her dinner and her account is thousands of dollars in the red.

The CFO of Chop House's parent company, Nicki Dawson, told WATE that the overcharge was due to a problem with the company's card processor.

When the charges showed up last Friday, customers began calling the restaurant in panic.

Dawson said the glitch only affected customers on October 21 and that the restaurant is working on getting all of the charges reverse red.

They've also agreed to pay patrons any overdraft fees they may be accumulating. 

Customers incorrectly paid anywhere from 8,000 to 99,000 .
