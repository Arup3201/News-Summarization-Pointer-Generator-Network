Madeleine Albright and Conan O'Brien went head-to-head in a Twitter battle on Thursday - and the former U.S. secretary of state definitely had the last laugh.

The war began after the comedian wrote: 'I picked out my Halloween costume. I'm going as 'Slutty Madeleine Albright.''

Albright, 77, was quick to respond with her own dig, writing: 'I'm considering going as hunky Conan O'Brien - but that might be too far fetched.'

Don't mess with her! Conan O'Brien learned the hard way never to mess with former secretary of state Madeleine Albright after she quickly put him in his place with a serious of clever Twitter jabs

The response made O'Brien chuckle and he added: 'YES - My first twitter war with a former Secretary of State! You're next, George P. Shultz!'

Albright, who has more than 70,000 followers on Twitter to O'Brien's 12.5 million, then schooled the talk show host on the ways of the world.

'Never get into a word war with a diplomat,' she told him. 'We talk even more than comedians.'

And with that, Albright was declared the winner.

'Damn,' the 'Conan' host responded. 'Whenever I go toe to toe with @Madeleine Albright, she always wins.' 

Battle: O'Brien eventually declared Albright the winner of the battle and they agreed it was 'all in good fun'

'Ha, you're certainly not the first to that mistake,' she responded. 'But all in good fun!' 

He should've known better than to mess with Albright. 

She became the first woman to serve as secretary of state when she took over the role in 1977 under the Clinton administration, has a PhD from Columbia University, works as a professor at Georgetown University and was awarded the Presidential Medal of Freedom, among other achievements.
