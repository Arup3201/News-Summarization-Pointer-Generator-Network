The European Union will crumble if it does not return half of its powers to members states, former French president Nicolas Sarkozy has said.

Sarkozy, who is once again campaigning to lead the country, claims ’the system will explode’ if the EU continues to work in its current Brussels-centric form.

The 59-year-old said the EU should only deal with industry, agriculture, competition, trade negotiations, energy and research.

Nicolas Sarkozy claims the EU will 'explode' if Brussels do not hand back 50 per cent of its power

Speaking from Mulhouse, near the German border, as part of his campaign to become leader of the UMP party once more, Sarkozy said: ’Europe must give back 50 per cent of its competences to member states.’

’If not, the system is going to explode.’

‘I no longer believe in the possibility of changing things in Europe from the inside,’ he told the audience according to The Times.

Sarkozy has promised that, if he is re-elected as president in 2017, that he will withhold all French business with the EU until Brussels meets his demands for reform.

This follows his controversial promise to ‘repeal’ Socialist legislation allowing same-sex unions.

'They have this much power': Sarkozy, who is once against attempting to win the French Presidency, said the EU should only deal with industry, agriculture, competition, trade negotiations, energy and research

Sarkozy is set to regain the leadership of the conservative UMP party, and the remarks came during a debate in Paris between the three candidates hoping to lead the conservative UMP party into the 2017 presidential election.

He said the May 2013 law which legalised gay adoption ‘should be written from the ground up’.

The predominantly right-wing audience chanted ‘Repeal! Repeal!’, and Mr Sarkozy said: ‘If you prefer that I say repeal the law, it comes down to the same thing.’

Mr Sarkozy did nothing for homosexuals who wanted to marry during his single term as President between 2007 and 2012.

The vast majority of French people are at least nominally Catholic, and there has been huge opposition to President Francois Hollande’s liberal social policies.

However, an Ifop poll published on Saturday showed 68 per cent of the French were in favour of same-sex unions.

It also showed that 53 per cent of the country supported adoption by homosexual couples.

Despite facing a long list of corruption enquiries, Mr Sarkozy is convinced he can become head of state again in three years.

He has increasingly placed himself to the right of the political agenda, mainly in response to the increasing success of the far-right National Front.
