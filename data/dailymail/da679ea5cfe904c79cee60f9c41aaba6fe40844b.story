Mother: Diane Ash-Smith (pictured in October) gave her son Colin, 46, an alibi for the murder of 16-year-old Claire Tiltman in 1993, claiming he had been driving her home after dropping off leaflets

A  schoolgirl's killer has been jailed for life after he dodged justice for two decades because his Labour Councillor mother provided him with a false alibi.

Former milkman Colin Ash-Smith, 46, was told he would serve a minimum of 21 years behind bars today after being convicted of murdering Claire Tiltman in a 'barbaric' attack in 1993. 

Ash-Smith chose not to attend Inner London Crown Court today to hear his fate.

Judge Mr Justice Sweeney said Claire had an 'engaging and lively personality' and was 'extremely popular, with a wide circle of friends.' 

'I have no doubt that this was a premeditated murder that you carried out because of the feeling of power that it gave you.

'In so doing, you not only ended Claire's young life which was so full of promise, but you also caused unbearable grief and upset to her family and friends.

He added: 'This was a premeditated murder. Your intention was to kill. You took a knife to the scene for the purpose, and Claire was vulnerable by reason of her circumstances.' 

Today's sentence means Ash-Smith will be 67 before he is considered for release. 

Described in court as his mother's 'golden boy', the knife-obsessive had gone to his 16-year-old victim's funeral in the same clothes he wore when he stabbed her in an alleyway.

His parents, Diane and Aubrey, were friends with Claire's through the local Royal British Legion club – but that didn't stop Mrs Ash-Smith, who later became her town's mayor, from providing her son with an alibi for the murder.

At first she claimed he had been driving her home after dropping off leaflets, but Ash-Smith later changed his story to say he was at home instead.

His mother then used her position as a councillor to obtain information about the murder inquiry, quizzing detectives about a car seen in the area that matched her son's.

Mrs Ash-Smith later admitted on TV that she had ordered her husband, who was also a Labour councillor, to dispose of a knife when their son was first questioned by police. Mr Ash-Smith was jailed for six months in 1997 for perverting the course of justice, after cutting up and boiling a blade which he later dumped in a bush. His wife was acquitted of the same charge. Police believe that Ash-Smith, who was obsessed with Jack the Ripper, may have stalked more than 100 women, and planned 'hundreds' of attacks before he was caught.

Detectives found a chilling diary of his 'assault plans', in which he described his first attempted murder at the age of 20 as a 'masterpiece'. He also described plans to kill at a care home and railway station.

He was jailed for life, serving a minimum of 15 years, in 1996 for two terrifying knife attacks. At the time, Mr Justice Wright warned: 'You are far too dangerous to be at large.'

Nevertheless, Ash-Smith was on the brink of being released when he was charged with Claire's murder this February, having served 18 years. He was initially imprisoned after kidnapping a school cleaner at gunpoint in 1988. He attempted to rape her and strangle her with his school tie, which tore in half, before stabbing her several times in the back.

The 27-year-old survived after rolling down the banks of a quarry to get help. 

Guilty: Yesterday former milkman Colin Ash-Smith, 46, (left) was finally convicted of murdering 16-year-old Claire Tiltman (right) in 1993. Claire was on her way to a friend's house in Kent birthday when Ash-Smith, then 24, pounced, stabbing her nine times and leaving her to die in an alleyway

Ash-Smith was also convicted of stabbing 21-year-old Charlotte Barnard 14 times in 1995, just 300 yards from where he had killed Claire two years earlier. This time his victim's life was saved by her puffa jacket, which stopped the knife from damaging vital organs.

He later joked in prison that he could not join a darts team because he always missed his target. He was arrested hours after that attack, at the home he shared with his girlfriend Stella Murrell. The knife he used to stab Miss Barnard was recovered at the house – but although he also became the prime suspect for Claire's murder, police could not prove his guilt due to his alibi.

Miss Murrell later told officers that Ash-Smith would practise 'play' attacks on her. She was forced to marry him in prison by his parents, who threatened to leave her homeless. 

Jurors shook their heads as Ash-Smith described how he regularly went on night patrols scouting for victims, saying: 'I was an animal.'

He continued to deny Claire's murder, and was only caught after confessing to a prisoner that he had attacked a woman he saw on a zebra crossing – a reference to the schoolgirl.

Yesterday the killer betrayed no emotion as he was convicted at Inner London Crown Court after a five-week trial.  

Around a dozen of Claire's school friends today packed into the public gallery to hear the sentence read out.

The judge commended Claire's family and friends who sat through the trial, and the police for their work in bringing her killer to justice.

He said: 'I would also like to commend the members of Claire's family and her friends who have attended this trial for the dignified way in which they have conducted themselves.

'And I express my sorrow for the burden they have had to carry for many years at Claire's untimely loss.

'The efforts of Claire's family and friends kept her murder in the public conscience, and thanks to the recent re-activation of the inquiry by Kent police, further evidence came to light and you have finally been brought to justice.'

Claire was on her way to a friend's house in Kent four days after her 16th birthday when Ash-Smith, then 24, pounced. He stabbed her nine times and left her to die in an alleyway.

Tragically, Claire's parents Cliff and Linda never lived to see her killer brought to justice. Mr Tiltman died of cancer in 2012, four years after his wife succumbed to the disease. Shortly before his death, he said: 'We know [Ash-Smith] did it, the police know he did it. I just wish he would've confessed to it all those years ago and saved us all this agony. Lin ... asked me on her death bed to get justice.'

Friends who launched a 'Justice for Claire' group wept yesterday. One said: 'We will never get Claire back and we will never forget her. But now both she and her beloved parents can finally rest in peace, knowing her murderer has at last been brought to justice.'

Ash-Smith was branded 'pure evil' by police, while prosecutors said he got a 'warped pleasure' out of attacking women. 

Mrs Ash-Smith, 66, had been set to testify at the trial as a character witness, but never appeared. Kent Police would not comment yesterday on whether she would face charges following her son's conviction.
