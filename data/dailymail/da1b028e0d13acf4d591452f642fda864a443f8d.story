An airplane carrying 150 terrified passengers nearly crashed at Cologne airport in Germany after the pilots were almost knocked unconscious by toxic fumes in the cockpit.

And budget airline Germanwings – a subsidiary of Lufthansa – has now been accused of deliberately playing down the frightening ordeal in a bid to avoid an investigation.

The near-fatal crash on 20 December 2010 was reported to the air safety authorities. However, an investigation was not launched.

Germany's Die Welt newspaper then teamed up with broadcaster NDR to dig up reports on the potential catastrophe.

The two pilots were crippled by nausea and were barely conscious as flight 753 from Vienna began its descent into Cologne. 

The 26-year-old co-pilot told the captain, 35 years old, to land the airplane as his arms and legs went numb and he reached for an oxygen mask.

The captain's own hands and feet then started to tingle as he took control of the airbus.

He began to get tunnel vision and became badly dizzy as the Germanwings plane hurtled towards the runway at more than 400 kmph.

According to a medical examination afterwards, the captain had a blood oxygen level of just 70 per cent and his co-pilot's was less than 80 per cent. Healthy people have a blood saturation level of around 100 per cent.

The petrified captain said he feared for his life.

According to Der Spiegel magazine in Germany, the pair successfully landed the airplane and were taken away in an ambulance, watched by passengers.

Germanwings submitted a report to the German Federal Bureau of Aircraft Accidents Investigation. However, the incident did not appear in the BFU’s monthly bulletin and no further action was taken.

Experts only received new information on the near-fatal crash a year later by which time the black box and cockpit recorder information were no longer available.

A spokesman for Germanwings told Die Welt that there had not been a problem.

But the newspaper said it had seen a medical report from Lufthansa referring to an examination of the co-pilot six months after the incident. It said he was fully capable of service - after six months of being incapable.
