Petty: Eldridge Dukes, 56, is facing attempted manslaughter charges after shooting his teen son in the buttocks in a fight over orange juice

Shots were fired at a Sunday morning breakfast after a father and son got into a fight when the orange juice ran out.  

Police in Baton Rouge, Louisiana, say 58-year-old Eldridge Dukes is facing a charge of attempted manslaughter after he confessed to shooting his 18-year-old son during the argument, according to The Advocate. 

Investigators say the squabble escalated when the victim broke a vase, and Dukes grabbed his handgun.

They say Dukes chased the victim out of the house and down the street, firing at least three times. 

Police say the son was hit in the buttocks and suffered non-life-threatening injuries.

Dukes was booked into the parish prison on counts of attempted manslaughter and illegal use of a dangerous weapon.

Jail officials couldn't provide the name of a defense attorney to comment on the charges. 

Public records show Dukes was booked for the charges on March 22 and is being held on $60,000 bail
