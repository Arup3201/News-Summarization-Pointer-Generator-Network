WIN journalist Lincoln Humphries has joined the ranks of Australians posting pictures of themselves in the hopes of winning $10,000 in an online competition to find the 'hottest selfie'.

The competition, run by Brisbane-based company Serious Selfie, offers the cash prize for the most likes on a photo, and has attracted hundreds of photos from men and women all around the country, including Humphries.

The journalist has a different take on the competition than most, posting a photo of himself pulling a face similar to a recognisable meme where two animals appear to be pulling the same expression.

Under the caption 'Hey bebz, Vote 4 me. Xox', Humphries originally promised that he would use the $10,000 prize money on a 'sweet party for everyone', and a pug dog, but decided to put the money towards charity if he won.

Some entrants have taken a similar tack to Humphries, poking fun at the selfie competition

The journalist garnered media attention earlier in the year when he refused to take part in the ice bucket challenge, when a private video that showed Humphries, on the set of WIN news, urging viewers to ‘stop wasting ice’ and donate to charities helping areas with water shortages instead. 

'I saw the competition and thought it was novel, a bit strange,' Humphries told Daily Mail Australia.

'I thought it would be pretty funny to enter, and obviously enough people agree with me there. I think there are always things we can take less seriously, and this is one of them.' 

Several Facebook users suggested Humphries employ some of the tactics used in many of the Hot Selfie photo entrants.

'Maybe you should get your cleavage out and go a little heavier on the eye makeup and pouting? You are also an 11/10. Just got accentuate your assets there, Linc.' one user posted. 

Another wrote, 'The very nature of the competition will attract luvvoes, who think they're hot s**t, and who love to strike a pose for their own camera. Can't imagine any of the contestants are very deep or complex individuals.' 

So far, entrants into the competition include cast members from Australia's production of musical Grease, Gretel Scarlett and Bobby Fox - who recently recorded a song with model Miranda Kerr. 

Currently Humphries' selfie has 256 likes on the Hot Selfie competition page, behind Rochelle Wilkie, who has 520 likes who is in the lead.

'I'm a bit concerned about the stiff competition,' he joked. 

On his Facebook page, Humphries wrote 'Currently some sheila with genuine narcissistic principles is winning this, so-called, 'Hot Selfie Competition.' That's a bit lame.'  

Rochelle, who entered after being prompted by her sister, said that if she won she was going to donate half of the money to the Royal Perth Hospital ICU where her father was hospitalised recently for two months after complication from catching pneumonia.

'I want to say thank you for the work they have done over the past months,' Rochelle told Daily Mail Australia.

'It was physically and mentally draining for my Mum and myself, but the support we had from his nurses who watched him 24 hours a day was incredible.'

'I know it isn't a lot but a little can go a long way.'

'Everyone that knows me, knows that I love taking a selfie whether it be a smile, duck face or pulling a horrible face that only my mother would love. I think it's awesome to see people take enough pride in themselves and how they look to share it online for everyone to see.' 

Rochelle said she had seen Humphries selfie, and not only thought it was funny, but voted for it to win.

'His photo is awesome, I love it. I actually voted for his photo and commented suggesting he donates the money to Royal Perth Hospital if he wins,' she said.

 Australian residents over the age of 16 can enter and entrants have the option to enter one selfie for $4.99 or three selfies for $9.99

Humphries has promised to donate the money to the charity of choice of the person who's suggestion on his Facebook garnered the most likes, which he referred to as 'democratising the donation'.

'I'm interested in who is actually financing this debacle. Where is the $10,000 coming from?' he asked. 

The WIN journalist said that he wished the best for Rochelle, especially considering her father's recent health issues. 

'At the end of the day, if the money helps someone, that's a great thing.'

A spokeswoman for Serious Selfie said the snaps were so legitimate these days that they could launch careers.

'From bikini a day to Australia’s Next Top Model, selfies are forging careers for would-be models and lifestyle bloggers,' she said. 

Rochelle said that some of the money might go towards paying off her credit card and costs from her 21st birthday celebrations next weekend.

'I think at the end of the day regardless of what people say, everyone loves a little attention (after all that's why we take selfies) so it doesn't bother me at all,' she said.
