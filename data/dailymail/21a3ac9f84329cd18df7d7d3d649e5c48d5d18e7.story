A suspicious girlfriend's plot to catch out her lover backfired spectacularly when the honeytrap she hired ended up running off with him herself.

Samantha Phipps, 26, decided to test Jack Ewing's loyalty after finding a sexy text from another woman on his phone.

She spent £200 on the services of a 'Miss Honeytrap' and arranged for her to meet her boyfriend in the pub.

The plan was to see if the undercover female could entice Mr Ewing, 32, into a sexual encounter and then arrange for the pair to meet another time, at which point Samantha would confront him.

Unfortunately for Samantha, the tryst last November was a success as the honeytrap informed her that they had kissed and planned to meet at a hotel a few days later.

'She gave me all the details of where they’d be meeting and asked if I wanted to go' said Samantha, an administrator from Bristol.

'I was heartbroken. He’d fallen for her so easily, but of course I said yes.'

Mr Ewing - who started going out with Samantha in January last year - left the home the couple shared the following day and didn't come back for the whole weekend.

Samantha sent him a text pleading with him to respond and he replied with: 'I've gone and I'm not coming back'.

She turned up at the hotel on the day when Mr Ewing was supposed to be meeting the honeytrap, but he wasn't there.

Samantha spent the rest of the week crying before eventually going out on a Friday night to drown her sorrows.

Painful: Samantha caught the woman and her boyfriend in a bar and flung a drink over her

But her anguish turned to sheer torment when she saw customer services manager Mr Ewing in the same bar with Miss Honeytrap, also known as Jane Gill.

Samantha told the Daily Mirror: 'I asked what the hell she was doing and looking really nervous she said sorry, that it had just happened.

'She looked down at her drink and admitted they were seeing each other. Jack didn’t seem bothered at all.

'So you’re telling me I set you up to test my boyfriend and you stole him from me?

'I completely lost it. I flung my drink over her and she started crying.'

Mr Ewing, who has since moved out of the couple's home, said he feels 'quite good about what happened', adding: 'I’m happy with Jane.'

Miss Gill, 26, who has since given up her honeytrap job, said she and Mr Ewing were 'well-suited'.
