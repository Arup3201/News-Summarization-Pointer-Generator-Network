Daniel Sturridge will be treated by medical experts at the Boston Red Sox baseball team over Christmas in an attempt to solve the injury problems that have ruined his season.

The England star has not played for Liverpool since August after suffering thigh and calf problems, depriving Brendan Rodgers of his first-choice striker after the departure of Luis Suarez.

Sturridge has been training in Los Angeles because the club thought that he would benefit from a change of scenery.

It is unclear what specialised treatment Sturridge will receive at the Red Sox — who share the same owners, Fenway Sports Group, as Liverpool — that is not available on Merseyside.

But the fact that the Anfield medical team are going to such lengths to get to the root of Sturridge’s persistent muscle injuries emphasises the growing concern over the problem.

The 25-year-old was injured just three games into the new season when he suffered a thigh strain in September while training with England for the Euro 2016 qualifier against Switzerland.

Sturridge pulled a calf muscle in his first full training session back with Liverpool’s first-team in October and then picked up a fresh thigh injury in November that has ruled him out until the new year.

Rodgers revealed last month that the former Chelsea striker has suffered nine separate injuries in his left thigh alone during the course of his career.

Sturridge suspects the problems are hereditary because his father Michael, who was a trainee at Birmingham, and uncles Dean and Simon, both former professional footballers, struggled with similar issues during their careers.

In his absence, Fabio Borini, Mario Balotelli and Rickie Lambert have brought just two league goals
