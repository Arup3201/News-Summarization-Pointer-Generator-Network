Salford have signed former Leeds hooker Liam Hood from Championship One club Hunslet for the 2015 season.

The 22-year-old burst onto the scene for the Rhinos in 2012, scoring three tries in five appearances for the club, but was released 12 months ago and joined the Hawks.

On the move: Former Leeds hooker Liam Hood will join Salford for the start of the 2015 Super League season

Salford coach Iestyn Harris said: 'Liam comes with a great pedigree in rugby league.

'He's come up through the ranks of the academy at Leeds Rhinos and shown he's worthy to play in the first team on many occasions for them.

'We're hoping Liam will be able to recapture his form in the top flight of rugby league and continue as one of the emerging talents in the game.'
