The dead rubber victory against India on Friday was Alastair Cook's last cricket of the summer, the England and Wales Cricket Board has revealed.

Cook, who is not in England's Twenty20 squad for Sunday's one-off game against India, is the only player who has been made completely unavailable for the rest of the season.

The under-fire England captain has played all of England's seven home Test matches this year, as well as eight of their nine completed One Day Internationals. 

Rested: Cook will be given time off ahead of England's World Cup preparation in Sri Lanka

Long summer: The England captain has endured a difficult season with the bat before eventually recovering

Questions: Cook's batting saw his captaincy questioned in both forms of the game in which he leads England

Positives: The England captain was able to celebrate a personal, and team, turnaround against India

Cook has also featured occasionally for Essex this summer, but the ECB have decided to give the 29-year-old the rest of the season off.

Bowlers James Anderson and Steven Finn have been given one game back with their counties, but the ECB have asked that the fast bowlers not play in the final game of the season to aid preparation for the tour of Sri Lank.

Meanwhile many of the batsmen, including Moeen Ali, Joe Root and Gary Ballance, have been given full availablity to their county.

County star: Ian Bell helped Warwickshire win the Natwest T20 Blast and can play in the One Day Cup Final

Available: Moeen Ali, who impressed with his batting and bowling, is one of 12 players made available

All the England stars will be allowed to play in the Royal London One Day Cup Final if their team have reached it, with Ben Stokes, Chris Woakes and Ian Bell likely to feature.

However, Bell will not be able to play a part in Warwickshire's outside chance 

for the County Championship title, with the Cup final his only possible remaining appearance.
