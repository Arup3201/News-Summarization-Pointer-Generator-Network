Two teenage girls knocked down and killed by a car in the early hours of yesterday may have been murdered.

Jasmine Allsop, 14, and her friend Olivia Lewry, 16, were hit yards from the younger girl’s family home, apparently after attending a party.

Police were yesterday questioning a 20-year-old man, who is understood to have known both girls, on suspicion of their murder.

Friends: The girls, named locally as Olivia Lewry (left) and Jasmine Allsop (right), were hit by a car in Gosport

The girls were hit by the Honda Civic 
around 20 yards from the terraced house in Gosport, Hampshire, as they 
walked home at about 4.15am.

Jasmine – known as Jas – died at the scene, while Olivia was taken to hospital with severe injuries but died later yesterday.

Friends
and neighbours gathered yesterday near the scene of the tragedy to 
mourn the pair. Jazmine Bates, 16, said: ‘They were lovely, bubbly girls
and everyone around here knew them.

‘They
were best friends and were always together. It’s so sad. Everyone is 
shocked and I don’t think anyone can believe what has happened.

‘They
were good girls and easy to get along with. They didn’t have any 
enemies. They were loved by everyone. ‘There will be a lot of tears.’

Sasha Ewing, also 16, said: ‘They were happy girls who were always out with mates and having a good time.

‘It’s
such a shock - one minute they were here and now they are not.’ 
Blonde-haired Jasmine attended Brune Park Community School in Gosport, 
while Olivia had recently started studying for her A-Levels at St 
Vincent College in the coastal town.

Damien
Bannon, 19, who knew both girls, said: ‘I believe the girls had been to
a party and were standing outside the house talking when the car hit 
them. The driver was a friend of theirs. ‘I still can’t believe it. It’s
such a tragedy.’

Mr Bannon,
a decorator, said Jasmine’s older brother Reece was ‘distraught and 
angry’ at her death. ‘He was very fond and protective of his little 
sister,’ he added.

Arron 
O’Sullivan, 28, said: ‘This is such a tragic waste of young lives, 
especially so close to Christmas. I’m still shaking because of the 
shock.’

Schoolfriends who 
asked not to be named described the girls as ‘bubbly, outgoing, and 
extremely popular.’ One said: ‘They loved being the centre of attention 
and were very sociable. They were always listening to popular chart 
music or dubstep.’

Meanwhile devastated neighbours laid flowers at the scene and spoke of their shock.

A
message on one bunch said: ‘In love and memory of Olivia and Jaz. 
Thinking of you. Lots of love Regan, Taylor, Kayleigh and Tom.’

Family 
friend Victoria Berry, 45, who lived opposite Jasmine’s former Gosport 
address, described the teenager as an ‘absolutely gorgeous girl’.

She 
added: ‘What has happened to her and her friend is an absolute tragedy 
and a huge loss to all that knew and loved her.

‘It’s hard to believe that I’ll never see her again.’

On
Facebook, Chelsea-Lee Evans wrote: ‘I can’t imagine how hard it is for 
all of your family and friends. I love you both and R.I.P my angels.’

Tara Hebberd posted: ‘2 beautiful girls have lost their lives. R.I.P Jas and Olivia sleep tight.’

Forensic officers have been at the scene gathering evidence where the two girls were hit

The
street was cordoned off by police yesterday as scene of crime officers 
in white overalls examined the scene, marked with yellow and red cones.

Detective
Superintendent Dick Pearson, from Hampshire Constabulary, said: ‘This 
is an extremely tragic incident which has resulted in the death of two 
young girls.

‘I currently 
have a team of detectives and other officers, including expert road 
collision investigators, working on this case to fully investigate the 
circumstances surrounding the deaths of these two teenage girls.

‘I would appeal to anyone who knows anything which could help this murder investigation to contact my team as soon as possible.’
