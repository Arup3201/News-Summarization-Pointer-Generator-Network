A High Court judge yesterday warned residents living on Europe’s largest illegal traveller site that they cannot expect to get what they want by breaking the law.

The stinging rebuke came as Mr Justice Ouseley presided over the latest legal attempts by travellers to stop the bulldozing of Dale Farm.

The news also came as it was revealed the legal battle over Dale Farm has so far cost taxpayers at least £1.6million.

Since 2005, Basildon Council has 
spent at least £1.41million on court cases, bailiffs and other measures.
This does not include officer time additional costs. 

However, the authority cannot collate its costs for barristers at 
numerous public inquiries and enforcement action over the site between 
2001 and 2004 when the problem began.

Plans to start the £18million eviction were scuppered when three separate judicial reviews were lodged at the High Court.

After a judge gave them a stay of execution earlier this week, inhabitants of the Essex site triumphantly declared they would be still be living there in 30 years.

But yesterday Mr Justice Ouseley said: ‘It is not always possible to get what they most want, especially when what they most want is to go on committing a criminal offence.’

He added that the travellers were faced with two options – move into housing, or ‘take risks on the roadside’. He continued: ‘Whatever choice they make cannot be visited on an authority endeavouring to uphold the law.’ One of the applications has been brought by Mary Sheridan, who claims being evicted would be a breach of her human rights.

Although Basildon Council has said the travellers can apply for accommodation, her barrister Marc Willers argued that it had an ‘obligation to facilitate the gipsy way of life’.

He added that if the case went to the European Court of Human Rights, the travellers were likely to win.

But Reuben Taylor, acting for the council, said allowing them to escape eviction would ‘strike to the very principles of the rule of law’.

Those who refused to leave 51 illegal plots at six-acre Dale Farm were originally due to be removed on September 19, but bailiffs were blocked by a last-minute injunction.

Even if the latest judicial review applications fail, the travellers are due to return to the High Court next week. They will argue that the council’s plans are ‘over-enforcement’.

Meanwhile, the Dale Farm divas were enjoying their 15 minutes of fame as they strode into the High Court for the latest episode in the legal fight to stop travellers being evicted from the site.

The power-dressing girls were in London, showing their support in the fight to allow travellers to stay at the camp in Basildon, Essex.

The McCarthy sisters - Joanna, 38, Tina, 40, Margaret, 46, Kathleen, 50, and Marie, 55 - attracted the attention of the judge at court last week when they wore matching blue and pink floral-print blouses to show 'solidarity'.

After Mr Justice Edwards-Stuart praised 
their 'lovely turnout' and said they 'brightened up the court' last 
week, they were back today to show off a wider variety of styles.

Indeed they were so dressed to impress that there was speculation they could be hoping to star in an offshoot of the reality show My Big Fat Gypsy Wedding.

Three of them teamed midi-length black skirts in a jersey fabric with colourful tops.

The two blondes wore fashionably striped T-shirts - one with a nod to last week's florals - while another was dressed in an pink, ruffled top with black piping and her hair pulled back in a chignon.

One was clad in sandals in a nod to the unseasonably fine weather while her two sisters opted for demure Mary-Jane black courts.

Another McCarthy fashionista paired black leggings with a black and leopard print top.

All of them glowed with a healthy tan as the travellers arrived for the latest episode in their decade-long battle with the courts - which has been condemned by some critics as a 'farce' - and which could cost in the region of £18million.

And the girls brought a posse of female friends with them - all dressed for the occasion - to show their support for three separate applications for judicial review following the official eviction date last week.

Many of the women at court were in bright pink, with one sporting a multicoloured bag, black mini and pink socks peeping over knee-high black boots.

Another came in one of the high-impact floral blouses, but toned down the look by throwing a grey cardigan over the outfit.

The first challenge today was brought by Irish traveller Mary Sheridan.

Her counsel, Marc Willers, said the case had an 'extensive history' but Ms Sheridan was not claiming she should be allowed to stay at Dale Farm 'forever - or indeed for many years, or even a year'.

Mr Willers said: 'This claim is 
brought on this basis: there is no alternative, suitable accommodation 
at this point in time, and it would be disproportionate to be forced to 
leave in the absence of such accommodation.'

It was not being suggested that Ms 
Sheridan felt she had any hope or prospect of being granted planning 
permission at Dale Farm in the future.

The
judge heard the other claims for judicial review would raise several 
other legal issues under human rights legislation and planning law.

The hearing is now expected to take at least two days.

According to Basildon Council leader Tony Ball, the wheels of justice were 'grinding slowly' but 'going forward'.

Welfare: It was argued that there had been a failure to give the interests of children, like Gaffer Flynn, 2, living on the site primary importance

He said: 'We will be back in court 
tomorrow afternoon and again on Monday and the judge has indicated there
will be a judgment by Tuesday at the earliest.

'As
I have said before, it has taken 10 years so far, and we now know the 
vast majority of British people support us, and we can wait a few more 
days for justice to be done.'

According
to a YouGov poll, two-thirds of the British public support the 
council's attempt to clear the 51 illegal plots at six-acre Dale Farm - 
home to about 400 travellers.

residents unsuccessfully applied to English Heritage for official 
protection status for the scaffolding gateway at the site entrance.

Battle: There are already indications that the travellers are confident of securing at least six plots

They say it has become an 'emblem of the struggle for travellers' rights'.

Today, Mr Justice Ouseley was at first presented with two judicial review applications, but a third was swiftly added.

In
the first challenge, the judge is being asked by Ms Sheridan to quash 
the council's decisions to carry out evictions on the grounds that they 
violate the travellers' Article 8 rights to family and private life 
under the European Convention on Human Rights.

Mr
Willers said Ms Sheridan was the daughter of Mary Flynn, another Dale 
Farm resident who lost a recent Court of Appeal attempt to block the 
council's use of direct action to clear the site. Her failed application
was based on her poor health.

Mr
Willers argued the personal circumstances and medical conditions of 
several Dale Farm residents meant council decisions to continue direct 
action against them was unreasonable and legally flawed.

He also argued there had been a failure to give the interests of children living on the site primary importance.

The
council had failed to comply with its obligations under section 11 of 
the 2004 Children Act to safeguard and promote the welfare of the 
children.

Mr Willers argued there had been no proper consideration of the impact of eviction on their physical and mental health and emotional well-being.

Even if their latest judicial review application fails, the travellers are still due to return to the High Court next week.

They will then argue before Mr Justice Edwards-Stuart that the council's plans to go to the site to demolish hard standings for caravans and remove buildings, walls and fences will amount to 'over enforcement', not covered by the enforcement notices.

There are already indications that the travellers are confident of securing at least six plots.
