Clearly a morning person, one Melbourne commuter spent their train ride practising their dance routine.

Clearly believing he was out of sight of all the other passengers, the man strutted along to non-existent music, swinging his umbrella as he went.

All the while, an unseen commuter quietly captured the moves on his phone.

Clearly believing he was out of sight of all the other passengers, a Melbourne practised his dance routine on a train while an unseen commuter quietly captured the moves on his phone

'Because I've never met a guy like him before, he makes me feel so special inside,' the anonymous dancer recited.

'I think I'm in love.'

Donning a pair of sunglasses and a smart black suit, the dancing man thrust and swung while walking down the train isle in silence.

He even managed to throw in some impressive fist pumping as well as swinging off the train’s poles.

Meanwhile, the other commuters remained oblivious to the routine being performed , with one person absorbed in their book and another distracted by his head phones.

With a final impressive hair flick, the dancing man ended his routine by exited stage right.
