The fate of Luis Suarez should become clearer before the start of the Spanish league season after the Court of Arbitration for Sports (CAS) said it would try to hear the appeal in early August.

Barcelona have pressed for a fast-track hearing to determine the length of his ban following the Uruguayan's bite on Italy's Giorgio Chiellini during the World Cup, which stands at four months.

They will contend and barter that his nine-match international ban with Uruguay should still stand but that the four-month domestic ban from 'any football-related activities' should be reduced.

The Spanish league season begins on the weekend of August 23-24, so any hearing would need to be earlier than this if Suarez's appeal was to be finalised before the beginning of a new campaign. 

In a statement, the court said: 'It is likely that a final award will be rendered well before the end of August.'

FIFA must also agree to the fast-track procedure for it to be heard early.

CAS says no hearing dates have been set and that no arbitrators have yet been appointed to hear Suarez's case. 

Suarez moved to Barcelona for £75million this summer from Liverpool.
