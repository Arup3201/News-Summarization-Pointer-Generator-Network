Nearly two thirds of Germans think they would be better off if they had not swapped the Deutschmark for the euro.

This is the largest number ever to voice doubts on the single currency since it replaced the building bloc of the postwar 'economic miracle' a decade ago.

Some 65 per cent of Germans thought their personal situation would be better if they still had the D-mark, compared to 36 per cent of French who miss the franc, according to the survey by Germany's Bertelsmann Foundation released on Monday.

The Germans are also less attached to the European Union, suggested the poll, which was conducted July 3 to 8 in both countries.

Some 49 per cent of those Germans questioned said they would be personally better off if the EU did not exist, compared to 34 per cent of French who said they would be better, or much better off without the EU.

The poll, also carried out in Poland, showed only 28 per cent of Poles believed they would be better without the EU.

Nevertheless, despite their apparent skepticism about the euro on a personal level, 69 per cent of Germans said they believed the EU was a model for the rest of the world, compared to 56 per cent of French and 59 per cent of Poles.

Germany has largely managed to ride out the recession that has engulfed most of the world due to its strong export market and solid industrial base. But the economy is now slowly heading south and, with no end in sight to the euro crisis, disillusion with the currency that their chancellor Angela Merkel has staked her career on is expected to grow.

Last week the country's highest court green-lighted the bailout funds for the euro that will cost German taxpayers Â£151billion - 60 per cent of all tax revenues for this year.

Germans who bought into the assurances that the euro was a strong currency that would be good for trade, good for banks, good for savings and would do away with pricey, pesky foreign exchange transactions when going on holiday to boot, now find themselves deeply disillusioned with it.

Only the political and banking elite are still fighting for it, believing its failure would be a failure of the entire European project.

Many experts believe it will still be Greece that rips the eurozone apart, despite the hundreds of billions in aid which has flooded into the country. Bankruptcy would be a tectonic shock to the euro zone from which it would probably not recover.

The world economy would be plunged into turmoil and recession the like of which has not been seen since the great depression of the 1930's.

The so-called troika of the EU Commission, the European Bank and the IMF has recently been intensely monitoring Greek efforts to make the cutbacks demanded of it for more aid.

They have been severely disappointed at what has been achieved so far - just one third of savings targets reached in the past two years. If the IMF turns off the money tap, so will other countries like the Netherlands and Finland, who have linked their aid directly to the IMF.
