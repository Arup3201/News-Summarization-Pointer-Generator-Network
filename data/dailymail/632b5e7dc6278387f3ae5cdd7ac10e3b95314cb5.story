Holly Hewett from Kent, whose mobile phone caught fire while it was on charge

A woman narrowly escaped serious injury after she woke up to find her mobile phone had caught fire while charging.

Holly Hewett from Kelmsley in Kent was woken by a ‘sizzling sound’ and the smell of burning.

She looked down and saw her Samsung Galaxy S4 smouldering as it charged on the carpeted floor. At the risk of being burnt, she grabbed the smartphone, ran to the bathroom and threw it in the sink.

The 25-year-old said: ‘I’ve never had anything like this happen to me before.

‘It had only been charging for about 50 minutes. Even though it was dark I could smell the smoke.

‘I picked it up and the screen sparked. As I walked to the bathroom the battery fell out of the casing at the back onto the floor. I didn’t burn myself but there’s a hole in the carpet where it scorched it.’

Miss Hewett then grabbed the smartphone and ran to the bathroom and threw it in the sink.

The civil servant added: 'I woke up at 4.30am when my boyfriend got up to go to work and looked at my phone to check the time.

'I noticed it was running low on battery so I plugged it in and put it on charge.

'At about 5am I checked the time again then rolled over and went back to sleep, but within about 10 minutes of that I heard a sizzling sound.

'Even though it was dark I could smell the smoke. I picked it up and the screen sparked.

'As I walked to the bathroom the battery fell out of the casing at the back onto the floor.

'I didn’t burn myself but there’s a hole in the carpet where it scorched it. The smell was awful, so I opened a window.'

She added: 'I was on my own and panicked because I’d got no house phone so I didn’t know how to contact anyone to let them know what had happened.

Miss Hewett said the phone had only been charging for 50 minutes before catching alight

'My boyfriend’s brother is about a five-minute drive away, but I kept thinking ‘it’s too early’.

'In the end, after unplugging everything, I drove to my dad’s house.'

This is not the first time Samsung products have apparently set alight – last year a man posted a video on YouTube showing the damage to his Samsung Galaxy S4 when it caught fire while charging. He also claimed Samsung ordered him to remove the footage before they would replace it.

A Samsung spokesman said: ‘Once we have received the product in question, we will conduct a thorough examination to determine the exact cause of the incident. We would like to assure our customers that we employ robust quality controls to ensure the safety of our products.’
