This is the moment a New Jersey driver gets spooked in the dark after being brought to a halt by two cones blocking the road.

Ivan Tukhtin, 24, was traveling along the I-78 just after midnight on Sunday morning when he spotted the suspicious scene.

Dash camera footage shows him slowing down to avoid the cones, when all of a sudden a man wearing a hoodie comes out of the shadows.

Ominous feeling: After a brief conversation with the man, Mr Tukhtin speeds off weaving around the cones

Mr Tukhtin is heard asking if he can help with something. 

The man replies 'yes' before walking over to the driver's door.

At that point Mr Tukhtin accelerates and speeds off, weaving around the cones. 

He said he didn't think there was anything sinister about the man until he saw him reach into his pockets.

'Scary to think what could have happened,' he reflected.

The third-year law student later pulled over and called 911 to report the incident. 

State police captain Stephen Jones told ABC News that the cones were gone by the time officers responded.

However, they found the man Mr Tukhtin saw along with another man and learned their car had run out of gas. It's believed they were using the cones to get help.

Both were arrested, with 37-year-old Kareem Walston from Orange, New Jersey, facing charges for driving under the influence and 36-year-old Hashen Clark from Jersey City for hindering.

The incident remains under investigation.
