Large families could see their child benefit slashed under plans being submitted to ministers.

Payments should be cut sharply for children after the third and limited to just four children in future, an influential think tank said.

The proposal, which is published today by the centre-right Policy Exchange, would save £1billion over five years as benefit payments to large families would rise at a lower annual rate than those to smaller families.

It would reduce payments to a family with four children by more than £135 a year by 2020 – and go some way to help ministers hit their target of saving £12billion from the welfare budget over the next parliament.

It is likely to cause controversy – as families who currently receive payments for several children would see their benefits gradually reduced. However, it may be seen as a more palatable option than imposing a stricter ‘cap’ on the number of children for whom parents can claim.

A YouGov poll, commissioned as part of the research, found two thirds of the public support capping child benefit at four children. This was backed by more than 83 per cent of Tory voters and more than half of Labour and Lib Dem voters.

Steve Hughes, the report author, said: ‘The Chancellor has suggested that annual welfare savings of £12billion will have to be found to avoid further and faster cuts to departmental budgets.

‘Choosing where this money comes from is not easy, but with such high levels of public support, capping child benefit at four children and redesigning payment levels offers a very real opportunity to generate some much needed savings in the fairest way possible.’ This financial year, families receive £20.50 a week for their first child and £13.55 a week for each additional child, with no cap on numbers.

Payment amounts had been frozen since 2011 but rose by 1 per cent this tax year, with the same rise due next year.

Policy Exchange proposes that until 2019/20 – the end of the next parliament – child benefit for the first child should rise by 1 per cent a year.

For the second child the amount should rise by 2 per cent a year and for the third child by 1 per cent a year. But for the fourth child and any further children, the amount would be frozen at the 2015/16 level of £13.70 throughout the parliament.

In addition, it suggests the Government could go a step further and stop child benefit for any additional children after the fourth, born after April 2016.

If the policy was implemented, a family of four would see their annual child benefit cheque fall from £3,481.40 to £3,346.20.

George Osborne has suggested that a Conservative government would seek to save billions more from the welfare budget if the party wins the next election.

In January last year, around 1.1million parents lost some or all of their child benefit as income-related changes came into force.

Families in which one parent earns more than £60,000 before tax lost the benefit entirely, while those earning more than £50,000 lost some of it on a sliding scale.
