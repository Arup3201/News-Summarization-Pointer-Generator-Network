Banned: Paul Crick, 45, routinely called the emergency services and disturbed neighours by screaming and shouting

An alcoholic has been banned from swearing in his own home for five years after calling 999 over 170 times in 16 months - only to abuse them when they came to his aid.

Paul Crick, 45, was finally arrested in August when his relentless calls to the emergency line, which started in April 2012, showed no sign of stopping.

Neighbours in Waltham Abbey, Essex, also complained about Crick's constant shouting and swearing.

Today, Essex Police revealed he has been given an ASBO that bars him from swearing anywhere - even in his own home.

He is also banned from dialling 999 unless in a genuine emergency.

An Essex Police spokesman said: 'The court heard how he makes regular unnecessary calls to the emergency services, causes a significant level of disturbance and distress to his neighbours.

'The ASBO was deemed necessary to prevent him from causing further harassment, alarm or distress to his neighbours.

'It was stated that Crick prevents the emergency services from dealing with cases of genuine emergency and appears to use any opportunity to abuse employees of Essex Police and the ambulance service.'

Presiding magistrate Russell Pearson told Chelmsford Magistrate's Court: 'No shouting, even in your own home if you are heard by all your neighbours.'

Crick, who told the court he is attending an alcohol support group and psychiatrist, did not object to the ruling and £200 costs.

Crick was handed an ASBO that bars him from NHS premises and calling the emergency line for five years

The order states Crick must not contact the emergency services via 999 save when genuinely in need of assistance of those services or use foul language in a public place or in his home.

He is also banned from acting in a threatening manner towards people not of his own household, and must leave NHS premises if ordered by a member of staff.

The ASBO expires on December 16, 2018.
