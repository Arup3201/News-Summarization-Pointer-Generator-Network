A couple have been arrested and charged with child abuse and animal cruelty after 300 different pets were found in their Florida home.

Police were called to the home of Jeffrey O'Neil and Jennifer Kovacs yesterday when the pair reported that their 16-month-old daughter was missing.

The girl was found safe - but her parents were arrested over the menagerie of snakes, lizards, rats and other animals which made the house almost uninhabitable.

O'Neil, 28, and 26-year-old Kovacs called police at six o'clock on Sunday morning when they woke up after a party and realised their daughter was not in the house.

When police arrived at their home in Oldsmar, the pair were apparently drunk, while the house had an overwhelming stench due to the animals - both dead and alive - which were being kept there.

Officers discovered a note from a relative who had taken the girl when she found O'Neil passed out from drinking, and the child was determined to be safe and well.

The 298 animals in the house were removed by Tampa Bay Society for the Prevention of Cruelty to Animals.

Filth: The house was full of dirty cages and had an overwhelming smell thanks to the 300 animals there

Dangerous: Authorities said the presence of animals such as pythons made the house unsafe for a child

According to the Pinella County sheriff's office, O'Neil and Kovacs were keeping seven Burmese pythons, 20 other snakes, more than 100 lizards, 100 rats and mice to feed to the reptiles, other assorted rodents and two dead scorpion spiders.

'Looking at the animals, this is definitely a case of animal hoarding,' an SPCA spokesman told Fox Tampa Bay.

The unemployed couple are being held without bail at the county jail.

O'Neil's Facebook profile says he is the owner of 'J&J's Reptile/Rodent Shack & Rescue', which aims at 'respecting and protecting many reptile/exotic species by promoting conservation education'.

He does not have a licence to breed or sell animals.

Menace: Neighbours claim they have to be careful about going outside due the the number of reptiles

Police described the condition of the house as 'deplorable' and said it was unfit for a child to live in - but Kovacs' mother Joyce, who also lives there, says that apart from the strong smell it is a decent place to live.

The 63-year-old said O'Neil brought the animals when he moved in with her and her daughter three years ago.

'You just can't imagine having that many critters,' she said.

Mrs Kovacs, a retired teacher's assistant, told Fox she had put up with the couple for the sake of her granddaughter, and added that she would now seek custody of the girl.

Neighbour Scott Giles told the Tampa Bay Times that O'Neil's animals caused a major nuisance in the area.

He said he spent much of his time chasing snakes away from his yard, and had had to forbid his children from playing outside.
