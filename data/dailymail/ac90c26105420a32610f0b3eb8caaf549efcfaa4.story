A mobile DNA testing facility ensconced in an jury-rigged Winnebago has been cruising New York City of late, picking up street hails as if it were a taxi and offering on-the-spot DNA testing.

The owner of the R.V. - or as he calls it, a mobile medical facility - says he caters to family cases like long-lost sisters.

But Health Street doesn't really make any bones about who it's really pitching, cheekily emblazoning the question, 'Who's Your Daddy? on the vehicle's side.

Who's Your Daddy?: Mobile facility is ensconced in a jury-rigged, blue-and-brown Winnebago that is cheekily emblazoned with the question, 'Who's Your Daddy?' on its side

The clinic started in 
2010 but was revamped two months ago.

The facility, owned by Health Street, which was founded by Jared Rosenthal (pictured), caters to a variety of clients, including returning soldiers who want to confirm the paternity of newly-born babies

Indeed, the 28-foot brown-and-blue R.V. looks more like a mobile home than a medical facility, but the interior does provide the service it promises, starting at $299.

'It's just such a serious, fundamental question ... who are your children? Who are your parents?' Jared Rosenthal, the founder of Health Street, told Reuters.

Rosenthal also drives the R.V., stopping much like a taxi cab for passersby who hail it on the street for impromptu paternity tests.

One New Yorker, who declined to give his name discovered he was the dad of a long-lost daughter he had fathered with a woman he had dated some 20 years ago.

The 44-year-old married father of two - make that now three - confirmed the paternity in July.

'This issue is still raw and very sensitive,' he said. 'I will get to 
know my daughter ... this is something I'm taking one day at a time.'

Inside the facility, technicians take DNA samples, which are then packaged and shipped off to an Ohio  laboratory. Results are returned three to five business days later.

Mandatory prescriptions from a physician can be faxed via the Internet to waiting techs.

Experts say there has been a steady 
increase in demand for such tests in the U.S., reaching close to 500,000
a year - in part to the uptick in  births to unmarried women.

Cruisin': Much like a taxi, the mobile DNA-testing unit will stop for street hails from passersby who want an on-the-spot DNA test to confirm paternity and whatnot

In 2010, at least 382,199 so-called 'relationship tests' were conducted in the U.S., although the total is likely much higher because some labs don't submit data, according to the AABB,, which accredits 'relationship testing' facilities.

State child-support agencies make up the bulk of this demand, but experts said the number of people simply seeking answers has dramatically increased.

 'It's just such a serious, fundamental question ... who are your children? Who are your parents?'

'The bigger question is what do we do with this information. Why are we looking for it and what do we think it means?' said Susan Crockin, a lawyer who teaches at Georgetown Law Center and specializes in reproductive technology.

'The underlying issues are obviously the quality of testing,' Crockin said.

Typical Health Street customers include engaged men who want to confirm offspring from a past relationship, returning soldiers seeking reassurance they fathered newly-born children, and women inquiring about the paternity of their children.

So far, Rosenthal said, two women learned they were half-sisters, and a man whose 
suspicion that he might be the father of a friend's daughter was 
confirmed.

However, the door is open to heartbreak, especially when men discover that somebody else fathered their children.

'If you're really happy with the children in your life, don't go near these things,' Bishai said David 
Bishai, a professor at Johns Hopkins Bloomberg School of Public 
Health.

Rosenthal's experiment is by no means groundbreaking - it's fairly common, said experts, for DNA testing labs to offer mobile collection services.

However, his mobile facility may be the first to splash the phrase, 'DNA TESTING' in bold red lettering on its side.

Health experts advise customers to only use labs accredited by AABB or distributors who use those labs, but there are no regulations on the outfits themselves. It is also not illegal to run a DNA testing laboratory that is not AABB-certified.
