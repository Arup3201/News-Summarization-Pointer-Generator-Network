Six players made their debuts as Liverpool hosted Southampton on Sunday, all looking to make an instant impact.

Dejan Lovren was the most high profile, facing his former club, though Adam Lallana missed out on that same chance.

Here, Sportsmail takes a look at who impressed and who faltered in their first game.

LIVERPOOL

Javier Manquillo

Plenty of energy down the right-hand side, but was perhaps lucky to be let off in the lead up to Liverpool's opener. Had the tricky task of keeping Dusan Tadic quiet but didn't look out of place on his Premier League debut. Two-year loan may prove to be good, if not odd, business.

Energetic: Javier Manquillo got used to the physicallity of the Premier League straight away on his debut

Dejan Lovren

Provoked cheers and boos every time he touched the ball, looked at home at Anfield. A rugged centre-back whose instincts are to defend first and foremost, a rarity of late for a Liverpool defender. £20million may sound like a lot for a solid defender, but if David Luiz is worth £50m...

Presence: Dejan Lovren provoked cheers and boos every time he touched the ball, and was solid in defence

Rickie Lambert

Emotional debut at Anfield for the 31-year-old, albeit from the substitute's bench. While his introduction may have culminated in Liverpool's winner, he didn't have enough time to truly make an impact. 

SOUTHAMPTON

Fraser Forster

£10m is a lot to spend on a goalkeeper but after Fraser Forster's displays for Celtic handed him a World Cup squad, there was no more sought-after stopper in England. Could do nothing about Raheem Sterling's goal, and made several solid saves as Liverpool dominated the first half. 

Glove specialist: Fraser Forster may turn out to be a coup for Southampton at £10m

Ryan Bertrand

Struggled early on in the first half as Philippe Coutinho, Manquillo and Jordan Henderson targeted the left-back. Grew into the game though, and should prove to be a fine replacement for Luke Shaw. Southampton knew what they were getting when they loaned Bertrand. A consistent, but young, performer who knows the Premier League inside out.

Energetic: Ryan Bertrand impressed for Southampton at left-back, making up for Luke Shaw's departure

Dusan Tadic

The best of them all. Tadic showed plenty of promise in the first half and was always willing to take his man on, but failed to deliver at times. Come the second half the Serbian winger really showed what he was about. Drifting in from the left, his beautiful backheel flick set up Nathaniel Clyne's equaliser.

Talented: Dusan Tadic was instrumental for Southampton on his debut, setting up their only goal

Graziano Pelle

Strikers who score plenty in Holland tend to struggle in England, and Pelle's start to life on these shores could certainly have been better. Looked languid up front, lacking movement, and was dealt with easily in the first period by Lovren. More impressive when midfielders and defenders ran off him, but never seemed likely to trouble Simon Mignolet directly. 

Static: Graziano Pelle's movement wasn't great on Sunday, he may turn out to be another flop from Holland

Shane Long

Thrown on when the going got tough, Long will hopefully have more time to help justify that £12m fee in the future for the Saints. Missed a fine chance after Morgan Schneiderlin's effort hit the bar, heading wide with the goalkeeper down.
