Aneri Patel, 16, was killed when a four-wheel drive smashed in a chemist in Sydney

The Year 11 schoolgirl who died after a four wheel drive smashed into a Sydney chemist this afternoon has been named as Aneri Patel, 16. 

A female driver was taken to hospital suffering shock after the crash in the southern Sydney suburb of Kogarah at 11.30 am, police told Daily Mail Australia. 

The crash occurred at the same spot  as where a 20-year-old student was killed by a car in 2007.

The driver, an unlicensed 26-year-old woman, was arrested on Monday night and was being questioned by police. 

Ms Patel, who studied at Kogarah High School, was hit while waiting for a bus and trapped under the vehicle in the chemist next to an ANZ bank. She suffered critical injuries and died at the scene.

'She was a student at a nearby school... we have just spoken to her parents,' a police spokesperson said. 

The female driver has been taken to St George Hospital suffering shock and will undergo mandatory testing, police said.

'The 29-year-old female passenger and owner of the vehicle was treated in hospital for shock,' police said.

'We are looking at speed as a factor,' the police spokesperson added. 

Two children passengers, aged two and four, weren't injured but an 84-year-old man who was shopping in the chemist and a 51-year-old female employee were taken to St George Hospital with non-life threatening injuries.

Products from the chemist including boxes of babies' nappies were strewn over the floor outside  

Parents of children at Kogarah High School were told of tragedy on Monday afternoon.

'I need to inform you of some sad news,' Deputy Principal Ross Tindale wrote in a text message.

'One of our Year 11 students Aneri Patel has passed away as a result of an accident ... The parents have been informed.'

Mr Tindale said in the message that counselling would be available to students.

Year 11 exams were postponed until Tuesday and Wednesday, however Thursday and Friday would be normal school days for the year group.

One mother in Kogarah said her daughter was upset by the news. 

'She was in the same year, she was shaken,' she said.

The accident happened on the same spot as another fatal accident in 2007

The accident happened in the same place that Emma Hansen, 20, was killed outside ANZ bank on the corner of Railway Parade and Montgomery Street when a learner-driver crashed into a queue of people waiting for a bus in 2007.

The fashion student sustained massive head and chest injuries and died while undergoing emergency surgery.  

'The school community’s thoughts are with the student’s family and friends,' a NSW Department of Education spokesman said.

'The school is providing counselling support to students and staff.'

A witness named Harry told the paper: 'The car came around the bend... all of a sudden I heard a thud of the car hitting the gutter, bouncing up going straight into the chemist window and as it was going through the window it missed a lady with a pram by about 18 inches.' 

Ambulance Service of NSW said they have transported three people to St George Hospital

Ambulance and fire brigade staff worked hard to free people trapped under the car 

Astonishingly Harry was also a witness to the 2007 accident where Emma Hansen was killed. 

On Monday, Ambulance Service of NSW said they have transported three people to St George Hospital with two serious and one critical. They are still assessing a fourth person on the scene. 

Buses have been diverted away from the intersection. 

Police are investigating the accident and are appealing for any witnesses to the crash to come forward. A report will be prepared for the Coroner.
