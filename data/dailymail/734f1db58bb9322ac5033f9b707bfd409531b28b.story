It's a job for the flying squad, at the very least a member of the Old Bill who wonâ€™t duck a challenge.

Officers at Sutton Coldfield Police Station were called out at 7am to help mallard Matilda and her six ducklings who were stranded outside a pub in the West Midlands town.

Two officers were dispatched to the Bottle of Sack pub after the manager became concerned that the family of ducks were risking their lives crossing a busy road to reach a nearby brook.

Help from the old bill: Two police officers help Matilda and her ducklings cross the road in Sutton Coldfield

The hardest part was rounding them up in the pub's beer garden; after that they did as the policemen told them

Caroline Wrenn, who runs the Wetherspoons pub, said the mallard moved into the pub garden five months ago and has already raised one family of ducklings there without a problem.

But when she watched the latest brood try their luck at crossing the road, she decided it was time to call the police.

She said: 'To start with, I think they thought it was a hoax, but when the officers arrived, they were marvellous.

'Finding all the chicks in the beer garden was the hardest part. Once they were at the roadside they seemed to instinctively know where to go.'

Matilda has become a much loved regular at the pub and still makes regular visits, despite her latest family flying the ceramic nest she hatched them in.

Barmaid Kirsten Jeffs said: 'Locals really look after her and enjoy watching her waddle around the beer garden.'

Matilda and her brood were ushered safely across the road before the officers considered their work done

Matilda is becoming used to have uniformed help when she needs to move her family around.

In May, rangers from nearby Sutton Park helped her first, eight-strong brood reach water safely.

A park spokesman said 'The duck nested in a less than ideal place, so when the youngsters hatched they were exposed to the road.

'We took them to the nearest running water stream and let them go. It had a happy ending.'
