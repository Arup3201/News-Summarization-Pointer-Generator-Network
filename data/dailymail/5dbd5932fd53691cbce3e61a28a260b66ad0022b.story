Mother of three Allison Baden-Clay was engaged to a strapping scuba diving instructor before she was pursued by Gerard Baden-Clay, the real estate agent she would eventually marry and who would later strangle her and dump her body in a creek near their family home. 

The new revelations about the murder that gripped Brisbane society are in a new book called The Murder of Allison Baden-Clay by The Courier Mail's crime and courts editor David Murray.

Baden-Clay, who had a string of affairs throughout his marriage and who was jailed for life in July, two years after his wife's murder, wooed Allison. They eventually married and had three daughters.

The book also reveals Baden-Clay expected to be arrested on the day he reported his wife missing and 10 days before he body was found in Kholo Creek, a few kilometres from their home in western Brisbane.

A new book, 'The Murder of Allison Baden Clay' by Courier Mail's crime and courts editor, David Murray reveals Allison could have led a happy and long life if she had married her first fiance

Murray reveals that in 1990 Allison met scuba instructor and former solider, Ian Drayton, when the pair both worked at Heron Island.

The couple, who bought two properties together, moved to Brisbane where they got engaged.

But the relationship wasn't meant to be and after five years together the couple split, as, Murray writes, they 'drifted apart'. 

Another short romance followed, before Allison met Baden-Clay, Around this time she was considering getting back together with former love Mr Drayton.

In a fateful decision, she chose the man who would end her life, confiding in friends at the time she was 'hopelessly divided'. 

They were married in 1997.

The book on the infamous murder also revealed Baden-Clay had a bizarre conversation with an investigating officer on the day he reported his wife missing, telling him that if he was going to be arrested, he wanted his sister to have custody of their three children.

Following his arrest his family also sought the help of a wealthy state MP.

Bruce Flegg received a phone call from Baden-Clay's sister Olivia shortly after his arrest asking him to put up $1 million as a surety for his bail. Mr Flegg was unable to help.

In April 2012, Allison was reported missing by her then husband Gerard. Almost immediately police treated her death as a murder and two months later in June 2012, charged the former Brisbane real estate agent.

Allison’s parents Geoff and Priscilla Dickie have taken leading roles in caring for their three daughters since Allison's death and remain their guardians.

The murder trial exposed a relationship in turmoil between the Baden-Clays, despite appearing successful and happy from the outside.

It was revealed the couple were in deep financial trouble and Baden-Clay was caught between his wife and his lover, lying to both.

Toni McHugh was a former work colleague of Baden-Clay's and an affair started between the pair in August 2008.

It's believed the affair ended when Allison found out about it in 2011 but it resumed the following year when her husband claimed he would leave his wife for Ms McHugh.

But in court the former real estate agent claimed he had no intentions of leaving Allison, despite no longer having a loving and sexual relationship. 

The trial also revealed Allison had struggled with depression and the pressures of everyday life and the couple saw a marriage counsellor days before she was murdered.

Evidence also found there was in the boot of Allison's four-wheel drive which DNA testing confirmed it was hers.
