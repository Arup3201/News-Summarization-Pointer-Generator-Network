This is the heart-stopping moment a huge tree fell down in an exclusive London square - just metres from where children were stood in a nursery playground.

The enormous poplar tree, around 10ft wide and 60ft tall, crushed several cars in Colville Square in the upmarket borough of Kensington and Chelsea today.

In a moment of incredible good fortune, the tree fell from inside the secluded square, but landed outside and across the road.

A spokesman for Kensington and Chelsea Royal Borough council said no one has suffered any injuries as a result of the incident at around 2.30pm.

Disaster narrowly avoided: Fortunately, the huge tree fell out into the road and not into the children's playground

Wreckage: The fallen tree left crushed at least two vehicles parked in Colville Square

Powerful: The tree appears to be very mature, measuring at least 10ft in circumference

Witness Rochelle Labarrie, who lives opposite the tree, said children and nursery staff had been in the playground at the time.

'I just heard this huge noise and thought "what was that?"' she told MailOnline. 'My son said "the tree has fallen down". The next thing we could hear car alarms going off and looked out the balcony and it had crushed these cars.

'Everybody was kind of shocked and screaming "Oh my God". For young children that would've been very frightening. If it had fallen in there they would certainly have been seriously hurt if not dead.

'You're used to seeing these kinds of things in the Caribbean when there's been a hurricane. I've never seen anything like it.'

At least two cars, a Silver Toyota Avensis and a blue Mercedes are believed to have been written off, and three other cars damaged.

The branches landed perilously to some of the windows of the streets exclusive properties, where a two-bedroom flat was recently sold for Â£800,000.

It is not known what caused the tree to fall, but large roots were visible above the ground.

Community worker Ms Labarrie, 48, said she believed the tree was at least 100 years old and that residents had complained before that it appeared unstable.

'I've lived here for 30 years and we've complained about the tree before,' she said. 'When it rained or it was windy you could see it shaking.

'I believe in preserving trees but at the same time you have to make sure it's safe and secure for the community.'

A council spokesman said that tree 
surgeons had been called out to dispose of the tree and an investigation
 is ongoing into what caused it to fall.

He added that it had been trimmed in February and deemed to be alive.

Damage: A blue Mercedes also looks to have been severely crushed by the tree

Emergency: A policeman investigates the scene - it is believed no one was injured

Panic: A witness said staff and children had been in the playground at the time and appeared shocked
