A father has been jailed for eight years for killing his baby daughter after being frustrated by her screaming as he tried to play a computer game.

Mark Sandland, 28, sobbed as he was sentenced for picking up five-week-old Aimee-Rose by her torso and shaking her during a sudden loss of temper.

He claimed he suffered an epileptic fit and came round to find his daughter underneath him at their flat in St Leonards-on-Sea, East Sussex.

Guilty: Mark Sandland, 28, (pictured) shook his five-week-old daughter Aimee-Rose to death, causing injuries to her face, chest, abdomen, hip and lower limbs. He lost his temper because she disrupted his video game

Police who attended the flat after Aimee-Rose was admitted to hospital on November 5 2012 found a PlayStation game controller on the sofa opposite the TV.

Sandland was charged with murder but pleaded guilty to manslaughter on the grounds of lack of intent, which was accepted by the Crown.

Sentencing him at Hove Crown Court today, Judge Mr Justice Sweeney said that after he inflicted the injuries, Sandland lied and sought to cover up his actions.

Prosecutor Sally Howes QC told Lewes Crown Court on Monday that Sandland’s mobile phone internet history showed he logged on to a website offering tips on how to play Assassin’s Creed 3 on his PlayStation at 2.22pm.

The detail of the website, giving step-by-step instruction, meant there would have been little point accessing it unless the game was being played, she added.

Sentencing,
 Mr Justice Sweeney said: 'It’s the Crown’s case that thereafter, 
frustrated with the game and with Aimee-Rose screaming, you lost your 
temper and you assaulted her, gripping her torso hard and violently 
shaking her.'

'Whilst
 it’s impossible to identify the precise detail of what you did, the 
injuries that you caused Aimee-Rose speak for themselves.'

Her
 injuries included bruising to her face, chest, abdomen, hip and lower 
limbs. She also suffered a range of other injuries, including subdural 
haemorrhages in a number of locations.

Some 16 minutes after Sandland logged on to the website giving tips on Assassin’s Creed 3, he dialled 999.

Mr Justice Sweeney told Sandland: 'Whilst you have no recollection now of the fatal incident, it’s obvious that at the time you appreciated what you had done and in consequence lied and sought to cover up what had actually happened.'

'You pretended on the phone that you had a fit. You turned off the television to cover up the fact that you had been on the PlayStation.'

'Thereafter you continued to lie and cover up to those who were trying to treat Aimee-Rose, although I stress that they wouldn’t have done anything different if you had told the truth, and to the police.'

The judge said there were a number of aggravating features, including the fact that Aimee-Rose was a vulnerable child aged just five weeks old.

In addition, he said Sandland was in a position of trust, made repeated false accounts to cover up his actions, and had shown no real remorse.

The judge accepted it was a 'momentary' event lacking in premeditation and he sought emergency help, albeit giving a misleading account.

Mr Justice Sweeney said Sandland - who sobbed with his head down as he was sentenced - will serve half his jail sentence.

On release, he will be on licence for the remainder of his sentence and if he breaks the terms, will be liable for recall.

Concealed his crime: Mark Sandland initially claimed he had suffered an epileptic fit and came round to find his daughter underneath him

On the day of the fatal attack, 
Aimee-Rose’s mother was attending her first class for an applied social 
science degree at the University of Brighton’s Hastings campus.

During
 a break at around lunchtime, she sent Sandland a text message asking 
after Aimee-Rose, to which he replied: 'She hasn’t shut up since about 
half an hour after you left.'

When an ambulance crew arrived, Sandland
 looked 'panicked and anxious' and pointed to where she lay in the 
sitting room, her limbs in a star shape.

Sandland told one member of ambulance staff: 'I’m epileptic. I had a fit and when I woke up the baby was underneath me.'

Aimee-Rose was admitted to the Conquest Hospital in St Leonards unconscious, unresponsive and, although a heart-beat was re-established, she was unable to maintain respiratory effort without life support.

She was transferred to the paediatric intensive care unit at King’s College Hospital, London, but died on November 9 2012.

Miss Howes said the combination of the post-mortem findings of recent head injury, recent traumatic laceration of the liver and recent fracture of the left clavicle was consistent with inflicted injury of the 'shaking/impact type'.

Dr Hannah 
Cock, a consultant neurologist, found it was 'highly unlikely' that a 
seizure was a substantial contributor to Aimee-Rose’s injuries.

If he had suffered a seizure, Dr Cock would have expected him to drop anything he was holding and remember later.

Miss
 Howes said: 'Even if he had fallen on to Aimee-Rose, her pattern of 
injuries is not consistent with a fall and crushing alone. Dr Cock would
 have expected more disturbance to adjacent furniture than reported.'

One expert found Aimee-Rose sustained two episodes that had led to injury - one up to three weeks before she died and a second up to five days before death.

When Sandland was told he would be arrested, Miss Howes said he became upset and he said: 'I suppose you are going to say that you know what it is like to be accused of killing your daughter.'

In one police interview, he declined to answer most questions, except when he was asked if he had deliberately harmed her. He replied: 'No.'

Miss Howes said Sandland, who had an “unconventional upbringing” and was raised by his paternal grandparents, made suicide bids in 2006.

Two years later, he was diagnosed with Guillain-Barre syndrome, a rare condition of the peripheral nervous system, following which he began experiencing seizures.

But the court heard that no medical cause could be found to explain them and he was admitted to numerous hospitals between 2008 and 2012.
