The flamboyant former boss of British sports car maker Morgan has been ousted from the board of the company which has borne his family name for more than a century.

Charles Morgan, grandson of the company’s founder, vowed to fight his removal – just as employees at its factory staged an online revolt in support of him.

Mr Morgan, 62, stepped down as managing director seven months ago but retained the post of ‘ambassador’ for the historic firm. Now, however, new MD Steve Morris has announced that he would no longer have a role at all.

One Morgan employee tweeted: ‘We can't believe the company is not being run by a Morgan family member.

‘It's probably not best to name individuals on this account but the general feel around the factory is we would like Charles Morgan back’.

Another supporter tweeted: ‘Can't see how the current management team can be better placed than Charles Morgan to lead the organisation.’

Mr Morgan replied: ’Thanks from the depth of my heart. You are the lifeblood of the company and must be treated with the respect that you deserve.

‘Every one of you make Morgan a great company and great cars, never forget that.’

The firm said in a statement today: 
'Further to decisions taken in January of this year, Morgan Technologies
 is now in a position to announce that Charles Morgan is no longer part 
of the management team or board of directors of the company.

'Over
 recent months, and in response to the growth in volumes, model range 
and overseas markets, the company structure has been strengthened across
 a number of different areas. This reflects the scale and complexity of 
an increasingly global business.

'While
 these are significant developments for the company, the Morgan family, 
directors and management team look forward to sharing more news with the
 wider Morgan community in the near future.

'These
 changes will help cultivate an exciting future for Morgan which 
continues to reinforce the unique attributes of the brand.'

The statement went on: 'The Morgan family recognises the management contribution that Charles has made to the family business as strategy director, and confirm that he remains a shareholder.

‘However, to ensure continuing success, Morgan must look to strengthen and review its strategies, and acknowledge that our management team are better placed to steer the company in the future.'

But Mr Morgan hit back and told motoring magazine Autocar that he is appealing against the decision.

He
 added: 'As a family member I think I should have been consulted about 
this press release because it suggests that it comes from all of the 
family shareholders.

'It
 fails to explain what the decisions were back in January. It confuses 
growth in volumes with growth in sales and doesn't suggest whether we 
are responding to either. And it also suggests that I resisted overseas 
markets and global expansion when I was the one going abroad.'
