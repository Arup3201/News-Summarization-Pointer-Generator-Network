She's famous for being incredibly nice to everyone she meets and now singer Leona Lewis has gone one step further by revealing that she would give up her career to end animal testing.

Although the EU has outlawed testing beauty products on animals, the rest of the world is yet to follow suit - much to animal lover Lewis' dismay.

Asked to choose between a global ban on vivisection and her singing career by an interviewer, Lewis said that she would plump for the former, adding: 'I could still do my music
in any capacity if I wanted to, but I think it’s just so important for 
humans to show compassion.

'They say you can judge a society on how it 
treats its animals, and I think that’s very true – it all filters down.'

She added: 'The EU ban will put pressure
on the rest of the world: they won’t be able to sell their 
animal-tested products in Europe any longer, so it makes financial sense
that they replace their animal tests with alternative methods if they 
want to trade in this lucrative market.'

This isn't the first time Lewis has made clear her feelings on the issue of animal cruelty. In 2008, the singer reportedly turned down a seven-figure offer to appear at a Harrods sale launch from former boss Mohammed Al Fayed on the grounds that the retailer stocks fur.

She also supports several animal rights charities and has attempted to raise the profile of animal rights by collaborating with Topshop on an ethical accessories line and The Body Shop - which has long campaigned against vivisection - on a beauty range.

Along with a cruelty free make-up collection, vegetarian Lewis also fronts the beauty retailer's White Musk Libertine perfume collection.

Although real musk, which is taken from the Musk Deer, is banned under the CITES act on endangered species, synthetic musk, as used in The Body Shop's product, does no harm to animals - or the people who use it.

That the chemical, which predates The Body Shop, was declared safe for use after extensive testing - some of which could have been done on animals - cuts no ice with Lewis, who points out that vivisection is far less effective than modern tests.

'I tell [cynical people] there are so many tests that are so superior to animal testing that the practice is actually laughable and needless,' she revealed in an interview with Cosmopolitan.

'I’m really hopeful but people need to know there’s still a long way to go - I don’t want them to get complacent and not sign the Cruelty Free International pledge.

'I’m not about bashing people over the head and telling them what they should do, but I have a point to make and I will make it subtly, showing people they can choose to do the right thing.'

Lewis also revealed that she refuses to use any product that could have something of animal origin and insists that her make-up artist and hair stylist don't use products that have been tested on living creatures.

'I definitely am quite strict about it. My makeup and hair people know I don’t use any brushes that use real animal hair, and we stay away from products from parts of the world where they’re animal-tested and not humane at all. And I’ve found there are websites with good information on what products are cruelty-free.'

Pet: When she's not singing, Lewis loves nothing more than spending time with her beloved pet dog, Lily

'I really love Unite haircare, Liz Earle and Aveda,' she added. 'Also The Body Shop’s dry oils, which I put on in the shower, and its Strawberry Bubble Bath and Coconut Body Butter are the best things ever.

'I’m quite obsessed with coconut – I put it on my skin and on my hair. I learnt that from my grandma. I even put it on my horse. That sounds pretty weird, but I put it in his hair and he really loves it!'

But it hasn't all been smooth sailing for Lewis thanks to confusing labels and baffling chemical names, which meant that she had to give up some products after discovering they contain cochineal (made from beetle blood) and fish scales.

'I’ve only just learnt that a lot of the red pigment in cosmetics is actually from beetles, and I think some of the shimmers in bronzers can be made from fish scales.

'So I like Body Shop products; I don’t have to worry about such ingredients in its red lipsticks and shimmer palettes. I couldn’t even kill a spider or a fly or anything. I’m very Buddhist in that sense.'
