Adnan Januzaj staked a claim for being included in Louis van Gaal's side to face Leicester City at the weekend by netting a hat-trick for Manchester United's Under 21 team in a 4-0 win over Sunderland.

The Belgium youngster played just eight minutes of Manchester United's emphatic 4-0 win over Queens Park Rangers at the weekend after coming on for summer signing Angel di Maria.

Januzaj will have to bide his time at Old Trafford over the course of the season following the arrival of Di Maria, Ander Herrera and Radamel Falcao - but showed his true quality in front of the watching Van Gaal.

Manchester United: Amos; Janko, McNair, Vermijl, Shaw (Pearson 46); Thorpe, Anderson (Rothwell 72), A. Pereira, Harrop; Januzaj (Weir 83), W. Keane

Substitutes not used: O'Hara, Grimshaw

Scorers: Januzaj 20, 27, 81; A. Pereira 22

Sunderland: Stryjek, Cartwright, T Robson, Agnew, McNamee, Ferguson, Watmore, Smith (E Robson 65), Gooch (Pybus 87), Lawson, Greenwood (Oliver 65)

Substitutes not used: Dixon, Sukar

Manchester United assistant managers Ryan Giggs and Albert Stuivenberg along with fitness coach Tony Strudwick were also at Old Trafford to witness Januzaj's impressive performance. 

It will give Van Gaal food for thought as his expensively-assembled squad fight for places in the starting line-up. 

First team stars Luke Shaw and Anderson also played a part in Manchester United's victory in a bid to step up their fitness.

Shaw was denied the chance to make his Manchester United debut at the weekend as Van Gaal instead opted to start fellow summer signing Marcos Rojo at left back.

Anderson, on the other hand, was left out of the Dutchman's 18-man squad despite the fact fellow central midfielders Michael Carrick and Marouane Fellaini missed the game through injury.

Andreas Pereira, who was an unused substitute against QPR at the weekend, grabbed the other goal in a convincing win for Manchester United.

Januzaj was eager to impress and it took just two minutes for the Belgium international to create his first opening - Anderson slipped him in but Januzaj's shot found only the side netting. Saidy Janko was the next to pose a threat, bursting forward and firing narrowly wide of the mark. 

A United goal was inevitable and Januzaj duly obliged in the 20th minute when he played a one-two with Will Keane before placing the ball into the net with a low left-footed drive.

Brazil Under 20 international Pereira doubled the lead just three minutes later after getting on the end of a  cross by Shaw, who had been found by Josh Harrop's astute pass out wide.

Sunderland were shell-shocked and Januzaj added a third on 27 minutes - United's third goal in the space of just seven minutes - with a typically composed finish after Keane and Shaw combined to good effect.

Januzaj almost completed his hat-trick before the break after Janko again powered forward from the back. The Belgian produced some lovely pieces of skill but could only locate the side-netting. 

United slowed down the pace in the second half though Anderson nearly scored the fourth when his strike beat Sunderland goalkeeper Maksymilian Stryjek but rebounded back off the post. 

Januzaj completed the rout in the second half after he beat  Stryjek from close range after Marnick Vermijl had delved deep into enemy territory.
