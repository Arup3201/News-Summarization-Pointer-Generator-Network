McLaren's new supercar will have a staggering 903bhp but also be as green as a family saloon, it was revealed today.

The stunning P1 is among the most hotly anticipated car launches of the past 20-years with details slowly emerging on its performance.

Woking-based McLaren has now confirmed the P1 will use a 3.8-litre twin-turbocharged engine which develops 727bhp.

The car will emit less carbon dioxide than many family saloons

The P1 will be able to drive for 6.2 miles using its electric engine - producing no carbon dioxide at all

But it will also benefit from an electric motor which adds a further 176bhp to the car's total output.

This power is expected to give the P1 a 0-62mph time of less than three seconds and a top speed in excess of 230mph.

However, it will also be able to drive up to 6.2 miles on electric power alone where it doesn't emit any carbon dioxide.

McLaren says this will help slash the car's carbon dioxide emissions to 'less than 200g/km' - which is better than a 2.4-litre Honda Accord family saloon.

A Bugatti Veyron emits 559g/km of carbon dioxide while the Ferrari 458 averages 307g/km.

The P1 will make its global debut at next month's Geneva Motor Show with deliveries of the £800,000-plus car expected by the end of 2013.

A spokesman for the company said: 'The McLaren P1 has one simple goal: to be the best driver's car in the world on road and track.'

McLaren Automotive executive chairman Ron Dennis added: 'The McLaren P1 will be the result of 50 years of racing and road car heritage

'Twenty years ago we raised the supercar performance bar with the McLaren F1 and our goal with the McLaren P1 is to redefine it once again.'

McLaren automotive managing director Antony Sheriff said: 'Our aim is not necessarily to be the fastest in absolute top speed but to be the quickest and most rewarding series production road car on a circuit.'

He added: 'It is the true test of a supercar's all round ability and a much more important technical statement. Our goal is to make the McLaren P1 the most exciting, most capable, most technologically advanced and most dynamically accomplished supercar ever made.'

The flagship McLaren P1 will sit above the existing 12C and 12C Spider, in terms of both price and performance.
