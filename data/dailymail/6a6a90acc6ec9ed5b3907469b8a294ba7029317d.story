Huge landslides in the outskirts of Hiroshima have killed at least 36 people after a wall of mud sparked by torrential rain wiped out dozens of houses burying many alive. 

Rescuers in Japan are still trying to work through piles of wreckage in their bid to find the seven people missing - with one heroic volunteer, 53, dying in a secondary landslide after he had pulled five people to safety.

Aerial shots show houses buried in thick slurry, their wooden frames splintered by the weight of the mud as torrents of brown water seep through broken buildings hampering rescue efforts.

With some still trapped, Prime Minister Shinzo Abe, has deployed troops to the area and said considerable resources will spent on aid for the disaster

Earlier today, while many were believed trapped, Prime Minister Shinzo Abe, deployed troops to the area and said considerable resources would be spent on aid for the disaster.

Commenting on the missing residents, local government official, Nakatoshi Okamoto, said: ' A few people were washed away and it is hard to know exactly how many are unaccounted for.'

Soldiers are still working their way through the devastated town with some emergency workers having to climb up to second floors and roofs of half-collapsed houses  to reach any survivors.

Pictures showed there had been at least five different landslides. On top of the 36 dead and seven missing, 15 people have been injured, two seriously.

Hillsides caved in or were swept down into residential areas in at least five valleys in the suburbs of the western Japanese city after heavy rains left slopes unstable.

Some uprooted trees and carried rocks down the hillside into the tightly-packed houses that sit on the edge of a commuter belt, in an area where town gives way to farmland.

One man, gesturing to the mud-covered remains of a house, told NHK: 'My house is over there, flattened.'

Japan's weather agency warned more heavy rain was on the way to the area, raising the risk of further landslides in places where tonnes of mud have already been displaced

Pointing elsewhere, he said: 'A leg was seen [sticking out of the mud] and they are trying to confirm if the person is alive. The first thing we have to do is to help that person.'

Another man told reporters he had seen everything he owned swept away.

He said: 'We could hear the earth rumbling and all of a sudden, things roared past us.'

A woman spoke of how she had escaped death because of where she had been at the time the disaster struck.

She said: 'I was able to survive as I stayed in the middle of the house. Both sides were destroyed.'

The archipelago has been battered in recent weeks by unusually heavy rain that has sparked a number of smaller landslides and several floods, some of which have claimed lives

Despite widespread concreting to shore up hillsides, mountainous and densely populated Japan is prone to this kind of disaster

Prime Minister, Shinzo Abe, who abandoned a golfing holiday to deal with the disaster, said: 'I have ordered (government officials) to carry out the rescue operation in an integrated manner, aware of the possibility of further rain.'

'I also ordered them to raise the number of Self-Defense Force (military) personnel to several hundred in order to strengthen rescue operations.'

Hiroshima Mayor, Kazumi Matsui, said: 'It's so regrettable. We'll find out what went wrong and take the necessary measures.'

Landslides are a constant risk in mountainous, crowded Japan, where many homes are built on or near steep slopes.

Torrential rains in the early morning apparently caused slopes to collapse in an area where many of the buildings were newly constructed.

Hiroshima is no stranger to tragedy like 
this. In 1999 more than 320 landslides hit the city, including the area 
affected on Wednesday, killing more than 30 people.

The city's geology, consisting of highly water-retentive soil, makes the city particularly prone to such disasters, according to Hiroshi Ikeya, a landslide expert at the National Graduate Institute for Policy Studies. 

He claimed the damage was extensive 'because of intense rain, extremely fragile slopes and the disaster hitting in the dead of night'.

Around 32,000 areas in the locality are designated as at risk from landslides.

Experts said many of the hills are composed of fragmented granite, which can become unstable when waterlogged.

In October last year, dozens of people were also killed when the torrential rains of a passing typhoon triggered large landslides on the island of Oshima, south of Tokyo.
