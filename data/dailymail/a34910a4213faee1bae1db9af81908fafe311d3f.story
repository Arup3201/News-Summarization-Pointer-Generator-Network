Fabio Borini took to Instagram on Monday as he shared a selfie of himself with the Script's lead singer Danny O'Donoghue.

The Liverpool striker, whose last appearance for the Reds came in the FA Cup win at Bolton last month, was at the Manchester Arena on Saturday as the Irish band performed in front of a packed out attendance.

And the 23-year-old was clearly impressed with what he saw on the night, as he then got backstage access to see the band after the concert.

Accompanied with a picture alongside O'Donoghue Borini said: 'The other night @thescriptofficial concert in Manchester! Unbelievable show!! Thanks for the picture..and thanks to the wonderful backstage staff and their awful banter! Ahaha.' 

Borini also posted a photo of the packed-out crowd with the message: 'The Show! @thescriptofficial.' 

On the pitch the Italy forward has found playing time hard to come by this season at Liverpool, scoring just once in all competitions - that in a 2-0 win at Aston Villa back in January.
