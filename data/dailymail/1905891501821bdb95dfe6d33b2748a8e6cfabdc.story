Celebrities including Rihanna have come out in support of a children's charity facing a backlash over over a You Tube video targeting an African Warlord.

Invisible Children posted a 30 minute documentary about the actions of brutal African warlord Joseph Kony, whose bloodthirsty Lord's 
Resistance Army has terrorised parts of east and central Africa for 25 
years, on the website.

But as accusations emerge that the non-profit organisation spent the vast majority of its donations on film production, staff salaries and transport in producing the You Tube viral, several celebrities have lent their name to the cause.

Rihanna, pictured at this year's Grammy Awards, has called Invisible Children to discuss helping the charity while other celebs including rapper P Diddy, chat show queen Oprah Winfrey and Justin Bieber have also voiced interest in the campaign

The aim of the campaign is to raise awareness of Joseph Kony, the leader of the Lord's Resistance Army in Uganda

Campaigners want to see an end to Kony's brutal rebellion in Uganda

In the YouTube video 'KNOY 2012', producers beg 
for celebrity support to raise awareness and showed a picture of 
Rihanna, in an effort to get her involved.

And the plea seems to have worked, 
with Rihanna contacting the charity this week expressing an interest in 
creating another video to keep the momentum against Kony going, 
according to American website TMZ.

Other celebrities including rapper P 
Diddy, chat show queen Oprah Winfrey and Justin Bieber have also voiced 
interest in the campaign.

The Twitter hashtags #stopkony and 
#kony2012 were yesterday trending worldwide as campaigners sought to 
increase international pressure for the killer to be caught with the 
viral video that has now been viewed 26million times.

But some experts are still questioning Invisible Children's 
motives and charitable record.

Joseph Kony launched his guerilla army in 1987 but the group has no political aim.

He claims to be fighting under God's orders to establish a society based on the Bible's Ten Commandments.

He has led a campaign of fear throughout northern Uganda and neighbouring countries.

The organisation is believed to have murdered tens of thousands of people, abducted at least 30,000 children to work as sex slaves or soldiers and forced more than 1.5million people to flee their homes.

The brutal campaign has forced millions to live in fear and sees families in some areas abandoning their rural homes at night to sleep in makeshift refugee camps.

Kony and several of his leading lieutenants were indicted in 2005 by the International Criminal Court for crimes against humanity.

The group's founders, who support 
military action against Kony, have also been criticised for offering 
support to the armies of Sudan and Uganda despite claims both have been 
involved in rape and looting.

Despite the controversy, the KONY 2012
 video was this week appearing to achieve the group's stated aim of 
raising awareness about the warlord.

The 50-year-old Ugandan launched his 
guerilla army in 1987 and claims to be fighting under God's orders to 
establish a society based on the Bible's Ten Commandments.

His ruthless LRA, which has no political aim, has led a campaign of fear throughout northern Uganda and neighbouring countries.

About 100 U.S. troops were sent to Uganda to help in the pursuit of Kony and his followers

The group operated for more than a 
decade in northern Uganda but left in 2008 and have since committed 
atrocities in Sudan, Democratic Republic of Congo and the Central 
African Republic.

Uganda's army has theoretically hunted
 the organisation's leaders but Kony has continually evaded capture - at
 times arrogantly even emerging from the jungle to give interviews to 
journalists before disappearing again.

Last October American president Barack Obama announced he was sending troops to help the hunt for the LRA.

Around 100 US soldiers have since been deployed in the region to help local officials trace the mass killer.
