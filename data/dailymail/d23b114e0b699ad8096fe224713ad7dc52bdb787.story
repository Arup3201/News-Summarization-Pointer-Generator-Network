A mother says she returned home from the school run to find a gaping hole in her new extension after the new £14,000 windows had been removed and 'held hostage' by fitters in a row over payment.

Phoebe Oliver, 40, says she and her husband James had paid for the floor to ceiling windows to be installed in the annex of their home in Brighton, east Sussex.

But when the mother-of-three returned home from taking their children to school last week she was shocked to find they had vanished, and there was a gaping hole where the windows had been.  

Phoebe Oliver (pictured) returned home from the school run to find a gaping hole in her new extension after the £14,000 windows had been removed and 'held hostage' by fitters in a row over payment. She has written this message on the windows herself - police say no crime has been committed and it is a civil matter

Mrs Oliver, who runs a PR firm and is also a fitness coach, had paid in full for the windows in November, but the bi-fold doors were later removed by the company which had installed them as part of a dispute between the firm and two other companies.

Now the windows are being 'held hostage' at the warehouse of  window and door specialist Sussex Bifold Doors, which says it will hold them until the firm has been paid by the other companies involved.

'This is just unbelievable,' she said. 'I took the kids on the school run and came home to find my windows had vanished. On a freezing cold winter day.

'And I have done absolutely nothing wrong. The bill for the windows was settled months ago when I paid the builders doing the job. The argument here is between a load of builders who I don't even know.

Sussex Bifold Doors installed the windows, and says it will not return them until the firm is paid. Mrs Oliver has written this message on the board herself. The police have made it clear that no crime was committed, and the dispute over the windows is a civil matter

Fitness coach Mrs Oliver, who also runs a PR firm, had wanted to use the new annex as a gym

'Yet they thought they had the right to simply turn up unannounced while I was out and, for want of better word, steal my new bi-fold windows. It is outrageous.

'I was left looking at nothing but fresh air where the windows should have been. I was only out of the house for a couple of hours at most.'

Mrs Oliver, who planed to use the annex as a gym area for her fitness coaching, paid for the windows to be installed at her £730,000 four-bedroom home with inheritance money she was left by her father.

'What makes this worse is the fact I used the money my dear father left me for the work when he died,' she said.

'I felt an emotional attachment to the improvements I was making anyway and this has been a terrible way to treat someone who had paid in full.

'I feel like these people trespassed on my property without my permission and its an awful feeling, like they have violated my property and my family. I have three kids, two under 11 years of age, and I feel very vulnerable now.'

Mrs Oliver says she paid in full for the work three months ago. She hired a building firm, who in turn hired another company to source the windows from Sussex Bifold Doors, which installed them

Mr Oliver visited the Sussex Bifold Doors warehouse in nearby Lancing to try and get the windows returned but was told by company staff they were holding them until the dispute was concluded.

A scuffle ensued which led to Mr Oliver being arrested and ordered to pay a £90 fine. He also accidentally broke his foot in the incident and spent the night in hospital.

Mrs Oliver has contacted Sussex Police who said it was a civil matter. She has also contacted lawyers over legal action to get her windows back.

Now the annexe has been boarded up as Mrs Oliver tried to recover her windows.

A spokesman for Sussex Bifold Doors said it would be keeping the windows until paid in full by the builders involved.

Brighton-based builders Armstrong White, who were paid by Mrs Oliver, claim they paid a Brighton sub-contractor D and L Property Maintenance to source the windows from Sussex Bifold Doors.

Lee Clowes, director of D and L, said: 'I am caught in the middle of an akward situation and the windows are really nothing to do with me.' He said he had not been paid by Armstrong White. 

Armstrong White have since returned to the house to secure the building. 

Mrs Oliver added: 'How can it be right for someone just to turn up and take what I have paid for while I am out taking my kids to school.

'It is just a disgraceful state of affairs. I think they thought they were dealing with a woman who would be intimidated. I am deeply upset by this but I won't let them get away with it.'
