A social media consultant who claimed she was attacked for wearing Google Glass last month, was accused two years ago by neighbors of secretly recording them, court documents have revealed.

Sarah Slocum was served a restraining order in August 2012 after admitting to secretly pointing her smartphone at her neighbors’ open window in Santa Cruz, California and recording their conversation.

Jessie Lilley Campbell told CBS San Francisco she has made her scuffle with Slocum public 'because I wanted people to know that Sarah Slocum is no victim'.

Campbell said she and her husband David Campbell have since relocated to another part of Santa Cruz, even though the restraining order against Slocum is still in effect, just to 'get away from her'.

Court action: Slocum's former neighbors, Jessie Lilley and David Campbell, took a restraining order out against Slocum in 2012 which is still in effect

Slocum, however, maintains the recording she made was from a place that was legal and she did it because her 'hippy biker neighbors' were talking about her.

Slocum, 34, was living on a cabin on the same property as the Campbells, Baltimore Sun reported.

'It was a spat with 
neighbors. That lady also recorded her husband (with her 
cellphone) chasing a friend of mine with an axe,' Slocum told CBS San Francisco.

'I walked by their place on the way to my cabin, their window was open 
and I could hear them from the driveway. I heard them talking about me 
and conspiring against me so I started recording to capture what they 
were saying so that I could show it to my friends and family.' '

Slocum gained internet notoriety last month after claiming she was attacked at Molotov's, a punk rock bar in San Francisco.

She said a small group of people began to insult her and shout obscenities because of she was wearing Google Glass.

'They called me a bitch, they yelled, ‘F*** Google!'' Slocum said. 'One of the women shouted, ‘you guys are killing the city'.'

She filmed at least two people attacking her, including a man who allegedly ripped the Glass off her face.

She said also said a woman flipped her middle finger and invaded her personal space.

Slocom claimed she was simply showing friends how to use the new technology when the attack happened out of the blue.

However, a witness, Brian Lester, told CBS San Francisco that Slocum was being irritating, filming people on the device without their consent.

'The crowd was jeering as any last call crowd would do with a fight outside of a bar,' Lester said.

'She was running around very excited ... and people were telling her, 'you're being an *** take those glasses off'.

'I think everybody was just upset that she would be recording outside of a bar this late with obvious embarrassing behavior going on. And just rather insulted that someone thinks it's okay to record them the entire time they're in public.'

The altercation came just a week after Google released a list of dos and don'ts for Glass users including 'don't be creepy or rude (aka, a 'Glasshole').'
