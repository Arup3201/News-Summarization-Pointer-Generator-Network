Big beards are out and the clean shaven look is in, according to new figures on the booming sales of male shaving tools.

Prickly hugs and kisses and embarrassing eating situations look set to be a thing of the past, as men ditch the caveman look and embrace their inner gentleman. 

The trend for well-groomed facial hair is on the rise, as Debenhams have reported a 24 per cent increase in sales of electrical grooming products such as high tech facial hair stylers and electric shavers.

Uplifts suggest that men have ditched the 'Hipster Beard' trend for a more clean-cut look. 

Bosses at the department store, which released the statistics, have attributed this increase to the clean shaven look sported by Hollywood actors such as Ben Affleck and George Clooney, who have both recently ditched their big beards in favour of a more refined and polished appearance. 

This bucks the big beards trend most recently sported by television presenter Jeremy Paxman, who caused a twitter storm after appearing on Newsnight back in August with a full grey beard.

Sara Stern, Beauty Director at Debenhams said 'Men are seeking to replicate the well groomed look seen recently on a host of high profile celebrities by maintaining their facial hair and paying more attention to skincare. 

'The recent launch of male and unisex make-up shows just how seriously men are taking their grooming habits.'

Professor Karen Pine, a psychologist from the University of Hertfordshire, said: 'Humans are social animals and rely on subtle cues from facial expressions to understand each other.

'Too much facial hair can conceal the expressions, giving the impression that the man is inscrutable or has something to hide. 

'Research does show that men with full beards are viewed as fatherly; it lends gravitas and tends to make them look older.

'But women find men with neatly-trimmed stubble or a clean-shaven look more attractive.'

A recent survey conducted by the high street retailer confirms this switch with one in five UK males admitting to spending more than £100 per month to maintain their looks, the most popular products being soothing shave gels and luxurious post shave moisture balms.

Three out of every five UK males also claimed to follow a daily skincare routine.

Facial fuzz aficionado and 
photographer Jonathan Daniel Pryce, who runs the hit blog 100 Beards 100
 Days, says: 'The research is interesting but I think it indicates a 
more groomed beard rather than a removal of it,',

'If
 you look at any big male grooming brand they're releasing products for 
grooming lengthy beards - very few are innovating in the wet shave 
arena. Men are just not interested in a wet shave, clean look at the 
moment.

'If you consider models like Johnny Harrington, Ricki Hall or Aiden Shaw, their careers only peaked after they had a beard. Many of them booked their biggest campaigns including Harrods, Liberty and John Lewis once they had facial hair. Also there are endless tumblr blogs and tribute pages online to these models - it seems the beard has reached worship-status.

'When chatting with the men I photograph, they all tell me how their pulling power has gone through the roof since embracing the hirsute. It's a trend that I don't think will be going anywhere for a few years yet.'

Jonathan has just finished his new bumper-edition book 100 Beards, available to preorder on 
100beards.bigcartel.com and in independent retailers from November.

Beard blogger Incredibeard agrees: 'Beards have never been dead.

'I've said it before, and I'll say it again, a beard is the longest lasting fashion trend in human history.

'What we are seeing is merely the reemergence of manhood. Many corporations have put a lot of money into propagating the lie that shaving is the proper look of a man.

'Now that the truth has finally coming out beards are once again becoming popular and are gaining acceptance back into mainstream cultures throughout the world.'
