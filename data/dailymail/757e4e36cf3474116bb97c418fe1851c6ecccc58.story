A pair of trick handcuffs which let escape artist Harry Houdini fool the world with his death-defying stunts will be auctioned next week.

The restraints, made of cast iron, were a vital prop in Mr Houdini's Chinese water torture escape. The performer would amaze audiences by escaping from the handcuffs and a set of wooden stocks while submerged.

But decades after his death a fellow magician discovered that the devices had been altered so that they could easily be slipped off, allowing the Hungarian illusionist to escape impossible situations.

Tricked: Experts believed Mr Houdini used heat to alter the locking mechanism and allow him to escape the handcuffs

Shackled: The handcuffs were once owned by Harry Houdini, pictured who would amaze audiences in the early 20th century with his stunning escapes

Billy McComb analysed the rusty handcuffs, once owned by Mr Houdini's brother  Theo Hardeen, in the 1960s and found the secret behind his illusions.

It is believed that when Mr Houdini first put the shackles on he heated them over an open flame which loosened the spring mechanism inside.

When they were placed onto his wrists and held upright they would securely lock, but when they were turned upside down they would snap open.

The item, believed to be the first specially-altered pair to reach the market, is expected to fetch some £3,000 by auctioneers Bloomsbury on 12 December.

The auction also features a pair of Mr Houdini's leg restraints, and a padlock owner by the illusionist.

Locked up: This pair of Mr Houdini's leg restraints is also up for sale next week

Mike Heseltine, specialist in conjuring and performing arts at Bloomsbury, said: 'Houdini started using handcuffs in his routines from 1895.

'He did a variety of water stunts and it is a possibility that these handcuffs could have been used in the Chinese Water Tortune trick, which was seriously dangerous.

'This pair have been altered so they unlock when manouvered in a certain way, and this is the first time I have heard of him using handcuffs like this.

'There is no secret mechanism and they lock in the normal way, but it is thought that when he was wearing them he heated them up which relaxed the pressure on the spring.

'This meant that when they were on they would be locked, but if they were manouvered in a certain way they would come open as a security measure.

'He would have needed to have that precaution to make sure he could get out. The audience wouldn't have known because his tricks were done in a matter of seconds.

'I haven't ever seen anything before like this or heard of any handcuffs of his that have been altered, so these are very rare. I expect these will sell to a private collector.'
