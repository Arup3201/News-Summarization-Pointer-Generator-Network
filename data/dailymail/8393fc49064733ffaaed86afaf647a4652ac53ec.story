Police in Indianapolis are searching for the mother who dumped the body of her newborn daughter wrapped in a college sweatshirt in a wooded area of a city park.

Officers were called to Eagle Creek Park on the outskirts of Indianapolis by a person who found the baby while hiking Sunday afternoon.

Investigators say the baby was perhaps a day old and her umbilical cord still attached.

The horrific discovery was made under a branch about 30 yards from a parking area of the park on the city's northwest side.

Swaddled and left for dead: A deceased newborn baby girl was found in an Indianapolis park wrapped in this blue sweatshirt emblazoned with the logo of Aviation Maintenance Vincennes University-Indianapolis

Horrifying find: A hiker came upon the baby with her umbilical cord still attached lying under a branch in Eagle Creek Park 

Emergency workers pronounced the girl dead at the scene on the 3,900-acre park's northern edge at around 4.30pm.

According to police, the newborn was found swaddled in a blue sweatshirt with a logo saying ‘Aviation Maintenance Vincennes University-Indianapolis.’

Indianapolis Metropolitan Police Department spokesman Christopher Wilburn said forensics investigators are using the clothing item to try and locate the mother.

‘We want to do what we can. It's very tragic. There may be some DNA on that sweatshirt,’ Wilburn told The Indy Channel.

The coroner said it is unknown whether the baby was born dead or alive at birth, and her gestational age has not yet been determined.

Additional tests will be performed to determine the cause and manner of death.

Location: The child was discovered about 30 yards from a parking area of the park on the city's northwest side

Officials say the mother had other options rather than to abandon her baby in the brush. 

The State of Indiana has had a law on the books since 2000 called the Safe Haven Infant Protection Act allowing a person to give up an unwanted child anonymously without fear of arrest or prosecution, reported WISH-TV.

A parent, family member, friend, minister or priest, social worker or any responsible adult may give up custody of a baby less than 30 days old to a hospital emergency room, fire station or police station in Indiana, so long as the child shows no signs of abuse. 

Anyone who recognizes the blue college sweatshirt or knows the whereabouts of the mother is being asked to call (317) 327-3475. Anyone wishing to remain anonymous can call Crime Stoppers at 262-TIPS (8477).
