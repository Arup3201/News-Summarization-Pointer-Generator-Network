A leading hedge fund boss is suing Apple demanding the world's richest technology company moves to unlock its vast $137bn cash holdings to stockholders after the share price fell by more than a third since September last year.

David Einhorn, boss of Greenlight Capital, said Apple, which has a current stock market value of $429.5bn, has a 'Depression-era' mentality that led it to hoard cash.

Around two-thirds of Apple's $137bn cash pile is held overseas, and repatriating it into the U.S. would incur a steep tax bill, a problem faced by many top American technology companies.

A magic wand? Hedge-fund boss David Einhorn, has filed suit against Apple saying the company needs to do more to unlock value for shareholders

Einhorn, a well-known short-seller, criticised Apple in an interview with CNBC saying it only investing in the safest, lowest-yielding securities.

His lawsuit targets a proposal by Apple to change its corporate charter which would stop it from issuing a type of high-yielding share which could pay out billions of dollars.

He urged Apple shareholders to vote against the plan at the company's annual meeting on February 27, and put forward a proposal of his own for the company to preffered stock with a perpetual 4 per cent dividend.

Labelling Apple shares 'utterly 
misvalued', at their current level, Einhorn said the company no longer 
needs to grow at the near-triple-digit rates of the past.

In an open letter to investors he said: 
'We understand that many of our fellow shareholders share our 
frustration with Apple's capital allocation policies.

'Apple has $145 per share of cash on its balance sheet. As a shareholder, this is your money.'

Einhorn claimed that for every $50 
billion in preferred stock that Apple gives away to shareholders, it 
could unlock $32 a share in value for investors.

But Apple hit back saying Einhorn's lawsuit over the shareholder proposal was misguided.

'Contrary to Greenlight's statements, 
adoption of Proposal #2 would not prevent the issuance of preferred 
stock,' it said in a statement.

'Currently, Apple's articles of 
incorporation provide for the issuance of 'blank check' preferred stock 
by the Board of Directors without shareholder approval.

'If Proposal #2 is adopted, our shareholders would have the right to approve the issuance of preferred stock.'

The lawsuit is Apple's first major 
challenge from an activist shareholder and comes as it grapples with a 
tumbling share price and mounting competition in the smartphone and 
tablet markets.

There are also growing concerns among 
potential investors about the company's ability to produce new 
breakthrough products in the post-Steve Jobs era.

Apple nearly went broke in the 1990s 
before Steve Jobs returned and engineered a sensational turnaround, with
products such as the iPhone and iPad that became must-haves for 
consumers around the world.

The company's near-death experience has led Apple to be exceptionally conservative with its cash.

Last
March, just months after Jobs' death, Apple responded to a barrage of 
investor criticism over its large cash hoard by initiating a quarterly 
cash dividend and a share buyback that would pay out $45 billion over 
three years.

At the time, Apple was sitting on $98 billion in cash.

Apple shares, which had fallen 35 
percent from the record high hit in mid-September through Wednesday, 
ended 3 percent higher at $468.22.

Einhorn, whose Greenlight fund had a 
sub-par year in large part because of Apple's late-2012 stock swoon, 
said the company needs to fix its 'cash problem'.

'It has sort of a mentality of a 
depression. In other words, people who have gone through traumas ... and
Apple has gone through a couple of traumas in its history, they 
sometimes feel like they can never have enough cash,' Einhorn said on 
CNBC.

Investors, who have long railed 
against what they saw as Apple's ultra-conservative attitude toward its 
cash, rallied around Einhorn in principle.

In an interview with Reuters, Einhorn 
said he had gone to Apple CEO Tim Cook in recent weeks after the 
company's chief financial officer, Peter Oppenheimer, brushed off his 
entreaties in September.

Hedge fund boss David Einhorn has a history
of activism, usually directed at struggling companies or those 
grappling with management issues.

In 2011, he urged Microsoft Corp to 
get rid of Chief Executive Steve Ballmer, accusing him of being 'stuck 
in the past'.

Einhorn slashed his stake in the software giant six months
later.

Einhorn has enjoyed something of a cult following in the 
$2 trillion hedge fund industry ever since his bearish call on Lehman 
Brothers in early 2008. But 2012 was not his best year.

Thanks to
losses on Apple and in the gold market, Greenlight Capital posted a 
modest 8.3 percent gain for the year after losing 2.8 percent in 
December, a person familiar with the fund's performance said. That 
lagged the S&P 500 index's 13.4 percent gain, excluding dividends.

You
could see Einhorn stirring up other activist investors, to twist them. I
would certainly applaud their efforts,' said Tim Lesko, portfolio 
manager at Granite Investment Advisors, which owns Apple stock.

Cook, who is rarely known to engage 
investors in exclusive conversations, was unaware of the earlier 
conversations with Oppenheimer, according to Einhorn.

'When I discussed this with Tim Cook,
and actually, the conversation has been going on for the last couple of
weeks, he said that he wasn't familiar with my previous conversations 
with Peter Oppenheimer and whoever Peter Oppenheimer's advisers were. I 
was surprised by that," Einhorn told Reuters.

Analysts have expected stockholder pressure to increase as Apple's share price declines and its outlook grows murkier.

The
California company had $137.1 billion in cash, short-term and long-term
marketable securities such as U.S. Treasuries at the end of 2012, with 
over $94 billion of that overseas.

'This
is something that we continuously assess, the opportunities to both 
invest in the business and return cash,' Apple's Oppenheimer said on the
company's post-results conference call last month.

'We do consider increasing these programs, and we'll do what we think is in the best interest of our shareholders.

It remains to be seen whether other major Apple investors will get behind Einhorn's initiative.

Mulholland
called the preferred stock idea 'Interesting and unique'. He also said 
he supported Einhorn's opposition to the shareholder proposal and would 
vote against it, saying, "There's no reason to put something like that 
in.'

On the flip side, the 
California Public Employees' Retirement System, which owns 2.7 million 
Apple shares, urged investors earlier this week to vote in favor of the 
shareholder proposal, and opposes 'blank check' preferred shares.

Money managers have complained that Apple stockpiles excessive cash and does a poor job putting it to work.

The weighted-average interest rate 
earned on its cash, cash equivalents and marketable securities came to 
just 1.07 percent in its 2013 fiscal first quarter and 1.02 percent in 
the 2012 fiscal year.

Some questioned whether taking the company to court was the right way to induce action.

'If you own the company you should let management have some say in how they run it. I'm not a fan of using the legal system to address what should be a corporate issue,' said John Manley, chief equity strategist at Wells Fargo Advantage funds.

Jeffrey Manns, an associate professor of law at George Washington University, said Einhorn does have legal standing to bring his case, even though it has little precedent. Greenlight's lawsuit takes aim at what it calls the 'bundling' of several proposals into a single vote.

Greenlight wants the proposals separated so a vote can be taken specifically on Apple's move to strike preferred shares from its company charter. Greenlight alleges that Apple is not complying with U.S. Securities and Exchange Commission rules requiring separate votes for distinct and unrelated amendments to the charter.

'This procedural legal strategy is merely a vehicle to raise his profile and promote his agenda about shaping Apple's corporate strategy,' Manns said of Einhorn.

Einhorn's actions go well beyond increasingly common shareholder calls for Apple to increase its dividend or buy back shares.

Einhorn argues preferred stock - 
which functions like a bond in that it pays a fixed dividend over time -
is a better route because the company won't have to use cash right 
away.

Analysts say another benefit is up to
80 per cent of the dividends from preferred stock can be tax-free for 
corporate investors, and it is not logged as debt on the balance sheet.

But the tactic is generally pursued by low-growth companies, where capital gains are less assured.

'The idea is powerful, and when I have
a chance to explain it to the shareholders, most will see it as an 
enormous win-win', Einhorn told Reuters.

Einhorn said he suggested
to Apple an initial preferred share distribution, in which dividends 
could be funded on an ongoing basis by a relatively small percentage of 
the company's operating cash flow.

'Apple rejected the idea outright in 
September 2012,' he said, and then refused to withdraw the proposal to 
eliminate preferred stock from its charter.

Some investors saw 
merit in Einhorn's argument. 'It's a great company but their greatest 
weakness is capital allocation,' said Mark Mulholland, portfolio manager
of the $417 million Matthew 25 fund, which has some 17 per cent of his 
portfolio in Apple.
