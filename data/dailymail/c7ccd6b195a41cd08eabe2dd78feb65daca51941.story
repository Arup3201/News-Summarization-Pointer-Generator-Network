Manchester United frontman Robin van Persie gave the thumbs up following his first day back at training.

The striker has enjoyed an extended break having helped Holland reach the semi-finals of this summer's World Cup in Brazil and seemed glad to be back in the North West on Monday afternoon.

Earlier in the day, Van Persie tweeted: 'Back in training today after a short break. Looking forward to the new season sooo much!! Hope you all feeling the same.'

All set to work with compatriot and former national team boss Louis van Gaal at Old Trafford this term, Van Persie appears confident for the season ahead.

However, United's talisman, who turns 31 next week, will delay his start to the Premier League season in order to improve his fitness after missing Manchester United’s Stateside tour.Van Gaal says United's No 20 won’t be in the team to face Swansea City in his side’s opening game on August 16, even though his partnership with Wayne Rooney is seen as key to regaining a Champions League spot.

Having struggled to seventh place under David Moyes during the last campaign, United fans will perhaps share the striker's optimism with Van Gaal at the helm.

The Red Devils have already brought in Ander Herrera and Luke Shaw this summer and remain unbeaten on the club's tour of America.

Van Persie's team-mates take on arch-rivals Liverpool in Miami in the early hours of Tuesday morning BST in the International Champions Cup final.
