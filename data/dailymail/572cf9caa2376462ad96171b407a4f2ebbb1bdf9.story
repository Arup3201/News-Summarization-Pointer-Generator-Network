When radio legend Big George died in 2011, his partner of five years grieved for him ... and then for their relationship.

What his girlfriend Jo Good thought was an honest partnership was revealed to be a sham as the reality that he was still with his wife surfaced shortly after his passing.

George Webley, 53, who composed TV theme tunes for Have I Got News For You and The Office earned the nickname Big George, died after suffering a massive heart attack following taking the party drug mephedrone.

An affair to remember: When Big George Webley (pictured) died, the extent of his double life was revealed

The father-of-four from Stony Stratford, Buckinghamshire, was found struggling for breath at his home by his wife, Sheila in May 2011 and was pronounced dead when paramedics arrived.

A statement on the family website after his death said: 'Our hearts go out to all those who share our loss.'

What nobody was aware of, though, was that George had been living a double life, betraying the two women closest to him.

As far as Barking at the Moon radio show presenter Jo Good was concerned, he was separated and they were an official, public celebrity couple together.

But then she found out he hadn't left his wife and had been living a double life throughout their relationship.

The couple met at BBC Radio London and bonded 
over a mutual love of animals and the arts, and, after much convincing, 
Jo felt assured that while George lived in the family home he and his 
wife were living separate lives.

The couple even got two dogs together, 
nicknamed their 'furkids'. Jo admits this brought out maternal feelings 
she never thought she had.

George had convinced Jo he and his 'estranged' wife were not together and only crossed paths when he was visiting his children and grandchildren.

But George had been staying with wife Sheila with whom he was still very much together all along - and in fact Jo had been the other woman.

For Jo, being labelled as the other woman immediately devalued her as his partner and - most devastatingly - devalued her allowance to grieve.

Their relationship was effectively erased from his past.

Talking to The Mirror, Jo said: 'There's an aspect [to grieving] I'd never thought about until I lost my own 
soulmate - that there's some sort of scale of mourning and loss, and 
that one person's grief has more importance than another's.

'I'd been a
mistress for five years - even though I didn't know it - so when my 
beloved George died, my grief was of less value than that of his late 
wife,'

And so she felt she was not allowed to express her sadness like any loving partner should.

After his passing when the family home was emptied by relatives and Jo was not contacted once, George's real situation became clear.

'I discovered George had left his locker 
at work open. Inside I found an envelope filled with hundreds of 
photos... every one he'd taken of us and put up in the flat,' she says of discovering yet another relic of his betrayal.

While Jo didn't attend his official funeral out of respect for his family, she did join John Kennedy and 300 others on the steps of All Souls Church next to Broadcasting House to celebrate George's life.

Jo still has unanswered questions. She said: 'Now I have nothing but memories and a few treasured photos of the man who was my life for five years. I could have coped with being a mistress. I believed his "separate lives" story, but had I discovered the truth when he was still alive I would have shared him.'
