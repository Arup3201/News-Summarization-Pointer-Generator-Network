Tammy Lynn Hankins has four children and works as a physician's assistant

A mother of four has been jailed for three and half years for having sex with a friend of her teenage children.

Tammy Lynn Hankins had sex dozens of times with a 16-year-old student - leading to him being nicknamed 'Legend' by his friends.

The teen told police he slept with the 43-year-old Tammy Lynn Hankins at various homes in the Lake Havasu area of Arizona near the California state line.

He also said she bought him alcohol, a water bong and a video game and told him to deny they had sex if they were ever caught.

Hankins is a physician's assistant who used to be married to a plastic surgeon - though the couple have since divorced. 

When he jailed her for three and half years, Judge Derek Carlisle told her most of the sentence was for violating probation for a previous drug conviction by having sex with the teen.

Judge Carlisle added on another year for the sexual relations, according to the Las Vegas Review Journal.

Carlisle said society might apply a double standard when comparing men having sex with girls to women having sex with boys, but he said the prison sentence reflects that the law makes no such distinction.

According to a police report the boy's father was puzzled why his son's friends referred to him as 'Legend,' the Arizona Independent reports.

It was only after the arrest of Hankins that he understood why his son was given the moniker by his school friends.

Gossip about Hankins and the teen circulated among other teens at Lake Havasu High School, where authorities heard about the relationship. 

Hankins was on probation for prescription medication fraud at the time of the affair with the student. Most of her three-and-a-half-year prison sentence was a result of violating her probation

Detective Tom Gray investigated the rumors and conducted interviews with the victim and Hankins last December.

The teen said he had sex with Hankins in three different homes between late July and early November, 2013.

'He does not remember specifics about each time but he had sexual intercourse with Tammy between two dozen and three dozen times,' Gray wrote in an arrest report.

Hankins also told him to deny everything if anybody asked about what was happening, the boy said.

Hankins, a physician's assistant, admitted having sex with the teen eight to ten times.

She told the detective she initially resisted the boy's advances but after a row with her boyfriend gave in and had sex.

Hankins told Gray she did not know the boy was 16 years old until there was police involvement.

Hankins also admitted purchasing a $200 bong and a Grand Theft Auto 5 game for her alleged teen lover.

The items cannot legally be purchased by anyone under 18.

Hankins admitted buying alcohol for the teen.

Shewas found guilty of four counts of sexual conduct with a minor and one count of furnishing obscene or harmful items to a minor.
