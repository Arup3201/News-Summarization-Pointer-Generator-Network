Sir Cameron Mackintosh, above, planned the demolition of the former village hall and the erection of retail space for food and drink units

Theatre impresario Sir Cameron Mackintosh's plans to renovate a harbour in his highland village has caused bitter division after residents accused him of planning to destroy local trade.

Sir Cameron is said to have been 'deeply hurt' over claims his £750,000 coastal development in Mallaig would ruin local business.

The theatre mogul, behind hit shows such as Phantom of the Opera, Cats and Les Miserables is now threatening to pull out of building new marina facilities after the outcry by locals.

Plans by the entertainment tycoon - estimated to be worth £725m, placing him second on the Sunday Times Rich List of UK music millionaires - include the erection of a food outlet.

But locals say Mallaig already has too many restaurant and fear the competition.

Sir Cameron, 66, has sparked fierce debate over the site, which includes his own private pier.

It involves the demolition of the former village hall and the building of marina facilities, flats, shops, restaurants and bars.

It is due to be heard by Highland Council in the New Year.

But already many locals have lodged official objections and even organised a petition.

Taste of Scotland award winner Michele Milligan of The Steam Inn said: 'How in God's name is another one (food outlet) going to benefit anyone? You say 'it will provide jobs' I say I will need to pay off staff as there won't be enough to go around!

'Think bout (sic) this from our point of view! We graft all year I employ 18 staff which is all year if the business has a downturn I will have to reduce full time workers so another competitor can employ seasonal workers. 

'By all means renovate what existing buildings are there and clean the place up! If Mr Macintosh wants to invest money do it wisely and not to the detriment of all ready struggling businesses !!'

Overhaul: The harbour of Mallaig in the Scottish Highlands, above, has become the subject of fierce debate after locals claimed Sir Cameron's plans would 'destroy' local trade

Cafe owners Linda and Peter McLean wrote that 'having new retail, catering and carryout facilities would be to the detriment of existing businesses within the village - these businesses are mainly locally owned and provides much needed employment to local people.'

Bed and breakfast owner John Summers added: 'At present I have a partial view of the marina but if the food and drink outlet goes ahead we will have no view of the bay at all.

'There are already ten locally run restaurants eight of which do takeaways I am quite sure we don't need another.'

Charlie King, the vice chairman of the Mallaig Harbour Authority - who will gain new toilets and shower facilities out of the development - said an 'upset' Sir Cameron had telephoned him last week.

'He had received an email from one of the objectors claiming that he was destroying the village. It really annoyed him. He says he is spending £750,000 on helping the village', said Mr King.

'He has taken the criticism badly. He has received quite a few personal attacks over this and he said to me that 'if they don't want it he does not need to do it.' He will never make money in his lifetime from this.

Investment: The theatre impresario has already invested in the area, part paying for this health centre close to the coast

'Cameron has been very hurt over it. He is very annoyed - here's somebody willing to spend £750,000 to do some good and he is expected to take these attacks that he is destroying a place he loves on the nose? Cameron has done so much good for the area over the years - he deserves better than this.'

Mr King, who used to be the Highland councillor for the area added he agreed that Mallaig had too many restaurants, but Sir Cameron had told him he was going to drop the restaurant from the plans and replace it with a bakery.

Andrew Aitchison, the estate's agent, said they were talking to objectors to try and overcome their concerns.

'Though there will be some form of food outlet we are not proposing a restaurant' said Mr Aitchison.

'We have been speaking to various parties to clarify the situation which is certainly not to commit anything detrimental to other business but would complement those already there and bring even more trade.

'Unless there was strong support in the majority of the community, Sir Cameron would not proceeded against the wishes of the majority of the village.

'Sir Cameron's motivation has been to help and provide facilities which will improve Mallaig and make it sustainable.

'If the village community are supportive we will crack on. I think any planning application tends to draw objections. There is strong support along the majority but we recognise that some of the local businesses have concerns.'
