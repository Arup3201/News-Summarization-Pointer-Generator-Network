Rioting hooligans could soon be repelled by police officers brandishing a futuristic ‘sound blaster’ weapon.

Government officials are considering a bizarre 21st century device that projects a powerful beam of sound up to 400ft.

Those targeted said it creates a ‘very nasty’ siren-like sound in their heads which made their brain feel like it is ‘rattling around’.

Home Office boffins said they are ‘very interested’ in the acoustic weapon which is being developed by a British firm.

It has already been shown off at several police conferences, including one in the US attended by Met chief Sir Bernard Hogan-Howe.

At another, in Ryton, near Coventry, in November, several of the country’s most senior officers took part in an outdoor demonstration.

One of the unofficial guinea pigs said: ‘It looks like a comedy gun but the effect is certainly not funny at all.

‘It felt like there was something inside my head, I felt a bit nauseous, and all I wanted to do was get away from it.’

An urgent search for a new generation of non-lethal weapons to help quell violence was sparked by the ugly scenes of the 2011 summer riots.

Tests of a long-range CS gas or pepper spray gun, which could be fired over 100ft, are in their final stages.

And three water cannon are likely to be purchased for use on the British mainland within months at a cost of more than £3m.

Some senior officers believe the ‘acoustic distraction device’ could add another option to the police armoury.

They believe it will be particularly useful to deter people who gather at riots but are not involved in the most serious violence and disorder.

Its manufacturers also believe it could be used in prisons, to protect convoys and even as a distraction device in hostage situations.

Shaped like an over-sized sci-fi gun, the yellow and black device can be strapped across the user’s chest and emits a ‘very intense’ sound beam.

The specific wavelength of the beam fools the brain into thinking that the sound is much louder than it really is.

Officials believe the maximum safe exposure is 115 decibels, equal to a power saw or rock concert, over the period of a minute.

The weapon comes with a laser sight, display indicating length of exposure and battery life and a video camera which records images of who it is used against.

It is being developed by Cerberus Black, which named the weapon A-WASP, Acoustic Warning Signal Projector.

The company was founded in 2009 to market and sell technology created by Cambridge University and a specialist acoustics firm.

It has received funding from the Ministry of Defence, via its counter terrorism centre, and hope to begin selling devices within months.

Officials at the Home Office’s Centre for Applied Science and Technology are preparing to test the sound gun.

One senior member said: ‘It’s a very interesting innovation and one that we are looking forward to testing fully.

‘Anything that can help police disperse violent crowds without using traditional methods of force is of great interest to us.’

Matt Henry, of Cerberus Black, said the weapon can be used for crowd control and ‘conflict management’.

He said it ‘sounds like the worst siren you've ever heard.’ He added: ‘It gives you an impression it's inside your head.

‘We are still developing it and the reason we are still getting feedback from the police. It’s not available for sale at the moment.’

A Home Office spokesman said: ‘We constantly consider and review less lethal options which may be suitable for the police to use.

‘All equipment is subject to a rigorous testing and approval process including technical, medical and operational evaluations before it is considered for use.’
