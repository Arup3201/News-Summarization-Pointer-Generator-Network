A good Samaritan braved the freezing waters of Lake Michigan risking his own safety to rescue a confused dog wandering on ice floats.

Spotting Pifas, a three-year-old stranded golden retriever mix half-a-mile out on the lake, Dave Kehnast, 37, didn't think twice about donning his wetsuit and jumping aboard his kayak to rescue the stricken dog on Friday.

As the Chicago Fire Department went through safety procedures, Kehnast cut through the ice with his raft and herded the dog back to shore through the perishing waters of the lake off the Loyola Park section of Chicago.

News cameras captured the heartwarming rescue at 4.30 p.m. on Friday - which included hand-in-mouth moments as Pifas the dog fell into the water on occasion, clearly struggling with exhaustion.

'I was up on the fire escape there on the seventh floor up there and I saw him way out there and so I grabbed the kayak over here and I know that the lake is only a couple of feet deep all the way out to where the ice shelf ends so I knew I'd be fine,; Kehnast explained to Fox News.

'And so I grabbed the kayak and went out there.'

Lost by owner Nerijus Steponavicius over a week before while out on a walk, Pifas was hungry and confused when Kehnast made his rescue.

Chicago Fire Department officers also attempted to encourage Pifas the dog to make his way to shore

'I just kept encouraging him, ‘here boy, here boy, here boy' said Kehnast.

'I got really close to him and he wanted to bite me so I just stayed on me and at that point I could get into the water and just hustled him along.

'I wanted to just grab him because it was shallow enough where I could stand, and I just wanted to get my hands on him but he wanted to bite me, it looked like. He didn't want anyone touching him.'

In fact, once the dog reached safe ground after the hour-long ordeal, he took off running. He took off from there, escaping authorities as he ran around nearby apartment complexes.

Eventually crews caught up with the exhausted dog and ushered it into the back of a white utility van - from where it was taken to an animal shelter.

Owner Nerijus Steponavicius had lost his dog over a week before the dramatic rescue on Friday

'We responded and found the dog quite a distance offshore, maybe close to half a mile off shore, running around on the icebergs out there and falling through to the open water,' said Chicago Fire Department Deputy District Chief Ron Dorneker to NBC News.

'We used a helicopter to try and move the dog a little closer to shoreline, we brought a boat in.'

Dog and owner are due to reunited on Sunday after Steponavicius heard from family that his dog had starred on the afternoon news.

As the rescue attempt was caught on live television, Steponavicius, of Wicker Park, said his cell phone was ringing non-stop, from calls from people who recognized the dog.

Rushing to the Department of Animal Care and Control, Steponavicius was told he couldn't be reunited with Pifas because he was not neutered, an operation carried out yesterday.

Once he was back on shore - Pifas was still so confused that he made off and went running around - and had to be caught be emergency workers

However, Pifas was pleased to see his owner.

'He’s really shy, so when he saw me he started jumping around in the cage,' said Steponavicius with a huge smile.

'The biggest lesson, once again: keep those dogs on leashes along the lakefront in the wintertime,' said Chicago Fire Department Deputy District Chief Ron Dorneker.

'This is what can happen when they get out there on that ice and they fall through and they get a distance off-shore.'

For hero Kehnast, he said he simply could not have just watched the dog flounder on the ice.

'I wanted the dog to live just like any other person out here watching him,' said Kehnast.

'I have the gear, I have the equipment, I would have been beating myself up if I had just sat there.'
