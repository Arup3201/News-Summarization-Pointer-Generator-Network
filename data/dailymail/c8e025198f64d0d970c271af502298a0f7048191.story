China's Jade Rabbit Moon rover is experiencing mechanical problems and may not be able to finish its mission.

The six-wheeled Yutu vehicle began operating last month after making the first soft landing on the moon by a space probe in 37 years.

It was designed to roam the lunar surface for three months while surveying for natural resources and sending back data, along with its stationary lander, Chang'e 3.

The soft-landing of the Chang'e 3 lander in December made China the third country to complete a lunar rover mission after the United States and Russia

The mission has been a popular success for China's space programme and the rover has attracted more than 150,000 followers on its microblog.

It last posted on Saturday saying repairs were underway and hope was not lost.

‘Sorry to make you all sad. The engineers and I haven't given up yet,’ the posting said.

News of the rover's troubles were splashed across Chinese newspapers on Monday and even featured at the Foreign Ministry's daily briefing.

The potential to extract the moon's resources has been touted as a key reason behind Beijing's space programme.

The moon is believed to hold uranium, titanium, and other mineral resources, as well as offering the possibility of solar power generation.

'China wants to go to the moon for geostrategic reasons and domestic legitimacy,' said China space expert Joan Johnson-Freese, a professor of national security affairs at the U.S. Naval War College in Newport, Rhode Island.

'With the U.S. exploration moribund at best, that opens a window for China to be perceived as the global technology leader - though the U.S. still has more, and more advanced, assets in space.'

The problems appeared to be related to the solar-powered probe's process for shutting down for the lunar night, which lasts more than two weeks.

The temperature during that time drops to minus 180 °C.

The probe had survived its first shutdown, during which it is unable to generate energy from its solar panels and relies on a radioactive power source to keep its delicate sensors and other equipment intact.

The rover was traversing a relatively flat part of the moon known as Sinus Iridum, or the Bay of Rainbows, at a speed of 200 yards per hour.

The landing vehicle, which has already shut down for the lunar night, is designed to conduct scientific examinations for one year.

Online speculation focused on the possibility of lunar dust having blocked one of the solar panels from folding inward, leaving equipment exposed to the dangerously low temperatures.

It will not be known if the probe is able to function again until after the two-week break.

China's space programme has made steady progress since the country launched its first manned spacecraft in 2003.

It has launched a lunar orbiter, conducted space walks, and put into orbit a prototype space station, to be replaced by a permanent station at the end of the decade.

Already a source of enormous national pride, the programme has increasingly sought to connect with the public through social media and educational outreach.

China's second woman in space, Wang Yaping, conducted China's first space classroom to students nationwide from the prototype space station, the Tiangong.

Yutu, or ‘Jade Rabbit,’ is named after a mythological Chinese animal said to live on the moon.
