A social worker on St Helena who claims she was forced to resign after authorities failed to tackle ‘appalling’ child sexual abuse on the island will have her shocking allegations probed by an independent investigation, Mail Online can reveal.

The social services manager, who has asked not to be named, said she was shocked when she arrived on the British overseas territory by the sheer volume of sexual abuse allegations.

But she claims she was harassed and threatened when she blew the whistle on the alleged failure of police to properly investigate such crimes.

The Foreign and Commonwealth Office has promised an independent investigation will be launched into the social worker's claims about St Helena

Now the Foreign and Commonwealth Office has promised an independent investigation will be launched into her claims.

The probe comes after Mail Online revealed that a report by UK child protection charity The Lucy Faithfull Foundation found St Helena was rife with child sexual abuse, domestic violence and sexual exploitation.

The charity was sent to the remote South Atlantic island by the British government, although the report was never released.

A spokeswoman for the FCO said: ‘These are extremely worrying allegations which we take very seriously.

‘In response, we are setting up a full and transparent investigation to be led by a senior independent figure and supported by a team of experts.’

The social services manager was recruited from the UK for her expertise and moved to St Helena in February 2013.

The mother-of-one said that, after talking to victims and health workers, she quickly learned that ‘paedophilia had become normal, it was the routine.’

She claimed the community and the authorities ‘had been turning a blind eye to it’ and expressed her frustration at trying to get historic closed cases re-opened.

She says she frequently clashed with police over how to deal with claims of child sex abuse, saying: ‘There is a very close expat community and they don’t want to disrupt the status quo.

‘It often felt like the police were trying to disprove cases, rather than find out the truth.’

The mother-of-one, who returned to the UK last month on leave and never returned, said she raised about 20 serious sexual abuse cases to the police during her 14 months on the island which had not been investigated when they were reported previously.

The manager said she believed corruption was ‘everywhere’ among the authorities on the island.

When she arrived she says she found child safeguarding was ‘in tatters’ and consisted of just two unqualified social workers.

She said some police officers treated her with hostility.

‘They did not want to be challenged over their failure to tackle certain known paedophiles’, she said.

‘I began to uncover significant unaddressed child abuse problems.

‘Paedophiles were found to be private foster carers. Staff were allowed to have sexual relationships with vulnerable adults. Reported rapes were not dealt with.

‘Paedophilia was not being tackled if it involved public officials or connected people. They were not being investigated or charged.’

She claims that she was constructively dismissed on 8 July 2014.

The manager said she had ‘no choice’ but to resign because she had been targeted by officials ever since whistleblowing to the Department for International Development (DFID) and the Foreign and Commonwealth Office (FCO) in March.

She was also threatened with perjury charges in relation to an adoption case – something she believes was done to ensure she would leave the island.

The whistleblower has now issued proceedings against the FCO and DFID at the employment tribunal, along with a fellow UK social worker who recently left the island.

The manager said cases were not thoroughly investigated and pointed to the case of a two-year-old child, now some years older, who was taken to hospital by her foster carer with a perforated bowel, bruising, hair loss and malnutrition.

Her foster carers claimed she had fallen off a rocking horse and the case was taken no further.

Despite presenting the case to the police when she was told about the girl, the manager said no further action has been taken.

She believes this was because the foster carer was a former public official on the island.

She said: ‘Her injuries were entirely consistent with violent physical and sexual abuse. The injuries were the equivalent of a child being hit by a car at 30 mph.

‘Two paediatricians said her injuries were consistent with abuse, but nothing was done about it because of who the foster carers were.’

The Lucy Faithfull Report, which found there had been an ‘evident failure’ by police to tackle sex offenders, was full of praise for the social services manager.

It found there was some ‘unhelpful attitudes’ about her on the island, while others said she had had not been on island long enough to appreciate ‘how things are done here’ and was like ‘a bull in a china shop’.

The charity disputed this, saying: ‘Our view was that her approach was correct, and that the expressed urgency was measured and proportionate, since cases had been mishandled and badly managed for some time, and changes in practice and the philosophy underlying practice were long overdue.’

The charity used an example of an incident while they were on the island where ‘a child’s complaint that she was sharing a bed with her foster father had not been acted upon’.

It said this became ‘sinister’ when the manager realised ‘the man had a previous conviction for child molestation’ for a victim of the same age and gender of the child.

The charity said that, while they were fully supportive of her approach, they ‘did not agree with the Chief of Police’s view that her practice amounted to ‘cold case reviews.’

The social services manager described a culture where the rape victims were often dismissed by locals as ‘asking for it’.

When a woman in her 20s came forward to report being repeatedly raped as a nine-year-old child by fishermen on the island, she was apparently shunned by her colleagues and the wider community.

She said: ‘They blamed her for it, even though she was only a child when it happened. They would say she dressed a certain way or came on to them.’

She said victims were terrified that if they reported a crime to a teacher, police officer or social workers, that these figures of authority would be related or friends with the attacker.

She said: ‘If you disclosed a crime, there was a fear the person you reported it to might be related.

‘They were worried about upsetting someone in a position of power. If they spoke out, no one would employ them in the community, and the benefits are not big enough to survive on.’

The manager also expressed concern that the creation of a new airport, which will cost UK taxpayers £246.6million, and opens in 2016, would ‘become a Gary Glitter type tour destination’, with child sex abuse 'effectively being financed by the British public’.

She said she feared paedophiles would flood to the island in search of an ‘easy target, because sexual abuse and grooming of young girls was widely accepted.

Facilities for children and adults with physical and learning disabilities were ‘horrific’, she said.

‘It was absolutely shocking and so incredibly depressing.

A spokeswoman for the FCO said: 'These are extremely worrying allegations which we take very seriously

‘A 15-year-old girl had been locked up in the unit since she was five-years-old. Most of the children did not have challenging behaviour but had learning difficulties.

‘One woman in her 30s had been there since she was a child when she was found neglected, another had autism and one woman was in there because she had been sexually abused by her step-father.

‘None of them should have been in there. It was heart-breaking.’

She said she immediately ordered staff to lock up a ‘padded cell’ for children at the so-called ‘challenging behaviour unit’ who ‘kicked off’, with mattresses attached to the walls.

An FCO spokesman said: ‘The independent inquiry is in response to allegations made to us on 9 July by former employees of the St Helena Government.’

Responding to the employment tribunal application, they said: ‘We have been named as the first respondent in an employment tribunal regarding two workers on St Helena.

‘Due to the ongoing legal situation it would be inappropriate to comment further.’

A spokesman for the St Helena government said: 'Child safeguarding is an absolute priority for St Helena Government, the FCO and DfID.

'Working together over recent years we have taken great steps on St Helena and Ascension Island in protecting children and the vulnerable against abuse of any kind.

'The number of successful prosecutions over the period, with substantial sentences handed down, illustrates this.'

They said the allegations made by the social worker were 'serious and will be examined'.

'With the UK Government we are setting up a full and transparent inquiry to investigate these claims and related matters.

'The inquriy will be led by a senior independent figure, supported by a team of experts.

'In view of this and because of the ongoing legal matters it would be inappropriate to comment further.'
