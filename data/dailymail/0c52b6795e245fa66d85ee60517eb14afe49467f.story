With more of us watching TV and using gadgets from our bed it was only a matter of time before  technology became part of the bedroom, inside mattresses and even bedsheets.

Images showing what the bedroom of the future could like have been created by London-based design scientist and futurist Melissa Sterry, and feature beds that monitor health as someone sleeps and bedsheets that can respond to changes in a sleeper's temperature.

One day there could even be a holographic companion that looks like a celebrity crush, such as Mr Darcy, and can read bedtime stories to soothe people to sleep.

In September, the National Sleep Foundation released its first international Bedroom Poll.

It compared the amount of sleep and attitudes, habits and bedtime routines of people living across the United States, Canada, Mexico, UK, Germany and Japan.

The results discovered that while a third of Britons prefer to sleep naked, Germans have to air their bedrooms weekly to achieve a good night's sleep and half of both Japanese and Americans take naps every two weeks to catch up on their shut eye.

The innovations in the futuristic designs were based on the results of a study carried out by The Sleep Council.

It asked more than 2,000 people what they most want to see in bedrooms of the future.

All the technologies are currently being worked on and developed in research centres across the UK in one form or another. 

The most-desirable technology, according to the study, was self-cleaning and bacteria-resistant mattresses that can sterilise germs at 47 per cent.

In second place, with 42 per cent of the votes, were mattresses and bedsheets fitted with adaptive materials able to heat up when its cold, and cool down automatically when its hot, in response to a person's body temperature. 

A third of people want to see smart beds that track vital statistics while a person sleeps, which can warn them if they have an infection, an oncoming cold and even if they're about to have a heart attack.

Lights that turn on during the winter months to help people wake up in the morning came in fourth at 32 per cent, with floors and fixtures that harvest reusable energy coming in fifth with 24 per cent of the votes.

Other ideas that aren't currently being developed but were still mentioned in the study included a hologram of Mr Darcy to read bedtime stories, and a bed that raises people to a standing position. 

The study also found 27 per cent of people now use computers in their bedrooms compared to only 11 per cent a decade ago.

Only 55 per cent of participants said they were intimate in their bedrooms with their partners, a 10 per cent drop from 10 years ago.

Reading is still one of the top bedroom activities coming out second in the things people do in their bedroom, second only to sleeping.

The research for The Sleep Council was carried out by Opinion Matters and sampled 2042 UK respondents.
