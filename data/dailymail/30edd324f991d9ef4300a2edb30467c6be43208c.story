'This is our largest event yet,' said the fun-filled event's organizer Lisa Scolman, 50, of Oceanside.

'It’s exciting to see where dog surfing is going and to see it growing and growing.'

Around 65 dogs hit the waves to compete for charity and competed in categories based on size and weight class.

One category was specifically designed for humans and their canine companions to surf together.

The dogs wore life-vests for safety as to make sure that they were safe when surfing up a storm for charity.

According the the competition's Facebook the winners in the small dog competition is a dog named Kiehi.

In the medium competition is a dog named Brandy.

In the large competition is a cute canine named Kalani.

In the extra large section the winner is a dog named Kona Kai.

Even though some dogs received titles, they are all winners for achieving the seemingly unimaginable.
