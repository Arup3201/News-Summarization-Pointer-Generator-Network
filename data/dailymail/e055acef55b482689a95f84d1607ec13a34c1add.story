John Lewis customers opted to shop from home at Christmas, with sales on the company’s website soaring by a fifth on 2013 figures.

Online sales at the chain rose by an impressive 19 per cent – in stark contrast to its department stores, where the figure fell.

Big sellers included Lego, coffee machines and the NutriBullet smoothie maker, which sold out.

Boost: John Lewis recorded a massive increase in sales on Black Friday in the last weekend of November

The figures from Britain’s leading retailer are indicative of a shift in shopping habits away from the High Street, where numbers were down in December.

John Lewis recorded a massive increase in sales on Black Friday in the last weekend of November, but numbers fell away in December. 

As a result, sales in the crucial week before Christmas fell for what is thought to be the first time in the history of John Lewis.

But the switch to internet shopping and the impact of Black Friday boosted sales across the group by 5.8 per cent for the five weeks to December 27, taking them up to £777million.

Sales in electricals and home technology rose by 6.8per cent. Homeware grew 2.3per cent and fashion, which includes beauty products, increased by 7.8per cent.

Lego was the big toy success of the year, driven by the popularity of the Lego movie. Sales of sets during the week of Black Friday were up some 46per cent on the year before.

In the post Christmas clearance sale, John Lewis was selling Lego Minifigures at the rate of more than 10 a minute.

Molton Brown and Crabtree & Evelyn beauty sets also sold well, along with luxury pillows, pillowcases and towels. There were also strong sales of TVs, washing machines and laptops.

A spokesman for John Lewis said: ‘Black Friday yielded an early sales peak.

‘It was the biggest week for sales in our 150-year history and was up 22 per cent on last year, with johnlewis.com experiencing a 300 per cent increase in traffic during the early hours of trading on Black Friday itself.’

The managing director at John Lewis, Andy Street, has argued that the rise of the web means retailers no longer need hundreds of high street outlets to have a national presence. 

He believes 60-70 should be enough for most chains.

The big DIY warehouses, B&Q and Homebase, have announced major store closures, while the supermarkets like Tesco and Sainsbury’s have cancelled more than 100 larger hypermarkets.

However, Mr Street insisted it would be wrong to write-off the high street, saying: ‘Our shops continue to have a critical role to play and will be a major development focus for us over the coming months.

‘To that end, we will be opening two further "At Home" shops in Horsham and Basingstoke in 2015 as well as our new regional flagship in the heart of Birmingham in September, which will set an exciting new benchmark in bricks and mortar retailing.’
