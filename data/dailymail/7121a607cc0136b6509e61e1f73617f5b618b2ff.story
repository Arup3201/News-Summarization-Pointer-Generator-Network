Thanks to Twitter enabling famous faces to wax on (and on) about the wonders of face creams, trainers and snack foods with whom they have sponsorship deals, you can't move for celebrity endorsements these days.

But some - Elizabeth Hurley for Estee Lauder, David Beckham for Armani, Cheryl Cole for L'Oreal - are rather less embarrassing than others.

Celebrities putting their names to some less glamorous products recently include presenter Carol Smillie for 'period pants', performer Dawn O'Porter for a £3m Andrex Washlets campaign and singer Katy Perry, reportedly paid £1.9m for endorsing Proactiv acne cream.

(And that's before we've even mentioned those JLS-branded Durex condoms, and Kardashian matriarch Kris Jenner's confession that she uses Poise Pads to relieve her incontinence problem.)

Smillie has just launched Diary Dolls - a pair of 'waterproof but breathable' briefs to protect young girls with irregular periods from having 'embarrassing accidents' - with friend and former professional tennis player Annabel Croft.

Describing how the £9.99 underpants work, the website blurb says: 'DiaryDoll period pants are there to be your best friend when your period is due!

'Super soft and lightweight, they feel and look exactly like ordinary pants but have a secret waterproof, breathable panel to minimize any embarrassing leaks. Great for heavy periods, overnights, sport, in fact anytime you need a little extra protection.

'DiaryDolls come in their own pretty drawstring purse to keep in your bag all the time so you're never caught short. They'll reduce that worry or humiliation, and buy you enough time to get yourself sorted. DiaryDoll, relax, she's got it covered, period.'

Meanwhile, Dawn O'Porter - who changed her name from Dawn Porter when she married actor Chris O'Dowd last year - came under fire from Janet Street-Porter after appearing on Andrex's new commercial for Washlets wet wipes.

Really? Dawn O'Porter appears on Andrex's adverts for Washlets, telling women they should be using them if they want to be really clean

In her column in the Daily Mail, Street-Porter condemned Dawn for selling women unneccessary hygeine products by making them insecure about their bodies.

She said: Dawn O'Porter, once a sassy telly presenter, is reduced to masquerading as Claudia Winkleman, driving around the country in a battle bus, exhorting the female population to start wiping their bottoms with Andrex Washlets.

'Cleanliness warrior Dawn is a traitor to feminism, no matter what she writes on her blog. While there may be justification for buying pads if you suffer from a weak pelvic floor, I'd bet 99 per cent of women have absolutely no need for these products.

'Wet toilet tissues are hardly environmentally friendly because when they're flushed down the loo they take longer to break down. One water company is spending £9 million a year on clearing blockages caused by products like this - a cost that will surely be reflected in our water bills.

'More importantly, who thinks women are so stinky we need to wipe our bottoms with WET tissues? What's wrong with loo paper? Obviously, manufacturers have to come up with new, more expensive products to flog us, and to do that, they trade on our insecurity.'

Singer Katy Perry was in a spot of bother last summer for putting her face and name - along with Justin Bieber - to a 'miracle' acne cream that was accused of presenting a 'misleading' message to British audiences.

Spot of bother: Katy Perry endorsing acne cream Proactiv, though the advert was later banned when a viewer complained the ingredients in the American product were different to those in the English one

British watchdogs banned the Proactiv
commercials in Britain since the UK version of the product - which 
boasted celebrities including Elle Macpherson, Avril Lavigne and Made In
Chelsea's Gabriella Ellis among its celebrity endorsers - does not 
contain the same active ingredient used in the American brand.

The Proactiv ads, shown on a 
teleshopping channel, showed Perry - rumoured to be paid almost $3m 
(£1.9m) for her endorsement - telling viewers the cream had helped clear
up her problem skin.

A further series of ads on the 
Proactiv website showed other stars, including Justin Bieber, giving 
their support for the product.

But a woman contacted the Advertising
Standards Authority to complain that the promotional adverts were 
misleading because the celebrities concerned were likely to have used 
Proactiv's American brand, which contains an active ingredient not 
present in the UK version. Eventually the ASA banned the ads.

In 2011, Kardashian matriarch Kris 
Jenner became the face of Poise Pads after admitting she used them to 
control her incontinence problem, and the year before boy-band JLS launched a line of Durex condoms with their faces on the packaging.
