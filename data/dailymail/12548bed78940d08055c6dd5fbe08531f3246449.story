Dodging Bullets landed a ninth Grade One 888sport Tingle Creek Chase for trainer Paul Nicholls at Sandown as Sam Twiston-Davies drove the six-year-old to a two-and-a-half-length success from Somersby.

But the race was marred by death of Nicky Henderson’s Oscar Whisky who had to be put down after breaking a hind leg when falling at the sixth fence.

The winner of 16 of his 28 races and over £500,000, Oscar Whisky had not matched the high expectations of him over fences but only because of the level he had set over hurdles where his achievements included a third to Hurricane Fly in the 2011 Champion Hurdle and two wins in the Grade One Aintree Hurdle.

Henderson had otherwise enjoyed a rewarding afternoon with three winners - Caracci Apache, Cup Final and Snake Eyes – at Sandown and Dawalan at Aintree.

But the day belonged to Nicholls, who completed a Grade One double having landed the Henry VIII Novices’ Chase with Noel Fehily-ridden Vibrato Valtat while also training Tingle Creek Chase third Hinterland.

Dodging Bullets is 14-1 for the Betway Champion Chase at Cheltenham in March.

Nicholls said: ‘He is getting stronger and better. We'll get him at his best at Cheltenham and he should be there with a chance.’

Amateur rider Sam Waley-Cohen continued his fine Aintree record with a win in the Becher Chase on Oscar Time, trained by his father Robert.

There was also a sad twist to this race, Irish runner Balbriggan fatally breaking a leg while galloping after the ninth fence.
