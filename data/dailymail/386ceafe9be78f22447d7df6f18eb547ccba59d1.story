It was definitely one small step for robotkind - the Mars Opportunity Rover drove just 12 feet on May 8 - but it's a sign that the robot is still going, eight years into a mission that was meant to last just three months.

Opportunity had spent 19 weeks stuck in one place to 'weather out' the dark months of the Martian winter on an outcrop called Greeley Haven.

This week, the solar power rose enough for it to drive again.

A view captured by Opportunity before starting its first drive of 2012. The Rover has been 'stuck' in the same place for 19 weeks, waiting for the sun to provide enough power. This week, it drove 12 feet

Opportunity has worked through four Martian southern hemisphere winters since it landed in in January 2004 about 14 miles northwest of its current location.Closer to the equator than its twin rover, Spirit, Opportunity has not needed to stay on a sun-facing slope during the previous winters.Now, however, Opportunity's solar panels carry a thicker coating of dust, and the team is using a strategy employed for three winters with Spirit: staying on a sun-facing slope.

Since landing in the Meridiani region of Mars on Jan. 25, 2004,  Opportunity has driven 21.4 miles.Opportunity and its rover twin, Spirit, completed their three-month prime missions on Mars in April 2004.

Both rovers continued for years of bonus, extended missions. Both have made important discoveries about wet environments on ancient Mars that may have been favorable for supporting microbial life. Spirit stopped communicating in 2010.

Opportunity knocks: The rover has been on Mars for nearly eight years

Water discovery: Opportunity helped confirm that Mars used to be much warmer and wetter

On average it lies 141.6 million miles from the Sun.

With a diameter of 4,222 miles, it’s around half the size of the Earth.

It’s absolutely freezing there, with an average temperature of -85F (-65C).

Gravity is much less powerful - slightly less than 40 per cent of ours.

The
atmosphere is desperately thin – one per cent of Earth’s pressure – and
not very nice for us humans because 95 per cent of it is carbon 
dioxide.

It boasts the solar
system’s biggest mountain – Olympus Mons, a dead volcano with 
staggering proportions. It measures 335 miles across and rises to a 
height of 88,000ft, which is almost three times higher than Everest.

Mars has two cosmic sidekicks – the moons Deimos and Phobos.

Mars’s red colouring comes from the iron oxide that coats its surface.

Mars
has huge amounts of ice at its polar caps. If they melted, it would 
cover the whole planet in water 11-metres deep, according to Nasa.

Among its chores is studying bedrock 
and soil at its chosen winter site. While Opportunity can drive short 
distances from one outcrop to another, it cannot venture far in the 
cold.

It is a
bittersweet juncture for Opportunity, which along with its twin, 
Spirit, landed on opposite sides of the red planet in January 2004.

Spirit
suddenly stopped communicating with Earth last year, shortly after it 
became stuck in fluffy sand. Nasa diligently listened for any sign from 
Spirit and finally gave up this past spring.

Despite
Spirit's demise, Opportunity continued to trek across the Martian 
plains and arrived at the western rim of Endeavour Crater in August.

The
rover has wowed scientists with discoveries at the site, which includes
rocks and soil unlike any it has encountered during its years roaming 
the planet.

Opportunity recently uncovered a mineral deposit that formed from water flowing out of volcanic rocks.

Chief
scientist Steve Squyres of Cornell University called it the ‘single 
most powerful piece of evidence’ that Opportunity has found so far of 
liquid water existing on Mars long ago.

The finding was presented at a meeting of the American Geophysical Union in San Francisco.

With
a little over 21 miles on the clock, Opportunity is showing some wear, 
including an arthritic shoulder, but is otherwise in good health.

‘It's
going on eight years, but we're not done yet,’ said Ray Arvidson, the 
mission deputy scientist from Washington University in St Louis.

Happy landing: This image shows where the rover's airbags left impressions in the martian soil. The drag marks were made after were retracted

That is eight years as measured in Earth time. A Martian year is equivalent to 687 Earth days, or nearly two Earth years.

Opportunity
will soon get some company on the surface. Nasa launched its latest 
spacecraft to Mars last month, a mega-rover named Curiosity that's set 
to land next summer.

The 
£1.6billion mission will study a mountain inside a crater to determine 
whether the environment was conducive for microbial life.
