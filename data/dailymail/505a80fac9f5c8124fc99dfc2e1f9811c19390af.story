Oregon State Police say a 19-year-old man has caused a three-car crash when he fainted while holding his breath as he drove through a tunnel northwest of Portland.

According to a news release, Daniel J. Calhon, of Snohomish, Washington, told investigators he fainted Sunday afternoon while holding his breath in the Highway 26 tunnel near the community of Manning.

His car, a 1990 Toyota Camry, drifted across the centerline and crashed head-on with a Ford Explorer. Some people hold their breaths in tunnels as part of a game or superstition.

The driver was holding his breath in keeping with a popular superstition about not breathing in tunnels

Fallout: The driver who crashed into the other cars and his passenger are being treated for non-life-threatening injuries

Both vehicles struck the tunnel walls before a pickup hit the Camry.

Four people, including Calhon and his passenger, 19-year-old Bradley Meyring, of Edmonds, Washington, suffered non-life-threatening injuries.

Police say Calhon has been cited for reckless driving, three counts of reckless endangerment and fourth-degree assault.
