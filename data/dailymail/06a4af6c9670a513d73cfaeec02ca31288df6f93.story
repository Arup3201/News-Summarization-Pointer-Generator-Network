Council chiefs have issued a 13 point checklist telling children how to play outside, it emerged yesterday.

The ‘outdoor play code’ included instructions such as ‘don’t climb over walls’, ‘try not to shout’ and ‘don’t play in one place for a long time’.

Children were also warned to keep their play area tidy, that playing on the roads could be illegal and to ask neighbours before going into their gardens to retrieve balls.

A council has decided today's children need a 13-point checklist telling them how to play outside

The briefing was posted through the doors of families in North Tyneside, Newcastle, after a resident complained about several incidents of groups of children playing ball games on a number of local roads.

A child kicking a ball into a resident’s garden and damaging their plants is also believed to have triggered action from the council.

Within days, everyone in the area received a letter from the council to say children’s play would be monitored and residents should read the ‘outdoor play code’.

Last night local residents were furious about the letter and branded the move ‘ridiculous’.

A father-of-two, who lives on one of the roads affected, said: ‘I was very surprised to get a letter.

‘There was an incident a few weeks ago, a ball had gone into a man’s garden and some of his flowers were squashed. It was all tittle-tattle and then we receive this letter through the door.

‘The play code is quite condescending. The council have not given any evidence of how many complaints have been made and to what extent the damage is, if any.

Mother-of-two Sally Farn, 55, said she was furious over the council’s letter.

Mrs Farn, whose two grandchildren, Abi Lee, nine, and her seven-year-old brother Steven, live with her in one of the roads, said: ‘I think this is absolutely ridiculous. They aren’t allowed to play in the street but there is nothing else for them to do around here.

‘I don’t like my kids to play away from the door. I like to be able to see them so I can keep an eye on them.

‘This is a stupid set of rules. The people who created them obviously don’t have kids or theirs have grown up.

‘They should back off and let the kids play.’

Newcastle MP Chi Onwurah warned at the time that children should not be made to feel like criminals for playing in the outdoors.

A spokesperson for North Tyneside Council said: ‘As a council we want all of North Tyneside’s children and young people to enjoy playing safely outdoors, especially in the long summer evenings.

We have a great range of leisure activities and some brilliant parks and play sites.

‘But we also have a role to play in making sure neighbours get along together.

‘Over the years, particularly in summer, we get complaints about a tiny minority of young people upsetting some residents. In order to be fair to everyone, we have a ‘Play Code’ which we simply drop off in an area where there have been complaints.

‘This allows everyone to understand what is reasonable.’
