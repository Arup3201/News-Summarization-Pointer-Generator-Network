The botched execution of an Oklahoma inmate that lasted almost 45 minutes was caused by the intravenous line in his groin that swelled to the size of golf ball, according to a state review released on Thursday.

Agony: Clayton Lockett's execution was poorly managed according to an Oklahoma state official review

The line into Clayton Lockett was not properly monitored during his April 29 execution and caused him to writhe and groan in agony and led to Governor Mary Fallin halting all upcoming lethal injections in the state until the completion of the review.

The review, released by the Oklahoma Department of Public Safety, cited the problems with Lockett's IV line and also recommended more training for prison officials and medical personnel involved in executions.

Department of Corrections Director Robert Patton had previously said inmate Clayton Lockett died from a heart attack several minutes after he ordered the execution stopped.

But the autopsy report performed for the Oklahoma Department of Public Safety said all three execution drugs were found throughout Lockett's system.

A medical examiner declared that the cause of death was 'judicial execution by lethal injection.' 

The investigation concluded the viability of the IV access point was the single greatest factor that contributed to the difficulty in administering the execution drugs,' according to the DPS report. The agency's commissioner was appointed by Fallin.

Oklahoma put executions on hold after Lockett gasped and writhed against his restraints for several minutes after his April execution began.

Lockett was poked several times as medical technicians tried to find a vein before settling in using one at his groin.

Gov. Mary Fallin had no immediate comment on the report, nor did a corrections department spokesman.

Oklahoma used the sedative midazolam for the first time in Lockett's execution. That drug was also used in lengthy attempts to execute an Ohio inmate in January and an Arizona prisoner last month. 

Each time, witnesses said the inmates appeared to gasp after their executions began and continued to labor for air before being pronounced dead.

But Oklahoma's review didn't find fault with midazolam or other drugs, instead noting that the IV troubles made it difficult to determine the drugs' effectiveness.

A paramedic and physician inserted the intravenous line in Lockett's groin after failing to find suitable veins in his arms, legs, neck and feet. 

The report says the IV site was covered with a sheet and not monitored until Lockett began moving unexpectedly after receiving two doses of drugs.

'The physician observed an area of swelling underneath the skin and described it as smaller than a tennis ball, but larger than a golf ball. 

The physician believed the swelling would have been noticeable if the access point had been viewed during the process,' the report said.

State prisons director Robert Patton halted Lockett's execution, and Lockett died behind a shuttered curtain 43 minutes after his execution began.

Patton said the cause was a heart attack, but autopsy results released last week said he died from the drugs: midazolam, vercuronium bromide and potassium chloride. The autopsy did not explain why the execution took so long or why Lockett writhed.

Lockett's execution was to be the first of two executions held back-to-back on April 29, but the second execution was postponed that night.

The DPS report recommended that the state hold executions at least seven days apart, noting that the prison warden believed that the planned double execution caused 'extra stress' for staff members.

Lockett, 38, had been convicted of shooting Stephanie Nieman, 19, with a sawed-off shotgun and watching as two accomplices buried her alive in 1999.

Three executions have been set in Oklahoma for November and December. One of the inmates is Charles Warner, who was supposed to die the same day as Lockett.
