Bode Miller crashed out of the men's super-G at the world championships on Thursday.

The 37-year-old American skier suffered a deep cut on his right calf after he hit his left arm on a gate, spun backward and lost both skis in a crash  at the world championships. 

The U.S. Ski Team said he was being evaluated by the medical staff for the cut just above his boot line.

 Miller was competing in his first race since back surgery in November and had a fast run going. He was charging in his fashion and had the lead midway through the course. But he cut a gate too close and hooked his arm, sending him spiraling out of control.

First, one ski popped off. Then the other and he began to somersault down the slope. Once he righted himself, he slid for a bit on his bottom.

The six-time Olympic medalist slowly got up and waited for someone to bring his skis. He then clicked back in and wrapped up the run, albeit missing one of his ski poles. He waved to the crowd after crossing the finish line.

His wife, professional volleyball player Morgan Miller, was in the stands when the accident happened.

This is a course Miller knows well. He's won four times on the tricky Birds of Prey course, but never in the super-G.

Miller wasn't the only skier to get caught up in a gate. Favorite Kjetil Jansrud of Norway crashed through one with his left shoulder, but kept going. He was rubbing his shoulder after he completed his run. It cost him valuable time and a chance at a gold medal.

Aksel Lund Svindal of Norway also was making his first start of the season after surgery on his torn Achilles tendon in October. He turned in a fast run and after finishing he fell to the snow in jubilation.
