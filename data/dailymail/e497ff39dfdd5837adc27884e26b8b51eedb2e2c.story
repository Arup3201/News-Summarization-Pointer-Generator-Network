A tiger hunt is underway near Paris today following reports of a wild beast roaming around a supermarket car park.

Police marksmen supported by a helicopter were scrambled after residents said they saw the animal in France’s Seine-et-Marne department, to the east of the capital.

French authorities told residents to remain indoors as emergency services search for the tiger in an area approximately five miles from the Disneyland Paris theme park.

‘The alleged tiger is being tracked, but we are trying to intercept it,’ a local police spokesman said. 

He added that special officers trained in using tranquilizers were involved, and that the aim was to capture the beast alive.

One wildlife expert said: ‘We’re going to try and sedate it, but if it becomes dangerous or aggressive, we’ll give the order to kill it.’

Meanwhile a local council spokesman in Montevrain said: 'We urge caution and please do not walk around the area behind the tennis courts and football pitches, which have been cordoned off since this morning.

‘We will keep you updated of all events. We repeat - do not walk around, and take your car instead'.

It was first spotted near the village of Montevrain, where a grainy picture of a cat-like animal was taken.

Police say the aim of the search operation is to capture the tiger alive, with officers used in the hunt specialised in using tranquillizers

Jean-Baptiste Berdeaux, who manages the Intermarche supermarket told reporters: ‘My wife saw it this morning. She didn't get out of the car and called me to say “I think I saw a lynx”.’

There was a circus in the village earlier this month, but all its animals, including tigers, are now accounted for.

‘There is no question of a tiger having escaped from this circus, which was very well regulated,’ said a town council spokesman.

A spokesman for EuroDisney said the animal was nothing to do with them, as they do not keep live tigers.

Others have pointed out the Parc des Félins big cat park in Lumigny Nesle-Ormeaux – 18 miles away from Montévrain – as a more likely source.

The tiger is the largest species of cat and – beyond zoos and circuses – there are no known communities in Europe.
