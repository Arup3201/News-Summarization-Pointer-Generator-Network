A village was rocked by an exploding Second World War shell today after it was dug up by an unsuspecting gardener.

The live mortar shell was discovered by an unnamed woman as she tended to plants in her back garden in Kidlington, Oxfordshire, this afternoon.

Police and an Army bomb disposal team arrived at the scene shortly before 3pm to deal with the unexploded device.

However, as the shell was still live, they were forced to carry out a 'controlled explosion' in the village, which is situated between the River Cherwell and the Oxford Canal.

Officers from Thames Valley Police took to social media to warn locals that the detonation would likely be heard for miles around.

In a Facebook post, they said: 'It is likely that the explosion will be heard and the aftershock felt in the surrounding area.

'Local residents should be reassured that this is a controlled explosion and there will be no disruption to the public.

'There will be an increased police presence in the village to reassure members of the public.'

A police ordnance team took the shell to a safe location, before it was detonated by bomb disposal officers from RAF Northolt.

The explosion caused a massive bang and even rattled the windows of homes in the area, according to reports.
