Well turned out: Rebekah Brooks wore a navy pencil skirt suit with a green scarf and black Christian Louboutin heels as she arrived at Westminster Magistrates Court

She click-clacked into court with her husband at her side before her four-inch heels fell silent on the drab carpet tiles.

The shoes were by Christian Louboutin. The charges were by the Crown Prosecution Service.

Rebekah Brooks, formerly one of the most powerful women in Rupert Murdoch’s empire, took a place in the dock yesterday to face allegations that she conspired to pervert the course of justice in the phone hacking scandal.

Across London in another court, millions of pounds worth of lawyers ground solemnly through another day of the Leveson Inquiry, at which Deputy Prime Minister Nick Clegg gave evidence.

Here in the majesty of Westminster Magistrates’ court, day one of Regina versus Mrs Brooks and others was more like a film premiere.

True, they didn’t roll out the red carpet for the 44-year-old former tabloid editor when the first glimpse of those red-sole shoes and nude fishnet tights emerged from the door of a taxi.

But the flame-haired ex-News International chief executive was certainly the star of the several-yard walk through a corridor of TV crews and photographers calling her name.

Non-celebrity defendants stood silently on the pavement as husband Charlie Brooks, an Old Etonian friend of David Cameron, was whisked past the masses.

Upstairs, two QCs and a couple of high-profile solicitors were already in Court One to represent Mr and Mrs Brooks and the four other defendants appearing with them.

‘What a star-studded cast,’ remarked district judge Howard Riddle as the eminent lawyers’ names were disclosed.

Back in the old days, in the court this new building replaced, the case list included the likes of John Lennon and Yoko Ono, Mick Jagger and Marianne Faithfull.

Yesterday Mrs Brooks’s name featured alongside Latvian and Polish extradition cases. The hearing might have lasted only eight minutes, but it still provided an element of legal theatre.

Tourists stopped to take photographs and at least two entered the public gallery for Act One of what is likely to be a lengthy legal battle. The Crown regards this simply as due process. Mrs Brooks and her husband have famously branded it a ‘witch hunt’.

‘All stand’, said a voice from the Bench, and six defendants sprang up from their seats. They folded their hands in front of them in the manner of schoolchildren appearing before the headmaster.

Say cheese! Mr and Mrs Brooks appeared relaxed as they left the court, smiling for photographers

Rebekah Brooks wore a navy pencil skirt suit cut above the knee for the hearing at Southwark Crown Court today.

The 44-year-old accessorised with a £200 Alexander McQueen skull-print olive green scarf that oozed defiance and set off her flame-red hair to great effect.

The outfit reflected the confidence in her smile, and she wore a low-cut camisole under her tailored jacket.

She finished off the designer look with black Christian Louboutin court shoes, underlining her sense of style as well as her wealth from a stellar career at News International.

Mrs Brooks wore a navy suit with a pencil skirt. She adjusted her green silk scarf and clutched a hefty handbag.

Mr Brooks, a 49-year-old racehorse 
trainer, snatched a glance at his wife before they were all asked for 
their names, dates of birth and addresses. The Brooks’ address in 
Churchill, Oxfordshire, was given in full detail.

Alongside them stood members of Mrs 
Brooks’ former entourage – personal assistant Cheryl Carter, 48, from 
Chelmsford, Essex; chauffeur Paul Edwards, 47, of Bethnal Green, east 
London; security consultant Daryl Jorsling, 39, from Aldershot, 
Hampshire and News International security chief Mark Hanna, 49, from 
Buckingham.

Mrs Brooks faces three charges of 
conspiring to pervert the course of justice, the maximum sentence for 
which is life imprisonment.

She is accused of removing boxes of 
material from the News International archive and allegedly trying to 
conceal documents, computers and other items from Operation Weeting, 
Scotland Yard’s inquiry into phone hacking. Her husband and the four 
other defendants all face a single charge of conspiring to pervert the 
course of justice.

None of the charges was formally put 
to the defendants, no pleas were entered, and bail was continued. 
Conditions read to the court by prosecuting lawyer Nigel Pilkington 
included foreign travel restrictions and a ban on certain defendants 
contacting each other. The case was sent for trial at Southwark Crown 
Court on June 22.

Outside, more tourists had joined the photographers. 
Mrs Brooks, who became editor of the News of the World aged 31 and the 
first woman to edit The Sun three years later, emerged smiling, husband 
alongside with his hands in his pockets.

She swung round on her heels 
and laughed at one stage. A Nicole Kidman moment was how one snapper 
described it.

In a few seconds, the red hair and 
red-sole shoes disappeared into a waiting black cab. ‘Who was that?’ 
another cab driver asked. ‘My ex-boss,’ the photographer replied.

Sorry we are unable to accept comments for legal reasons.
