Hacktivist group Anonymous has claimed to take down more than 1,000 ISIS sites, accounts and emails since launching an offensive against the militant group in the wake of the Charlie Hebdo massacre.

The group released a video boasting of the online accounts it has 'exposed and destroyed' since declaring war against jihadists in January.

In this latest video a red outline of the group's masked front man warns 'there is no safe place for [ISIS] online'.

Hacktivist group Anonymous has claimed to have successfully targeted more than a thousand ISIS-related Twitter accounts, Facebook pages and websites

'Remember, the terrorists that are calling themselves Islamic State (ISIS) are not Muslims,' says the animated drawing, wearing the distinctive Guy Fawkes mask.

'ISIS: we will hunt you, take down your sites, accounts, emails, and expose you...

'From now on, no safe place for you online.

'You will be treated like a virus, And we are the cure.'

The group was also keen to stress they 'come from all races, countries, religions and ethnicity', saying they are 'rich, poor, young,or old, gay or straight'.

A list released by the group shows hundreds of Twitter accounts used by ISIS or ISIS-affiliated groups which have been targeted.

Some have been taken down entirely, while others  have been hacked, with tweets added in.

They have also revealed email addresses and 12 Facebook accounts they say have been keeping in touch with 'terrorists' - encouraging people to monitor the latter. 

Some of the accounts have been taken down, while some other ones - like the 12 email accounts - have simply been exposed

Anonymous decided to declare war after the Paris shootings, using the hashtag #OpISIS

In a statement they explained: 'Freedom of expression has suffered inhuman assault ... It is our duty to react ... We wish to express our condolences to the families of the victims of this cowardly and despicable act.'

They added: 'We will fight always and everywhere the enemies of freedom of expression ... Freedom of expression and opinion is a non-negotiable thing. To tackle it is to attack democracy.

'Expect a massive frontal reaction from us because the struggle for the defense of those freedoms is the foundation of our movement.' 

It closed down its first extremist website by January 12. 

Hacker group Anonymous has been linked to online attacks around the world

Hacker group Anonymous  has been linked to online attacks around the world aimed at punishing governments for policies of which the hackers disapprove.

Members are known as 'Anons' and are distinguished by their Guy Fawkes masks.

The group are seen as anything from digital Robin Hoods to cyber terrorists for their hacking campaigns against government agencies, child pornography sites and the Klu Klux Klan. 

In 2008 the online community staged a series of protests, pranks, and hacks Church of Scientology as part if its 'Project Chanology.'

Later targets of Anonymous 'hacktivism' included government agencies of the US, Israel, Tunisia, Uganda, and others, copyright protection agencies; the Westboro Baptist Church; and corporations such as PayPal, MasterCard, Visa, and Sony. 

In 2013 they declared war on secretive 'chat sites' used by paedophiles to trade images.

Last November they hacked into the Twitter account of the Ku Klux Klan after the white supremacist group distributed flyers threatening 'lethal force'  protesters in Ferguson.

Dozens of people have been arrested for involvement in Anonymous cyberattacks, in countries including the US, UK, Australia, the Netherlands, Spain, and Turkey.
