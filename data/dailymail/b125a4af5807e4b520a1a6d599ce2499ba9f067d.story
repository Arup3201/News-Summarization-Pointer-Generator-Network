The official merchandise shop for Kensington Palace has been accused of acting in ‘bad taste’ for selling a scarf featuring images of Princess Diana.

The silk scarf is being sold for £85 by independent charity The Historic Royal Palaces.

But Rosa Monckton, who was a close friend of Diana, said: ‘I think that this is in very bad taste.

'Bad taste': This scarf sold by the official merchandise shop for Kensington Palace has caused controversy as Diana's friends claim that it is a commercial ploy

‘The Diana Memorial Fund spent 
millions of pounds in lawyers’ fees in trying to protect her image, 
specifically against an American company producing a Diana doll.’

Ms Monkton, 59, who chose Diana to 
be godmother to her daughter Domenica, added: ‘If the Diana Memorial 
Fund still existed, would it now be suing the Royal Palaces? 

'This is clearly a cynical, commercial exercise.’

The scarf was designed by renowned fashion illustrator Julie Verhoeven, who has previously worked with top fashion houses.

Nearly all the drawings on the pattern are from unofficial photographs of Diana.

A spokesman for Princes William and Harry declined to comment about the scarf, but it is understood that Royal aides are not pleased by the decision to sell it.

Meanwhile, Harry’s new flame Cressida Bonas, 24, was one of 200 people who clicked ‘attending’ on a Facebook group page set up to arrange a leaving party for the Prince’s ex-girlfriend Chelsy Davy.

Chelsy is moving to Istanbul next week.
