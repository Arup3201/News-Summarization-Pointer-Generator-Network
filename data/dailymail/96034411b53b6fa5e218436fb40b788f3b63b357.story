Santa Claus did not come to town, or at least he did not make his traditional appearance at one elementary school's winter concert, after he was banned following a complaint.

Many parents were outraged after receiving a letter notifying them of the change from the principal of the Andrew Peabody School in Cambridge, Massachusetts, days before the December 12 event.

'Our First through Fourth grade concert as well as our Kindergarten concert will not include a visit from Santa Claus this year,' wrote Jennifer Ford.

Bah Humbug: Santa Claus was banned from attending the winter concert at the Andrew Peabody School in Cambridge, Massachusetts after a complaint. Parents were outraged after they were notified of the decision in a letter from school principal Jennifer Ford. Many said they did not view Santa as a religious figure

Holding up the letter which informed parents that Santa would not be attending the winter concert is WBZ reporter Katie Brace. The superintendent of the city's schools, Jeffrey Young, defended the decision

Children whose parents did not want them to attend the event which featured songs and performances, could play games and read books with her in the library, she added. 

Robert Thompson, who has two children at the school, questioned the decision to break with tradition, which he claimed was made after a single complaint.

'I don't think it's right, and I know a lot of people agree with me,' He told the WBZ TV station. 'It seems like that's what's going on in America – the squeaky wheel gets oil. It's a shame.' 

He added that would not be offended if other cultures were added to the concert.  

Another, Mohammed Hassan said that the school shouldn't view him as a religious figure. 

'It's fun for kids, which is good,' he said. 

However, the superintendent of the city's schools defended the decision, although he admitted to The Boston Globe newspaper that he had been unaware of Santa's absence. 

'Our mission is around education. Santa's not on the top of my list,' said Jeffrey Young, noting that Santa's weren't hard to find at this time of year. 

'I just don't know why he has to be in the school,' he added.

While principal Ford has yet to comment on Santa's absence, her letter did say Santa would make an appearance at a family sing son on December 23, which parents can opt their children out of.  

Santa will be making an appearance at the school's Christmas concert on November 23
