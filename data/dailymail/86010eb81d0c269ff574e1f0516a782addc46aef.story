You can’t have a good showbiz tale without at least one tear-jerker of a comeback in which the hero, after suffering ridicule and criticism, triumphantly returns to wipe the floor with the opposition.

And that’s exactly what gymnast Louis Smith did on Saturday’s Strictly when he did a Charleston that was hailed as the best dance of the night.

Having been accused of lacking personality, producers unpacked and dusted down the ‘acting coach’ that they like to wheel out every series to inject a dose of luvviness into a chosen celebrity’s performance.

Rapturous applause: The audience got a bit carried away after seeing Louis's Charleston

By the time the coach had finished 
with little Louis he could pull faces and do jazz hands with the best of
them. He gurned his way through the Charleston like Lionel Blair on 
acid, even throwing in a moonwalk and a somersault for good measure.

Following
the disappointment of his Paso Doble the previous week and his 
subsequent savaging by the nasty, mean judges, it brought the house 
down. Almost literally.

The
studio audience – largely made up of middle-aged housewives – got a bit
carried away, not only giving him the obligatory standing ovation but 
also whooping and noisily stamping their feet in appreciation. They’ll 
all be rioting in their cul-de-sacs if Louis isn’t in the final in three
weeks’ time.

Always a professional: Denise drew on her stage experience and carried on with her routine despite partner James forgetting part of the routine

His sterling efforts earned him a 37  from the judges, including 10s from Darcey and Bruno.

With
Louis stealing the show, Denise Van Outen lost her place at the top of 
the leaderboard thanks to an uncharacteristically messy salsa.

Stealing more than a few of Fern 
Britton’s skirt-flapping, Cockney knees-up moves, Denise’s dance was 
nowhere near the standard we’ve come to expect from her.

Matters
weren’t helped by her dance partner James Jordan forgetting his routine
halfway through, standing on the dancefloor rather like a lemon waiting
for the number 14 bus to  come along.

It’s
understandable when the celebrities forget what they’re doing but hard 
to summon up much sympathy for a trained professional.

Pulling all the stops out: Even though Michael Vaughn was determined not the end up in the dance-off, he was voted off

Despite all this, Craig Revel Horwood still saw fit to award Denise and James’s performance an eight out of ten – the same score he gave Louis’s totally flawless Charleston.

He wasn’t the only judge behaving strangely on Saturday. Bruno Tonioli, an excitable chap at the best of times, seemed to have really overindulged on the orange Smarties. Not only did he actually fall off his chair, he gave viewers more innuendo and double entendres than a Carry On film boxset.

While the male judges may be misbehaving, Darcey Bussell is becoming more delightful with each passing week.

I love her constructive criticisms, quirky tips and easy banter with the panel. I think she’s been a breath of fresh air for Strictly.

After getting great scores for his Charleston last week, Nicky Byrne was hoping to build on that success with his Argentine Tango performed to Adele’s Skyfall.

Is it my imagination or have Bond themes become almost compulsory for Strictly tangos?

Unfortunately, rather than capturing the passion and drama of the dance, Nicky looked more like he was paying his own one-man tribute to Monty Python’s Ministry of Silly Walks as his legs flailed around uncontrollably. I can only assume that after a decade of sitting on a stool as part of Westlife, he has a lot of leg-using time to make up for. It was no surprise when Nicky ended up in the dance-off.

It was also no surprise that he was joined there by Michael Vaughan, following the cricketer’s uniquely arthritic interpretation of the samba.

‘I am going to do everything I can to make sure I don’t end up in the dance-off,’ said Michael before performing.

And, you’ve got to hand it to him, he pulled all the stops out. He unbuttoned his shirt, slapped on the fake tan and had his dance partner Natalie stand in front of him throughout.

However, none of this could hide the fact that his Latin dances are always a clunky, funk-free zone.

Even though Michael was voted off last night, he was a great competitor who’ll be fondly remembered for his brilliant American Smooth at Wembley – if not for his ‘dad-dancing’ samba...

Now watch Louis Smith's Charleston...
