There isn’t a single country in the world where a woman can earn as much as a man for doing the same job and it is likely to be another 81 years before that gender gap closes, according to a new report by the World Economic Forum.

In the U.S., the wage gap between men and women closed by just one percent in the past year to 66 percent - ‘meaning that women earn about two-thirds of what men earn for similar work according to the perception of business leaders,’ said WEF economist and report author Saadia Zahidi.

America did however move up three places to 20th on the overall annual gender equality list which also looked at health, education and political participation in 142 countries.

Iceland topped the list for the sixth year running, while Yemen finished last.

The Nordic states all topped the list, with Finland, Norway and Sweden following Iceland in the top five.

Rwanda came into the rankings for the first time and took seventh place, making it the highest-ranking African economy.

The U.S. inched up three places to 20 thanks to wage gaps having narrowed and the percentage of women in political and ministerial-level positions improving.

Zahidi said Rwanda's success was because there are almost as many women as men at work - and in the country's ministerial offices - rather than because of improved access to health and education services.

Nicaragua rose to become the sixth-best place for women (up from 10 last year). The Philippines remained the highest-ranking Asian state, but fell from fifth to ninth place.

The outcomes of these scores are influenced by social forces.

Globally, much of the progress on gender equality has come from more women entering politics and the workforce, she said Zahidi.

The U.S. ranked 20th overall, going as high as 4th for economic opportunity but as low as 62nd for health and survival
