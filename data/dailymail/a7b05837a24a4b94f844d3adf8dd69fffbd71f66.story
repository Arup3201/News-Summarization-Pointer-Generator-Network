Paul Simon's wife has spoken out about the domestic dispute that resulted in the couple appearing before a Norwalk, Connecticut, judge on Monday on charges of disorderly conduct.

Folk singer Edie Brickell, who has been married to Simon for 22 years, confessed that she had started the fight and that any rift was now healed.

‘I got my feelings hurt and I picked a fight with my husband. The police called it disorderly. Thank God it's orderly now,’  she told PEOPLE in a statement.

Simon, 72, and Brickell, 48, were 
charged in New Canaan, Connecticut on Saturday night around 8.20pm at a 
cottage on their estate.

The
 couple's lawyer told MailOnline the fight involved only 'a slight push'
 and said that Brickell had told him that it was only the fourth fight 
the couple have had in their 22-year marriage.  

The
 couple arrived at the Norwalk court on Monday, smiling and holding 
hands, before sitting next to each other for the arraignment.

Simon said the dispute with wife was 
'atypical', adding: 'Neither of us have any fear.'

Ms Brickell, who is significantly taller than her husband, told the judge: 'He's no threat to me at all.'

Sources told the New York Post that the couple have been 'under stress' because of their busy work schedule.

Edie is rehearsing the Broadway musical Bright Star with Steve Martin and Paul recently returned from a tour with Sting.

The musicians said they planned to watch their son's baseball game afterwards.

The couple were represented in court by leading entertainment and property lawyer, Allan Cramer, whose clients also include Rolling Stone Keith Richards.

He told MailOnline that police initially received a call from a man, believed to have been Simon, who hung up. Cramer said Brickell's mother, who was visiting the couple, then called the police.

'Edie and Paul had gone to a cottage on the property where one of the kids lives and he wasn't there,' the lawyer said.

The dispute took place in a cottage in the grounds and was partly witnessed by Brickell's mother, Mr Cramer elaborated. None of the children were present.

Mr Cramer said: 'They love each other. On a scale of one to ten, this was a one, it was nothing. They had an argument over a couple of minor things, very minor, the kind of things that husbands and wives argue over. '

Asked if either partner was violent, Mr Cramer said the fight involved 'a slight push'. 

'The row escalated', Mr Cramer told MailOnline because: 'Edie Brickell is from Texas. She likes to have things direct. Paul is from Queens. She wanted to talk it out. Paul didn't want to have a discussion and he tried to leave (the cottage) and Edie blocked the door.'

Asked if Simon then pushed his wife, he said: 'I don't think he started the shoving. I believe the mother was there and made a call.

'Paul wanted to leave and Edie didn't want him to leave. She wanted to talk. He didn't want to talk. He wanted to exit. She was blocking the door. '

The couple appeared in court together today where they said they had 'no fear' of each other and later planned to attend their son's baseball game

Mr Cramer said that after police served each of them with a summons, Simon agreed to leave the estate for the night.

'They called me early morning to ask me to help,' added the lawyer, who said he is a family friend.

The couple have agreed to meet a psychologist whom the judge has appointed as a mediator.

She will report back to the court on May 16. Under this arrangement, 
neither of them will have to plead to the disorderly conduct charges.

The
 pair reportedly declined an invitation to leave the modern courthouse 
through a back entrance and walked out of the front doors, where a black
 chauffeured SUV picked them up.

'Edie
 and I are fine,' Paul said, as camera crews shouted questions. They 
planned to have lunch together, he said, before they drove off sitting 
side by side.

Mr Cramer told MailOnline that they plan to spend tonight under the same roof. He added that they regretted involving police.

The attorney said: 'They did not understand that under Connecticut law, the police had to take action. They thought they'd just come by and calm things.

'Edie said to me, "We've been married 22 years and we've only had four arguments." They're lovely people. The marriage is fine.'

The legendary musician married his third wife Edie in 1992. They have three children together, Adrian, Lulu, and Gabriel.

Simon's daughter re-tweeted a message on Twitter today which read: 'My 
favorite thing of all time is exaggeration.' Today is also their son 
Gabriel's 16th birthday.
