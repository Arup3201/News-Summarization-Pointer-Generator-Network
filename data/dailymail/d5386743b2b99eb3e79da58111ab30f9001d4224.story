Michael Owen praised Manchester United's array of attacking talent but suggested that Louis van Gaal was only concentrating on short-term results. 

The former Liverpool and Real Madrid striker, who spent three years at United, claimed the club should invest in more youthful attacking options.

'It's an exceptional attacking unit. The only negative thing you would say is that all of the strikers are of a certain age,' Owen told Manchester Evening News.

Robin van Persie, at 31 years of age, is unlikely to play at the highest level for more than a few more years

Michael Owen, who joined Manchester United in 2009, believes they need to invest in more young strikers

'In the coming years you would expect United to invest or produce another good youngster to take on that baton in the future.'

Club captain Wayne Rooney is 29 years old, new signing Radamel Falcao is 28 while Robin van Persie is now 31.

Owen was insistent, though, that Van Gaal's side will be well catered for in the immediate future. 

He said: 'The here and now is very exciting and the here and now for the next few years is very exciting. 

'(Robin) Van Persie is getting a little bit older so he has two or three years at the top still. You would say in the next two or three years Louis van Gaal would be wanting to win something.'

Club captain Wayne Rooney is now 29 years old, making him the club's second youngest first-team striker

Radamel Falcao joined the club this summer but is already 28 and with a history of injury problems
