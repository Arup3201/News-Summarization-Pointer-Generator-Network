A gang of thieves spent five hours tunneling through a wall of a corner shop to steal £7,000 worth of cash, alcohol and cigarettes - and some ice creams.

Adhir Das's store in Highgate, north London, was raided by thieves on Sunday. They drilled through the wall from an empty property next door and into the basement of the Highgate Plus Grocery.

They then made their way upstairs in to the shop before spraying shaving foam over the CCTV camera.

A gang of thieves drilled this hole in the wall of a Highgate shop in order to steal £7,000 worth of goods from the store. Having gaining access, they climbed the stairs of the shop to take cigarettes, alcohol and cash

The gang took £3,000 from the till and around £4,000 worth of alcohol and cigarettes.

It would appear the gang also took some ice creams - as the shop owner discovered numerous Magnum wrappers on the floor.

Mr Das, 52, received two alarm calls during the night but after finding nothing suspicious, returned home.

The shopkeeper discovered the hole in the basement after arriving at work the next morning. He then noticed some shaving foam on the counter and the ice cream wrappers.

It is thought the raid could have been inspired by thieves in Salford who tunneled 50ft beneath a supermarket to steal £86,000 from a cash point earlier this week.

The owner found a shaving foam cap on one of the shelves, left, and the counter was ransacked by the thieves. The thieves took around £4,000 worth of alcohol and cigarettes

He said: 'They made a hole in the wall on Sunday, but we thought the noise was just some builders next door.

'I went downstairs into the basement in the morning and found a big hole in the corner. I couldn't believe it. It's like a bank heist or something.

'If I had gone downstairs during the night I'm sure the people would have been there. It's scary.'

'They stole cigarettes, alcohol, everything. I'm facing a terrible bill- around £1,500 worth of damage.

Thieves tunneled under a Tesco supermarket in Salford earlier in the week to steal thousands from an ATM

'I don't think the police will catch them. Small businesses never ever get help from them.

'If it happened in Tesco's or Sainsbury's the police would have been there in five minutes.'

He added: 'There's no way of claiming it back on insurance. I'm considering closing my business.

'What should I do? If I pay for it myself my business loses so much money.

'Running a business with costs like these is just so hard. I won't be able to afford to keep it going much longer if this happens again.'

Shop owner Adhir Das is now fighting to save his business after the robbery

He added: 'We had an incident a few months ago when a bus full of football fans who'd come from Wembley were taking beer and chocolate from the store.

'It wasn't shoplifting, it was looting. And no one could do anything.

'I reported it to the police and showed them CCTV footage and the registration of the bus but they didn't do anything.'

A Scotland Yard spokesman said police are investigating but no arrests have been made.
