One of rugby's greatest larrkins, Nick Cummins, has made headlines again - not just for his football skills but also his entertaining lingo that has gained him an army of adoring fans.

Nicknamed Honey Badger, the former Wallabies cult hero, was interviewed after the Barbarians’ 40-36 loss to Australia at Twickenham Oval in London and delivered his well-loved fair dinkum Aussie style.

His impressive performance with the Barbarians, that brings together players from all over the world in the annual entertainment match, has put the spotlight on attempting to bring the winger back home from his recent move to the Coca Cola West Red Sparks in Japan's top league.

The Badger did not disappoint when being interviewed by a British reporter, Fox Rugby reported. 

'It was back and forth it was up and down it was bloody everywhere and mate it was just ah bloody enjoyable rugby mate,' he started off saying to describe the match.

'I was on Animal Planet one night and this thing has come up. It's an absolute machine, it has no natural predators and is the size of a house cat. I just thought: "This is me. I need to be a badger",' he told News Corp.

'I sat there and looked at him on the TV running around doing his thing, and I just went, "I want what he has".' 

'One of the stories which inspired me is that it is documented that a honey badger killed a male lion in a one-on-one battle,' he told Fairfax Media.

'What happened was that he clawed the canastas off the big fella, going the old one-two. The big fella walked around the corner and fell over. The honey badger got up, shook himself, and just trotted off. For me, that was outstanding."

The reporter then asked the Badger to talk through his try during the mach while it was replayed on the screen. 

'Basically it was Oi!  Look - no give it here!' he said with great enthusiasm.

And as he watched himself fly over the line and score the try on the screen- he got even more excited.

'Oh you beauty! She’s opened up and he’s over! Bit of meat under the posts!'

The Badger was asked if he was going to join his former Aussie team mates after the match.

'We'll go to some sort of function we’ll have a few schoots and who knows what can happen from there mate' the character quipped causing the reporter to start laughing.

It was pointed out that Cummin's father was in the crowd to watch the game. 

'Thank god he just got here in time – we went out last night and saw him and he’s over the moon mate,' he said.

'He come down here today and he almost had a little tear in his eye which bloody means a lot to me, so mate tonight I’ll enjoy it with him.'

The in-form 26 year old decided to move to Japan in August after his father was diagnosed with prostate cancer -  he is a single dad with has eight children - two of whom suffer from cystic fibrosis

The in-form 26 year old decided to make the big move to Japan in August after his father, Mark Cummins, was diagnosed with prostate cancer, as the Japanese league is known for offering massive cash incentives usually taken up by players nearing the end of their careers.

Named The Queensland Father of the Year in 2012, Mark, who became a single dad five years ago, has eight children - two of whom suffer from cystic fibrosis.

Cummin's latest stellar performance has prompted Barbarians coach John Kirwan to call on Australia to do everything they can to get the valuable player back  in time for next year’s World Cup, Fox Rugby reported.

Kriwan said if he was Michael Cheika (Wallabies caoch) he would be trying to get Cummins 'home as quick as I could' who he described as a 'special athlete'.

'He just knows how to sniff out a try and I thought what he did defensively today was incredible,' Kirwan said.

However, Cheika said the decision was up to Cummins, who had signed a two year contract with the West Red Sparks, whether he moved back Down Under in order to be eligible to represent Australia in the World Cup next year.
