Communication: The 'top revision tips' are sent by text, Twitter, and Facebook, it was claimed today

Pupils are being distracted from exam studying due to their college sending them 'top revision tips' by text, Twitter, and Facebook, it was claimed today.

Students at Havering Sixth Form College in Hornchurch, Essex, say the 'obvious' messages are 'annoying' and are actually interrupting their A-level preparation.

Daily tips aimed at revising pupils include 'buckle down and try your best right from the start'.

Other advice has been 'create your 
own flash cards which summarises theories to help prepare for exams', 
'you can work and play but you need the correct balance', and 'work now 
and you'll reap the benefits later'.

Another message from Assistant Principal John Davis told students to drink water, saying 'keep hydrated - it's key to success'.

He also gave pupils a link to research that showed how drinking water could improve grades by around 10 per cent.

Yet one more tip from the school read 'make sure you are revising all your subjects - plan your time, do not waste a minute'.

But
many students say the 'top tips' are making them waste 'countless 
minutes' reading the revision advice sent to them in texts and on social
networking sites.

Student Khloe Walters tweeted last week: 'Wish Havering sixth form would stop texting me tbh (to be honest).'

Fellow student James Welsh sarcastically tweeted 'Very inspirational text from Havering Sixth Form - 'every minutes counts' apparently.' 

'You can't help yourself really, and then you end up looking at other messages and getting distracted.

'If they want us to pass our A-levels 
they should stop sending up these useless top tips, which are incredibly
obvious and of no help whatsoever.'

Chris McGovern, a former head teacher and chairman of the Campaign for Real Education, accused the college of 'nanny state meddling'.

He said: 'The school (college) seems to be suffering from a kind of examination neurosis that is only adding to the pressure on pupils.

It needs to give the pupils space to breath and to stop acting as nanny. Its actions are likely to be counter-productive.'

Principal Paul Wakeling denied that the college, which educates 2,500 16 to 18-year-olds, was distracting students and said the campaign had been positively received. 

He said they provided daily tips via Facebook and Twitter but had only sent about three revision texts so far to students who were signed up to their mobile phone service.

Mr Wakeling said: 'Most of the students seem to really like it. Some have said they don't like it coming to their mobile phone and others say they do.

'We do send students texts every now and then, because they opt to give us their mobile phone numbers and it's another way of communicating to stop email.'

It is a useful way of communicating with them as usually when they wake up in the morning, the first thing they do is pick up their phones,' he added.

Jane Button, the college's leader in learner services, added: 'We have introduced texting and daily tips on Facebook and Twitter because social networking is now a part of every young person's life.

'It is a quick and easy way for us to get a short message across that will hopefully help students to achieve.'
