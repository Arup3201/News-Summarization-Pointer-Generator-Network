The world of football punditry is certainly a wacky one at the moment. In the olden days, the expert would more often than not pick their team, then stick with it. Nowadays though, that badge they kiss might as well be on velcro as they suddenly turn up worrying about quite how flat a back four is for all manner of channels.

With the ex-pros over at Sky Sports providing a notable exception, it would seem the story is very much, have big, intricately knotted scarf - will travel. The BBC and BT Sport have already clearly decided the entente is clearly cordiale in this matter as the latter's commentary teams proved more than compatible with Auntie's FA Cup output. While on the very same weekend, ITV stalwart Andy Townsend turned up at BT Sport so we could hear his thoughts on one of his former clubs, Middlesbrough. Although to be fair, in Andy's case, he is already hearing the retirement carriage clock ticking. So pick it up by the little brass handle, Andy, and get busy!

BT is also where we last saw Paul Scholes doing his new thing. Which is very much in his case, since retiring from playing, talking. Scholes was employed to fill one of the zippy old sports car seats on BT's Fletch & Sav show. Robbie 'Sav' Savage being perhaps the prime example of a man who seems to have his name on a mug in both channel's kitchens.

And those of you who saw it will know that he really seemed to enjoy the experience alongside his elaborately-haired former Manchester United youth team-mate. Because he looked like he'd got to reminisce about a form of transport Robbie used to apparently favour. At least, that's what I assume was happening when Scholes laughed gently to himself in the studio, then muttered under his breath 'moped'. Yes, I've watched it back. He is DEFINITELY talking about Robbie's old two stroke engine motorbike.

Come Tuesday evening, Scholes was back. And it was now his turn to turn the other channel. Paul was now over on ITV as part of their revamped football coverage. Adrian Chiles is now officially providing his face for radio. With one of the airwaves' finest, Mark Pougatch taking his place in the process. And for this return to the channel's coverage of the Champions League, one of Chiles' old sparring partners - well, you did get the feeling he'd loved to have given him a little dig - Roy Keane was also now back to share his thoughts with us. Although I would have been very surprised if, as a result, Scholes then decided he'd have a giggle at the expense of this former Red Devil's preferred mode of transport.

Instead, what we saw was a very steady piece of sport telly. No longer pitchside, but still stood al fresco amongst the crowd dressed like an am-dram production of 'On The Town' (Sinatra fans will understand), this new line-up absolutely hit the stands running. Indeed, so seamless was it, the only mild controversy was the fact that Roy described it all as 'if anything, pretty boring'. Which is fair enough. That can be how these games are sometimes. But you could certainly argue that at least what Pougatch did as a result was not choose to try and wring blood out of a stone. Taking his pundits through the procedure with no fuss or histrionics, this was very much a steady start for the new ITV line up.

To the point where Jose Mourinho even played ball in the post-match interview. In fact, the only real drama we saw was David Luiz moving the referee's disappearing foam at a free-kick. The crazy mophead. Oh, perhaps THAT'S who Paul Scholes was talking about?
