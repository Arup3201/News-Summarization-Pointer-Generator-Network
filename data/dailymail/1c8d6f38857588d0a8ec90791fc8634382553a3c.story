Terrence Jones was arrested in Portland and accused of stomping on a homeless man's leg outside a downtown nightclub

Houston Rockets forward Terrence Jones was arrested in Portland, Oregon, on Wednesday after police caught him stomping on a homeless man's leg.

A police sergeant making sure people remained orderly while they left a downtown club shortly after 2 a.m. saw the 250-pound, 6-foot-9 Jones walk by a doorway where two homeless men were sleeping and yell â€˜Wake Up!" before lifting his foot and stomping on one man's leg, said Sgt. Pete Simpson, a Portland police spokesman.

NBA player Jones, 21, was booked into the Multnomah County Jail on a misdemeanor harassment charge. He was later released on his own recognizance.

The homeless man, identified as 46-year-old Daniel Kellerher, suffered a minor leg injury that did not require immediate medical attention, Simpson said.

Jones, who could not immediately be located for comment, graduated from Portland's Jefferson High School before attending the University of Kentucky.

The Rockets selected Jones with the 18th pick of the 2012 draft. He played sparingly in his rookie season, averaging 5.5 points in 19 games.

Rockets spokeswoman Tracey Hughes said the team had no comment, and Jones' agent, Arn Tellem, did not immediately return a phone message left with his secretary Wednesday.
