Targeted: Paula Reed, who had been fashion director at Harvey Nichols for a year

The fashion director of Harvey Nichols has resigned after animal rights activists accused her of breaking the exclusive department store’s no-fur policy.

Paula Reed, who had been in the job for a year, was targeted in a campaign by the radical group People for the Ethical Treatment of Animals.

Under her direction, clothes trimmed with fox, rabbit and raccoon fur made their way on to the shop floor despite the company’s decade-long ban.

Peta complained to the store’s chief executive, Joseph Wan, and staged a protest outside its Leeds branch on Friday, when Miss Reed finally resigned.

In the days before she quit, animal rights protesters had sent more than 5,000 emails and thousands of messages on social networks urging her to stop selling fur. Her departure was announced two days after Mr Wan was understood to have met Peta representatives furious about the fur-trimmed clothing.

Miss Reed, who is married to architect Alfred Munkenbeck, told her 11,000 Twitter followers: ‘Funny how things turn out.’

Last night she declined to comment when approached at her £4million Victorian terraced house in west London.

Peta claimed: ‘After receiving confirmation in a meeting with Joseph Wan that Reed was single-handedly responsible for breaking Harvey Nichols’ strict, decade-long policy against selling fur, Peta hopes her resignation will pave the way for the reinstatement of the department store’s previous, well-respected policy.

‘We ask Harvey Nichols to realign itself now with the ethical values of the British public – 95 per cent of whom would never wear real fur and who rightly regard the industry as one of the most violent, bloody and barbaric on the planet – and reinstate its ban on fur.’

Peta said it did not know the official reason for Miss Reed’s departure, but added she had resigned after its meeting with Mr Wan.

Mr Wan said: ‘I am saddened about Paula’s departure and I wish her well in the future.’

After resigning, Miss Reed said: ‘I have thoroughly enjoyed working with the team at Harvey Nichols and now look forward to new and exciting opportunities.’

Harvey Nichols could not be reached for comment yesterday.

In 2004, the store stopped selling fur after protests, but started doing so again last month.

Miss Reed previously worked as style director at Grazia magazine and has held senior editorial roles at The Sunday Times, Harper’s Bazaar and InStyle. She began her career as a fashion PR for Lynne Franks, the publicist said to be the inspiration for Edina in the TV show Absolutely Fabulous.
