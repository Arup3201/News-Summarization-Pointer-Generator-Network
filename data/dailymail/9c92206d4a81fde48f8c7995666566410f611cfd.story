Japanese scientists have found a way to decipher dreams for the very first time.

Their report shows that patterns of activity in certain visual parts of the brain are the same whether we are awake or dreaming.

Researchers from ATR Computational 
Neuroscience Laboratories in Kyoto, Japan, scanned three male 
volunteers' brains in an exhausting test over several days to examine 
how activity could be related to their dreams.

Japanese scientists have found a way to tell what people dream about by carrying out research on three men

Researchers scanned the volunteers' brains as they slept to monitor activity over several days

The volunteers were woken up every time they began to nod off and dream. Each time, the men were asked what they had dreamed about before they fell back to sleep.

The process was repeated until an enormous 200 reports had been collated from each man.

The results showed that most of the dreams were about mundane, everyday life.

The research found that the most commonly occurring themes in the dreams included cars

The volunteers were also asked to view images of items that they often dreamed about, such as computers, as  their brains were scanned for a second time

The volunteers were then asked to view images of the most commonly-occurring themes, such as 'car', 'man', 'woman' and 'computer', as their brains were scanned again.

It enabled the scientists to identify patterns in three parts of the brain, which processes what the eye sees.

They also found that activity in a number of other areas of the brain, which have a particular focus on visual processing, varied according to the dreams.

Yukiyasu Kamitani of the ATR Computational Neuroscience Laboratories in Kyoto, Japan, told Nature News: 'By analysing the brain activity during the nine seconds before we woke the subjects, we could predict whether a man is in the dream or not, for instance, with an accuracy of 75 to 80 per cent.'
