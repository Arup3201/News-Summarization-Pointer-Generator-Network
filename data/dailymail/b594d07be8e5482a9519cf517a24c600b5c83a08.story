Two men have been arrested over the fatal M25 horror crash that closed the motorway for 12 hours after a lorry smashed through the central reservation. 

Thousands of drivers were trapped in eight miles of tailbacks after a man died in the 'catastrophic' four-lorry pile-up on one of the busiest stretches of the motorway.

The victim, believed to have been a 39-year-old from Leicester, was found dead at the scene and three more were injured when a lorry ploughed through the central reservation in Essex. 

Two men, aged 33 and 25, have been arrested on suspicion of causing death by dangerous driving. Both are still being treated in hospital and are due to be questioned by police later.

'Both are receiving treatment in hospital and will be interviewed in due course.' 

Motorists were trapped and some vehicles ended up on the wrong side of the road after the crash near Waltham Abbey at 1.50am, which closed the motorway between junctions 25 and 27 for more than 13 hours.

A man, believed to have been a 39-year-old from Leicester, was pronounced dead at the scene of the crash between junctions 25 and 27 in Essex, causing huge queues of at least 8 miles

More drivers were left trapped in vehicles after the 'catastrophic' crash on the motorway near Waltham Abbey at 1.50am

The road partially re-opened at 3pm with 'two lanes open in both directions between junctions 25 and 27 with a 40 mile per hour speed limit on the lanes that are running', the Highways Agency said. 

As rush hour got underway this evening, one lane remained closed anti-clockwise between Junction 27 for the M11 and 26 at Waltham Abbey and two were closed clockwise as contractors worked to repair the barrier.

There were reported delays of around 15 minutes.

Chief Inspector Jonathan Baldwin, of Essex Police, said the road was a 'catastrophic scene of carnage'.

Police had to close the M25   in both directions between junctions 25 and 27 causing miles of queues between Enfield and Epping. It was also shut for two more junctions to Junction 23, where the M25 meets the A1(M) until this afternoon. 

Essex Police said today that one person was killed and three others were taken to hospital following the incident.

Issues: As rush hour got underway two lanes remained closed between Junction 27 for the M11 and 26 at Waltham Abbey in both clockwise and anti-clockwise directions as contractors worked to repair the barrier

Deserted: These Highways Agency cameras show how miles of the M25 were empty after part of the motorway was shut 

Inspector Dick Thomas, from Essex Police, said: 'At this time we have one confirmed fatality and a number of people who are trapped in their vehicles.

'There is debris across both sides of the M25 and the motorway will be closed for the foreseeable future while we deal with this collision and begin our investigations to establish what has happened.

'If it is at all possible motorists are advised to avoid the area and find alternative routes. 

There are also currently delays of about one and a half hours on the M1 southbound between junctions 20 and 18.

This is due to resurfacing works after a lorry carrying cheese caught fire.
