Two bodies have been found following a search for a pair of missing climbers off the coast of Anglesey.

The bodies, which have not been formally identified, were recovered from the sea this morning by a team of rescuers, including an RAF helicopter, police and the coastguard.

Two climbers - a 48-year-old man from Sussex and a 21-year-old man from Hampshire - were reported missing from the South Stack cliffs near Holyhead at 10.15pm yesterday.

The men were supposed to meet two fellow climbers, who raised the alarm when they did not arrive at their destination.

A search operation involving RAF 22 
Squadron, the coastguard and North Wales Police was stopped at 1am this 
morning and resumed at first light.

North Wales Police told MailOnline that the force is trying to track down relatives of the missing climbers.

Lifeboats from Holyhead and Trearddur 
Bay joined a coastguard team from Holyhead and Cemaes Bay and a Sea King
helicopter from RAF Valley in the search below Gogarth Bay near the 
South Stack cliffs.

Teams from the RAF, coastguard, police and lifeboat service searched below Gogarth Bay for the men, who were reported missing from South Stack

A police spokesman said: 'The bodies 
were located in the sea shortly after 7.15am today. The North West Wales
Coroner will be informed.'

An RNLI spokesman said: 'Late Saturday night Holyhead all-weather lifeboat and inshore lifeboat were requested to search the area of North Stack for two overdue climbers.

'Items were located by coastguards at the top of a cliff and a large air, land and sea search was mounted.Â 

'It's a very popular area for climbers. The cliff rescue team train there. This is very sad.'
