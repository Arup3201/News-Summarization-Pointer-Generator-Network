Steven Gerrard would have been delighted to make a return to action after injury, but there was something else that also made him smile at the Liberty Stadium on Monday night.

The Liverpool captain was named on the bench for the Premier League clash and came on in the second half in south Wales.

While warming up along the touchline in the first half, Gerrard stopped to greet a young fan who had made his own replica kit with the 34-year-old's name on.

Unfortunately the spelling of 'Gerard' left a lot to be desired, but the Liverpool captain appreciated the tribute.

Gerrard was back in action for Liverpool in their 1-0 win over Swansea after missing the last seven games with a hamstring injury.

Jordan Henderson's second-half goal was enough to earn Brendan Rodgers' side a victory that drew them within two points of fourth-placed Manchester United in the race for Champions League football.
