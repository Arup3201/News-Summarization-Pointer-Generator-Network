A sickening video captures the moment when a have-a-go hero was hit in the head and face with a machete when he tried to fight off a gang during an attempted robbery.

Milton Tharmalingam was beaten with a heavy metal chain and then slashed across the head and face during the attack in a Merseyside shop.

The 36-year-old shop worker was left staggering around SRE M News and Wine in Litherland, with blood pouring from a gaping head wound.

The gang burst into the shop at about 10pm on Sunday. Two of the men wore skeleton-style masks and wielded heavy steel chains.

Shocking CCTV footage shows Mr Tharmalingam bravely fighting with the gang.

He can be seen rushing at them and grappling with them, before throwing himself at the group.

He is thrown to the floor and is thrashed with chains by the gang, who surround him and appear to hit and stomp on him.

A second member of staff then comes to his rescue and throws a stepladder across the shop at the gang as Milton lies on the floor.

In desperation the brave shopworker throws himself onto the gang of armed men in a bid to stop them

Milton Tharmalingam, 36, suffered a serious wound to his head after being attacked with a machete

At this point the gang decide to abandon the raid, although one of the men then attacks Milton with the machete.

The CCTV footage shows the thug 
lifting the machete into the air and bringing it down on his face and 
head as the gang flee empty-handed.

Milton said: 'The chains were very thick and heavy. One of them was left behind, which we passed to the police.

'My back is still marked from the beating. I did not know they had a machete too, that is why I jumped on them.'

A shocked customer helped Milton after the attack and phoned the emergency services.

Milton was taken to Fazakerley hospital by ambulance where he spent the night.

He now has ten stitches in his forehead and a scar on his face.

Canagasabai Sritharan, who owns SRE M News and Wine, said: 'Both members of staff in the shop at the time are heroes.

But I have told them that they need to put their own safety first next time.

'I bought the shop in 2005 and we were trouble free until the last couple of years.

'We had a knife raid about 13 months ago, when my wife was behind the counter. She found the ordeal very upsetting.

'I think we need more CCTV cameras on this road. A neighbouring business was held up by a gunman last December.

'But I will continue trading. This shop is my family’s livelihood. It is all we have.'

An hour before the raid four masked men burst into the Nisa Local store on Park Lane in Netherton.

Two members of the gang entered the back office and forced a worker to hand over cash at knife point.

He thrust a large kitchen knife toward the woman’s face and then flashed it inches from her face when he was leaving.

Police said the two incidents could be linked because of the short time and distance between them.

The four offenders are described as white and were wearing mainly dark clothing.
