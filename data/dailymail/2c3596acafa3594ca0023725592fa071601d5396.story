A Russian weight-loss group has been criticised for urging its members to follow a 'blockade diet' in memory of the Siege of Leningrad.

Get Thin Like Me invited its followers to go on a diet based on the rations supplied during the siege to 'honour' World War II veterans.

The Siege of Leningrad, when Nazi Germany forces surrounded the city for nearly 2.5 years, saw 630,000 people die of starvation in what is now St. Petersburg.

Inappropriate: Weight-loss group 'Get Thin Like Me' invited its Facebook followers to go on a 'blockade diet' based on the rations supplied during the Siege of Leningrad, which saw 630,000 people die of starvation

The 'blockade diet' was posted on Get Thin Like Me's Facebook page to coincide with the 71st anniversary of St Petersburg's liberation from the siege.

'Watch your figure and commemorate the Leningrad siege at the same time!,' the post urged, according to The Moscow Times.  

'We'll load up at the rate of factory workers doing a full day's shift in December 1941 - 400 grams of bread, and as many glasses of water as you like. 

'Men can have 100 grams of vodka at night, but only in place of bread,' the post said.

The Get Thin Like Me group also helpfully posted a recipe for 'blockade bread', including some ingredients only available in pet shops.

Dark days: Food was so scarce during the 1941-1944 Siege of Leningrad that residents were forced to eat pets, dirt and glue, and some even resorted to cannibalism

Horror scenes: Dead bodies littered the streets of Leningrad, now St. Petersburg, for days during the siege as the survivors were too weak to bury the deceased.

The post was met with a barrage of criticism, with several Facebook users accusing the weight-loss group of being insensitive and dishonouring the memory of the victims. 

The Siege of Leningrad began on September 8, 1941, when Nazi forces fully encircled the city, three months after launching Operation Barbarossa against the Soviet Union. 

The city of almost 3 million civilians - including about 400,000 children - endured rapidly increasing hardship. 

Most of them died of hunger and exhaustion during an extremely cold winter at the beginning of the siege from 1941 to 1942 when rations fell to just 125 grams of bread per person for white-collar workers and municipal heating was switched off.

People were forced to eat pets, dirt and glue, and some even resorted to cannibalism. Dead bodies littered the streets for days as the survivors were too weak to bury the deceased.

By the time the siege ended on January 27, 1944, 872 days later, an estimated 630,000 people had died, but some historians estimate this number to be closer to 800,000.
