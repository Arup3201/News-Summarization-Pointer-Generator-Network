This is the silver dome-shaped object spotted by hundreds of UFO believers at a paranormal conference.

Footage of the glowing light was captured by a film crew at the Probe International Conference in Blackpool on Sunday, prompting references to the X Files, with its slogan 'I want to believe'.

Onlookers said they thought the UFO was a balloon at first but it hovered in the sky for an hour before vanishing from sight under the cover of passing clouds.

This is not the first time Sam Wright, 70, from Blackpool, who runs Probe International, and his followers have seen a UFO at their conference.

He said: 'We have one or two conferences a year over a weekend and they are attended very well by around 400 people or more over the two days.

'I've seen UFOs and ghosts but I don't really like to talk about it because people think you're an idiot.

'We last saw one three years ago at a conference but only about 20 people saw a silver cylindrical object zoom past us very fast.

The Ministry of Defence revealed that around 2,000 UFO sightings nationally have been reported between 2000 and 2009.

But the government's UFO hotline - or 'X-Files desk' - was closed in 2009.

Documents from The National Archives showed there were more than 600 that year, more than double the previous year and three times the usual sightings per year.
