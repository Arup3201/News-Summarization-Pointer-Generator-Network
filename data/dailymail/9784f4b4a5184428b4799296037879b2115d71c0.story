The top of Euro 2016 qualifying Group B is a 'great place to be', according to Gareth Bale.

The Real Madrid forward put in another man-of-the-match performance as Wales beat Cyprus 2-1 on Monday night.

They now have seven points from nine and head to Belgium next for a crunch tie.

'It was a great start, we came out of the blocks and got the start,' Bale told Sky Sports 5 after David Cotterill and Hal Robson-Kanu scored early on.

'We made a little mistake off a set-piece (for the Cyprus goal) but you can see how much the lads want it. We're fighting for each other and the team spirit is amazing. The fans were unbelievable.'

Wales had to hang on after Andy King was sent off but Bale added: 'We worked hard and covered every blade of grass and showed how much we wanted it.

'It's a great place to be. It'll be a big game against Belgium and we'll go there full of confidence.'

Team-mate George Williams added: 'I loved it. It was a great team performance.'
