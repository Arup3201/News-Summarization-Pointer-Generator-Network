A helpless dog owner watched from five-feet away as her beloved two-year-old Chihuahua-pug mix Paco was ripped to shreds and eaten by a brown bear on the front porch on Monday.

Having moved to Sitka, Alaska, only in January, Paula Myers had bemoaned to friends she hadn't yet laid eyes on one bear.

Now, after having witnessed her treasured pet's vicious death, the health professional has vowed to shoot the bear dead if it comes back to her property again.

Tragic: Paco the Chihuahua-pug mix was eaten alive on Monday in front of his terrified and shocked owner in Sitka, Alaska

Friends: Paco and Prissy, his pug friend at home with Paula Myers - who lost her beloved pet on Monday

'I had not seen a bear yet,' Myers said Wednesday to the Anchorage Daily News. 'I had no idea it would be 5 feet from my house, eating my dog.'

The shocking run-in occurred on Monday evening at 6pm when Myers returned home and opened the doors to let Paco, who weighs six-pounds and her other pug named Prissy outside as she took her groceries inside.

She then heard Prissy 'scream' and rushed onto her decking to see Paco pinned under a brown bear's paw just five-feet away.

The bear, which is estimated to be three or four-years old, 'had just put his huge paw on the little dog and ripped him to pieces.'

'I screamed and screamed at the bear,' said Myers, who rushed inside to get a gun, but couldn't find it as her mind went blank from the horror of the situation.

Instead she called state troopers and waited for them to arrive as the bear sat in front of her home eating Paco for 10 minutes.

Recent move: Paula Myers is a healthcare professional and recently moved from Oklahoma to Alaska - and prior to Monday told friends she was looking forward to seeing her first bear

'That bear had no fear of me whatsoever. He never even acknowledged my presence,' Myers said.

'It was horrifying,' Myers said. 'The worst part was how helpless I felt.'

Troopers arrived and scared the bear away and later found the remains of Paco.

Myers told the Anchorage Daily News that she thinks her dog thought the bear was a large dog.

This was because he had never set eyes one before because she brought him with her from Oklahoma in January.

She thinks that Paco approached the bear and lay down to submit to it.

'I really think the whole thing was just accidental,' she said. 'But once a bear has found a food source, he comes back.'

That evening the bear returned and Myers and her partner Brad Langdorf fired shots from a pistol in its direction to scare it off.

They called troopers back and then called out representatives from the Alaska Department of Fish and Game.

Myers denies that she and her partner have been naive in their attitudes towards living in Alaska.

She told the Anchorage Daily News that she knows Sitka, an island community with 9,000 people, is prone to bears.

However, the incident shook her so much that she contemplated leaving the state altogether but she says now she has decided to stay, fight and 'put her war paint on.'

She has bought a shotgun and is ready to 'never, ever let that happen again.'

Fearsome: The bear (not pictured) that ate Paco has not been found yet, but Paula Myers has purchased a shotgun should it return

However, since her harrowing account was published on Wednesday, Myers has been responding vigorously to criticism she has received online.

Thanking the large majority of well-wishers, upset for her loss, Myers has choice words for the 'hard asses'

Small: The little Chiuahua only weighed six-pounds and may have thought the bear was another larger dog to play with

'I knew there were bears here when I chose to live here. Just because it's Alaska doesn't mean that me and my tiny dog do not have the right to feel safe in our own home,' said Myers on Facebook to commenter's online.

'A close encounter with a bear is much like labor, no matter how much you read or how many women describe it to you it does not become real until you have experienced it.'

Venting her fury at another commenter, Myers said that she is prepared to fight for her property against the encroaching bear and is not afraid to use lethal force.

'I will burn the entire forest on my 2 acres if that's what it takes to live here safely,' said Myers.

'I did not disturb this bear, he is a rogue and came into my yard and killed my dog within 5 feet of my porch in broad daylight.

'If he returns to my house again I have already made the decision and preparation to blow his f****** head off.'

Currently the bear has not been located, although Alaska Fish and Game are waiting to see what the bear will do.

They have said their options are to use a stun gun to scare it off or to drug it and transport it elsewhere on the island.
