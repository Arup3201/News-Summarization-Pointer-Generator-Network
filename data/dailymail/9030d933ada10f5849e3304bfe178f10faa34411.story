A convicted felon is on the run after a four-year-old boy died of a gunshot wound.

Trevor Braymiller, 25, fled the boy’s rural Washington home on foot after a four-year-old boy he allegedly shot Sunday morning died from a gunshot wound originally thought to be accidental was ruled a homicide.

As a convicted felon, Braymiller is not allowed to own firearms.

On the run: Trevor Braymiller, 25, is on the run after he was named as a suspect in the death of a four-year-old boy. Reported to also have a one year old child, he is seen here holding an unidentified child

Still alive when police arrived shortly after 7am. The boy was transported to a local hospital where he succumbed to his injury, according to multiple reports. He has yet to be identified.

The incident occurred in Sedro-Woolley, WA, a town about halfway between Seattle, WA and Vancouver, BC, Canada.

Authorities initially ruled the shooting an accident, believing the boy had tragically shot himself after he found the gun and was playing with it, according to reports.

A post-mortem examination revealed otherwise and cops began calling the scene an active homicide investigation, causing Braymiller to run, stations reported.

Braymiller wasn’t the boy’s biological father, but he did help raise the boy. The convicted felon also has a one-year-old daughter, KOMO reported.

Though cooperating with police, Braymiller’s mother and girlfriend told KING ‘this may not end well’ and urged him to turn himself in.’

Lumberjack: Braymiller works for a local family-owned logging company

Braymiller has a significant criminal history, according to KING, but attempts by MailOnline to reach local officials for more details were unsuccessful. Police conducted a raid in the house they responded to Sunday and that cops have seized weapons from Braymiller before, KOMO noted.

Police departments from Sedro-Woolley and the neighboring towns of Burlington and Mount Vernon, as well as sheriff’s deputies from two counties and Washington State Patrol Troopers are all searching for Braymiller, the Skagit Valley Herald reported.
