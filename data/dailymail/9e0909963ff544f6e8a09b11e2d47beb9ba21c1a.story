He started work as the White House's 'Ebola Czar' in October.

But now, Ron Klain is stepping down from the position to return to the private sector, it is reported.

The 53-year-old, a former chief of staff to Vice President Joe Biden, will apparently leave his role in the Obama administration by March 1 following a widely-criticized and very short tenure.

Instead, he will return to his former job as President of Case Holdings and general counsel for former AOL chief Steve Case's venture firm, Revolution LLC, according to Fortune magazine.

'He has no intention of staying on in any other capacity here at the White House,' an administration official told the magazine. 'Ron will do the job for which he was appointed and return to Revolution.' 

Klain was tapped by the White House on October 17 to coordinate the federal response to the outbreak of the Ebola, which has so far killed more than 5,000 people, mainly in West Africa. 

Speaking of Klain's appointment, Mr Case said his employee 'was not eager to take on' the position, but felt it was 'an important thing to do' and understood that 'it would be for a limited period of time'.

During his short tenure, Klain was widely condemned for not being visible during the peak of the outbreak of the deadly virus, leaving others, such as President Barack Obama, to face the public.

Indeed, only two weeks out from the midterm elections, the spread of Ebola appeared to be defying official assurances to the American public that the situation  was under control.

Nurses Nina Pham, 26, and Amber Vinson, 29, contracted the disease after treating Liberian patient Thomas Eric Duncan, 42, who died from the virus on October 2, revealing the flaws in Ebola protocols.

And in subsequent days, Congressional calls for a travel ban from the West African nations of Liberia, Sierra Leone and Guinea to the U.S. only enhanced public concern toward the outbreak. 

Then in late October, Dr Craig Spencer made national headlines after he rode the subway, visited a Manhattan restaruant and went bowling in Brooklyn while infected with Ebola.

Dr Spencer, 33, was declared virus-free and released from New York's Bellevue Hospital on November 11 following 20 days in isolation. 

However, while he was in hospital, poll results released by CNN revealed that many Americans felt that Klain was not doing a 'good job' to reassure the public about the Ebola outbreak.

Klain was conspicuously absent from several conference calls and meetings, while Conservatives were questioning his credentials - particularly the fact that he had never handled a health crisis before.

In defense, the president's spokesman claimed that Klain's position was a managerial one, and his sole responsibility was 'coordinating the whole-of-government approach.'

'He has performed very well in that task,' press secretary Josh Earnest said, adding that the fruits of his labor are 'already being felt, at the White House and across the government'. 

On November 17, Dr Martin Salia, who contracted Ebola in his native Sierra Leone. died in a Nebraska hospital, bringing the U.S. death toll from the virus to two.

But in recent weeks, no new cases have emerged and Ebola has largely faded from the public eye.

Last week, the White House issued a progress report, saying that, under Klain’s leadership, 32 new treatment facilities were designated to deal with Ebola, according to the New York Daily News.

Twenty-nine laboratories were also newly equipped to test for the disease, while increased screening measures at U.S. airports were put into place, the report said.   

And on Sunday, the New York State Department of Health said that there were currently no cases of Ebola in the state.

'Protecting the well-being of New Yorkers is the State’s top priority,' Governor Andrew Cuomo said. 'And we are continuing to exercise an abundance of caution when it comes to dealing with Ebola.' 

Fading from public view: In recent weeks, no new Ebola cases have emerged and the virus has largely faded from the public eye. Above, health workers clean out Mr Duncan's apartment in Dallas, Texas, in October

Rumors: There was speculation that Klein would stay on in the White House in another role, potentially as Counselor to the President if John Podesta (pictured) quit to run a Hillary Clinton presidential campaign

Klain's role as 'special government employee' was always meant to be temporary, according to Fortune, with such short-termers typically expected to stay on the job no longer than 130 days.

However, there was speculation that he would stay on in the White House in another role, potentially as Counselor to the President if John Podesta quit to run a Hillary Clinton presidential campaign.
