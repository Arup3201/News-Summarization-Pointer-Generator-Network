It's already the most successful song from a Disney film in 20 years.

But a university student from Texas has ensured Let It Go from Frozen will resonate with cartoon fans of all ages by singing it in the voices of 21 different Disney and Pixar characters from almost every classic film.

Brian Hull, a 22-year-old vocal performance major from Dallas Baptist University, impersonates classic characters such as Winnie the Pooh, Mickey Mouse, Sebastian from The Little Mermaid, Lumiere from Beauty and The Beast, and Scar from The Lion King.

He also belts out the hit song as more recent Disney favourites, including Captain Jack Sparrow from the Pirates Of The Caribbean franchise, Dug and Alpha from Up, and Ray from The Princess And The Frog.

Mr Hull produced the video, which has already wracked up more than 1.4 million YouTube plays at the time of writing, in order to win a $100 gift card in a competition.

Experts suggest his popular video will have already earned Mr Hull more than $1000 from YouTube, with that number only expected to increase.

He told examiner.com that the virality of his video is completely unexpected.

‘The night before I submitted my video, I was having second thoughts about how good it was, so I posted it to my Facebook, just so I could get honest feedback from my friends. The next thing I know, they shared it over 200 times and now, the video has over a half million views in a day and a half,’ he said.

Let It Go was the hit song from the 2013 film Frozen. The song won the Academy Award for Best Original Song at this month’s Oscars, where it was performed by Idina Menzel, who played Queen Elsa in the film.

It also made it to the top ten of the Billboard Hot 100, the first Disney song to do so since 1995 when Colors of the Wind from Pocahontas reached number four on the chart.

Mr Hull hopes that his video not only wins the competition, but also reminds people of the Disney classics.

He wrote on his YouTube page: ‘With so many covers of Let it Go coming out, people may forget the original Disney magic that this song has, so what better way to preserve that magic (than) with other Disney and Pixar characters singing the song!’
