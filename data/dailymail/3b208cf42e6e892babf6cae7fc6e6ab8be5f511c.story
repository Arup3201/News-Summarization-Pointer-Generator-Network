A San Francisco strip club is suing Oracle after one of its employees ran up $33,540 in charges on a company credit card.

The incident happened at the New Century Theater last October during the tech giant’s annual Oracle OpenWorld conference.

The club originally reached out to Oracle about the unpaid bill, but when they refused to pay they started legal proceedings.

Despite the on-going legal action, the club is continuing to offer a discount to convention-goers at this week's Oracle event which started on Sunday

According to the lawsuit, the employee - identified as Jose Manuel Gomez Sanchez - used his Oracle-issued American Express card to charge $16,490 in unspecified ‘services’ during the early hours of Oct. 2 2012.

The employee then returned two nights later and rang up another $17,050 in charges, reports SFGate.

Oracle has declined to comment on the lawsuit, which was filed in San Francisco Superior Court, just as OpenWorld 2013 kicks off.

The five-day conference is the most important educational and networking event of the year for Oracle technologists, customers, and partners.

It brings an estimated 60,000 conventioneers into the city from over 144 countries.

New Century bills itself as ‘San Francisco's premier all nude gentleman's club’ and is even offering a discount to convention-goers this year.
