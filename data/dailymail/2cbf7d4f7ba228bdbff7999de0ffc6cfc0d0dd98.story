Justin Bieber told Orlando Bloom 'Say hi to Miranda for me!' just moments after the actor tried to punch him in an altercation when they ran into each other in an Ibiza restaurant.

The 20-year-old singer was reported to have got 'very close' to the model at an after-party at a New York hotel following the Victoria's Secret show in 2012, while she was still married to Bloom.

Today, Miranda, 31, apparently tried to turn her back on her ex-husband's antics as she posted a picture of herself with their three-year-old son Flynn - swiftly followed by a provocative shot of her topless in the bath from her new campaign for 7 For All Mankind Jeans.

The model, who is rumoured to be dating Australian billionaire James packer, curiously wears a band on her ring finger in the picture.

In a sneak peek video for the campaign, Miranda lies on a bed and says in a Marilyn Monroe-esque voice:

'I love them... I love them,' referring, no doubt, to the jeans.

The incident between her estranged husband and Bieber, which happened in the early
 hours of Wednesday morning, took place at the Cipriani restaurant on the Spanish Island of Ibiza, which was packed with 
celebs, including Paris Hilton, and Diddy.

An onlooker told MailOnline: 'As Justin walked off 
he made the jibe at Orlando, which was only going to make him more 
angry.'

Clearly
 trying to irritate the situation further, Bieber then posted a picture 
of Miranda in a bikini with a symbol of a crown as a caption.

Making an entrance: Bieber, wearing a white T-shirt and customary baseball cap, enters Ciprianis with his entourage

New footage, obtained exclusively by 
MailOnline, captures the moment actor Orlando Bloom throws a punch at 
Justin Bieber during a night out in Ibiza.

The
 incident was recorded by onlookers as Bieber crossed paths with the 
Pirates of the Caribbean star shortly after entering popular eatery 
Cipriani with his entourage.

Bloom, who wears a light coloured shirt, appears to make a beeline for the Canadian star before throwing a single punch.

Bieber's security team promptly pull the two apart before the incident spills over into the street. 

As members of their entourage engage in a
 scuffle to keep the two stars apart, Bloom is seen walking away before 
returning to gesticulate at Bieber, who sports one of his customary 
baseball caps.

Bieber can reportedly be heard in the video of the incident, yelling, “What’s up, b***?” to Bloom.

Just what incited the incident is still a matter of confusion.

TMZ reports that one version has Bieber extending his hand to Orlando, who refused it. When the singer asked what the problem was, he mentioned Miranda. As Bieber tried to walk away - Orlando 'swung'.

A second version has Bieber telling Orlando that he slept with his wife - prompting Orlando to swing.

Following the incident Bieber greeted fans, seemingly oblivious to the ugly scenes that had just played out with the British heartthrob.

As a throng of predominantly female onlookers neared, he cheerfully obliged them by posing for a series of snaps.

He also appeared to make light of 
his altercation with Bloom by grinning as a members of his team 
playfully raised his fists. 

And the following day, on Wednesday, Bieber put the bust-up behind him as he played about on his yacht with actress Michelle Rodriguez, and also took to the waves on a jet-ski.

While 
representatives for Bloom and Bieber have refused to comment on the 
matter, a source on the scene has confirmed the incident to MailOnline.

We're told: 'Justin was being cordial, and everything was fine. 
But then Orlando was annoyed when he saw it was Justin and instigated by
 taking a swing at Justin.'

'Justin ducked, and Orlando's punch missed'.

Our source adds: 'People intervened, some minor pushing, then they were separated. Justin stayed for a while after.'

Turning her back: Miranda Kerr today posted an Instagram photo of her with young son Flynn Bloom

Bieber was seen with Bloom's now estranged wife Miranda an an after-party at the 2012 Victoria's Secret fashion show at a hotel in New York.

MailOnline has been told that stunned onlookers watched on as the pair went off together.

Miranda and Bloom announced their separation in October 2013 after three years 
of marriage, claiming they had split several months earlier.

As soon as rumors swirled of a possible fling with Bieber, Miranda's lawyers quickly sent out a letter calling such claims 'false and defamatory'.

Meanwhile, there is bad blood between Bieber and Bloom as the actor also has ties to Bieber's ex, Selena Gomez; in April they were 
spotted partying together at the Forum in LA after taking in Chelsea 
Handler's Uganda Be Kidding Me show.

Earlier in the day Bloom was seen with pretty women on a yacht in the Ibiza area. Erica Packer - the former spouse of Australian billionaire James Packer, who himself has been linked to Miranda, is thought to be one of them.

On Tuesday, Bieber shared a photo where he was boarding a private jet with a pal. Both were shirtless and showing off tattoos.

It is likely they were headed to Spain.

Meanwhile, Kerr was seen in Munich, Germany at an Escada event on Tuesday.

Also on Tuesday, TMZ reported that the Beverly Hills building in which Bieber has been living is hiring lawyers to deal with the star.

He has allegedly been making so much noise with his parties that police were called six times in one weekend alone this month to his unit.
