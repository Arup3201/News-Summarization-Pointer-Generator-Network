A new dating app, LUXY,  allows singles to weed out poor and unattractive matches.

Like Tinder, users can swipe through potential dates anonymously, and will only be matched with suitors who find them mutually attractive.

However, on LUXY, the average male user earns over $200,000 a year, and those who are 'unable to keep up financially' are immediately removed from the app.

Only for the rich: On LUXY, the average male user earns over $200,000 a year, and those who are 'unable to keep up financially' are immediately removed from the app

'With the rise of high-speed digital dating, it's about time somebody introduced a filter to weed out low-income prospects by neighborhood,' says the app's mysterious CEO, who will only name himself as Tim T.

He claims that everyone would secretly love to date someone both attractive and wealthy, and that his app is merely helping to facilitate those types of matches.

LUXY says its members include CEOs, professional athletes, doctors, lawyers, investors, entrepreneurs, beauty queens, fitness models and even Hollywood celebrities. 

Signing up for the app is similar to Tinder and other modern dating service. Users are first prompted to log in via Facebook so that the app can analyze their connections. 

Once logged in, you're asked to select from a list of hobbies. Unlike a normal dating site, the list of hobbies caters exclusively to the well off. Gourmet dining, horseback riding, racquetball, golf and boating all qualify as acceptable hobbies, whereas more modest pastimes such as thrifting or going for a bike ride are strictly off limits. 

Wealth quiz: Signing up for the app is similar to Tinder. Users  log in via Facebook so that the app can analyze their connections. Once logged in, you're asked to select from a list of hobbies and favorite brands

After indicating the appropriate interests, users are to identify their favorite brands. As with hobbies, it's important to select 'high class' interests. Among the list of acceptable brands are Louis Vuitton, Mercedes, Gucci, Bentley and Cartier. Users who enjoy washing down their Big Mac with a cool can of Pabst Blue Ribbon after a long cruise in their VW Bug are sadly unwelcome on LUXY.

Finally, users are asked to state their income. The app defaults to $350,000 a year, however users are free to disclose assets over $1million.

While the company says it's currently working on building safeguards against not-so-wealthy-users, at the moment they rely on a self-correcting system.

A quick swipe through potential LUXY suitors yields an investment banker who attended Princeton and enjoys rolex watches, a motorcycle collector who enjoys boating and earns nearly half a million per year, and a young fashion-crazed millionaire from Glasgow.

Show-offs: The wealthy users are also encouraged to share 'moments' from their luxurious lifestyles to prove that they're not just low-income posers

The wealthy users are also encouraged to share 'moments' from their luxurious lifestyles to prove that they're not  low-income posers. You can cross-post these moments to Facebook and Twitter, where the photo will appear with the hashtag #luxurymoments.

Many moments consist of glamourous selfies and snapshots from exotic locales. One user uploaded an image of herself in a white Bentley captioned, 'On our way to the Ivy!' while another boasted a large Yves Saint Laurent box with the message, 'Gorgeous new pumps from YSL! I <3 <3 <3 them!!'. A male user in Florida got straight to the point and uploaded an image of himself with fists full of $100 bills. 'Casino flow' he noted.

Currently the app only has around 3,000 members, however it's growing quickly as wealthy users are encouraged to invite their rich friends.

And if those friends happen to fall into lower income brackets? 'For those on a month to month budget, the company recommends looking at either OkCupid.com or Match.com,' a company spokesman advised.
