It's the most McHappy of circumstances.

An embarrassing situation for McDonald's has now escalated as the fast food giant temporarily shut down their now-infamous staff-only website, McResource Line, on Wednesday after it was revealed the chain had been lecturing employees not to eat take out.

The same site hit headlines earlier this year for urging employees to sell their things and get second jobs to make ends meet.

A graphic on the homepage read: 'Fast foods are quick, reasonably priced, and readily available alternatives to home cooking. While convenient and economical for a busy lifestyle, fast foods are typically high in calories, fat, saturated fat, sugar, and salt and may put people at risk for becoming overweight.'

Good idea, bad idea: McDonald's didn't think its employees should eat the food they serve, as seen in this graph from their staff website McResource Line, which was pulled down this week

'We are temporarily performing some maintenance in order to provide you with the best experience possible. Please excuse us while these upgrades are being made,' it said.

McDonald's confirmed the site had been taken down, CNN reported.

'A combination of factors has led us to re-evaluate and we've directed the vendor to take down the website,' they said in a statement.

'Between links to irrelevant or outdated information, along with outside groups taking elements out of context, this created unwarranted scrutiny and inappropriate commentary.

'None of this helps our McDonald's team members.'

The anti-fast food advice was given with graphics depicting the ‘unhealthy choice’ and the ‘healthier choice.’

Despite featuring a vast array of deep fried delicacies, the Golden Arches reminded employees that ‘avoiding items that are deep fried are your best bet.’

Solid advice: Don't eat at McDonald's. The fast food chain were forced to admit the embarrassing and 'outdated' information on their site has lead to a temporarily shutdown for 'upgrades'

The sensible advice also told McWorkers to ‘limit the extras such as cheese, bacon and mayonnaise.’

Such tasty add-ons are staples of many menu items they serve on a daily basis.

A
 hamburger, fries and soda were warned against, because ‘eating a diet 
high in fat puts people at rick for becoming overweight.’

Many
 locations offer steep food discounts and short breaks to employees, 
virtually forcing them to eat the unhealthy food, often forcing the hand
 of workers without the time or means to eat elsewhere.

‘It is hard to eat a healthy diet when you eat at fast-food restaurants often,’ the advice continued.

‘Many foods are cooked with a lot of fat, even if they are not trans fats. Many fast-food restaurants do not offer any lower-fat foods.’

The world’s largest fast food chain wants employees to eat elsewhere.

‘Eat at places that offer a variety of salads, soups, and vegetables,’ the site says.

This advice comes after a series of tips telling employees find second jobs, apply for food stamps and sell their things to weather a financial crisis. 

The site also gave advice on how to tip au pairs, doormen, personal trainers and pool boys.

Before shutting down the site, a McDonald's spokesperson said the messages had been ‘taken entirely out of context.'

Embarrassingly, McDonald's admitted the take-down was due to the site containing 'outdated information' that 'created unwarranted scrutiny'
