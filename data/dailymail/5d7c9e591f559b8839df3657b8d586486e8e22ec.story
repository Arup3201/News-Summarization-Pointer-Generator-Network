Julie Burchill has a knack for raising eyebrows. 

Despite years of outspoken columns in national newspapers, the writer still now never fails to drop a new tit-bit of information that leaves jaws hanging open - most recently the fact that she was into bondage as a teen. 

She has admitted this today in her latest job role as an Agony Aunt for the revamped Loaded magazine, after receiving a letter from a man whose wife - hot under the collar from the new Fifty Shades Of Grey film trailer - is demanding they get kinky in the bedroom.

During her reply, Julie, 55, reveals that at just 17 years old, the same time that she started working as a reporter for NME magazine, she also started a relationship with a man who indulged in regular S&M. 

She said: 'To be perfectly frank, I was into this sort of palaver in a BIG way when I was a girl.

'I was just 17 when I knocked on the door of one of London’s most notorious sadists and suggested that he show me what it was all about.

'My interest in being thrashed lasted into my 30s, whereupon I developed a sense of humour and suddenly couldn’t so much as look at a pair of nipple clamps without howling with laughter.'

 

She continues: 'S&M, like love-bites and Maoism, can look lovely on the young and pretty. But there’s few things funnier than a fat middle- aged fetishist.'  

Julie then goes on to advise her new pen pal, who is extremely reluctant to get involved in extreme bedrooms antics, to play his wife at her own game by wholeheartedly taking to bondage in one session in an attempt to put her off for life. 

She said: 'There’s a theory that the reason women are throwing their collective undercrackers at Christian Grey is because, in an age of perceived male non-commitment, he is obsessed with Anastasia.

'Women are big on being seen as ‘special’ and ‘unique’ and all that crap, so it’s not hard to imagine that this is the real appeal – not the fluffy handcuffs and silky bonds.

'Your best bet is to go the whole hog with the aim of putting her off completely.

'Chuck out the silk and fluff and bring in the hardware - stick a ball-gag in her mouth, chain her to a chair and beat her intensely for a full five minutes.

'Then release her and ask innocently, 'Was I doing it hard enough?”

'Chances are, if she’s just a masochist manque, she’ll be desperate to return to vanilla sex with maybe just a tiny bit of swearing on the side.' 

Deputy Editor of Loaded magazine, Lia Nicholls said of their decision to hire Julie as an agony aunt: 'There aren't many brave enough to admit they were thrashed about during bondage sessions well into their 30s. 

'That's one of the many reasons why Julie Burchill is so brilliant.

'When Loaded first started, Barbara Ellen was the mag's opinionated feminist

'Now, for the relaunch of Loaded, we've appointed Julie as our resident agony aunt, a huge coup.

'In the mag's current issue, as well as bondage, Julie also gives her opinion on infidelity, prostitution and global warming.'

The September issue of the newly revamped Loaded magazine, featuring interviews with Keira Knightley and Jessica Alba, is out now.
