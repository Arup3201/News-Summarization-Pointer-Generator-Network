About 100 people have been rescued without injury by firefighters after a monorail at the Dallas Zoo stopped operating following an electrical fault on Saturday.

Dallas Fire Rescue spokesman Jason Evans says as many as five extension ladders at a time were used to remove the passengers from the ride above the Giants of the Savanna exhibit.

The train was around 20 feet off the ground when it stopped and the 93 people were trapped for about 40 minutes before being rescued one-by-one. A similar incident happened at the zoo in 2011.

'Opportune': While the ride stopped 20 feet above the ground, it wasn't directly above any animal habitats

Fortunately, the monorail didn't get stuck above any animal habitats.

'It stopped a very opportune place because it was such a low point there, very accessible,' Sean Greene, Dallas Zoo Vice President of Guest Services told NBC.

'It didn't impede any animals, didn't impede the experience over the elephants. But obviously for those 93 passengers they would like to have completed their journey.'

Evans says firefighters responded to a 911 call about 3:30 pm after what is thought to be an electrical problem caused the train to stall.

He says the 30-minute rescue was made easier because firefighters had easy access to the passengers. All 93 people were refunded for the ride.

Fox News reports that the monorail also suffered an electrical fault around 18 months ago. In September 2011 a breaker shorted out, trapping 30 passengers for an hour.

The zoo is not yet sure if the problem on this occasion was in the same car. The attraction was shut down on Sunday as engineers worked out what caused the malfunction.

Jerry Davis, one of the people rescued, told NBC: 'Actually [this was] my wife's first time on the monorail. I've been on it once before and this was definitely a first.'

The zoo's website says the monorail is the only one in the U.S. that can 'climb and turn, taking guests on a one-mile tour through bush, desert, forest, woodland, river and mountain environments.'

The website adds that Giants of the Savanna habitat, open since May 2010, provides an interactive experience for guests built around the species of animals that call the savanna home: elephants, giraffes, impalas, zebras, ostriches, lions, warthogs, red river hogs, guinea fowl, and cheetahs.
