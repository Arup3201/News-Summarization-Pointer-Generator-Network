Cannibal? Arihano Haiti, 33, was found guilty of killing Stefan Ramin on Nuku Hiva, in French Polynesia, and sexually assaulting his girlfriend

A South Sea Islander accused of killing and eating a German adventurer has been jailed for 28 years for murder.

Arihano Haiti, 33, a registered tourist guide, was found guilty of killing Stefan Ramin on Nuku Hiva, in French Polynesia, and sexually assaulting his girlfriend.

A judge ruled that Haiti would have no possibility of parole until he has served at least 18 years of his near three-decade sentence.

Mr Ramin, 40, and his girlfriend had been on an island hopping adventure in the South Pacific when he was killed and she was assaulted.

The crime shocked the tiny island of Nuku Hiva which, with a population of just more than 2,000, was previously best known from the stories of Herman Melville, author of Moby Dick.

Haiti was first arrested in 2011, amid claims that he had taking Mr Ramin hunting then killed him, carved him up and eaten parts of his body before setting fire to what remained.

He then returned to where Mr Ramin's girlfriend was waiting, tied her up and sexually assaulted her.

He fled when she escaped and raised the alarm, going on the run for 50 days before giving himself up.

A French Polynesian court heard that investigators were unable to prove the claims of cannibalism and prosecutors accused Haiti of shooting the German man with a bullet in the head, cutting up the body and then burning it.

Mr Ramin and his girlfriend had moored their Turkish-bought catamaran Baju off the coast of Nuku Hiva on September 16, as part of a planned two-year stint island hopping around Polynesia.

Mr Ramin had hired Haiti - a guide registered with authorities on the island - to take him into the island's interior on a goat hunt. He never returned.

Police say Haiti went back to the boat to try to lure Mr Ramin's girlfriend into the jungle by claiming that Mr Ramin had had an accident and needed help.

Desperate claims: Haiti had claimed in his defence that he shot Mr Ramin and attacked his girlfriend because the German had sexually assaulted him

She was suspicious and refused to go with him, but he had then ended up sexually assaulting her anyway and tying her to a tree.

After she escaped human and alerted authorities, Mr Ramin's burnt remains were found.

Among the embers investigators found a jaw bone, teeth and melted metal - believed to be fillings.

Mr Ramin, a fanatical sailor, was a former business adviser. He kept a regular blog of his trip which begun in 2008 and one of his last entries read: 'I seek freedom and adventures'.

On Facebook, he listed his interests as 'travelling, blue water sailing, kiting, kitesurfing, windsurfing, surfing, diving... actually everything which one can do on and under the water'.

Haiti had claimed in his defence that he shot Mr Ramin because the German had sexually assaulted him. After killing Mr Ramin, he said, he decided to sexually assault his girlfriend in revenge for his own assault.

But detectives in Germany working together with the local investigators say they had found no evidence that the German had had any homosexual tendencies.

A lawyer for the dead man's family, Yves Pirou, said that the accused's allegations were a pure work of fiction.

He said the reality was exactly the opposite and while there was no indication that the victim had any homosexual tendencies, Haiti was known to have had regular contact with transvestites and the probability is far more likely that he had raped Mr Ramin or at least tried to rape him.

This was backed up by investigators who pointed out that Haiti was physically far bigger and stronger than Mr Ramin. In addition a physical examination of Haiti after he was arrested had shown no indication that he had had suffered any sexual assault.

Haiti's lawyer Vincent Dubois said that the hunter was not a monster and argues that it was clear something went wrong on the trip to the mountain.
