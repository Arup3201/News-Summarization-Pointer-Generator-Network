Enemy No 1: Internal emails released by the Defense Department show that no U.S. sailors witnessed Osama bin Laden's burial at sea aboard USS Carl Vinson

Internal emails among U.S. military officers indicate that no American sailors watched Osama bin Laden's burial at sea from the USS Carl Vinson, and traditional Islamic procedures were followed during the secret ceremony.

The emails, obtained by The Associated Press through the Freedom of Information Act, are heavily blacked out, but are the first public disclosure of government information about the al-Qaida leader's death. The emails were released Wednesday by the Defense Department.

Bin Laden was killed on May 1, 2011, by a Navy SEAL team that assaulted his compound in Abbottabad, Pakistan.

One email stamped secret and sent on May 2 by a senior Navy officer briefly describes how bin Laden's body was washed, wrapped in a white sheet, and then placed in a weighted bag.

According to another message from the Vinson's public affairs officer, only a small group of the ship's leadership was informed of the burial.

‘Traditional procedures for Islamic burial was followed,’ the May 2 email from Rear Adm. Charles Gaouette reads. ‘The deceased's body was washed (ablution) then placed in a white sheet. The body was placed in a weighted bag.

‘A military officer read prepared religious remarks, which were translated into Arabic by a native speaker. After the words were complete, the body was placed on a prepared flat board, tipped up, whereupon the deceased's body slid into the sea.’

Final destination: Bin Laden's body was taken to an unknown location aboard USS Carl Vinson and dropped into the sea, but the Defense Department says that it cannot find any images showing the terrorist mastermind's remains on the ship

The email also included a cryptic reference to the intense secrecy surrounding the mission.

‘The
 paucity of documentary evidence in our possession is a reflection of 
the emphasis placed on operational security during the execution of this
 phase of the operation,’ Gaouette's message reads.

Recipients
 of the email included Adm. Mike Mullen, then the chairman of the Joint 
Chiefs of Staff, and Gen. James Mattis, the top officer at U.S. Central 
Command. Mullen retired from the military in September 2011.

Earlier,
 Gaouette, then the deputy commander of the Navy's Fifth Fleet, and 
another officer used code words to discuss whether the helicopters 
carrying the SEALs and bin Laden's body had arrived on the Vinson.

‘Any
 news on the package for us?’ he asked Rear Adm. Samuel Perez, commander
 of the carrier strike group that included the Vinson.

‘FEDEX delivered the package,’ Perez responded. ‘Both trucks are safely enroute home base.’

Although
 the Obama administration has pledged to be the most transparent in 
American history, it is keeping a tight hold on materials related to the
 bin Laden raid.

In a response to separate requests 
from the AP for information about the mission, the Defense Department 
said in March that it could not locate any photographs or video taken 
during the raid or showing bin Laden's body. It also said it could not 
find any images of bin Laden's body on the Vinson.

The Pentagon also said it could not 
find any death certificate, autopsy report or results of DNA 
identification tests for bin Laden, or any pre-raid materials discussing
 how the government planned to dispose of bin Laden's body if he were 
killed.

The Defense Department also refused to confirm or deny the existence of helicopter maintenance logs and reports about the performance of military gear used in the raid.

One of the stealth helicopters that carried the SEALs to Abbottabad crashed during the mission and its wreckage was left behind. People who lived near bin Laden's compound took photos of the disabled chopper.

The CIA, which ran the bin Laden raid and has special legal authority to keep information from ever being made public, has not responded to AP's request for records about the mission.
