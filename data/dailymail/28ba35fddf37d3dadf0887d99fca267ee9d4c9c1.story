It was harder work than many expected. And, for a spell, it looked as if a man whose day job involves sticking his hand down cludgies was going to be responsible for plunging Rangers into crisis.

Yet Ally McCoist’s men ultimately managed to avoid having their League Cup hopes flushed away by Queen’s Park at Airdrie’s Excelsior Stadium on Tuesday night.

A Kris Boyd double either side of a Tony Quinn equaliser, the Carntyne plumber capitalising on a Steve Simonsen howler, was eventually enough to put Rangers into a second-round tie against Inverness Caledonian Thistle.

With the third-round draw coming on Wednesday, they may be presented with the prospect of a truly tantalising reward for getting past the Premiership side. But they’ll certainly have to improve on this performance in order to overcome Caley Thistle.

On a night when other teams were playing their second-round ties, Rangers were clearly eager to make up for lost time in this delayed match.

Queen’s Park, decanted from their traditional home while wondrous athletics venue Hampden is ‘restored’ to its natural state as a football ground, were under pressure from the opening moments, only the brilliance of goalkeeper William Muir preventing the loss of a goal after just two minutes.

Nicky Clark’s cross from the left flank was perfect for the inrushing Lee McCulloch, whose full downward header was somehow diverted off target by the diving Muir.

Rangers had signalled their intent and, after Arnold Peralta — recalled in place of David Templeton who was relegated to the bench — had sent a 25-yarder fizzing wide, Muir quickly found himself beaten.

 There was nothing the goalie could do as Nicky Law was given time and space to pick out a cross from the right wing, Boyd then doing what he does best, somehow making himself isolated amid a forest of leaping bodies to score with a perfect header.

There were just seven minutes on the clock and, in truth, such an early opener should have been the cue for an absolute onslaught by the visitors.

Indeed, if Lewis Macleod’s headed ‘goal’ a minute later hadn’t fallen foul of an offside flag, it would have been hard to see a way back for the Spiders. Yet they survived.

They clung on despite seeing little ball. They watched as Rangers kept possession, spread play, whipped in crosses, took the odd shot and gradually ran out of momentum.

The small knot of home fans thought for a moment that they’d be cheering a penalty when Vinnie Berry — one of three Queen’s Park players signed from Clydebank Juniors in the summer — went down under a Macleod challenge inside the box.

No dice, said referee Alan Muir, who booked Paul Woods for diving just seconds later.

They would not be denied their moment, though.

 All it took was one speculative free-kick into the box — and one horrendous misjudgement by Simonsen, the former Everton and Dundee goalie getting nowhere near the ball and watching in agony as the mighty Quinn’s looping header completed its slow-motion arc into the net.

Simonsen spoke just last week about the social media shock he’d experienced after his Scottish Cup semi-final error last season. Best stay off Twitter for another wee while, Steve.

Not that the big Englishman would have been alone in attracting the ire of Rangers fans during a fairly unimaginative first half.

It was hardly surprising that they ran out late for the second 45; if McCoist didn’t have a lengthy lecture to deliver, there would have been something very wrong.

There was certainly more tempo about the visitors after the break, Bilel Mohsni stooping to head an effort off target just two minutes in.

It was no more than a half chance, Clark having drilled the ball in from close range on the right after a free-kick play had set the Queen’s defence back on their heels.

Their second goal arrived from similarly broken play, a series of crosses and balls into the box causing havoc before Peralta’s chipped cross found an unmarked Boyd ready, willing and more than able to nod the ball into an empty net. Simple.

And surely a sign that the storm had been weathered by a superior team who would now add a third or fourth by way of insurance. Nice theory.

In practice, while Clark saw a point-blank shot blocked by David McGregor and Macleod sent a low drive cracking off the foot of the post, the visitors continued to be troubled by their hosts. From Mohsni gifting possession by trying to be too clever, to Simonsen grinning in gratitude as Ross McPherson directed a back-post header straight at him, there was nothing comfortable about Rangers’ lead.

Still, in Macleod, they had the best player on the park. He was involved in all their brightest moments, including a corner that saw Mohsni’s goal-bound heard cleared off the line by Berry late on.

Looking forward to the next round, Rangers boss McCoist said: ‘Let’s be honest, Caley are the in-form team in the country at the moment. They’ve not lost a goal. We will certainly have to be more disciplined — but the good thing is we get a chance to play them at home now.

‘I was pulling my hair out in the first half, with the number of free-kicks we were giving away. Our lack of discipline was a big concern.

‘For their goal, once Simo comes, he has to get it. I’m not sure he had to come, I’ll watch the video tomorrow.

‘There are positives to be taken, the biggest one being that we now have a home tie against Inverness. But there are negatives I need to look at.’
