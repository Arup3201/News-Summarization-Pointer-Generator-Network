The brother of one of the French Alps massacre victims has denied hiring a hitman to kill the family over a £1million-plus inheritance feud.

Accountant Zaid al-Hilli, 54, was arrested at his home in Surrey yesterday morning on suspicion of conspiracy to murder.

His brother Saad al-Hilli, 50, was killed in a gun attack in France that left three others dead and Saad’s daughters Zainab, eight, and Zeena, five, orphaned.

Probe: Police officers carrying evidence leave a block of flats on North Parade in Chessington, Surrey where Zaid Al-Hilli, the brother of Saad Al-Hilli, was arrested yesterday

In an exclusive interview with the 
Mail, Zaid said he loved his brother and did not ‘know how he could have
 been killed in this terrible way’.

As police made the first arrest on the case nine months after the killings, it emerged that:

Saad al-Hilli died alongside his wife 
Ikbal, 47, and her mother Suhaila al-Allaf, 74, when the family’s BMW 
was riddled with bullets near Lake Annecy in September.

French cyclist 
Sylvain Mollier, 45, was also killed as he passed by the scene, while 
Zainab was  injured but has since recovered.

In an interview prior to his arrest, 
Zaid told the Mail: ‘I am at a complete loss as to what has happened.

'There have been reports that there was a row over money with my brother 
but that is not the case.

‘I have told the British police  
everything I know and all I can do now is wait for them and the police 
abroad to come up with some answers. To me this is all a total mystery.’

Looking gaunt and tired, Zaid said he had not been ‘eating or sleeping well’.

‘This is my family that has been 
killed and I am suffering greatly,’ he added. ‘Like everybody I want 
answers and I hope in time we will find out what happened.

'There has 
been a lot of people speculating but I hope in the end the police find 
who was responsible.’

Zaid was questioned by detectives at a
 Surrey police station yesterday after being arrested at his flat in 
Chessington at 7.30am.

The arrest is the first significant 
development in the inquiry.

Around 100 police officers in Britain and 
France have been tasked with investigating the killings, and they have 
focused on three lines of inquiry: Saad’s work as an engineer, his links
 to his native Iraq and the alleged family feud.

Zaid was questioned by French police 
in March over the alleged inheritance dispute.

The men’s father, who was
 Iraqi, died in Spain two years ago, leaving several properties and 
hundreds of thousands of pounds in the Geneva account.

Saad had hired lawyers to block the 
will until the dispute had been resolved.

Mr Maillaud, Annecy’s public 
prosecutor, claimed Zaid had attempted to fabricate his father’s will in
 his favour.

‘It looks like he tried to take the 
fortune for himself,’ Mr Maillaud said.

‘Formal and written evidence 
leaves no doubt about the very violent family dispute that pitted the 
two brothers on the issue of the inheritance of their father.’

Statement: French prosecutor Eric Maillaud confirmed the arrest of Zaid Al-Hilli but said, 'It does not confirm his guilt'

Peaceful spot: Walkers on the remote 3 km track to the scene of the attack outside the village of Chevaline where the Al-Hillis were murdered

Prayers: Saad Al-Hilli, 50, his wife Iqbal, 47, and her 74-year-old mother Suhaila Al-Allaf, were laid to rest in the same grave last year

Mr Maillaud said the ‘family dispute 
is so colossal’ it would take investigators two years to go through the 
legal papers, in English, Arabic, Spanish and Swedish.

‘Based on letters we found and 
conversations he [Saad] had, he feared for his life,’ Mr Maillaud  
added.

‘In these letters he expressed his worry for his life due to his 
desire to recover his father’s fortune and the conflict it caused with 
his family. That fear was there.’

Saad Al Hilli kept a Taser at his home in Claygate, Surrey and had 
changed the locks of the £1million property (pictured)

Saad reportedly kept a Taser stun gun 
at his £1million home in Claygate, Surrey, and changed the locks before 
he went on holiday.

The extent of the alleged feud was 
laid bare in a letter Saad wrote to a childhood friend a year before his
 murder.

He said he and his brother were no longer speaking, adding: ‘He
 tried a lot of underhand things even when my father was alive. He tried
 to take control of father’s assets.’
