It’s a question that internet communities have fought over for eons: is ‘gif’ pronounced like the world ‘gift’, or ‘jif’, as the maker recently said it should be said?

Thankfully the public consensus on this and 43 other tech-related words of phrases has been revealed in a survey of 1,000 people by eBay Deals.

From the most popular terminology for a portable computer to the way most people describe the internet itself, some surprising results are revealed in the survey.

In a survey of 1,000 people eBay Deals asked how they say popular tech words and phrases, such as the correct terminology for an animated image (pictured). Other questions revolved around how they refer to the internet and also what the correct word for a portable computer is

Taking a look at some of the most intriguing results, the correct terminology for a data stick that plugs into a computer was up for debate.

While 60.8 per cent described it as a flash drive, 8.39 per cent called it a memory stick and 6.65 per cent a jump drive.

Portable computers were less contentious – 91.89 per cent agreed they were called a laptop.

Lol - 60.89 per cent

Hahaha - 17.23 per cent

LMAO - 11.39 per cent

ROFL - 3.74 per cent

ROFLMAO - 3.46 per cent

Other - 3.28 per cent

The correct terminology for a device to change the channel on a television was another interesting battle.

In this instance 65.45 per cent opted for remote, 21.97 per cent said remote control and 5.83 percent went for clicker.

Elsewhere the influence of Apple was evident in what people called a mobile digital media player.

While 47.30 per cent referred to it as an MP3 player, 48.57 per cent of the 1,000 people surveyed said they called it an iPod.

The pronunciation of some words may seem to be set in stone - internet for example - some people still insisted on different ways to say it, perhaps comically - in this instance 'interwebs'.

The correct terminology for a personal phone seemed to indicate the majority of survey respondents were American - 58.8 per cent said it was a cell phone and just 5.01 per cent referred to it as a mobile phone.
