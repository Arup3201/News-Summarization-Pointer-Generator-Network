Death sentence: Ex-cop Manuel Pardo is set to be executed next week after an appeal was denied

An ex-cop, languishing on death row for a string of murders committed during the 1980s, is set to be executed next week after his  latest appeal was denied.

Manuel Pardo, 56, and his partner Rolando Garcia committed nine murders as they ripped-off drug dealers before killing anyone capable of implicating them in the crimes.

At his trial in 1988, Pardo went against the advice of his lawyers and confessed saying his victims were drug dealers who 'have no right to live' and that he was ridding the streets of the 'scum of the earth'.

At Florida's Supreme Court his lawyers argued that the former highway patrolman, Scout leader and decorated Navy veteran was insane at the time of the crimes.

They also claimed the state’s new method of lethal injection, a cocktail of three drugs, would result in a painful death amounting to 'cruel and unusual' punishment. 

However in a unanimous decision the state rejected the appeals and his execution was scheduled for December 11.

Florida Supreme Court denied claims Pardo was insane at the time of the murders or that lethal injection would amount to cruel and unusual punishment

During the 1990s Pardo was dubbed the 
'Death Row Romeo' after placing lonely hearts adverts in newspapers and 
scamming vulnerable women out of hundreds of thousands of dollars.

His lawyers said they now plan to appeal to the U.S. Supreme Court with and that an additional case would be filed in a Jacksonville federal court.

If they fail to get a stay of execution Pardo will become the first inmate to be executed under the latest changes in the lethal injection procedure.
