He was almost put to sleep after failing a police dog induction test, and nearly died twice after getting a piece of bone wedged in his throat and eating a rotten chicken carcass.

But Stanley, a spaniel cross who never managed to become a police sniffer dog, has reached the final of a dog agility competition at Crufts next March in Birmingham after four years of training.

He now hands the washing to his owner Anne Higgins - who is a police inspector, along with her husband Mike - and even selects the pegs for the washing line at his home near Tiverton, Devon.

After
the couple rescued Stanley from being put down, they put in huge 
amounts of dedication and patience to train up the dog, which will show 
off his ability in the world’s most prestigious dog show.

But life could have been so 
different for Stanley, who failed the police induction because he had no
interest in toys or any play drive. Now he is an exceptionally-trained 
and fun-loving pooch.

Mrs 
Higgins said: ‘As a pair of new and naive dog owners we did not really 
understand about socialisation, training and the importance of 
puppyhood.

‘What we did 
know was this little dog needed a home and that we could not let him go 
to the council kennels, where there was a high chance he would be put to 
sleep.

Two escapes: Stanley almost died five years ago when he bolted down a piece of bone and got it wedged in his throat, before suffering poisoning in 2010 after wolfing back some rotten chicken

‘So, home he came and there it started. Four years of hard work, sheer determination on his part and ours, sleepless nights and tears.’

Anne Higgins

Stanley nearly died in 2007 when he bolted down a piece of bone and got it wedged in his throat, before suffering poisoning three years later after wolfing back a rotten chicken carcase.

Mrs Higgins added that Stanley had not been exposed to normal human events and was scared by sounds such as sneezes, clapping, zips, screams, laughter, cats fighting and bells.

‘He had quite clearly never been allowed to explore his environment and knew no cues, except perhaps “away” – which, if he ever got the chance, he executed to perfection,’ she said.
