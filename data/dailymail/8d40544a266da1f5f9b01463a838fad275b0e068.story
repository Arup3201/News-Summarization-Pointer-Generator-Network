A Washington mother whose two-year-old son died after taking meth pleaded not guilty to manslaughter in court Wednesday.

Alyia Iverson is accused of leaving drugs where her son Nathan could find them, and then doing nothing to help after he overdosed in December 2012.

Police claim that the 26-year-old failed to take action when she saw her son drink bong water. He took enough meth to cause an overdose in an adult, medical reports showed.

Charges: Alyia Iverson, pictured in court Wednesday, pleaded not guilty to manslaughter over the death of her two-year-old son

Overdose: Nathan died in December 2012 after drinking bong water and eating enough meth to kill an adult, medical reports say

The toddler would have shown signs of distress, including having convulsions and a fever, police say.

Prosecutor Mark Lindquist told KTVU it would have been 'painfully obvious' that the child was seriously unwell.

'Once the toddler ate that methamphetamine, there must have been a high fever, convulsions, maybe even seizures,' he said.

Nathan and his sister had previously been put into care in 2011, but Iverson later regained custody of her children when allegations of neglect were ruled unfounded.

It took more than 18 months for Iverson to appear at her arraignment because of investigations by police and child protection services.

A Child Protective Service investigation into Nathan's death found that caseworkers should have tried harder to follow the child's progress 'due to significant risks associated with the case'.

A report from the medical examiner found that Nathan died from acute methamphetamine poisoning and had also ingested THC, a component of marijuana.

Claims: Prosecutors allege Iverson failed to raise the alarm and that her son, Nathan, would have been in obvious distress and pain after consuming drugs

When paramedics arrived at the house Iverson was staying in, Nathan didn't have a pulse, and they struggled to fit a breathing tube because his jaw had locked.

According to KSDK, doctors treating Nathan at hospital noted that the child had several bruises and that his feet, finger nails and toenails were dirty.

Iverson has been barred from having contact from children and is being held on $250,000 bail.
