No red card, no clean sheet, no points. Neil Lennon’s second match in charge of Bolton could not have been much more different to the first.

Instead, having opened with a touchline dismissal and a win at Birmingham, this was something of a wake-up call.

First, George Tucudean and then Johnnie Jackson capitalised on shaky defending to put Charlton in control. Dean Moxey pulled one back in the 53rd minute with a sweet drive from 20 yards, but ultimately Bolton lacked the quality and ruthlessness for back-to-back wins.

That was never more evident than late in the first half. Darren Pratley had opened Charlton’s defence with a backheel which left back Moxey received on the overlap. His low cross was perfect but Beckford took a big swing and missed the ball altogether. It was a pitiful end to Bolton’s one move of genuine class in the first half.

By then they were already 1-0 down. Yoni Buyens made the chance with a delightful ball over the top which Tucudean took down and finished in a smooth, sweet motion.

Tucudean was then involved in the second, squaring for Johnnie Jackson to finish in the 51st minute before Moxey drilled home a low shot across Stephen Henderson from 20 yards two minutes later.

It was a good strike but not enough to turn the tide.

For Charlton, the win keeps them in the chasing pack. But it’s fair to say Bob Peeters’ side did not start this fixture like a unit that only tasted defeat for the first time at the weekend.

Inside two minutes Stephen Henderson spilled a weak shot from Lee Chung-Yong and had to scramble to gather the loose ball. Within four Neil Lennon was waving his players forward, such was Charlton’s frailty in possession.

Neil Lennon will have been disappointed in what he saw from his side in his second game in charge of Bolton

It was 27 minutes until they had a meaningful opening – Johnnie Jackson scuffing when well placed – and a minute later before they managed a proper shot, from which Tucudean scored for his second of the season.

Bolton, for all their hard work, didn’t have much quality to offer in the first half. Beckford’s miss was the low point, even if the move highlighted that they do have guile in the side.

Jackson made it 2-0 but Moxey gave Bolton a fighting chance with his impressive finish moments later and Beckford had a header cleared off the line.

Lennon said: ‘I think we should have got something but should doesn’t cut it in football. We don’t score enough and we concede too many but the standard of performance was very high.

‘We are losing games and I need to change that very quickly.’

Charlton manager Bob Peeters said: ‘Everyone said we were favourites to get relegated and now we have 22 points.’

Peeters also insisted he had no interest in the managerial vacancy at Standard Liege, who share a chairman - Roland Duchâtelet – with Charlton.

Peeters said: ‘I had a meal with him (Duchatelet) on Monday and I am very happy at Charlton. I am not leaving here. I made a commitment to Charlton.’
