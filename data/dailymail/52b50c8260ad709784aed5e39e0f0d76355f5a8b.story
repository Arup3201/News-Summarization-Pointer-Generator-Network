You are either going to love it or hate it.

A new Marmite cupcake has been developed which marries the extreme saltiness of the sticky, dark brown paste with the sweetness of caramel and chocolate.

The luxury treat, which costs £2.75, has been created by bakers at the London company Lola’s Cupcakes and is designed to appeal particularly to fathers.

The 
cupcake has a chocolate sponge, salted Marmite caramel centre and is 
topped with rich Marmite buttercream and chocolate ganache.

It
 is difficult to imagine a more unlikely combination, for Marmite is 
known for an extreme and overpowering flavour, generated from yeast 
extract, which is a by-product of beer brewing.

So
 intense is the flavour and the reaction it generates that the makers 
Unilever have played this up with the advertising slogan ‘Love it or 
hate it’.

The
 product that was to become Marmite was invented in the late 19th 
century when German scientist Justus von Liebig discovered that brewer's
 yeast could be concentrated, bottled and eaten.

In 1902 the Marmite Food Extract Company was formed in Burton upon Trent, Staffordshire, w n mhile the name came from the French word to describe a large, covered earthenware or metal cooking pot.

The product, which was made from yeast supplied by the Bass brewery, became so popular that a second factory was opened in Camberwell Green, London, in 1907.

In the early 1900s it was revered as a health food because it is rich in B vitamins and was issued to British troops in World War I as part of their rations to stave off conditions such as beriberi, which left them feeling weak and sick.

Asher Budwig, the managing director of Lola’s Cupcakes, said: ‘I’m always searching for ways to create innovative, exciting cupcakes with unusual ingredients. Marmite’s saltiness complements the caramel extremely well, but the centre will either be a shock, or a pleasure depending on where your Marmite sensibilities lie.’

A spokesman for Unilever, Joanne O'Riada, said: ‘Marmite may be best friends with toast, but why can’t it be with a cupcake? We expect it to divide the nation’s opinion and can’t wait to hear people’s thoughts.’

It will be stocked in Lola stores in Selfridges, Topshop Oxford Circus, Covent Garden, Brent Cross, Bluewater, Kings Cross Station and at the chain’s flagship store in Mayfair for four weeks.
