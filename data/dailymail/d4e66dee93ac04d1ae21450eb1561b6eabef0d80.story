Liverpool defender Alberto Moreno says he is relishing playing in their new 3-4-3 formation - citing the tactical change as beneficiary to the players capabilities in the squad.

Reds boss Brendan Rodgers has tinkered with their shape throughout the season, which has seen 4-3-3, 4-2-3-1 and 4-1-2-1-2 systems all deployed with varying results.

However, the Anfield outfit seem to have settled on a back three as their base with left-back Moreno now playing more offensive as a midfielder.

And the £12million summer signing is adamant that things can only get better - with Liverpool unbeaten in the league since a 3-0 defeat away at rivals Manchester United on December 14. 

'I played as a winger when I was younger. I really like this formation as I can attack more, which is one of the things I like to do the most on the pitch,' he told the club's official website.

'Of course, we also have defensive duties but this system gives me more freedom to attack. I like this formation as I think it suits the type of players we have very well - and things are unfolding well as a result. We'll continue to improve as a team if we keep doing things as we have.

'We are playing with three central defenders in addition to the two wingers, who help the team by defending and attacking. We're constantly looking to help the defenders with the assistance of our midfielders – Stevie (Steven Gerrard), Lucas and Hendo (Jordan Henderson) mainly.

'Everyone does their best to help both defensively and in the attack. I think it's very important that we play as a team and stay together - that's what's been helping us to get the points.'

Moreno, who started Tuesday's 3-2 Premier League win at home to Tottenham, has made 27 appearances in all competitions for Liverpool this season.

The 22-year-old is likely to be included in Rodgers' starting line-up for Saturday's FA Cup fifth round trip to Crystal Palace.
