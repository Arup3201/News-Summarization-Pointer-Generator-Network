Vodafone has come last in a series of checks by evaluators RootMetrics, who named it the provider most likely to cut you off

If you can’t make a personal appearance on Mother’s Day, it’s usually best to at least accompany your flowers with a phone call.

But you may want to avoid Vodafone, which a major national analysis has named as the network most likely to cut you off. The most reliable was EE, which was also named the best all-round operator.

Network evaluators RootMetrics conducted 840,000 checks and ranked the four main operators across a range of categories – overall performance, call performance, mobile internet, texting, network reliability and network speed.

Vodafone came last in all categories other than network speed, where it came second-last ahead of Three.

While EE performed best across all categories, Three was a close second in terms of reliability during the six-month study conducted last year.

The network also came second in terms of mobile internet and text services.

O2 came second in the call performance and network speed categories, but its reliability was better only than Vodafone’s.

Overall, EE was top on 84.6 per cent, Three second on 73.5 per cent, O2 third on 66.5 per cent and Vodafone last on 52.4 per cent.

Three said the study was ‘carried out prior to our launch of 4G at no extra cost, so is not up to speed with our current performance’.

RootMetrics chief executive  Bill Moore said the testing was designed to get as close to consumer experience as possible.

‘It is all  very well to test speeds, but if you can’t get on the network, the speed is irrelevant.’ He added that the UK networks’ failure rate, at two per cent, was four times higher than in the US.

A Vodafone spokeswoman said: ‘The testing does not appear to follow standard industry practices or be fully impartial, while it also incorporates data some of which  may well be over six months old.’
