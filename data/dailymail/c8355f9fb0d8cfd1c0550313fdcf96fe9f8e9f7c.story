Jailed: Maria Peguero, wife of baseball player Carlos Peguero, is beginning a year-long sentence for defrauding the wife of her husband's then teammate

A baseball star's wife is beginning a 
year-and-a-day spell in prison for using a debit card belonging to the 
wife of another player to rack up an online shopping bill of nearly 
$200,000.

Maria Peguero, 
wife of former Seattle Mariners outfielder Carlos Peguero, wept after 
hearing her sentence for the fraud, which she had admitted in an earlier
 hearing.

'I would just 
like to say, I'm sorry,' she had told the court before the judge passed 
sentence.

She had faced up to 20 years, but prosecutors chose not to 
recommend a specific sentence as part of her plea deal.

Her attorney told the court that she was pregnant, the Seattle Times reports.

Peguero
 pleaded guilty to wire fraud in February, after prosecutors said she 
used a debit card belonging to Sandra Hernandez, the wife of Mariners 
pitcher Felix Hernandez, to make $191,000 in online purchases.

Mrs
 Hernandez, a Spanish speaker, had asked Peguero for help with some 
internet shopping.

Peguero then used Mrs Hernandez's card details to 
make more than 60 purchases for herself from Saks Fifth Avenue and 
Nordstrom.

The crime was 
noticed by the card issuer, Morgan Stanley, which began to investigate 
when it noticed the delivery address on the transactions did not match 
with the billing address.

Some of the transactions were as high as $11,000 and used to buy items including a Gucci handbag.

Morgan
 Stanley reimbursed Mrs Hernandez when the fraud was discovered and U.S.
 Secret Service, which oversees federal cybercrime, filed the charges in
 Tacoma, Washington.

Kept in the dark: Carlos Peguero said he did not know his wife, Maria, was committing fraud

Peguero
 was sentenced at federal court in Tacoma, Washington, on Monday, after 
making a plea deal which included an agreement to pay restitution.

She was also handed a three year supervision order, beginning after her release from jail.

Peguero is the youngest daughter of late MLB reliever Pedro Borbon.

Dominican-born
 Carlos Peguero, who was in January traded by the Mariners to the Kansas
 City Royals, said he was unaware of his wife's fraudulent purchases.
