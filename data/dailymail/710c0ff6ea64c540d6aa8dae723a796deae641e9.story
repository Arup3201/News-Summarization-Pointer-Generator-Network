Landon Donovan has criticised coach Jurgen Klinsmann's tactics during USA's World Cup campaign, which ended with a 2-1 defeat by Belgium in the last 16.

Klinsmann stunned the nation when he decided to leave the 32-year-old Donovan, USA's record scorer, out of his 23-man squad for the tournament.

While Donovan has been careful with his words in his television appearances during the tournament, the team's exit prompted a pointed critique of the German coach's approach.

'I think the most disappointing is we didn't seem like we gave it a real effort, from a tactical standpoint,' he told mlssoccer.com.

'I thought the guys did everything they could, they did everything that was asked of them, but I don't think (tactically) we were set up to succeed... and that was tough to watch.'

Donovan said Klinsmann had turned away from the positive approach he had adopted since taking over the US team in 2011.

'They were set up in a way that was opposite from what they've been the past couple of years, which is opening up, passing, attacking - trying to do that. And the team has been successful that way.

'Why they decided to switch that in the World Cup, none of us will know. From a playing standpoint, I think the guys will probably be disappointed in the way things went,' he said.

After striker Jozy Altidore was injured in their opening win against Ghana, Klinsmann opted to play Clint Dempsey as a lone striker and Donovan said that was a negative approach.

Up in the air: Donovan is unsure whether he will return to the USA national team

'My feeling as a player, if I'm in that locker room before that game - before the Germany game, before the Belgium game - and the coach walked in and said we're playing a 4-5-1 and Clint is up top by himself, I would have been disappointed. Because I would have said let's go for it. I want a chance to go for it and try to win the game,' he said.

LA Galaxy forward Donovan also criticised the decision to play Michael Bradley in a more advanced role in midfield.

Donovan evaded the question of whether he expected to return to the national team ahead of next year's North American Gold Cup.

'We'll see. That depends on a lot of conversations that would have to be held,' he said.

On Wednesday, Klinsmann said he intended to turn towards young players in the coming year as he seeks out new talent for the national team.
