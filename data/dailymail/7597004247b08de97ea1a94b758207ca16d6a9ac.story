The next generation iPad will look something like a giant iPad mini, if these apparently leaked images are to be believed.

The pictures purport to show the back-plate of of Apple's fifth-generation tablet which, according to recent reports, should be available for iFans this autumn.

It comes as the Silicon Valley gadget maker officially announced the UK launch of a new addition to their current iPad range: a new premium 128GB model that offers double the storage of their previous top of the line tablet.

Unverified: This picture, first published by Apple fan site 9to5Mac.com, purports to show the backplate of the fifth-generation iPad, with an iPad Mini backplate shown on the right for comparison

The so-far unverified pictures of the iPad 5 backplate were published yesterday by Apple fan site 9to5Mac, which received them from 'a purported China-based iPad accessories maker'.

It is the second Apple leak in as many
 days after speaker block components apparently from the forthcoming 
iPhone 5S and iPhone 6 were pictured by French tech blog Nowhereelse.fr.

The source of the latest leak told 
9to5Mac their pictures show a prototype back piece for a 
fifth-generation iPad with a 9.7in display, and that the casing is 
almost as thin as the same component on the iPad mini.

A black antenna cut to the top of the plate suggests its for a model which includes 4G connectivity.

The next iPad had been expected to 
launch this spring, but recent indications are that it will not hit the 
shops until October. That delay in its release could explain why casings
 are currently floating around in China.

In the meantime, Apple today announced
 that a new 128GB model of its current-generation iPad will be available
 in the UK and U.S. from next week - just in time to take on the pro 
version of Microsoft's Surface tablet.

It will join the 16GB, 32GB, and 64GB 
fourth-generation iPads which Apple already has on the market and comes 
after Microsoft last week announced it was to market a pro version of 
its Surface tablet in North America from next week.

Apple will release a 128GB version of the iPad next  week, just in time to take on the latest top-of-the-line pro version of Microsoft's Surface tablet.

The forthcoming fourth-generation Apple tablet with a Retina display will not be a redesign of current models but rather an addition to the current line.

It will join the 16GB, 32GB, and 64GB fourth-generation iPads which Apple already has on the market. It will cost £639 for the WiFi model and £739 for the mobile internet-enabled version when it goes on sale through Apple shops and authorised resellers on February 5.

It comes after Microsoft last week announced it was to market a pro version of its surface tablet in North America from next week.

Powered by an Intel x86-type processor, the Microsoft Surface Pro will run a full version of the latest Windows 8 OS, allowing it to use fully featured Windows software rather than the slimmed-down apps currently available for Windows RT.

That has allowed Microsoft to position the gadget as a complete laptop replacement.

It comes in both 64GB and 128GB versions but, unlike Apple's tablets, does not have a SIM slot to enable connection to mobile networks. 

Apple has pitched the new premium 
model of the iPad squarely at the corporate market, pointing out in a 
release that 85 per cent of the world's top 500 companies are currently 
deploying or testing the machine.

'Companies regularly utilising large 
amounts of data such as 3D CAD files, X-rays, film edits, music tracks, 
project blueprints, training videos and service manuals all benefit from
 having a greater choice of storage options for iPad,' a spokesman said.

'The over 10 million iWork users, and 
customers who rely on other incredible apps like Global Apptitude for 
analysing team film and creating digital playbooks, Auria for an 
incredible 48 track recording system, or AutoCAD for drafting 
architectural and engineering drawings, also benefit greatly from having
 the choice of an iPad with more storage capacity.'

Like its more modest peers in the iPad
 range, the 128GB iPad 4 comes equipped with a .7-inch Retina display, 
Apple-designed A6X chip, FaceTime HD camera, iOS 6.1, WiFi and optional 
4G mobile internet.

It will cost £639 for the WiFi model 
and £739 for the mobile internet-enabled version when it goes on sale 
through Apple shops and authorised resellers on February 5.

The appearance of the iPad backplate 
pictures is the second purported leak in as many days of components 
expected to be used in forthcoming Apple products.

Yesterday MailOnline Science reported 
how images of what is believed to be parts of the forthcoming iPhone 6 
have emerged online for the first time.

Is this the first look at the next iPhones? The image purporting to show the speaker parts from the forthcoming iPhone 5S and iPhone 6. The same part from the current generation is shown not to scale

The photos, which the editor of French
 tech blog Nowhereelse.fr said he found 'while browsing the web', show 
speaker components which are similar to ones used in the iPhone 5.

They were apparently leaked online by 
an employee of the Far Eastern company which manufactures the parts for 
the Silicon Valley tech giant.

Both parts appear to be similar in 
design to the part currently used in iPhone 5s, but the one thought to 
be for the iPhone 6 is slightly smaller.

It is speculated that this could 
actually be designed for the as-yet hypothetical 4.8in iPhone, an iPhone
 Mini or a possible budget iPhone.

The writer claimed the source of the 
images, whose identity he chose to keep secret, told him the 5S is set 
for launch between March and July, while the iPhone 6 will be unveiled 
at the year's end.
