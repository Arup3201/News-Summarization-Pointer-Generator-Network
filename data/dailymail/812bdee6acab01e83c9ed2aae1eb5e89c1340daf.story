Hundreds of British suspected paedophiles have still not been arrested despite being named by Canadian police 18 months ago.

Canadian detectives say they sent police ‘hundreds of names’ of people who viewed ‘horrific’ child abuse videos distributed from Toronto by a crime ring.

Globally, 348 arrests have been made and 386 children rescued.

But yesterday it emerged not one person was arrested in the UK despite their details being handed to the Child Exploitation and Online Protection centre, which tracks paedophiles.

Experts said that police are struggling to cope with the sheer number of people suspected of viewing child abuse online.

This year the Daily Mail revealed only one in 15 people caught viewing such images is arrested.

John Carr, an expert in fighting online abuse, said the news was ‘sad but not surprising’.

‘We are going to have to find new and better ways of dealing with this type of crime,’ he said.

Canada’s Operation Spade started in 2010 and has worked with Interpol in more than 50 countries. More than 350,000 images and 9,000 videos of child sexual abuse have been found.

A spokesman for the National Crime Agency, which runs Ceop, said it is ‘using the Toronto information for intelligence purposes and continues to develop it.’
