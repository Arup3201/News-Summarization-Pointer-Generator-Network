Investigators are trying to positively identify a
 body discovered burned beyond recognition last week in a charred Range Rover
 near a luxury hotel on the north shore of this Caribbean island.

Officials
 released scant details at a news conference, but speculation was rife 
that the dead man was wealthy hotelier Oliver Gobat, a St. Lucia native 
who also has British citizenship.

He was reported missing Friday, the same day the body was found near his family's upscale Cap Maison hotel and spa.

Inferno: Police forensic officers examine the shell of the car in which it is believed that hotelier Oliver 'Ollie' Gobat's charred remains were found in St Lucia

Multimillionaire Oliver Gobat, 38, was allegedly shot twice in the head before being doused with petrol and set alight in his Range Rover, pictured, on the Caribbean Island of St Lucia

Tourism
 Minister Lorne Theophilus said only that the body was believed to be a 'prominent St. Lucian resident associated with the tourism sector.'

On Wednesday, Gobat's family issued a 
statement saying they were devastated by his 'sudden and tragic death.' 
They said he died Friday and they planned to hold a memorial service 
Saturday.

However, Assistant Police Commissioner Frances 
Henry said officials were still trying to determine the identity and 
were working on getting forensic assistance from overseas.

A police statement Tuesday said the body's identity could not be conclusively determined 'in the absence of scientific evidence.'

An
 initial autopsy found evidence of head trauma and possible gunshot 
wounds, according to police. But they said the body was so badly burned 
it  would require further work to determine the cause of death.

A charred body was found in a burnt-out car on the Cap Estate, an exclusive resort area on the island, hours after Gboat's family, who run a five-star boutique hotel on the island, reported him missing.

Reports suggested the victim had been shot twice in the head before being doused with gasoline and set alight.

The family have confirmed there will be a memorial service for the hotelier in Caribbean and UK

In a statement, his family said:
 'The Gobat family are devastated by the sudden and tragic death of 
their son and brother Oliver on Friday April 25 in St Lucia, the island 
where he was born and which he loved.

'We
 have been overwhelmed by the outpouring of messages and love but we do 
need to grieve and we would ask for privacy at this time.

'There
 will be a celebration of the life of Oliver Gobat held in St Lucia for
 family and friends this Saturday, May 3, from 5pm and a memorial will 
be held in the UK in the near future with dates and details to follow.'

Though Mr Gobat was born in St Lucia, he held joint British and Caribbean nationality.

After Mr Gobat's death, double Olympic decathlon champion Daley Thompson tweeted his condolences.

He
 said: 'My love and thoughts go out to friends and family of Ollie 
Gobat. He was a gem and his family must have been so proud of him. RIP 
my friend. X'

BBC sports pundit and Olympic heptathlon gold medallist Denise Lewis also tweeted her condolences.

She
 said: 'Just read the shocking news about the death of Oliver Gobat. So 
very sad. My condolences to his friends and family. Such a lovely guy.'

On Tuesday, horrific pictures emerged showing the burnt-out wreckage of a Range Rover in which local police officers found a body, thought to be that of Mr Gobat.

The charred remains were discovered hours 
after his family - who run a $685-a-night five star boutique hotel - 
reported him missing.

The 38-year-old's death remains a mystery as police have been unable to give details until a post mortem examination is complete

The athlete tweeted this heart-felt message to Mr Gobat's family

Olympian Daley Thompson, who has carried out fitness workshops at the Gobat family’s luxurious Cap Maison hotel on the island, paid tribute to the hotelier on Twitter.

He
 wrote: 'My love&thoughts go out to friends&family of Ollie 
Gobat. he was a gem& his family must have been so proud of him. RIP 
my friend. X’

Unconfirmed 
reports from St Lucia suggest Mr Gobat’s family lodged a ‘missing 
person’ report with police after he failed to return home on Friday 
night.

Athlete Daley Thompson who knew the Gobat family today tweeted: 'My love&thoughts go out to friends&family of Ollie Gobat. he was a gem& his family must have been so proud of him. RIP my friend. X

The vehicle he owns matches the description of the Range Rover which was discovered with the body inside around 9pm last Friday.

The
 body of the prominent island businessman, in his late thirties, was 
said to have been ‘burnt beyond recognition’ and was found in the front 
passenger seat.

The FCO is working with island authorities to help identify the body after news emerged of the death.

An FCO spokesperson said: 'We are aware of reports and are looking into them urgently.'

A spokesman for St Lucia police said: 'We can’t disclose any information at the moment, we are meeting with the family soon.'

Cap
 Maison, a five-star boutique hotel set in the lush tropical grounds of a
 former sugar plantation on the northern tip of the island, offers 
luxury suites.

Guests, which have included Amy Winehouse and Kelly Brook, stay in colonial-style villas and every luxury is on tap, including valets, private chefs, a walk-in wine cellar and spa.

The creators of the hotel were the Gobat family, Theo and Helen and their three sons Rufus, Adam and Oliver.

The dead man’s parents, who live in Esher, Surrey, are understood to have flown out to St Lucia.

Theo Gobat, 74, was born in Chester and trained as an accountant and moved to St Lucia in 1974 as finance director of a hotel and travel company which then went bankrupt.

He and another director successfully took over the company’s hotels and eventually created the small, upmarket Cap Maison.

Oliver was born in St Lucia but had dual 
nationality. He represented Surrey juniors at cricket and attended Leeds
 University, before moving to Australia to help launch a health and 
fitness club in Adelaide, Australia.

Mr Garner's death comes three after Roger Pratt, 62, was murdered and his wife Margaret, 60, injured when robbers attacked their yacht as it lay moored off the Caribbean island of St Lucia.

The couple, from Warwickshire, had been on a dream voyage around the world on their £200,000 yacht, when they were ambushed at the port of Vieux Fort, at night.

Four men have been charged with Mr Pratt's murder.
