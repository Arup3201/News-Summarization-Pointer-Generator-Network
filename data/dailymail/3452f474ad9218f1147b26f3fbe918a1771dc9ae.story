UFC superstar Jon Jones is undergoing treatment in a drug facility after testing positive for cocaine metabolites.

The light-heavyweight champion, who defended his title against Daniel Cormier on Saturday, failed a drug test on December 4.

He tested positive for benzoylecgonine in the out-of-competition test but the substance is not on the banned list. Jones past a similar test a week later.

Jones, 27, is considered the best pound-for-pound MMA fighter in the world and has defended his belt eight times.

He was previously arrested in May 2012, charged with driving under the influence and fined $1,000.

The UFC said in a statement: 'We support UFC light heavyweight champion Jon Jones' decision to enter a drug treatment facility to address his recent issue.

'While we are disappointed in the failed test, we applaud him for making this decision to enter a drug treatment facility. Jon is a strong, courageous fighter inside the Octagon, and we expect him to fight this issue with the same poise and diligence.

'We commend him on his decision, and look forward to him emerging from this program a better man as a result.'

UFC president Dana White claims he is proud that Jones has sought out treatment

President Dana White added: 'I am proud of Jon Jones for making the decision to enter a drug treatment facility. 'I'm confident that he'll emerge from this program like the champion he truly is.'

Jones was expected to face his toughest test to date against Cormier but after a tricky second round, dominated thereafter.

And Cormier told MMAFighting.com: 'I am aware of Jon's test and if there is anything to say it is this: there are a lot of people you impact, so please let's get it together. Good luck on your rehab!'
