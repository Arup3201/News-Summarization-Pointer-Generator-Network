A father threatened to kill his neighbour and spewed a string of foul-mouthed abuse at councillors after having a planning application refused.

Brett Palin, 49, launched the tirade after he was informed that councillors had turned down a retrospective planning application for changes to an extension at his Heywood home.

Bury Magistrates were told the ‘red mist’ descended on father of three Palin and he threw a table across the room before running to councillors before showering them with expletives. He is said to have threatened neighbour Adel Dawe, telling her 'You are f****** dead. I’ll f****** kill you.'

Mrs Dawe said: 'The speech was peppered with swearing. Every other word was effing and jeffing. You couldn’t put a pin between swearwords.'

Allen Brett, who was sitting on the committee, said: 'It was a bit surreal. In 20 years of sitting on the council this is the first time I’ve had an incident like this. I was completely appalled by his behaviour.'

However, Palin, who has lived at the house for 10 years, denied threatening anyone and said it was ‘ridiculous’ so much had been made of the incident.

Palin and his partner Angela Keith, 39, have been involved in a dispute with his neighbours and the council planning department since 2009 after a two-storey extension was built at his home.

In 2010, he decided to change the layout of the extension and alter a window - which required retrospective planning permission.

But when the application went before the licensing and regulatory committee, the court heard that councillors also asked Palin to reduce the size of an existing balcony.

When he refused they moved to reject planning permission - and that’s when Palin is said to have flown into a rage.

Magistrates heard a 'red mist' descended on Palin when retrospective planning permission for changes to an extension at his Heywood home were denied at a town hall meeting in February

Palin, who runs a taxi business, admitted swearing out of frustration at the request.

But he said: 'All this over a window, it’s absolutely ridiculous. It’s a shame it’s gone this far because we used to be good friends with our neighbours.

'For the whole of the meeting we were calm and made our points. I may have sworn a couple of times at the end out of frustration, but I didn’t threaten anyone.

'We just feel victimised. I went to a football match with my son a few months ago and people there were swearing for 90 minutes solid and no one was arrested.'

Palin was found guilty of using threatening, abusive or insulting words or behaviour to cause harassment, alarm or distress .

He was fined £180 and ordered to pay £320 costs. Miss Keith, was found not guilty of using threatening, abusive or insulting words or behaviour.

Mrs Dawe could not be contacted for a comment.
