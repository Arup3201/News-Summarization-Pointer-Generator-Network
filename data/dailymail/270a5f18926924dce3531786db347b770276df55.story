A teenager is set to be one of the youngest pilots ever to fly passengers on a major airline after he was offered at job with Ryanair at the age of just 19.

Ryan Irwin, from Wirral, Merseyside, was offered a job with the budget carrier after qualifying as a pilot from the prestigious Oxford Aviation Academy.

After he completes his training with Ryanair in September, he will fulfil a life-long dream when he finally sits at the controls in the cockpit of an international commercial passenger jet.

A real high flyer: Ryan Irwin outside the Oxford Aviation Academy. At just 19 years old he is set to become one of the youngest ever commercial airline pilots after he was offered a job with budget carrier Ryanair

The sky is now quite literally the limit for the youngster, who said he is thrilled by the prospect of lying passengers to more than a thousand holiday destinations in Europe.

'It sounds clich√©d but it's what I've wanted to do ever since I can remember, as young as four or five,' said Mr Irwin, a former pupil of Wirral Grammar School.

'I had model planes and pestered my parents to take me to the viewing lounge at Manchester Airport.'

After qualifying from the pilot training academy in Oxford in February Mr Irwin applied for jobs straight away and soon received offers from both Ryanair and Jet2, another budget airline.

'To have the cockpit of a jet as your office is pretty exciting': A Ryanair plane takes off from Barcelona, Spain, one of more than a thousand destinations that Mr Irwin's new job could take him too

'We were told it can take a while to get a job after graduating, so to have two job offers when you aren't expecting one was a surprise,' he said.

'Ryanair got back to me first, it was a no brainer really.

'The most exciting part will be flying a jet for the first time, and to have the cockpit of a jet as your office everyday is pretty exciting.

'It will be interesting to see what people think about my age.'
