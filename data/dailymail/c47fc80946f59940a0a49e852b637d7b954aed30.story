A much-loved local radio talk show host who was known for her activism on veterans' issues has been found shot dead in her home near the Jersey shore.

The bullet-riddled body of April Kauffman was found at around 11:30 a.m. on Thursday by a hosue worker who called 911, according to Atlantic County Prosecutor Ted Housel.

Housel said the 47-year-old had been shot numerous times in the bedroom of her home in Linwood, about 12 miles from Atlantic City.

Murdered: April Kauffman had been shot numerous times in the bedroom of her home in Linwood, about 12 miles from Atlantic City

Well-known: Kauffman hosted a weekly talk radio program on WOND, where she advocated for veterans causes and other issues

Neighbours told CBS that they 
witnessed Kauffman's distressed husband, Dr. James Kauffman, arriving at 
the murder scene yesterday, saying his wife was asleep with a pillow over her face when he went to 
work early that morning.

Neighbour Lou Tate told ABC that the endocrinologist spoke briefly to his wife and kept asking, 'Why now?'

'I think he's getting ready to retire,' Tate told the station. 'They bought a home in Arizona, and I think they wanted to relocate possibly.'

Kauffman, a grandmother, hosted a weekly talk radio program on WOND, where she advocated for veterans causes and other issues.

Harry Hurley, who did several radio broadcasts with Kauffman, told The Press of Atlantic City that she ‘did the work of 100 people.’

He was shocked that somebody who did so much to help other people could be murdered so viciously.

'I can't think of anybody that would 
want to do harm to April because all she ever did was help people and 
she didn't do it in a way that she could have garnered any enemies,' Hurley told CBS.

US Senator Robert Menendez (D-NJ) added to the network: 'Quite simply,
 April was a patriot in every sense of the word and her tireless work on
 behalf of those who served made a real difference in the lives of 
many.'

The tireless activist had recently been 
awarded the New Jersey Governor's Jefferson Award for her outstanding 
contribution to the community, according to the Press of Atlantic City.

Police tape remained cordoned around the couple's home today as detectives continued to scour the area for clues.

A neighbour who did not want to be identified told the South Jersey News that the Kauffmans kept an arsenal of weapons in a vault in their basement.

Linwood police chief Robert James confirmed to the Press of Atlantic City that the family owned guns, but would not comment on weather any of them were used in the murder.

Tributes have started pouring in for 
Kauffman, who also owned a salon and catering company, and was 
well-known - and loved - in the community.

Leslie Potts wrote on Facebook: 'There wasn’t too much I liked about living in New Jersey, but when I first moved there, not knowing a soul, a lady named April Christine Kauffman became one of my very first friends. She took me in and made me feel like part of her family.

R.I.P April. I will never forget ALL the wonderful things you’ve done for me.'

Another person named Katie Fleming Frassinelli added: 'It’s because of April’s tireless efforts that we now offer Wounded Warrior events at the National Corvette Museum.

'April - you will be sorely missed. We know that you are still providing comfort to those troops that have been lost and are now in heaven. Know that your legacy will continue to live on at the Museum with our Wounded Warrior program!'

The prosecutor's office and the Linwood Police Department are investigating. No arrests have been made.
