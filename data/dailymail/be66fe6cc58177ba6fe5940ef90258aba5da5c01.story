Real Madrid skipper Iker Casillas and vice-captain Sergio Ramos were left unimpressed by a number of first-team players' decision to go out and celebrate Cristiano Ronaldo's 30th birthday just hours after Saturday's heavy defeat to rivals Atletico, according to Marca.

The general feeling among the squad after seeing pictures of the gathering was that the party was inappropriate so soon after the 4-0 defeat at the Vicente Calderon.

Ronaldo was reportedly joined by close friends Pepe, Marcelo and Fabio Coentrao as well as James Rodriguez, Luka Modric, Sami Khedira and Keylor Navas at the party. Assistant managers Paul Clement and Fernando Hierro were also said to be in attendance.

However, Casillas and Ramos decided against attending and it is expected players will demand an explanation from Ronaldo and Co.

It is believed several first-teamers were also angered by the player's willingness to sing on stage and pose for pictures.

Meanwhile, Ronaldo's agent Jorge Mendes has insisted the player was far from in the party spirit.

After a video showing Ronaldo enjoying his birthday celebrations appeared in the Spanish media, Mendes told Spanish radio station Cadena Ser: 'He (Ronaldo) was very angry. Any player that loses a game and more so, Ronaldo, who is a great professional, who continues to be the best professional in the world, would be angry.

Ronaldo's agent Jorge Mendes defended the Ballon d'Or winners decision to go ahead with the party 

'The fact is that his birthday party had been organised more than a month ago and he had family coming from abroad.

'He didn't want to cancel out of respect for the people that came.

'What is inadmissible is that somebody takes advantage of a private affair to release a video.

'Ronaldo was devastated after the defeat and people spent two hours trying to cheer him up.' 

Ronaldo was crowned World Player of the Year last month for the third time in his career, and the Portugal international has enjoyed an impressive campaign so far. 

The former Manchester United star has scored 28 goals and set up nine more in 19 league appearances to help Real lead the Primera Division standings.

'It's very difficult to be Cristiano, honestly,' Mendes said. 'In life, there are good times and times when things don't go as well.

'The problem is that Cristiano has accustomed people badly because 99 per cent of the times he does extremely well.

'He decides games, he does everything.

'But when he goes through a spell when things don't go as well, people should stand behind him because we are talking about the best player in the world.

'He is a human being.

'I'm very calm because he is the best professional.

'Cristiano throughout these years has been an example to everyone and will continue to be.

'Cristiano will solve the situation as he always does.'

Real, who are one point clear of Barcelona at the top of the table, host Deportivo La Coruna on Saturday. 

Mendes said Ronaldo was 'devastated after the defeat and people spent two hours trying to cheer him up.'
