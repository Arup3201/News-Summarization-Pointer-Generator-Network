A private college at the centre of a row over bogus students has had its licence to recruit from overseas suspended by the Home Office.

St Patrick’s College in London is being investigated after its publicly funded student numbers ballooned from zero to 4,000 in just one year.

The students received £95.7 million in loans and grants in 2013-2014 – more than any other private college in the UK.

It was one of a number of institutions examined by the Commons public accounts committee, which this week criticised ministers for wasting taxpayers’ money on loans to students attending colleges run by private companies or charitable institutions.

The committee found more than £3 million had been paid to EU students attending British colleges who could not prove their eligibility through residency status.

Other foreign students who were given funding failed to attend courses, did not complete them or could not speak the required level of English.

Margaret Hodge, committee chair, said there had not been sufficient regulation of providers to protect public money.

These ‘alternative providers’ have greatly expanded over the past four years, with 53,000 students claiming financial support in 2013/14 compared with 7,000 in 2010/11.

The Home Office suspended St Patrick’s licence to recruit overseas students as investigators examine whether many were wrongly admitted.

Holborn-based St Patrick’s, the UK’s largest private college, is being investigated by the Department for Business and the Quality Assurance Agency.

Daniel Khan, St Patricks’ principal, said that the premises ‘are of high quality’ and that the Department for Business ‘has said that it needs to be satisfied that designation of the premises will not adversely affect the operations or processes of the college.’

He told Times Higher Education: ‘I can only imagine that this is the “investigation” you are referring to.’

Sally Hunt, general secretary of the University and College Union, said: ‘The Government allowed private companies, that lack transparency and accountability, to profit from public subsidies without the most basic checks, and this is the completely inevitable result.’
