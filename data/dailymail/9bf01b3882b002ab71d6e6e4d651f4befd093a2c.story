An Egyptian student dressed as an imam in Italy and walked the streets carrying a copy of the Koran - and recorded the vile torrent of abuse he received.

Hamdy Mahisen decided to conduct the social experiment to test how tolerant the people of Milan are of Muslims.

He walked for five hours dressed in white robes and cap typically worn by religious leaders and Muslim men.

The 30-year-old is seen attracting astonished stares – and insults are hurled at him, including ‘Taliban!’

Numerous references to terrorism are made, including one person who says ‘S*** have you seen the ISIS’, while another person remarks: ‘Imagine if he has a gun under his tunic’.

The clip comes amid escalating tensions between Italians and the country’s Muslim population following terror attacks in Paris and Copenhagen.

It has been reported that Islamic State could soon bring terror to the European shores and militants have already taken coastal towns in Libra just a few hundred miles south of Italy. 

Mr Mahisen, who speaks fluent Italian and lives in the city with his parents, told La Repubblica that his appearance would not have attracted the same attention in New York or Paris. 

But his video comes days after a Jewish journalist conducted a similar experiment in Paris to highlight anti-Semitism in the French capital.

Earlier this week, Zvika Klein, a reporter for Jewish news outlet NRG, silently walked in various parts of Paris for ten hours wearing a kippah (skullcap) and a tzitzit (knotted ritual tassels).

And his hidden camera footage revealed an ugly side of the French capital as he is seen harassed and intimidated.

As he wanders around neighbourhoods wearing the garments associated with his Jewish faith, he is spat at, threatened and even called a 'dog'.

After the attack on a kosher supermarket in Paris last month, where four Jews were murdered for their faith, Mr Klein decided to record what life is really like for a Jew living in Paris.

His video went viral earlier this week and has now attracted more than four million views on YouTube. 

He found tourist attractions were 'relatively calm' - but in other areas he received 'hateful stares and belligerent remarks.'
