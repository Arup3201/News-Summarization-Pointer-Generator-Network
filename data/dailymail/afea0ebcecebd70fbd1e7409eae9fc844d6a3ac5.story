Paedophiles, violent thugs and drug dealers were among more than 4,000 offenders who applied to become teachers last year despite having almost 10,000 criminal convictions between them.

Criminal records checks revealed four convictions for child sex offences, including one for a sex attack on a girl under 13, as well as three convictions for assaulting or neglecting a child.

The Criminal Records Bureau said that, to date, checks had helped to stop more than 130,000 unsuitable people from working with children.

The figures, released under the Freedom of Information Act, revealed that the 263,477 checks carried out on applicants for teaching posts in 2011 identified 4,098 with 9,493 convictions between them.

These included more than 50 sex offences, 11 for arson, and two for making threats to kill.

Some 830 violent offences were highlighted overall, along with more than 550 drugs offences and 11 for causing death by reckless driving.

Separate figures showed that sex offenders and hundreds of violent criminals applied to work in nurseries last year.

Siobhan Freegard, co-founder of parenting website Netmums, said: ‘Parents will be appalled at these figures.

‘Being a schoolteacher or a nursery 
worker is a position of huge responsibility as you are shaping 
youngsters' characters and lives.

‘It's shocking that thousands of offenders are applying to work with 
children when they have convictions for child sex attacks, violence and 
drugs.

Shocked: Netmums founder Siobhan Freegard said child welfare comes before offenders getting a second chance

‘While it is right ex-offenders are given every opportunity to get into 
employment and build new lives, most parents wouldn't want someone 
convicted of a sexual, violent or other serious offence having 
responsibility for their child in the classroom.

‘Children's welfare must come first.’

But Brian Lightman, general secretary of the Association of School and College Leaders, said it was ‘encouraging that the CRB system is picking up these issues’.

A CRB spokesman said: ‘Criminal records checks have helped to stop at least 130,000 unsuitable people from working or volunteering with children or vulnerable people.

‘Good recruitment practices, such as thorough reference checking, are a key responsibility for all employers, especially those working with children and vulnerable groups.

‘Criminal records checks are just one of a range of tools to help employers make the right recruitment decisions.

‘Not only is it an offence to knowingly employ a person barred by the Independent Safeguarding Authority, but it is also an offence for a barred person to work or even apply to work with the vulnerable group from which they have been barred.’
