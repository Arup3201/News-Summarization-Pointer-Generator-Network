A father and son were almost crushed to death by an industrial pipe after it fell on their car while they were driving.

Brian Smith had to be cut out of the vehicle but ended up with relatively minor injuries, while his seven-year-old son, also called Brian, was completely unhurt.

The 45-year-old is now recovering at his home in Cumbernauld, in central Scotland, and says he is lucky to be alive following the accident last Friday.

Destruction: A father and son escaped serious injury when a huge pipe fell on their Vauxhall Corsa

Escape: Brian Smith and his son, also called Brian, at home in Cumbernauld after their accident

He was driving his son to a swimming class in the town when the pipe fell onto his Vauxhall Corsa, crushing the roof completely.

The overhead pipe was apparently knocked loose by a lorry, and may have been damaged in the storms that hit Britain last week.

'It was terrifying,' Mr Smith said. 'We were driving along normally when all of a sudden there was this enormous bang, like a bomb going off.

'Everything went white as the windscreen exploded. I was stunned.

'My first thought was for wee Brian. I turned to him in a panic - he was sitting there without a scratch on him. I couldn't believe it.'

Members of the public rushed to their aid and helped to ensure that the seven-year-old was able to walk away from the accident unharmed.

Mr Smith, a chef, added: 'People were amazing. There was a first-aider in particular I want to thank - I don't know his name.

'He was at my side in an instant, he kept me talking, kept me awake.

'He also contacted the emergency services and my family. I'm so grateful.'

Praise: Mr Smith, a chef, thanked bystanders for rushing to help him and his son

Firefighters had to cut the father from his car, before he was rushed to hospital with injuries to his head, neck, chest and hands.

Surrounding roads were closed for 12 hours to ensure that there was no danger for other motorists.

A spokesman for the Scottish Fire and Rescue Service said: 'Thankfully no-one was seriously hurt in this incident - it was clearly a lucky escape.'
