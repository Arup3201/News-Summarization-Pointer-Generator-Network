Psycho killer? Gabriel Campos Martinez was arrested following a two year search for the personal responsible for the slaying of a 66-year-old man whose head and extremities were found in scattered below the Hollywood sign in Los Angeles in 2012

Police said Monday they've solved the shocking murder of a man whose head, feet and hands were found on a trail below the famous Hollywood sign back in 2012.

Two years after a dog on a walk found 66-year-old Hervey Coronado Medellin's head in a plastic bag in Griffith Park, police arrested Gabriel Campos Martinez, 38, in San Antonio, Texas on suspicion of murder on Sunday.

LAPD Chief Charlie Beck revealed that the two men were former roommates and that Martinez was a person of interest in the case, which he called 'particularly grisly' and 'very difficult,' all along.

Beck also thanks local Texas authorities who helped zero in on Martinez, KTLA reports.

Martinez was being held Monday without bail while he awaited extradition proceedings.

Two women discovered Medellin's head while walking dogs on a trail in Griffith Park.

One of the dogs, which was off its leash, had started to play with a plastic bag. When the dog shook the bag, the head fell out.

Grisly: The head and later the hands and feet of Martinez's ex roommate Hervey Coronado Medellin were discovered under the sign after a dog unearthed his head in a plastic bag while walking a trail

More than 120 police officers, firefighters and Los Angeles County sheriff's deputies searched 7 acres of the park during a two-day search that finally uncovered Medellin's (right) hands and feet. A suspect, however, wouldn't be arrested for two years

 than 120 police officers, firefighters and Los Angeles County sheriff's
 deputies searched 7 acres of the park during a two-day search.

Another cadaver dog helped find more body parts, including hands and feet, near the same area where the head was discovered.

Police
 have said they believe the victim was killed elsewhere and his remains 
dumped just inside the park, which attracts hundreds of hikers and dog 
walkers on most days.

Although rustic, it is just a short distance from film studios and other Hollywood attractions.

Medellin
 lived in nearby Hollywood at the time of his death, according to the LA
 Times, and was a retired Mexicana Airlines employee.

Medellin was missing for 9 days before his body parts were recovered on the very trails near his Hollywood home where he'd once walked his own dog. Here, police are pictured in the midst of their search for those body parts back in 2012

He was reported missing by his boyfriend a full nine days before his body was recovered.

Friends
 and family said Medellin loved the outdoors and hiking and that he 
often walked his own dog along the trails where his body parts would 
later be scattered.

The LAPD
 offered a $50,000 reward for information leading to the arrest of the 
person responsible for Medellin's murder after six months had gone by 
with no arrest in the case, though it was unclear if the reward still 
stood at the time of Martinez's arrest.
