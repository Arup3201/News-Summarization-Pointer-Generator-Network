Apple has patented a 'smart pen' that can capture handwriting and drawings and send them to an iPad or iPhone.

The 'Communicating stylus' application outlines a pen that uses accelerometers, wireless communication hardware and onboard storage to transfer hand-written notes and drawings to a tablet. 

The U.S. Patent and Trademark Office drawings, revealed today, show the pen could be used in a meeting to automatically send images to all participant's phones, for instance.

Apple's stylus is based on efficient accelerometers or other motion-sensing hardware. In practice, Apple's pen activates only when picked up, its nib is pressed to paper, withdrawn from a dock or manually turned on by the user. 

From there, onboard sensors track position changes in relation to an initial zero point, allowing the device to send realtime data for translation and graphical representation on an iOS device's screen.

'The technology to build a 'communicating stylus' has long been available should Apple decide to build such a device,' said Apple Insider, which discovered the patent.

'Indeed, most of the hardware mentioned in the patent are already being used in current-generation iPhones and iPads.'

Several companies already sell similar products, most notably Livescribe's 'smartpen,, whch uses an infrared camera located in its tip to capture handwriting.

This is then stored on the pen's own memory, or sent via wifi, although it needs specialized paper.

However, Apple founder Steve Jobs famously despised stylus pens.

'Who wants a stylus?' Jobs said at the 2007 MacWorld conference. 'You have to get 'em, and put 'em away. You lose 'em. Yuck. Nobody wants a stylus.'

Despite this, Apple's filing shows the stylus can be configured to transmit movement data after a certain amount is collected, at predefined intervals or continuously, depending on user need. 

the stylus could be used with different nibs or pen heads to write on different materials

Another option is sending out stylus data to multiple devices, perhaps as meeting notes.

The patent also includes details of how the stylus could be used with different nibs or pen heads to write on different materials, so that it can be used with ink in notebooks, or with graphite for pencil drawings, or with markers for whiteboards.  

Apple's invention can even be fitted with multiple accelerometers to measure movement in three dimensions, thus producing an accurate digital copy of stylus motion at any angle, whether it be on a desk, wall or in the air. 

Apple says users can transmit data to a computing device that remains in their pocket or bag, a seamless solution for saving digital backups of physical notes.

A capacitive version that can be used as a traditional iPad stylus is also mentioned. 

Apple's smart pen patent was first filed for in January 2010 and credits Aleksandar Pance as its inventor.
