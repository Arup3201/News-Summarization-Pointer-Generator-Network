A grieving father wept today as he left tributes to his three young children, who appear to have been killed by their heavily pregnant mother, who then jumped to her own death.

Craig McLelland, 24, clung to his mother Mandy McLelland for support as he left a Winnie the Pooh balloon and a teddy bear outside the flat where the children died in Lowestoft, Suffolk.

He is thought to have split up with Fiona Anderson, 23, shortly before she fell 40ft to her death from a multi-storey car park, where she died at 8am on Monday along with his unborn baby.

Police found the bodies of their children Levina, three, Addy, two, and 11-month-old Kyden around three hours later at her ground floor flat half a mile away in London Road South.

Unemployed Craig and his mother were 
allowed through a cordon of police tape for three minutes to look at 
floral tributes and around 40 cuddly toys and teddy bears left by 
well-wishers.

He refused to speak to reporters as he left, saying: 'Get out of my 
face'. He and Mandy, 44, hugged each other in a nearby car park 
before being driven away.

Mandy who also left flowers at the scene also declined to comment earlier at 
her home in Lowestoft. She would only say: 'I have lost everything - my 
whole family'.

Hours before her death yesterday, his ex Fiona Anderson had posted desperate Facebook messages saying her partner had left her for another woman, along with pictures of their unborn daughter.

The
 23-year-old put up photographs of her three other children with the message: 
‘Mummy will always love you and I’ll never leave you,' adding later: 
'I'll keep them safe'.

But she was found dead at the foot of a car park after apparently throwing herself off.

In her Facebook postings, Miss Anderson issued an emotional plea to Craig McLelland.

‘All we did was love you,’ she wrote. 
‘We never gave up on you. You have hurt us so much for so long. I gave 
you everything I could. Your kids worshipped you like a god.’

Support: Mr McClelland is comforted by a friend as he surveys the growing mountain of tributes

Death: Fiona Anderson also known as Fiona Chisholm, is said to have broken up with her partner before jumping from a car park

Miss Anderson then posted pictures of each of her children and wrote messages about how much she loved them.

‘The most beautiful things I have ever seen. Love you babies so much,’ she wrote.

In a final message she posted a scan 
picture of a baby and wrote that she was due to give birth on June 10 to
 a girl she would call Evalie.

Distraught: The pair had three children together and are believed to have recently split up

The body of the woman was found a short distance from the property where the three dead children were found

Last night, Mr McLelland arrived at Miss Anderson’s home close to the seafront in Lowestoft, Suffolk.

Choking back tears, he said: ‘I have just lost my family. My children are dead. What would you be feeling?

‘I found out this morning when I got a phone call saying somebody had committed suicide and I had a feeling who it was.’

When asked whether he had left Miss 
Anderson for another woman, Mr McLelland, who lives in Lowestoft, broke 
down and declined to comment.

Investigation: An officer guards the doorway to the flat today as forensics scour the rooms inside and messages continue to be left outside

Deaths: Police sealed off this multi-storey car park in Lowestoft after Fiona fell to her death here, which led officers to discover her three children dead at home

Miss Anderson is thought to have fallen 40ft to her death in Gordon Road. Her children were found three hours later.

Police are awaiting the results of 
post-mortem examinations to be carried out by a Home Office pathologist 
at the James Paget Hospital in Gorleston near Great Yarmouth, Norfolk.

Detective Superintendent John 
Brocklebank, of the Norfolk and Suffolk major investigation team, last 
night described the deaths as ‘an awful tragedy’.

He said: ‘We are in the early stages 
of a large investigation to try and work out exactly what has happened. 
It is too early to be able to come up with a definitive explanation and 
we will be keeping an open mind.

‘We are treating the deaths of the 
children as suspicious, but from our initial enquiries we do not believe
 there is any threat to the wider community.

‘Our priorities now are to establish 
the circumstances behind the woman’s death and how it may be related to 
the deaths of the three children.’

Tribute: The mountain of cuddly toys at the property grew as people in the town arrived to pay their respects

Remembrance: A police community support officer joined those laying tributes to the children

The three children's bodies were taken to the James Paget Hospital at Gorleston for post-mortem examinations

Mr Brocklebank said police were 
alerted by a 999 call from a member of the public who found a woman 
lying on the ground beside the car park with serious injuries.

He added: ‘Emergency services 
including ambulances and an air ambulance arrived and they did what they
 could to try and resuscitate her, but unfortunately she was pronounced 
dead at the scene.

‘We managed to identify the lady 
concerned which led us to the address. Police officers gained access at 
11.20am and the bodies of the children were tragically found inside.

‘I don’t want to speculate about how 
they died and where the bodies were in the property. We believe she was 
the mother of the young children.’

Det Sup John Brocklebank described the deaths as 'an awful tragedy'

The property is a basement flat on the corner of Grosvenor Road and London Road South, a short distance from the sea

Miss Anderson’s ground floor flat was cordoned off by police last night while officers searched for clues.

Neighbours and friends were last night
 putting cuddly toys and flowers on a makeshift shrine outside the flat 
in a mark of respect.

Karleigh Burlingham, 20, who lives nearby, said: ‘She was a lovely person.

‘She just didn’t seem the sort of mother to do this. It is devastating that three innocent little children have died.

Plunge: The town centre car park the woman is believed to have fallen from

The car park is less than a mile away from the flat where the woman's children were found dead

‘I knew her for three or four years and I thought she was a brilliant mother.

‘Her kids were healthy and well 
brought up. Fiona was outgoing and friendly. She would talk to anyone 
and she was very laid back.

‘But her boyfriend left her about a 
month or so ago for someone else. She was heavily pregnant with a baby 
girl due next month.’

Probe: Police say the investigation is in preliminary stages and have not formally identified the woman or the children

The deaths of the children are being treated as 
suspicious but police say they believe there is 'no threat to the wider 
community'
