Oscar Pistorius will not be allowed to compete in Paralympic sport until 2019 after he was sentenced to a maximum of five years in jail for the manslaughter of his girlfriend Reeva Steenkamp.

Although Pistorius could be released from prison after 10 to 20 months to go under house arrest for the remainder of his punishment, the International Paralympic Committee told Sportsmail that he will not be welcomed back as soon as that.

Craig Spence, spokesman for the IPC, said: ‘It’s five years. 2019 is where we stand on it.

‘The only way he could compete earlier is if he or his team appealed and got a lesser sentence.’

Pistorius is 27, meaning he will not be free to compete until the age of 32.

The IPC had previously indicated that Pistorius could run again despite the manslaughter verdict. But it remains to be seen whether his fitness levels will allow him to start over again in his thirties.

His hopes to run at the 2016 Olympic and Paralympic Games in Rio are at present dashed.

The International Olympic Committee were more equivocal about Pistorius being allowed to compete against able-bodied athletes in Rio in 2016 or Tokyo four years later.

‘We take note of the court’s decision,’ said IOC spokesman Mark Adams. ‘This is a human tragedy for the family of Reeva Steenkamp and also for Oscar Pistorius. We hope very much that time will bring comfort to all those concerned but at this stage we have no further comment to make.’

Pistorius’ selection would first need to be ratified by the IAAF – athletics’ world governing body – before reaching the IOC.
