A 29 -year-old man is in a critical condition after being shot in the head and arm by police at a property in Brisbane.

The man was shot on Priestdale Road at Rochedale South on Tuesday morning after two patrol officers were called to the property to investigate a stolen ride-on mower.

Police have confirmed that the officers were 'confronted' by the man who was driving a four-wheel-drive, and  towing a mower on a trailer, when the officers opened fire.

It has been reported that the man was shot once in the head and four times in the arm, however police have not confirmed the extent of his injuries other than to say he was in a critical condition at Princess Alexandria hospital in Brisbane.

A male passenger was in the car at the time of the shooting, but was not injured in the shooting and is currently in police custody.
