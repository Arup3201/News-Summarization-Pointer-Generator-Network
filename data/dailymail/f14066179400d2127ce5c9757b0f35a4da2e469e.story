A premature baby who surprised his parents when he was born 11 weeks during a holiday in New York has finally arrived to his home in the UK.

Tiny baby Dax Johnston spent six weeks in the Big Apple after he was born weighing just 3lbs to Lee Johnston, 30, and Katie Amos, 30 who were on a four-day 'trip of a lifetime'.

The anxious new parents had to wait for the all clear before they could fly their premature son home after the surprise delivery. But it was another week of careful monitoring at a British hospital before they could finally take Dax back to the family home.

Premature baby Dax Johnston is finally home in Burgh-Le-Marsh with parents Lee Johnston and Katie Amos-  seven weeks after his surprise birth in the Big Apple

Mother Katie was ecstatic to finally be settling back in at Burgh-Le-Marsh,in Lincolnshire, with their son.

She said: 'This is the day we have been hoping and praying for since the very beginning.

'It's a huge relief to have Dax home, I can't believe how quickly he's come on in just one week - we couldn't be more proud. He now weighs over 6lbs so he's practically doubled in size.

'I feel mentally and physically exhausted so it will be great to sleep in our own bed and get Dax into a routine.

'A few weeks ago we never dreamt we would have him home so soon, it seemed like a lifetime away.

The ecstatic parents were delighted to bring their little boy home from Pilgrim Hospital in Boston, Lincolnshire (pictured) where his feeds and weight have been closely monitored after arriving from the US

New mother Katie said she loved New York but admitted she would not be travelling there again if pregnant in the future after the debacle

Tiny baby Dax was just 3lbs when he was born to his British parents during their four-day trip of a lifetime in New York

'The doctors in New York had originally said the earliest we could leave was on March 10th which was Dax's due date so it really is a miracle.

'Both hospitals in the UK and the US have been incredible and really supportive – we couldn't have asked for better care.

'Now we can finally see him in his nursery which has been ready since before we left for New York.'

The couple, who are both personal trainers, had saved for years for their dream city break to the US but never banked on having their child there.

Katie said: 'New York has become a very special place to us and we can't wait to take Dax in the future. We feel like we have an American family now, we met so many kind and helpful people whilst we were there.

'The Ronald McDonald House, who helped us with our accommodation, went above and beyond and even threw me a baby shower – it was really emotional when we said out goodbyes.

Katie said it was a huge relief to finally have her son home who has almost doubled in weight since he was born 11 weeks premature

After spending the first six weeks of his life as an American citizen, Dax was flown back to the UK via private jet and has now been allowed to come home for the first time

Katie and Lee had been sightseeing at Central Park when Katie unexpectedly went into labour- almost three months early

'I definitely want more children in the future but as much as I love New York, I've learnt my lesson and won't be travelling there again whilst I'm pregnant.'

Katie and Lee had been sightseeing at Central Park when Katie unexpectedly went into labour- almost three months early. 

Not only did they have the early arrival of their son to contend with, but the hospital initially refused to accept their medical insurance, leaving them with a staggering $130,000 medical bill.

Katie said: 'We were beside ourselves with worry, but we had to focus on Dax. When he was born he was so tiny and weighed just 3lbs, he needed all of our attention.

'Luckily around a week later our insurers, Allianz, re-opened after the holidays and confirmed we were covered.

'Dax was a fighter from the beginning though and didn't need any lifesaving operations.

'He had a bit of reflux which is normal and Patent Ductus Arteriosus (PDA), but they are quite common in premature babies so nothing too serious thankfully. 

When Dax arrived early his parents had further concern after the hospital initially refused to accept their medical insurance, leaving them with a staggering $130,000 medical bill

Despite being born almost three months before he was due, 'fighter' Dax didn't need any lifesaving operations and has already doubled in weight since the birth

'The next problem was getting Dax a passport, we just wanted to get him home so we went for an American one as this was considerably faster.

'When we had it in our own hands it was a huge milestone then we just needed the okay for him to fly.'

Fortunately for the family they were able to fly home over a month early thanks to having their own private jet.

They were given the all clear by Lenox Hospital in New York on the Thursday evening and arrived back in the UK two days later.

At Pilgrim Hospital in Boston, Lincolnshire,  his feeds and weight were monitored for a week before he was finally allowed home.

Katie said: 'We only had a short window to get Dax home as Pilgrim Hospital had a bed for him but this could change at any minute. From the minute we were told we could leave everything was a blur.

'We had to pack and gather all of our things before being transferred directly to our plane by an ambulance. We landed and took off in total eight times as we had to stop off three times to refuel before we made it back to East Midlands airport.

After the family were given the all clear by Lenox Hospital in New York and secured the youngster a passport, he was flown back to the UK on the couple's private medical jet and has now been released from a UK hospital to see his home for the first time

The couple are now looking forward to showingoff Dax son to their family and friends who are yet to meet him

'It wasn't a private plane like you'd imagine, it was very cramped but it had all the things Dax needed for his big journey home.'

The couple are now looking forward to showing off their son to their family and friends who are yet to meet him.

Lee said: 'It's great having the little man home, we can finally get him into a bit of a routine. We're now organising a big welcome home party for him to thank everyone.

'It's so nice being able to pick clothes from our whole wardrobe again and have all of our home comforts. The thing me and Katie have been looking forward to most is being able to sleep in our bed with Dax by our side.

'He seems to be settling in really well so I've now gone back to work as someone needs to pay the bills.

'We couldn't be happier, Dax is coming on in leaps and bounds and has surpassed all of the doctor's expectations. Our next mission is for Dax to get big enough so we can take him back to meet his new adopted American family.

'We have promised to keep in touch with all of the people who helped him on his journey, and they're all excited for him to go back.'
