A new photo series has given 'diving into marriage' a whole new meaning.

Adam Opris, a photographer in Fort Lauderdale, Florida, captured stunning portraits of brides and grooms underwater.

'I love shooting weddings and I find the magic when a bride is in her gown to be hard to match. I knew I had to bring a bride into the ocean,' Mr Opris told MailOnline.

He went on to explain how he pulled off the impressive project, saying: 'Each person had two safety divers with them providing air and guidance. They moved them into their first position and then we tied weight belts to their legs to help them stay down.'

Mr Opris's love for the ocean led him to become a certified diver and invest in underwater housing equipment for his camera.

'When I tried to figure out how to bring this underwater bridal shoot to life, I realized that I want to work with real people who shared my passion for the ocean and were daring, and willing to trust me,' he said.

A year and a half before he organized the bridal shoot, 25 feet deep off the shores of Key Largo, Florida, he began practicing his underwater shooting skills by photographing his nieces in their swimming pool.

He booked Rainbow Reef Dive Center for the shoot, requesting two safety divers per model, and was told that he'd have six seats on the boat reserved for his photo subjects.

A call for dive-certified participants on Facebook yielded 'an overwhelming response' and he was able to find four women and two men who fit the bill.

'The two couples are really married and love to dive! The other two individual girls are avid divers and ocean lovers as well,' he said.

With no budget for the project, he managed to secure four wedding dresses, two tuxedos, four flower bouquets and shoes through industry connections. 

Mr Opris asked one of his diving instructors to conduct a refresher with his six models so that they could practice breathing without a mask for prolonged periods of time.

Before the shoot, he went over poses with the six participants, using shoulder taps to direct their positioning.

'Once their masks came off, their visibility would drop to nothing,' he said.

'As they achieved a level of comfort with their mask on, they gave away their masks and relied on each other as well as my taps and direction to get the right angles and poses,' he added.

He says that the shoot went off without any problems, despite coping with the challenges of 'visibility, jellyfish and weighing them down properly while keeping them relaxed and comfortable while not being able to see.'

'The pictures came out better than I imagined in my head and we were blessed with an experience and memories that will last forever,' he said.

Mr Opris captured pregnant women underwater for another recent project. 

A little help: 'Each person had two safety divers with them providing air and guidance,' he said

Heavy demand: 'They moved them into their first position and then we tied weight belts to their legs to help them stay down,' he added
