The man who faces champion Michael van Gerwen in the first round of the PDC World Championship on Thursday night knows a thing or two about bringing down giants of darts.

Joe Cullen was just 21 when he stunned Phil Taylor at a tournament in Killarney and recalls: ‘It was a weird game. I didn’t really feel nervous. All of a sudden there were loads of people round the board. I realised I had three darts to beat him. He didn’t get a shot to win. 

'There was a big cheer, the room was more pleased than I was. Phil was gracious, as he always is. But the next time I played him it was my first Pro Tour final and he murdered me, 6-1. He never forgets.’

Now 25, Cullen has been taking the game seriously for a shorter time than Van Gerwen, only quitting his job as a Royal Mail postman four years ago.

He has an uncanny ability when it comes to impersonating rivals. A YouTube clip shows his mimicry of Taylor is as precise as his darts. ‘I can do a few,’ he says. ‘It’s just a laugh!’

He is aware tonight will be tough but is keen to progress beyond the first round for the first time at the fifth attempt. Playing in front of his boy Travis, six, for the first time, he believes he can cause another shock.

‘There is pressure from myself but no one expects me to win,’ he says. ‘But if I play well I’ve got a great chance. I’m definitely going to get chances, taking them is a different thing.’

Sky Sports Darts will show the William Hill World Darts Championship exclusively live — starting today from 7pm.
