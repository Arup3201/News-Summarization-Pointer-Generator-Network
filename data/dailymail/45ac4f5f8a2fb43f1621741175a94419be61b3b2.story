Oklahoma prison officials have changed their execution protocols after they botched the procedure on an inmate how 'writhed and moaned for 43 minutes' before being declared dead. 

Officials have said they will use five-times the dose of sedative midazolam in future executions and reduce the number of media witnesses to the punishment from 12 to five. 

The review followed the execution of Clayton Lockett in April who seemed in considerable distress as the drugs were administered.

The botched execution of Clayton Lockett, left, in Oklahoma in April forced state officials to postpone the punishment of fellow death-row inmate Charles Warner, who was scheduled to die the same night 

Oklahoma has increased the amount of Midazolam, pictured, used in its execution protocols to 500mg

The use of midazolam has been increasingly controversial since EU drug companies refused to export  medicine such as sodium thiopental which was used in lethal injections. 

As a result, states have been forced to experiment with new combinations, such as the addition of midozolam. However, there have been several reports of other 'difficult executions when using the new drug.

In January, Ohio inmate Dennis McGuire 'snorted and gasped' for 26 minutes before dying, while Arizona inmate Joseph Rudolph Wood gasped more than 600 times over almost two hours during his July execution.

According to Jonathan Groner, professor of surgery at Ohio State University College of Medicine, said the use of such a sedative can be problematic. 

He said: 'If you have midazolam he may not respond if he’s uncomfortable.'

A second execution that night was postponed until a review was completed. It has been recommended that prison staff should receive additional training and there should be contingency plans in the event of a problem with the execution equipment or the inmate's medical conditoin. 

An investigation ordered by Governor Mary Fallin conducted by the Department of Public Safety blamed his lengthy death on the poor placement of a single intravenous line in his groin and a decision by the warden to cover the IV site with a sheet. 

The investigation recommended more training for prison staff and a contingency plan, both of which are included in the new procedures.

The director of the Department of Corrections, Robert Patton, declined to comment on the protocol changes, citing ongoing litigation.

Assistant Federal Public Defender Dale Baich, who represents 21 death row inmates who have sued the state Department of Corrections to block their executions, said the new protocols do not solve Oklahoma's execution problems.

Baich said: 'We still do not know what went wrong with Mr. Lockett's execution. Discovery and fact-finding by the federal courts will address those issues.

An intravenous line is inserted into each of the prisoner's arms.

The drugs are injected by hand held syringes simultaneously into the two IV lines. 

Three executioners are used, with one responsible for each of the drugs.  

The condemned criminal is first injected with Midazolam, a strong sedative which causes unconsciousness. 

A second drug, Vecuronium Bromide is used to stop respiration. 

Finally, Potassium Chloride is injected, stopping the prisoner's heart.

'The prisoners still do not have access to information about the source of the drugs, the qualifications of the executioners, or how the state came up with the different drug combinations.'

Under the new guidelines, Oklahoma can continue to administer midazolam, a sedative often given to patients before surgery and commonly known as Versed, as part of three-drug and two-drug protocols. 

It has also been used illegally as a date-rape drug.  

A normal dose in medical settings is usually less than 5 milligrams. Oklahoma's previous protocol called for 100 milligrams. 

The new recommended dosage of 500 milligrams matches that of at least one other state, Florida, which also uses the drug as part of its procedures.

Baich also said cutting the number of media witnesses 'reduces public accountability and makes the process less transparent.'

A federal judge had expressed concern earlier this month that Oklahoma will not be able to implement new guidelines and training for executions before three inmates are scheduled to die this fall.

Charles Warner, who has been set for execution the same night as Lockett, is now scheduled to die on November 13.

Oklahoma has also set execution dates for Richard Glossip on November 20 and for John Marion Grant on December 4. 

Lockett's execution raised new concerns about lethal injection drugs and the secretive process many states use to obtain them. President Barack Obama called the botched execution 'deeply disturbing' and called for a review of how the death penalty is applied in the United States.

The US Supreme Court ruled in 1972 that death by execution was unconstitutional as it was 'a cruel and unusual punishment'. 

Oklahoma passed a new death penalty act in 1977 allowing for execution by lethal injection. 

Between 1915 and 2014 Oklahoma executed 191 men and three women. Eighty-two people were electrocuted, with the last use of the electric chair in 1966. 

The first lethal injection was used to kill Charles Troy Coleman on September 10, 1990. 

Since then 110 people have died by execution. 

One federal prisoner was hanged.
