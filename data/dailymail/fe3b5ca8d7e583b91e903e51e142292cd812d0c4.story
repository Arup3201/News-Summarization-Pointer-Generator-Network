The future's bright: Louis van Gaal talks to his squad in training on Tuesday

VIDEO Team Profile: Netherlands

Not many people could have predicted Holland would beat Spain, let alone dish out a 5-1 thrashing to the world champions. But Louis van Gaal’s team are keeping their feet on the ground.

Captain Robin van Persie, who, with Arjen Robben, became the first Dutch player to score in three different World Cups, said: ‘We shouldn’t get ahead of ourselves — we have a long way to go to win this. This is my fifth (major) tournament and I know how these things work: the euphoria vanishes just as quickly as it appears.’

But the Dutch have every reason to be euphoric. Their new system with three at the back works and allows Robben to play as a striker. With no defensive responsibilities, he can now focus purely on attacking.

Australia fought hard against Chile and were undone by their fluid movement. But they did cause plenty of problems with crosses from deep and set pieces. Expect more of the same on Wednesday.

Van the man: Robin van Persie scored twice as Holland stunned Spain 5-1 on Friday night

One to watch: Arjen Robben

Robin van Persie might have scored a beauty against Spain but it was Arjen Robben’s pace that tore the champions apart. Playing in a forward role, his direct running will terrorise Australia.

Key clash: Matthew Spiranovic vs Robin van Persie

Australia struggled with the pace and strength of Chile’s frontline in their opening game and that could well continue against Louis van Gaal’s side. Van Persie was unplayable at times against the reigning champions Spain and Spiranovic will have to stay disciplined to have any chance of winning his battle with the Manchester United forward.

Familiar face: Tim Cahill

The former Millwall and Everton man has given us a reminder of his power with a header against Chile. He is Australia’s main outlet and they constantly look to whip balls in to him.
