The season isn’t over yet, though the summer may well be. Which is why it feels like an appropriate moment to hand out 10 gongs for events that will linger in the memory – and others that may have been instantly forgotten. Ladies and gents, we give you the Top Spins...

The Ravi Shastri rosette for aptest cliche

Cricket is a game of inches. If Sri Lankan No 11 Nuwan Pradeep had not edged the penultimate ball of the Lord’s Test into his pads, or the final ball just in front of Chris Jordan in the slips; if Shaminda Eranga’s penultimate-ball bouncer to Jimmy Anderson at Headingley had cannoned off his arm-guard rather than his glove – if both these things had happened, England would have kicked off the Test summer with a 1-0 win rather than a 1-0 defeat. 

But they didn’t. Two tiny quirks of fate meant Alastair Cook was under pressure again sooner than anyone thought he would be.

The Joey Barton big-up for lashing out

In his autobiography Ricky Ponting reflects on ‘being in the zone’. Glenn McGrath bowled better, Ponting reckoned, when he wasn’t sledging: ‘If he started to chat to the batsmen, I knew it might be time to give him a spell.’ 

Shane Warne was different: ‘The more he spoke, the more the batsmen seemed to fall into his trap. That was when Warnie was in the zone.’

Just before the Headingley Test, Cook responded with uncharacteristic prickliness to a question about Warne’s incessant commentary-box goading. 

‘Something needs to be done,’ he said, probably realising as he said it that nothing, in fact, could be done at all. And yet who can honestly say they wouldn’t have reacted as Cook did? Inadvisable it may have been, but it was also endearingly human. 

The George Orwell goblet for mystery jargon

MS Dhoni’s repeated insistence that ‘processes’ matter more than ‘results’ seemed designed to infuriate Indian fans – and possibly to defend his ever-more indefensible record as Test captain. 

Yet no one could be quite sure what these processes were, unless they involved capitulation at the first sign of pace and bounce, swing and seam. In which case, we take it all back.

The Norman Tebbit trophy for English conservatism

Not long after Jos Buttler had smashed 121 off 74 balls in a one-dayer against Sri Lanka at Lord’s, confirming he was the most exciting England batsman since Kevin Pietersen’s debut a decade ago, Cook declared he was not ready for Test cricket. Peter Moores backtracked the following day, but the damage had been done.

The timing was impeccable. Not only was Cook regarded by many as part of a grey cabal responsible for axing Pietersen, he was now fuelling the suspicion that he lacked the courage of whatever convictions are needed to captain your country. 

The same goes for Alex Hales’s absurdly belated ascent to the 50-over side. The selectors corrected themselves when Matt Prior disappeared for surgery, but English cricket is still learning to trust the world beyond the textbook.

Exciting: Jos Buttler smashes Sri Lanka all around Lord's - but his Test debut was delayed

The Dogberry certificate for odorous comparisons

As the Test series began against India, the most depressing of all England’s crises appeared to be the impossibility of replacing Graeme Swann. By the time the series was over, we were wondering what all the fuss was about. In four home Tests against India back in 2011, Swann had managed 13 wickets at 40 apiece; in the four in which he bowled this summer, Moeen Ali could boast 19 at 23.

This didn’t suddenly make Moeen a frontliner (his first-class wickets have cost nearly 39 each). But he looked equally adept bowling to right-handers as he did to lefties – something Swann could not always claim. And when his batting returns to the heights of Headingley, England will have an attack-balancing all-rounder on their hands.

There is a case – if a mischievous one – for making Ravindra Jadeja England’s player of the series. Not only did his set-to with Anderson persuade Dhoni to pursue a charge that was as doomed as it was counter-productive, but his dropping of Cook on 15 in the first session at Southampton was the fulcrum on which the entire summer turned.

Eventually, Jadeja was dropped himself, having taken to charging Anderson in a headless bid to deal with late inswing and been exposed for what he is: an athletic and capable limited-overs cricketer who has been encouraged to believe his own hype. Quite what the more substantial Ravichandran Ashwin made of it all is the stuff of caption competitions.

The Mount Everest medallion for solid rocks

After Swann, the player England feared they would miss most was Jonathan Trott, the No 3 who for five years had absorbed the worst that bowlers could hurl at him and laid out the red carpet for the middle order. Yet Gary Ballance had already demonstrated at Sydney that he was more likely than the two other debutants there – Scott Borthwick and Boyd Rankin – to cut the mustard.

Much-needed balance: Gary Ballance has made sure Jonathan Trott is not missed at No 3

In 11 Test innings – one of them unbeaten – Ballance managed 704 runs at 70, scored three hundreds and three fifties, and emitted such unflappability (even, somehow, while falling first ball on the grim fourth evening at Headingley) that Trott could happily be left to his own devices back at Warwickshire. He even had the good sense to treat the coverage of his big night out in Nottingham with a smile and a spot of self-deprecation.

The James Callaghan cookie for best crisis (what crisis?)

Cook looked out of his depth at Headingley and deluded at Lord’s. He was in the grip of a double whammy that had accounted for so many of his predecessors: no runs and no wins. Who knows how different his world would look now if Jadeja had clung on at the Ageas Bowl.

But Cook is stubborn. The next four innings brought him three scores of 70-plus, one of them not out. His senior bowlers woke up. Ian Bell came to life. India retreated shellwards. Three wins do not a Mike Brearley make. 

But many of us – this column included – were calling for his head, and he refused to serve it up. Hats off.

All smiles: Cook's demeanour is in stark contrast to earlier in the summer as England beat India

Gwyneth Paltrow prize for most lachrymose acceptance speech

One or two interpreted Anderson’s tears on the Headingley podium as evidence of a fractured dressing-room. This was curious given that England had just come within two balls of being the first side to bat through the final day of a Test after beginning it five wickets down. If anything, his upset hinted at a unity that had been missing in Australia.

How much did Anderson want the new regime to succeed? A tally of 37 wickets – his best in any summer – at 20 each suggested he was probably up for it.

From tears to cheers: James Anderson was distraught after defeat by Sri Lanka at Headingley but the led England's fightback as they clinched a much-needed series victory against India

Best re-enactment of John Milton’s Paradise Lost

Virat Kohli’s Test average now begins with a three. Six times out of 10 he failed to reach double figures; on the four other occasions, he did not get to 40. In Cheteshwar Pujara’s more selfish moments, he may be quietly grateful for his team-mate’s unearthly decline. If Kohli truly is the heir to Sachin Tendulkar, he could do with a hatful of runs in Australia. (Memo in advance: hundreds at home against West Indies do not count.)

Below average: Virat Kohli struggled in England, failing to reach double figures six times out of 10
