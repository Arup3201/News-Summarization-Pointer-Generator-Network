The square where Ukraine's national crisis began has erupted into violence again as the few hundred remaining protesters clashed with riot police.

Black smoke billowed from burning tyres and activists threw stones in Kiev's Independence Square today as officials tried to remove barricades which had remained since President Viktor Yanukovych was ousted in February.

The violence came as Nato warned Russia could be planning to invade the east of the country as it once again massed 20,000 troops on the border.

Erupting into violence again: Smoke rose once more today from Independence Square in Kiev, the same place which saw the pro-European protests which toppled Ukraine's President Viktor Yanukovych in February

The protestors - who said they were remaining on their barricades to ensure the government did not row back on promises of reform - threw missiles and set alight to heaps of tyres as authorities tried to remove them

All walks of life: Even an Orthodox priest got involved, clashing with the government's Kiev-1 volunteer battalion

Confusion: The riot police and workers eventually withdrew - leaving the situation unresolved in chaotic scenes

Activists - including an Orthodox priest - threw bottles and paving bricks at municipal workers who had been dispatched to dismantle the tents and barricades in the square this morning.

Armed riot police moved onto the square to fight club-waving protesters in combat clothes and masks.

The riot police and workers eventually withdrew - leaving the situation unresolved in chaotic scenes.

The square, known as the Maidan after its name in Ukrainian, was the focus of pro-European protests which ignited Ukraine's political crisis at the end of last year.

Pro-Moscow President Viktor Yanukovych was overthrown and replaced by the more pro-European Petro Poroshenko, largely thanks to the violent protests.

Bloody: There were injuries between the self-defence activists (pictured) and government volunteers

Clashes: The eyes of the world had since shifted from Kiev to pro-Russian rebels in the east of Ukraine

Violence: At one point there were thousands of protesters in the square, but now only a few hundred remain

Historic: The square is in the centre of Kiev and has been crucial to the country's political crisis

But that sparked the anti-Kiev feeling among pro-Russians in eastern Ukraine, spiralling into a civil war and the takeover of cities like Donetsk and Luhansk by militants.

Many protesters, including self-defence militias, had taken down their tents and returned to their homes since Poroshenko was elected in May.

Other barricades remained in place along with makeshift shrines to the 100 or so protesters killed by police sniper fire during the protests.

A few hundred protesters are estimated to still be in the square, saying they wanted to ensure the new government kept its promises of reform.

But Kiev's new authorities said they wanted the city to go back to normal with traffic moving freely ahead of an expected parliamentary election at the end of October.

Anger: The clashes were sparked when city employees tried to clear remaining tents from the square

Yury Kovalchuk, a 43-year-old businessman, complained: 'There are practically no normal people left'

They had already tried to negotiate with the stragglers but all attempts to forge a deal fell through. 

'It's like seeing everything that went on in winter coming back: tyres are burning, the police are here and so are people with clubs,' said Vitaly Lyakh, a 37-year-old Kiev resident.

'It's not right - especially since the most decent people have gone off to fight in the war (against separatists in the east). Civilised countries don't behave like this'.

One protester wearing a Ukrainian cossack uniform, Mykola Bondar, declared his resistance to attempts to take down the encampment.

A group of young masked protesters stood nearby atop a truck, banging on the roof of the vehicle with clubs.

'They tried to kill us today. They set fire to us,' he said.

Improvised: The protesters built up everything they could as their defences, including large outdoor bins

Battle: Kiev's new authorities said they wanted the city to go back to normal with traffic moving freely

Chaos: Just as the clashed happened in Kiev, Russia was mounting troops along the eastern border

But Yury Kovalchuk, a 43-year-old businessman, said: 'It's the right thing to do.

'I was here from the start of the Maidan and I believe it's right now to take down what there is here. There are practically no normal people left here.'

Hundreds of miles away in the east, fighting between Ukrainian forces and pro-Russian rebels has continued - leaving crash investigators unable to attend the scene of the MH17 disaster.

And Russia announced more military exercises near the border this week, prompting a warning from Nato that the Kremlin could be planning a ground invasion.

Nato officials warned Moscow had 20,000 troops near the border who could move into Ukraine under the pretext of launching a humanitarian mission.

Putin has rallied Russians with relentless nationalist campaigns in state media against Ukraine and in support of the rebel cause, and Western officials fear he might invade to prevent a rebel defeat.
