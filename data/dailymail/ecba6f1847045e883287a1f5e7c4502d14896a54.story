A Long Island mansion featured in the 1986 Tom Hanks comedy, The Money Pit - about a couple who buy a property on the cheap which turns into a fixer-upper nightmare - is back on the market for $12.5 million.

Built in 1898, the three-story white clapboard home has eight-bedrooms and is located in Lattingtown, New York.

It has undergone a major renovation in recent years and the current asking price is more than four times what the owners paid just over ten years ago.

‘It’s now the anti-Money Pit,’ listing broker Shawn Elliott of Shawn Elliott Luxury Homes & Estates told the New York Times. ‘The home was restored at the highest quality.’

The 1986 Steven Spielberg comedy featured Hanks and co-star Shelly Long as Walter and Anna, a young couple who foolishly buy a beautiful mansion from a con artist at a ridiculously low price.

Unfortunately the house starts falling apart the moment they move in, with the front door crashing down after Walter carries Anna over the threshold.

A bathtub falls through the floor, then the main stairway collapses and the couple are forced to plough more and more money into the project which Walter dubs ‘the money pit’.

Built in 1898, the three-story white clapboard home is surrounded by a 5.4-acre estate, it has eight-bedrooms and is located in Lattingtown, New York

When the film was shot, the home belonged to Eric Ridder, a publisher and a member of the American yachting team that won the gold medal at the 1952 Olympics.

The front and back of the home were used in the movie, while the inside shots were staged in a studio.

The property last went on the market in 2001 when the asking price was $2.95 million.

The following year, Rich and Christina Makowsky purchased the 5.4-acre estate and found their lives were imitating art.

‘We didn't realize how bad it was. The house was falling apart when you went from room to room. We definitely could have done the sequel,’ Makowsky told the Times.

A crew of 30 spent a year and a half gutting the house, taking down ceilings, ripping out the cast-iron radiators, redoing the plumbing, heating and electrical systems and restoring the home to the splendor of Long Island’s Gilded Age.

The Makowskys makeover has been described 'meticulously designed and decorated with a Versace-esque flair' says the Times.

Each of the seven full and two half-baths was renovated. The pool, pool house, driveway and landscaping, including an outdoor sound system and a six-car garage, were also overhauled.

Three rooms were combined to create a chef’s kitchen, with marble countertops and a mahogany center island.

A nine-foot-long, four-foot-high oval window in the breakfast area overlooks an English rose garden.

The master suite wing includes a sitting room with a fireplace, a dressing room with mirrored French doors on the closets and a master bathroom with a free-standing oval tub.

The four family bedrooms on the second floor have en-suite baths and walk-in closets. The third floor has four additional bedrooms.

The finished lower level has a recreation room, a large gym, a laundry room, a guest or staff suite, a powder room, a pantry and a patio.

A veranda wraps the back of the house and a brick staircase leads to a heated saltwater pool.

An 800-square-foot pool house and is outfitted with a full kitchen, a full bath, a changing room and a laundry room. Also on the manicured three-tiered grounds are a fountain and a gazebo.

The estate is reached through a gated entrance and down a quarter-mile-long rhododendron-lined drive to a white-pebble motor court. The annual property taxes on the home are $65,992.
