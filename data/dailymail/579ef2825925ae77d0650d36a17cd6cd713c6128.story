A Mormon man has taken a smiling selfie for every day he was on a lonely two-year missionary stint because it reminded him to be happy.

Gabriel Guerrero, of Salt Lake City, Utah, said taking a selfie every day while on his Church of Jesus Christ of Latter-day Saints mission was not just a way of recording his experience, but it also kept him smiling when things got tough. 

Mr Guerrero served his mission for LDS in the Washington D.C. North Mission.

Gabriel Guerrero (pictured) said taking a selfie every day while on his Church of Jesus Christ of Latter-day Saints mission was not only a great way to record his experience but kept him smiling when things got tough

He attended the missionary training center in Provo on December 12, 2012 and from day one took a picture of himself every morning.

'I saw a lot of people online doing selfie videos, but I didn't see any missionary ones,' Mr Guerrero told the Deseret News. 

'The funny thing was that I initially was going to not smile as the others had done, but then as I was doing it, I thought to myself, "This is a happy thing! I should be smiling!"'

Mr Guerrero said that although he was initially concerned his companions would think he was behaving oddly, his daily photo became something the other missionaries looked forward to.

He says taking a smiling picture everyday would remind him he was happy - even when things got tough

He would announce to the others that he was about to take his daily photo and they would each try to photobomb it.

When he returned home on December 9, 2014, Mr Guerrero stitched all of the photos together to make a video.

He posted the video on YouTube on January 26 and so far it has had more than 35,000 views.

He now says he is glad he smiled in each of the photos, as it helped him through the tough times during the mission. 

He said: 'Something that I learned during the tough times of my mission was to smile through them.' 

'For the days that did get tough, taking the photo in the morning reminded me that I was happy.'
