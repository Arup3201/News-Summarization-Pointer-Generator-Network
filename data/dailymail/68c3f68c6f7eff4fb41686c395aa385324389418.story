Lionel Messi's public relations firm says a Spanish state prosecutor has agreed to drop the Argentinian footballer from a tax fraud case involving Messi and his father.

The Barcelona forward's father, Jorge Horacio Messi, is apparently still under investigation for an alleged £3.2million in unpaid taxes from Messi's image rights from 2007-09.

Messi's public relations firm confirmed Spanish media reports that the state prosecutor has asked for Messi to be dropped from the investigation that began in June 2013.

Joy: Messi had been accused of £3.2million worth of tax fraud and his father is still under investigation

Curler: Messi is currently at the World Cup with Argentina and scored in their 2-1 win over Bosnia-Herzegovina

Looking up: The Argentine forward can now concentrate on his football and not on the fraud case

The statement reads: '(The prosecutor's request shows) the player was unaware and on the margin of the financial and business structure that his financial advisers had created to manage his income and obligatory fiscal payments.'

The 26-year-old is currently at the World Cup in Brazil playing for Argentina. He scored in the 2-1 win over Bosnia-Herzegovina in their Group F opener.
