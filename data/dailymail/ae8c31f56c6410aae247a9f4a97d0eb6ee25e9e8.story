Alex Oxlade-Chamberlain gave Arsenal fans a pre-season boost as he went through his paces on a treadmill ahead of a return to training on Monday morning. 

The Gunners midfielder missed England’s World Cup games with a knee injury but looks fighting fit for his return to training after a break in Spain.

Oxlade-Chamberlain was seen relaxing with friends on the exclusive Sala Beach in Puerto Banus.

The 
20-year-old has had a frustrating summer after picking up an injury during England's 2-2 draw with Ecuador before the World Cup. 

That
 knee injury and a 
further problem with his groin have led to Oxlade-Chamberlain enduring 
another frustrating summer after being plagued by fitness problems last 
season.

With
 the signing of Alexis Sanchez, competition for places is hotting up at 
the Emirates and Oxlade-Chamberlain will be hoping that he is up to the 
challenge.
