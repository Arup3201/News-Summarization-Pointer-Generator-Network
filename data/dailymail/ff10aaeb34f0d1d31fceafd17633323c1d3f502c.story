Chelsea have paid tribute to Lord Richard Attenborough after the cinema great - and life-long Blues supporter - died at the age of 90 on Sunday.

'Lord A', as the club's official tribute calls Attenborough, was Life President of the Stamford Bridge side - and helped establish Chelsea's reputation as London's glamour club with his high profile support.

The Oscar winning director also helped Chelsea to hang on to their Stamford Bridge home when it was threatened by property developers

The club said in a statement: 'Chelsea Football Club is tonight deeply saddened to learn of the passing of our Life President Lord Attenborough, CBE at the age of 90.

'He led a long and successful life and always found time for the things in life he loved most, one of which was Chelsea FC.'

Attenborough held a position on Chelsea's board in the 1970s when they won the FA Cup and UEFA Cup Winners' Cup after turning to the club for help with physical training ahead of a film role in the 1940s.

He even introduced the likes of Laurence Olivier, Frank Sinatra, John Wayne and Steve McQueen to the 'Chelsea lifestyle' that become famous for its glamour - something Chelsea put down to 'Lord A'.

 And Attenborough held on to his shares when Chelsea's Stamford Bridge home was threatened by property developers, leading to his appointment at Life Vice-President under Ken Bates and later Life President during the Abramovich era.

Attenborough even credited his 67-year marriage to Chelsea, saying in 2007: 'I went and stood on a bank with a packet of sandwiches with my girlfriend who I eventually married, principally because she agreed to follow Chelsea, and we've been going since 1942.'

As the club pays tribute, fans have joined the outpouring - with some calling on the club to rename Stamford Bridge's East Stand after the late film legend.

Chelsea will wear black armbands against Everton on Saturday as a mark of respect to Lord Attenborough.
