A blogger who writes about Aboriginal affairs has revealed how she was forced to ask a white friend to rent the house she lives in because she was deemed 'too dark' to be accepted for a lease.

Kelly Briggs, who blogs for news websites such as Crikey and The Guardian, tried to rent a property for herself in her hometown of Moree, a rural town in north-western NSW, for six months.

The mother of two, who has over 8,000 followers on Twitter, told the Sydney Morning Herald: 'Racism in Moree is so entrenched that people don't see it.'

Kelly Briggs has revealed she was forced to ask a white friend to rent the house she lives in because no one would let her rent a home for six months

Ms Briggs, who writes about politics and black feminism, said her friends in the Aboriginal community have experienced the same problem when it comes to finding housing.

Despite having a diploma in business governance, the 34-year-old has also been unable to find a job for two years.

On her personal website, The Koori Woman, she previously revealed how when she visited a chemists in Sydney she was trailed constantly by a security guard and wrongly accused of shoplifting. 

'The security guard did not apologise, he didn’t even look at me when he said, I’m just doing my job... No one apologised for embarrassing me, making me feel like a criminal or for falsely insinuating that I had stolen from them,' she wrote.

'It doesn’t matter how old I become, I will never be accorded the respect of the benefit of the doubt when I walk into a store, I will always be singled out, followed and have my bag searched.'

Ms Briggs has started a fundraising campaign so that she can earn a salary from her popular blogs and spoke out about her own housing struggle after the release of the government's Overcoming Indigenous Disadvantage report.

It was announced on Wednesday that the federal government won't set a closing-the-gap justice target despite the report showing indigenous incarceration rates are on the rise.

The latest Overcoming Indigenous Disadvantage report found adult imprisonment rates more than doubled between 2000 and 2013.

Indigenous youths are 24 times more likely to go to prison than non-indigenous young people.

The Australian Greens and Labor are calling for the government to set a justice target, claiming the new statistics show the gap can no longer be ignored.

Indigenous Affairs Minister Nigel Scullion confirmed on Wednesday the government would not set target, a decision he says was not taken lightly.

'We need action rather than targets,' he said, adding the key was getting children into school and adults into work.

Labor described the decision as a 'complete backflip' from a previously bipartisan approach, accusing the government of doing nothing in the past year about a justice target.

'Their attitude can be categorised as ignorance, idleness and inactivity,' opposition indigenous affairs spokesman Shane Neumann told AAP.

The Productivity Commission report, released on Wednesday, also found the number of indigenous Australians admitted to hospital for self harm nearly doubled between 2004 and 2012.

They are nearly three times more likely to be hospitalised for self harm than non-indigenous people.

The same disparity is reported for levels of high or very high psychological distress.

Mr Neumann said areas highlighted by the report, including preventative health, matched those subject to budget cuts.

'The government's got its eye right off the ball,' he said.

The government is determining which programs will be funded under its indigenous advancement strategy, but insists effective frontline services won't be touched.

'Throwing money at this problem continually is not going solve it,' Senator Scullion said.

Labor claims the Aboriginal and Torres Strait Islander Legal Services and Family Violence Protection Legal Services have been gutted.

Indigenous Labor senator Nova Peris said the report was alarming but not surprising and urged government action to address the failures.

The report found progress was being made in several areas, including child mortality rates, life expectancy, Year 12 attainment and employment.

Two-thirds of indigenous people were employed in full time work between 2011-2013, up from 54.6 per cent in 2002.

However, there has been no improvement in basic reading, writing and numeracy rates for school children or family violence.

There were positive changes when it came to adult employment and mortality rates but no change when it came to literacy, domestic violence. Improvements in self harm rates and adult imprisonment actually went backwards.   

IMPROVEMENTS

* Life expectancy gap narrowed from 11.4 to 10.6 years for men, 9.6 to 9.5 years for women

* Mortality rates for children under one have halved over 15 years

* Adult (20-64) post-school qualifications increased 17 per cent over 10 years

* Adults employed full time increased 12 per cent over 10 years

NO CHANGE

* Students achieving national minimum standards for reading, writing, numeracy from 2008 to 2013

* Family violence rates, alcohol and substance abuse rates

* Disability and chronic disease rates

GOING BACKWARDS

* Levels of high psychological distress increased from 27 to 30 per cent since 2004 to 2012

* Hospitalisation for self harm increased 48 per cent over same period

* Adult imprisonment increased 57 per cent from 2000 to 2013.
