Traps have been set up around a lakeside Florida suburb after a family dog was snatched by a gator and pulled into the water this week.

Jessie, a 50-pound mixed-breed, had been the pet of Mark Byers for the last 10 years.

Mr Byers daughter was walking their dog along the lake at the back of their Sunrise home on Tuesday when suddenly an eight-foot-long alligator came out of the water and grabbed her.

'It's an awful tragedy,' Mr Byers told Local 10 News.

'It's terrible.'

Snatched: Jessie was out for a walk along the waters edge in Sunset, Florida, on Tuesday night when she was dragged into the water by a local gator

Missed: Jessie was a beloved part of the Byers family 

Predator: The alligator is said to have been in the freshwater lake in Sunset for years, but had been appearing more frequently over the last couple of weeks

Dangerous: Wildlife officers in the area have urged residents to be careful when approaching the water

Dead: Jessie was pulled into the water in a matter of seconds on Tuesday and never seen again

Scene: Mr Byers said he had built a sea wall to try and keep any gators from getting into his yard

Mr Byers said the gator has been lurking in the lake for as long as he can remember.

However locals say the reptile has been seen much more frequently over the last two weeks.

Mr Byers built a sea wall to stop the animal getting to his dog or his family.

However Jessie was playing in the water while out on the walk - something they could never train her to stop doing.

That's when the gator suddenly snatched her.

'She’s just gone. Things happen in a split second,' Mr Byers told The Sun Sentinel. 

'It’s just a sad situation.'

Upset: Mr Byers adopted Jessie from the Humane Society 10 years ago and said she was part of the family

Walk: The dog was being walked by Mr Byers' daughter, Taylor (pictured) when the incident occurred Tuesday

Scene: The Byers' yard backs onto the freshwater lake

Officers from Florida Fish and Wildlife Conservation Commission are now setting traps along the shore. 

And the future does not sound good for the gator if and when it is trapped.

'My understanding is that gators generally of this size, if they have a history like this, aren't going to be placed elsewhere,' spokeswoman Liz Barraco said.

Ms Barraco warned people who live in the area to be extra cautious, especially if they live around freshwater bodies.

Avoid the waters edge, especially around dusk and dawn, is safest.
