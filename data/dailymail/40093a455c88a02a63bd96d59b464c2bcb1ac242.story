A Chinese father who became a national hero after claiming he lived in a cave to save money for his family has now admitted he never sent a penny home - after his wife caught him out.

Shi Zhiyong, 35, hit the headlines after claiming that he was sleeping in a 10-metre long cave in order to keep all of his £300-a-month pay to help his wife and two sons.

Shi, who had a job as a dockworker in China's coastal Shandong province, was reported to have been sleeping in the cave for the last six months.

Rather than pay up to £20-a-month for rent, Shi said he had decided to save every penny he could from his £300-per-month salary to send back home to his family in Handan in Hebei province.

He told People's Daily: 'I have two children, aged 11 and six. I have to save up money and support the family.'

But he has now admitted that he had fabricated his past and said: ’Sorry I lied. I didn't go back home for the Chinese New Year. 

'I bought all my food by myself. I didn’t save money all these years and have never sent money home.'

Shi had said that he sacrificed his home comforts to ensure his beloved family had more money, and is believed to have slept on simple bedding spread on the floor of the cave while lighting fires from kindling to keep warm. 

He kept very few belongings with him, carrying just a quilt, a radio, a water bottle and a flashlight, along with some clothes.

But after his bizarre living arrangements came to national attention in China, Shi's uncle tracked him down to the top of Yao Mountain where he had been sleeping.

He said: 'It’s been six years, we need to have a good hug!

‘I saw his picture from my phone today, then I searched online and confirmed it was him. He left home six years ago without a trace since.’ 

Confession: But Shi has now admitted he made his story up and said: 'I bought all my food by myself. I didn’t save money all these years and have never sent money home'

Attention: But Shi's story was exposed when media in China became interested in his bizarre living conditions and his family tracked him down

Shi's uncle could not explain why Shi’s wife and two sons had not come to find him, nor did they explain why Shi had left home six years ago, simply adding: ’There might be some small friction.’

Shi said he was forced to carrying his meagre belongings around with him after discovering villagers had been entering the cave and looking through his things whilst he was at work. 

'When I come back from work at night, often the cave had been explored top to bottom by others,' he told the Jinan Times.

He had claimed that he ate at his company's cafeteria during working hours and, when there was no work available, survived on just a couple of sesame seed cakes each day.

The report added that he showers just once a month at a local public bathroom.

However, Shi yesterday abandoned the cave and his boss said Shi had resigned last April.

The boss said: ’He did work as a loader and does have a family back home. He took holidays twice a year, claiming that he was going back home. He is an honest man and a hard worker.’ 

When Shi’s story was first reported in China, he was offered work and accommodation by more than 10 companies.

Now, Shi said he wanted to ‘live life properly at home’, adding that he would put on some clean clothes and have a good wash before returning.

His forgiving family - who believed he was dead - have agreed to let him return to Jinan to continue working.
