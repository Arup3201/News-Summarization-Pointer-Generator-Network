Jailed for 12 months: Drama teacher Simon Parsons (pictured) had a long-term affair with a pupil

A drama teacher who had a five-year affair with a 17-year-old pupil – and fathered her child – was jailed for just 12 months yesterday.

Simon Parsons, 52, whose wife is standing by him, had sex with the girl at the school and his home. Handing down the sentence, the judge described his actions as a ‘breach of trust’.

His wife, who did not attend court, had previously begged the judge to show leniency, insisting her husband was ‘not a monster’, but a ‘gentle man who made a massive mistake’.

But Parsons was handed the maximum possible sentence under current sentencing guidelines.

In this case, the judge said, because she was over 16, he could impose a sentence of no more than 18 months. This was reduced by a third on account of Parsons’ guilty plea.

After he was jailed, the victim’s mother said: ‘Every parent sends their child to school where they expect them to be safe.

‘To find out that school is the very place your child was abused is a very horrifying ordeal for your daughter, and indeed all of your family to have gone through.’

The court heard the victim, who cannot be named and is now taking civil action against her former school, described feeling ‘confused and lost’ and had been ‘let down by a teacher whom she looked up to and trusted’.

She said in a statement: ‘I felt grossed out at one point and then I thought, “Oh well, he fancies me”.’

Parsons was jailed yesterday after he admitted sexual activity with a child by a person in a position of trust

Parsons,  a drama teacher at Castle School (pictured) in Thornbury, South Gloucestershire, first met the teenager when she was 13 and began a relationship with her at 17

Yesterday the judge echoed the girl’s mother’s words, telling Parsons, from Dursley, Gloucestershire, his actions were a ‘breach of trust’. 

Judge Neil Ford QC told the teacher: ‘You didn’t see the girl as a victim of unlawful or inappropriate behaviour, but you now know that your behaviour has had a real impact upon her.

Parents are withdrawing their children from a primary school run by the wife of the teacher ‘groomed’ by his 16-year-old student.

Married couple: Katherine and Stuart Kerner

Stuart Kerner, 44, was convicted of having sex with a pupil at another school, where he was deputy head, but was let off with an 18-month suspended sentence amid huge controversy after the female judge claimed he was effectively groomed by the pupil.

His wife, Katherine, 42, acting head of Wyborne primary in Greenwich, South East London, yesterday returned to her job after being placed on ‘enforced leave’ – much to the disgust of parents who claim she ‘condoned’ her husband’s actions by standing by him. 

The law says there are grounds to disqualify any person from working with under eights if they are living with someone who is banned.

Parents also criticised the school for failing to tell them that she was coming back.

Sarah-Lea Cross, 31, who has two children at the school, is in the process of applying to have them moved. She said: ‘If she’s living with him and supporting him she shouldn’t be here.’

‘I am sure that she is right when she describes the consequences of your actions as resulting in her feeling confused and lost.’

The court heard that as a treat for the girl’s 17th birthday, the teacher had taken her to the theatre in London and then to a hotel where he had sex with her.

The relationship continued after she left school, and she went on to have a baby in her early 20s.

It only came to light after the girl ended things and it became clear to her family what had happened.

A relative was said to have ‘encouraged’ her to tell police about what happened because Parsons was still teaching.

Referring to Parsons’ wife’s plea at a previous hearing, the judge him: ‘Your wife is standing by you and has forgiven you. She is acting in the most difficult of circumstances.

‘You have brought that position on her. I am acutely aware of the misery that these proceeding have brought upon your immediate family.’

Formerly head of drama at The Castle School in Thornbury, Gloucestershire, Parsons showed no reaction as he was sentenced to 12 months in prison.

He was barred from working with children for life after pleading guilty to five counts of sexual activity with a child by a person in a position of trust.

Last night Peter Saunders, of the National Association for People Abused in Childhood, said: ‘We would generally expect that a custodial sentence is absolutely appropriate if society is to make the statement that this is totally unacceptable.

‘I used to be a teacher, and you do not cross that line under any circumstances. To do that is a betrayal.’
