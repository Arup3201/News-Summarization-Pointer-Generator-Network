District JudgeTerence Richard Peter Hollingworth, 63, has been forced to quit after allegedly making a racist remark about an Asian woman victim

A judge has quit after allegedly making a racist comment about an Asian crime victim in court.

Terence Richard Peter Hollingworth had asked lawyers to fetch the harassment victim so he could finish sentencing her ex-boyfriend.

Prosecutor Rachel Parker said she was unsure whether the woman in question, Deepa Patel, could attend at short notice due to work commitments.

The district judge allegedly replied: ‘It won’t be a problem.

‘She won’t be working anywhere important where she can’t get the time off. She’ll only be working in a shop or an off-licence.’

When Miss Parker asked the judge to clarify his comments, he added: ‘With a name like Patel, and her ethnic background, she won’t be working anywhere important where she can’t get the time off. So that’s what we’ll do.’

At this point Miss Parker withdrew from the case at Preston Magistrates’ Court and told the judge: ‘I am professionally embarrassed. I cannot prosecute this case.’

The Crown Prosecution Service made an official complaint after the incident on October 30, and Mr Hollingworth resigned four weeks later from his part-time job as a deputy district judge.

The 63-year-old remains an immigration judge for the Asylum and Immigration Chamber – but is not hearing any cases while he is investigated over his alleged comments. 

He could yet face the sack from this second role, which pays more than £120,000 a year.

Miss Patel, a 22-year-old from Preston, is currently working in an office. She told The Sun: ‘I was born and bred in this country... it’s shocking and disgusting for anyone to say that, especially a judge.

‘He’s the one making legal decisions and deciding people’s freedom and he’s saying stuff like that – it’s ridiculous.

‘You would assume that people of this day and age, especially a judge, wouldn’t be racist.

‘I’m more upset than angry, especially since I had already gone through so much by going to court. I’ve had counselling because of what happened with my ex, so to hear this went on is even more upsetting. I’m glad that I wasn’t in the room at the time, I don’t think I would have coped.’

He made the comments at Preston Magistrates Court after being told a prosecution team could not bring forward the case as 22-year-old Deepa Patel  was not in court

She added it was ‘outrageous’ that Mr Hollingworth is still an immigration judge. ‘He needs to resign altogether,’ she said.

Miss Patel’s ex-boyfriend Parvan Singh, 23, was later jailed for 20 weeks. A court heard he had breached a restraining order, as well as the terms of a suspended sentence imposed in August for beating Miss Patel.

A spokesman for the Judicial Conduct Investigations Office confirmed that Mr Hollingworth – who lives in a rural village in Derbyshire – had resigned his part-time role. They added that his immigration chamber’s president is ‘considering the matter’.

A previous version of this article referred to the Judge as ‘Peter Hollingworth’. We are happy to make clear that the Judge in question is Judge Terence Richard Peter Hollingworth. Judge Peter James Michael Hollingworth, who also sits as a judge in the First Tier Immigration and Asylum Tribunal and a Deputy District Judge, has no connection with Terence Richard Peter Hollingworth or this matter.
