Bookmakers Betfair are facing a backlash from customers after they reversed a payout that was set to cost them millions.

Odds of 28-1 had been offered by the gambling firm on the outright favourite in the 2pm woodiesdiy.com Christmas Hurdle.

That led to a flurry of betting in which a total of £1,642,094 was matched on Voler La Vedette.

And when the horse strolled to a comfortable victory, thousands of customers expecting a grand scale payout were told that all betting had been declared void following a technical error.

A statement from Betfair customer services read: 'Customers betting in-play on this race will have seen that Voler La Vedette was available to back at 29 when the in-running market was suspended, and that a considerable sum was matched on the clear winner at that price.

'An investigation has revealed that this was due to an obvious technical failure which allowed a customer to exceed their exposure limit.

'In accordance with our terms and conditions, all in running bets on this race, both win and place, will be made void.

'We fully appreciate the dissatisfaction this will cause many customers, and apologise for a very poor customer and betting experience.'

A Betfair graph showed over £21million was offered to back Colm Murphy's mare at those odds, even though she was always in contention and looked the obvious winner even before the final flight.

This meant one layer could potentially have lost £600million in only a few minutes if all of the money had been matched.

Betfair suspended the market in order to investigate, with many of the exchange's members in a state of shock on the website's forum.
