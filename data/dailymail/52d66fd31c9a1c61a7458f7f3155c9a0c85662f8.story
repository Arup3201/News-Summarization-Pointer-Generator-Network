A 12-year-old girl has become the latest victim of a dangerous new online trend which sees people setting themselves on fire.

Daisy Schumer, of Cape Girardeau, Missouri, had to be taken to hospital with burns to her back after taking part in what has been dubbed 'the Fire Challenge'.

The new trend has seen videos posted online of people pouring alcohol over themselves and setting the accelerant on fire.

Daisy told KFVS 12 how she was injured however after taking part in the challenge.

She said: 'This person poured the perfume on my stomach and then I told her to stop and then she lit the lighter and I was rolling on the ground trying to get it out and it burned my back.'

Earlier this week it was reported that a Kentucky teenager was recovering from second-degree burns after copying the new trend.

The 15-year-old, who declined to be identified for CBS Affiliate WKYT, poured rubbing alcohol over his chest and filmed himself last Friday.

He told the news organisation: 'I just poured alcohol on it, and lit it, and it just automatically went and burst.'

Firefighters arrived at the home of the boy's aunt and took him to hospital for treatment for severe burns on his chest and abdomen.

The 'Fire Challenge' has seen many upload videos of themselves setting fire to their arms, legs, chest and even genitals

The lucky teenager said that he had no idea of the likely effects because in the videos he had seen, the person who did the 'fire challenge' never kept the camera running long enough afterwards.

Firefighters in Lexington said they hope others listen and don't try to copy the teenager.

'What they don't show at the end of the videos is the consequences of doing this, getting second and third degree burns,' Lexington Fire Department Captain Chris Harrod said to WKYT.

The 'Fire Challenge' is the latest internet phenomenon in the same vein as the the gallon milk and cinnamon challenge.

Some undertake the challenge in a shower so that they can douse themselves with water immediately afterwards

However, while those are relatively safe, this is far more serious.

Videos online reveal a number of young men either using an aerosol canister or alcohol as an accelerant and then lighting their chest, legs, arms or even genital areas.

Most scream and shout as the flames ignite and thrash wildly to put the fire out while friends who are filming laugh out loud.

Others undertake the challenge in a shower, with close access to water should they need it.
