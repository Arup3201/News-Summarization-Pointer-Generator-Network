An estate agent who let himself into a house he was selling and stole the homeowner's iPad has been ordered to do community service

Glenn Tuxford, 19, from Winslow, Buckinghamshire, had a key to Holly Junor's four-bedroom house in Aylesbury because it was on the market with his firm.

But he breached her trust by letting himself in when she was out and taking her iPad Mini, worth more than £300, magistrates in High Wycombe heard.

Holly Junor, 24, had her iPad Mini stolen from her house in Winslow, Buckinghamshire, by her estate agent

Miss Junor told the court she she thought she was 'going mad' when she returned to her £335,000 house and couldn't find the tablet in July this year.

She used her iPhone's Find My IPad app to track her device, and watched as it moved across the town to Tuxford's address. 

Telling the court that a neighbour spotted the estate agent prowling around her home, Miss Junor said: 'I was able to track it as it was moved across town and to his address.'

She added: What really scares me about this was that he was not an opportunist - it was obviously planned.

'Because I had only bought the iPad a couple of days ago and he had not conducted a viewing I don't why he went there in the first place.

'He knew I lived alone and my working hours and that I had no family living nearby.

'I've had to change the locks and I am still trying to sell the house so I had to give the keys to another estate agent after what happened.

'What he did was very unprofessional and I felt totally violated.'  

Tuxford admitted stealing the iPad mini, and was told to pay his victim £310 and do community service (file pic)

Tuxford, who admitted theft, was ordered to do 40 hours' community service and also told to pay £85 costs, £310 compensation to Miss Junor, and a victim surcharge of £60.

He has also lost his job with Taylors estate agents.  

PC Nicola Ambrose, from Thames Valley Police, said: 'Tuxford committed an extremely invasive crime.

'Cases such as these can affect victims for a very long time - not only is their property stolen but there can be long lasting psychological effects.

'He was in a position of trust, and totally abused his position within the estate agents where he worked.' 

This purple-suited estate agent was spotted helping himself to chocolate at a flat in Walthamstow, east London

Yesterday, footage emerged showing an estate agent stealing a bar of chocolate from a flat he was lettng in Walthamstow, east London.

Jon Charter, who lived in the flat, was trialling home security cameras when he caught the purple-suited agent, known only as 'George', helping himself to a large Galaxy bar as he showed prospective tenants around. 

Mr Charter, 42, later complained to the estate agency, which fired 'George', and received texts from the agent saying he had felt dizzy and thought the sugar in the chocolate would help.
