Arsene Wenger launched a passionate defence of his Arsenal reign after supporters called on him to quit on Saturday.

Danny Welbeck ensured the Gunners left the Hawthorns with their first Premier League win since November 1.

But that didn’t stop some disgruntled fans making their feelings towards Wenger abundantly clear, despite his team dominating most of the game against West Bromwich Albion.

After the final whistle, a group of fans revealed a large banner that read: ‘Arsene, thanks for the memories but it’s time to say goodbye.’

Another read: ‘Enough is enough, Wenger out.’ But Wenger insists he is the man lead to lead Arsenal forward, saying: ‘I can do my job, I do my job with total commitment.

‘I would like you to live with me and see for seven days what kind of work we produce, and you will see that it is total commitment.

Some disgruntled Arsenal fans held out a banner suggesting manager Wenger should resign 

‘Am I hurt by any of the criticism? No. Honestly, no.’

Following a string of disappointing defensive displays, Arsenal have now secured two clean sheets in a row.

Wenger has been criticised for sticking to his attacking principles when his side’s defensive flaws have been exposed.

But the Arsenal manager rejected that view, saying: ‘I started to manage a team at the top level in 1983; if I am completely useless tactically, I am a genius — I can hide it very well.’

Meanwhile, fit-again Olivier Giroud says he can be part of a deadly attacking trio for Arsenal. He made his first league start this season after recovering from a broken ankle. Wenger’s 4-2-3-1 system means there is room for only one striker in his team. 

But Giroud insists Danny Welbeck, Alexis Sanchez and he can all play together.

‘Unfortunately we have had injuries like Jack (Wilshere) and other players, but I am taking a lot of pleasure from being back,’ he said. 

‘It is good, sometimes, for your mental strength to go through this and this is why I am stronger. It was a real test. When you are far away from the pitch it is tough.’

 Wenger is adamant he can lead Arsenal through their difficult spell in the Premier League
