The body of an ex-Royal Marine who was the first Briton to be killed while fighting against ISIS has been returned to his family in a 'comforting' ceremony attended by hundreds of Syrian Kurds.

Konstandinos Erik Scurfield, from Barnsley, was shot dead on March 2 while fighting in Syria alongside Kurdish forces in the frontline village of Tel Khuzela. 

The 25-year-old's body was given to his father and uncle in a ceremony on the Syria-Iraq border involving hundreds of Syrian Kurds flying their brightly coloured flags.

Respect: Hundreds of Syrian Kurds attended a ceremony, during which they handed over Konstandinos Erik Scurfield's body to his grieving father and uncle, who had travelled to the region

Killed: Mr Scurfield, from Barnsley, was shot dead on March 2 while fighting in Syria alongside the Kurds

The coffin - which has a picture of Mr Scurfield attached, and was draped in both the Kurdish and Union flags - is accompanied by a guard of honour, comprised of both male and female soldiers.

 At one point, a woman dressed in a headscarf pulls Mr Scurfield's devastated father Chris close to him, to kiss him on the head.

The gathered crowd then watched as the coffin was loaded onto an ambulance to be taken to Erbil, the capital of Iraqi Kurdistan.

Chris later told the BBC the ceremony was 'overwhelming' and 'very special and very comforting' to his family.

The Foreign Office refused to comment on when his body might be repatriated.

Mr Scurfield, who was an expert in battlefield medicine, is believed to have travelled to Syria three or four months ago hoping to provide medical and humanitarian support.

Tribute: Mr Scurfield's coffin was carried out by Kurdish fighters, who had gathered to pay their respects

Honour: The coffin, which was draped in both the Union and Kurdish flags, was then taken to Erbil

He was said to have been 'horrified by the atrocities being carried out by ISIS'.

His family, including archaeologist parents Chris and Vicci and his student sister Georgianna, said they were heartbroken but proud of him.

In a statement following his death they said: 'His flame might have burned briefly but it burned brightly with love, courage, conviction and honour and we are very proud of him.'

While high numbers of foreigners are known to have joined IS, around 100 Westerners - including several Britons - are thought to have travelled to fight alongside the Kurds.

Last month, a 19-year-old serving British soldier was returned to his unit after joining the Kurdish peshmerga.
