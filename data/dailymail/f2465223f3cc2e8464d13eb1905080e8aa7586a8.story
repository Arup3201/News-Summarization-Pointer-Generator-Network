One Direction fans have already been rocked by the news that Zayn Malik and Perrie Edwards' engagement may be over after a picture was revealed of the singer cosying up to another woman in Thailand.

And now it has been reported that there is another bout of love woes in the band, as Louis Tomlinson's long-term relationship with Eleanor Calder is also over.

The Sun reports that the young star was pictured kissing an unidentified bikini-clad woman in a pool after an all-night party in Bangkok.

And a representative for Louis confirmed to MailOnline that he has indeed parted ways from 22-year-old Eleanor, whom he had been in a relationship with for around four years.

It's over: Louis Tomlinson's long-term relationship with Eleanor Calder has come to an end

'Louis and Eleanor split up two weeks ago. They have not announced this as they wanted some privacy during this time,' the spokesperson stated. 

Meanwhile, a source told The Sun: 'They were kissing on and off for about 15 minutes. Louis was just wearing his boxers, having stripped off to swim.

'They were snogging passionately. I thought it was Eleanor until she turned round. He is going to be in a bit of trouble.

It's thought that the 23-year-old pop singer had been enjoying a raucous night at the Sukhothai hotel in Thailand's capital with bandmate Zayn, along with a couple of unknown girls.

It was around 6.30 in the morning on March 14 when he was spotted wearing just his underpants with his arms around the mystery woman, where they kissed for quarter of an hour.

The witness also added that the boys appeared to have been drinking all night at the hotel, and were being watched over by a security guard.

'Louis had stripped off and got in the pool before he began kissing his girl,' they said. 

Apparently, they all spent time together for around 30 minutes before leaving as a group at around 7am, just after dawn. 

However, it's thought Louis was actually single when the potentially incriminating pictures were taken.

Tangled up in love: The news of Louis' love split comes hot on the heels of Zayn Malik's relationship woes with fiancee Perrie Edwards, after he was seen cosying up to another woman in Thailand

Meanwhile, both Louis and Eleanor have remained quiet on the subject of their split, with the pretty brunette merely posting about her recent trip to Los Angeles on her Instagram page.

The couple had been an item for four years after initially being introduced by Harry Styles, and Eleanor last year acted as the Maid of Honour at Louis' mum's wedding.

She even shared a sweet snap of herself in her pretty dress alongside her suit-clad man on the day, along with the caption: 'Maid of Honour & Best Man.'

It's thought that Eleanor was going to travel with One Direction to Asia, where they are currently performing as part of their world tour, but at the last minute opted to go to the USA instead.

The stress of the constant travelling the globe is said to have been the root cause of the love split between Louis and Eleanor, who had often been thought of as the strongest pairing in the boy band.

The news of Louis and Eleanor's split comes in the wake of the crisis over Zayn's engagement with Little Mix star Perrie.

Perrie was pictured leaving the home she shares with her fiance after a five hour chat in the early hours of Friday morning, while shielding her face.

Cosying up: They were never afraid to put on a public display of affection

The singer was seen getting into a taxi with several bulky bags loaded beside her as she attempted to go incognito for the journey, after her partner flew into the country from Thailand in the early hours and went straight to the pair's home, arriving at 5am.

The couple's relationship has come under scrutiny after the One Direction star was pictured holding hands with a blonde female in Thailand earlier in the week.

Zayn immediately denied the claims but has quit the current 1D tour due to the stress of the situation.

It has now been claimed that Zayn is 'struggling' with his fame.

After Zayn was spotted cosying up to Essex girl Lauren Richardson, causing speculation he had cheated on Perrie, a source told The Sun newspaper: 'Zayn can't cope with his private life being scrutinised to this level.

Boys in trouble? Zayn and Louis have been rocked by the recent allegations of supposed parties while the band have been touring in Thailand

'He's worried if he'll ever be able to managed the constant attention like the rest of his bandmates.'

Zayn pulled out of a commercial recording in Hong Kong on Thursday and flew back to the UK due to the stress of media speculation on his private life. 

And now fresh reports claim that Zayn had actually 'handpicked' Lauren out of a crowd while partying one night in Thailand.

According to 19-year-old Lauren's fellow holiday-goer Sean Dolan, she boasted about the 22-year-old handsome lad and their evening together.

The incriminating picture: Zayn publicly apologised after being pictured with his arm around Lauren and told his fans, 'I'm sorry for what it looks like'

Making friends: Lauren wasn't the only person Zayn took pictures with but she is the only person he was spotted holding hands with

Speaking to The Sunday Mirror, he said: 'She said Zayn was a lovely guy, and she'd been back to where they were staying – which was apparently incredible.

'She said each of them had a suite to themselves, and she was allowed to take a look around and even messed around in the pool. 

'She said she had given Zayn her number but didn't expect to hear from him again and had enjoyed hanging out together – it sounds like she just had a great time.'
