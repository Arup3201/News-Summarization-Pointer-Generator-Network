Stroke patients admitted to hospital at the weekend could have a higher risk of dying on badly staffed wards, new research suggests.

A study of 56,000 patients found a huge disparity in the number of nurses working on stroke units at weekends.

The worst staffed wards saw an extra death for every 25 patients within a month of admission, the data shows.

The research, carried out by specialists from the Royal College of Physicians and five British universities, found a five-fold difference in weekend staffing between the best and worst hospitals.

Stroke patients admitted to hospital at the weekend could have a higher risk of dying wards with fewer nurses, new research suggests

While the best stroke units had five nurses for every ten patients, the worst-staffed had just one nurse monitoring ten people.

The study, which used data from 103 English stroke units over 18 months, found that death rates are directly related to the number of nurses on the ward.

Remarkably, the researchers found specialist doctors did not have the same impact on mortality.

There was no significant difference in death rates in units where consultants did weekend rounds and those where they did not, according to the data, which was collected in 2011 and 2012.

But the study suggests that nurses - who are more likely to spot problems with eating or breathing - are vital to life expectancy.

Taking the average figures for all 103 hospitals, the researchers found only a ‘borderline’ difference between the death rates for patients admitted on weekends and those admitted on weekdays.

But they said that picture ‘masked’ a huge variation between different stroke units - with poorly-staffed wards seeing rising mortality for weekend patients.

The paper, published last night in the journal PLOS Medicine, reports that patients admitted at weekends to a well-staffed ward, with three nurses for every ten patients, had an 11.2 per cent chance of dying within a month.

That death rate rose to 15.2 per cent on stroke wards with 1.5 nurses for ten patients, meaning an extra death for every 25 patients.

The authors wrote: ‘Patients admitted on a weekend to a stroke unit with below-average nurse/bed ratios had a higher risk of death than those admitted on a weekday.

‘By contrast, weekend admission to a stroke unit with above-average nurse/bed ratios was not associated with an excess of mortality task compared to patients admitted during a weekday.’

The NHS recently issued new guidelines advising hospitals to provide a nurse for every eight patients on general wards, but there is no guidance on how many nurses should work on specialist wards covering specific problems such as strokes.

The survey of 56,000 stroke patients in the UK found the worst staffed wards saw an extra death for every 25 patients within a month of admission

Study author Dr Ben Bray, of the Royal College of Physicians, said: ‘We found a strong relationship between the number of nurses working on a weekend and the risk of a patient dying after a stroke.

‘It is up to individual hospitals to review their staffing levels and for policy makers to look at this sort of evidence and point to what they think would be minimum levels of nurses.’

Dr Peter Carter, chief executive of the Royal College of Nursing, said the disparity was unacceptable.

A Department of Health spokesman said: ‘NHS Emergency stroke units are open seven days a week and provide excellent care. 

‘Getting staffing levels right is a key priority for hospitals, but we understand it can’t be achieved overnight.

'Progress has been made and the addition of 6,300 more nurses on hospital wards since 2010 is making a big difference.’

‘This is further evidence of the vital importance of having proper nurse staffing levels to ensure good patient care,’ he said.

‘If a hospital has enough nurses in place, stroke patients are more likely to survive and to recover.

‘It is unacceptable that stroke patient mortality rates are higher at weekends when staffing levels tend to be lower.

‘Driving up standards of patient care in the NHS requires commitment to investing in the nursing workforce.

'We’re worried that this isn’t happening and that there remains much more work to do in providing safe staffing levels for every health setting.’

Nikki Hill, deputy director of external affairs at the Stroke Association, added: ‘Nurses are a vital part of the specialist stroke team, helping more people survive and thrive after stroke.

'Stroke is a medical emergency, so stroke survivors should have access to the best levels of specialist diagnosis and treatment seven days a week.  

‘Correct staffing levels of specialist stroke nurses play a key role in ensuring that no one dies needlessly of stroke.’
