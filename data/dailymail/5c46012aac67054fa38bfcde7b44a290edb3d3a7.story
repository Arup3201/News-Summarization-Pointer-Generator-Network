Police say that a suspect has been arrested after shooting two high school students in Philadelphia this afternoon.

The suspect has not been identified but is believed to be male and he was arrested outside of his house.

The shooting inside the gym was caught on video tape which helped police apprehend the suspect just over an hour after the incident at Delaware Valley Charter School.

Scene: The shooting took place inside the gym at Delaware Valley Charter High School in northern Philadelphia and the two victims were teenage students but are both said to be in stable condition

'There is a video and according to the video there were roughly 7 kids in there- it wasn't a gym class some where shooting hoops,' police commissioner Charles Ramsey said to CBS Philadelphia.

For the first hour after the shooting, police were searching for the suspect as he was able to flee the scene but they used the video tape to identify the suspect.

Authorities say a male student and a female student were shot, both of whom are 15-years-old.

Each student was shot in an arm and are said to be in stable condition.

Arrested: Police commissioner Charles Ramsey reported that a 15 year old male suspect was arrested at his house about an hour after shooting but that he was not involved in any way

Caught: The suspect, who has so far only been identified as a male, was caught by police as he was either entering or leaving his home on this block in Philadelphia about an hour after the shooting

The students have been taken to a hospital near the school.

Police Inspector Joe Sullivan tells KYW-TV it's unclear whether the shots were fired from inside or outside the school.

A spokesman for the school district hasn't responded to a call seeking comment.

Today's incident in the Logan neighborhood in Philadelphia is the second school shooting of the new year as two students were injured by a fellow student in New Mexico.

A shotgun was used in the Tuesday shooting Roswell shooting but the make of weapon from today has not been released.
