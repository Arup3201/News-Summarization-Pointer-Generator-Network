The town of Dorking has become a laughing stock online because of a nearby woodland which jokers say looks like a penis.

Social networks were buzzing with jokes after it was noticed that a woods in the south west of the town looked like male genitals on satellite images.

American Dmitiri Vorontsov, 26, from North Carolina, USA was one of first to spot the similarity.

He said: 'What is the fascination with penises in Dorking? Is that where Viagra was invented?'

After the images went viral, residents in the town also took to Twitter to poke fun at the shape of the small forest.

Gavin Critchley tweeted: 'Lovely to see a nice bit of wood'

And resident Helen joked: 'Knew I moved here for a reason! Wood hoo!'

Others said they hoped it would make the town a new tourist attraction.

The similarity was spotted after residents in Hoylake, Wirral, were mocked after a similar comparison was made about their street last year.

Residents in Hoylake, Wirral, feared house prices in their streets would tumble after it was noticed their homes also looked like a penis from space

Those living in the area's George Road, Edward Road and Yeoman Cottages even considered moving for fear the joke would hit house prices.

Satellite shots from Google Maps and Google Earth have often led to internet mischief.

Last April there was widespread online speculation that a vicious crime may have taken place in the Dutch city of Almere.

Pictures taken from space showed an apparent bloody trail leading along a waterside pier towards a local lake.

But the mystery was later cleared up when the owner of a dog came forward and said the 'blood' was actually the wet trail left by the pet after his swim.

And in 2012 a Sydney-based group, called the Glue Society, tweaked satellite imagery to portray four Biblical events, including Noahâ€™s Ark, Adam and Eve in the Garden of Eden and Moses the parting the Red Sea.

A dog's wet trail, visible on Satellite images (left), led some to believe a gruesome murder had taken place in Almere, Holland, while an Australian group altered images from space to recreate biblical scenes, including the parting of the Red Sea (right).
