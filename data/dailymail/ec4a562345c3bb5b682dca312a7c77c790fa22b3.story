The longtime Connecticut home of one of Hollywood's most celebrated actresses could be yours - assuming you have about $15 million.

The beachfront home of Katharine Hepburn - that in the latter part of her life she often referred to as 'paradise' - is on the market in the Fenwick borough of Old Saybrook in Connecticut's posh Middlesex County, and its current owners are asking a bargain $14.8 million for the 8,300-square-foot home.

The newly renovated property had been in Hepburn's family for decades, and was the famed actress' home until her death in 2003.

For sale: Hollywood legend Katharine Hepburn's beachfront, Connecticut home is currently for sale by its current owner

Hollywood: The Hollywood legend owned the Fenwick home for decades until her death in 2003

Estate: The home is one of three lots on Hepburn's former property that the new owner, Frank Sciame, plans to sell separately

Private: The estate comes complete with its own private beach and mooring for boats

The home is on a 1.5-acre lot right on the Long Island Sound, where the home's new owners will be able to soak in a view of the sound from the property's private beach.

In addition to the beach, the home comes complete with a private dock, a boat mooring and a pond, the listing agent, Colette Harron of William Pitt Sotheby's International Realty, tells the Wall Street Journal.

Hepburn's former home is complete with 7 1/2 bathrooms and six bedrooms, and is part of a larger, three-lot property purchased by Frank Sciame, founder of Manhattan-based Sciame Construction, from Hepburn's estate in 2004 for $6 million.

'Paradise': The Hollywood star would often use the property as an escape from New York or L.A. for her and her family

Spacious: The 8,300-square-foot home sits on a 1 1/2-acre lot on the Long Island Sound

Renovations: The home's current owner, Frank Sciame, has completely renovated the six-bedroom home

Scenic: In addition to the view of Long Island Sound, the home also has a pond on the property

Sciame completely renovated the home after he purchased it, and initially put it on the market in 2011 - as well as the other two lots, which makes the total acreage for the property about 3 1/2 acres - for $28 million.

In 2012, Sciame upped the price to $30 million after he gained approval to build an additional 3,000-square-foot home on one of the lots.

Last year, the entire property was taken off the market, only to be put back on about a year later - however, the only lot currently for sale is the one with Hepburn's former home on it.

Sciame says he's changed strategies in regard to how he plans to sell the properties, explaining to the Journal, 'the best return on investment is to sell the properties separately.'

'Paradise': In her 1996 memoir, Hepburn described her home in Fenwick as 'paradise'

Compound: The property is part of a collection of properties that owner Frank Sciame plans to sell separately

Tub time: The home is equipped with seven recently renovated bathrooms in addition to the six bedrooms

Millions: Sciame bought the property from Hepburn's estate in 2004 for $6 million. He's now carving it up and selling the properties separately

He says he now plans to potentially keep the lot with the newly built 3,000-square-foot home for his family and sell the other lots - including the one with Hepburn's former home - separately, noting that he is in the process of getting approval to build a house on the third lot.

Before Sciame's plans to carve up the property, it served as a retreat for Hepburn and her family.

In her 1996 memoir, Me, Hepburn referred to her Fenwick estate as 'paradise,' likely do to its scenic views and access to golf, swimming and tennis, three things the film icon loved.
