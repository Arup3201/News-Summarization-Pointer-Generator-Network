If you like vacations to include filthy bathrooms, nerve-wracking elevator rides and a potential murder scene then say hello the Leland Hotel - at least, that is, if you believe the online reviews.

The historic Detroit landmark which opened in 1927 promoted itself as a luxury hotel with 800 rooms in the bustling downtown area. In its heyday, there was also a dining room, coffee shop, ball room and 11 stores.

However as fortunes changed in the once-industrious Michigan city, so did the luck of the hotel where in recent years guests have complained of indescribable smells, surly staff and filthy conditions up until it finally closed its doors.

Hotel of horrors: Among guests' complaints about The Leland Hotel in downtown Detroit are rude staff, paper-thin walls and filthy rooms

Enjoy your stay! The Leland closed its doors as a hotel several years ago and has been converted into apartments

Creepy: The once-grand hotel was slated by guests in reviews who described the terrifying condition of the rooms and the unsavory characters roaming the halls

Reviews posted on Tripadvisor.com by one-time guests of the Leland allege that conditions were almost comically bad at the hotel.

According to a Detroit couple, who claim to have stayed in March 2009 while attending a music festival in the downtown area, the Leland 'is an experience all in itself'. 

The guest, registered on the travel site as Mwoike, writes: '...the staff was (is) extremely unhelpful, and when we finally got up to our room (the elevators are as horrific as everyone has described) and begun to unpack, another couple unlocks our room door and walks in. The hotel double booked our room! 

'One of the years we stayed there... Someone had been stabbed right in front of the doors to the hotel and there was a huge puddle of blood on the ground.

'Another time, in the very early morning, we were verbally assaulted by someone who apparently worked in the hotel.'

Grand: The lobby of the Leland is still impressive but one guest commented that the dance club in the building left you feeling like you were inside a speaker

Room with a view: It's hard to see what attracted visitors to the downtown Detroit landmark

Landmark: The hotel opened in 1927 but in its final years was dogged by scathing reviews from guests

They do admit that the lobby is 'huge and has an old timey beauty to it' but thanks to the dance club downstairs, it is 'like being inside a subwoofer'.

Another guest Vader W, who claimed to have traveled all the way from Scotland to the hotel, complained of 'a smell to it that I could never quite work out' in the same lobby.

He alleged: 'The elevators seemed like a zoo, everytime you went in you found another unique local savage and with it the feeling of watching your back and pockets.'

Vader also claimed that his hotel room windows were coated in dirt, the toilet and bath had not been cleaned while the shower didn't work properly.

Scary stay: Guests noted that the graffiti-tagged hallways and poor lighting were not for the 'faint-hearted'

Grimy: Chunks of plaster missing from a dank wall at the Leland

Heyday: The Detroit-Leland boasted 800 rooms, a ballroom and grand lobby when it first opened in 1927

He concluded: 'AVOID AT ALL COSTS!'

Curbed.com rounded up the best of the worst reviews from the 20-storey hotel. These
 included such reports: 'If you have a weak heart or are easily spooked, I DO NOT 
recommend taking the stairs. Graffiti tagged walls and dimly lit wells 
made this an experience in its self.'

Another former guest claimed: 
'I saw the several large broken pieces of plaster, which had hours 
earlier been a 3 by 1 foot section of the archway to the door...My 
friend's head was nearly crushed while he slept by a piece of the 
ceiling...'

It is unclear when The Leland finally closed its doors as a hotel but now operates as a private apartment block. A person who answered the phone for the Leland on Sunday did not have any comment.
