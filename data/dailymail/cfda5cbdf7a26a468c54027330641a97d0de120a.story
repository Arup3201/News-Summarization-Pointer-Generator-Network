A Tom Brady fan so rabid he had the quarterback's helmet tattooed across his head has been busted for possession of Spice, a synthetic marijuana.

Victor Thompson, 45, was arrested by St. Petersburg cops last month when he let them search his pockets.

Thompson had been seen trespassing outside a community center.

He even has the name of the manufacturer, Riddell, across his forehead plus an NFL logo and small American flag. The word Patriots is across the back

The Smoking Gun review of the police report revealed that Thompson claimed he was unaware the drug was banned in Florida as it was still legal in his home state of New Hampshire.

He told police he bought it from 'a black male for $15' at a park downtown. 

He had only just moved to Florida three weeks before the bust.

He has a 'tattoo head-patriots football helmet' according to the 'Scars, Marks, Tattoos, or other distinguishing features' section of the police report.

The tattoos create the effect that he is wearing a New England Patriots helmet with Brady's number 12 on it as well as the word 'Patriots' across the back of his head.

Not quite identical: Tom Brady needn't worry anyone mistake Thompson for him

He even has the name of the manufacturer, Riddell, across his forehead plus an NFL logo and small American flag. 

A man who cares about detail, he even included a tiny, green dot to show that the helmet is electronically fixed to receive plays transmitted from the sidelines. 

His tattoos were so intriguing - and extensive - police had him pose for four separate booking photos. 

Thompson is being held in the Pinellas County jail.
