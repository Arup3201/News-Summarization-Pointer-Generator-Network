A 62-year-old man has died in a house fire in what is thought to be Britain's first death from an exploding e-cigarette.

His body was found in the living room of his flat in Wallasey, Merseyside, by a member of the public after a small fire broke out in the bedroom.

Investigators believe the blaze started when an e-cigarette that was charging in the bedroom exploded and set fire to an oxygen concentrator - thought to have been used by the victim.

A spokeswoman for the Department for Communities and Local Government said she was unaware of any other deaths caused by the electronic devices.

Up in flames:  The 62-year-old was discovered in his flat in Wallasey, Merseyside, by firefighters after a small fire broke out in the bedroom of the property - believed to have been caused by an electronic cigarette

It is thought that the man was using a third-party charger that did not come with the original e-cigarette.  

Emergency services were called to the address - a large house converted into flats - at 11.39am on Tuesday, but the fire was out before they arrived.

The man has not yet been publicly identified, but next of kin have been informed.

A spokesperson for Merseyside Fire and Rescue said: 'The exact cause of death is yet to be established, but the subsequent fire investigation identified that an e-cigarette that had been charging in the bedroom exploded, caught fire and ignited the oxygen tube of an oxygen concentrator which may have been in use by the occupier.'

An oxygen concentrator is used to raise the blood oxygen levels to prevent damage to the heart or brain by people with severe respiratory or circulatory conditions. 

Risk: Charging e-cigarettes are believed to have caused a number of devastating house fires

An inquest is set to be held and the death is not being treated as suspicious. 

Firefighters  said the charging device being used at the time may not have been the one supplied with the original e-cigarette.

Area manager for Merseyside Fire and Rescue, Myles Platt, said: 'Only use the original charger or electrical cables supplied and ensure you purchase electrical items from a reputable source.'

'We urge people to always use electrical equipment in accordance with the manufacturer's instructions and guidance, always ensure that no electrical items are left charging overnight or left unattended for a long period when being charged and do not mix parts from different e-cigarettes.'

How they work: Electronic cigarettes simulate tobacco by releasing an aerosol that resembles smoke

The blaze is the ninth fire believed to have been caused by the devices in Merseyside alone since January 2013.

A spokesperson for Merseyside Police said: 'At this time the man's death is not being treated as suspicious and the matter has been referred to the coroner. The man has been identified and next of kin have been advised.' 

1) Don't hold the button for longer than needed:

You should not have to hold down the vaping button for any longer than a few seconds.

2) Don't let the atomizer overheat:

Holding down the button on your e-cigarette long enough could cause the atomizer to overheat. 

3) Use the correct charger:

 Only use the charger that came with your e cigarette or is 100% compatible with your e cigarette.

4) Charge in a clutter free area:

The more material around the charger, the more likely it is there will be a fire.

5) Charge on a non-flammable surface:

Don't charge on top of carpet, paper cardboard.

There have been a number of serious accidents and house fires caused by e-cigarettes in the last few years, increasing calls for tighter regulation of the devices.

In April an e-cigarette exploded in a barmaid's face in North Yorkshire.

Laura Baty, 18, was serving at the Buck Inn Hotel in Richmond when she heard an almighty bang and saw fire coming towards her.

Before the teenager had time to think following the explosion on Saturday, she could feel the fire coming at her, adding: 'I felt the heat as I ran away'. 

And in June a family's home was left gutted by flames after an e-cigarette exploded while it was charging, killing the neighbour's cat.

Gutted: Victoria Newton and her children (left-right) Dylan Thomas-James, Millie Anne James, and Lauren James, were  left homeless after an e-cigarette exploded in their house, engulfing it in flames

Homeless: Ms Newton grabbed Dylan, four, as she fled the house after hearing an enormous bang upstairs

Victoria Newton, 34, and her three children were 'lucky to be alive' after the fire.

She was at home with her four-year-old son Dylan and her two daughters Millie-Anne, nine, and Lauren, 13, when they heard a bang and the house in Leigh, Greater Manchester, became engulfed in flames.

She said: 'It was a nightmare. My daughter Lauren had some friends round and one of her mates had plugged in her e-cigarette and they'd gone out playing.'
