Around 1.75 billion people around the world already own a smartphone – but that leaves more than five billion people who don’t.

Google is attempting to close this gap with its Android One scheme, designed to create ‘high quality’ phones for people on a budget.

The first three phones on the scheme have launched in India, and Google said more countries will follow by the end of this year and into 2015.

'I’ve long been inspired by the internet and how it opens the doors to opportunity. 

'It provides access to knowledge, no matter who you are or where you are,’  

‘[But] even entry-level smartphones still remain out of reach for many - in some of these countries the average monthly income is around $250.

‘Android One aims to help tackle these challenges.

'By working closely with phone and silicon chip makers to share reference designs and select components, we’re making it easier for our partners to build phones that are not just great to use, but also affordable.

‘They have lots of processing power, so you can get information quickly.

‘They have high-quality front- and rear-facing cameras. 

'And for all those pictures, along with your apps and videos, Android One phones will have expandable storage. 

Additionally, because Google is in partnership with the phone makers, it will roll out software updates to the phones directly, so users won't need to wait for carriers or device makers to offer updates.

Other features include 1.3 GHz MediaTek quad-core processors, 4.5-inch screens, 854 x 480 pixel displays, 5MP rear cameras, 2MP front cameras (pictured), and 1700mAh batteries
