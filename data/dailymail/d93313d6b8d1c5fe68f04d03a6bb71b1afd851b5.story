A number of meteors created by the remnants of Halley's Comet have been snapped streaking over Britain's skies.

The famous comet was last seen in 1986 and is not due to brighten the Earth skies until 2061, as it appears once every 75 years.

But each year in mid-to-late October, Earth passes through the comet's dusty debris, and the pre-dawn sky can light up with a stunning display of shooting stars.

Wayne Perry from Plymouth told MailOnline that this was just the second attempt at photographing a meteor shower. He waited in a field in Princetown, just outside Plymouth, from between midnight to 1am this morning to take this image using a Nikon d7100

John Maclean of Exeter Meteor Detection system in Devon was able to capture the phenomenon above Exeter last night.

'As the Earth moves through this dust in its orbit, we see meteors in a shower named the Orionids, because they seem to radiate from the constellation of Orion,' said Mr Maclean.

His image of a fireball was captured at 5:44am on Wednesday morning.

'I wonder if my neighbour realised what was heading for his house!' Mr Maclean said.

The spectacular show was the result of Earth's encounter with the remnants of the tail of Halley's Comet which last passed the planet in 1986 and left behind a trail of dust

When rock particles break away from the comet and pass through the Earth's upper atmosphere, it appears that the sky is full of 'falling stars'. 

The meteors are known as 'Orionids' because they seem to fan out from a region to the north of the constellation Orion's second brightest star, Betelgeuse.

Comet of origin: 1P/Halley

Radiant: Just to the north of constellation Orion's bright star Betelgeuse

Active: 2 Oct. - 7 Nov. 2014

Peak activity: 21-22 Oct. 2014

Peak activity meteor count: Approximately 20 meteors per hour in moonless skies.

Meteor velocity: 66 km (41 miles) per second

Another image was taken by Wayne Perry from Plymouth who told MailOnline that this was just the second attempt at photographing a meteor shower.

He waited in a field in Princetown, just outside Plymouth, from between midnight to 1am this morning to take the images using a Nikon d7100.

'It would be absolutely beautiful for a little while and then the cloud came over and covered it,' he said.

'I was obviously on my own, but when I saw it, I just shouted out "Whooaa!" It was amazing.'

The Orionid meteor shower is not the strongest, but it is one of the most beautiful showers of the year, according to Bill Cooke, the head of Nasa Meteoroid Environment Office.

Sky watchers may also be able to catch the shower between midnight and dawn on 22 October. This image was taken by Wayne Perry in Plymouth as he was waiting for the meteor shower earlier this morning

This is because shower is framed by some of the brightest stars in the heavens.

Constellations such as Taurus, Gemini and Orion provide a glittering backdrop for the display. The brightest star of all, Sirius, is located just below Orion's left foot.

The comets rained down between midnight and dawn this morning with as many as 25 meteors appearing each hour.

Sky watchers may also be able to catch the shower again between midnight and dawn on 22 October.

People living in North America, Europe, most parts of Asia, and northern parts of South America will be able to see the meteor shower by looking towards the south-eastern sky.

Those who live in the southern hemisphere can see see the shower by looking to the north eastern sky.
