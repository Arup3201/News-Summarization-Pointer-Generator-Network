The NYPD is on high alert for potential terrorist attacks as the trial of hate preacher Abu Hamza starts later this month.

The first day of the terrorist’s trial coincides with the beginning of Jewish holiday Passover on April 14.

Speaking to a conference of Jewish leaders in New York on Tuesday, NYPD officials said they are aware that the trial may ‘inspire’ terrorist acts.

Trial fears: Radical Islamist cleric Abu Hamza, seen in a courtroom drawing with his defense attorney Joshua Dratel last month, is due to stand trial on April 14, something which has put the NYPD on high alert

A decade after Abu Hamza was first arrested in Britain on a US warrant for terrorism charges, he is finally due to go on trial in Manhattan.

The hook-handed cleric is facing allegations that he controlled a global network of jihadists.

This week, Hamza, who was extradited from Britain in 2012, was described as a ‘star’ among terrorists, by Rebecca Weiner, director of intelligence analysis for the NYPD.

‘We are attuned to the possibility that his upcoming trial may inspire more terror,' Ms Weiner told religious leaders during a pre-Passover conference, the NYDailyNews reports.

'It is a major priority for us in the next couple of weeks.'

Deputy Commissioner of Intelligence John Miller asserted that although the NYPD is on high alert during the trial, there is 'is no specific, credible threat' at this time.

Last month, Hamza was dubbed a ‘terrorist leader of global reach’ by the US government who claims he sent ‘lieutenants’ to terror camps worldwide.

Prosecutors have lodged legal papers ahead of his forthcoming trial alleging that: ‘The [American] government will show that the defendant was a terrorist leader of global reach who ... sent his young lieutenants around the world to engage in terror training.’

The prosecution will say the preacher used Finsbury Park mosque in north London as a recruiting base, not only inspiring jihadists with his hateful sermons, but also allegedly directly providing support to Al Qaeda from Britain.

Court papers show prosecutors consider Hamza so dangerous that they have argued jurors should be given anonymity and an armed guard for their safety.

He faces 11 terrorism charges spanning America, Europe, the Middle East and Asia which go back as far as 1998.

 If convicted, he faces spending the rest of his life in a maximum security US prison.

The trial, scheduled to last six weeks, could prove embarrassing for the British security services and previous governments who allowed the preacher to operate freely for years after he arrived here from Egypt, despite openly giving sermons praising Osama bin Laden in the wake of the 9/11 attacks.

Court papers allege one of his ‘lieutenants’ from London was sent to Afghanistan for ‘violent jihad training’ and said he was prepared to take part in attacks against American and Jewish targets.

Hamza is separately accused of trying to set up a ‘jihad training camp’ in Bly, Oregon where one of his followers is said to have penned a letter to Osama bin Laden saying: ‘We love you here.’

Hamza is also charged with involvement in a hostage-taking incident in Yemen in 1998 that led to the deaths of three Britons and an Australian.

The preacher was first arrested in Britain in May 2004 on a US extradition warrant and charged with 15 terrorism offences.

In 2006 he was jailed for soliciting murder and stirring up racial hatred.

He was extradited to America in 2012 after a costly and protracted legal battle invoking human rights law.

He denies all the charges.
