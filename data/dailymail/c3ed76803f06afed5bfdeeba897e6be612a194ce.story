Nick Griffin: The BNP leader has said people have the 'right to discriminate' after he put the address of a gay couple who won a landmark court ruling onTwitter

BNP leader Nick Griffin faced calls for his arrest yesterday after he urged a mob to protest outside the home of a gay couple who had won a landmark court case.

The far-Right politician called for his followers to descend on the home of Michael Black and John Morgan after they won damages from a Christian B&B owner for discrimination.

Mr Griffin took to Twitter to ask for the address of the ‘two bullying “gay” activists’ so he could arrange a demonstration about homeowners being able to ‘rent rooms to whomsoever they wish’.

After he was given their address, Mr 
Griffin threatened the couple that a ‘British Justice team’ would be 
coming to ‘give you a... bit of a drama’.

The tweets provoked widespread criticism and gay rights campaigners called for police to look into the matter.

Mr Black and Mr Morgan, who won their
 civil case against Susanne Wilkinson on Thursday, also revealed that 
they had contacted the police. Officers are now investigating their 
complaints and keeping watch on the couple’s home.

Police are checking whether Mr Griffin’s comments breached the Communications Act or were an incitement to hatred.

Mr Black, 64, and Mr Morgan, 59, who 
live near Huntingdon in Cambridgeshire, were awarded £1,800 each at 
Reading County Court for injury to their feelings after they had booked a
 double room at a B&B in Cookham, Berkshire, but were not allowed to
 use it by Christian Mrs Wilkinson.

Case: Gay couple Michael Black, 62 and John Morgan, 56, from Brampton, Cambridgeshire, pictured after their court victory yesterday, had their address posted online

Recorder Claire Moulder ruled that by
 turning away the couple, she had ‘treated them less favourably than she
 would treat unmarried heterosexual couples’.

Mrs Wilkinson, who had previously stopped unmarried couples from sharing a bed, is considering an appeal.

Shortly afterwards, Mr Griffin 
tweeted: ‘We’ll hold a demo – for rights of all home owners, gays 
included, to rent or not rent rooms to whomsoever they wish.’

A later tweet threatened: ‘So Messrs 
Black & Morgan, at [address] a British Justice team will come up to 
Huntington [sic] & give you a ... bit of a drama by way of reminding
 you that an English couple’s home is their castle. Say No to 
heterophobia!’

Mr Griffin, an MEP for the North West region, yesterday claimed it was the public’s ‘right to discriminate’.

He told BBC Radio Five Live: ‘I was elected to speak up for the silent majority and that is what I am doing.’

Disagreement: Christians Susanne and Mike 
Wilkinson refused to let gay couple Michael Black and John Morgan share a
 room at their B&B

He added: ‘I didn’t tweet their full address, I tweeted a part of it. People have the right to discriminate.’

The use of the word ‘drama’ referred to the fact the men are involved in amateur dramatics, said Mr Griffin.

Mr Morgan, a computer consultant, 
described the tweets as ‘astonishing’. He said: ‘We are talking to 
police about prosecuting Mr Griffin.

‘Uncomfortable is probably the best word to describe how we feel about Mr Griffin’s threats.’
