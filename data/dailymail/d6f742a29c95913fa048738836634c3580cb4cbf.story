Bafetimbi Gomis' collapse had those inside White Hart Lane fearing the worst, but thankfully the Swansea striker is fine - in fact, manager Garry Monk revealed he wanted to carry on playing against Tottenham.

Hush fell on the ground where Bolton midfielder Fabrice Muamba suffered a cardiac arrest three years ago after the 29-year-old went down as play was about to restart following Nacer Chadli's wonderful, early opener.

Paramedics and medical staff raced to tend to Gomis, who left the field on a stretcher and an oxygen mask after several minutes of treatment.

Medical staff attended to the France international for four minutes before he regained consciousness 

The French striker later tweeted in French and then English, saying: 'I wanted to reassure you concerning my health , it actually looks much more scary than physically dangerous and I am feeling well now .

'I have been under a great deal of stress and fatigue due to my father health that requires me to go back and forth to France

'I was disappointed that I couldn't help my team tonight but now everything is back In order

'I also want to thank everyone for their support and get well messages .' 

Earlier in the evening, news emanated from the Swansea dressing room that it was nothing serious, with the 3-2 loss at Spurs one of several times he has fainted over his career.

'He is fine,' Swans boss Monk said. 'Coming off the pitch he was fine, talking and he actually wanted to stay on the pitch.

'It's something that we're well aware of and it's part of his history, but obviously he's had all the checks.

'We knew about this when he came to the club. He's had all the medical checks that you can possibly do and it's just part of his life. It's to do with low blood pressure.

'I didn't actually see the situation. Our physios went onto the pitch and they relayed the message but he was fine.

'Coming off the pitch, he was talking. He actually wanted to stay on the pitch but obviously precautionary wise, we have to make sure that we double check everything but we're well aware of the history.'

Monk is not sure whether Gomis, a summer acquisition from Lyon, lost consciousness or not in the incident which stems from a long-standing vasovagal condition.

'We're all well aware of it,' he said. 'He's had every single medical check that you can possibly have, and he's fine. It's just part of his life.'

Despite that knowledge, the overriding feeling was still one of relief after the incident proved far less serious than first feared. Gomis has now gone to hospital as a precautionary measure, but Monk foresees 'no problem whatsoever' with him playing their next match against Liverpool on March 16.

'We'll clarify now with the club doctor and see what we do from here, see whether we pick him up or he gets his own car back,' the Swans boss added.

Monk does not think the Gomis incident affected his players in the defeat at White Hart Lane - something backed-up by the fact Ki Sung-Yueng drew parity shortly afterwards.

Spurs went back ahead through second-half strikes from Ryan Mason and Andros Townsend, before Gylfi Sigurdsson's late effort led to a nervy ending in what Mauricio Pochettino thinks was a deserved win.

'I'm happy for the players because they deserve this victory,' the Tottenham head coach said, 'It was a very important three points for us, I'm happy for the performance, it was fantastic.

'It was 3-2 but we shoot many times and had more than 60 per cent possession - only in the last minute did we put risk in the game.

'We were lucky to have a big save from Hugo (Lloris in stoppage-time) - one of the best 'keepers in world.'

Pochettino also took time in the post-match press conference to wish Gomis a 'speedy recovery'.

'A lot of years ago I had the same problem with team mate Oscar Garcia, who was manager of Watford and Brighton,' he said.

'It's a difficult moment because it's your life. Football is not important when something happens like that.

'I was a player on the pitch and it was Oscar Garcia was my team-mate - he fell and then it was the same situation, but he was okay.'
