Alex Breier, 41, was jailed for five years and 10 months after he admitted trafficking young women into the UK to work as sex slaves in brothels

A Hungarian family has been jailed after they trafficked vulnerable girls to Britain and forced them to work as sex slaves for three years.

Alex Breier, 41, arranged for three girls to be brought to the UK and forced them to upload their images to a website for men to choose which one they wanted to abuse, a court heard.

With the help from his wife, sister, son-in-law and even his own son and daughter, he operated from brothels in Manchester, Bolton and across the North West of England.

Bolton Crown Court was told that it as only after one of the victims had enough courage to contact police that the family was tracked down and arrested. 

Brier admitted six charges - three of trafficking women into the UK and three within the UK for the purposes of prostitution and was jailed for five years and 10 months. 

The woman that exposed the prostitution ring was just 18 when she was brought to the UK in 2012 and had an unsettled upbringing in her native Hungary.

She was forced into sexual servitude aged just 15 and was beaten by pimps, who told her she would not get food and could not leave unless she worked as a prostitute.  

It was here she was introduced to Breier, who flew her to Holland where the family forced her into sex work controlled through threats, fear and violence.

She later told police how she was forced to work as a prostitute in Germany, Holland and also Belgium and felt powerless to run away.

In 2012, she and a second girl, 19, were brought by ferry to the UK and then into Manchester.

Over a period of 15 months, they were taken to numerous places in Greater Manchester and Lancashire owned by different members of the Breier family where they were forced to work as prostitutes with a third young woman, aged 18.

They worked across Manchester and in many houses including family-owned properties in Bolton and Blackburn.

All three girls were under the control of the family and were forced to upload their pictures to a website from which 'customers' could choose which girl they wanted.

Bolton Crown Court (pictured) heard that it was only after one victim had enough courage to come forward that police tracked the family down and arrested them. 

These men were then given a specific address to visit where they would be shown in through a secluded entrance and taken upstairs and paid the Breier family cash in return for sex. 

The girls rarely saw any of the money they worked for and only received basic food, shelter and cannabis.

When Alex Breier assaulted one girl in March 2014, she confided in a friend who convinced her to go to police.

A series of co-ordinated warrants took place that month, during which various members of the Breier family were rounded up and arrested.

Det Chief Insp Rick Jackson, based at Bolton, said: 'I want to paint a damning picture of exactly what Alex Breier is really like. For three years he forced women into a penniless life of sexual slavery and servitude. 

'He would beat these women if they did not obey him, controlling them physically and psychologically to the point where they felt powerless to free themselves from his violent grip.

'It is that power, that control, that makes it possible for young women to be trafficked into the UK and prostituted against their will.

'One incident really sticks in my mind. At one point, Breier told the girls he would report them to police for working as a prostitute if they did not obey him.

'It may seem astonishing but such was their fear and insecurity that this "threat" had the desired effect.

'What makes this even more galling is that the entire family conspired together to control the lives of these girls.

Breier was helped by his wife, sister, son-in-law and even his own son and daughter. Pictured is Fecitt Brown in Blackburn, where his son Kristian ran one of the brothels

'I can't begin to imagine what a nightmare existence they lived through, virtually destitute, repeatedly beaten and living day-to-day in fear.

'However, eventually one of the girls had the courage to speak up and as a result, police in Bolton, assisted by numerous agencies across Europe, have exposed this family for who they really are. 

'I would like to personally commend her for her bravery after years of living in fear. Her bravery cannot be overstated.'

He added:  'This was an extremely complex investigation which took us all over Europe and brought together the National Crime Agency, the National Referral Mechanism Human Trafficking Europol and enforcement agencies in Germany, Holland and Belgium. 

'Those involved in human trafficking often use multiple locations to avoid detection, but thanks to the dedication and sheer tenacity of the officers involved, this family has been brought to justice.

'I want to assure people living in Bolton, and the wider communities of Manchester, that there is nothing we won't do to bring human traffickers to justice.

'There is no stone we won't overturn and no country we won't go to expose these people for who they are: shameless cowards who profit by selling women into sex against their will.

'Tackling people trafficking is an absolute priority for police across Greater Manchester and right here in Bolton and we will continue to combine the efforts of partner agencies across the globe toward tackling this issue.' 

Breier's wife Alexne Breier, 43, of Bolton, pleaded guilty to conspiracy to keep a brothel used for prostitution. She was given a nine month prison sentence suspended for 12 months.

Their son Kristian Breier, 22, of  Blackburn, pleaded guilty to the same charge as his mother and was also given a nine month prison sentence suspended for 12 months.

Breier's sister, Katalin Bogdan, 39,  of  Bolton, pleaded guilty to conspiracy to keep a brothel used for prostitution. She was given a conditional discharge for 12 months.

Ferenci Baranyai, 32, partner of Katalin Bogdan, of Bolton, pleaded guilty to conspiracy to keep a brothel used for prostitution and was given a conditional discharge for 12 months.

Breier's daughter, Csabane Androvics, 24, of Bolton, pleaded guilty to conspiracy to keep a brothel used for prostitution and was given a six month sentence suspended for 12 months.
