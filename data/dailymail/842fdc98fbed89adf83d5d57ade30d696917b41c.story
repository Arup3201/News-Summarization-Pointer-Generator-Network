Raising his arm into a Usain Bolt pose, Michael Adebolajo kisses a copy of the Koran with his eyes closed.

The terror suspect went through this routine as he appeared in court yesterday accused of murdering Drummer Lee Rigby.

Stooping in the dock with a large bandage on his left arm, the 28-year-old demanded to be called ‘Abu Hamza’.

In court: Raising his arm into a Usain Bolt pose, Michael Adebolajo kisses a copy of the Koran with his eyes closed

Clutching a copy of the Koran in his right hand, Adebolajo repeatedly interrupted the hearing.

At one point he said: ‘I’m only a man.
 I would like to alleviate the pain if I may.’ Then suddenly he held his
 hands aloft and closed his eyes before kissing the Koran.

Throughout the 12-minute hearing 
Adebolajo blew kisses towards a relative in the public gallery, 
understood to be his younger brother Jeremiah.

Accused: Adebolajo is facing a murder charge

Wearing a white T-shirt and trousers, 
he remained seated when deputy chief magistrate Emma Arbuthnott entered 
Westminster Magistrates Court in London for the hearing.

When he was told to stand by the court
 clerk, he asked: ‘May I ask why?’ The defendant was then told it was a 
customary part of the court process, to which he replied: ‘Then I will 
sit’.

Addressing Adebolajo, the court clerk said: ‘I understand that you wish to be known as Mujahid Abu Hamza.’

The defendant replied: ‘That is correct.’ He was then referred to as ‘Mr Abu Hamza’ throughout the remainder of the hearing.

Adebolajo is accused of killing Drummer Rigby, 25, just yards from Woolwich army barracks in broad daylight on May 22.

Drummer Rigby, who leaves behind a two
 year-old son called Jack and a fiancée, died from multiple stab wounds 
and had to be identified by his dental records.

Unusual: Michael Adebolajo made a series of gestures in the dock at Westminster Magistrates' Court, including kissing the Koran while pointing the the sky

Hearing: Woolwich suspect Michael Adebolajo, whose left arm was heavily bandaged, refused to stand in court yesterday morning and held the Koran throughout

Gesture: Those in court said that Adebolajo apparently blew kisses to this man from the dock, the unnamed named then reportedly pointed to the sky

Adebolajo, from Romford, Essex, was 
shot by police and spent just over a week being treated for his injuries
 under armed guard in hospital.

The defendant is also charged with attempting to murder two police officers, known as E38 and D49.

He faces a fourth charge of possessing
 a 9.4mm revolver with intent to cause persons to believe that unlawful 
violence would be used against him.

Hearing:  A police van drives Michael Adebolajo into Westminster Magistrates' Court, to face charges linked to the murder of soldier Lee Rigby in Woolwich

Guard: Armed police closed off roads around the court as the prisoner was swept into the central London court

High profile: Adebolajo, 28, who was inside this van, is accused of a series of crimes linked to Drummer Rigby

Shouting from the dock in a slightly 
slurred voice, Adebolajo said: ‘May I respond please? I’m not sure I’ve 
heard those specific charges put to me like that before.’

Court case: Adebolajo  appeared to blow a kiss to this man understood to be his brother Jeremiah, who was pictured outside court

The magistrate told him it  was normal procedure for suspects to have the charges read out  to them.

To which Adebolajo replied: ‘I’ve got 
an idea, somewhere along the line a jobs-worth came up with a very 
foolish rule that a criminal, or so-called criminals, in the dock may 
not respond. For what reason?’

Mrs Arbuthnott told him that most suspects wanted to know the charges they faced.

Adebolajo replied: ‘You are  correct and I do not disagree  with that.’

As the hearing progressed Adebolajo – 
who was flanked by two plain clothes police officers and a security 
guard – suddenly seemed happy to stand up when asked.

At one point David Gottlieb, defending, told him to calm  down and said it was just a  ‘routine hearing’.

The court heard that the police have instructed a ‘world famous forensic psychologist’ to help them with their investigation.

Mark Topping, a specialist prosecutor 
from the Crown Prosecution Service’s counter terrorism division, said: 
‘The Crown says the charges are indictable only and they must be sent to
 the Central Criminal Court.’

Adebolajo was remanded into custody and 
will appear at the Old Bailey either today or tomorrow for a procedural 
hearing.

He will then appear at the same court 
on June 28 alongside Michael Adebowale, who appeared in court last week 
charged with the murder of Drummer Rigby.

Charges: Michael Adebolajo (left) and Michael Adebowale (right) are accused of murdering Lee Rigby and other related charges

Ring of steel: Armed police outside Westminster Magistrates' Court to deal with the appearance of Michael Adebolajo, 28

Police presence: Large numbers of officers were brought into Central London to guard the court while Adebolajo was inside

Tragic: Drummer Lee Rigby died in the street as he walked back to his barracks in Woolwich, but Choudary says the Koran teaches that there should be no sympathy for non-Muslims

Outside court armed officers patrolled the streets with unarmed colleagues.

Meanwhile, at a short procedural 
hearing at the Old Bailey, Adebowale, 22, was once again ordered to 
remain in custody until June 28.

Neither defendant has entered pleas to any of the charges.

Eight other people have been arrested during the investigation into Drummer Rigby’s death.

Six men, aged between 21 and 50, have been arrested on suspicion of conspiracy to murder. All have been released on police bail.

Rikki Thomas, 29, who is understood to
 be Adebolajo’s partner, and her sister, Danielle, 31, were also 
arrested last week but subsequently released.
