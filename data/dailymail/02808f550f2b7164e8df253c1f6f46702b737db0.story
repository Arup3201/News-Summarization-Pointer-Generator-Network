Arsene Wenger says Arsenal, Chelsea and Liverpool are upset at not winning the Premier League.

Manchester City all but sealed a second championship in three years by thrashing Aston Villa on Wednesday night.

The Gunners were top of the table for the most days out of any side this season but fell away when the season neared its climax.

Fell away: But Arsene Wenger says it is the other challengers who are frustrated at not winning the title

Arsenal 128

Chelsea 64

Liverpool 59

Man City 11

Man Utd 2

Speaking at his press conference ahead of the season's final game at virtually-relegated Norwich on Sunday, Wenger said: 'Every other team in the top four will be frustrated by not winning the league this year.

'We have been top 128 days but we failed in some big games in away from home.'

Arsenal were top until February, but shipping 17 goals in their three away games against the top three put paid to their status as title challengers.

Wenger, however, said that next season his side need to score more goals.

He said: 'It's been a very interesting title race. You feel Liverpool were very unlucky because they had a fantastic second half of the season.

'City and Liverpool's offensive potential has been fantastic. That's where we need to improve.'
