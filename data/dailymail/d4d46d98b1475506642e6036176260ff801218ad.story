It seems that Kim Kardashian's recent 'belfie' photo has sent women into a frenzy.

Perhaps in a desperate bid to emulate the reality TV star, women have been rushing to George
 at Asda to snap up their new 'Great Bum Briefs', which contain 
hidden pads high on the buttocks to make them appear fuller and more 
peachy.

Sales have risen 4,600 per cent 
online and 917 per cent in store this week - with size small briefs selling out in a matter 
of hours.

But do they really give you a voluptuous bottom a la J-Lo?

Layla James, 24, from took the pants for a spin around the streets of London.

Speaking about the briefs, she said: 'I have quite a big bum anyway so they don't really make that much of a difference.

'I imagine if you were a girl with one of those flat bottoms, they would really help.

'The good thing is, they feel exactly like normal pants but I would never wear them - imagine if someone groped your bum and felt all that padding...How mortifying!'.

FEMAIL asked a few passers by for their opinion on Layla's pert new derriere.

Stacey Lowndes, 25, said: 'I can 
definitely tell you're wearing some sort of padding under there. If they
 were more discreet then they'd be a welcome addition in my wardrobe.'

Karl Smith, 44, said: 'Two thumbs up from me, cracking!'.

Addie
 Lawrence, 32, added: 'You're VPL (visible panty line) is pretty obvious
 but your bum looks nice and squeezable - I'd beware if I were you!'.

George unveiled the £6 pants on the back of research which revealed that 64 per cent of the 
nation's ladies wanted help in enhancing their curves.

The study found that 52 per cent 
admitted to being unhappy about the size and shape of their bottoms and
 74 per cent admitted to wearing a padded bra on a daily basis. 

A spokesperson for Asda said: 'At
 this time of year many women are after a show-stopping outfit and with 
the trend for slimline dresses still going strong as we head into 
Christmas women are looking to their under garments to help create the 
illusion of the perfect silhouette. 

'This
 year there has been a lot of 
demand for product that not just "sucks you in" but also "pads you out" -
 it's not about losing inches anymore, but more about creating an 
amazing curvy and feminine shape.'

Shapely: Small bums were once all the rage, but singers like Jennifer Lopez are now admired for their curves

Curvy: American TV star Kim Kardashian, pictured, was also named among the top five celebrity bottoms

It is not the first time Asda has tried to cash in on the bum-enhancing craze.

The supermarket said its Great Bum and Tum Jeans became the best selling pair of jeans in its history, shifting 600 pairs in the first five hours of sale.

There are already several pairs of padded pants on the market, with Spanx booty boosting shorts getting the biggest thumbs-up from our Femail writers earlier this year.

But at £72 a pop, they won't leave much change in the back pocket to do the 'Asda price' spank.
