Tory chairman Grant Shapps has been accused of changing entries on his Wikipedia page to make it read more favourably.

Among the deletions are references to his school results and a section on political gaffes.

The online encyclopedia had reported details of his time at Watford grammar school, saying he had ‘obtained four O-levels including an A in CDT (Craft, Design and Technology)’.

In its place, Mr Shapps, 43, inserted a glowing testimony to his ‘influential’ work on homelessness.

Mr Shapps, who took over as Tory party
 chairman last week, also deleted a Wikipedia passage referring to 
donations to his office while he was shadow housing minister.

The original entry read that in May 
2008 he had ‘taken large donations from companies related to his 
frontbench portfolio’ and that this was ‘potentially damaging for Mr 
Shapps given the extent of the donations’.

The amounts were said to have run into
 ‘tens of thousands of pounds’ and had been from mortgage brokers, an 
estate agent and a firm of solicitors.

His side: Mr Shapps, 43, justified the edits, saying he removed politically biased or unreferenced edits and claiming 'content must be verifiable'

Mr Shapps sent a letter to the 
parliamentary commissioner in 2008 admitting a potential conflict of 
interest. Sources say the reference to the donations was deleted from 
Wikipedia because many of them were set up by his predecessor Michael 
Gove.

Another passage deleted by Mr Shapps 
referred to ‘media attention for a number of gaffes during his time on 
the Conservative frontbench’.

It is the second brush Mr Shapps has 
had with an internet company in the past few days. It was reported over 
the weekend that Google had blacklisted a network of websites run by Mr 
Shapps’s family for breaching rules on copyright infringement, but this 
has been denied by a spokesman.

The MP is said to have used a pseudonym – Michael Green – to set up and promote a company that broke Google’s rules.

Education: He is said to have deleted details about his time at Watford Grammar School for Boys, where the website claimed he 'obtained four O-levels'

The business HowToCorp sells software 
which increases a website’s advertising revenue by using content from 
other sites. Mr Shapps is no longer named on the firm’s documents.

Mr Shapps last night told the Mail he 
had not touched the Wikipedia site for years. He said: ‘If it was a 
vanity exercise then I certainly wouldn’t have got rid of a Wiki claim 
that I received an A in Craft, Design & Technology – sadly for me, I
 only achieved a B.

‘Everyone knows I’m not in the least 
bit embarrassed about my schooling and I am proud to live in a country 
where people can succeed regardless of their background. But these days 
when I see stuff that’s blatantly wrong on my Wiki page, I just shrug my
 shoulders. If people want to claim I’m a Jehovah’s Witness, agnostic or
 crashed a car into a school wall – all real edits I’d previously 
changed – then I just leave them to it.’

Wikipedia has more than 3.3million 
English language articles. Anyone with web access can edit its pages, 
but those who register as editors can do so under a pseudonymous 
username.
