The search continues for a missing Texas mother-of-three, who disappeared from her home with her purse and cell phone. 

Danielle Sleeper, 32, was last seen by her husband on the morning of March 22. 

He told authorities his wife was asleep when he left their home in Magnolia. 

The search continues for missing mother-of-three Danielle Sleeper, 32, who was last seen by her husband sleeping in their home in Magnolia, Texas on the morning of March 22 

When he returned in the afternoon she was gone, although her vehicle was still parked outside. 

Sleeper's father, Charles Street, said it's not like his daughter to 'just start walking on foot and just leave'. 

'I don't know. Maybe she got scared or something,' he told ABC 13. 

Sleeper, a stay-at-home mother of three boys, also does not have her medication, which she takes for seizures.

Her mother, Dina Street, said she became concerned when Sleeper didn't text or call her back that Sunday. 

'She lives on that phone,' Dina Street told KHOU. 

The phone has since been turned off. 

Dina Street said her daughter would never just leave her boys behind. 

'She would not just walk away,' she said. 

'She just loves people and she just loves communicating with them.' 

But she had a message for Sleeper, just in case her daughter did leave of her own free will.

'I'm tearing my heart out and your dad and your sister are just beside themselves,' Street said. 

Sleeper's purse and cell phone were also gone, but her car was still parked in the driveway. The mother's medication, which she takes for seizures, was also left behind 

'We've got everybody and their brother looking for you. Please let us know where you are.' 

Sleeper's sister, Tannah Cross, also had words for Danielle. 

'I just want you to come home,' she said. 'If you're safe and you're out there, just come home.' 

But Cross believes something's 'not right'. 

'This is not her, this is not normal,' she told Click2Houston. 

'She is a loving mom who is always around her kids.' 

'This is what she gets up in the morning for. That is why I know this is not right.' 

Search and rescue organization EquuSearch have enlisted a helicopter, ATVS and more than 150 volunteers in addition to family members to help search for Sleeper.
