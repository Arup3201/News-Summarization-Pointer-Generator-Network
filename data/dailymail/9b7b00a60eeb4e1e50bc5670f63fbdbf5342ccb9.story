A former soldier who battered his wife to death with a dumbbell after hiring a detective to expose her affair has been jailed for at least 17 years today.

Nirmal Gill, 49, who killed wife Rosemary Gill, 48, in the bedroom of their Bristol home in the early hours of July 20 last year, was handed a life sentence at Bristol Crown Court.

The killer beat her to death because he could not accept she wanted to 'move on and have a life without him', the jury was told.

Gill, showing no emotion, was jailed for life by Judge Neil Ford QC, the Recorder of Bristol, who told him he would serve a minimum of 17 years.

'You brutally bludgeoned your wife Rosemary to death, using a heavy dumbbell bar which you had taken from the hallway of your home and carried upstairs to her bedroom,' the judge said.

'You did so because your marriage was disintegrating. You wanted the relationship to continue but Rosemary in her own words 'no longer had anything to give'.

'She had begun to find happiness with another man and she had kept that a secret from you and your children.'

Bristol Crown Court was told 'possessive' Gill had become suspicious of his wife’s behaviour and contracted a team to watch her movements.

The firm fitted a tracking device to Mrs Gill’s Audi and regularly sent text updates of her location to Gill - who followed her in his own and borrowed cars.

Eventually, he spotted his wife kissing and embracing her ex-husband Andrew Cooper.

Three days later, he carried out the 'revenge' attack - using a metal dumbbell to strike his wife in the head at least 12 times.

Mrs Gill’s naked and bloody body was discovered eight hours later by the couple’s daughter, Jasmine, 19, who had been sleeping in the room next door.

Gill, who joined the regulars and served in Germany in 1985, admitted the manslaughter of his wife through a loss of control but denied murder. He claimed he could not remember the fatal event after taking a cocktail of prescription drugs and alcohol.

The court heard the couple's 24-year marriage hit the rocks early last year, with arguments sparked by money troubles, and began to sleep separately.

Rosemary sought solace in the arms of Mr Cooper, a lorry driver, to whom she was married between 1982 and 1986. They quickly began an intimate relationship and planned to move out together.

In June last year she told Gill, father of her two children Zac and Jasmine, she wanted a divorce in June, contacted a solicitor to start the proceedings, and suggested he move in with his mother.

But furious Gill became suspicious and paid a private investigator to attach a tracking device to his wife’s Audi.

On July 17, he followed her and spotted her kissing Mr Cooper - her husband of four years - at a secret meeting at Gordano service area on the M5 outside Bristol.

Two days later, on July 19, Gill agreed to separate from his wife during a discussion about their future at a local pub.

'She
 said, "I have been your mother, not your lover, for 24 years",' he 
said. 'I was absolutely devastated, it was like my whole world was 
crumbling in front of my eyes.'

Mrs Gill returned home at 10pm, texting Mr Cooper.

But at around 3am neighbours reported hearing banging noises.

She had at least a dozen 'blunt force' injuries to the top and back of her head, which caused multiple fractures to her skull and fatal brain injuries.

The father-of-two remained emotionless as the jury of nine men and three women returned their unanimous verdict to the single charge after two hours of deliberations.

Gill told the jury he had attempted suicide that evening by taking paracetamol, prescription drugs, two cans of lager and up to half a bottle of vodka.

'He brought about the death of his wife but he has also destroyed the relationship with his children'

He claimed he spotted his wife’s bedroom light was on after getting up to use the bathroom in the early hours of July 20.

'She said "Nirmal, what are you doing?",' Gill told the jury. 'She called me into the room.

'We started to cuddle and I was unable to get an erection. I remember Rosemary laughing at me and calling me a sad, sad, pathetic man.

'I just remember hitting Rosemary with the bar.'

Forensic examinations found Mrs Gill had been clothed during the attack, with her underwear later ripped from her body.

Gill later told police he had attempted to have sex with his wife 20 minutes after her death, but was not successful.

In mitigation for Gill, Henry Grunwald QC described the murder as 'a tragic case for all concerned'.

He said a victim impact statement written by Zac on behalf of the couple’s children spoke of their double loss.

'The loss that they feel, not only the loss of their mother but the effective loss of their father,' he said.

'He brought about the death of his wife but he has also destroyed the relationship with his children.

'He can only hope that in the years to come he can rebuild a relationship with them.'

Mr Grunwald said evidence from two psychiatrists showed Gill had been suffering from a mental disorder at the time of the murder.

'It is only in the state that he was in at the time this offence was committed that it was committed,' he said.
