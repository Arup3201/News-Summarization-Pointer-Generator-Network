A set of fingerprints left on a holiday greeting card in the back of a Florida woman's car have led police to the man accused of kidnapping her Christmas Day and forcing her to withdraw money from ATMs so he could buy drugs.

Daniel Palomares, 23, has been charged in the abduction of 22-year-old Olivia Gordon, from Orlando, at a Walgreens pharmacy on December 25.

Gordon told police Palomares jumped into the passenger seat of her car after seeing her emerge from Walgreens dressed in a Batman T-shirt and yellow cape, and made it clear to her that he had a gun.

Christmas Day abduction: Gordon was kidnapped upon existing this Walgreen pharmacy in Orlando 

Criminal on the prowl: A man believed to be Palomares (seen here in surveillance video) jumped into Gordon's car in the parking lot of the drug store and threatened her with a gun  

As she drove away from the drug store parking lot, Palomares emptied her wallet of cash. He found more money inside a Christmas card, which he then unwittingly tossed in the backseat of her car, reported WKMG. 

Police say the 23-year-old then forced Gordon to take him to Blossom Park Condominiums, where he purchased drugs in front of her.

He ordered the woman to take him to the Florida Mall parking lot, where he got high and dozed off.

Gordon used the opportunity to try and escape, but Palomares woke up, grabbed her by the shoulders and threatened to shoot her, according to police. 

Palomares then had his captive drive to a Bank of America to withdraw money from an ATM, followed by a trip to a Wells Fargo bank 12 miles away where she took out even more cash.

According to a police report, Gordon later picked Daniel Palomares from a photo lineup, reported WESH-TV.

On December 31, Palomares was arrested in connection to an unrelated incident in which he allegedly tried to shoplift a cart full of clothes, a television and a PlayStation 3 from the Super Target near the Mall of Millenia.

The 23-year-old was at the Orange County Jail on theft charges when the fingerprints found on Olivia Gordon's Christmas card came back a match this week.

Mr Palomares, a car wash employee from Palm Bay, is now facing charges of kidnapping with a firearm and three counts of robbery.

Palomares has a lengthy criminal record, including six counts of grand theft and trafficking in stolen property stemming from an arrest last July. He had been placed on probation through July 2019.
