Former Gossip Girl actress Kelly Rutherford burst into tears outside of a Manhattan federal courthouse Wednesday after losing her 11th-hour legal bid to keep her two children in the U.S.

Rutherford, 45, has been locked in a battle to prevent her son and daughter from being sent back to France, where they live with her ex-husband, Daniel Giersch.

The children are scheduled to get on a plane to return to their father next Tuesday.

Major setback: Kelly Rutherford, pictured here with her son and daughter in the latest issue of Hamptons magazine, was dealt a major blow Wednesday when a federal judge refused to step in to prevent the children from being sent back to their father in France

This morning, Ms Rutherford appealed to a federal judge in Manhattan asking him to keep her children with her, but Judge Andrew Carter Jr responded that he did not have jurisdiction to step in and overrule a California judge who made a decision in the custody case in 2012.

Following the hearing, Kelly Rutherford was seen sobbing in reaction to the ruling.

'My own country won't save my children, and I pay taxes!' she exclaimed outside the courthouse, according to TMZ. Rutherford, however, still has one more chance to keep her children in the country.

The federal judge assigned to the case scheduled a conference call Friday with the actress, her ex-husband and his attorney to try and work out a way for Mr Giersch to live in the U.S.

Giersch, who is a German citizen residing in France, was deported from the U.S. over allegations of visa fraud.

If this final effort fails, Rutherford’s children will be put on a plane en route to France next Tuesday. 

After the emotional court hearing, Rutherford complained that her children, 7-year-old Hermes and 5-year-old Helena, who are American citizens, are being essentially deported from their home country while she is being forced to pay taxes to support the parents of children 'who illegally crossed our borders,' according to Page Six. 

She added that something like this could have never happened anywhere else, especially not in Germany.

Bittersweet: Kelly's two children have been spending their summer vacation with mom in New York. But they are supposed to return to their father Daniel Griesch next Tuesday. Kelly had petitioned the federal government to allow the children to stay in the US claiming they had been deported to France illegally in the first place

Judge 
Carter responded to Rutherford’s claims by stating that her son and 
daughter are not being deported in the official sense, meaning that 
their constitutional rights are not being violated, Page Six reported. 

Meanwhile, RadarOnline revealed  Wednesday evening that the former Gossip Girl star could face 
kidnapping charges if she fails to return her two children to their 
father as required under the 2012 custody decision.

Giersch's
 legal team is said to be furious at Rutherford and her continued 
machinations to keep her children in the U.S. - especially in light of 
the fact that the father of two allegedly paid for his ex-wife’s trips 
to France.

Rutherford's
 efforts were dealt a blow by a memorandum handed down yesterday by 
Attorney General Eric Holder and Director of Homeland Security Jeh 
Johnson.

They
 slapped down the Gossip Girl star's August 5 petition, which claimed 
that the children had been illegally deported by a California court. 
They have been here with her on summer holiday.  

In its filing, the recommendation of Holder and Johnson read, in part: The Court should decline Petitioners’ request that the United States take custody of them [the children] for the following reasons:

(1) no subject matter jurisdiction exists over the Petition for Writ of Mandamus because the Respondents have no mandatory duty to take custody of Petitioners; (2) no subject matter jurisdiction exists because sovereign immunity bars the Court from requiring the Respondents to take custody of Petitioners; (3) no subject matter jurisdiction exists because Petitioners have not been deported and fail to raise a federal question.

A California court ruled two years ago that the children 
should live in France with ex-husband Daniel Griesch.

Wendy Murphy, Rutherford's attorney, told MailOnline: 'Kelly has no intention of violating the California judge's order.

'This
 is about Kelly's children and their civil rights. This legal action is 
the only way for the children to enforce their rights as U.S. citizens.

'No
 person, especially an American child, should be forced to leave the 
United States unless a federal authority makes that decision in a manner
 consistent with the Constitution.

'That
 did not happen with Kelly's children and we are simply asking a federal
 authority to make a decision consistent with the children's fundamental
 rights as Americans.'

The
 court documents seen by MailOnline are the latest twist in a bitter 
battle that has gone on since Rutherford, 45, and Griesch, 39, a German 
businessman, divorced in 2010 after four years of marriage.

It has 
left Rutherford emotionally exhausted, desperate and having filed for 
bankruptcy with $2million in debt after spending all her earnings from 
Gossip Girl on legal fees and flights to France to see her children.

MailOnline revealed last week that Rutherford had filed a lawsuit at the Federal Appeals 
Court of the Southern District of New York in Manhattan on behalf of 
herself and her children.

She sued the U.S. government, including Attorney General Holder and 
Jeh Johnson, Secretary of the Department of Homeland Security, because 
she claims that an earlier ruling by a California Superior Court judge 
that her children should live in France was unlawful. Only federal 
courts can deal with matters of deportation. she argues.

She
 wanted the US District Court in New York court to grant her ‘temporary 
emergency authority’ over her children and an order saying the previous 
ruling was ‘unconstitutional’.

Marriage woes: Kelly left Daniel Giersch in 2009 while she was pregnant with their second child after the German businessman's visa was revoked. A judge awarded him custody of the children in 2012

In strong language, Rutherford said it amounted to an ‘illegal deportation’.

The
 lawsuit stated: ‘Emergency relief is necessary because the children are
 currently physically located in New York, but they are required to 
return to France on August 19, 2014…

‘...the children are left with no option but to seek relief from this court because there is no alternative means by which they can obtain a legal remedy allowing them to remain in their own country’.

The lawsuit says the case is ‘highly unusual’ and raises the possibility of Rutherford breaking the law to ensure that her children stay in the US.

It states that children’s ‘only hope of obtaining relief from this court would be to have their mother retain them in the United States, in violation of California order…

‘...Such an option would deny the children a meaningful remedy and expose the mother and the children to unjust punishment’.

Holding tight: Kelly will be devastated if her children have to fly back to her ex on Tuesday. She's spent all her earning fighting the California custody order and flying to see them

Rutherford has also demanded that steps be taken to see if Giersch could be given a visa to enter the U.S. to see his children.

The only 
reason the current arrangements were decided as such was because he 
cannot enter the U.S., allegedly because he lied to get a visa in the 
past.

Rutherford,
 who played Blake Lively's mother in Gossip Girl, has custody of her 
children 50 per cent of the time but they live and go to school in 
France.

But the real issue is the rancor between the two sides, which has never been resolved.

According 
to court documents obtained by TMZ, trust broke down between the pair so
 badly that Rutherford hired a private eye to spy on Giersch 'in 
relation to certain issues regarding child custody and other matters'.

Soon
 after the birth of their daughter, who was born after they split, 
Giersch put out a statement which said: 'I was never informed by Kelly 
about the birth of our daughter, nor was I invited to attend.

'In
 fact, I found out about it through Internet reports like everyone else.
 Although this sickens me, I am of course overjoyed that our baby was 
born healthy.

'I would’ve wanted nothing more than to hold our newborn daughter for a few moments, and I only seek to co-parent both our children responsibly and with love.'
