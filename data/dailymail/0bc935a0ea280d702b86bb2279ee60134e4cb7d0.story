With convenient timing, Liverpool agreed on Saturday an £8.5million fee with QPR for French World Cup striker Loic Remy at the same time they were playing their first match on English soil since selling Luis Suarez to Barcelona.

Manager Brendan Rodgers will now hope the deal can be concluded in time for Remy to play the majority of the club’s pre-season tour of America, which begins next weekend.

Rodgers will hope with Remy and Ricky Lambert added to the squad, the 31 goals Suarez scored last season will be replaced.

On the move: Liverpool have given permission to speak to QPR striker Loic Remy after the clubs agreed a fee

Relegated: Remy was unable to stop QPR being relegated from the Premier League in 2012-13

Pedigree: Remy spent last season on loan at Newcastle, scoring 14 goals for the Magpies

Remy enjoyed a successful loan spell in the top flight with Newcastle United last season.

Boyhood Liverpool fan Lambert, who was released by them at 15, made his debut in yesterday’s 2-1 win at Preston.

The contest was rendered meaningless by an avalanche of substitutions that saw a total of 47 players used.

But
 it was still a proud moment for 32-year-old Lambert to pull on the red 
shirt of his local club and he admitted afterwards: ‘It was hard keeping
 the emotions in check.’

Fellow
 new boy Emre Can limped off only 21 minutes into his first game but 
manager Brendan Rodgers insisted it was nothing serious for the 
£10million midfielder signed from Bayer Leverkusen.

‘It
 was precautionary. One of our objectives for the game was to develop 
our fitness levels and it was important not to get any injuries,’ said 
Rodgers.

‘He felt a 
tightness. He hasn’t pulled anything and at this stage of pre-season 
there’s no point in risking anything so he came off and seems fine.’

Reinforcements: Liverpool are short of cover following the sale of Luis Suarez to Barcelona

Options: Remy will compete with Rickie Lambert and Daniel Sturridge

Partnership: Sturridge struck up an excellent understanding with Suarez

Preparation: Brendan Rodgers is trying to build a side ready to compete in the Champions League

Preston’s promising youngster Josh Brownhill, watched by Arsenal, put the home side ahead on the stroke of half-time.

But two of Liverpool’s many substitutes Suso and Kristoph Peterson turned the result around in the last 20 minutes.

A
 surprise inclusion was striker Fabio Borini. Liverpool have agreed to 
sell him to Sunderland and the Italian is still discussing personal 
terms.
