New Jersey Governor Chris Christie has defended putting a nurse in quarantine for three days - in what she claims was a violation of her human rights - to protect residents from Ebola.

Christie and New York Governor Andrew Cuomo were sharply criticized for ordering mandatory quarantines when Kaci Hickox, 33, complained that she was held against her will after returning to the U.S. from West Africa, even though she did not show any symptoms of the illness.

But Christie has maintained he did the right thing.

'My first responsibility is to protect the public health and safety of the people of New Jersey,' Christie said on Today on Tuesday morning.

'I will not submit to any political pressure to do anything I believe is less than necessary.'

He said that, despite criticisms, the state would not be changing its protocol. 

'We're trying to be careful here,' he said. 'This is common sense... We're not moving an inch... Our policy has not changed. Our policy will not change.'

He said that the CDC was now changing its 'incredibly confusing' policies to match with his state's.

His comments came as Hickox left the New Jersey hospital and arrived at an undisclosed location in Maine, where her partner is a nursing student at the University of Maine at Fort Kent. She now faces quarantine in Maine.

Battle: Nurse Kaci Hickox, 33, said being forced into quarantine in New Jersey was 'inhumane'

But one of Hickox's lawyers, Steve Hyman, said he expected her to remain in seclusion for the 'next day or so' while he works with Maine health officials.

She was the first person forced into New Jersey's mandatory quarantine for people arriving at Newark Liberty from three West African countries.

She threatened to sue the state for placing her in an unheated, 15ft x 20ft isolation tent with no working toilet in the University Hospital parking lot in Newark. 

He said he believes the state should follow the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention guidelines that require only monitoring, not quarantine, for health care workers who show no symptoms after treating Ebola patients.

'She's a very good person who did very good work and deserves to be honored, not detained, for it,' he said.

Hickox, who was expected home Tuesday morning, volunteered in Africa with Doctors Without Borders.

She spent the weekend in a quarantine tent in New Jersey despite having no symptoms other than a slightly elevated temperature she blamed on 'inhumane' treatment at Newark Liberty International Airport.

This came although Hickox said she never had symptoms and tested negative for Ebola in a preliminary evaluation. She left New Jersey in a private vehicle on Monday.

On Monday, CDC director Dr Thomas Frieden announced a voluntary quarantine for health workers returning from West Africa, encouraging them to avoid public transport and undergo daily check-ups at home. 

In Maine, state officials also announced a quarantine. 

'Upon the healthcare workers' return home, we will follow the guidelines set by the U.S. Centers for Disease Control for medical workers who have been in contact with Ebola patients,' Governor Paul LePage said in a statement.

'Additionally, we will work with the healthcare worker to establish an in-home quarantine protocol to ensure there is no direct contact with other Mainers until the period for potential infection has passed.'

But state officials said later clarified it was only a voluntary quarantine.

'We fully expect individuals to voluntarily comply with an in-home quarantine,' LePage spokeswoman Adrienne Bennett said Monday. 'If an individual is not compliant, the state is prepared to take appropriate action.'

Bennett did not immediately say what 'appropriate action' might be.

In Fort Kent, Northern Maine Medical Center is ready to care for an Ebola-infected patient, if necessary, a spokeswoman said. 

Hickox and her partner, Ted Wilbur, had moved recently to Fort Kent, where Wilbur is a senior nursing student, family members said.

WAGM-TV said Wilbur was given the choice of staying on campus in student housing over the next few weeks or temporarily suspending classes to stay with Hickox in his off-campus home during the quarantine period. A University of Maine system spokesman said he couldn't confirm details of discussions with Wilbur.

Wilbur's uncle Tom Wilbur said that Hickox should be trusted to make good decisions and that medical decisions should be grounded in science and not 'hysteria.'

'She's very much a professional,' he said. 'And she's very bright. And if she were running a fever, she would be the first to take action.'

Nina Pham: The 26-year-old Texas Health nurse, was declared Ebola-free on Friday at the National Institutes of Health in Bethesda, Maryland. She will now return to Texas with her family and be reunited with her dog Bentley. She thanked doctors, family and the country for their 'prayers, hope and love' during her recovery. Her dog Bentley was declared Ebola-free earlier this week

Amber Vinson: The 29-year-old colleague of Miss Pham was given the all-clear on Wednesday from the virus. She was being treated at Emory University Hospital in Atlanta, Georgia

Ashoka Mukpo: The NBC cameraman, 33, was given the all-clear on Tuesday at Nebraska Medical Center after being diagnosed with Ebola last month. He said that his greatest fear about dying from Ebola was leaving behind his beloved fiancee.

Unidentified man: An Ebola patient who was being treated at Emory since early September was released earlier this week.  The man was released Sunday from Atlanta's Emory University Hospital, after he was determined to be free of the virus and no threat to the public. WHO disclosed that a doctor who had been working in an Ebola treatment center in Sierra Leone had been evacuated out of Africa when he tested positive for the disease.

Thomas Eric Duncan: The Liberian man, 42, was the first case of Ebola to be diagnosed on U.S. soil. He was hospitalized on September 28 after initially being sent home from Texas Presbyterian Hospital. He died on October 8.

Dr Rick Sacra: The doctor who has spent a great deal of the last two decades as a missionary in Africa, contracted Ebola while treating Ebola patients. Dr Sacra, from Massachusetts was declared disease-free and released on September 25 after weeks of treatment at an Omaha, Nebraska, hospital

Nancy Writebol: The missionary worker contracted Ebola in July and was flown from Liberia to Emory in Atlanta. She recovered several weeks later and was declared disease-free although has said she is still working to rebuild her strength. 

Dr Kent Brantly: The doctor contracted Ebola around the same time as his colleague, Nancy Writebol. Both he and Mrs Writebol received the experimental serum Z-Mapp. He was also declared Ebola free and has given multiple blood and plasma donations to help subsequent Ebola patients. 

Dr Craig Spencer: The 33-year-old Doctors Without Borders volunteer was the first person to be diagnosed in New York City. The medic was currently being monitored in Bellevue Hospital after being rushed from his Harlem home on Thursday . His fiancee Morgan Dixon and two friends are being monitored after their contact with him. His treatment to date has been undisclosed and his condition is said to be stable.
