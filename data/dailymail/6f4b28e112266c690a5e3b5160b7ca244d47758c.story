Trevor Howard, 62, suffered more than 100 bite wounds after he tried to protect his springer spaniel from a pack of dogs

A dog walker   had part of his ear ripped off and flesh torn from his hands and arms after he was set upon by three vicious mastiffs.

Trevor Howard, 62, suffered more than 100 bite wounds after he tried to protect his springer spaniel Jess who was killed by the snarling pack.

Incredibly, mastiffs owner Yvonne Singh, 46, was allowed to walk free from court this week with a suspended sentence after admitting she was in charge of three dogs that were dangerously out of control.

Judge Robin Onions praised the bravery of Mr Howard who used himself as a human shield for dog Jess as he saw the pack approach.

'As soon as he saw them coming he knew what was going to happen,' said Judge Onions. 

'With considerable bravery, he lay himself over his own dog as a shield. He was bitten on the arms, hands and body and lost part of his ear.

'Doctors said he had been bitten more than 100 times.'

Mr Howard, from Bushbury, Wolverhampton in the West Midlands, told how he and his wife Carol were set upon by the three snarling devil dogs which were in 'attack mode'.

'I don't have to close my eyes,' he said. 'I still see the whole thing.

'We were walking when I heard a sound like the baying of hounds and they came round the corner. The Bull Mastiff was in attack mode.

'I picked Jess up and leaned forward, pressing her between my stomach and thighs, but her rump and head were sticking out. The more I bent over her, the more they ripped at me to get to her.

'I didn't feel the pain. I was just sickened to see the terror in the face of our dog.

'My wife was bitten a couple of times. Then a passer-by said he would try to find the owner. Three young lads in hoodies came along and pulled the dogs off us.

The 62-year-old, who said he will never have another dog, was rescued by three boys in hoodies who helped pull off the vicious mastiffs

'I was very lucky but we will never have another dog.'

Despite his brave actions, Jess suffered appalling injuries and had to be put to sleep six days after the attack on April 10 last year.

Singh, of Fordhouses, Wolverhampton, had been looking after the dogs when she let them out the house without checking the garden gate was secure, the court heard.

The jobless mum-of-three was was handed a four-month prison sentence, suspended for two years at Wolverhampton Crown Court and ordered to carry out 150 hours of unpaid work. She was also banned from keeping dogs for seven years and told to pay Mr Howard £500 compensation.

The three dogs, a Bull Mastiff and two French Mastiffs, were ordered to be destroyed.

Oliver Woodhouse, defending, said: 'The dogs are powerful but not prohibited animals.

'Her error of judgement in omitting to check the security of the gate had consequences which she deeply regrets.'
