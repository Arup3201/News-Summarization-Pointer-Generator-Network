An American Airlines flight made an emergency landing on Thursday after smoke filled the cabin and a 'loud bang' was reported by passengers who included a Congressman and his wife.

Flight 3454 left Tallahassee, Florida at 8.30pm en route to Miami but was forced to land in Tampa instead, according to the airline.

Among the passengers on board was Miami-Dade Schools Superintendent Alberto Carvalho who live-tweeted from the plane: 'AA3454 Landed in Tampa after lengthy maintenance delay in Tally and explosion and smoke forced a tense aggressive emergency landing. Safe.'

passengers including Congressman Mario Diaz-Balart and his wife Tia.

Mr Carvalho told Local 10: 'We heard a loud bang. I didn't see the smoke, but smelled smoke and the folks in the 
front, once we landed [they] told me that they saw smoke... shortly thereafter the flight attendants,Â in a rather distressed 
way, announced to the passengers that they were going to go in for an 
emergency landing.

Fire trucks and emergency medical services were already on scene when the plane landed at 9.30pm in Tampa.

American Airlines spokeswoman Laura Masvidal told CBS there was a smell of smoke, but she was not aware of an explosion. An FAA investigation is underway.
