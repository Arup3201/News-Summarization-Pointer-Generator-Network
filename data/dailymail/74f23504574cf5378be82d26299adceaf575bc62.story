Three thugs who opened fire on an unmarked police car while hunting down rival gang members in a turf war were jailed for a total of almost 37 years.

Ricardo Miles, 21, Daniel Ikumelo, 23, and Adebola Alimi, 22, cycled through the streets of Hackney, east London, armed with a gun while searching for enemies in a bitter feud.

When the police car pulled up alongside the trio, Miles fired the Colt .45 revolver at the officers.

Fortunately none of the officers were harmed as the bullet hit the ground in front of the vehicle.

Miles tried a second time to fire at the police but the weapon jammed. He then pointed it threateningly at the officers.

PC Richard Gilbert, who was in the car, put the vehicle into reverse as Miles continued to point the gun at them before the gang cycled away.

CCTV footage showed the three males 
firing at the car. The trio, said to be affiliated with the 
Certified Southwold Road gang in Hackney, then abandoned their bikes and
threw away the weapon before fleeing over a footbridge on January 10, 
2012.

Ikemulo also dropped an open-lock knife at the scene, less than half a mile from the Olympic Park.

The colt .45 revolver was found with 
six rounds, two fired and four live rounds in it unfired. The judge concluded that the other fired round was a practice shot some weeks beforehand.

They attempted to remove gunshot residue from their bodies later that night by entering a sauna in Kentish Town.

They were arrested in May 2012 after a long police investigation.

Snaresbrook Crown Court heard they were hunting down members of the rival Gilpin Square Gang when the officers approached.

Sentenced: Daniel Ikumelo was given 11 years and 11 months for his role in the 'joint enterprise'

All three were found guilty of possessing a colt calibre revolver with the intent to endanger life, possessing ammunition and possessing a knife following a trial.

Judge Neil Sanders, passing sentence, said: 'There was no lawful reason for you to have that weapon.

'There was a real risk of injury to not only the police officers but also residents as this was done in a residential area.

'Here, the intention was to endanger life and to use the weapon when the occasion rose as demonstrated by when it was fired in the context of gang rivalry.

'You three were associated to the Certified Southwould Road gang and set out to attack members of a rival gang.

'I assess you all to be dangerous. This was clearly a joint enterprise and you knew what weapons to use and if they were available.

'Happily no injuries were caused to anybody on this occasion.'

Peter Rowlands, defending Miles, said:
'He is not a hardened criminal. As a young boy at school he was doing 
well and has quite a substantial record of achievement.

'If you look at the reports it gives 
you an insight into Miles that he is still a young man of promise and is
devoted to his family.'

Alistair Fell, defending Ikumelo, 
said: 'This is somebody who has demonstrated commitment to his family 
and has had a positive impact on younger family members.

'He is fortunate to still have the support of his family and he is still a young man at only 22.

'There was an intervening event when 
he was the victim of a stabbing and this had significant impact on his 
development. Prior to that incident he was not known to the courts.'

Arlette Piercey, defending Alimi, 
said: 'He has found it difficult to come to terms with the jury's 
verdict and still thinks the jury got it wrong.

'He became a father at 17 and did not 
shy from those responsibilities but instead became very involved, taking
her to school every day before working at night.

'The mother of the daughter does not think seeing Alimi in custody is a place for a child and so she has cut off ties with him.'

Alimi, who came to this country aged six, is not a UK citizen and faces deportation.

Miles, of Enfield, received 13 years 
for possessing a firearm and ammunition with intent to endanger life and
one year concurrently for having an offensive weapon.

Ikumelo, of Islington was given 11 
years and 11 months for possession a firearm and ammunition with intent 
to endanger life and one year concurrently for having an offensive 
weapon.

Alimi, of Hackney, was sentenced to 12
years for possession of a firearm and ammunition with intent to 
endanger life and one year concurrently for having an offensive weapon.
