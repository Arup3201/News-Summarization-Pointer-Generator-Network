Arizona State University is severing all ties with a fraternity following a 'racist' Martin Luther King Jr Day party where guests were photographed wearing sports jerseys, flashing gang 
signs and drinking out of carved watermelons.

The school said in a statement on Thursday that it has notified Tau Kappa Epsilon its recognition as a fraternity chapter at ASU has been permanently revoked.

This means the 65-year-old local chapter is no longer affiliated with ASU, the group won't be listed on the university's website and it cannot recruit members or hold on-campus meetings.

Tau Kappa Epsilon was placed on probation in 2012 and then suspended for hosting the party on January 19, while ASU investigated.

Meanwhile, civil-rights leaders demanded the university expel the fraternity, following the party which asked guests to 'dress like black people'.

University officials said they still are investigating the event and deciding how to handle individual cases of student discipline.

Alex Baker, a spokesman for the national fraternity organization, said Tau Kappa Epsilon has received the university's findings and planned to release the results of its own investigation shortly.

Baker previously said the group does not condone racist or discriminatory behaviour.

Pictures from the party made their way onto social media websites, depicting guests dressed in basketball jerseys, flashing gang signs and holding cups carved out of watermelons.

The Rev. Jarrett Maupin, an Arizona civil rights activist, who reportedly learned of the events from an African-American student among the guests, said the party antics were outrageous and offensive.

He described the fraternity members' conduct as an exercise in 'advanced racism' and suggested they had 'intentionally' wanted to cause offence.

Maupin said: ‘I don't think this was a sense of ignorance, I think it was purposeful and intentionally hurtful and they put into play, quote 'MLK Black Party' and not in a way to honor King.’

He called for the school to expel all students involved and permanently ban the fraternity from affiliation with ASU.

Founded in 1899 at Illinois Wesleyan University in Bloomington, Ill., the fraternity has about 257,000 members at 291 chapters and colonies across the United States and Canada, according to its website.

In 2012, the University of Arizona stripped its local chapter of Tau Kappa Epsilon of recognition after an investigation showed multiple instances of dangerous hazing.
