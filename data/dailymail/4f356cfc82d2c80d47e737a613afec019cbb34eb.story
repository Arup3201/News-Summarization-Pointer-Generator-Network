Even on the front line of a perilous conflict, Anderson Cooper remains prolific in his tweets - and no less sharp-tongued.

The CNN anchor is constantly updating followers as he remains on the Gaza frontline of the escalating Israeli-Palestinian conflict today.

His reporting has been criticized by some Twitter users. One follower Pamela Weiss told Cooper to 'report a fair story' and write about rockets being fired from Gaza as well as Israeli air strikes.Â 

Cooper responded to self-described 'foodie' Mrs Weiss: 'Perhaps spend less time tweeting about coconut flan and more time actually following the news.'

Sharp words: Anderson Cooper had short shrift for some Twitter users who criticized his reporting of the Israeli-Gaza conflict

Burn! Anderson Cooper had this Twitter exchange with Pamela Weiss while he covered developments in the Israeli-Palestinian conflict

Sweet revenge: Cooper picked out this tweet to give Pamela Weiss some sass following her criticism of his Middle East reporting

The journalist engaged in another spat with Rabbi Loren Sykes today.

Cooper tweeted that six men accused of being 'Israeli spies' were dragged through the streets of Gaza City by men on motorcycles after being executed. He also attached a picture of the horrific scenes.

The rabbi tweeted: 'May just stop watching #CNN. Now @andersoncooper almost apologizing for #Hamas dragging a dead "Spy" for #Israel & yelling God is great! Oy.'

To which Cooper fired back: '@Rabbi_Sykes excuse me, but how am I apologizing for Hamas by reporting them dragging a body through the streets? That is deeply offensive.'

Several of the messages have since been deleted.

Cooper spoke today from Gaza for a pre-recorded version of his Thanksgiving chat show Anderson Live.

War of words: Cooper engaged with another critic via his official Twitter account

He talked to Andy Cohen and Kyle Richards who have been standing in while he remains in the Middle East to cover the developing conflict.

When asked about his Twitter trolls, Cooper said: 'You spend hours in the bureau doing live shots and reporting and then there is a lot of down time in between live shots and you're waiting for something to happen. So I spend a lot of time just on Twitter reading people's tweets, responding to people and most of them are really nice.

He added: 'If I tweet something about an outgoing rocket firing towards Israel, they will say that I'm Pro Israeli. If I tweet about a bomb blast here that killed people in Gaza city they will say that I am Pro Hamas, it's a very difficult situation.

'On Twitter it's very easy for people to make ridiculous claims so I've started tweeting back. Last night I was up for many hours so I think I maybe got a little mean.'

He added that he 'kind of felt bad' after his tweet to Mrs Weiss about her enjoyment of a Paula Deen flan recipe.

Cooper has been prolific on Twitter in the midst of the Israeli-Palestinian conflict - even during a close call when a rocket exploded just a few blocks from where he was reporting live.

He was speaking to camera on Sunday night when the huge explosion went off close to where he was standing, causing the veteran journalist to duck for cover.

He was discussing the death toll - which includes ten members of the same family - on the Gaza trip as Israel continues to hit Hamas strongholds.

So far, 110 Palestinians and three Israelis are dead since Operation Pillar of Defence began last Wednesday

it said were the homes of wanted militants.
