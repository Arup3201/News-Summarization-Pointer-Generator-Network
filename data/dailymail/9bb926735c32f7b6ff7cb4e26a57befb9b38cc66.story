Facebook has published its first Transparency Report that reveals the amount of requests made by governments for the personal information of its users

Facebook has published its first Transparency Report that reveals the amount of requests made by governments for the personal information of its users during the first half of this year.

The U.S government topped the list, requesting information on 21,000 users, while India asked for data on 4,144 users in second place, and Britain came in third with 2,337 requests.

However, not all of these requests were granted; Facebook handed over information in only 79 per cent of U.S requests, half of India's requests and 69 per cent of the demands from the UK.

Country    No. requests  Granted

U.S            21,000               79 per cent

India          4,144                 50 per cent

UK             2,337                 69 per cent

Germany   2,068                 37 per cent

France     1,598                  39 per cent

The report shows which countries requested information from Facebook about its users, the number of requests received from each of those countries, the number of users/user accounts specified in those requests and the percentage of these requests in which we were required by law to disclose at least some data.

These figures cover the period ending June 30.

Facebook plans to publish similar reports in the future and Google, Twitter and Microsoft already disclose government requests.

The data requested falls into three categories - subscriber data, traffic data and use data.

Subscriber data, as defined by the Regulation of Investigatory Powers Act (RIPA) 2000, includes all data relating to a subscriber.

'Back in 2000, that would have probably been a landline number, a home address and bank details, but because of the expansion of the internet, that's changed considerably,' explained Nick Pickles, director of privacy watchdog Big Brother Watch.

'With Facebook, this basically applies to everything within the person's user profile. In my opinion, the law needs updating.'

The second category - 'traffic data' - relates to location of a user. Approved authorities can request information from Facebook including where a person was when they posted a message, where they 'checked-in' on a certain day and confirming whether a PC or a mobile phone was used to access the site. This can be helpful when trying to find a missing person, for example.

The third category relates to use. In terms of Facebook, this refers to how you use the site - for example whose wall you post on, who you chat to in the in-built messenger service and who you send private messages to.

The U.S government topped the list, requesting information on 21,000 users, while India asked for data on 4,144 users in second place, and Britain came in third with 2,337 requests. A Facebook world graph of connections between its 500 million user base is pictured

Colin Stretch, Facebook General Counsel said in the report: 'We have stringent processes in place to handle all government data requests.

'We believe this process protects the data of the people who use our service, and requires governments to meet a very high legal bar with each individual request in order to receive any information about any of our users.

'We fight many of these requests, 
pushing back when we find legal deficiencies and narrowing the scope of 
overly broad or vague requests.

'When we are required to comply with a particular request, we frequently share only basic user information, such as name.

The report shows which countries requested information from Facebook about its users, the number of requests received from each of those countries, the number of users/user accounts specified in those requests and the percentage of these requests in which we were required by law to disclose at least some data

'We hope this report will be useful to our users in the ongoing debate about the proper standards for government requests for user information in official investigations.'

The company added that 'the vast majority of these requests relate to criminal cases, such as robberies or kidnappings.

In many of these cases, these government requests seek basic subscriber information, such as name and length of service. Other requests may also seek IP address logs or actual account content.'

Mr Pickles added: 'Given recent debate about both the police’s ability to access data and the scale of surveillance being carried out by intelligence agencies, transparency is the only way to ensure that Parliament can make an informed choice about new legislation and the public can have confidence powers are being used properly.'
