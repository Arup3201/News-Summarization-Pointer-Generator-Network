Defiant: Barrister Camilla Block has refused to co-operate on the two-part ITV drama

The youngest daughter of Lord Lucan has spoken for the first time about her father’s mysterious disappearance and condemned a new TV drama about the case that shocked high society.

Lucan vanished in 1974 after the death of his children’s nanny, Sandra Rivett.

An inquest subsequently found that he murdered her.

But barrister Lady Camilla Bloch said it was important to remember that her father had never stood trial and insisted that evidence against him was ‘circumstantial’. 

The mother of four also revealed she had refused to co-operate with a two-part ITV programme - called Lucan - which will recreate the moment Rivett is bludgeoned to death in the Lucan family home in Belgravia, Central London, on the night of November 7, 1974. 

She said: ‘As a lawyer I hope it’s not old-fashioned to point out that my father never stood trial. It is unfortunate that he is regularly referred to – in almost factual terms – as a murderer.

‘He has never been able to defend himself and the evidence was not conclusive. It was circumstantial.’

On the night in question, Camilla, who was then aged four, was asleep upstairs with her brother George, seven, in the four-storey house in Lower Belgrave Street.

Ms Rivett, 29, was bludgeoned to death in the basement kitchen in what police believed was a case of mistaken identity.

Camilla’s parents had separated the year before and the children were wards of court, with Lord Lucan having lost a bitter custody battle with his wife Veronica.

He had taken to spying on his estranged wife and his children, and lived just 100 yards away in Eaton Row.

Lady Lucan, 75, last night revealed she had also refused to co-operate with the TV production.

She said: ‘I don’t think it is right that a criminal matter should be used for entertainment. The film is based on the most absurd book I have ever read on the Lucan affair so I didn’t think it was sensible to have anything to do with it.’

Skyfall star Rory Kinnear will portray Lucan – aged 39 when he vanished – as a reckless gambler but a devoted father who will stop at nothing to win custody of his children. His estranged wife is played by Catherine McCormack.

Producers say they have gone to great lengths to piece together what they believe are the precise details of the crime.

Viewers will see a desperate Lord Lucan weighing up the pros and cons of murdering his wife before entering her Belgravia home and lying in wait for her in the pitch-black basement kitchen.

Mystery: The family's nanny Sandra Rivett was bludgeoned to death on the evening of November 7, 1974

Lucan removes the light bulb from the room and in the chaos that follows he mistakes Ms Rivett, played by Leanne Best, for his wife and beats her to death with a piece of  lead piping. 

The first episode, which will include a shot of Rivett’s lifeless body,  will end with the shocked peer’s  realisation that he has killed the wrong woman.

Part two of the drama will begin with his subsequent attack on Lady Lucan, which left her with facial injuries. She manages to calm him down before escaping to a nearby pub.

Lady Bloch, an eminent QC, said her thoughts were with the Rivett family and described them as ‘the real victims of this tragedy’. 

She said: ‘It is certainly not a drama I will be watching and it sounds as if it is in extremely poor taste.

‘My concern is for the Rivett family. My heart goes out to her sons and her broader family. 

‘These programmes are very rarely welcomed by my family and certainly are not welcomed by the  Rivetts, for whom this will be very painful indeed.’

Lady Bloch said ITV had contacted her about the project several months ago but had not kept her up to date with its progress.

She said: ‘I was advised in very general terms many months ago that a programme was being planned. 

‘I wasn’t given any insight to the angle which was being pursued. And although I was told I would be kept up to date I haven’t had any further communication from ITV.’

She added: ‘ITV wrote to me to advise that they were making the programme and as I recall they asked whether I’d like to participate. 

‘I responded thanking them for notifying me and I said that I didn’t wish to participate.’

Lucan’s disappearance and the lack of an actual criminal trial means the case has attracted a seemingly endless series of conspiracy theories.

There have been numerous alleged sightings of the peer - from India to South America and Africa - but none of them has ever been substantiated. He was declared legally dead in October 1999.

The car in which in he fled the murder scene was later found in the port of Newhaven, East Sussex, and it is believed he caught a ferry from there to France.

Lady Bloch refused to be drawn on her views on the crime. ‘I don’t have a perspective on it,’ she said. ‘I don’t have any insights that other people don’t have or a case theory.’ 

Lady Lucan last night said she was bored with the constant claims that her husband might still be alive and of the numerous unconfirmed sightings of him.

She is adamant her husband took his own life shortly after the crime and that she had long ago learned to forgive him.

She said: ‘I believe my late husband committed suicide shortly after the murder of Sandra, most probably by bravely throwing himself on to the propellers of a ship in mid-Channel, hoping that his remains would be irrecoverable so that death duties would not be immediately payable as the children’s education had not been secured.

'My husband committed suicide because he was an honourable man.’

She added: ‘Of course, I have learned to forgive him.’

When asked about the British public’s continued obsession with the case, Lady Lucan replied: ‘I didn’t realise people were fascinated with such a dull subject.’

The new drama, written by the Bafta winner Jeff Pope, is based on John Pearson’s 2005 book Gamblers.

The book explores the friendship between members of the notorious Clermont gambling club, which included Lord Lucan, John Aspinall, who will be played in the drama by Christopher Eccleston, Mark Birley and James Goldsmith.

The drama, which will be screened by ITV next month, begins with Pearson carrying out interviews for the book and the episodes are believed to stick very closely to his theories about the crime and Lucan’s subsequent fate.

Producers are keeping precise details of the plot under wraps but it is understood the drama’s action will end in 1975.

Sources have revealed that Lucan’s only son, George Bingham, has met the producers to seek assurances that he will not be portrayed as an adult, and that the show will steer clear of claims that Lucan was reunited with his children on a family holiday to Africa.

A source close to the production said that the film would present Lucan as the killer.

The source said: ‘There are some conspiracy theories out there that say that there was someone else in the house or someone wanted to kill Sandra Rivett but the film won’t make any time for those.

‘The researchers have concluded that it’s doubtful whether Lord Lucan even knew Sandra.’

The programme will claim that Lucan had concocted a ‘very complicated alibi’ but his plans were dashed when Rivett, rather than his wife, entered the room where he was hiding that fateful night.

The sequence of events will show Lucan taking out the lightbulb in the kitchen in the basement of the house and then waiting for his wife to come in.

The peer’s plan goes correctly up until the moment when the wrong person enters the room.

In the dark he fails to recognise Rivett and hits her over her head repeatedly in a brutal attack.

After the murder in the film, Lucan goes upstairs to clean off the length of lead piping and then hears his wife calling. He attacks her but she manages to escape.

The 90-minute episodes will also focus on the  events leading up to the tragedy, including the breakdown of the couple’s marriage and the bitter custody battle  that followed. 

It will also depict the attempt by Lord Lucan to have his wife committed, which failed after she had been examined by psychiatrists and was declared of sound mind – a decision that later helped her to win the custody battle.

The team behind the production have used photographs from the crime scene to help with their  re-creation of the murder. 

A spokeswoman for ITV last night insisted that it had given everyone connected with the case a chance to raise any issues.

The broadcaster had not previously been aware of any concerns and believed the drama would provide new insights into the case. 

The spokeswoman said: ‘ITV has contacted everyone immediately connected with the story  and given them a chance to discuss any concerns.

‘No one connected had declared they were unhappy about us pursuing the drama. This includes the Lucan family and, in particular, the family of Sandra Rivett.

‘The drama seeks to provide a  new insight into the events and, crucially, attempts to answer  the riddle of what became of  Lord Lucan.’
