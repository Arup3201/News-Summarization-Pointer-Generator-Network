Gareth Bale believes Wales’ late comeback victory against Andorra can provide the springboard for Euro 2016 qualification.

In a match that at one stage looked like it might ask questions of Chris Coleman’s job, Bale produced a brace to claim three points.

But despite the ground-out nature of the win against a team ranked 199 in the world, the Real Madrid star thinks Wales will take renewed positivity into matches with other Group B rivals Belgium, Bosnia, Cyprus and Israel.

‘This gives us confidence for what's ahead,’ said Bale. ‘All we could do now was get the three points - no matter how we did it.

‘It's a good start but now the next game is another final and we'll go into it confident we can get another win.’

Bale found the net with a superb header to equalise Ildefons Lima’s penalty, then cracked a free-kick nine minutes from time to seal the win.

‘It was a good team performance,’ Bale added. ‘We knew from the start it was going to be difficult on that pitch.

‘They set up to defend. It wasn't the greatest of starts but we showed true character to keep going and come back like that.’

His free-kick winner actually came at the second attempt after his first was saved by Andorran goalkeeper Ferran Rol. But Slovenian referee Slavko Vincic spotted encroachment from Gabi Riera and ordered a retake.

‘Yes, thank God,’ said Bale. ‘The guy got a yellow card for coming too close and I did better second time around. It's great to get the winning goal for my country.

‘You are thinking the worst but we knew we had enough time to show our ability and the character in the squad.

‘We had massive possession of the ball, they made it difficult in their way, which is what they are going to do to every team.

‘But we showed our class, kept passing the ball as well as we could.’
