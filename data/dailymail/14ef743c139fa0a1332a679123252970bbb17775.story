Locked in an embrace for more than 165 million years, what's thought to be the oldest fossilised evidence of two insects having sex has been discovered in China.

Researchers believe the pair were halfway through mating when they were killed by toxic gases released by a volcanic eruption. They were then blown by the wind into a lake where they were buried, and ultimately protected, for millions of years.

The team from Capital Normal University in China uncovered the intact specimen in the region of Daohugou in Inner Mongolia.

Researchers from China found the preserved specimen under sediment in the Daohugou region of Inner Mongolia. The bugs are still interlocked and both sets of genitals can be clearly seen.

The face-to-face mating ritual of the fossilised insects is similar to that seen in modern-day froghopper insects.

Modern-day
froghoppers traditionally mate belly-to-belly while holding onto a 
twig.

They also mate side-by-side if having sex on a leaf or tree trunk.

The
stomach of the fossilised male is twisted to make inserting his sex 
organ easier, and this is common in modern-day insect species, including the froghoppers.

The insects discovered are members of the Anthoscytina perpetua species.

They were found face-to-face and the male sex organ is seen inserted inside the female.

The holotype male was found on the right, with the allotype female, on the left.

Study co-author Chung Kun Shih said fossils of copulating insects are rare - only 40 have ever been found worldwide - yet this latest discovery predates the oldest known fossil by around 65 million years.

‘We found these two very rare copulating froghoppers which provide a glimpse of interesting insect behaviour and important data to understand their mating position and genitalia orientation during the Middle Jurassic,’ said study author Dong Ren.

‘It is the earliest record of copulating insects to date, and suggests that froghoppers' genital symmetry and mating position have remained static for over 165 million years.’

Because fossil records of mating insects
are so rare, little is known about mating rituals and the anatomical 
position of genitalia especially during the early stages of evolution. This discovery will help expand this knowledge.

The team examined more than 1200 specimens from the locality of Daohugou, China, pictured. The area, and in particular the fossil-rich Daohugou Bed, is said to be part of the Tiaojishan Formation - a rock formation believed to date back to the middle-late Jurassic period

The area, and in particular the fossil-rich Daohugou Bed, is said to be part of the Tiaojishan Formation -  a rock formation in Hebei and Liaoning, China.

The formation is believed to date back to the middle-late Jurassic period.

Ren and Kun Shih’s findings are published in the journal PLOS ONE.
