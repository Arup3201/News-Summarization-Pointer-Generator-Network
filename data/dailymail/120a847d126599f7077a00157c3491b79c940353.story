Michelle Obama put her foot in her mouth again on the campaign trail yesterday, mixing up the personal story of the Democratic senator she was campaigning for, Colorado's Mark Udall, with his Republican opponent in the race, Rep. Cory Gardner. 

'As a fifth generation Coloradan, Mark understands what makes this state special,' Obama told attendees of a Denver rally for Udall.

Gardner's family, not Udall's, has lived in Colorado for five generations. Udall did not move to the Rocky Mountain state until after college. The Democratic lawmaker was born in Arizona. His father Morris represented the state in Congress.

Not again, Michelle! The first lady flubbed the personal story of ANOTHER Democrat on the campaign trail yesterday. Obama claimed at a rally in Denver that Colorado Sen. Mark Udall if a 'fifth generation Coloradoan.' He's not. That's his opponent's tag line

Sorry about that: Obama gives an awkward smile to Udall, left, and Colorado Gov. John Hickenlooper, during a reelection rally for the two incumbent candidates, on the campus of Colorado State University, in Fort Collins. Earlier the day FLOTUS went off script and messed up Udall's bio. She didn't make the same mistake again at her second rally with the two men

Seeking the backing of the White House without having to be seen as an accomplice to the president, Democratic Senate and gubernatorial candidates have latched onto the first lady this election cycle as a top surrogate.

But Mrs. Obama may be doing just as much damage to candidates' campaigns as they fear appearances with her husband would bring about.

At an event for the Democratic nominee to the Senate in Iowa, Bruce Braley, earlier this month FLOTUS claimed the lawmaker was a Marine Corps veteran. He's not. It's his father, Byard Braley, who is the Marine vet.

Obama also called the sitting congressman the wrong name, repeatedly, until an audience member corrected her. 

'Braley, what did I say?' she asked.

'Bailey,' the crowd shouted back at her.

'I'm losin' it. I'm getting old,' she said, laughing the mistake off. 'I've been traveling too much.' 

Indeed, the first lady has been on the road frequently in the weeks leading up to the midterm elections. Today she is in Florida campaigning for Charlie Crist, the former Republican governor who now wants to lead the state on behalf of Democrats.

Yesterday she appeared at not one but two rallies for Udall and and Colorado Gov. John Hickenlooper, who is also up for reelection on Nov. 4. 

On Tuesday she traveled back to Iowa to campaign for Braley a second time. And while the increasingly forgetful first lady did not get his name wrong, the White House mistakenly referred to him as governor of the state in its official transcript of the event.

Hours later the White House acknowledged the blunder and sent out a corrected transcription of the first lady's remarks, but it was too late. Reporters nationwide had already posted stories detailing the Obama administration's latest goof.

President Barack Obama has made his fair share of eyebrow-raising remarks throughout the last month, too.

On two recent occasions Obama has suggested to his supporters that they should judge Democratic candidates claiming to have independent policy agendas on his record instead.

It's my 'policies on the ballot,' he said in an Oct. 2 speech in Illinois at Northwestern University. During a radio interview with Al Sharpton on Monday Obama said incumbent Democrats who are up for reelection 'are all folks who vote with me.'

'They have supported my agenda in Congress,' he asserted.

The White House's sloppy politicking has begun to ruffle feathers among the party's political class. They worry the string of mistakes has taken the focus off of Democratic candidates' accomplishments at a critical point in the election cycle. 

'It doesn’t open up a new line of attack, but it freshens one right as voters are tuning in,' a Democratic strategist, who wished to remain anonymous, told the Los Angeles Times on Thursday.

Another operative, Steve McMahon, a political consultant who has worked on the campaigns of high-profile Democrats like deceased Massachusetts Sen. Ted Kennedy and former Vermont Gov. Howard Dean, said the verbal missteps of White House and the first couple, while embarrassing, are not Democrats' most significant problem right now.

'It is [the president's] approval rating that is actually the real problem here,' McMahon told the LA Times. 

'That other stuff, that just isn’t helpful,' he noted.

The president's favorability rating nationwide hasn't crossed the 50 percent mark in the last year and a half. It's particularly low in a handful of states Democrats need to win in order to keep control of the Senate.
