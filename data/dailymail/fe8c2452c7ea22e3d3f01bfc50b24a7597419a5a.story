Chelsea Manning is seeking a presidential pardon for handing U.S state secrets to the WikiLeaks website because it was done 'out of a love for my country'.

According to documents released today, Manning's lawyer, David Coombs, has sent a Petition for Pardon to President Barack Obama.

The White House said last month that if Manning requested a presidential pardon she would be considered the same as anyone else.

In the petition she wrote that she had started questioning the morality of U.S.
 actions in Iraq and Afghanistan while reading secret military reports.

She said: 'When I chose to disclose classified information, I did so out of a love for my country and sense of duty to others.'

Manning acknowledged she had broken the law, adding, 'I regret if my actions hurt anyone or harmed the United States.'

Manning signed the petition 'Bradley Manning', not Chelsea, as her name has not legally been changed.

Mark Osler, a law professor and 
founder of a commutation clinic at St. Thomas University in Minneapolis,
 gave Manning's petition a 'zero per cent' chance of success.

Osler noted that the President has granted just 39 pardons and one commutation since taking 
office, while he has denied 1,333.

Olser added that it is also very early in Manning's confinement for the White House to seriously consider such a request.

Manning is currently serving a 35-year sentence at Fort Leavenworth, Kansas, for her conviction on July 30 on 20 counts of disclosing information while working as an intelligence analyst in Iraq.

Since being convicted Manning has said she wants to live as a woman and two Army behavioral health specialists diagnosed her with gender dysphoria.

Manning now wants to start hormone replacement therapy inside jail, and though the courts have refused, she is challenging the decision.

In another twist, she is also asking the Army to pay for her treatment under their health insurance scheme.

President Barack Obama has granted relatively few pardons during his time in office

The October 2010 release by Wikileaks of hundreds of thousands of battlefield reports, diplomatic cables and a video of a U.S. helicopter attack that killed civilians, was the largest leak of classified material in U.S. history.

Following the documents' publication Manning was arrested and the Wikileaks site closed down.

Julian Assange, the site's front-man, is still claiming asylum inside the Ecuadorian embassy in London following rape allegations which he claims are bogus charges designed to have him extradited to the U.S.

The Obama administration has cracked 
down on security breaches, charging seven people with leaking to the 
media whereas only three people were prosecuted under all previous 
presidents.

Following his trial, Manning got the longest ever sentence for disclosing U.S. government secrets to others for publication.

At her trial government witnesses testified that some of the leaked information endangered information sources, forced ambassadors to be reassigned, were used as al-Qaida propaganda and even obtained directly by Osama bin Laden.

However, Coombs wrote in a cover letter to Manning's petition that none of Manning's disclosures caused any 'real damage' to the United States and that the documents were not sensitive information meriting protection.

Coombs submitted 11 documents in support of Manning's petition including five documents about Sgt. 1st Class Paul Adkins, one of Manning's former supervisors.

The sergeant testified that he was reprimanded and demoted, apparently for failing to report Manning's troubling behavior - including a photo of the soldier in a blond wig and lipstick - partly because he couldn't risk losing an intelligence analyst.

Also among the documents was a letter from Amnesty International, which said Manning's leaks exposed potential human rights violations.
