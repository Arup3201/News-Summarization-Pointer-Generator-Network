 A human-like ‘skin’ for aircraft - allowing them to detect any damage and ‘feel’ the world around them - is being developed by British experts.

Engineers at BAE Systems’ Advanced Technology Centre are investigating a ‘smart skin’ concept which could be embedded with tens of thousands of micro-sensors.

When applied to an aircraft, it will enable it to sense wind speed, temperature, physical strain and movement, far more accurately than current sensor technology allows.

BAE Systems in Essex has revealed a new technology for aircraft. A human-like 'skin' will detect damage and 'feel' the world around the plane (illustration shown). The smart skin would be embedded with thousands of micro-sensors. These can sense wind speed, temperature and movement accurately

The revolutionary ‘smart skin’ concept will enable aircraft to continually monitor their health, reporting back on potential problems before they become significant.

The US Army has revealed plans to replace tanks with small, 'off road' vehicles covered in smart armour that is more adaptable to modern weaponry.

Military bosses says that current tanks are hindering soldier's ability to get into battle.

The Ground X-Vehicle Technology (GXV-T) programme, dubbed 'X-planes for tanks', is designed to develop a range of new vehicles. 

'GXV-T's goal is not just to improve or replace one particular vehicle - it's about breaking the "more armor" paradigm and revolutionizing protection for all armored fighting vehicles,' said Kevin Massey, DARPA program manager.

'Inspired by how X-plane programs have improved aircraft capabilities over the past 60 years, we plan to pursue groundbreaking fundamental research and development to help make future armored fighting vehicles significantly more mobile, effective, safe and affordable.' 

Engineers say the smart skin system would reduce the need for regular check-ups on the ground and parts could be replaced in a timely manner, increasing the efficiency of aircraft maintenance, the availability of the plane and improving safety.

The tiny sensors or ‘motes’ can be as small as grains of rice and even as small as dust particles at less than 0.002 inches squared (one millimetre squared).

Collectively, the sensors would have their own power source and when paired with the appropriate software, be able to communicate in much the same way that human skin sends signals to the brain.

The sensors are so small that BAE Systems is exploring the possibility of retrofitting them to existing aircraft and even spraying them on like paint.

Leading the research and development is Senior Research Scientist Lydia Hyde whose ‘eureka’ moment came when she was doing her washing and observed that her tumble dryer uses a sensor to prevent it from overheating.

She said: 'Observing how a simple sensor can be used to stop a domestic appliance overheating, got me thinking about how this could be applied to my work and how we could replace bulky, expensive sensors with cheap, miniature, multi-functional ones.

'This in turn led to the idea that aircraft, or indeed cars and ships, could be covered by thousands of these motes creating a "smart skin" that can sense the world around them and monitor their condition by detecting stress, heat or damage.

'The idea is to make platforms "feel" using a skin of sensors in the same way humans or animals do.

'By combining the outputs of thousands of sensors with big data analysis, the technology has the potential to be a game-changer for the UK industry.

'In the future we could see more robust defence platforms that are capable of more complex missions whilst reducing the need for routine maintenance checks.

'There are also wider civilian applications for the concept which we are exploring.'

The research is part of a range of new systems being investigated by BAE Systems under a major programme exploring next-generation technology for air platforms.
