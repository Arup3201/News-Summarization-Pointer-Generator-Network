From the very first smile to a first tooth, baby steps and heading off to school, it's common for parents to capture the precious moments of their children growing up.

But Suman Bansal from Gillingham, Kent, has been photographed every single day of her life since she was born on May 16 1996, totalling an astonishing 6,575 pictures.

The student, who turns 18 tomorrow, is used to smiling for photographs taken by her father Munish, who has documented his daughter's life from the very beginning. And now every single image has been pieced together to make a giant portrait of the teenager in time for her 18th birthday.

Munish started by taking pictures of his wife Rita's ultrasound images when she was pregnant in January 1996.

The 41-year-old accountant has since captured daughter Suman growing from baby to toddler to schoolgirl to college student.

Munish explains: 'I decided to do this when Rita was pregnant.

'I just wanted to make a memory to see how they changed day to day, because if you see a child on a month to month basis you can see a big change and I wanted to see that change.'

The proud 
father would mostly take the pictures in the morning before school, but 
sometimes in the afternoon when they got back home.

'Initially it was a hard challenge, but it has become like a routine. Naturally, it is a big commitment,' he says.

There have only been a couple of heart-stopping moments when Munish thought a day was passing without a picture.

He had also been documenting his son Jay's life, although the youngster opted out of the project at aged fifteen.

Munish explains: 'There were couple of occasions I can remember it almost didn't happen. Once my wife thought I had taken the photos and while I was at work they went to stay at their aunt's home for a night. I had to go to her house to take the photos, but luckily they don't live far.

'There was another occasion when I nearly missed them, because I was busy with my work and the children went to sleep, but it suddenly clicked: I had to wake up the children.'

Suman says: 'Being photographed every day just feels like any normal day as I have grown up with it my whole life.

'At times it can become irritating as I don't always feel my best especially when I am running late. I do not have a favourite picture because all are special. I cannot compare.'

Suman is currently completing her A-levels, but hopes to go to university in September and aims to be a children's nurse.

She says: 'I would like to train and study to be a paediatric nurse, but keep photography as hobby.

'I am probably not going to continue the photographs when I leave home; I am very likely to forget a day.'

Munish also believes the project will come to a natural finish. He says: 'I will continue for next few months, Suman wants to continue, but once she has gone to university, it might be difficult for her, but let's see.'
