An elderly man tried to carry out a suicide bombing on a bus in eastern China because he was upset with the driver.

Wang Shichao, 77, threw a grenade at the driver of a bus in Wucheng, Zhejiang, because he kept stopping a few yards beyond his stop.

Fortunately, Mr Wang used an antique stick grenade which failed to detonate properly, local media reported.

Attack: Wang Shichao became furious when the bus driver stopped a few meters away from his bus stop and used an antique hand grenade to get revenge

CCTV footage showed Mr Wang approaching the drivers seat and throwing the grenade, which due to its old age only caused a small explosion and puffs of white smoke.

Mr Wang had kept the antique grenade in his basement for years and it fell apart when thrown on the floor of the bus, South China Morning Post reported.

The grenade failed to cause any damage or injuries and the elderly would-be suicide bomber was quickly subdued by his fellow passengers. 

During his trial, Mr Wang said he was 'angry with the driver because he had not stopped precisely at the bus stop on a previous occasion'.

Mr Wang said he attempted the suicide bombing because he was angry with the driver who kept driving past the bus stop, and pulling over a few yards down the road

Mr Wang said he had gone home and located the grenade in his basement before carrying it onto the bus last October. 

He told the court he had wanted to die along with the bus driver and plead guilty.

Mr Wang's legal representative asked the court for leniency due to his age and poor health.

The sentence will be delivered at the Wucheng District People’s Court at a later date.
