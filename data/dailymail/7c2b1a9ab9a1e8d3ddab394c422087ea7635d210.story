When he volunteered as judge at a charity dog show he probably didn't count on the contestants taking his comments personally.

But animal loving former MP Lembit Opik found himself needing medical attention after an irate sausage dog launched itself at him and bit his privates.

Good humoured Mr Opik, who was once engaged to Cheeky Girl Gabriella Irimia laughed off the encounter but friends claim it left him in pain and struggling to walk.

Mr Opik, 48, told the Mirror: 'Nothing had prepared me for one frisky four-legged 'friend' which insisted on taking a bad-tempered munch on my meat and two veg.

'I haven't felt so violated since being passed up for a peerage by Nick Clegg.'

The incident happened as Mr Opik was judging a charity dog show in aid of Guide Dogs last week in Lambeth, London.

But one friend said the attack was more serious than the one time comedian let on.

He said: 'He may see the funny side now but it was really painful and he had difficulty walking.

'He hopes it hasn't done any permanent damage.

'But it won't stop him judging dog shoes as he's a real animal lover and accepts that it was just a one-off.'

It's the second time an animal has taken exception to the star - he was bitten by a snake while filming the reality TV show in the Australian jungle in November 2010.

Fortunately on that occasion a less sensitive body part was the target and after some antiseptic cream his fanged finger was on the mend.

Since quitting Westminster the former Lib Dem spokesman on Wales and Northern Ireland has tried a number of different jobs including stand-up comedian and even wrestling.

He currently works as a music manager and is responsible for the band The Wholls and singer song-writer Nikki Murray.

Mr Opik split with Gabriela in 2008 two years after they met when she and her sister Monica shot to fame with their hit single The Cheeky Song (Touch My Bum.)

The ex-MP for Montgomery was previously engaged to weathergirl Sian Lloyd.

Speaking recently about his now strained relationship with his former leader Nick Clegg he said: 'There was one moment at the spring conference when I was going down the stairs and Nick was coming.

'He chose to stare straight through me. Now I know what it is like to be the invisible man.'
