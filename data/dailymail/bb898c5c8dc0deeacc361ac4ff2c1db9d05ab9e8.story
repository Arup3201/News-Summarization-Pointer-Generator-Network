Her body is so perfectly  preserved that it is hard to believe this girl died more than 500 years ago.

But what is even more remarkable is that scientists today have been able to learn the secrets of her death – by analysing her hair.

The 13-year-old Incan girl was heavily dosed with alcohol and  coca leaves, which form the basis of cocaine, before being left to die of exposure high in the Andes as a sacrifice.

The children included a 13-year-old known as the 'Llullaillaco Maiden' whose remains were struck by lightning and charred. She was well fed and chosen for her beauty and possibly nobility

Capacocha was a ritual that took place upon the death of an Inca king.

The local lords were required to select unblemished children representing the ideal of human perfection.

Children were married and presented with sets of miniature human and llama figurines in gold, silver, copper and shell.

The male figures have elongated earlobes and a braided headband and the female figurines wore their hair in plaited.

The children were then returned to their original communities, where they were honoured before being sacrificed to the mountain gods on the Llullaillaco Volcano (pictured).

Known as the Ice Maiden, she is one of three children found in stone tombs on a mountain in Argentina.

The girl, the eldest of the three, was found cross-legged, with her head slumped forward and her hands resting in her lap. 

She wore a feather headdress over her tightly braided hair and there 
were coca leaves between her teeth and balled up behind her cheek.

The children were discovered in 1999.

They are believed to have been 
sacrificed in a ceremony called capacocha, a ritual thought to have been
used to instil fear and help control members of the rapidly expanding 
Inca empire.

Analysis  of the children’s hair, which still contains a 
chemical fingerprint of their diet, shows that all three were plied with
drugs and alcohol to subdue them in the months before they died.

Amounts were particularly high in the 13-year-old girl, perhaps because 
she showed more resistance.

The chemical analysis was carried out by 
researchers at the University of Bradford, and published in the journal 
Proceedings of the National Academy of Sciences.

The researchers said the coca leaves, which release a mild stimulant 
when chewed and sucked, would have helped her cope with the demands of 
altitude.

The three Children of Llullaillaco, who were deep frozen rather than embalmed, were also found with an extraordinary collection of elaborate gold, silver and shell statues, textiles and pots containing food

The trio - whose selection was a great honour - were brought to the summit of Mount Llullaillco in the Andes which lies near the Chilean border where they were put to death in a ritual called capacocha

The chicha, an alcoholic drink made from fermented maize, would have 
helped her deal with the cold.

But it could also have hastened her 
death by stopping her from shivering.

There is no evidence that the girl, known as the Llullaillaco Maiden  
after the mountain in northwest Argentina, was brutally killed.

Instead, it is thought she died of exposure. Priests would have waited 
for her to fall unconscious before placing her in a burial chamber.

Dr Andrew Wilson, from the University of Bradford, said: ‘We think it 
likely that the Maiden was selected for sacrifice 12 months before her 
death, after which her treatment changed, corresponding to the sharp 
rise in coca consumption.

‘She was then probably involved in a series of rituals, involving 
consumption of coca and alcohol in the build up to her sacrifice.

‘Both substances were controlled, were considered elite products.

‘The fact that in her final weeks the maiden shows consistently higher 
levels of coca and alcohol use compared to the younger children suggests
there was a greater need to sedate her in the final weeks of life.’
