Stuart Broad sank to his knees at the end of five hard days of Test cricket, barely able to believe that he could not penetrate the defences of Nuwan Pradeep and take England to what would have been an extraordinary Lord’s victory.

Sri Lanka’s last man, who had comically fallen on to his own wicket in the first innings, had somehow kept out the last five balls of the match to keep Broad and England at bay and earn his side the most hard fought and dramatic of draws.

Pradeep, with a Test average of five, had been given out when the penultimate ball thudded into his pads to cue wild English celebrations but Paul Reiffel’s decision was overturned when the review made it painfully clear that ball had struck bat before pad.

England’s ecstasy soon turned to agony at 6.45pm on the final day but when the dust settles on this first Investec Test they will surely acknowledge that Sri Lanka deserved to hang on after playing a full part in what became a wonderful advertisement for the ultimate form of the game.

A Test that long seemed destined to be
 drawn on a low, slow batting paradise of a pitch exploded into life one
 last time when England came within a hair’s breadth of taking the seven
 wickets they needed in the final session.

That
 they took six of them and were only denied the seventh by the correct 
intervention of technology was a monumental effort and one that should 
provide further encouragement in their attempts to recover from their 
Ashes disaster.

England 
will look back and wonder what might have been had they declared on the 
fourth evening or, more pertinently, if both sides had not been guilty 
of tardy over-rates which meant 17 overs were shamefully lost over the 
first four days.

Yet it 
would be churlish to blame Alastair Cook for a near miss that owed 
everything to a magnificent effort from England’s four-man pace attack 
who gave their all in conditions that were more akin to Colombo than St 
John’s Wood.

How England 
would have loved to have had Graeme Swann in their ranks after giving 
themselves all day to bowl out Sri Lanka knowing the visitors would have
 to make history if they were to reach their unlikely victory target of 
390.

Life after one of their
 greatest spinners was never going to be easy and England will have to 
rely on pace while Moeen Ali develops as a replacement or Monty Panesar 
gets his head together in time to face India next month.

At
 least, in Jimmy Anderson and Broad, England have two world-class fast 
bowlers who took seven of the nine wickets to fall on Monday, Anderson 
returning to his very best in claiming three wickets for one run either 
side of tea.

And with 
debutant Chris Jordan taking the other two, including what seemed the 
key victim in Prasanna Jayawardene just ahead of the new ball, it looked
 as though England would get away with their lack of a spin specialist.

Breakthrough: Stuart Broad claimed the first wicket on day five with a short ball claiming Dimuth Karunaratne

Safe hands: Sam Robson (left) took the catch at short leg as opening bowler Broad got the ball rolling

Not messing about: Karunaratne walks off after scoring 16 in 24 balls, including three boundaries

England 575-9 dec (Root 200 no, Prior 86, Bell 56, Pradeep 4-123) & 267-8 dec (Ballance 104 no, Herath 4-95)

Sri Lanka 453 (Sangakkara 147, Mathews 102, Silva 63, Jayawardene 55) & 201-9 (Sangakkara 61, Silva 57, Anderson 4-25)

England drew with Sri Lanka

Certainly
 when Rangana Herath gloved Broad to Matt Prior at the start of the last
 over and did not hang around for Reiffel’s decision even though replays
 suggested his hand was off his bat handle at the moment the ball 
touched his glove, England felt the Test and a 1-0 lead with one to play
 in Leeds was theirs. It was not to be.

The
 final day had appeared an exercise in frustration as Kaushal Silva and 
Kumar Sangakkara initially repelled everything England could throw at 
them but Anderson (right) summoned up the spirit of Trent Bridge last 
season to provide one last twist to a fluctuating tale.

The
 leader of England’s attack - now 33 behind Sir Ian Botham’s all-time 
Test wicket-taking record of 383 - took out the big two in Sangakkara 
and Mahela Jaywardene plus the man he has now dismissed 10 times in Test
 cricket in Lahiru Thirimanne.

Hot streak: Anderson celebrates the wicket of Lahiru Thirimanne, his first of two in a single over

On the charge: Thirimanne edges the delivery of a rampant Anderson and Chris Jordan takes the catch

Getting settled: England couldn't remove first innings centurion Sangakarra in the first session

Personal milestone: Sangakkara acknowledges the crowd as he reaches his 50

Suddenly, out of nowhere, England were in
 sight of victory. Yet such was Sri Lanka’s defiance through Prasanna 
Jaywardene, who batted with a broken finger, and captain Angelo Mathews 
that two wickets were still needed from that last over, Cook going back 
from the wicketless Liam Plunkett to his big gun in Broad.

It
 was Broad who almost  completed a thrilling win, Pradeep taking 
advantage of his reprieve by edging the final delivery just in front of 
Jordan at second slip. Both he and Sri Lanka survived in tact ahead of 
Friday’s second Test.

It 
would be simplistic to say England would have won had they declared on 
Sunday because, with their own wickets falling regularly on the fourth 
day, they were never really in a position to do so.

Another start: Sri Lanka's Kaushal Silva (right) passed the half century mark for the second time this match

Going up: Gary Ballance, Jordan,Cook and Ian Bell appeal for the wicket of Karunaratne

Scratchy: Despite some shaky moments, Silva backed up his first innings 63 with 57 in his second dig

Gone: Chris Jordan claims the wicket of Silva with Prior claiming his first catch of the day after it was reviewed

Only
 when Gary Ballance had averted the possibility of an  England defeat 
and launched a counter-attack which saw 59 runs come off the last seven 
overs of the fourth day could Cook be  satisfied that he had enough runs
 to guarantee against defeat.

Both
 the timing of his declaration and his tactics on the final day, which 
saw attacking and unusual field placings, could not be faulted.

In
 the end it was Mick Hunt’s pitch that just about had the final say and 
both teams will be satisfied with their efforts as they head to 
Headingley to do it all again in three days time. The game was drawn and
 the England captain should not be hung and quartered by his critics 
because of that.
