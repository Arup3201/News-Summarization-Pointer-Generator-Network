Theo Walcott has expressed his delight at coming through his first full training session in nine months as the Arsenal forward edges closer to full fitness after his knee injury lay-off.

The England star looked sharp as he and his Arsenal team-mates were put through their paces at London Colney.

And the speedster is expected to be fit enough to be on the substitutes bench for Arsenal against Hull on Saturday - a welcome boost to manager Arsene Wenger who is already without the likes of Mesut Ozil, Aaron Ramsey and Olivier Giroud.

It will come as a relief for Wenger and the club's supporters to see Walcott striking free-kicks, connecting with volleys and running at pace during Monday's training session, and the Gunners boss hinted that a return for the winger could be imminent.

'Theo is not too far away now,' Wenger said last week. 'Serge has been out for a long, long time and Theo has also been out for nine months, so it's good to see them back. 

'They've worked very hard and they're very dedicated. They are back in the group on a daily basis and that's very good news.'

Arsenal boss Wenger has praised the attitude of both Walcott and Gnabry as they have battled their way back from serious knee injuries

Gunners goalkeeper Wojciech Szczesny, meanwhile, has praised young defender Calum Chambers for his attitude and humility since joining the club in July.

'It is a strange one because I would imagine that to be very successful at 19 you need to be massively confident, maybe overconfident at times,' the goalkeeper told the club's official website.

'But Calum isn't - he's very humble, very quiet and he shows his confidence on the pitch. It is a massive quality because he looks very comfortable, whether you play him at right back or centre back.

'He is comfortable on the ball, he is comfortable defending and he is very strong as well. He has been a massive signing.

'The pressure was on him as well because he was 19, he came to a big club and he went straight into the starting XI but he has been coping very well.'
