Hunk on the hunt: Eli Roth has launched a search for the most terrifying Vine, a six-second video posted on social media, which set to be judged by Quentin Tarantino

After the global success of his gore galore flicks Hostel I and II, Roth is now turning his attention to finding the new generation of horror film directors alongside Tarantino.

This is not the first time the two have teamed up on a film project, and to the mainstream audience, Roth is probably best known for his unforgettable job as Donny ‘The Bear Jew’ Donowitz in Tarantino's Inglourious Basterds from 2009.

‘Tarantino doesn't even own a cell phone, so for him to see these videos is pretty amazing,’ the 42-year-old told MailOnline.

‘He just wants to encourage and support budding filmmakers.’
