Houston, Texas has topped the list of dog attacks against postal workers, with 63 mailmen being bitten on their rounds in the city in the past year.

After 5,581 of its employees were attacked in the past year, the postal service has started pleading with customers to take more responsibility for their pets.

Overall, Texas had five cities in the top 30 list of highest recorded attacks, including two in the top 10.

For Dallas, a steep rise in attacks moved the city up from ninth place on the list last year with 27 attacks, to the number one worst city this year.

'Houston has typically been in the top 10 for as long as we have been keeping track of dog attacks,' Dionne Montague, a USPS spokesperson based in the city, said.

'It's all dogs, since all dogs can bite. It's not one particular breed,' she added.

Being bitten while at work has a negative impact on postal workers, who in some cases start to become nervous about doing their rounds.

'You have the physical injuries and mental injuries to deal with, because emotionally you are now scared almost to do your job,' Montague told the Houston Chronicle, adding that the majority of attacks on staff were from pets.

In one case, a woman postal worker who was attacked by a pit bull last month is still recovering from her injuries. 

Houston Humane Society spokeswoman Monica Schmidt said part of the problem was because of stray dogs in the city.

'Some
 irresponsible pet owners are letting their dogs roam freely, and there 
are also unaltered pets that typically have a higher prey drive,' she 
said.

'Houston’s 
ever-growing stray dog situation is also one of the most prominent 
components that have Houston leading the nation in dog attacks on postal
 workers.'

With the safety of their workers a priority, the postal service has the right to demand that dog owners collect their mail from the post office if their dog is considered dangerous.

The problem of dangerous dogs taking a swipe at the mailman is widespread, with 62 cities across the U.S. making it to the top 30.

The high number is because several cities tied on the same number of attacks.

After Houston, the cities with the highest recorded number of dog bites were Los Angeles, Cleveland, San Diego and Chicago, with 61, 58, 53, and 47 attacks respectively.

To protect their staff, and to ensure customers still get their mail delivered, the USPS has created a set of guidelines for dog owners, to encourage them to be responsible.

'There’s a myth we often hear at the postal service: "Don't worry, my dog won't bite,' Linda DeCarlo, Manager of Safety at USPS, said.

Owners are advised to keep their pet in a separate room while opening the door and to be careful about letting children take mail from the post worker when a dog is present, in case the family pet sees it as a threat.

Postal workers weren't the only ones to be attacked last year. About 4.5 million Americans were bitten by dogs in the U.S., including more than 2 million children, according to figures released as part of National Dog Bite Prevention Week.

The high number of bites also led to $483 million in insurance payouts.
