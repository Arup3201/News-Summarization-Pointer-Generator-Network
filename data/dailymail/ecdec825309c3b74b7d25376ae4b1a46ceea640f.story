America's largest producer of Thanksgiving turkeys has announced a shortage of fresh birds, just as millions of families begin clearing space in their fridge for the holidays.

Butterball said Friday that it had fewer than usual fresh large turkeys because its poultry has had trouble gaining weight on some of the company's farms.

While there are ample supplies of its frozen large varieties, Butterball told retailers, including East Coast grocery chain Big Y Foods Inc, their orders for fresh turkeys 16 pounds and bigger have been cut by 50 per cent.

'We experienced a decline in weight gains on some of our farms causing a limited availability of large, fresh turkeys,' Stephanie Llorente, a spokeswoman for Butterball, said in a written statement.

She added that they didn't know why their birds were more svelte than normal this year.

'While we are continuing to evaluate all potential causes, we are working to remedy the issue.

'We sincerely regret the inconvenience that some of our customers have experienced as a result of this issue.'

The shortage is a major concern as the company, headquartered in Garner, North Carolina, produces around 20 per cent of the country's turkeys - or more than one billion pounds a year - and 16 pounds is the average weight of birds served up on the Thanksgiving dinner table.

A bird that size would feed a dinner party of six adults and six children, Butterball's handy turk-ulater states.

The popular brand, known for its blue, gold and yellow label, is a mainstay in American kitchens every Thanksgiving.

However, there are a number of other brands that should be delighted to fill the gap.

Big Y said it immediately sourced additional turkeys from other suppliers in order to have ample supply for its customers, adding 'All of us at Big Y will do our best to ensure that our customers have a wonderful turkey for their Thanksgiving meal.'
