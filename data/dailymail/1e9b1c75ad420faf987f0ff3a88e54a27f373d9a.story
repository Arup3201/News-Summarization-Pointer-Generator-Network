Holidaymakers who are planning a Spanish getaway this autumn or winter may want to skip bustling Barcelona and head to less travelled cities if they’re working on a shoestring budget.

The Catalan capital is the most expensive Spanish city for travellers, according to a TripAdvisor study that compared the cost of an average overnight stay for two people in 52 locations across the country.

With an average one-night bill of £182.70, Barcelona is nearly double the cost of Lugo, the most affordable destination in Spain.

The study compared the cost of a one-night stay in a four-star hotel plus cocktails, a two-course dinner with a bottle of wine and transportation in a taxi.

At the top of the chart, Barcelona was followed by Ibiza (£176.57), Palma de Mallorca (£173.83), San Sebastian (£168.81) and the capital Madrid (£146.26). 

Lugo – the only city in the world to be surrounded by intact Roman walls – is the biggest bargain break with an average cost of £92.28 per night.

It was followed by Murcia (£92.91), Ourense (£92.93), Badajoz (£95.43) and Castellon (£99.08).

When it comes to the price of a hotel room, Barcelona was the most expensive city with a night in a four-star hotel costing an average of £115.63.

For the price of one night in Barcelona, two people could have dinner with wine plus cocktails, cab fare, and a night in a four-star hotel in Tarragona and still have money left over, TripAdvisor says.

The cheapest four-star hotel rooms are found in Castellon with an average cost of £41.51 – three times less than pricey Barcelona.

As for dinner, Huesca is the cheapest Spanish city for a two-course meal and a bottle of house wine (£28.09), while Ibiza is the most expensive with an average price of £47.55.

Madrid is the most expensive city for cocktails, averaging £20.81 for two people.
