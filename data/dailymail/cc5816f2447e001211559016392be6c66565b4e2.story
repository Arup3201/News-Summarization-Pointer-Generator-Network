Geoffrey Edelsten has denied rumours he is bankrupt after it was revealed the controversial businessman is being chased for millions of dollars by the Australian Tax department.

During an awkward interview with A Current Affair, the 71-year-old avoided directly answering the question, 'are you bankrupt,' giving a vague undecipherable answer instead.

'Under chapter seven … by asking that question … a show in Australia, people conjure up what it means in Australia... it's totally different,' Mr Edelsten Channel Nine, before adding, 'everything is under control.'

'I am solvent and in the petitions we will produce to the courts I think it showed assets of $38 million and liabilities of $28 million of which $10 million are disputed.

'So there's probably about $18 million, so it's comfortable.'

The Australian Taxation Office (ATO) is currently pursuing the former doctor for $14,130,000 in taxes and penalties after $30 million was mysteriously removed from his private trust account's financial records.

It plans to reverse a settlement Mr Edelsten made with the Mawardi family – his former business partners in Florida - through the US Bankruptcy Court, arguing that his trustees could have been unaware of the undisclosed $30 million, News Limited reports.

Despite the Australian Federal court restricting his assets last month and the millions of dollars that Mr Edelsten owes the National Australia bank, he remains positive that his debts will not reach above $12 million.

'If I am successful with the case against Mawardi, it's going to be around about 12 million,' he told A Current Affair, adding that if he was not successful, his debts would be around $20 million. 

'But I will be successful because justice will be on my side,' Mr Edelsten said.

Mr Edelsten, who earlier this year declared bankruptcy in the US, owes money to over 30 international creditors, according to the ABC.

Daily Mail Australian contacted the ATO and a media spokesperson said they were unable to hand out information on individual clients.
