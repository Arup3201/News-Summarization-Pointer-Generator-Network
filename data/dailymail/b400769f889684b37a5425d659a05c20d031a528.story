Juan Cuadrado had come to symbolise a young man with ambition and desire to succeed against the odds long before his £27million transfer to Chelsea.

Cuadrado was born in 1988, days before Chelsea were relegated from the top flight, and raised in the port city of Tumaco, in Colombia's south west, which became one of the most dangerous and violent regions of the country as the drug wars forced the coca growers out of more traditional areas.

His father Guillermo, who drove a fuel tanker, was shot dead by guerrillas when Juan was five-years-old. In interviews, he said he remembered little about the incident and hid under the bed.

He was raised by his mother Marcela and they remain inseparable. She has promised to stay with him until he has a family of his own. Marcela and Juan's half-sister Maria Angel moved to Italy when he left Independiente Medellin in 2009 for Udinese, and will follow him to London, along with his girlfriend Melissa Botero.

Cuadrado admits he still likes his mother's lentil and chickpea stews and she sometimes braids his hair, which can take hours. They have starred together in a tomato sauce advert in Colombia. Marcela said: 'Seeing his dreams come true has made me the happiest mum in the world.'

As a football-mad boy in South America, he idolised Brazilian striker Ronaldo and started out as a striker but had reverted to right-back by the time he had broken into the Medellin team as a teenager.

Having failed to make an impression on trial with a second tier team in Argentina, he got his break with a move to Udinese and it was during a season on loan at Lecce where he was able to refine his game and was converted into a wide midfielder or wing-back.

He became a key man in the Colombia team and was signed by Fiorentina, where striker Luca Toni dubbed him 'Vespa', because of his knack of zipping through the traffic on the pitch.

Fiorentina paid £4.5m for half of Cuadrado's rights, buying the other half during last year's World Cup, where he helped Colombia to the last eight. His transfer to Chelsea was completed on Monday. He has signed a four-and-a-half year deal at Stamford Bridge and will wear the No 23.
