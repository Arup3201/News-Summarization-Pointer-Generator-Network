Britain's flooding nightmare is set to continue this week, as renewed rainfall swells rivers and inundates areas which have been underwater for weeks.

Many regions have suffered on and off from flooding since before Christmas, with rivers at dangerous levels and vast areas of land saturated with floodwater.

After a mild weekend many areas appeared tranquil today - but with more rain set to fall across the South of England, householders will feel yet more pain over the next few days.

Eight people have died and more than 1,700 homes and businesses have been flooded in England since the beginning of the Christmas period.

The Environment Agency today warned that Dorset, South Wiltshire, Somerset and the Thames Valley would face continued flooding, with heavy rain forecast for Wednesday.

In addition, rivers are at worryingly high levels in Hampshire, West Berkshire, Surrey, West Sussex, Wiltshire and along the River Severn.

The agency added that Wednesday's predicted rain would fall on 'already saturated ground', increasing the flood risk and prolonging the time it will take for affected areas to recover.

There are more than 150 flood warnings and alerts currently in place, with much of South-East England and the West Country warned to stay vigilant.

Be prepared: More than 150 flood warnings and alerts were today in place across the South of England

'There is a continued risk of flooding in southern England, especially Dorset, South Wiltshire, Somerset and the Thames Valley, and we urge people to remain vigilant and prepared to take action,' a spokesman for the Environment Agency said today.

'Environment Agency teams are out on the ground, maintaining flood defences, clearing watercourses and deploying pumps and temporary defences to protect communities at risk.'

A pest control company has predicted that the widespread flooding will encourage an 'influx of rats' by forcing the rodents to seek shelter on high ground away from rivers.

Chris Davis of Cleankill Environmental Services said: â€˜The rats are simply trying to find dry places to live.

'Rats like water and are good swimmers but they canâ€™t tolerate being submerged for long periods and can drown.'

Householders are advised not to tackle the rats themselves as they can become aggressive if they are cornered and there is a risk of being bitten.

However, it's not all bad news about the weather - in a public garden in Dorset, one plucky daffodil defied the turbulent weather and flowered three months ahead of schedule.

The flower emerged from the ground at Abbotsbury Sub-Tropical Gardens near Weymouth in Dorset last week.

Despite the storms, temperatures have been relatively mild for January, with the thermometer rising as high as 10C.

'It is quite unusual to see these daffodils flowering so early,' said curator Stephen Griffith.

'We thought the cold December might push it back a bit, but we have had mild temperatures this January that seem to be the reason it is in full bloom so early.'
