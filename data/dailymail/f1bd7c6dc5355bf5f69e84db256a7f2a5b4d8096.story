A contingent of National Guard troops was dispatched to a Hawaii town on Thursday to provide security to the Big Island community threatened by a river of molten lava that is slowly creeping toward the town's main road, an emergency official said.

The lava flow from the Kilauea volcano has been slithering toward the village of Pahoa for weeks and at last watch was advancing at less than five miles an hour, said Darryl Oliveira, director of Hawaii County Civil Defense.

On Thursday morning, a contingent of 83 National Guard troops was traveling in a road convoy and expected to arrive later in the day in the community, where some residents have expressed concern about potential looters targeting evacuated homes.

"These are local troops, people from the community. They'll be here working to take care of their family and friends," Oliveira told a news conference.

The lava threatens to destroy homes and cut off a road and a highway through Pahoa, but officials have not offered any predictions on when exactly it could bisect the town of about 800 residents at the site of an old sugar plantation.

No homes have been destroyed so far, and a finger of lava that threatens one house on the edge of town has not advanced closer to the evacuated structure since Wednesday night, Oliveira said. The lava remained about 100 feet from the home, he said.

Meanwhile, the glowing leading edge of the lava flow is now about 160 yards from Pahoa Village Road, the main street through the town of almost 1,000, officials said in a statement.

Residents of about 50 dwellings in what civil defense officials called a "corridor of risk" have been asked to be ready to leave, and many have been slowly emptying their homes of furniture and treasured possessions.

Lava from a vent at Kilauea volcano, one of the earth's most active, has been sliding northeast toward the ocean since an eruption on June 27. 

Locals say the molten rock is being spread by Pele, the Hawaiian volcano goddess.

'She is so gentle, but so unrelenting. She is just slow and steady,' said Jamila Dandini, a retiree who stopped at a coffee shop down the road from where scientists have forecast the lava will likely cross.

Last month, scientists said it was two weeks away from hitting the main road in Pahoa. The lava slowed but has largely remained on course.

Hawaii County civil defense officials said it was about 225 yards away from Pahoa Village Road yesterday evening, traveling about five to 10 yards an hour.

The slow pace has given residents time to pack their valuables and get out of the way. 

 But it has been agonizing for those wondering whether the lava might change directions and head for them - and stressful for those trying to figure out how they will cope once the lava blocks the only roads in and out of town.

Once the lava crosses the road and the bypass road, effectively slicing Pahoa in half, most residents won't be able to get to the area's only supermarket even though it's only a mile from the town center.

The rural, mostly agricultural community of Puna, for which Pahoa is its commercial center, will be cut off even more if the lava makes it all the way to the ocean, some six miles away.

Some businesses are closing or moving. Some are vowing to stay.

Ms Dandini likened the impending isolation to being on 'an island on an island.'

She predicted it would be an opportunity for people to work together to solve their problems. 

Construction crews prepare Pahoa Village Road as lava flow from Mt Kilauea approaches. 'It's like slow torture,' said Paul Utes, who owns a cafe in the town

The lava has been moving at varying speeds for four months. Observations determined it was 510 meters from Pahoa Village Road

Paul Utes, who owns the Black Rock Cafe, said: 'It's like slow torture. It speeds up, it slows down. It speeds up, it slows down.

'It's not like any other event where it comes and goes and it gets over with and you can move on.'

Mr Utes' restaurant is not in the predicted path even though it's just a few hundred yards south from where the lava will likely cross the main road.

But he worries this could change. Even if the cafe is spared, he doesn't know how traffic will be diverted once lava crosses the road, how his vendors will supply his restaurant and what the public — his customers — will do.

The lava has already had a huge effect and once it seeps into town, most residents won't be able to reach the area's only supermarket

For the time being, business is up because more people from around the island and tourists from outside Hawaii have been streaming into town hoping to get a glimpse of the molten rock.

'The anxiety building up is kind of hard to deal with,' he said.

Some changes brought by lava are already starting to have an effect.

The county bus no longer passes through the main street lined with wood buildings dating to the town's heyday as a lumber and sugar-plantation town. 

So Ms Dandini has to walk into town from where the bus drops her off on the outskirts.

Some people, she said, have been discussing pooling their resources for supply runs to Hilo, the nearest city, because it could take hours to get there on alternate routes once Pahoa's main roads are cut off.

So far, lava has burned a garden shed, tires and some metal materials.

Dozens of homes, business and other structures are in the area of the lava flow. That number could increase as the flow front widens.

Erbin Gamurot, 48, a handyman, said Pele just wants to visit her sister, Namakaokahai, the sea goddess.

'She's doing what she gotta do. That's her way, that's her nature. Who can stop her?' he asked.
