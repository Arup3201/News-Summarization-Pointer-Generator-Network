The French vote themselves both the most arrogant and the least arrogant European country

Britain and France have finally found something they agree on – that the French are the most arrogant people in Europe.

That’s the verdict of a sweeping new US survey about the attitudes of European countries towards each other.

Not surprisingly, many national stereotypes are reinforced in the poll.

Britons not only find their neighbours across the channel the most arrogant, they also believe them to be the least trustworthy.

In true contradictory fashion, the French vote themselves both the most arrogant and the least arrogant country in Europe.

The Germans are almost universally judged the most trustworthy, although eyebrows may be raised at the only dissenter, Greece, which saves that accolade for itself despite its financial meltdown.

Britain, along with Italy, Spain, the Czech Republic and Poland, sees Germany as being the least compassionate. The UK is seen in that less flattering light by the French and the Germans.

Self-congratulation is common in the survey conducted among more than 7,600 people in eight European countries by the Washington-based Pew Research Centre.

In fact, people of every nationality 
consider themselves to be the most compassionate people in Europe. The 
British also consider themselves the least arrogant.

Notably,
the Italians vote themselves as the least trustworthy people, but the 
most compassionate, which is exactly the opposite of the way they view 
the Germans.

Cheers to that! The Germans are almost universally judged the most trustworthy

David Cameron didn’t exactly come out of the poll smelling of roses, scoring a 37 per cent approval rating among the British public.

But he can take some comfort from the fact that he was second only to Germany’s Angela Merkel in the chart showing how European nations rated their own leaders.

As well as a 64 per cent positive rating 
in her own country, the German Chancellor also earned a 73 per cent in 
France and 58 per cent in Britain for her handling of the EU financial 
crisis. Not surprisingly, the Greeks gave her just 10 per cent.

And while the British public may have its qualms about the prime minister,  50 per cent in France think he’s doing a decent job and 58 per cent of Poles are impressed.

However, according to Pew, beyond that, Mr. Cameron’s support is weak: Just 25 per cent of the Germans and 17 per cent of the Greeks give him a good grade. And in some countries, the prime minister’s marks have declined since 2012: by 14 points in his own country and by 9 points in France.

French President Francois Hollande fares even worse. Just 33 per cent of his own people and 30 per cent of the British and the Greeks say he is doing a good job.

Based on research in Britain, France, Germany, Italy, Spain, Greece, Poland and the Czech Republic, the US research centre concludes that the EU is ‘the new sick man of Europe.’

The proportion of Europeans with a favourable view of the EU has plunged from 60 per cent last year to 45 per cent now, says the poll.

While the UK may be considered the most Eurosceptic country, but its support for the union has barely changed in the past 12 months, slipping only two points to 43 per cent. Britons quizzed in the poll are split evenly at 46 per cent on whether to pull out or stay in the EU.

By contrast, France’s backing for the union has plunged in 12 months from 60 per cent to 41 per cent.

‘The prolonged economic crisis has created centrifugal forces that are pulling European public opinion apart, separating the French from the Germans and the Germans from everyone else,’ said the report.

‘The effort over the past half century to create a more united Europe is now the principal casualty of the euro crisis. The European project now stands in disrepute across much of Europe,’ it adds.
