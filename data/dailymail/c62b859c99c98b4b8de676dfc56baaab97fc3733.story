The Blackhawks last gasp victory in the Stanley Cup on Monday night left the city of Chicago waking up to one hell of a hangover the following morning.

Celebrations on the streets of Chicago well into the night gave way to a wave of sick calls, late starts and half days on Tuesday after the team scored two very late goals to beat the Boston Bruins at 
TD Garden 3-2 and clinch the National Hockey
League's top tournament.

One expert estimated that a quarter of the city's workforce turned up late and weren't that productive when they did finally show.

The people of Chicago partied long into the night on Monday after the Chicago Blackhawks defeated the Boston Bruins 3-2 in Boston to win the Stanley Cup hockey final

A quarter of Chicago's workforce showed up for late for work the morning after Monday night's historic hockey victory

'In Chicago, 25 percent of the workforce is coming in late,' CEO John Challenger of executive outplacement firm Challenger, Gray & Christmas told CBS2.

He predicted big losses for companies.

'We see millions of dollars in productivity losses,' he said.

Challenger said national post-Super Bowl numbers are a good gauge of how a major sporting victory can be good for morale but bad for productivity.

'Up to $242 million in lost productivity for every 10 minutes of unproductive work time,' he said.

However the one place where business was brisk on Tuesday were Chicago's sport retailers who were doing a good business in Blackhawks merchandise.

Then, while the Bruins were settling 
in for another overtime in a series that has already had its share, Dave
Bolland scored to give Chicago victory.

The Blackhawks were just seventy-six 
seconds away from defeat and a trip home for a decisive seventh game, 
when Bryan Bickell tied it.

The
back-to-back scores in the time it takes for one good rush down the ice
turned a near-certain defeat into a championship clincher, stunning the
Boston players and their fans and starting the celebrations on the 
Blackhawks' bench with 59 seconds to play.

'We thought we were going home for Game 7. You still think you're going to overtime and you're going to try to win it there.Â

'Then
Bolly scores a huge goal 17 seconds later,' said Chicago forward 
Patrick Kane, who won the Conn Smythe Trophy as the postseason's most 
valuable player.

'It feels like the last 58 seconds were an eternity.'

As the players celebrated in Boston, the bars of Chicago were full to the brim with jubilant fans celebrating a second win in four years.

Fans streamed onto the streets of Chicago and their was a carnival atmosphere as the Blackhawks fans partied into the night.

Back in Boston the children of the Stanley Cup-winning Chicago Blackhawks players ventured onto the ice to celebrate their team's win, a fan of the losing Boston Bruins put rivalry aside to take their picture.

The youngsters couldn't hide their delight after the Blackhawks snatched a dramatic 3-2 victory to seal their second Stanley Cup in just four seasons.

But in a heartwarming display of sportsmanship, the Bruins' fan joined in with their celebrations and even took several victory snaps. Let's hope he sends them a copy.

The children were later pictured parading around the ice waving Blackhawks flags.

Just like in 2010, they won it in a Game 6 on the road.

'In
2010, we didn't really know what we were doing. We just, we played 
great hockey and we were kind of oblivious to how good we were playing,'
said Toews, who scored his third goal of the playoffs to tie it 1-1 in 
the second period, then fed Bickell for the score that tied it with 76 
seconds to play.

'This time 
around, we know definitely how much work it takes and how much sacrifice
it takes to get back here and this is an unbelievable group,' Toews 
said. 'We've been through a lot together this year and this is a sweet 
way to finish it off.'

The 
Blackhawks opened the season on a 21-0-3 streak and coasted to the 
Presidents' Trophy that goes to the team with the best regular-season 
record. But regular-season excellence has not translated into playoff 
success: Chicago is the first team with the best record to win the cup 
since the 2008 Detroit Red Wings.
