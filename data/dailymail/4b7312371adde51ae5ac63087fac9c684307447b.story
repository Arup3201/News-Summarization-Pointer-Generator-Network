WWE superstar and diehard Liverpool fan Sheamus visited Anfield on Monday and picked out Martin Skrtel and, more surprisingly, Raheem Sterling as players he thinks could make it as professional wrestlers.

Speaking to the Liverpool ECHO, he said: 'I think Skrtel has got a great look – he's got that skinhead look.

'To me watching him I feel like he's a bit of a gentle giant, but I think if you got him going, he would be a bit of a lunatic!

The former world champion picked out which players he thinks would make it in the wrestling ring

Martin Skrtel and... Raheem Sterling (!?) have what it takes to become good wrestlers, says Sheamus

'I think he would fit right into a WWE ring, his size and presence, I think he definitely would make a great WWE Superstar.

'Sterling as well, I'd love to see Sterling if he ever got in the ring at an early age, I reckon he would be pretty athletic as well. He could be a high-flyer!' 

The three times world champion from Dublin, who used to play as a goalkeeper, has been a Reds fan since his childhood because of the club's long list of Irish players, including 'John Aldridge, Steve Staunton and Ray Houghton'.

The 6ft 4in powerhouse couldn't resist a trip to the club's spiritual home, where he made one four-year-old's day by signing his shirt and joining him for a stroll around the pitch.

Meanwhile, Liverpool players including Jose Enrique, Suso and Alberto Moreno met with wrestling stars on Monday evening ahead of the Raw event at the Liverpool ECHO Arena.
