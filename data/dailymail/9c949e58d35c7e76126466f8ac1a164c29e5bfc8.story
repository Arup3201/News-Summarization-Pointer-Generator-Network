A small-town police department gave Santa Claus a little extra help on Christmas day. 

Officers from the Manchester Police Department in Connecticut delivered toys to children on Christmas day, in their own version of Santa's sleigh: a $250,000 armored Bearcat SWAT truck -- a vehicle designed for tactical emergency response. 

The officers cruised through town, according to the Hartford Courant, in the SWAT truck, which was all decked out in tinsel, Christmas lights, plastic candy canes, a plush Elmo doll, and a blow-up snowman on top.

'We thought it would be an opportunity to interact with kids in a way that we don't usually get to,' Sgt. Marc Hughes, supervisor of the department's community policing unit, told the Hartford Courant. 

The department collected enough toys to distribute  to 44 children. The toys were donated by the local Elks Club,  NBC Connecticut reports.

The Salvation Army and The Blue Angels Foundation, which is run by one of the department's officers, helped the team identify children in need who would receive the toys.
