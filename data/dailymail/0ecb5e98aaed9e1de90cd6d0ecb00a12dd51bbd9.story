A hospital has launched a search for an anonymous 10 year old who hand-wrote them a letter thanking staff for enabling him to be born there.

The note, in a child's scrawl and decorated with pictures and stickers and was accompanied with lollies, has touched the heart of doctors and nurses at The Northern Health hospital in Melbourne, who are keen to get in touch with the boy or girl.

The letter reads: 'To all the doctors, nurses, ambulance staff and cleaners at The Northern Hospital, I am so glad that there are people like you in the world, and hospitals in the world.
