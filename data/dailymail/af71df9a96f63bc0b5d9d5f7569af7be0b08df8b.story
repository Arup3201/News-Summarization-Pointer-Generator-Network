A Missouri police officer has been shot in the arm just a few miles away from Ferguson where riots ravaged the area overnight.

The police officer was shot just before midnight on Monday, in University City, five miles south of Ferguson, Missouri.

Civil unrest followed a grand jury decision not to indict Officer Darren Wilson with any crime for the deadly shooting of 18-year-old Michael Brown.

The unidentified police officer was reportedly shot in the arm just north of Millar Park, University City and was taken to hospital.

He did not sustain life threatening injuries and is expected to make a full recovery.

The official Twitter account of the St. Louis County Police Department confirmed the shooting, which reportedly took place at approximately 11:30 p.m. 

 'A U. City police officer has been shot. Condition is unknown. Search for suspect underway. It is unclear if related to #FergusonDecision,' the account wrote. 

During an early morning press conference, St. Louis Co. Police Chief Jon Belmar said that as far as he was aware, the shooting was 'totally unrelated' to the Ferguson protests and that his heart goes out to the officer's family.

A few miles up the road, in Ferguson, dozens of gunshots were reported within hours of the jury's controversial decision not to indict Officer Wilson over the killing of black teenager Michael Brown. 

Violence flared after the decision was announced by St Louis County Prosecutor Robert McCulloch at around 8:25pm on Monday evening, and continued throughout the evening and into early Tuesday morning.

President Barack Obama and the family of Michael Brown asked for calm. As Obama spoke live from the White House briefing room, television networks showed him on one side of the screen, and violent demonstrations in Ferguson on the other.

Angry crowds took to the streets around the Ferguson Police headquarters after the grand jury determined there was no probable cause to charge Wilson with any crime for the shooting of 18-year-old Brown this past summer.

St Louis police reported heavy gunfire late on Monday in the area near where Brown was shot and killed on August 9 and more than a dozen local businesses were razed to the ground by arsonists.

So far there have been 29 arrests, 13 injuries – and no fatalities, with police saying they have not fired any shots.
