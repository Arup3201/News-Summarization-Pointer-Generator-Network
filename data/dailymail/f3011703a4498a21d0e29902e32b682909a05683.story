It was a dress designed to make Cinderella belle of the ball… and queen of the box office.

But instead this promotional image of actress Lily James, 25, has sparked an internet backlash over whether her tiny waist was achieved by wearing a corset, or the magic of airbrush.

Yesterday the film’s director Sir Kenneth Branagh, 54, insisted no digital trickery was at work. ‘To all the airbrush conspiracy theorists I can answer now: no,’ he said.

Natural: Miss James said she did have to ‘squeeze to within an inch of my life’ to get into the corset

‘I can’t remember anybody during that ball sequence who went up next to her and didn’t go, “Oh my god!” Then they’d look round the other side. 

'I was constantly saying, “You are eating, aren’t you Lily? Let’s get Lily some soup please!” These gowns were beautifully crafted and they produced shapes that were very extreme.’ 

Miss James, best known for her role as Lady Rose MacClare in Downton Abbey, said she did have to ‘squeeze to within an inch of my life’ to get into the corset.

However, fans watching the movie’s trailer online were less convinced. American actress Sarah Ann Masse said: ‘This isn’t a normal human-sized waist, right?’ 

Another blogger wrote: ‘She has apparently undergone rib removal surgery along with losing the majority of her internal organs from aggressive corsetry or Photoshop. I’m not sure which.’

After the latest trailer for the live-action feature was released last month, many people took to Twitter with comments about the tiny waist.

Backlash: People took to the internet to debate whether the look was down to a corset, or photoshop magic 

'I have a problem with the fact that Cinderella is photoshopped to have the tiniest waist I've ever seen,' tweeted @vixennicks.

'Cinderella and her digitally remastered teenie tiny waist is the reason for my confidence issues.'

A representative for Miss James told Buzzfeed this week that the look was achieved by a corset.

Lily attended the world premiere of Cinderella last Friday night, at the Berlin Film Festival, and looked more proportionate in real life than as the Disney Princess. 

Cinderella opens in Britain next month.
