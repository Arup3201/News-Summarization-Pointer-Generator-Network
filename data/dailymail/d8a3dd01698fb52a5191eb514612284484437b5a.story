There is little doubt that the watching world will be in awe when England take to the field against Italy in Manaus in less than two weeks.

The Amazon Arena is an architectural gem in the modern style of football stadia, a design which creates the illusion that an elegant spaceship has landed in the jungle town.

Rainwater is collected in the roof to irrigate the pitch; the over- arching structure is specially built to ventilate the crowd. The 44,500, all-seater stadium will be a fitting venue for Wayne Rooney, Andrea Pirlo, Steven Gerrard and Mario Balotelli and for three further World Cup fixtures.

Carnival or chaos? Social unrest could rear it's head should Brazilians become unsettled during the World Cup

And then it will cease to have a sensible purpose. Three workers died constructing a stadium that is essentially a vanity project for local politicians and which cost £171milion - some £40m over budget.

When England depart and the World Cup circus moves on, the  stadium will be taken over by local club side Nacional. Their average attendance is 1,963.

Those facts explain the social uprising that threatens to envelop Brazil this month. For the Brazil 2014 organising committee and the Brazilian government, with a little help from FIFA, have done something truly extraordinary: they have turned a nation more obsessed with its national team than any other into opponents of the World Cup.

The most recent opinion poll has 48 per cent of Brazilians supportive of the tournament, down from 78 per cent in 2008.

‘Never before has the World Cup incited these feelings of hatred among Brazilians,’ said Ugo  Giorgetti, a prominent Brazilian film-maker and football fan.

He seems to speak for many, judging by huge street protests that accompanied last year’s Confederations Cup - demonstrations initially provoked by a hike in bus fares.

Romário, star of Brazil’s 1994 World Cup-winning team and now a socialist politician in the Chambers of Deputies, the lower house in Congress, calls the tournament ‘the biggest heist in the history of Brazil’.

It is not just the delays, the cost and the futility of the stadia that is so abhorrent this time.

We are used to obsolete arenas being abandoned after tournaments. Probe some of the extravagance a little more closely and the reason for the deep anger on the streets becomes evident.

The National Stadium in Brasilia cost £375m to build, well over budget and making the Manaus project seem positively frugal. A 141-page report by the city’s auditors has found ‘grave irregularities’ in the budget, which appears to indicate over-pricing of some materials.

‘The country of football is reacting to the waste, the unfinished infrastructure projects, the allegations of corruption, the poor quality of schools and hospitals, the poor use of resources,’ said Mailson da Nóbrega, a former finance minister of Brazil.

Some FIFA officials know the era of the major tournament has become corrupted to the point at which it is in danger of becoming obsolete, swept away like a tired old regime in a storm of social protest.

But Sepp Blatter, standing again for the presidency three years after he promised to retire following this term, does not appear to be among that group. And as FIFA has settled on Russia 2018 and Qatar 2022 for the next tournaments, we need not expect reform any time soon.

There is a contradiction within all of this, of course.

Many professional observers of Brazil are convinced that once the tournament begins, social tensions will ease and a nation that is so obsessed with its team will largely rally round.

Even the most committed opponent of the World Cup will find it hard to hold back the wave of enthusiasm that surrounds a successful Brazil side.

However, this is based on the assumption that Neymar, David Luiz, Julio Cesar and their team-mates perform. Most agree that a disappointing performance will re-ignite the fires of social protest.

The World Cup may yet reach a happy conclusion.

There will doubtless be plenty to admire in Brazil, on and off the pitch, although most of it will be in spite of, rather than because of, the organisers’ best efforts.

But when a country that is popularly defined by carnival and football can find little to celebrate in hosting the World Cup, even the most hardened FIFA executives must recognise that, without change, this celebration of football will one day cease to have a meaningful  purpose.
