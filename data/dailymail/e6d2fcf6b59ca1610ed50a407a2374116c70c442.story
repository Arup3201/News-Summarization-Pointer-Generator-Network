Juventus have been given a list of players they should sign if they want to win the Champions League in the future.

Super agent Mino Raiola named a number of players including Everton's Romelu Lukaku as must-have signings, while also reiterating keeping hold of his client Paul Pogba is vital.

Speaking to Tuttosport, the Italian revealed the stars that the Serie A champions need to buy if they want to be the best team in European football.

Keeping hold of Paul Pogba (centre) is also crucial if they want to win the Champions League in the future 

He said: 'In order to win the Champions League, Juve should keep Pogba, then sign Kishna from Ajax, Lukaku from Everton and Jonathas from Elche.

'In defence they ought to buy Rodrigo Ely from Avellino. He is the Pogba of defenders and is liked by half the football world, including Juve.

'Kishna would be a fantastic signing, as he's a mixture of Cristiano Ronaldo, Angel Di Maria and Robin van Persie. We'll see what Ajax think.'

Kishna, 20, came up through the Ajax youth academy, with the versatility to be able to play on either wings and has taken the Eredivisie by storm.

Lukaku is Everton's record signing and Belgium international who has 15 goals in 38 competitive club games this season.

Brazilian centre-forward Jonathas is currently on loan at Elche from Pescara and has nine goals and five assists in 23 La Liga games this season.

Meanwhile, Raiola also confirmed reports Juventus attempted to sign Henrikh Mkhitaryan from Borussia Dortmund but were rebuffed in their approach.

'It's true, they wanted him in January, but Borussia said he was not for sale. They might make another attempt in June.

'I'd see Mkhitaryan doing very well in the same team as Pogba.'
