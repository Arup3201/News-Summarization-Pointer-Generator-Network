Fox News presenter Sabrina Rodriguez has been accused of helping her partner shoplift

A Fox40 news anchor accused of helping her partner steal wallets worth more than $2400 has resigned from her job.

Police claim March 2013 security camera footage shows Sabrina Rodriguez, who worked as a news presenter for the TV network Fox40, helping her partner Nicholas Gray take 10 wallets, worth $2500, from a Sacramento store without paying.

Rodriguez has now been charged with grand theft, burglary and conspiracy to commit a crime.

Court documents obtained by The Desk show a Folsom Police Department officer was called to the Coach outlet store on March 24 last year after employees had been told by a witness that Gray had been seen taking wallets without paying.

A review of the in-store footage showed Rodriguez directing Gray to the wallets and helping conceal his actions as he placed them in his personal bag.

It was when Gray was arrested for an outstanding warrant in May this year that a search warrant was received to check his iPhone, and text messages were found allegedly implicating Rodriguez in the thefts.

Text message conversations between the two showed Gray telling Rodriguez: 'I got 8 $350 cashmere sweaters plus skirts I got rent'.

And in separate instance, Rodriguez responded to his texts, telling him: 'I love when a plan comes together'.

KCRA reported her lawyer said she was '100 per cent innocent' of the crimes and looked forward to defending herself in court.

Yesterday Rodriguez took to her official Facebook page to announce she had resigned from her job with Fox40.

She wrote: 'I am heartbroken to say, I have decided to resign my position at Fox40. Given the recent media attention I feel it was the best decision to make.

'The past three years at FOX40 have been absolutely wonderful. From management to my colleagues in the newsroom and other departments, everyone is talented and kind. It's been a blessing to work and learn from all of you.

'To the viewers, thank you for your incredible love and support. It's overwhelming.

Resigning was not an easy decision to make, but it's one that will allow me to focus on my case and work to reestablish my good name.'

Rodriguez was released on $10,000 bail last week and will be arraigned on August 29.

A Fox40 spokesperson recently told MailOnline: 'We were informed late Thursday July 31 that legal action has been taken against anchor Sabrina Rodriguez.

'These charges relate to a personal situation with Ms. Rodriguez that is not related to her work at Fox40.

'Sabrina maintains she is innocent of these allegations. She has been granted a voluntary leave of absence from the station.'
