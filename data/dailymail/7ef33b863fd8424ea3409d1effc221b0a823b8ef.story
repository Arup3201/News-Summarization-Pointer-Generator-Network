Blackpool have opened talks with former Arsenal winger Quincy Owusu-Abeyie. 

The Championship strugglers are continuing to piece together a squad with former Leeds striker El Hadji Diouf training with them also last week.

Owusu-Abeyie, 28, is a free agent after leaving Panathinaikos and is discussing a short-term contract.

Familiar feeling: Oriol Riera's goal consigned Blackpool to yet another defeat at Wigan 

Meanwhile, former Blackpool defender Alex Baptiste has revealed some of his frustrations at the Bloomfield Road set-up. 

Now at Blackburn, Baptiste said: 'My most bizarre football experience I would have to say is Blackpool. 

'Washing your own kit in the Premier League. In the play-off semi-final, having to walk to the ground because the bus broke down. 

No balls in training, having to run on the beach because the pitch had been frozen for two weeks, no food after training, leaks in the portacabins, having to buy your own weights - just random stuff like that! It was definitely an experience!'
