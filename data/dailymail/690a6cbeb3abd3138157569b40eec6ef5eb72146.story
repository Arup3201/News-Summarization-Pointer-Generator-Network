While South Africa's largest city Johannesburg is riddled with a high rate of crime, Wicked Campers creator John Webb claims the crime in Darwin is 'worse'.

Two vehicles from Wicked Campers were stolen on Friday night after brazen thieves broke into the budget hire company's inner-city headquarters on McMinn Street in Northern Territory.

The vehicles were locked up behind a fenced yard but a black Suzuki Alto and a white Suzuki Vitara were driven away after the thieves smashed them through the padlocked gates to escape.

Mr Webb told NT News that his business in Johannesburg has never experienced anything worse than his Darwin based operation.

'This is worse than Johannesburg,' he said.

'I know that’s pretty wild.'

Police are investigating the incident but Mr Webb said it wasn't the first time his company had been under attack.

He added that as of this week, he will have guard dogs to help patrol his yard and stop thieves from entering the premises again, NT News reports.

'If we get dogs we shouldn’t have any more trouble,' he said.

In July, Wicked Campers grabbed national headlines over its sexist slogans and art work after a Sydney mother launched a petition to have them removed from the vehicles.

Paula Orbea created the petition after her 11-year-old daughter repeated the slogan word-for-word: 'In every princess, there's a little slut who wants to try it just once'. 

It was revealed that the company promised to remove the sexist and misogynistic marketing from all of the vans within the next six months, and also issued an apology to the mother.

According to Smart Traveller, there has been a significant increase of robberies at shopping centres in and around Johannesburg.

'Crime is significantly higher after dark in the centres of major cities and in township areas. The inner suburbs of Johannesburg   are particularly prone to crime', Smart Traveller posted.

'As crime rates are generally high in the townships, you should only visit township areas with an organised tour run by a reputable company.

'Criminals operate out of the airport in Johannesburg, following some overseas visitors to their accommodation and robbing them.'

But according to Johannesburg Airport, most of the shopping malls and areas in the business district have securities or surveillance cameras installed, 'so there is a lower chance for theft or pick pocketing in the day time'.

'There are plenty of safe places to go in Johannesburg as long as you follow the safety tips. Public transport shouldn’t be used because it’s not safe.

'As long as you remain in large groups and keep your eyes and ears open, you can have a great trip to Johannesburg.'
