Oscar Pistorius is at risk of committing suicide unless he receives further treatment, according to a psychologist’s report prepared for his murder trial.

The report said the double-amputee runner is suffering depression and post-traumatic stress disorder and 'his condition is likely to worsen' if professional treatment for those conditions is halted.

It also concluded that the Paralympian does not show narcissistic traits linked with violence towards women and 'rage-type' murders.

Dr. Jonathan Scholtz, a clinical psychologist, found no evidence that Pistorius had a history of 'abnormal aggression or explosive violence' but concluded he has a record of feeling insecure and vulnerable, particularly when he is without his prosthetic limbs, defense lawyer Barry Roux said.

Roux on Wednesday read excerpts from the report, which was compiled during a 30-day observation period at a state psychiatric hospital and included a report compiled by three psychiatrists.

Oscar Pistorius is accused of murdering girlfriend Reeva Steenkamp, who he shot dead through the bathroom door of his home last year. Pistorius maintains he shot her by accident, believing her to be an intruder.

The court-ordered evaluation occurred after a psychiatrist testifying for the defense said Pistorius was suffering from an anxiety disorder that may have influenced his actions on the night he killed Steenkamp. 

Another excerpt read out from the report stated that the reaction Pistorius had on the night he killed Ms Steenkamp might seem 'seem extraordinary when viewed from the perspective of an able-bodied person, but normal in the context of a disabled person with his history'.

At times during his trial, Pistorius has wailed and retched in apparent distress, particularly during graphic testimony about the shooting and also when the athlete was on the witness stand. At other times, he has been calm and taken notes. 

Chief prosecutor Gerrie Nel has suggested Pistorius feigned distress in order to dodge a tough cross-examination; the athlete's camp has denied his emotional displays were fake. 

The defence called their last witness today, sports and exercise expert Professor Wayne Derman from the University of Cape Town.

He told the court that Pistorius, who he has treated, was 'hyper-vigilant'. He said he would constantly scan rooms for possible threats when out in public, and even look around his treatment room during one-to-one consultations in an agitated manner.

He quoted a study that found that adults with disabilities are at a higher risk of violent attacks.

He added that the athlete has a hand tremor as well as a sleep disorder that required medication. 

The defence is trying to bolster the idea that the Paralympian's purported fear of crime may have pushed him to fire through a closed toilet door and that his disability contributed to an increased sense of vulnerability.  

Pistorius’ manager Peet van Zyl was cross-examined again today, stressing that he had nothing to gain financially from being biased towards Pistorius as his contract with him has ended.

Hearing: Oscar Pistorius faces 25 years in jail if found guilty of premeditated murder

Yesterday he told the court how Oscar Pistorius had a heightened concern for his personal safety and was making plans to take girlfriend Reeva Steenkamp on international trips shortly before he fatally shot her.

The defense called Peet van Zyl to the stand in an attempt to bolster Pistorius' account that he mistook Steenkamp for an intruder, providing testimony about a loving relationship and a fear of crime that may have pushed the Paralympian to fire through a closed toilet door. 

Van Zyl faced tough questioning from the chief prosecutor, however, about Pistorius' alleged egotism and tantrums, high-speed driving and love of guns. The prosecution maintains that he intentionally killed Steenkamp in his home after an argument in the early hours of February 14, 2013. 

Pistorius, who is free on bail, faces 25 years to life in prison if found guilty of premeditated murder, but he could also be sentenced to significant time behind bars if convicted of murder without premeditation or negligent killing. He also faces gun-related charges. 

The agent, who helped guide Pistorius to success as a globally renowned athlete with lucrative sponsorship deals that have since been stripped away, testified that his client had a 'heightened sense of awareness' and appeared preoccupied with security at times. On one occasion, he recalled, Pistorius drove with him at high speed to the airport and, when told there was no rush, recalled a traumatic episode in which Van Zyl was accosted at gunpoint while in his car in 2007.

'He wanted to ensure that we are safe and not being followed,' Van Zyl said.

He also remembered a time when Pistorius grabbed him by the arm in apparent fear when the pair heard a loud bang while walking in New York City, and described two occasions in which the runner lost his temper but was not aggressive under 'abusive questioning' from journalists.

He also said he was assisting Pistorius in plans to take Steenkamp, a 29-year-old model, to races in Britain and Brazil, and a concert in Italy.

Prosecutor Gerrie Nel tried to pick holes in Van Zyl's testimony, pressing the agent for details about a reported incident in which a South African athlete who was sharing a room with Pistorius asked for them to be separated because Pistorius was allegedly arguing frequently on his telephone. He also referred to a 2012 Paralympics race in which Pistorius accused the winner of breaking the rules by using prosthetic limbs that were too long.

Van Zul acknowledged that it was the 'wrong place and wrong time for him to react in such a way' but noted there was a 'long lead-up' to the incident in which Pistorius had expressed concerns that rules were being flouted.

Nel also described Pistorius' plans to take Steenkamp on trips as an example of alleged narcissism after Van Zyl quoted the athlete as saying he wanted his girlfriend 'to see what my world is about, the pressure that I'm under' and 'how I need to perform.'

During an adjournment, Van Zyl and Pistorius shook hands. The two men patted each other warmly on the back.
