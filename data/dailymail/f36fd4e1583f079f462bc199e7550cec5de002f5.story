A former senior psychologist with the NYPD has been arrested and charged with trying to kill her husband last year during a staged home invasion. 

Mother-of-two Emily Dearden, 46, from Yonkers, New York, turned herself in after her spouse Kenneth, 47, filed a lawsuit earlier this month claiming she shot him in the back of the head in November, 2013, 'execution-style' so she could be with her married lover.

She was charged with attempted second degree murder during an arraignment hearing on Friday where she posted $150,000 bail and was ordered to stay away from her husband. 

On November 14 last year, real estate developer Mr Dearden was found with gunshot wounds at his large home in the well-to-do area where the couple lived with their two daughters. 

Court papers said he woke up with a 'searing pain in his jaw' before noticing the bed sheets were covered in blood.

Mr Dearden then found his wife on the floor downstairs, claiming she had been hit in the head by an intruder.

He also realized that the home's alarm he had set hours before had been turned off and only his wife knew the code. 

Mitchell Schuster, Mr Dearden's lawyer, told The Journal News that his client understands why it has taken so long for charges to be filed and is continuing to cooperate with detectives. 

He told the paper: 'We were always confident the authorities would go through the process and take the steps necessary to ensure an arrest. We're happy with the results so far.'

Her lover was named as Warren Roudebush, of Texas, who allegedly ended his own marriage, according to court documents seen by The New York Post.

Calls to Mr Roudebush's home went unanswered on Friday.

According to the Supreme Court lawsuit: 'With [Kenneth] no longer in the picture, [Emily] could avoid a contentious divorce, keep the marital home and never admit the marriage infidelity to any family and friends.'  

No one has been charged in the shooting at the home, worth more than $500,000 according to records, where the couple live with their young daughters. Calls to the Dearden family home were not answered on Friday.

According to Lohud.com, Mrs Dearden filed for divorce in August. 

The Westchester District Attorney's Office was unable to comment due to an ongoing criminal investigation.

In a CBS report from November 2013, Mr Dearden was alert and talking when paramedics arrived at his home after he called 911. 

Detectives at the time did not believe that his injury was self-inflicted.

A dog, believed to be the family's Rottweiler, did not react during an alleged home invasion last year 

His wife, Emily, an NYPD psychologist was treated at the scene for a minor head wound.

Mr Rearden's lawsuit reportedly said that his wife claimed she had been 'knocked out' by an intruder. 

During the home invasion, according to the lawsuit seen by The Post, the family's alarm didn't go off and the alleged intruder didn't set off the pet Rottweiler.

Mr Dearden's lawsuit also reportedly claimed that his wife refused medical treatment and washed the bed sheets and her nightgown while he was in hospital. 

He also reportedly claimed that his wife met her lover for coffee the next morning.

Police would not say who fired the weapon or if it was an accident or a crime. 

Emily Dearden was questioned last November but not charged. 

Mrs Dearden is also a professor at John Jay College of Criminal Justice in Manhattan. 

MailOnline was awaiting a comment from Emily Dearden's lawyer, Paul B. Bergman, on Friday.  

Yonkers police Lt. Patrick McCormack told The Post that the case was 'complex'. MailOnline was awaiting a response from Yonkers police on Friday. 

Meister Seelig & Fein, listed as Mr Dearden's attorneys on court documents, were unavailable for comment when contacted by MailOnline on Friday.

Mr Dearden, who is originally from Shrewsbury, Massachusetts, is President for Development at real estate company, Metro Partners and is also President of the Yonkers Downtown/Waterfront Business Improvement District.

Metro Partners website lists him as a former investment banker at JPMorgan Chase.
