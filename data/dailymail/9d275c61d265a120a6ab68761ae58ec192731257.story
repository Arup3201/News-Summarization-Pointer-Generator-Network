The White Australia Game released in 1914 had one simple objective - 'Get the Coloured Men Out and the White Men In.'

Documents from the White Australia Era which have been discovered in the National Archives give a startling insight into the explicit racism in Australian society well into the 1900s.

The rules of the game state 'Place the Men the same as the 'Game'. The puzzle required the player to get all the 'coloured' men out of Australia and replace them with 'white men'.

The White Australia Game: 'A New Australian Game For New And Old Australian People'

The game was advertised as 'A New Australian Game for New and Old Australian People', sold for a sixpence, and included two bonus puzzles.

Kate Naughtin, Education Project Officer at the National Archives of Australia told the ABC the game was 'very much to do with the White Australia Policy'.

'The aim of this game is to get them to change places, getting all the coloured men out and all the white men into Australia which very much was, I suppose, the attitude of the time,' she said.

The Immigration Restriction Act introduced in 1901 aimed to stop non-European immigration to Australia

Some families such as the Gees, were exempt from taking the Dictation Test used to keep Australia European

The game is also a reflection of the attitudes at the time, with the policy introduced with the Federation of the states into the Australian nation in 1901.

Legislation officially known as the Immigration Restriction Act was passed in 1901 which aimed to restrict non-white immigration to the country.

This legislation required all non-European people to sit for a 'Dictation Test', which last until 1958.

This required applicants to write out 50 words in any European language dictated to them by an officer.

The White Australia policy was introduced because of concerns about non-European settlement when Chinese miners came New South Wales and Victoria for the Gold Rush in the 1850s and with the arrival of Pacific Islanders to work in Queensland's cane fields.

The policy was reinforced in Second World War by Prime Minister John Curtin, but then progressively dismantled from 1949 until it was finally abolished in 1973.

Travel, education or family were often reasons individuals could be exempt from taking the test

The National Archives of Australia described the Dictation Test: 'As the language used was at the discretion of the officer, it was easy to ensure failure if an applicant was thought to be 'undesirable', either because of their country of origin, criminal record, medical history or if they were considered morally unfit.'

'Despite the restrictive legislation, many non-European immigrants, including people from Asia, did enter or continue to reside in Australia during the period of the White Australia Policy.'

Exemptions from the Dictation Test were non-European coming for a specific period to work, to visit family or for educational purposes.
