Brendan Rodgers is confident Liverpool will make home advantage pay and reach the Champions League knockout stage.

Liverpool had a frustrating Wednesday night in Sofia after they were held to a 2-2- draw by FC Ludogorets.

But they are still in control of their destiny and will progress from Group B by beating Basle on December 9, even though they were pegged back by Georgi Terziev's late header.

Brendan Rodgers gives Liverpool's Champions League verdict the thumbs up

Simon Mignolet's early blunder gifted Dani Abalo the opening goal inside three minutes

The game started in the worst possible manner for Rodgers, after Dani Abalo was gifted a third minute opener by Simon Mignolet's error. Liverpool, however, responded with goals from Rickie Lambert and Jordan Henderson.

It now becomes a question of whether Liverpool can hold their nerve and see off Basle, who were beaten 1-0 by Real Madrid. Rodgers, though, has no concerns and insists he would have been happy to be in this position when the group stages started in September.

Rodgers said: 'We are very frustrated but we needed to come and put on performance to encourage us going forward and one that gave us chance of qualifying from group and had both of them.

'The reaction to going behind was fantastic and we showed real character. We fell behind to team that's done really well here.

'But we showed spirit with the quality of goals. Of course, we are frustrated at the end because we had defended so well. We could have been two or three in front but we have come away with a point.

'Real Madrid beat Basle and I said at start it could come down to the last game. To have the last game at Anfield, needing to win to go through, I would have taken that.'

Rodgers refused to point the blame at Mignolet, who had been earlier been criticised by former Liverpool keeper Bruce Grobbelaar.

'Hopefully it is not an issue with his confidence,' said Rodgers. 'It was a disappointment for the team because we wanted a solid start and to go behind so early very frustrating. Thankfully it didn't cost us overall.

'The pitch was difficult for the outfield players and the goalkeepers; it was very bobbly, especially around the box. Thankfully it didn't cost us overall and the players showed great character to come back.

'We haven't been consistent enough in our performances and that's my responsibility. But in the Champions League, we still have it in our hands. It was always going to be a close group, Basle have experience in the competition.

Lambert justified his inclusion in the starting XI with his second goal in as many matches

'But thankfully we have had a good result. We would have liked to have won but we can't ask for more than having to win your last game at home, which I felt would be the case at the start of the competition. I will take that.'

Lambert vindicated Rodgers' decision to start him after his goal at Crystal Palace and the England international believes this performance was a riposte for the criticism that followed the debacle at Crystal Palace.

'It was my first start in the Champions League and it was good to score,' said Lambert. 'We are devastated about the goal at the end but it was about the performance today - win, lose or draw - and the performance was better.

'We have answered some of our critics about Sunday against Crystal Palace. It was about the win and we almost got it. Now we have to go for an even better performance on Saturday.'
