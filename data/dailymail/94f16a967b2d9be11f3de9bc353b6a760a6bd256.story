Sports car company Porsche is asking more than 100 UK owners of the latest 911 GT3 models to stop driving them while tests go on following cases of vehicles catching fire.

The advice, to 101 UK owners who have paid around £100,000 for their vehicles, has gone out to a total of 785 owners worldwide of the GT3s from the 2014 model year.

Porsche said there had been two cases in Europe of cars catching fire. There were no accidents or injuries.

The two vehicles caught alight in Switzerland and in Italy. The incidents were said to be the result of 'engine damage'.

The company said: 'Porsche is inspecting all engines of 911 GT3 vehicles of model year 2014.

'Porsche is informing the owners of the affected vehicles directly and recommending that they stop using their vehicles. The company is offering to pick up the vehicles and take them to a Porsche centre immediately.'

Porsche went on: 'Safety is a number one priority at Porsche, and the company takes its responsibility seriously.

'After engine damage occurred in two vehicles in Europe and the vehicles then caught fire, Porsche decided to inspect all 785 delivered vehicles worldwide.

'There was no traffic accident and no personal injuries. Internal studies to determine the cause of the engine damage have not been completed yet.'

Police in Switzerland released this image of a Porsche which caught in St Gallen earlier this month (Porsche has not confirmed that this is the GT3 that caught fire in Switzerland)

It was reported on blog Axis of Oversteer last week that Porsche had put a stop sale on the model after the fires.

This came after police in St Gallen, Switzerland, reported a Porsche catching fire on February 5.

According to the police, the driver heard ‘strange noises’ coming from the engine and left the highway.

Shortly after getting out of the car, it set alight for unknown reasons and had to be extinguished by fire fighters.
