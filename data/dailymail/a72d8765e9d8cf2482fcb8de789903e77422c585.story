Super-agent Jorge Mendes has heaped praise on Cristiano Ronaldo by claiming the Ballon d'Or winner is a great role model for kids.

Ronaldo picked up yet another award on Monday when he beat off competition from Lionel Messi and Manuel Neuer to win the prestigious title for the third time.

Mendes, who helped Ronaldo seal moves to Manchester United and Real Madrid in 2003 and 2009 respectively, believes the 29-year-old's ambition to reach the top will have a positive influence on youngsters.

Speaking after the Ballon d'Or ceremony, Mendes said: 'He is a great professional and that is fundamental today for a player to perform better on the pitch. Cristiano is a professor.

'Cristiano is an example for the boys who want to triumph, who want to go on to become the best in the world. He is also a great example for our society and our country, to make us more determined, more ambitious. He is an example for the youngsters and the adults.

'He has never stood with his arms folded. He always wanted to be better and he has that same ambition today.'

Portuguese football agent Mendes, who advises the likes of Angel di Maria, James Rodriguez and David de Gea, insists fellow countryman Ronaldo is the 'best player in history'.

'At the age of 16, he was the best in the world for his age. At 17, too. He has always been the best,' added Mendes.

'People say he is so good because he is strong now physically but, at the age of 16, he was already doing all those amazing dribbles he does, taking on players. He had so much quality.

'He is the best player in history and there will never be another one like him.'
