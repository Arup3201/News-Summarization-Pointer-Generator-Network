The NHS is running out of money and will be unable to meet the needs of the soaring population, the elderly and the obese, a top doctor has warned.

Dr Mark Porter, the chairman of the British Medical Association's council, said the financial outlook was dire and the health service was 'struggling just to keep pace' with rising demand.

He said the situation is so bleak that if the NHS was a country, it would 'barely have a credit rating', putting it on a par with Afghanistan and Iraq.

Dr Mark Porter has said NHS finances are in 'dire' shape, with the service struggling 'just to keep pace'

In a stark warning, Dr Porter said the
 health service will have to make 'fundamental changes' which could lead
 to routine treatments and procedures being cut.

And
 he said that within the next ten years, if funding only keeps pace with
 inflation, the NHS could have annual debts of up to £54billion as 
patient demand far outstrips the money it gets from the Treasury.

The
 health service has an annual budget of £106billion and unlike other 
Government departments it has been ring-fenced from public service cuts 
over the past three years.

But there is mounting concern among doctors 
and healthcare leaders that even if this level of income is guaranteed, 
the service will not be able to meet the soaring demand.

This
 is because of the rising population, increased numbers of elderly, the 
effects of obesity and alcohol and the cost of expensive new medicines.

In
 a message to the BMA, the doctors' union, Dr Porter said: 'The 
financial outlook is dire. The NHS is struggling just to keep pace.

He blamed the rising cost of treatment, the ageing population, and obesity for rising costs

'A
 growing and ageing population, public health problems like obesity, and
 constant advances in treatment and technology are all contributing to 
push NHS costs well above general inflation. The numbers overall are so 
bad that if the NHS was a country, it would barely have a credit rating 
at all.'

He said that NHS 
staff had 'borne the brunt' of the Government's  efficiency drive – the 
health service has been asked to find £20billion in efficiency savings 
by 2015.

'The National Audit Office said the NHS had made the “easiest” savings first,' he said.

'They
 were certainly not easy for the doctors and other healthcare staff who 
were made to bear the brunt. And it is not easy for the patients and 
staff every time a vacancy is not filled, a ward is closed, or a clinic 
is cancelled.'

Earlier this month, another senior healthcare leader suggested routine treatments would have to be cut.

David
 Flory, head of the NHS Trust Development Authority,  the hospital 
watchdog, said there were a 'number of organisations facing really 
significant financial pressures'.

At a meeting at the King's Fund think-tank in London, he said there were at least 30 hospital trusts  facing serious problems.

Mr Flory said: 'We've simply had too much uncertainty in the first half of the financial year.'

He
 warned of a 'build-up of more patients nobody can afford to pay for' 
and said the NHS would have to 'take out capacity' or cut services. It 
is not clear which treatments or procedures currently available on the 
NHS would be slashed, but some areas are already rationing hip and knee 
replacements and  cataract treatment.

Leading
 figures have suggested charging patients for services which are 
currently free, such as GP home visits and even hospital stays.

He also criticsed Jeremy Hunt for suggesting that GPs contracts had lead to increased waiting times at A&E, calling the remarks 'attacks on our professionalism'

Earlier
 this year the NHS Confederation, which represents healthcare managers, 
said patients could be made to pay £8.50 every time they call out a 
doctor.

And a poll by Pulse 
magazine in July found that half of GPs were in favour of charging 
patients for appointments, with fees ranging from £5 to £25.

A
 spokesman for the Department of Health said: 'We know the NHS needs to 
change to meet the needs of an ageing population and increasing demand 
on services.

'Dr Porter 
acknowledges that it  is possible to achieve efficiencies and still 
improve care, and that is exactly what the NHS must continue to do.

'We
 have protected the overall health budget and we also recently announced
 plans to invest £3.8billion to improve the way health and social care 
services join up.

'This 
amounts to a major shift of resources to prevention of ill health. We 
are also bringing back named GPs for vulnerable elderly patients so that
 they get the care they need and prevent unnecessary trips to hospital 
and A&E.'
