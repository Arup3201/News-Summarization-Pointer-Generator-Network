Fired: Top gang prosecutor Deanna Rodriguez has lost her job over allegations of slurs

The head of the gang bureau at Brooklyn's District Attorney has been fired after a series of alleged slurs, including calling a leading prosecutor 'the head n****r'.

Deanna Rodriguez had been suspended in March, without pay, after referring to interns, paralegals and assistant district attorneys as 'faggots' and 'dykes'.

The 52-year-old allegedly sent an email to a female colleague containing physical threats and homophobic slurs.

An investigation into the behavior of Ms Rodriguez, who earned about $160,000 a year, revealed she had also used racist slurs.

She was fired by Brooklyn district attorney Charles 'Joe' Hynes on Friday.

'After complete review of her conduct, she was terminated effective immediately,' Jerry Schmetterer, spokesman for the district attorney's office, told the New York Post.

Former colleagues praised Ms Rodriguez's leadership in the department, which she had run since 1996.

However, others said she had a volatile reputation, adding 'She's a wild woman. She's nuts.'

Several complaints had been made about Ms Rodriguez by employees, including one with the federal 
Equal Employment Opportunity, the New York Post was told.

'When this issue first arose, Deanna 
Rodriguez was immediately suspended for 90 days without pay,' Mr Schmetterer told the Daily News.

While she was suspended, an internal investigation found she had referred to an African-American employee, believed to be counsel to the district attorney, Lance Ogiste, as 'the head n****r'.

Brooklyn's District Attorney's Office, which handles about 1,500 cases a week, is currently featuring in a reality show on CBS.

Re-election: Brooklyn District Attorney Charles Hynes is facing an election after holding his post for 23 years

The head of unit, Mr Hynes, is credited with innovative approaches to crime, such as a gun buy-back scheme that was rolled out across New York City.

However, the 78-year-old, who has been district attorney for 23 years, is facing a tough election campaign against Indian and African American candidates in September, the Huffington Post said.

Ms Rodriguez refused to comment on whether she believed she had been wrongly fired, and whether she would dispute the firing.

'This is about vilifying me,' she said. 'It’s not the right story. I’m not prepared to talk.'

The acting head of the Gang Bureau is now Executive Assistant District Attorney Edward Carroll.
