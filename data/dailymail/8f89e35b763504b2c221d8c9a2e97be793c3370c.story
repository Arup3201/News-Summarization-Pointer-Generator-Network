The Duke and Duchess of Cambridge are a step closer to moving in to their new country home after builders finished re-roofing the house.

Anmer Hall, on the Sandringham estate in Norfolk, has had its roof covered in traditional clay pantiles which have rendered it a bright shade of orange.

Roofers apparently worked flat-out to get the tiles in place and make the building watertight in time for the Christmas break.

Finished: The new bright orange roof has been installed on Anmer Hall on the Sandringham estate in Norfolk

New country house: The Duke and Duchess of Cambridge are set to move in to the home

Controversial: Some locals have compared the new colour of the roof to 'a vulgar Barratt home'

Some locals have previously criticised the renovation, saying it makes the house look like 'a vulgar Barratt home', although the tiles are expected to lose their bright hue as they weather over the next year.

Despite the completion of the new roof, the 200-year-old hall will not be ready for its new inhabitants for some time yet.

Much of the building, which was previously leased from the Queen as a private home, is still covered in scaffolding, while a skip has been left in the driveway.

It is believed that work on the house has been hampered by poor weather conditions in recent weeks as well as the short days.

Building works: Roofers work on the house replacing the tiles; they have finished in time for Christmas

Work in progress: The house will not be ready for the Cambridges to move in until the New Year

Upgrade: The house has undergone numerous renovations, including security measures

Dormer windows set into the roof have been boarded up as they await new frames to replace ones which have rotted away.

Many members of the Royal Family will be spending Christmas at Sandringham - the Queen and the Duke of Edinburgh arrived last Friday, while others are expected tonight or tomorrow.

Villagers believe that William and Kate will pay a visit to Anmer during their stay on the estate in order to check up on the progress of the building work.

Last year, the couple broke with tradition by spending Christmas together at the Middleton family home.

Stately home: The house will be a country retreat for the couple, who live in Kensington Palace

Much of the work at Anmer Hall has involved installing security equipment to protect the couple, while contractors connected a new underground electricity cable to the hall last week.

King's Lynn and West Norfolk Borough Council approved a range of improvements at the hall including a new driveway sweeping across a field.

But workers have still not finished the driveway and a new gate which is being installed further down a lane to give the couple more privacy.

A garden room measuring 16ft by 16ft is also being added on the kitchen, overlooking a patio with a pergola constructed of stone columns with oak beams.

Family: William and Kate will be spending this Christmas at Sandringham with the Queen

Security has been stepped up with new signs erected warning that the area is 'strictly private' and that trespassing is a criminal offence.

Two marked police cars have been guarding the entrances to the hall every day.

The Duke and Duchess recently moved into their new London home - the 21-room Apartment 1A at Kensington Palace, which has been renovated at a cost to taxpayers of Â£1.1million.

But all the work to Anmer Hall will be paid for by the Royal Family as it is privately owned by the Queen.

A villager said: 'It appears that no expense is being spared for William and Kate. Everything at the hall is being done to a very high standard.'
