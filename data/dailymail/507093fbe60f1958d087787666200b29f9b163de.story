Five bus drivers and one of their wives have crucified themselves, driving 38cm nails through their hands into wooden crosses in a union protest over sackings in Paraguay.

The gruesome demonstration, which is taking place near the bus terminal at Luque, 12km outside the capital Asuncion, began 20 days ago.

Each protester has been positioned next to an empty coffin and all have vowed to continue until they are given their jobs back.

Union official Juan Villalba, who is 
leading the demonstration, claims eight drivers were fired after asking 
that for overtime pay, medical insurance and state pension 
contributions.

On Wednesday Mr Villalba's wife, Maria Concepcion Candia, 39, joined her husband in a show of solidarity.

Some of the
protesters are reportedly suffering health problems, including high fever, 
stomach and chest pains. Four other trade union members have been on hunger strike for 36 days.Â

Mr Villalba, told AFP: 'Our
position is clear: we want the eight drivers to be reinstated with all 
employee benefits. Otherwise the strike is not lifted.'

He claims some 50 drivers working for the bus company which serves the capital have worked for years without receiving any benefits.

Company manager Aufredi Paredes said five of the drivers will be re-hired, but the rest will receive legal separation payments.
