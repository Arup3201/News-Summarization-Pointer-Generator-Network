Two fishermen whose boat capsized off the coast of Florida have been rescued after 17 hours at sea.

Justyn Bradley and Cory Bowman were fishing off Jupiter Inlet near Fort Pierce Sunday when a 12-foot wave toppled their 21-foot boat.

The men clung to the bobbing vessel throughout the night, as a plane went over but didn't spot them. But they were thankfully rescued by the Coast Guard and a civilian boat Monday morning.

'It was just strong will and knowing that you will be rescued,' Bradley told WPBF of surviving the ordeal. 'Our phones are gone, radio gone, everything. You've got nothing.'

According to Bradley, the giant wave capsized their vessel 'in a matter of seconds.'

'It was a sheer wall [of water],' Bradley said. 'It broke over the boat. There was no time to think of what happened. It rolled the boat instantly.'

He said he was thrown 'about 30 feet off the boat.'

'My buddy went down and we came up and surfaced,' he added to WPBF.

Neither were injured thankfully, and they managed to save a small cooler containing around three days' worth of food and water, which they credit with their survival.

They then scrambled to get on top of the capsized boat and began the long wait for help to arrive.

The two were on the boat for some 17 hours as it floated from Jupiter to Fort Pierce.

Fortunately, the two men had told their wives exactly where they planned to fish during the trip so when they didn't return as planned Sunday evening, their concerned families alerted the Coast Guard.

'We had to go through a whole night where a plane came close and left, and didn't [see us] and left,' Bradley told WPBF.

Around 8:30 Monday morning, a Coast Guard air crew spotted them. They were about 50 miles off the coast from where they set out.

'We saw a big plane come in,' Bradley said. 'When that one turned in on us, we knew we were going to make it.'

Around the same time, a civilian boat also spotted Bradley and Bowman and came over to help. Coast Guard cameras captured the good Samaritans pull them to safety.

Miraculously, the friends escaped without injury, though they were treated for exhaustion and dehydration.

'Thanks to everyone involved,' Bradley told the station. 'If it wasn't for them, I wouldn't be here today.'

He added a word of warning to other anglers: 'Let people know where you're going, let them know what your plan is. Outside of that, you got nothing... and be in contact with them, in case something like this happens so you can be found.'
