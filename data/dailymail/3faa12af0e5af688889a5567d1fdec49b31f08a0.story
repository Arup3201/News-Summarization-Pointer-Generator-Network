Lucas Piazon wants to follow in the footsteps of goalkeeper Thibaut Courtois by using his loan spell to get his Chelsea career going.

The Brazilian, currently at Bundesliga club Frankfurt, finds himself on  loan  for the third time in less than two years, but insists he intends to tie down a first-team place at Stamford Bridge or look elsewhere.

'At the moment I'm sitting on the bench (with Frankfurt), so it's difficult to make an impression,' the 20-year-old told Goal. 'I'll keep on working to play for Chelsea or some other club in the future.'

Born: Brazil, January 20 1994 (age 20)

2012-NOW: Chelsea (1 app, 0 gls)

2013-2013: Malaga (loan) (11, 0)

Courtois spent three years with reigning La Liga champions Atletico Madrid before returning to become Chelsea's first-choice goalkeeper ahead of Premier League veteran Petr Cech.

Piazon, who joined Chelsea in 2011, has had loan spells with La Liga's Malaga and Eredivisie's Vitesse, but knows he must compete with Eden Hazard, Oscar, Mohamed Salah, Willian and Andre Schurrle for a place.

Despite the daunting task, Courtois remains proof that it can be done under Jose Mourinho.

'It's different with (Courtois), he has already made a name for himself and played for Atletico, a big club in Europe,' adds the forward.

Courtois joined La Liga club Atletico Madrid on loan between 2011 and 2014 before returning to Chelsea

'I'm much younger and have to try to do a good job. When I can't play for Chelsea, then for another club.

'In the Netherlands (with Vitesse) we were in the title race for a long time. In Spain I had a great time, because we played in the Champions League with Malaga. 

'So I can't complain, these clubs helped me a lot and, I hope, this year in Frankfurt will help me develop further.'

Piazon plays in the Bundesliga at the moment but is eager to return to the Premier League with Chelsea
