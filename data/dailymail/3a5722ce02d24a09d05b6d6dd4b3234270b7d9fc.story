Escape: Craig Goldstone, 28, had been arrested on suspicion of dragging a drunken schoolgirl into bushes and attacking her

Police officers were left with nothing but a picture when a rape suspect posing for his mugshot bolted through an open door and escaped, a court heard.

Craig Goldstone, 28, had been arrested on suspicion of dragging a drunken schoolgirl into bushes and attacking her.

He was taken into custody where he was placed in front of a camera for his official booking photo.

But seconds after the snap was taken he ran out an open door and fled the police station - leaving police with just his photo.

The suspected rapist was on the run from Plymouth's Charles Cross police station for several hours before officers managed to hunt him down, a court heard.

Details of the escape on July 5 emerged at Plymouth Crown Court where Goldstone denies rape.

Prosecutor Lee Bremridge said: 'What happened next was extraordinary. As he was waiting at the police station for his photograph to be taken, he bolted.

'He ran off from the police station through an open door and ran into the centre of Plymouth. A police manhunt was started and in fact he was found later that night.'

The court head Goldstone was out walking his dog in a park when he noticed the victim drinking with a friend.

After allegedly waiting for the friend to leave, Goldstone pounced on the girl who had drunk so much cider she was sick and could not stand, it was said.

'The defendant dragged her to some bushes near where they were sat and raped her,' Mr Bembridge added.

Goldstone was arrested at a local hostel a day after the alleged attack. The court heard that DNA found on the girl's body was matched to a sample taken from him.

The court also watched a video interview of the girl in which she admitted she had been 'paralytic' that night.

Ali Rafati, defending Goldstone, suggested the girl had asked the defendant for sex.

The trial continues.

Sorry we are unable to accept comments for legal reasons.
