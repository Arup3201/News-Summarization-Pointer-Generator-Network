A Queensland father turned vigilante chases down suspected robbers, catches shoplifters and snatches car keys from drink drivers.

And he has the video footage to prove it.

Kev Martin, from Logan in Brisbane's south, has been a shopping centre security guard for 22 years, apprehending shoppers with sticky fingers.

But in his spare time, the father-of-seven - known affectionately as the Kevinator - continues his work by nabbing those who break the law and documents it.

In dramatic footage shown on A Current Affair, Mr Martin has helped catch an array of suspects from those who shoplift to a suspected drink driver who runs a red light and collides with a pregnant woman's vehicle.

The alleged drink driver - a woman who is seen to be slurring her speech - starts abusing Mr Martin when he takes her keys out of the ignition after the collision.

The woman then starts throwing things at an unseen person who is by the passenger door.

'She is clearly freaking out, she's all over the shop and just punches the ambulance officer,' Mr Martin said.

'I just immediately threw her out of the car and pin her to the ground so the ambulance officers (can do their job).'

In another incident, Mr Martin spots smoke billowing into the sky from a house on the way to work.

He was the first one on the scene at the house fire and tried to save the family dog who was thought to be stuck inside.

Failing to find the dog, Mr Martin got the residents away from the house just in case they were in danger.

Luckily firefighters were able to locate the dog after they arrived.

But Mr Martin's jurisdiction extends into other states.

While holidaying in Melbourne, Mr Martin caught a man taking $700 worth of cosmetics and forced him to empty his pockets on camera.

'It just keeps coming and you can see my face in this video clip here. I'm shocked at how much he's got,' Mr Martin said.

'I think it was 26 bottles.'

To be in the right place at the right time, Mr Martin tunes into police radios to keep tabs on offenders.

'You see this face you'll get caught. That's for sure,' he warned.

Mr Martin is a trained security guard, so police advise people not to confront someone breaking the law. If a crime is witnessed call triple-0.
