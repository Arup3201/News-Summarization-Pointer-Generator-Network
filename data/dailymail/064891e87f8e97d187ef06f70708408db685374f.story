Ban: Australian Prime Minister Kevin Rudd has announced a ban on all boat refugees settling in the country

Australian Prime Minister Kevin Rudd has banned all illegal boat refugees from ever settling in the country.

Mr Rudd announced on Friday that all new unauthorised asylum-seekers will be sent to Papua New Guinea under a regional resettlement deal, declaring future boat refugees will have 'no chance' of staying in Australia as refugees.

The tough move is designed to prevent people smugglers exploiting refugees and taking vast sums of money putting them on leaky wooden boats with false promises that they will be able to make Australia their home.

In a blunt message to the people traffickers, Mr Rudd said: 'Your business model is over.

'These are nothing but false hopes,' said Mr Rudd, who added that Australia would continue to take 'large numbers' of genuine asylum-seekers through its refugee resettlement programme.

The Prime Minister said he would impose the changes as soon as possible as he signed the agreement with the promise that there be no cap on the number of asylum-seekers being sent to PNG's Manus Island detention centre.

'From now on, any asylum-seeker who arrives in Australia by boat will have no chance of being settled in Australia as refugees,' Mr Rudd said in Brisbane at a press conference with PNG Prime Minister Peter O'Neill.

'Asylum-seekers taken to Christmas Island will be sent to Manus and elsewhere in Papua New Guinea for assessment of their refugee status.

'If they are found to be genuine refugees they will be resettled in Papua New Guinea - an emerging economy with a strong future, a robust democracy which is also a signatory to the United Nations refugees convention.

'If they are found not to be genuine refugees they may be repatriated to their country of origin or be sent to a safe third country other than Australia.'

Mr Rudd said the agreement did not specify an absolute limit to the number of refugees who could be resettled.

'Some will say it's too hard-line, others will say it's inadequate,' Mr Rudd said of his plan, as he sought to present it as a 'balanced' approach that lay between the opposing camps on border protection policy.  

With a federal election looming, Mr Rudd has been under fire from the Liberal Opposition for doing nothing to stop the boats.

He said: 'Our responsibility as a government is to ensure that we have a robust system of border security and orderly migration, on the one hand, as well as fulfilling our legal and compassionate obligations under the refugees convention on the other.”

Immigration Minister Tony Burke said the new regime applied immediately - starting with those asylum seekers on board a vessel intercepted earlier yesterday.

He said: 'People who are currently within the detention network - within Australia on Manus or on Nauru - do not have these rules apply to them.

'But from now, on vessels that are intercepted will have the new rules apply to them and it will be a couple of weeks because of the health checks ... before the first transfers take place.'

Mr Rudd said the arrangement would apply for the next 12 months, and be subject to annual review.

He said: 'Our expectation ... is as this regional resettlement arrangement is implemented, and the message is sent loud and clear back up the pipeline, the number of boats will decline over time as asylum-seekers then make recourse to other, more normal UNHCR processes to have their claims assessed.'

He acknowledged that the change would be subject to a court challenge and would add to budget outlays.

The Prime Minister unveiled today's agreement in the hope it will undermine the selling points used by people-smugglers, who have sent more than 15,000 asylum-seekers to Australia so far this year.

While the Coalition has dismissed Mr Rudd's ability to put his tough talk into action, Mr Rudd is using the new plan to try to address a major political vulnerability ahead of the federal election.

Tony Abbott immediately welcomed the initiative as a 'very promising development'.

'But it will never work with Mr Rudd in charge,' the Coalition leader said.

He said it was Labour's fifth go at dealing with asylum-seekers and today's agreement remained about processing 'not stopping the boats'.

Neither Mr Rudd nor Mr O'Neill would say how many asylum-seekers would be sent to PNG, despite speculation earlier today that the arrangement would be capped at about 3000 people.

Mr O'Neill said: 'We will take as much as we can with the capacities that we have on the ground.

'As you know we are building more capacity to take more refugees and asylum-seekers.

'You can't simply estimate a number given you don't know how many people are seeking such refugee status in the boats that are arriving.

'We are hoping that the boats will stop and there will be nobody coming to Manus, and that is the objective of this arrangement.'

Mr Rudd said Australia and PNG would deliver the message 'loud and clear' to people-smuggling networks and criminal elements within Australia helping them.

Discussions: Mr Rudd hoped those Nauru arrangements would be built on in the future. He said he had spoken with UN Secretary-General Ban Ki-moon (pictured) about the plan

The hopes they offer their customers for the future are nothing but false hopes,' he said.

He acknowledged the implementation of the new regional approach would not be smooth.

He added: 'We are bound to run into many unanticipated problems. We will tackle them one by one.'

Australia will continue its cooperative offshore processing arrangements with Nauru.

Mr Rudd hoped those Nauru arrangements would be built on in the future. He said he had spoken with UN Secretary-General Ban Ki-moon about the plan.

Australia also plans to convene an international conference of transit and destination countries to consider how to improve global arrangements for refugees.

The conference would consider the adequacy of processing arrangements and how Australia, the US, Canada and other countries could deal better with the resettlement issues.

Mr Rudd said Australia would also seek to develop more regional arrangements at a similar conference due to be hosted by Indonesia.

He said: We will also be working with regional partners on visa arrangements for certain countries around the world that have become source countries for irregular people movements.'

The new policy increases federal spending on border protection to support an agreement with Papua New Guinea that will see the detention centre on Manus Island expanded from the previous plan to lift its capacity to 600.

In exchange for PNG's agreement, Australia will fund further aid initiatives.

These include redeveloping a major referral hospital in Lae, PNG's second largest city, and assisting with its long-term management.

Australia will also supply half the funding to reform PNG's university sector and in 2014 implement the recommendations of an Australia-PNG education review.
