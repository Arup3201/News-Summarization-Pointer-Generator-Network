Schoolies could face being banned from the Gold Coast or slapped with heavy fines under new laws in a bid to crack down on drunken and troublemaking behaviour.

Queensland police have issued a blunt warning to school leavers from all over Australia, who are preparing to head to the annual event in Surfers Paradise of Queensland from November 22.

The new laws will enable police to remove anyone causing a public nuisance, drug-related problems, violence or misbehaving from the Gold Coast or those who go against the ban will face heavy fines of more than $8000, according to the Herald Sun.

More than 250 officers will maintain a highly visible patrol through streets and hotels during the week-long festival.

Major Events Group Sen-Sgt Ben Nielsen told the Herald Sun that the new laws are an ‘extremely effective tool to remove troublemakers early and remove intoxicated people early.’

‘If you’re from interstate and you get issued with one of those on your first night, effectively you’re not allowed back into the nightclub precinct for the duration of your stay,’ Sen-Sgt Nielsen said.

The new laws will enable police to ban anyone causing public nuisance, drug-related problems, violence or misbehaving from the Gold Coast CBD for 10 days

He also issued a blunt warning about the party drugs after the death of 19-year-old Georgina Bartter, who attended music festival Harbourlife in Sydney over the weekend.

‘It’s not the time to experiment and the tragedy that happened in Sydney on the weekend highlights that,’ Sen-Sgt Nielsen told the Herald Sun.

‘You just do not know what this stuff is made up with – there is no purity to it, there is no consistency to it.’

Well behaved party-goers are encouraged to send in videos, photographs and report crimes through a phone app, designed to dispatch police to the scene

Schoolies is the annual celebration by year 12 students following the culmination of their HSC exams

For the first time, well behaved party-goers are encouraged to send in videos, photographs and report crimes through a ‘Policelink’ phone application, designed to dispatch police to the scene.

Chief Superintendent Des Lacy told the Gold Coast Bulletin that the app is designed to take a ‘30 second video or still image of illegal or dangerous behaviour and immediately send it to police’.

‘Officers can use the short video or photograph as evidence to take action so we are encouraging all Schoolies, or anyone for that matter, to download this app and use it to contact police,’ he said.
