Athletes could perform better if they choose to get physical in the bedroom the night before a performance instead of getting involved in complicated exercises where they have to use their brain.

A new study from Swinburne University in Melbourne has shown that runners didn't reach their peak if they had undertaken cognitive tasks beforehand.

Dr Clare MacMahon's research suggests that your brain should be rested before physical activity.

Taking on cognitive activities before exercise can decrease your performance

Runners could be better off having sex in the bedroom that using their brain the night be a perforamance

Dr MacMahon, who was working with German researchers, came up with this theory after putting 20 German runners to the test to investigate the effect of cognitive fatigue on physical performance.

The experienced runners performed two 3,000-metre runs on an indoor track, once after cognitive fatigue, and the other under non-fatigued conditions.

Before the second run, the participants had to press the relevant keys on a keyboard as they appeared on the screen for 90 minutes - while another group watched documentary, The Age reported. 

The group who participated in the screen exercise ran slower than the group watching TV.  

Completion times were 'significantly slower' in the cognitive fatigue condition, the paper titled Cognitive fatigue effects on physical performance during running, stated.

'Specifically, cognitive fatigue increased the perception of exertion, leading to lesser performance on the running task,' the report said which was published in the Journal of Sport & Exercise Psychology. 

'While previous research has examined the impact of cognitive tasks on physical tasks, this is the first study to examine a self-paced physical task, showing that cognitive activity indeed contributes significantly to overall performance.'

Would reading a book about sex increase or decrease your performance?
