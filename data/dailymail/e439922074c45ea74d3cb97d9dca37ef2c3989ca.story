Clutching a battered Kalashnikov and with her hair drawn back in a tight headscarf, this is the woman fighter leading the battle against Islamic State in Kobane.

Narin Afrin is commander of the Peshmerga troops defending the besieged Syrian town.

The battle-hardened Peshmerga have proved the jihadis’ most fearsome opponents, and have doggedly refused to give in to the fanatics’ assault.

Scroll down for videos. 

The commander of the Peshmerga forces, dubbed the Peshmerga Princess, defending the besieged Syrian town of Kobane against IS advances is 40-year-old Mayssa Abdo, who uses the nom de guerre Narin Afrin. She has revealed: 'Thousands of civilians are still inside the town. They can’t go anywhere – all around us is blocked'

The so-called holy warriors of IS – also known as Isis – will be humiliated by the fact that a woman is leading the stubborn fight against them, say their opponents.

IS gunmen view women as little more than slaves so being killed by one will be doubly shameful.

Yesterday on social media she was being lionised by supporters.

Commander of the Islamic State terrorists attacking the besieged Syrian town of Kobane is Abu Khattab al-Kurdi

Maajid Nawaz, the chairman of the counter-extremist Quilliam Foundation in London, wrote on Twitter: ‘Hero. Remember her name: Nalin Afrin. General commander of Kurdish forces defending city of Kobane against Isis scourge’.

The United Nations has warned of ‘another Srebenica massacre’ if Kobane falls.

Yesterday the 40-year-old Peshmerga commander issued a desperate plea to the world to arm her volunteer army.

Afrin – described as ‘beautiful, innocent and strong’ – wrote: ‘We will fight until the last bullet to save the civilians. It is a fight for all of us, a fight for freedom.

‘If you don’t help us, they will come for you one day.’

She begged the world to send anti-tank weapons, saying her fighters were being out-gunned by Islamic State’s American tanks – looted from the Iraqi army.

‘IS are using heavy weapons, especially tanks. Unfortunately we don’t have anti-tank weapons.

‘We are still defending the town, but our weapons are only very light and we have limited bullets,’ she said.

Peshmerga have released two propaganda videos in the last 24 hours (presumably in response to the IS video seen over the weekend)  purporting to show fighting in the besieged Syrian town of Kobani

‘Please send us humanitarian aid and weapons now. Thousands of civilians are still inside the town.

‘They can’t go anywhere – all around us is blocked.’

Her Peshmerga Kurds have been locked in a life-and-death battle for Kobane that has lasted a month.

Her opposite number in command of the jihadi forces attacking the town is said to be Abu Khatab al Kurdi.

Twitters users have been comparing the two commanders, with one saying the straggly-bearded fanatic was ‘ugly and wild’ while ‘the other is beautiful, innocent and strong’.

The Peshmerga have many women fighters, including teenage girls, along with boys, men and even old people, all desperately trying to stop the town falling into IS hands.

And some of the US-led air strikes in Syria and Iraq have been conducted by women.

Major Mariam Al Mansouri, 35, the United Arab Emirates’s first woman fighter pilot, has taken part in attacks on IS targets, prompting delight on social media with one commentator writing: ‘Hey Isis you were bombed by a woman, have a nice day.’

Yesterday the battle raged for Kobane with neither side seeming to make much headway.

An Islamic State suicide bomber detonated a truck laden with explosives near the Turkish border crossing.

Idris Nassan, a Kurdish official in Kobane, said two Kurdish fighters had been wounded during the attack.

The Syrian Observatory for Human Rights monitoring group counted at least five US-led strikes against IS targets yesteday.

Turkey will let US and coalition forces use its bases for attacks against IS, according to American defence sources.

The sites, they said, included a key installation within 100 miles of the Syrian border, much closer than the jets have been flying on sorties launched from the Gulf.
