The High Street faces a new tidal wave of casino-style betting machines in bookmakers after a court kicked out a vital test case yesterday.

The warning came after Newham Council - which already has 81 betting shops including 18 on a single street - tried to prevent gambling chain Paddy Power from opening yet another one.

But a judge sided with the chain, saying there was no evidence that the outlet would attract violence, underage gambling and street drinking - despite  powerful evidence that this is already happening in and around other betting shops.

The Judge has allowed Paddy Power to open another betting shop in Newham as there is no evidence that connects gambling and anti-social behaviour

Last night campaigners said the ruling would be a ‘red rag’ to other bookmakers who would take more and more councils to court and force their way on to high streets ‘up and down the country’.

They said it also proved that councils were ‘powerless’ to act on behalf of their residents to end the scourge of unfettered gambling.

Newham is one of the poorest boroughs in the country, and the East London-based council believes bookmakers are deliberately targeting it with the fixed-odds betting terminals, branded the ‘crack cocaine’ of gambling.

Each roulette-style machine allows the user to stake up to £100 a time on the spin of a virtual wheel every 20 seconds.

The profusion of betting shops on England’s high streets is blamed on Tony Blair’s controversial 2005 Gambling Act, which relaxed planning rules on the opening such outlets.

Last night Labour MP David Lammy, who has campaigned against the profusion of the casino machines, reacted with horror to the ruling.

‘This court case proves that councils are utterly powerless to stop themselves being overrun by betting shops, and all because of our laissez-faire approach to planning,’ he said.

Newham Council already has 81 betting shops including 18 on a single street and tried to prevent gambling chain Paddy Power from opening yet another one

‘This was a high-profile case being watched very closely and I have no doubt now that this will be a red rag to bookmakers to go for it, and take the opportunity to move into high streets up and down the country in even bigger numbers.

‘The world will look with bemusement that Britain could allow an Olympic borough to become a mini Las Vegas.’ 

Councillors in Newham had voted to block Paddy Power from opening a new shop at the site of a former kebab shop claiming it would attract anti-social behaviour and underage drinking.

It also claimed to have evidence suggesting the primary use of the shop was for FOBTs and not traditional betting. However at an appeal against the decision at Thames Magistrates Court, district judge Paul Goldspring rejected claims that the shop would attract violence.

He claimed the local authority did not have the power to turn down the application and ordered them to pay £33,900 costs.

That meant the case would not be a landmark ruling that could halt the tide of betting shops opening to house FOBTs across the country. 

His decision yesterday came down to whether betting shops and FOBTs caused violent crime. Judge Goldspring said: ‘I find it significant the police did not object to the licence and agreed conditions.‘One would have thought, that if the concerns of the local authority were evidenced and well founded, the police would have said so then and at this appeal.’ 

David Lammy said that it was a travesty that the courts might force local authorities to use tax payer's money to fight gambling companies in court

Former Treasury minister Stephen Timms, the local MP for East Ham, had told the court the FOBTs ‘destroy people lives’ and the machines cause users to get angry when they lose and that violence can spill out into the high street.

But the judge said his evidence was of ‘very little help’.

He said: ‘While undoubtedly as MP he receives complaints about betting premises, 50 in three years of a constituency of 95,000 hardly proves his assertion.’ 

Speaking after the hearing, Councillor Ian Corbet from Newham said the decision underlined how little power local councils have in halting the increasing tide of betting shops.

He said: ‘We have a major problem with these machines. I do agree with people who call them the crack cocaine of gambling. We will soon have the most betting shops in London, outside Westminster.

‘But this is not just a problem for us, it is a problem for the whole nation. We are not unique we are just at the extreme end of the scale.’ 

Mr Corbet rejected criticism by the judge for ignoring advice from the planning inspector to continue to contest the appeal. He said: ‘I don’t regret it at all. The only thing I regret is that we did not win.’ 

Anti FOBT campaigner Derek Webb, founder of the Campaign for Fairer Gambling, said the decision highlighted the weakness of the Gambling Commission.

He said: ‘The Gambling Commission refused to support the Newham Council and is failing to uphold the licensing objectives of the 2005 Gambling Act, so is clearly unfit for purpose.’ 

Mr Lammy said: ‘It is a travesty that we are allowing Paddy Power to use their corporate might and forcing a local authority like Newham, which represents some of the poorest people in London, to use taxpayers’ money to fight them in court.

‘Because Paddy Power can afford expensive lawyers they have been successful.’ 

He added: ‘No one is against gambling, but these fixed-odds betting terminals are a menace and we now have a situation where boroughs like this have more betting shops than book shops.

The MP for Tottenham admitted Labour had got it wrong when it relaxed gambling laws eight years ago.

'I am very clear that the Gambling Act 2005 was flawed, because it let these betting shops through the back door to saturate our high streets,’ he said. ‘Labour have accepted it was wrong but in the meantime the coalition need to act. We need to give local authorities the legal power to say: enough is enough.’ 

A spokeswoman for Paddy Power said: ‘Paddy Power is pleased that the judge has upheld our appeal and granted the licence.

‘We want to fund initiatives that support the local community, particularly around up-skilling, getting people into - and back into - work and social enterprise.

‘We would like to set up a meeting to discuss this with Newham Council and the local MP, Stephen Timms, to enable us to put the money to work as soon as possible.’
