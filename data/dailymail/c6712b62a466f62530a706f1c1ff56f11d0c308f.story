A Chicago man who served 32 years in 
prison before being declared innocent in the 1980 rape and murder of a 
3-year-old girl is now facing a new murder charge.

DNA evidence prompted the 2012 release of Andre Davis and an innocence declaration in the death of Brianna Stickle of Rantoul.

Davis was charged Thursday in the 2013 death of Jamal Harmon.

Chicago man Andre Davis, who served 32 years in prison before being declared innocent in the 1980 rape and murder of a 3-year-old girl, is now facing a new murder charge

The 53-year-old Davis is jailed without bond.

NBC Chicago reports that roughly 15 months after Davis' release, Harmon was attending a party hosted by Davis' nephew at about 3 a.m.

Prosecutors say the 19-year-old Harmon got into a dispute with Davis'
 nephew over money lost in a dice game.

Assistant State's Attorney 
Robert Mack said the nephew shot and wounded Harmon, and Davis later cut
 the man's throat and dumped his body in an alley.

A witness later told police Harmon had made sounds after being shot, letting them know he was still alive.

The unnamed witness and Davis then carried Harmon's body to the trunk of a Cadillac, and Davis drove off telling people he was going to find a place to dump the corpse.

The body was found later that day in an alley.

Authorities say Harmon suffered three gunshot wounds to the face, lower neck, and left armpit. He had also been stabbed four times.

Davis told one witness he cut Harmon's throat, according to prosecutors.

In addition to the 1980 case, Davis has faced attempted murder, aggravated battery and weapons charges.
