A close friend of Jodi Arias testified at her murder trial today that the woman she knew could not have committed such a brutal murder as the prosecution displayed graphic sexual photos of the suspect in an effort to debunk the witness's portrayal.

Leslie Udy was called by the prosecution on Thursday in the trial of 32-year-old Arias who is facing the death penalty over the stabbing and shooting death of her on-off boyfriend Travis Alexander.

The state called Mrs Udy to discuss the time she spent with Arias on June 5, 2008 - a day after Alexander was killed at his home in Mesa, Arizona.

Disbelief: Leslie Udy, a close friend of Arias, told the Phoenix court that she couldn't imagine a woman she knew to be gentle and softly-spoken committing such a crime

Mrs Udy testified that Arias admitted to her that she had looked through Alexander's cellphone as they chatted in her car before going to dinner at Chili's restaurant with a group of friends.

The state witness told the jury that her husband had asked Arias about injuries to her hands and that Arias told him she had broken a glass at work and cut her fingers.

On June 9, Udy said that Arias had called her sobbing to say that Travis had been murdered and that 'she couldn't imagine how someone could do that to him'.

Mrs Udy said that Arias then called her at 2am the next night in despair at losing Alexander whom she described as her 'best friend'. Udy added that she had spoken to Arias on many occasions about her ex-boyfriend's death.

Arias, looked on in the Phoenix court today, breaking down in tears
as her friend appeared on the stand.

The murder suspect, who was dressed in a green shirt and wearing new glasses, wiped her nose and eyes with a tissue and let her hair fall over her 
face.

Mrs Udy said: 'The Jodi I knew was a very quiet, soft-spoken and gentle person. The person that I knew I couldn't imagine 
they could do something like that.'

The
prosecution then showed Mrs Udy photographs of Arias posing in sexually
explicit positions and asked if she knew about the images, to which the
witness replied 'no'.

Another image which appears to show Arias' foot alongside Alexander's bleeding body was also shown to Udy on the stand.

The prosecution rested its case today. The jury was dismissed until the trial resumes on January 29 when the defense will present their case.

On Wednesday, jurors had watched
a videotaped interrogation of Arias during which she insisted she
didn't kill him - but says if she had, she would have killed him 
quickly and humanely.

If found guilty of murder, Arias would become just the fourth woman on Arizona's death row.

She
allegedly stabbed and slashed Alexander nearly 30 times, slitting his 
throat from ear to ear, and shot him in the head around June 4, 2008, at
his Mesa home. His body was found five days later in his shower by 
roommates.

She first told police she knew nothing of the killing. Later she changed her story and said two intruders burst into the home and killed him while she managed to escape.

She now admits to the killing but claims she had to defend herself against an enraged and abusive Alexander.

Jurors on Wednesday watched a 
videotaped interrogation of Arias after her arrest. A detective grilled 
Arias, explaining that all the evidence points to her. She insisted she 
did not kill him.

Mesa police detective Esteban Flores continued to press her on the tape.

‘You shot him in the head, then you got a knife and you stabbed him,’ Flores said. ‘Jodi, tell me the truth, please.’

‘I did not kill Travis,’ Arias replied. However, she said if she were to have killed him, she couldn't have stabbed him. It would have been too cruel.

‘I don't think I could stab him. I think I would have to shoot him until he was dead if that were my intentions,’ Arias told the detective. ‘But I would have to wear gloves.

‘If I had it in me to kill him, the least I could have done was make it as humane as possible,’ she added.

Jurors in the murder trial asked questions suggesting they had doubts about the
investigation into the murder of Alexander, ABC News reported.

The jury submitted several handwritten questions to Judge Sherry 
Stephens after the testimony of Detective Esteban Flores of the Mesa, 
Arizona, police department. Some read:

'When interviewing Mr. Alexander's roommates, did they ever show concern for his extended absence?'

'Did you ever check into their alibis?'

Authorities
say Alexander was shot in the head with a .25-caliber handgun, the same
caliber gun Arias and her grandparents reported stolen from their 
Northern California home about a week before the killing. Arias was 
staying with them at the time.

Bloodied: Investigators described the 2008 crime scene as among the most gruesome they'd ever seen

Authorities
say they found sexual photographs in a camera inside Alexander's home 
that place Arias there on the day he was killed.

The photos, displayed for jurors this week during her trial in Phoenix, show Arias nude in Alexander's home, Alexander alive in the shower, then his dead body in the bathroom.

Police say the photos are time-stamped on the day he was killed. Detectives say Arias' bloody palm print and hair also were found at the scene.

None of the weapons used in the killing has been recovered.

Prosecutors say Arias came prepared to kill the 30-year-old devout Mormon, businessman and motivational speaker, and neglected to call police after leaving behind a crime scene that investigators described as among the most gruesome they'd ever seen.

They say she attacked him in a jealous rage after he broke up with her. She says she broke up with him after about five months of dating, but the two continued to see each other sexually.

Arias' attorney, Jennifer Willmott, told jurors in opening statements that Alexander ‘lunged at Jodi in anger’ on the day he was killed, and she had to defend herself.
