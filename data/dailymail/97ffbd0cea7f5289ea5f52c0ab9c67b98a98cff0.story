Australia's Matthew Glaetzer set a new Commonwealth Games men's sprint record as the mark was lowered five times in qualifying at the Sir Chris Hoy Velodrome.

Glaetzer, 21, topped the timesheets with 9.779 seconds, while compatriot Peter Lewis and New Zealand trio Ed Dawkins, Sam Webster and Matthew Archibald all bettered Shane Perkins' previous mark of 10.058secs, set in Delhi four years ago.

The Australasian quintet made it a tough session for the home nations riders as Team England's triple Olympic champion Jason Kenny was pushed into 11th place in 10.206s.

Unlucky: England's Kenny could not beat New Zealand's Webster but settled for Games silver

Nearly: Kenny got a 'funny feeling' and a 'bit of cramp' during the race at the Sir Chris Hoy Velodrome

Smashed: Matthew Glaetzer qualified quickest with a Games record, which was broken many times on the day

With only 12 of the 28 riders automatically qualfiying, it was a close run thing for Kenny, who will be joined in the next stage by Wales' Lewis Oliva, Scotland's Callum Skinner (10th) and team-mate Matt Cramptpon, who edged the final qualifying spot by 0.044s.

Scottish pair John Paul and Chris Pritchard ranked 14th and 18th respectively.
