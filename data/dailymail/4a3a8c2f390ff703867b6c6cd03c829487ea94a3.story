She's the ex-wife of convicted murderer and drug trafficker Carl Williams, who served her own six-month jail term for  trafficking $100,000 worth of ecstasy in 2004.

But Roberta Williams has revealed that being the mother of an autistic child is the 'toughest role' she has ever played in her life.

Her three-year-old son, Giuseppe, was diagnosed with autism at two years of age after a difficult pregnancy and birth.

'I was distraught. I just sat in the car and cried,' Ms Williams told A Current Affair of the day she found out about her fifth child's condition, describing it as a 'kick in the guts'. 

Roberta Williams, the ex-wife of convicted underworld murder Carl Williams, said being the mother of a child with autism has been the toughest role of her life 

Her three-year-old son Giuseppe was diagnosed with autism at the age of two

'Then [the doctor] told us that he will never function like a normal child, he will never talk,' she continued.

'To hear that was like someone took my breath away.'

Ms Williams revealed that it was just before the diagnosis that her life was rocked by the deaths of her former husband Carl, her sister, her niece, her mother and even Carl's mother.

'And I just thought, "is this going to be another death?",' she said of her son.

'I just couldn't take it in. It was just too much to take in.'

Ms Williams said that her mother's intuition had told her something was wrong throughout the pregnancy

'[The doctor] told us that he will never function like a normal child he will never talk. To hear that was like someone took my breath away,' Mrs Williams said

The mother shared an insight into her daily struggles with A Current Affair, as well as some of her parenting techniques when it came to raising Giuseppe.

'If you're not going to win the fight, don't start it,' Ms Williams said, describing the necessity to be consistent when disciplining her son.

The mother-of-five, who said she strongly opposed smacking children, shared a technique that had helped her adjust some of Giuseppe's behaviour. 

'He used to stim all day. He would just jump up and down and flap his arms in front of the TV,' Ms Williams told Channel Nine. 

The mother-of-five shared some of her parenting techniques when it came to raising Giuseppe, including her mantra 'If you're not going to win the fight, don't start it'

'So I went up and grabbed his hands, put them beside him and said no, and I made him look me in the eye and firmly said no.

'After a couple of weeks he stopped doing that, no more stimming. If I can help one parent out of this then that is good for me.' 

Despite the daily struggle, Ms William's said she 'would not change him for the world'.

'My little navigator is the bestest, cutest, happiest little dude you have ever come across.'

Ms Williams has four otherchildren, Tye, 25, Danielle, 20 and Breanane, 18, from a previous relationship and Dhakota, 11, from her marriage with Carl.

She says she conceived Giuseppe with fiance Robert Carpenter in 2011, the day before her ex-husband  was bludgeoned to death inside Victoria's Barwon Prison.
