The BBC were officially warned following an investigation in 1972 that 
young girls in the Top of the Pops audience were at risk

An inquiry officially warned the BBC more than 40 years ago that girls in the Top of the Pops audience were being put at risk, it has been revealed.

Sexual misconduct was investigated, following concerns, in 1972 by a leading QC who discovered what was described as 'immorality' at the programme.

A 64-page report was then handed to the director general and chairman at the time in which Sir Brian Neill QC raised concerns.

The conclusions of the report have been made public after four decades following a Freedom of Information Act request by The Telegraph.

The paper reports that in the heavily redacted report, Sir Brian concludes: 'A programme such as Top of the Pops does... present certain problems in that it introduces into the labyrinthine TV Centre a substantial number of teenage girls.'

He also urged the corporation to issue 'clear guidance as to who is to be ultimately responsible for the behaviour and control of audiences of this kind'.

The inquiry was commissioned following stories about sex scandals at the BBC and the suicide of 15-year-old Top of the Pops dancer Claire, also known as Samantha, McAlpine, the paper has reported.

In her diary, which was found near her body, the teenager had named a string of radio disc jockeys - and other showbusiness personalities - who, she claimed, had 'used' her.

Her brother-in-law Mark Ufland said Jimmy Savile was among those named in the diary 'for having some sort of sexual relationship with her'.

Police decided she was a fantasist after investigating her death.

Following his investigation, Sir Brian concluded 'isolated instances of immorality may have occurred'.

According to The Telegraph, senior figures including Sir Bill Cotton, head of light entertainment at the BBC, persuaded Sir Brian that any problems were rare.

The Metropolitan Police has been passed a copy of the report as it investigates historical sexual offences by Savile and others.

A BBC spokesperson said: 'In 1971, allegations of corrupt practices at the BBC were made by a newspaper.

'The BBC took these allegations extremely seriously and commissioned Brian Neill QC to prepare an independent report to establish what had happened.

The inquiry was commissioned following stories about sex scandals at the BBC more than 40 years ago

'Neill noted that the evidence 
available to him "fell a very long way short" of justifying the 
allegation of widespread corruption that had been made, though he also 
noted that despite his best efforts he was not able to access all the 
material that was held by the newspaper.

'In spite of this Neill did make recommendations for changes at the BBC which were duly responded to by the Corporation.

'The BBC introduced clearer guidance 
on the supervision of audiences and guests at Television Centre and 
maintaining stricter control of visitors to the BBC club.

'None of the allegations of misconduct referred to Jimmy Savile.'

Last month, MailOnline reported that 
sexual allegations about 81 BBC staff have been reported since the Jimmy
Savile scandal came to light - with almost half still working for the 
corporation.

Figures revealed that 40 of the people whose names have come up since October 3 are either current staff or contributors to the organisation.

The remainder have either died or no longer work for the BBC.

Data released as a result of a Freedom Of Information request shows that just ten of the cases involving present staff or contributors are still ongoing with investigations by the police or the BBC

Of the 81 people about whom allegations have been made, 54 are physical with 23 still involved with the corporation.

The remainder relate to verbal and 'non-physical' incidents.

In all there have been 152 sexual allegations made about BBC staff and contributors, with 52 of those still involved with the organisation.

The Savile scandal erupted last year and sent the BBC into crisis over its handling of the issue.

Director general George Entwistle resigned as a result of the fall-out only 54 days into the job.
