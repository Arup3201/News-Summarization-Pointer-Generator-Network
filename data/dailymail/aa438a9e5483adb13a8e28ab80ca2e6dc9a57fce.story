A hospital visitor was paid nearly £16,000 after slipping on a sachet of ­mayonnaise, it was revealed today.

The case was just one of the ­compensation claims that has cost Aintree University Hospital in ­Liverpool £2.5million in the last two years.

Among the other payments were £5,000 to a visitor who walked into the revolving entrance doors and £19,000 to a healthcare assistant who was hurt dismantling a commode.

The hospital also paid out £2,970 to a caterer who was hurt by a falling dishwasher door, £5,900 to a visitor injured by the ­hospital's lift doors and £11,710 to a worker who received an electric shock while plugging in a piece of equipment.

One visitor was awarded £10,200 and another £6,500 after they were struck by the car park barrier as they walked under it.

A third visitor got £11,500 after falling over a ­concrete post in the hospital grounds.

A cleaner was paid £8,300 after a fire extinguisher fell off the wall and a member of security staff whose chair collapsed underneath him was handed £6,500.

Jonathan Isaby, chief executive of the TaxPayers' Alliance, told MailOnline: 'It's absurd that taxpayers have forked out for this ludicrous compensation claim.

'A claim culture is undermining the heath budget and this condiment slip is a perfect example of a cynical attempt to cash in at taxpayers' expense.'

A spokesman for Aintree University Hospital told the Daily Star Sunday: 'To set some context, these payments span two years during which more than two million patients and ­visitors attended our hospital.

'They're not everyday occurrences. The payments during this period represent 0.4 per cent of our budget.

'We also reclaim a proportion of these payments from the NHS insurance scheme, which further lessens the impact financially.

'We defend civil claims if appropriate but we will also settle if it's appropriate. We always try to make our site safer.'
