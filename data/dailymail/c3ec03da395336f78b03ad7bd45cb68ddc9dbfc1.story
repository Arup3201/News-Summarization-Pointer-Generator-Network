The 'spygate' scandal at Cardiff City has taken a new twist, with the club denying reports that they have requested the Premier League overturn their 3-0 defeat against Crystal Palace earlier this month.  

The BBC claim to have seen a five-page letter from Cardiff, in which they allegedly say the result should not stand after allegedly unearthing evidence that Palace director of football Iain Moody contacted club employees to find out team information.  

But a well-placed Cardiff source insisted to Sportsmail that their formal complaint did not make such a request.

The source instead claims Cardiff have requested an investigation into the saga, as revealed by Sportsmail on Monday.  

The
 source said: 'The club is not asking for the result to be changed – 
that would sound like sour grapes. We ask that the Premier League look 
into the situation.'

The Premier has confirmed it is looking into the matter to ascertain what rules may have been breached.

It is understood that Cardiff are claiming the incident goes against the Premier League's rules on 'good faith'.

Rule
 B15 states: 'In all matters and transactions relating to the league 
each club shall behave towards each other club and the league with the 
utmost good faith.'   

Cardiff's
 allegations are understood to claim Moody, who was sacked by the club 
last year, contacted at least three members of their staff ahead of 
their fixture earlier this month.

Moody has previously denied the allegations.    

A
 prominent Cardiff source claims manager Ole Gunnar Solskjaer was made 
aware of what was allegedly going on when a message sent from Moody's 
phone was received by a third party, listing the starting 11 that 
Solskjaer ultimately fielded against Palace.  

The recipient tipped off Solskjaer, who alerted the club's hierarchy, but the Norwegian opted against changing his team.  

An independent commission may be asked to rule on Cardiff's complaint.  

League
 chiefs will decide whether the complaint should be taken forward - it 
is understood there remains uncertainty about whether any regulation 
would have been breached even if the allegation was proven.  

If
 the complaint is taken forward it could be dealt with by either the 
Premier League's board or more likely an independent commission.  

There is no time frame for the investigation though the Premier League is taking the matter seriously.
