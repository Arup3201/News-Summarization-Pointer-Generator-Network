She sat on a covered dais alongside her husband, who was wearing his military medals from his time serving in the Royal Navy, as the the Last Post and national anthem were played.

Later she was taken out of the rain and into the hospital's chapel to be presented with a book listing volunteer military reservists and supporting auxiliaries from Greater London from 1908 to 2014.

Emma Bass, a civil servant who worked on the book, called Stepping Forward, shared a laugh about the weather with the Queen.

The 24-year-old, from Fulham in west London, said: 'She was really friendly and said she liked our hats.

'Her hands were wet from the rain and she said it was a bit of a shame, but she really liked the book and we spoke about it being a continuous process to find out more information. She was really lovely, kind and amazing.'

After the march the couple met with civil servant Emma Bass, 24, who has written a book paying tribute to reservists from Greater London from 1908 to 2014

The Royal Hospital Chelsea is the home of the famous Chelsea pensioners, retirees who have served as regular soldiers in the armed forces

The ceremony was led by Richard Chartes, the Bishop of London, and included a march by reservists accompanied by the Honourable Artillery Company band.

It is held on the centenary of the shooting of Archduke Franz Ferdinand in Sarajevo on June 28 1914. The killing is widely viewed as setting off a chain of events that caused the First World War.

After the service, the Queen was presented with Stepping Forward, a tribute to volunteer military reservists and supporting auxiliaries from Greater London from 1908 to 2014.

Lieutenant Governor of the Royal Hospital Chelsea Major General Peter Currie said: 'We are honoured and delighted to hold this service in the grounds of the Royal Hospital Chelsea.

'There is no more fitting site for this event in London than the home of the Chelsea Pensioners which for over 300 years has stood as a symbol of the nation's gratitude.'
