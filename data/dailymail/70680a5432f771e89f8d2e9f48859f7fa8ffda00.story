A women with cancer who refused to terminate her unborn child for the sake of her own health is finally enjoying life with a healthy little girl and has battled the disease.

Lyndsey Crowder was delighted when she fell pregnant again after previously losing three babies but weeks later she was diagnosed Hodgkin’s Lymphoma and was told by doctors she possibly had just weeks to live.

Doctors gave her three options including terminating her baby for the sake of her own health or taking a huge risk and starting life-saving treatment.

Remarkable: Lyndsey Crowder was delighted when she gave birth to Sidney Rose by c-section at 34 weeks despite battling a tumour the size of a football in her chest and having to endure eight rounds of chemotherapy

Mrs Crowder, a 34-year-old dispatcher for the North West Ambulance service and who lives in Walton, Merseyside, said: 'To my mind there was no choice. But I knew I had to give the baby a chance.'

The doctors explained it was unclear 
what effect chemotherapy could have on her unborn child or how 
significant a strain a pregnancy could be on her already weakened body.

With a tumour the size of a small football in her chest Mrs Crowder began eight rounds of gruelling chemotherapy.

She said: 'I had scan after scan to check on the
baby and even though everything looked fine it wasn’t until she was 
born and I saw her that I could believe she’d be okay'.

Remarkably Sidney Rose, now four, was safely delivered by c-section at 34 weeks.

Her arrival was made even more special as Mrs Crowder and her husband Nick endured two tragedies trying to become parents. Their first daughter Alice, was stillborn, and then Mrs Crowder miscarried twins.

Sidney Rose was finally conceived with the help of fertility drug Chlomid and she fell pregnant at the end of 2007.

Mrs Crowder lost three babies before she fell pregnant with Sidney (pictured now) but noticed that she was feeling unwell. Doctors diagnosed her with Hodgkin's Lymphoma and she thought she was going to die

However, she said she had begun to notice that she was feeling unwell.

She said: 'In hindsight I hadn’t been well since my birthday in 
August with chest infections and coughs and itchy skin.

'By the time I was pregnant it was worse. I looked terrible and felt terrible. I was sick of being sick. I am a trained nurse and it did go through my mind that something else was going on with my body.'

She was admitted to Aintree Hospital and underwent a battery of tests before the news about the Hodgkin’s Lymphoma, cancer of the lymphatic system, was confirmed.

Mrs Crowder said: 'I thought, I can deal with the cancer
but I cannot lose another baby. I just knew I would do whatever it took
to get that child into the world. The rest was in God’s hands.'

She added: 'When she arrived she had more hair 
than me and was perfect. After nine months of fighting for her it was 
amazing to hear her cry. I just lay there and thought, ‘my work is 
done’'.

But the delivery took its toll. Having
lost a lot of blood Mrs Crowder underwent an emergency full body scan which
discovered the cancer had travelled around her body and she 
subsequently underwent more rounds of intensive chemotherapy.

She also had a bone marrow transplant at the Royal Liverpool Hospital.

'That was when I felt truly scared. I 
remember looking out at the hospital car park from my isolation room and
thinking: is this the last thing I’ll see before I die?’'

But the treatment - she also underwent radiotherapy - was successful and she has been in remission for 30 months.

Meanwhile, her daughter has grown and continues to be a source of hope and pride.

She said: 'At times it feels as if it’s happened to someone else and I have to pinch myself to remember it’s all been real.

'But if one person reads this and it gives them hope, whether they’re fighting cancer or trying to have children, then I have done my job.'
