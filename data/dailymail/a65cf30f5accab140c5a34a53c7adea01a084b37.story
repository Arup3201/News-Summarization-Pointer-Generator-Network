The beautiful game has become even more enticing - after a Spanish football team produced its own zombie porn film.

La Liga's Getafe has struggled in recent years to fill its 17,000 seater Madrid stadium, with one of the lowest attendance records in the division.

And so bosses have come up with a novel plan to populate their Coliseum Alfonso Pérez - by encouraging fans to watch a club-produced erotic movie whilst at sperm donation clinics.

Enticing: These zombies star in a film which is trying to boost the fan base of Madrid football club Getafe

They hope their passion will transfer to produce a plethora of supporters which will prop up the club for years to come.

'We are few and we have to be more. We have to move a mass of fans to seed the world with Getafe supporters,' said the film's creator Angel Torres.

But rather than being a seedy sideline for the football club, Zombies Calientes del Getafe (Hot Zombies of Getafe) is in fact part of a new publicity campaign to try and boost its fan base.

The advert, which has appeared on Spanish national television, tells the story of a Getafe sperm donor who, when he gets to the clinic, is given the filthy film.

At the start of the film, this Getafe supporter is seen looking around the Madrid club's empty stadium

'This shows us a problem: We are few' - says the video trying to get more supporters for Getafe

'The solution is simple,' the narrator says.

'It's within you. We talk about donating sperm. The more donors, the better.

'To make sure we get the best supporter, we have made the first Getafe porn movie.'

It cuts to half-naked zombies rolling around on beds who say how important it is to get Getafe back on track.

The footage then goes back to the donor who, with a steely determination, marches down a corridor with fellow fans, into an individual cubicle, to complete his mission.

The solution is simple: Getafe says it has 'made' its own erotic movie to make sure donors produce supporters

Struggling: Getafe have found it difficult to fill its Coliseum Alfonso Perez in recent years

Club marketing director José Antonio Cuétara told radio show Pasión Franja: 'We are a small city surrounded by a great capital of the world, and so we face an extraordinary crisis.'

Club / Capacity / Season holders

Barcelona - 110,000 - 75,000

Real Madrid  - 81,178 - 68,670

Atletico Madrid - 54,851 - 47,000

Getafe - 17,000 - 9,000

He said the controversial advert had received a 'largely positive' response and that season ticket sales had soared to 9,000 since its broadcast.

Creator Angel Torres added: 'We wanted to relay reality, because we all come to the stadium when we can, and it's true that there are many season ticket holders but it's never full.'

It is not the first time Getafe have resorted to viral marketing in a bid to boost its fan base.

In 2009 Burger King's new sponsorship deal with the side saw the  chain's logo splashed on the front of their shirts and a picture of the 'Burger King' on the inside, too.

It meant goalscorers could wear a mask during elaborate celebrations - Ravanelli-style.

Getafe's stadium is the third largest in the Spanish capital. Real Madrid's Santiago Bernabeu holds 80,000, and rivals Atletico's Vicente Calerón has room for 55,000.
