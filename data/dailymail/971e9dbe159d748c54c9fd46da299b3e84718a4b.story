The show, which features 'stars' such as Black Dee, has given Channel 4 its highest ratings for two years with 5.3million watching last night

Benefits Street has become the most viewed programme on Channel 4 in almost two years, drawing an audience of 5.2million for its latest offering.

The series, which follows the lives of people on James Turner Street - where 90 per cent of residents are on benefits - saw off competitionfrom ITV's The Bletchley Circle and BBC 1 drama New Tricks.

Last night’s programme, the third episode of the series which explored the 'stars' relationships with their children, drew in a record 21.5 per cent of all TV viewers.

The figures, combined from Channel 4, Channel 4 HD and Channel 4 plus one, beat last week by 100,000 viewers.

The programme has courted controversy from the start, with the inhabitants of James Turner Street in Birmingham saying that the producers 'did anything they could' to get the most shocking footage.

Although the people who appear on the programme were not paid for their appearance - which could affect their ability to claim benefits - they claim producers used gifts instead to assure their co-operation.

Becky Howe, 23, features in the show alongside her partner Mark Thomas,
 also 23, and their children Casey, two, and Callum, four.

She says that residents were given energy drinks, cigarettes and fast food in order to take part, and that alcoholic 'Fungi' was allegedly given cans of beer for participating.

While the figures are impressive, they fall short of the Paralympic ceremony, watched by 7.7million and are far cry from the heyday of Channel 4 viewing, when in 2004 Friends, the finale, drew an audience
 of 9.6million, and in 2002 when the Big Brother season three final saw 10million people tune in.

Channel 4's last big hit, My Big Fat Gypsy Wedding, also drew larger numbers with 9.7million people watching the show in February 2011.

A Channel 4 spokesperson said: 'Part of Channel 4’s remit is to stimulate debate and Benefits Street has done this on a national scale, evidenced by the large audiences tuning into the programme as well as the high volume of media coverage and social media comments.'

In the latest allegations against the show, it was reported at the weekend that the children of some of the 'stars' are being abused and bullied at school.

Last night's episode focused on the children of Benefits Street - such as White Dee's son Gerrard

Confessions: Mark Thomas and Becky Howe confessed to benefit fraud on the show

Desmond Jaddoo, part of the Birmingham Empowerment Forum, said that even adults have been pulling up outside the playground to shout abuse at children as they play outside.

The realities of life on the notorious Birmingham road - where ninety per cent of residents receive state hand-outs and petty crime and drugs use are rife - caused a national outcry after the first episode was aired this month.

Viewers were shocked at scenes in which residents confessed to fiddling their benefits, a serial theif was followed around on a shoplifting spree and an alcoholic tried to make some easy cash by gathering up free magazines and trying to sell them as copies of the Big Issue.

Mr Jaddoo said that the problem was worst at the Oasis Foundry Academy, which is on James Turner Street, but that it applied to schools around the area.

The controversial fly-on-the-wall documentary series focusing on the lives of residents living on James Turner Street, in Birmingham has divided the nation since it began on January 6

He told MailOnline: 'People are driving down the street hurling abuse.

'There is stigmatisation of the children at the local school. And indeed other children at other schools have been bullied - at secondary schools too.

'No matter how sympathetic teaching staff will be, children are now going to school with that stigma attached to him. They will be the true victims of all of this.'
