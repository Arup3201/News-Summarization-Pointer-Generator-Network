They were given the best Christmas present ever when they welcomed their son into the world last week.

So it's no wonder Claire Danes and Hugh Dancy looked happier than ever as they took newborn Cyrus Michael Christopher Dancy on an afternoon stroll in New York.

The pair looked exhausted but over the moon on the outing, with British actor Hugh taking charge of pushing the little boy in his buggy.

Wrapped up: The two actors shielded themselves from the cold weather in wintery outfits as they took their son, who is less than a week old, out in Manhattan

Both Claire and Hugh wrapped up warm in chilly Manhattan, with Homeland star Claire keeping her post-baby body hidden beneath an olive green padded coat.

She finished off her outfit with a grey hat and scarf, while Hugh opted for a checked scarf to match his khaki jacket.

The pair were joined by Mamie Gummer, the actress daughter of Meryl Streep and a close friend of the couple's.

It is quite fitting that Mamie, who also lives in Manhattan, was one of the first friends to be seen publicly with new baby Cyrus as she was also there when Claire and Hugh met.

The three actors all starred in the film Evening, where Hugh played Mamie's younger brother who had an undying love for Claire's character.

A representative for Claire confirmed the 33-year-old actress had given birth to Cyrus last Monday.

And Claire told People.com that she and her husband are looking forward to 'getting to know our new Dancy' during the holidays.

Claire recently told Anderson Cooper that she and Hugh were ecstatic to be expecting three years after their nuptials.

'There's no way of anticipating what that's going to mean for us but we are very excited,' she said. 'We are going to love this person, I know that.'

The actress has plenty to celebrate going into the New Year. In addition to the baby, her Showtime drama Homeland is leading the way with four Golden Globe nominations, including a nod to Danes in the best actress category.

Danes plays Carrie Mathison, a driven CIA officer who falls for a war hero suspected of being a terrorist.

She's expected to now have a little time off, having recently wrapped production of forthcoming comedy drama As Cool as I Am, co-starring James Marsden.

Dancy meanwhile will feature in animated family musical Dorothy of Oz next year, as the voice of Marshal Mallow.
