Teddy Sheringham has arrived at West Ham's training ground to begin his new role as the club's attacking coach ahead of next season.

The former Hammers striker was offered the job in May after owners David Gold and David Sullivan created a list of goals for manager Sam Allardyce to achieve following a disappointing season.

One of those targets is for the club to play more attractive, attacking football - something Sheringham will work on alongside the former Bolton and Newcastle boss.

The 48-year-old, who has joined on a 
part-time basis, scored 30 goals for the east London club during a 
two-year spell at Upton Park between 2001 and 2003.

He will work with strikers Andy Carroll and Carlton Cole - and any summer signings Allardyce makes - to try and ensure the club hit the back of the net more regularly next term.

The Hammers managed just 40 Premier League goals last season, the joint-sixth lowest total in the entire division.

Speaking after his appointment in May, the former England striker told whufc.com: 'I'm very excited. Sam (Allardyce) phoned me a week or so ago and asked me if I fancied it. It was far too good to resist really.

'Being a West Ham boy and coming from the area, it fits nicely in all that I'm about, what with working alongside Sam and knowing a few of the players as well.

'They've got a lot of respect for Sam, they speak very highly of him and to know that's the case made me want to get involved.

'Having played as a striker for years, Sam wants me to add something along those lines. Anything I can do to be of help, I'm very willing.

'I obviously know (Andy) Carroll, (Carlton) Cole and Kevin Nolan and I understand there'll be a few more forward players that I could be working with and alongside to help improve.'

West Ham begin their Premier League campaign at home to London rivals Tottenham.
