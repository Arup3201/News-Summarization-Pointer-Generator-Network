A Nazi war tank that police found in a drug dealer's back garden was sold on eBay for more than £5,000.

Officers came across the intimidating machine as they raided the property of David Barrett, 46, after he was jailed for his part in a huge heroin smuggling plot. 

Fortunately, the vehicle turned out only to be a replica of a German SDKFZ 222 'Helga' tank - which was used in reconnaissance missions during the Second World War.

Nottinghamshire Police seized the 2.25 ton  tank under the Proceeds of Crime Act and cashed in on their discovery by selling it on eBay for £5,205 in January. 

They also found other military memorabilia, £2,000 in cash and a luxury Breitling watch at Barrett's £200,000 home in picturesque Barton-in-Fabis.

The tank - complete with turret and fake cannon -was sold earlier this year but its origins only came to light after a meeting between Nottinghamshire Police and Crime Commissioner Paddy Tipping and other senior officers on Tuesday.

It emerged a confiscation order was 
granted to seize £110,000 worth of assets from Barrett in September 2011
after he was jailed for 13-years for conspiring to supply heroin and 
amphetamine.

Detective Inspector Andy Baguley, from Nottinghamshire Police, said: 'This is a reminder of how powerful the Proceeds of Crime Act can be.

'It can be used to strengthen investigations and ultimately claw back the money and property held by those intent on a life of crime.

'By definition, the offence of money laundering will almost certainly have occurred where a theft or drugs transaction has taken place.

'Considering an additional money laundering offence allows us to access a whole raft of financial material, which could either support the prosecution of the original offence or provide an opportunity for a standalone charge where the original offence cannot be proven.'

The eBay listing for the tank describes the vehicle as not being road legal, built on a 110 Land Rover chassis and with a turbo diesel engine. 

It adds: 'There is a single seat inside for the driver but there is a good amount of space inside for kit or additional soldiers. 

'Externally could do with a repaint or a good clean.

'Internally is very good.'

The Leichter Panzerspahwagen (Light Armoured Reconnaissance Vehicle) were produced in Nazi Germany from 1935 to 1944.

It was used by the reconnaissance battalions of the Panzer divisions and usually had a crew of three - including a gunner who manned a a 28 mm anti-tank cannon.
