The widow of an Alzheimer's sufferer who was shot dead in Georgia after he got lost and tried to enter a house in the early hours has spoken out about the tragic incident.

Deanne Westbrook's husband, Ronald, had managed to slip out of their home on November 27, and was shot when he tried to enter a house near where they used to live.

Mrs Westbrook, who was married for 51 years, is struggling to come to terms with the way her 72-year-old husband was shot under Georgia's Stand Your Ground laws.

'I can't imagine him feeling threatened by my husband, that's what surprises me,' Mrs Westbrook said. 

'I think he was so cold. He was looking 
for help when he was ringing that doorbell at their place. I think he 
just wanted somebody to help him.'

Her husband, a retired Lieutenant Colonel in the U.S. Air Force had taken to collecting other people's mail as part of his deterioration from Alzheimer's.

His night time ramblings led him to the porch of Joe Hendrix, 34, who had recently moved to the property and had already been spooked by strangers hammering on the door.

As Mr Hendrix's financee called 911 the 34-year-old confronted the stranger outside his house and, when Mr Westbrook walked towards the house without identifying himself, Mr Hendrix fired.

When police arrived Mr Westbrook was dead, with his beloved rottweiler standing guard over his body.

'He was Ron’s constant companion and he was loyal to the end,' Sheriff Wilson told Chattanooga Radio TV.

'I never would have thought he would've [come] to an end like this. I was prepared for the Alzheimer's to get 
worse and for me to take care of him here. And I was going to do it,' Mrs Westbrook said. 

'I understand the man who shot him is real upset, and I think he should be,' she added. 'He shot an innocent man. He should have stayed in the house like a normal person would.'

On November 19 a stranger appears at the  home Joe Hendrix's fiancee is renting at about midnight and begins demanding to speak to the previous tenant.

Frightened and home alone with two children, she calls Mr Hendrix and police but the man disappears before they arrive.

On November 27, Ronald Westbrook slips out of the house he shares with his wife of 51 years and goes for a walk with his dogs.

At about 2.20am police stop Mr Westbrook when they see him standing by the road holding mail. He tells them he lives nearby and they leave him alone.

At 4am Mr Hendrix and his fiancee are woken by the sound of someone ringing their doorbell and trying to get inside.

As his fiancee calls 911 Mr Hendrix takes his pistol and goes outside to confront the stranger.

When Mr Westbrook fails to respond when Mr Hendrix calls out to him, the 34-year-old fires, hitting the Alzheimer's sufferer in the chest.

No charges have been filed. Under Georgia's Stand Your Ground law homeowners are allowed to use lethal force if they feel threatened.

Sheriff Steve Wilson, who knew the victim, 
paid tribute to his friend who used to play trumpet in the church 
orchestra. He added that in recent years, although he appeared fit, he 
was struggling with the onset of Alzheimer's.

'Physically
he was in good shape, you would never know anything was wrong with 
him,' Sheriff Wilson said.  'But he had gotten to the point where he 
wouldn’t say much, he had trouble thinking of the right words to say. 
That may have been why he didn’t respond [to Mr Hendrix].'

Police are still deciding whether to press charges against Mr Hendrix. Under Georgia law residents are allowed to use lethal force to stop someone if they feel threatened.

Mr Hendrix had brought his pistol to the home his fiancee was renting after a stranger had knocked on their door at about midnight, demanding to speak to the old tenants.

His fiancee was home alone with two children at the time, and called Mr Hendrix in a panic. By the time the police and Mr Hendrix arrived at the house, the stranger had gone but the incident left them with frayed nerves.

About a week later, Mr Westbrook being ringing the doorbell and trying the handle at about 4am. When Mr Hendrix went outside and called out for him to identify himself, the 72-year-old didn't respond and began walking towards him.

According to Walker County Sheriff Wilson, when Mr Hendrix was told that his victim had Alzheimer's he broke down, the Sydney Morning Herald reported.

Mr Hendrix has not commented about the incident because of the on going investigation, but his attorney Lee Davis said he was distraught.

Family man: Ronald Westbrook was a much-loved husband, father and grandfather

'He is not a gun-toting rights activist 
who's saying, "Keep off my property". He's a man who 
thought he had to take action because of what he believed to be a real 
and imminent threat,' Mr Davis said.

Regardless of the law or next steps, Mrs Westbrook is now struggling to come to terms with her husband's death.

'I don't know enough about the law,' she told the Times Free Press. 'But that's all over now. His life is already taken. He took the life of a real gentle man, and it's a crying shame.'
