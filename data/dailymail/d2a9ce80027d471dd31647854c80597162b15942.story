Day tripper: Boston mob boss James 'Whitey' Bulger was a prisoner of Alcatraz from 1959 to 1963 as seen in this mugshot

There's brazen and there's brazen...and then there's James 'Whitey' Bulger.

During the epic 16 years he spent evading authorities, the Boston mob boss enjoyed a day out to Alcatraz... where he'd previously been a prisoner for four years.

Perhaps he just wanted to see how the San Francisco prison had changed. But for someone who didn't own a car and paid all his bills in cash to avoid detection, it was a pretty risky day trip.

Still, he and long term mob moll 
Teresa Stanley seemed to enjoy themselves, a source close to his family 
who has pictures of the great event, told the New York Post.

Bulger
even donned prison stripes outside 'The Rock' for a souvenir snap, 
while Stanley slipped into a jumpsuit stencilled with 'Property of 
Alcatraz.'

Bulger was locked up in the island prison from 1959 to 1963 on federal armed robbery charges.

The
source said the photo of the pair at the prison was definitely taken 
while Bulger was on the run, but was unsure of an exact date.

He
was reported to have been in San Francisco in the January of 1995, 
weeks before fleeing to Boston to escape indictment for murder and 
racketeering, according to The Boston Globe.

Scenic: Bulger was back at the prison in the 1990s, this time as a tourist. Even though he was on the run from the FBI he took time to dress up in jailbird garb and pose for souvenir photos

The law finally caught up with him last week when the now 81-year-old and his long-term girlfriend Catherine Greig were arrested in Santa Monica.

Bulger is charged with 19 murders, extortion, money laundering and other crimes; if convicted, he faces life in prison or the death penalty.

The FBI has long been criticised for not trying hard enough to find Bulger and the Alcatraz visit will only add fuel to that fire.

But he seemed to be the master of evasion adopting an unassuming lifestyle, limited his social contact
to small talk and adhered to the code of silence from the mob life he 
left behind.

On the inside: Bulger would have strolled down 'Broadway' in the main cellhouse in the prison, all the while being one of the FBI's most wanted

When federal agents tracked him to his lair last week, it 
was only after targeting the one part of his past that Bulger didn't 
leave behind -Â  his girlfriend Catherine.

By all 
accounts, the two did little to ever arouse suspicion, posing as two 
retirees holed up in a bland white 1970s apartment complex in Santa 
Monica amid other buildings of the same era.

Although Bulger was believed to have 
millions of dollars stashed in secret accounts, and investigators found 
$800,000 hidden in the apartment, the couple didn't live lavishly.

They 
paid $1,145 cash several days in advance each month for a 
rent-controlled unit, while newer neighbours paid more than twice as 
much. Greig shopped at a 99-cent store.

Occasionally, they splurged, even while remaining discreet.

Andrew
Turner, the general manager of Michael's, recognised pictures of the 
fugitives this week as the couple who dined occasionally at table No 23
at the upscale institution.

He had a record of them paying their $190 
tab in cash for a meal that included Grey Goose vodka cocktails, foie 
gras, steak and lobster, topped off by wine, in September 2009 - the 
month Bulger turned 80.

The couple kept to themselves and were 
unassuming, Turner recalled.

'This guy was just nice, mild and meek, milquetoast in a little apartment in Santa Monica,' said Bill Keefer, a 
retired U.S. marshal who supervised the witness protection program in 
Los Angeles, Hawaii and Long Island, New York.

'This guy should have been a 
supervisor with the marshal's witness protection programme. He did an 
outstanding job, the louse.'

Neighbours of the couple said they stuck close to home.

Greig was
the more outgoing of the two while Bulger was sometimes cranky and 
reclusive. Barbara Gluck, a tenant down the hall, described Greig as 
sweet and lovely, Bulger not so.

'It was like she was hanging on to a time-bomb,' Gluck said. 'At one point, she said, "he has a rage issue".'

Room 303: Neighbours said the couple were friendly but kept to themselves. One even said she would 'miss them'

Others said the couple went out of their way to ingratiate themselves while also maintaining a distance.

'They were good neighbours,' said Catalina Schlank, 88. 'I will miss them.'

Bulger's
wealth helped him maintain independence from family or former criminal 
allies who might have given away his location, said retired FBI agent 
Scott Bakken, who worked the Bulger case for a short time in 2002.

'Here you have somebody who is far more 
sophisticated than some 18-year-old who killed someone in a drive-by,' Bakken said.

'To be a successful fugitive you have to cut
all contacts from your previous life. He had the means and kept a low 
profile.'
