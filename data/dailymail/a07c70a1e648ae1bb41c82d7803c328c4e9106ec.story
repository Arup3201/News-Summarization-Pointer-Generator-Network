A Spanish priest has been arrested after allegedly performing at least 13 exorcisms on an anorexic girl after her parents told him she was 'possessed by the devil'.

Jesús Hernández Sahagún, the official exorcist of Valladolid, is facing charges of gender violence, causing injury and mistreatment, according to local media.

The rituals began in 2012 when the girl's parents contacted Sahagún for help after being convinced she had been possessed by the devil, reported El País.

In a statement to a court in Burgos, the girl's parents said Sahagún was aware their daughter was receiving medical treatment at the time, adding he had full access to her records.

They said the priest had assured them the exorcism would not interfere with her treatment, thelocal.es reported. 

The ceremonies, which involved her being tied up with crucifixed placed on her head, left the girl injured - and at one point, she tried to commit suicide. 

But in December last year, Sahagún told El Mundo newspaper defended the exorcisms, adding he had performed more than 200 in the past four years. 

The archbishop of Burgos also spoken out last year, insisting the suicide attempt was not a result of the exorcisms.

Pope Francis made exorcisms an official Catholic practice last year, hailing it as a 'form of charity'

He added exorcisms are 'a religious practice maintained as part of the Church's tradition, as a right available to all the faithful'.

Pope Francis made exorcisms an official Catholic practice in July last year.

The Vatican, who hailed exorcism as a 'form of charity' formally recognised the International Association of Exorcists, a group of 250 priests in 30 countries who liberate demons from the faithful.

In Spain, there are currently around 15 priests in with Church authorization to perform exorcisms.
