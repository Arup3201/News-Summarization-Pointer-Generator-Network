A pedestrian was hit by a truck during a live news broadcast about the safety of Louisville’s infamous Dixie highway.

The accident was caught on camera as Brittany Gonzalez, a reporter from Louisville’s WHAS11 News, did a report on Monday morning about a plan for $5 million worth of safety improvements on the highway known as Dixie die-way.

Half-way through the segment a man was struck by a red jeep as he crossed the notoriously dangerous corridor.

Struck: A pedestrian was hit by a jeep during a live news broadcast about the safety of Louisville's infamous Dixie highway

The man had been walking back and forth on the road when he was hit and WHAS’s camera caught the whole thing on tape.

The station reported: 'Gonzalez went to the man and kept him alert and awake until the EMS arrived on the scene. EMS treated and transported him to St. Mary's Hospital.

'The victim was talking to our photographer just minutes before the accident, saying he was going to catch the bus.

The station reported: 'Gonzalez went to the man and kept him alert and awake until the EMS arrived on the scene. EMS treated and transported him to St. Mary's Hospital'

The station said: ''The victim was talking to our photographer just minutes before the accident, saying he was going to catch the bus'

'He apparently just got out of the hospital and had fresh sutures.'

From 2002 to 2007, this stretch saw 350 accidents, 70 injuries and two fatalities, according to Whas11. 

And the number has increased recently - particularly pedestrian accidents.

In October, a woman was hit by a truck when she crossed in the middle of 9900 block of Dixie Highway.

In February a man was killed as he crossed Dixie at Watson Lane.
