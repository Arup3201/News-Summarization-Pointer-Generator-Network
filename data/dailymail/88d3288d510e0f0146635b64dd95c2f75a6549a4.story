When Kate wore that blue Issa dress for her engagement announcement in 2010, she sparked one of the first of many 'Kate Middleton fashion frenzies'. 

The £522 dress, a silk wrap design by Brazilian designer Daniella Helayel, was subsequently reproduced in the same sapphire shade and went on to sell out again and again on net-a-porter and in Harvey Nichols.

And now, the dress has been offered up to a whole new market - an entirely appropriate one too, given Kate's pregnancy - as maternity fashion website Blossom Mother
& Child unveils a version of Kate's engagement dress tailored 
especially for pregnant women.

Trendsetter: Kate chose to wear a blue Issa wrap dress on the event of her engagement announcement in 2010 - and the style was reissued and went on to sell thousands

Adaptable: Blossom Mother & Child is selling a maternity version of the Issa dress for £522 - and the dress has plenty of space to accommodate a growing bump

The wrap dress, retailing for £522 on blossommotherandchild.com, is an almost identical take on the original blue Issa dress, only the cut allows for a blossoming bump.

The dress sits alongside a number of similar sapphire blue dresses on Blossom, as well as other maternity fashion sites such as Babes With Babies and Peaks Of London, proving that the Duchess's fashion influence has touched the world of maternity style too.

The dress, a plunging V-necked style with soft wrap ties, is a classic Issa shape, emblematic of the brand's easy aesthetic.

Every season Daniella Helayel puts out new takes on this favourite shape and fans of the brand - which include both Kate and her sister Pippa - have an almost insatiable appetite for the style.

Whether a special maternity shape or not, Issa's dresses - maternity or otherwise - have long been worn by pregnant women - and are stretchy and comfortable enough to be worn right up to term.

The ties can be comfortably fixed above the bump, and the fabric is light and cool.

And the best part? Unlike traditional maternity clothes that cannot be worn once the baby arrives, an Issa dress will become a wardrobe classic.

That's £522 well spent.
