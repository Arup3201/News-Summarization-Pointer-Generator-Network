A Chinese school has solved its problem with a lack of space for a school sports day by using the emergency lane of a nearby motorway.

The Xingguo School, in Guiyang, Guizhou province, is a school that mainly has children from rural migrant workers in the city and therefore does not have a lot of resources.

It did have a small playground, but this ended up being built on, leaving the kids with nowhere to exercise until teachers came up with the bright idea of using part of the local motorway.

Risky: Running races at the school take place on the emergency lane of the motorway

There are about 500 students in the school, but without even a small playground the children need an alternative location. The local council could only tell them that there was nothing suitable where the children could enjoy running or any other form of exercise.

Headteacher Manchu Ni, 56, said: ‘We rarely organised sports which require a larger space than we have available. But we were then told that we faced closure if we did not do something as it’s the law that primary school students should have physical fitness test. There was nowhere else we could go.

‘We always stage events after rush-hour and will make sure that teachers stand along the edge of the emergency lane to make sure cars realise the children are there and drive carefully.’

Lack of resources: The school, Guizhou province, doesn't even have a playground

Duty-bound: The headteacher said that the school faced closure if it didn't host sports lessons

The school has now organised several races where the kids have a running test on the road bridge despite the busy traffic.

‘We know it’s dangerous and is also not that healthy with all the smog, but we don’t have any other choice if we are to stay open.’ said the headmaster.

Poor: Most of the children belong to low-income rural migrant families
