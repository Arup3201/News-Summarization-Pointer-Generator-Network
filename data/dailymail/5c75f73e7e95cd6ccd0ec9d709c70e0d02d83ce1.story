A veteran police officer has been arrested for statutory rape after he allegedly plied a 16-year-old girl with alcohol and sexually assaulted her before his wife found them in bed together.

Peter Ciollo, a 29-year-old New York Police Department officer, has been charged with attempted rape, giving alcohol to a child, endangering the welfare of a child and sexual abuse.

Ciollo, who is married and lives in Staten Island with his wife of four years, was off duty when he allegedly assaulted the 16-year-old girl on July 4.

The victim is his sister-in-law's sister or another immediate relative on his wife's side of the family.

Arrested: NYPD Officer Peter Ciollo, 29, allegedly gave a teenage girl alcohol before sexually assaulting her at his home. His wife, pictured, allegedly walked in on her husband and the girl in bed

He allegedly gave her alcohol before letting her drive his car in the parking lot of the Staten Island Mall and around the neighborhood, police sources told the New York Post.

They then returned to his home and he showed her pornography before kissing her and urging her to remove her shirt, the New York Daily News reported.

He then allegedly took her to bed and began touching her, sources said.

The girl said she doesn't remember what happened next, but she told police that when she woke up, she was in the bed and Ciollo's wife had walked in on them.

Sources told the Post that the encounter may have started out as consensual but 'eventually went too far'. The age of consent in New York is 17.

He married his wife in Staten Island in July 2009. He grew up in Oak Wood, Staten Island and completed a bachelor degree in network management from DeVry University in New Jersey.
