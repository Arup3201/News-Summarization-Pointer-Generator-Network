New life: Tracey Connelly, who  allowed her son Baby P to be tortured to death, has left her bail hostel to start a new life at a seaside resort at the expense of taxpayers

The cruel mother who allowed her son Baby P to be tortured to death has left the bail hostel where she has been living to start a new life at a seaside resort at the expense of taxpayers.

Tracey Connelly had been staying at a half-way house following her release from a Durham prison but probation officers have now allowed her to move into a home of her own.

Connelly, 32, who was jailed in 2009 over the brutal murder of her son Peter, has moved from the hostel in northern England to a flat, and hopes to find employment at the coastal tourist town.

While she searches for a new job, Connelly - who has been given a new name - will receive £72.40 a week in Jobseeker's Allowance as well as other state handouts including housing benefit of around £400 every month and a grant of roughly £750 so she can decorate her new home.

A source at the probation service said that Connelly had wanted to leave the women only half-way house, and it had been agreed that she was ready to start a new life.

She has been released far from Haringey in north London where 17-month-old Peter was killed, and probation officers will continue to monitor her.

'She is hundreds of miles away from where she was, which should increase
 her chances of not being recognised,' the source told the Daily Mirror.

Connelly was jailed indefinitely in 2009 after she admitted doing 
nothing while her little boy was tortured to death by her boyfriend 
Steven Barker and his paedophile brother Jason Owen.

Peter was found dead in his blood-spattered cot at 
his mother’s flat in Tottenham, north London, after suffering 50 
separate injuries, including a broken back.

The case provoked a national scandal after it emerged that social workers, police and doctors missed a series of warning signs that could have saved the child’s life.

As she was granted parole last autumn, Connelly had begged for an anonymity order and round-the-clock police protection, but ministers refused.

These orders are rare and only four are currently in force.

These apply to child killer Mary Bell, James Bulger’s murderers Robert Thompson and Jon Venables and to Maxine Carr, who provided a false alibi for Soham murderer Ian Huntley.

Connelly, who ballooned to more than 22st while in prison before putting on another two stone following her release, has 
been encouraged that as well as changing her name, she should try to 
alter her appearance and was warned not to reveal details of her past.

She
 has been refused £7,000 gastric band surgery because she was unable to 
stop eating junk food. It has been reported that she snacks on eight 
chocolate bars a day and dreams of working in a bakery.

It was alleged that she may have been helped out of her Durham jail in convoy of vehicles carrying 'dummy' obese women.

Sources said that extra vehicles containing women of a similar weight with their faces covered could also be used to throw anyone keen to follow her off the scent.

The same ploy was used when Maxine Carr left prison.

In 2004, when Carr left Foston Hall prison in Derbyshire, she was stowed in the footwell of a car at the same time as several similar vehicles also left.
