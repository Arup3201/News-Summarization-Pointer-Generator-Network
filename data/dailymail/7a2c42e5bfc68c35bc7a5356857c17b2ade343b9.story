It's the controversial  diet that encourages higher fat consumption and has scientists claiming it can reverse the obesity and diabetes epidemics. 

South African sports scientist, Professor Tim Noakes, says there's absolutely zero nutritional value in eating carbohydrates and people should stick to a diet full of fatty goodness.

His claims form part of a Catalyst investigation to air on the ABC on Thursday and he is backed by several high-profile Australians including celebrity chef Pete Evans and cricketer star Shane Watson.

'What this diet does is it's high in fat and protein… that reduces your hunger and that is the key to this whole process because if you can reduce your hunger, your calorie consumption goes down,' Professor Noakes told Catalyst.

'If you follow this diet we can reverse obesity and type two diabetes.'

Professor Noakes' low-fat advice is a far cry from the food group pyramid many have followed for decades, which encourages a high proportion of carbohydrates. 

He believes the surge in carb consumption has contributed to obesity because they stimulate insulin hormones, which increases the body's fat stores. 

Celebrity chef Pete Evans has thrown his support behind the low-carb diet and says people should consume more unfamiliar animal meats including liver, marrow, hearts and brains

Australian cricketer Shane Watson details taking up the low-carb diet after initially having a 'fat phobia' because people had told him to consume a low-fat diet as an athlete

Australian cricketer Shane Watson said he used to have a 'fat phobia' because people had told him to consume a low-fat diet as an athlete. 

'I stayed away from butter, cheese, nuts, avocado - all the foods that are high in fat and high in energy. But in the end I was always hungry because I was cutting all the fat out of my diet and was just loading up on carbs,' he told Catalyst.

He took up the low-carb diet when sports scientist Dr Peter Brukner started working with Cricket Australia and instantly dropped the weight.

Catalyst host Dr Maryanne Demasi says in the program that there's scientific evidence that people with obesity and diabetes would benefit from a low-carb diet - something Dr Brukner agreed with.

'These people don't metabolise carbohydrates well, that's what diabetes it – a failure to metabolise carbohydrates. Yet we've traditionally give these people high carbohydrate diets and it just doesn't make sense,' he said.

The low carbohydrate diet encourages higher fat consumption and limits the intake of carbohydrates.

The diet includes the consumption of foods full of fatty goodness including meats, fish, butter, cheese, nuts and avocado.

But according to the Dietitians Association of Australia, reviews of the diet show that they are successful in cutting down body weight for up to six months.

This suggests that for some people, the low-carb diet may be more effective in the short term.

But the association says there are some concerns with the diet as it encourages a high intake of saturated fat. This may boost health risks such as heart disease and damage to blood vessels.

The association says regular physical activity and a healthy diet is the most effective in the long term.

The Catalyst episode is packed full of experts weighing in on the low-carb diet, but Melanie McGrice of the Dietitian's Association of Australia warns not everyone should follow it.

'I don’t believe that everyone with diabetes should be going on a low carbohydrate diet,' she tells the program.

'People don’t just come with diabetes, they come with a whole range of medical conditions, they come from different back grounds, they have different lifestyles. 

'People who have medical condition such as diabetes really should be going and seeing their accredited practising dietician for that personally tailored advice.'

Celebrity chef Pete Evans, who is renowned for his support of the Paleo diet, chimes in with a low-carb spaghetti recipes including animal liver, marrow, hearts and brains.

'The best thing about this diet is you don’t have to calorie count. Fat equals flavour,' he said. 

Catalyst's Low Carb Diet: Fat or Fiction? will air on the ABC on Thursday at 8pm.
