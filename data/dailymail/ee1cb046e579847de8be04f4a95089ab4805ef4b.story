Refusing to jump on the New Year diet bandwagon, one restaurant has unveiled a deep-fried PB&J beef burger.

PYT in Philadelphia, which claims
 to be 'home of America's craaaziest burgers', added the gut-busting stack to its menu this month.

MailOnline 
estimates, after consulting www.myfitnesspal.com, that the sandwich - 
consisting of two deep fried kettle chip-coated PB&Js, one meat patty and strips of bacon - comes close to 2,000 calories (a McDonald’s Big Mac, by comparison, is 550 calories).

A heart attack waiting to happen! Refusing to get on the New Year diet train, PYT in Philadelphia has unveiled a deep fried PB&J sandwich and beef patty burger

Kim Malcolm, PYT's head chef, told us that there is no polite way of eating the burger and 'you've just got to go for it.'

Describing the taste, she said: 'You start out with a really crunchy texture on the outside and then you get the warm gooiness of the peanut butter and jelly.

'The beef patty is really soft and moist because we marinated it in banana and then you get a kick from the Sriracha sauce at the end.'

When asked how many calories she thinks is in the $15 bun, she replied: 'We don't count calories here, we like to have fun.'

Elaborate process: To craft the gut-busting burger, chefs at PYT deep-fry two peanut and butter jelly sandwiches and then coat them in kettle chips

The PB&J Bun Burger is part of PYT’s Burger of the Week special, and will be available until the end of January.

It isn't the first crazy bun mash-up the eatery has crafted.

Past inventions include the 'Mini Krispy 
Kreme Burgers with Chocolate Covered Bacon', the 'Mac ‘N Cheese Burger' 
and the 'Spaghetti Burger', featuring a bun crafted entirely out of 
noddles.

PYT says of its latest offering: 'Yeah, about those New Year’s resolutions . . .This is the PB&J Bun Burger!Deep fried kettle chip coated PB&J sandwiches are buns, banana-sriacha marinated juicy beef patty, applewood bacon on top.

'This is the over-the-top burger delight that will get 2014 started right!'

The restaurant previewed a photo of the PB&J Bun Burger on its Facebook page last Monday.

Comments
 from bemused viewers included 'how does one even come up with something like this?', 'that's just too much' and 'that sounds delish!'

Ms Malcolm estimates that they have sold a few hundred of the limited-edition buns so far and the phone has been ringing off the hook with inquiries.
