Basketball’s MVP and multimillionaire 'King' LeBron James, 28, finally marries his childhood sweetheart Savannah Brinson, 27, in San Diego, California, this weekend.

The three-day event, guaranteed to be a star-studded and lavish affair, remains shrouded in secrecy with the couple doing everything possible to keep details about their nuptial’s top secret.

The guest list is expected to include a host of star names including Jay Z and Beyonce, as well as LeBron’s Miami Heat teammate Dwyane Wade and his girlfriend Gabrielle Union.

The happy couple have decided upon the exclusive Grand Del Mar hotel and resort as their venue, claims SanDiego6.com.

Hotel staff and pretty much everyone involved with the wedding have been asked to sign non-disclosure agreements, but one tell-tale sign about the venue is about to host something out of the ordinary is the large tent that's been erected outside.

The extravaganza is being organized by celebrity wedding planner Preston Bailey, who also oversaw internet entrepreneur Sean Parker’s $10 million ‘Lord of the Rings’-themed wedding to Alexandra Lenas back in June.

King James' big day could be a slightly more muted affair. The guest list is expected to only number in the hundreds, rather than the thousands that have attended some NBA All-Star’s nuptials.

‘He cut the list down because he didn’t want to have 1,000 people at the wedding,’ a source told the New York Post. This weekend’s wedding also clashes with Yom Kippur, the Jewish day of atonement.

Guests started receiving their ‘save the weekend’ cards, which featured an illustration of the happy couple along with their two kids, back in March.

Festivities are expected to start on Friday evening with a welcome barbecue before the main event on Saturday afternoon. The reception will include cocktails, dinner and dancing to DJs and a live band, there will even be an after-party in a different part of the resort.

Guests will feast at a farewell brunch on Sunday, to close the weekend festivities.

LeBron’s mom Gloria will be in attendance and is expected to take along her boyfriend Da Real Lambo, an obscure rapper who has posted a series of photos on Instagram of him enjoying the good life at LeBron’s expense on the family's recent European vacation.

Other guests are expected to include LeBron’s longtime manager Maverick Carter, New York Knicks star Carmelo Anthony plus wife La La Anthony, Miami Heat president Pat Riley and head coach Erik Spoelstra.

The lovebirds, who live in an enormous $9 million mansion in Miami's Coconut Grove, have dated since high school and got engaged on New Years Eve 2011. They have two sons: LeBron Jr., 11, and Bryce, 6.

King James’ fiance has purposefully sought to shun the limelight for much of his career, but since their engagement was announced has started to engage more with the press and media.

In April she provided prom dresses for about 100 underprivileged girls in her current home of Miami and her hometown of Akron, Ohio.

'I can't imagine being in their situation and not have somebody help,' she said. 'I really care. It's really in my soul to help people, and this is the first baby to come from it. There comes a time when you have to give back.'

Her husband has encouraged his soon-to-be wife to be as visible as she wants.

'I just think she has a knack for being powerful,' said James. 'Women are more powerful than men. Her voice and her being my sidekick, her voice is very powerful, especially to these young women who are underprivileged.'

Brinson admitted that there have been plenty of times when she has been bothered by attention, particularly when stories have come out that simply aren't true.

'I've heard things about me that are bad, where they've literally looked up into the sky and said, "What can they say about Savannah?" It's going to happen,' Brinson said.

'People will say I'm doing this for attention and now that I'm getting married, I'm coming out from behind his shadow, but I just thought it was time. I'm letting these girls know that I'm confident, showing them my personal growth, and maybe it will help them as well.'
