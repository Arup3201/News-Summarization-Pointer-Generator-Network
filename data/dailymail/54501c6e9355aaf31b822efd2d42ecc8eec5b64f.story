Jodie Marsh has never been afraid to go all out for any occasion and it seems Christmas is no exception as she gives her best Bad Santa impression in a red and fluffy white bikini.

The glamour model-turned-body builder happily showed off the results of her intense body training regime in the revealing Santa-themed bikini complete with matching hat while on holiday in Barbados.

Jodie flew out to the Caribbean island to see in her 34th birthday and get away from a 'traditional' Christmas in the UK.

Ho, ho, ho: The bikini showed off the glamour-model-turned-bodybuilder's incredible figure as she soaked up the sun on a beach while on holiday in Barbados

Jodie Marsh wished her Twitter followers a happy Christmas as well as posting a picture of her bum in her new bikini

But, despite telling her Twitter followers she wasn't 'doing Christmas this year', it appeared the model couldn't help but bring a bit of festive cheer to the beach.

The bikini made by Harlequin Bikini is made up of small triangles with a fluffy white fur trim and just about covers the model's ample assets.

And Jodie couldn't help but show it off to her Twitter followers by posting a saucy picture of her on the beach, tweeting: 'Merry Christmas Great Britain!!!!! :-) Here's what I'm doing for Christmas x x x'

Alternative Christmas: The model previously said she 'wasn't doing Christmas this year but appears to have changed her mind

A matching set: The red bikini with white fur trim perfectly matched the colour of Jodie's bright red hair

She then added: 'Just cos it's 30 degrees, doesn't mean I can't get into the Christmas spirit ;-) hahahaha Merry Christmas everyone! X'

The Santa bikini is the latest the model has showed off while on holiday. 

On her birthday, she wore a blue and white snake skin bikini to show off her incredible figure just a few days after trying out a pink bikini that clashed with her bright red hair.

But she seemed especially delighted with her Christmas offering, tweeting: 'This is the best bikini EVER!!!!!'

The glamour model happily showed off her toned body and numerous tattoos which completely cover one of her arms and part of her back
