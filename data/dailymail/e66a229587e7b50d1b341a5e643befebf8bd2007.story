Tulisa was on a high last night, celebrating her debut solo single going to number one and performing the track to much fanfare on one of the biggest shows on television live.

But while the singer was toasting the performance with all of her showbiz friends at a party after Britain's Got Talent, the claws were coming out on social networking sites.

The 23-year-old's live performance was widely slammed by viewers on Twitter, who ridiculed her singing ability and also her outfit choice.

Flat note: Tulisa's live performance of her single Young, and her wardrobe choice,  were panned by viewers on Sunday night

Tulisa made the unusual decision to 
ditch the skyscraper heels and wear flat shoes onstage in order to 
perform the energetic choreography - a move perhaps to be admired for 
her practical, down-to-earth approach, and one you would never see most 
other starlets doing.

'Tulisa love, you really need to 
learn to dance in heels asap, if you want a long-term 
career...#justsayin!' wrote one Twitter user.

Tulisa's black flat shoes were 
certainly practical to dance in, but were not quite as flattering paired
with her black and white dress, which was ripped of to reveal a cropped
top and shorts ensemble.

Points for practicality: Unlike most female performers, Tulisa sensibly opted for flat shoes to make the dancing side of things a little easier, but the look didn't go down well with fans

The singer later changed from her onstage costume into a cream mini dress and heels to attend her after-party.

Some of the scathing remarks about the performance on Twitter included: 'Sorry but tulisa is talentless.'

Another wrote: 'Tulisa was HORRIBLE on Britain's Got Talent. Never have I appreciated Cheryl Cole more!'

Hundreds of tweets made cheeky reference to the star's recent sex tape scandal.

'Oh Tulisa? Give her credit, it was better than her tape,' wrote one.

Some of the less racy remarks included: 'Tulisa disappointed me, not once did she slap the mic on her face.'

And: 'Good luck to Tulisa..she's had it hard recently and had a lot to swallow #BGT.'

No problem walking in them: The singer was pictured returning to her trailer from the stage in her flats, and later leaving the studio in a mini dress and heels

Quizzed
by Ant and Dec over how she felt after her number, she replied: 'Thank 
you very good, feels really good, amazing, thank you for all your 
support.'

Despite the criticism on Twitter, 
Tulisa was in the celebratory spirit as she arrived at the Rose Club 
following the show, to celebrate.

She was joined by her X Factor 
protegées Little Mix, Amelle Berrabah, Chloe Green and her own entourage
at the venue where she toasted reaching number one.

Tulisa
shot to the top of the charts yesterday with her single, topping off a 
stellar week which also saw her named the world's sexiest woman by FHM 
magazine.

The X Factor judge took the spot from Carly Rae Jepsen, whose single Call Me Maybe slipped to number two.

Young was written by Tulisa's ex-boyfriend and former N-Dubz bandmate Fazer.

The
singer tweeted this evening: 'It's always been a childhood dream of 
mine to get a No.1 single! Thank you so much to everyone who bought 
Young. Xx'

She added before her performance: 'Backstage getting ready for BGT! #EXCITED!'

ITV chiefs were thrilled with BGT’s showing on Saturday, when it peaked at 11million viewers to The Voice's 9.1million. BGT also won the highest average rating — 9.5million to 8.2million.
