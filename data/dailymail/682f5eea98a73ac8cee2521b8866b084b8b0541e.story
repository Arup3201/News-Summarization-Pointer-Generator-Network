‘I’ve always wanted to be happy, so I decided to be’. Such are the prophetic words of the most unlikely kit man the game has ever seen.

BBC Two’s drama Marvellous is the story of Neil Baldwin - professional clown, greeter of students, bird fancier and, as Lou Macari (played by Tony Curran) says in this fabulous tall tale of real life, ‘the best signing he ever made’.

Baldwin is played with astounding heart by Toby Jones. But not all the weight is placed on this diminutive powerhouse’s shoulders.

Former Stoke kit man Neil Baldwin had a drama named ‘Marvellous’ aired last Thursday about his life

Because one of the great twists in the way this story is told, is that Toby’s Neil occasionally has a chat with the real Neil. As indeed does the real Macari. And it is a fantastic little dramatic device, because it serves to remind us that we are in fact seeing remarkable, life-affirming things that actually happened.

Neil is one of life’s innocents, who has simply gone about his business with the assumption that if you ask for it, you’ll more than likely get it. We first see him as Nello the clown, because as a kid he wanted to join the circus. So he did.

But when he falls out with the ringmaster, he makes his way home to Stoke-on-Trent and decides to pursue another course. First he turns up at Keele University to, well, welcome students. No one asked him to. He just thought he should. 

But then he meets Macari, the newly appointed manager of Neil’s beloved Stoke City. And before you know it, Nello the clown is the Potters' kit man.

Aside from his relationship with his ailing mum - beautifully played by Gemma Jones - this is the real soul of the story. Because we are seeing a very square peg in an extraordinarily round hole. 

He gets stick from some players. He gets abuse from the crowd. But Neil’s extraordinary ability to insist on always drinking from a glass half full means that he ultimately becomes something of a hero to both - while, at times, dressed in a chicken suit, or doing his Brian Clough team talks in top hat and tails. 

There is even a great actual clip of Macari being interviewed on the Stoke pitch while Neil sneaks into shot to show us what he’s wearing under his comedy kilt!

Baldwin earned Stoke cult status (played by Jones - far right) for stunts such as dressing in a chicken suit

This relationship between gaffer and kit man was clearly so strong, the real Macari confirms at one point to his actor counterpart that he did actually bring Neil on as a sub in a testimonial. Although as the real Neil tells Toby’s Neil when sitting together in the Stoke dug out, he didn’t actually score with the flying header that we see Jones tuck away with aplomb. So perhaps some things are just a bit too extraordinary.

As has Neil’s life, Marvellous features some great little star cameos including Gary Lineker - who helped him recruit players for the Neil Baldwin Football Club - and Uriah Rennie, who turned up to ref a game for him.

And as we see at the end of the programme, Neil Baldwin FC is still a team. Keele University presented him with an honorary degree and the Stoke crowd sings his name. And his church choir was happy to come together to perform a rendition of the club’s anthem ‘Delilah’.

People, it would seem, just can’t help but like doing nice things for Neil.
