Extrem sports fan: Stephen Morton was killed while white water rafting in Alaska

A British father drowned after he was persuaded to try whitewater rafting for the first time on some of the world’s most difficult rapids.

Businessman Stephen Morton, 47, had just finished climbing North America’s highest peak, Mount McKinley in Alaska.

But after completing the 19-day expedition, his three Dutch teammates – who were all experienced rafters – encouraged him to try the extreme sport before flying home.

The boat carrying Mr Morton tipped over entering a dangerous category-five rapid known as the Zig Zag.

All the men were thrown out of the raft, but Mr Morton struggled to recover in the icy cold water.

He was pulled out and taken to hospital where he was pronounced dead.

Last night, his grieving widow said she didn’t want her husband to pursue dangerous hobbies, but hadn’t stopped him in case he regretted missing out.

Vanessa Langlois, 51, said: ‘It is really difficult if your spouse wants to climb mountains, which is dangerous.

'I would have preferred him not to go, but at the same time I thought he could not get to the end of his days and think: “I should have been able to do all of that”.

'I would not have wanted to stand in the way of who he was and those things that he wanted to.’

She added: ‘I don’t feel angry or anything. It was him. He had to do it, to challenge himself.

'He had a sense of adventure and he was always planning the next thing he was going to do. He was going to climb Everest next.

‘He phoned before he left for the rafting trip. He was so happy to have summited safely and was so happy to be coming home, talking about the gifts he was about to buy for the kids.

‘I cannot imagine what it is going to be like without him.’

Mr Morton, who grew up in Fife, lived in Cambridge with three daughters from a previous marriage as well as his seven-year-old son with Mrs Langlois.

He is the fourth person to drown in the rapids over the past 20 years.

Just hours before he died, he wrote on Facebook: ‘In order to recuperate from the climb, I’ve bowed to peer pressure and we are off to do some Cat 5 whitewater rafting. Haven’t done rafting before, but when in Alaska …’

Mrs Langlois, 51, spent ten years with Mr Morton before they got married last July. She said her husband, who served in the Army after leaving school, was the ‘fittest he had ever been’.

‘He had trained meticulously beforehand. He was incredibly fit, he was incredibly strong,’ she said.

The experienced climber, who had previously tackled Kilimanjaro, spent months preparing for the £8,000 expedition during which he had to carry a nine-stone pack and pull a sledge for 19 days.

All the rafters had undergone a test to see how well they would cope if they came out of the boat. However yesterday the company that organised the rafting admitted that Mr Morton did not ‘do particularly well’.

Chuck Spaulding, the owner of the rafting company Nova Alaska, said the firm had started looking into the death but were ‘still putting the big picture together’.
