Millions of families were today spared the threat of having to split up their household rubbish into at least five separate bags and boxes.

A judge rejected a legal bid by the recycling industry - backed by green pressure groups - to enforce rigorous new recycling rules on every home in the country.

The new recycling regime would have required every council to demand that householders separate their rubbish for recycling into different bins for paper, metal, plastic and glass.

Complicated: Seven recycling firms made a legal bid for strict new recycling rules that would force every home in the country to use different bins or bags for paper, metal, plastic and glass - such as this street in Stoke on Trent

The system would have meant families would also have had to use yet more bins for food and non-recycling rubbish, and for garden waste.

Seven recycling firms who are part of the Campaign for Real Recycling - an organisation also backed by environmental groups including Friends of the Earth - said the complicated recycling rules are necessary to meet the demands of the EU's Waste Framework Directive.

Currently, around four in tens homes in England and Wales have rubbish collection rules in force

But in a judicial review heard in the 
High Court in Cardiff, Mr Justice Hickinbottom said it was 
'unambiguously clear' that local councils had a right to set their own 
rules on how to recycle, based on economic and technical practicalities.

The decision comes against a background of continuing political tension over how household rubbish is collected.

Local councils, and both Labour and Coalition governments, have faced discontent from voters following the introduction of compulsory recycling schemes.

These include the notorious fortnightly collection systems and kitchen slopbucket collections in which families can be asked to use as many as nine different bins.

Last month the Department for Environment, Food and Rural Affairs admitted that much of the household waste collected for recycling in fact goes to landfill, and that published recycling figures are exaggerated.

It acknowledged that a high proportion of rubbish put out for recycling by householders is rejected by recycling processors as too impure for use in processing plants.

At the same time DEFRA also conceded for the first time that recycling rules have been set out not to meet any British requirements but to comply with the terms of the Brussels directive.

About four in 10 homes in England and Wales already have rubbish collection rules that demand they use separate bins for paper, metal, plastics and glass.

The recycling firms who brought the Cardiff judicial review said that in order to comply with EU rules householders should be made to ensure that recycling is carefully sorted before it is collected by the binmen.

Waste: DEFRA has admitted that much of the household waste collected for recycling still goes to landfill

Mr Justice Hickinbottom said in his 
ruling: 'They are all members of the Campaign for Real Recycling, and 
their commercial interest in this claim is underpinned by a strong 
belief in the environmental benefits of recycling.'

The companies said the EU Waste 
Framework Directive, agreed in 2008 and which went into operation in 
2010, sets down that 'waste shall be collected separately if 
technically, environmentally and economically practicable, and shall not
be mixed with other waste or other material with different properties.'

But the judge said that the primary objective of the EU regulation was the protection of the environment and public health, not the enforcement of separate collection of waste.

'It would be contrary to principle, and fundamentally incongruous, if the directive were to require separate collection of each of the four waste streams, if such collection were not necessary to achieve the higher objectives of the directive,' Mr Justice Hickinbottom said.

'The evidence before me does not begin to justify the assertion that such collection is in all circumstances necessary for the achievement of the directive's objectives or any of them.'

The judge refused the recycling companies the right to take their claim to the EU's Court of Justice in Luxembourg.

A spokesman for DEFRA said after the judgement was made public: 'This ruling shows our interpretation of the Waste Framework Directive is right.

'It recognises that it is for local authorities to decide, within the law, whether separate recycling collections are necessary and practicable.

'We will continue to work with local authorities, the waste industry and other partners to provide waste services that meet the needs of local communities and improve the quality of recycling.' Â
