Davide Santon says the tweets in which his fiancée criticised Newcastle United were a ‘misunderstanding’ – while Magpies boss John Carver insists it was best for the defender to rejoin Inter Milan.

The 24-year-old was unveiled as an Inter player on Friday having joined the Nerazzurri on loan until the end of the season on deadline day.

His partner, Chloe Sanderson, posted a series of messages in which she claimed Santon had been forced out of Newcastle and was ‘disgusted’ by the treatment of him.

Santon has rejoined his first professional club Inter Milan on loan from Newcastle until the end of the season

Santon made 94 appearances for The Magpies and scored one goal during a four-year spell on Tyneside

Santon, however, has played down her comments and claimed it was a misunderstanding.

Meanwhile, head coach Carver says the former Italy international had become frustrated on Tyneside.

‘Davide got a little bit frustrated with himself because he wasn’t in the team,’ he said.

‘The best option was to send him out on loan and that’s what we’ve done.

‘He’s not featured all season - he’d had a problem with his knee.

‘The emergence of Paul Dummett and Massadio Haidara are two guys at left-back who have done really well.

‘He was finding it a problem to get in the team.’

Newcastle face Stoke at St James’ Park on Sunday and Carver has confirmed that the game will come too soon for Siem de Jong, who is on the comeback trail after four months out with a torn thigh muscle.

Midfielder Siem de Jong signed for Newcastle from Ajax in the summer, but has been injured for four months 

He is playing U21 games at the moment, but is not fit enough to face Stoke City in the Premier League
