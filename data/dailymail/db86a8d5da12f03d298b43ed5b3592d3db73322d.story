A benefits cheat who pocketed £15,000 claiming he could barely walk was caught out after being secretly filmed playing in midfield for his pub football team.

Raymond Billam, of Bolton-on-Dearne, South Yorkshire said he was severely disabled because of problems with his knees and back as he claimed incapacity benefits.

But unknown to him, fraud investigators had been tipped off and secretly filmed the 38-year-old playing football for his Sunday league side.

The 38-year-old (centre after passing the ball during a Sunday league game) said he was severely disabled because of problems with his knees and back - but was still able to play as a midfielder in his pub side

Billam claimed he needed crutches to get around and was virtually unable to walk more than a few metres unaided, a court heard.

But for nearly five years between 2008 and 2013 he pulled on the green shirt of Ingsfield Lane in the Mexborough and District Sunday League, South Yorkshire, putting in crunching tackles and running several miles in a match.

Billam admitted defrauding the Department of Work and Pensions by pocketing £15,000 in benefits to which he was not entitled.

Barnsley Magistrates Court was told by prosecutor Julie Grant that he played 87 games mainly for pub sides over several seasons.

She added: 'Mr Billam said he could only walk 20 metres before he felt discomfort. Investigators saw him playing football. He was running and jumping.

Billam had claimed he needed crutches to get around - but a court heard that he had been playing football regularly for five years

'Mr Billam said when he was quizzed that he had good days and bad days.

'He said other people may have played football using his name. He became coy when he was asked further questions.'

District Judge John Foster warned Billam he could be sent to prison.

He said: 'The nature of the deception and the amount of money falsely claimed means I do not rule out jail or sending you to the crown court for a stiffer sentence than can be imposed here.'

Billam's solicitor Chris Peace reserved his right to put his defence later.

He will be sentenced next month and was granted unconditional bail.

A spokesman for the DWP fraud team said: 'Billam was very brazen about what he was doing.

'It's hard to believe someone can think they are entitled to incapacity benefits because they claim they can't walk far without assistance.

'Yet we observed him on three consecutive Sundays, running around, jumping and heading the ball and putting in some strong tackles.'
