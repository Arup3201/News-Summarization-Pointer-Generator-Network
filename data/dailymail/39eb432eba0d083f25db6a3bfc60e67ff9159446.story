Two women have been caught on camera viciously attacking a blind, elderly Australian Aboriginal man while he was sitting down in the disabled seat of a bus.

The video, which was filmed on a mobile phone by a 13-year-old girl travelling on the bus on Australia's Gold Coast, shows the two women punching, kicking and spitting on the 77-year-old vision-impaired man.

Shocked commuters watched in horror as the women physically and verbally abuse the indigenous man, who is seen in the footage cowering against a window.

SCROLL DOWN FOR VIDEO

Disturbing: Video footage shows these two women punching, kicking and spitting on a blind, elderly Aboriginal man while he is sitting on a public bus

No match: The male victim, who is pictured here trying to fight back against the physical and verbal attack, sustained bruising to his arms and his glasses were broken

The women, who appear to be dressed up for a day at the races or a wedding, are heard in the video saying ‘Oh bro, we’re in Abo land here, hold on’ before they begin to punch and kick him while he is sitting down, breaking the terrified man's glasses.

The teenage girl filming the disturbing encounter pleads with the women, one of whom has a large tattoo on her right thigh, to ‘leave the poor man alone’.

A male passenger then intervenes after the girls spit in the elderly man’s face, forcing them off the bus and throwing their handbags out after them.

It is understood the foul-mouthed women started attacking the man when he told them to ‘go back to where you came from’.

Gold Coast District Acting Superintendent Brian Swan said the victim, who sustained bruising to his arm, had made a statement to police and wanted to press charges.

Supt Swan said police suspected the perpetrators were aged 17 and 21 but were yet to locate and interview them.

'We did receive a lot of calls from the public,' he told reporters.

'Quite quickly this morning we were able to identify who we believe were responsible.'

Supt Swan said the man suffered bruising to his arm.

'As you can imagine, he is quite upset and shaken by the incident,' he said.

He said the women could face serious assault charges, which carry a maximum sentence of seven years' jail.

The women appeared intoxicated in the video, he said.

Police Minister Jack Dempsey said the incident was an 'absolute disgrace'.

'It's deplorable to think that an individual can think they can use this type of violence against an elderly person on a public transport vehicle,' he said.

The incident follows a spate of similar ones on Australia’s public transport.

In June, where police charged a 55-year-old woman for racially vilifying an Asian schoolboy on a bus in Burwood, in Sydney’s west. That incident was also caught on camera.

Another video shows a pregnant women being called a ‘fat s...’ after she asked a train passenger in Perth to move her bags so she could sit down.

In November 2012, a French woman on a Melbourne bus was told to ‘speak English or die’ by a man who also threatened to cut her breasts off.

All three videos were posted on YouTube.
