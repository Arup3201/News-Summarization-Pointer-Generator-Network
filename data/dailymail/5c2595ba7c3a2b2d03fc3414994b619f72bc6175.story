A romantic boyfriend has given his girlfriend an eternal Christmas gift in the form of a very festive surname.

Alex Christmas, 25, proposed to his girlfriend Stephanie Sewhee and she happily agreed to become Mrs Christmas.

For Alex, from Tadley, Hampshire, the proposal had been a long time coming having met Stephanie four years ago while she was working as a sales assistant at a Debenhams store in their home town, where Alex was a security guard.

Alex Christmas proposed to his girlfriend Stephanie Sewhee on the foundations of their new-build home in Basingstoke

The couple had both secretly wanted to tie the knot however other ventures in their lives had kept both Stephanie and Alex preoccupied.

They have been saving for three years to buy a home of their own, while living with Alex's parents in Tadley, Hants and Alex had wanted to wait until they had bought the house before popping the question.

The couple had been visiting the grounds of their new build home in Basingstoke, Hants when Alex got down on one knee.

Stephanie, now a ticket office agent at Reading Football Club, immediately said 'yes' and the couple celebrated with champagne.

Stephanie, also 25 from Basingstoke, said that the proposal had come as a complete shock as she admitted that they had both been focused on moving home.

Stephanie says that she can't wait to take on her boyfriends festive surname, admitting that they are both big fans of this time of year

'I've known for a long time that I wanted to marry Alex and become Mrs Christmas.

'But we've been so focused on planning and saving for our new home that I wasn't expecting him to propose at all.

'When we got to the site of our new home and he said we'd be putting our handprints in the foundations, I thought that was the only surprise he had planned.

'Then I turned around and he was down on one knee. I didn't know what was going on at first, but the minute I realised, I said "yes".'

Stephanie added that she was thrilled to be taking on her fiances festive surname. 

The couple had been putting their hand prints into the concrete foundations of their new-build when Alex proposed, Stephanie instantly agreed 

'I am so happy - I can't wait to be Mrs Christmas. We are both really festive - so the name is pretty fitting!

Alex, a customer service representative, said that for him, the proposal couldn't have come at a better time.

'We'd talked about getting married and I had always planned to do it when we moved into our new home.

'We are so excited and can't wait to take that next step in our lives together.'

The couple hope to move into their house at the beginning of next year and marry in June 2016 But for now, they are looking forward to celebrating their favourite time of year.

'We'll be spending Christmas day with Alex's family in the morning, and my parents in the evening' said Stephanie adding that for the moment they are still very focused on moving house.

'We've both agreed not to buy presents and save for our new home, but I will still probably get him a little something.

'I can't not get a present for Mr Christmas himself!'
