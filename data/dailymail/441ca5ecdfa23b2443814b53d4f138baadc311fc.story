'Barça are the best club in the world and coming here is a great opportunity for me. I'm very proud to be here in Barcelona.'

The 30-year-old centre back has penned a four-year deal with a contract that carries a buy-out clause of £39.5 million.

Mathieu has been brought in to replace Carles Puyol at the heart of Barcelona's defence following the retirement of their former captain.

Javier
Mascherano has previously played that role but it is believed Enrique 
has earmarked him for a spot in midfield after his performances in that 
position for Argentina at the 2014 World Cup helped them reach the 
final.

Mathieu is likely to compete alongside Gerard Pique and Marc Bartra for a place in the heart of Barcelona's defence.
