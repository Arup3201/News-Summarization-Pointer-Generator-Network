More claims: John Travolta is facing new groping allegations today

Three more men has claimed Grease star John Travolta sexually assaulted them.

A New York-based masseur alleges Travolta groped him during a massage at a five star hotel around two years ago, RadarOnline is reporting.

The website quotes a source 'close to the situation' who says Travolta groped the unnamed man against his will during an in-room massage.

'Travolta indicated that he wanted much MORE than a massage,' the source told RadarOnline.

'He also claims that there was alcohol present in the room and that Travolta encouraged the man to drink with him during the time of the massage.'

The website reports the masseur is now 'assessing his legal options'.

And another masseur at the posh Eden Roc Resort in Miami and a former hotel employee at the Westin Hotel in Seattle have also come forward, according to the New York Daily News.

The news comes after the the first two unnamed masseurs to come forward - dubbed John Doe #1 and John Doe #2 - parted ways with lawyer Okorie Okorocha.

But both have hired celebrity lawyer Gloria Allred and may take up the lawsuit again with her.

Ship worker Fabian Zanzi came forward with similar claims last week, accusing Travolta of accosting him back in 2009 while he was working on the Royal Caribbean cruise ship.

An unnamed gym employee also alleged this week that Travolta fondled him against his wishes when he worked out at the gym while he was shooting a movie, according to RadarOnline.

Aside from the five sexual assault claims, former massage therapist Luis Gonzalez made claims to the National Enquirer he had a homosexual tryst with Travolta at the Ritz-Carlton Hotel in Laguna Niguel, California, in 1997.

On top of this, there was more anguish for Travolta yesterday when it was reported he tried to give his  Grease co-star Jeff Conaway oral sex while he was sleeping.

Travolta allegedly tried to perform the act at Conaway's home in the 1990s, Conaway's former fiancée Vikki Lizzi told the National Enquirer.

She said that her partner, who played Kenickie in the 1978 hit movie, was so upset with the incident it ended his long-term friendship with the star.

Conaway died last May, aged 60, from complications of pneumonia.

Travolta's lawyer Marty Singer is yet to comment on today's allegations - but previously said: 'As a result of the published lies about my client we expect some 'John Does' to come out of the woodwork and assert false claims.'
