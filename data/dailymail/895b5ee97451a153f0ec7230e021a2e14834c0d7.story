Ed Miliband used a speech at Islington Town Hall to warn five million people in Britain are not earning the living wage

Ed Miliband’s plan to force thousands 
of companies to pay a ‘Living Wage’ could be illegal – and leave the 
taxpayer open to compensation claims, Downing Street warned yesterday.

No 10 said ministers had no plans to 
follow the Labour leader’s call to require all government suppliers to 
pay a ‘Living Wage’ of up to £8.55 an hour.

A spokesman said that, although Mr 
Cameron had backed the Living Wage campaign in opposition, the 
Government’s legal advice was that forcing firms to pay it would 
potentially break European Union procurement laws.

Labour described the 
Government’s response as ‘pathetic’ and said expansion of the Living 
Wage initiative could benefit up to five million low-paid workers.

And, in an intervention that will 
embarrass Mr Cameron, London Mayor Boris Johnson announced that the 
Living Wage in the capital will be increased by 25p an hour to £8.55.

The rate outside London was increased by a similar amount yesterday to £7.45 an hour.

Someone earning the new London rate 
would make almost £5,000 a year more than someone working 40 hours a 
week on the National Minimum Wage of £6.19 an hour.

Mr Johnson, whose Greater London 
Authority is committed to paying the higher rate, called for all local 
authorities in London as well as Whitehall to pay the Living Wage.

‘By building motivated, dedicated 
workforces, the Living Wage helps businesses to boost the bottom line 
and ensures that hard-working people who contribute to London’s success 
can enjoy a decent standard of living,’ he added.

Mr Miliband was greeted at Islington Town Hall to mark the start of Living Wage Week by shadow chief secretary to the Treasury, Rachel Reeves

Mr Miliband said the Living Wage could
help tackle Britain’s ‘living standards crisis’.

He added: ‘Too many 
people in Britain are doing the right thing and doing their bit, helping
to build the prosperity on which our country depends, but aren’t 
sharing fairly in the rewards.’

But Government sources said yesterday 
that forcing employers to pay a certain wage in order to bid for public 
sector contracts was potentially in breach of EU laws.

A previous attempt to require 
government suppliers to pay a special minimum wage in one region of 
Germany was ruled illegal by the European Court of Justice.
