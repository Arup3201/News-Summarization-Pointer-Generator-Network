A bright idea: A yellow bicycle... complete with its own rather Gallic stuffed rider

It started in the land of brie, croissants and berets – but this weekend, the Tour de France rolls into the land of Wensleydale, parkin and flat caps.

And it couldn’t be receiving a warmer welcome.

With ‘Le Grand Depart’ set to provide a £100million boost to the economy, notoriously thrifty Yorkshire folk are only too keen to cash in. Some locals are renting out homes along the route for as much as £10,000, while others have sold spots in their gardens for hundreds of pounds.

Room rates at conveniently-placed hotels have trebled, and farmers’ fields and village cricket pitches have been transformed into money-spinning campsites or car parks.

Gary Verity of Welcome to Yorkshire, which successfully bid to host the race, praised the ‘natural entrepreneurial spirit of the people of Yorkshire’ and said ‘millions’ would be watching this weekend’s two stages - which are followed by a final UK stage from Cambridge to London.

In preparation, some £6million has been spent by councils in ‘God’s own county’ on filling potholes and repairing roads on the route.

It hasn’t been an entirely smooth journey, though, as residents have complained that nearby roads in far worse condition have been left untouched – and German cyclist Marcel Kittel, one of the favourites for the opening stage, has insisted the roads through the Dales are still ‘very dangerous’ because they are so narrow.

Nevertheless, from tomorrow the world’s best cyclists will wind their way through cities, towns, villages and across the spectacular Yorkshire Dales countryside.

The first 
stage is the 118-mile stretch from Leeds to Harrogate, then on Sunday 
it’s 124 miles through the Peak District from York to Sheffield.

Spectators
 are expected to line every part of the 242-mile race route this weekend
 and no expense has been spared to ensure a prime view.

A northern welcome: A lesson to riders on what not to do while cycling along the roads of Yorkshire

Spotted: The Bank View Cafe in Langsett has had a make-over to celebrate the Tour de France. The red and white polka dot jersey is handed to the 'King of the Mountains' winner in the race

James Rawlinson, 65, who lives in the West Yorkshire village of Oxenhope, said a man from Scotland offered him £300 to let his wife and two children stand on step ladders in his yard.

‘I bit his hand off,’ he said.

Mr Rawlinson said another neighbour had ‘sold’ his garden space for £500.

Meanwhile, the owner of a cottage close to the stage two summit at Holme Moss was asking £10,000 for the week, while a six-bedroom home in Harrogate was listed yesterday for £8,000. 

Alistaire Macgregor, a tennis coach from
 Holmfirth, set up a campsite with the help of a local farmer and is 
charging £45 for a weekend pitch.

A handmade Eiffel Tower has been installed in Burley-in-Wharfedale, near Ilkley in Yorkshire as the county embraces the spirit of the Tour de France

He said: ‘We’ve had hundreds of people book.’

And with bunting and yellow bicycles evident in just about every town and village, some are going to ever more imaginative lengths to stand out.

The Bank View Cafe at Langsett, near Sheffield, has been repainted white with red dots to match the King of the Mountains jersey.

And in the village of Burley-in-Wharfedale, scouts and guides have helped the Prest family build a 25ft version of the Eiffel Tower as the race is going past their front door.
