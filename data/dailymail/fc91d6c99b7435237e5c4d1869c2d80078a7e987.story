More to do: road safety minister Stephen Hammond said while the 2011 drink-drive fatality figures are second lowest ever, he wants to reduce them further

Drink-drivers who fail a breath test by a small amount could be stripped of their right to a blood or urine test.

Ministers aim to remove the statutory right to a second test when a breath test reading is just above the legal limit.

This will close the loophole giving drivers time to sober up while they wait for a blood or urine sample to be taken.

Some 8 per cent of those arrested for drink-driving opt for a second chance blood test.

A quarter of those who have done so in a police station where there is no on-hand doctor have escaped prosecution.

A Government consultation document, published by road safety minister Stephen Hammond, says ministers aim to ‘streamline enforcement against drink-driving’.

They also plan to give police the option of skipping the secondary breath test, usually conducted at a police station.

'I am determined to make the jobs of those who deal with drink-drivers easier and less bureaucratic so that bringing offenders to justice is not left to chance,' Mr Hammond said.

Currently, suspected drink-drivers are given a preliminary test and must then go to the police station for a second test on a breathalyser machine whose results are reliable enough to be used in court as evidence.

The Government is hoping to roll out sophisticated mobile roadside ‘evidential’ breath test devices, which will remove the need for a trip to the police station.

These devices are not currently in use but are expected to receive Home Office approval next year.

The report says: ‘This would mean that an officer can conduct an evidential breath test in places other than at a police station or hospital, including at the roadside, without the need for a preliminary screening test.’

Similar roadside test devices for drug-drivers are also awaiting approval.

Mr Hammond said: ‘We have made great 
progress in tackling drink-drivers and the 2011 fatality figure for 
drink-and-drive accidents is the second lowest ever recorded.

‘However,
last year, 280 people died (in these types of accident), ruining the 
lives of families up and down the country, so more needs to be done to 
eradicate this menace.’

He said: ‘That is why we are taking forward a package of measures to streamline enforcement against drink-driving.'

New plans: A police officer holds a breath test kit. The Government plans to crackdown on drunk motorists who use legal loopholes by choosing a blood or urine sample while they sober up

Currently,
drivers who record less than 50 microgrammes of alcohol per 100ml of 
breath have the right to demand a blood or urine test - despite being 
over the legal limit of 35 microgrammes per 100ml.

This
is known as the statutory option. It dates back to the original 
introduction of earlier ‘blow in the bag’  breathalyser technology when 
there were concerns over reliability.

The Government also wants to give registered health care professionals – and not just doctors - greater roles in testing drink-drivers and drug-drivers.

They will be able to take evidential blood samples in hospitals and to assess whether a driver may be impaired because of drug.

Ministers say this will enable tests to be carried out more swiftly, easing the pressure on doctors who are currently the only professionals with the authority to carry out the tests.

Other proposals within the plans include further research into the process used to decide whether a driver banned due to drink-driving can regain their licence.

There are also plans for the greater use of powers to seize vehicles to get the most dangerous and irresponsible motorists off the road, including drink-drivers.

The moves follow the recent review of drink and drug-driving by Sir Peter North who recommended the removal of the right to demand a blood or urine test as evidence showed people were using it as a delaying tactic.

The Government believes that improvements in the accuracy of technology means that this option is no longer necessary.

RAC
Foundation director Professor Stephen Glaister said: 'The law is full 
of unintended consequences and it seems correct to close a loophole 
which allows drink-drivers to escape rightful prosecution.

'In
future the roadside technology is up to an adequate evidential standard
then this is the place to determine if wrong has been done.’
