Robert Downey Jr's son Indio was arrested yesterday after cops found him with cocaine, echoing his father's very public struggle with drug addiction in the 90s.

The 20-year-old was riding in a car in West Hollywood Sunday afternoon when an L.A. County Sheriff's deputy conducted a search of the vehicle and found the illicit drugs.

Law enforcement officials told TMZ that Indio was riding in the car around 2pm, near the intersection of Santa Monica Boulevard and La Cienega, when a police officer drove up alongside the vehicle and noticed a passenger smoking something out of a pipe.

The Sheriff's deputy pulled the car over and conducted a search, finding Indio in possession of cocaine.

The Iron Man star's son was booked in L.A. County jail and released early Monday morning on $10,250 bail.

Downey has since issued a statement, thanking the police for their intervention, while expressing the belief that his son can be a 'recovery success story instead of a cautionary tale.'

'Unfortunately there’s a genetic component to addiction and Indio has likely inherited it. Also, there is a lot of family support and understanding, and we’re all determined to rally behind him and help him become the man he’s capable of being,' the 49-year-old actor said.

This isn't the first time Indio has gotten in trouble for drug abuse.

In October 2013, the National Enquirer reported that Indio had been admitted to a rehab facility for prescription pill abuse.

At the time, Indio's mother Deborah Falconer, told the magazine that her son's problem was not that bad. 

'He was not addicted,' she said. 'He was taking one pill a day.'

Sources close to the family told TMZ that Indio has been in and out of treatment facilities for years, and that his father  has been deeply involved in getting him help.

'Because of Robert's own struggle he's very much in tune with his son's sobriety. And that has really helped Indio,' one source said told the outlet.

The sources said Downey partly feels guilty for his son's suffering, since he too knows what it's like to be an addict.

Downey and Falconer had their son in September 1993, and Indio grew up as his father struggled to stay away from marijuana, cocaine, heroin and prescription pills.

Falconer and Downey split in 2001, after she became frustrated with his multiple trips to rehab and jail.

Downey abused drugs for most of the 90s, and was even jailed in 1999 for missing a court-ordered drug test.

During one court hearing in 1999, Downey told a judge that he had been a drug addict since age 8, when his fellow addict father started supplying him with marijuana. In a 1988 interview, Downey said he grew up in a house where there was 'always a lot of pot and coke around'.

'When my dad and I would do drugs together, it was like him trying to express his love for me in the only way he knew how,' Downey said.

Downey finally got clean in 2003, when he dramatically threw all of his drugs into the ocean following a life-changing trip to Burger King.

He told Empire magazine that he was driving in a car full of 'tons of f***** dope' when he stopped at the fast-food chain to get a bite to eat.

'I have to thank Burger King,' he said. 'It was such a disgusting burger I ordered. I had that, and this big soda, and I thought something really bad was going to happen.'

So he drove to the beach and unloaded his stash, vowing to end the dangerous habit.

It was also around that time that he met future-wife Susan Levin, who was producing his film Gothika.

Downey proposed to her in November 2003, but Levin only agreed to go through with the marriage if the actor became sober for good.

Downey then started therapy, entered a 12-step program, took up meditation and started the martial art Wing Chun Kung Fu and described kicking drugs as like coming out of a '20-year coma'.

'The old saying is true – behind every good man there's an incredible woman. I owe a huge amount – if not all – of my success to Susan. We make a great team, and all that luck I spoke about, that's Susan,' he said.

Since getting clean, Downey has experienced a career comeback, starring in such films as Iron Man, Sherlock Holmes and Tropic Thunder.

Downey and his son have worked together as actors before, when a 12-year-old Indio played a younger version of his father's character in Kiss Kiss Bang Bang.
