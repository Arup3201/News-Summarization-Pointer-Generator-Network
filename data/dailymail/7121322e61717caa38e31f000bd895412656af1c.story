Gus Poyet says he could have been sacked in any other country following the humiliation of an 8-0 defeat.

Sunderland face Arsenal at the Stadium of Light on Saturday with Poyet still in charge despite equalling a club-record loss at Southampton last weekend.

And the Uruguayan said: ‘In another country, maybe an 8-0 defeat means that you lose your job. In England, that is not the case – at the moment.

Poyet watched his Sunderland players trudge off the St Mary's turf after their heavy loss 

‘I’ve seen it in the past. I have seen other teams lose 8-0 and nothing happens, and the manager is still managing and the players are still playing. Everybody moves on, which is fine. But I can tell you, that it is only here.’

On Tuesday, Poyet and his players gathered in the auditorium-style meeting room at the club’s training ground and reluctantly worked through the horror of their capitulation at St Mary’s.

Some of those culpable tried to offer explanation for their actions, but still the manager could not comprehend the ‘embarrassment’ which had unfolded before him.

On Saturday night, having flown back to the North-East amid a muted atmosphere, he remained at home, refusing even to venture out to a restaurant.

The following day he again chose to remain indoors – he did not want to see his players – painstakingly poring over the calamitous clips needed for the team meeting.

The players, it is said, have been quiet this week and no-one will speak to the press before the game. Such was the margin and manner of defeat, only a reaction against Arsenal can right their wrongs. For now, words can wait.

There was, however, a gesture from the squad to supporters amounting to around £60,000 in refunds for their match tickets, but most fans have indicated that they will instead allow the money to go to charity.

Rather, it is a performance they want on Saturday afternoon. Poyet, though, preferred not to talk of reactions and cut a confused and disturbed figure when he spoke to the press on Thursday, perhaps that was the lingering effect of shock.

‘I was unpleasantly surprised,’ he said. ‘Why? Because I swear I didn’t expect that to happen to me. The way that we were, the way that we defended, the way the players were on the pitch, the type of group that we want the players to be – everything.

‘It was horrible. I stayed in all weekend. But I am on my own and am a bad cook, so I had to go out eventually.’

In the wake of the defeat Poyet suggested he was not responsible for the depth of his squad. ‘I have four defenders, I play four defenders’ he delivered cuttingly. The club have moved to address that shortfall by bringing in 34-year-old former France defender Anthony Reveillere and he could start against the Gunners.

There will also be changes elsewhere with Poyet admitting he can ‘do what he likes’ with regards team selection and no-one could knock on his door to complain.

The 46-year-old saw a different side to several players at Southampton, although when asked if he had lost faith in any individuals, he said: ‘No... Not yet.’ The pause was telling.

For no matter how hard he strived for optimism, Poyet was repeatedly drawn back to Southampton and the reason as to why his players surrendered in such sorry fashion.

‘I was lucky never to have been in that situation,’ he said. ‘But maybe it’s not luck, maybe I didn’t allow my team-mates to put me in that situation.

‘I think the most I conceded was six, against the dream team of Barcelona. I can tell you they could really play. I don’t want to think about what would have happened if we had been playing them on Saturday, it might have finished 25-0.’

Now 25-0 would have got Poyet the sack. As it is, 8-0 affords him a shot at redemption.

Another heavy defeat, however, and local restaurant takings will be down for a second weekend running. It would certainly give the club’s owner food for thought.
