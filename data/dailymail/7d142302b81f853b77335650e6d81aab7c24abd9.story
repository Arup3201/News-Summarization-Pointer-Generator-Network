The sister of racing ace David Coulthard died from an overdose of a widely-used prescription drug.

At the time of Lynsay Jackson’s death last year, it was thought the 35-year-old had died from a suspected heart attack.

But now, following the outcome of toxicology tests, her death certificate has been updated, showing that  the Formula 1 star’s younger sister died from a ‘Propranolol overdose’.

Lynsay Jackson (pictured with her brother, David Coulthard, on her wedding day in 2011) died from an overdose of a widely-used prescription drug, it has emerged

The drug - technically known as a beta-blocker - is prescribed for a variety of common health problems, including heart and circulatory conditions, from tremors to high blood pressure, as well as helping to reduce the symptoms of anxiety such as a rapid heart rate or sweating.

It is also a treatment for other ailments, from migraine headaches to hyperthyroidism and glaucoma.

However the drug has been linked to other deaths - most notably, the American actress Brittany Murphy.

Propranolol was found on the bedside table of the Clueless star after she died suddenly in her Los Angeles home in December 2009, after suffering from flu-like symptoms and shortness of breath.

Mrs Jackson, whose baby daughter Emilie was just 10 months old at the time, was thought to have suffered cardiac failure at her home in Crossmichael, Kirkcudbrightshire, in the early hours of the morning, after going to bed complaining of stomach pains.

She was discovered by her husband, Will, an environmental health officer whom she married in the summer of 2011.

Following her death on 9 February last year, police confirmed there appeared to be no suspicious circumstances, and a report was sent to the Procurator Fiscal.

An initial entry on the General Registrar for Scotland, in Edinburgh, listed the trained nurse’s cause of death as ‘unascertained, awaiting laboratory results’.

But it has now been corrected on official public records to show Mrs Jackson, who had been undergoing a keep-fit regime, including running and a bodyfit bootcamp, succumbed to a fatal dose of Propranolol.

Yesterday medical experts said that propranolol was usually a safe drug but that care had to be taken to ensure the correct dose was taken.

Former GP Richard Simpson, now Scottish Labour’s public health spokesman, described beta-blockers, and Propranolol in particular, as ‘excellent drugs’, which had made ‘a difference to many people’s lives’.

In a moving tribute at her funeral, Mr Coulthard said: 'I will remember her on her wedding day, she looked beautiful, in love with Will'

But the MSP added: ‘Like most drugs, you have to take great care and they must be used with caution, according to the prescription. The side effects of Propranolol can include the heart excessively slowing down and the patient feeling weak and tired. People react differently and what is a good dose for one person, might not be right for another. There’s nothing to be frightened about if you are taking these but you do need to make sure the dose is suitable for the individual.’

At the couple’s home, Mrs Jackson’s widower last night declined to discuss the circumstances of his wife’s death.

And a spokeswoman for David Coulthard, who has lived for many years in Monaco, said he was currently travelling and unavailable for comment.

Speaking after her death, which occurred while her parents, Joyce, 66, and Duncan, 67, from Twynholm, in Kirkcudbrightshire, were on holiday in Australia, the racing driver spoke of the family’s grief, saying: ‘It’s obviously come as a huge shock to us all and we’re still trying to come to terms with it.’

Coulthard himself was told the news about his sister just moments before he was due to appear on the BBC show, Saturday Kitchen Live. He was given the option of dropping out of the show by producers, but instead decided to appear on the 90-minute programme hosted by TV-chef James Martin.

He later said: ‘It just seemed like the right thing to do and what Lynsay would have wanted. My parents were in Australia and I discussed their travel plans with my father. We agreed to meet back in Scotland the next day.

‘I’ve since thought a lot about the decision. I do wonder if my sporting career helped me to detach myself from the reality and just get the job done. But the show also helped me to fill those hours. I knew no amount of reflection could bring her back. It felt like there was little I could do to help in Scotland.’

The pair, who also have an elder sibling, Duncan, were known to be extremely close and, until 2005, ‘Super Chick’ – as she was nicknamed by her family -  ran her brother’s fan club, as well as the official David Coulthard motoring museum in Twynholm.

In a moving tribute at her funeral, Mr Coulthard, 42, said: ‘I will remember her on her wedding day, she looked beautiful, in love with Will.’

Following her death, friends paid tribute to Mrs Jackson as ‘a wife, a mother and a free-spirit’.Praising his sister’s driving skills, Coulthard, who lives with former Belgian model Karen Minier and their young son, Dayton, once described his sibling as ‘naturally a better driver’ than him when they were growing up, while she jokingly confessed that ‘boys got in the way’ and she ‘lacked his dedication’.

In 2001, the driver – who made his Formula One debut in 1994 and won 13 Grand Prix before his retirement from the sport several years ago - honoured her with ‘her dream birthday present’ when he dedicated his first victory of the season in Sao Paulo to her.

Just days earlier the then 
24-year-old had moaned about not receiving a birthday present from her 
brother but was reduced to tears when she later saw him on television 
saying his win in Brazil was in her honour.

Speaking
 at the time, she said: ‘I phoned David last Tuesday to wish him a happy
 30th birthday and he said he had not managed to get me a present.

‘I was a bit miffed so when he won in Brazil and announced it was dedicated to me it was the best birthday present ever.’

She added: ‘We watched the race on a German channel and they have breaks which seem to last half an hour so we kept having to phone home to Twynholm. When David finished the final lap we were ecstatic.’

After his win, the driver said: ‘It was my sister’s birthday and she asked me for a win, so I dedicate this race to her. This is my 10th win and the best feeling I have had after a victory.’

Propranolol is one of the most widely used drugs in treating heart disease, hailed as a life-saver for millions of patients around the world.

But its potentially harmful side effects mean it must be used with caution. It is a beta-blocker which weakens the effects of stress hormones on the heart muscles, airways, arteries, kidneys and other nervous system tissues.

Beta-blockers are particularly used for the management of irregular heartbeat, high blood pressure and for preventing patients who have suffered a heart attack from suffering another.

But if propranolol is taken in too high a dose, it can slow – and eventually stop – the heart.

The drug was implicated in the death in 2009 of US actress Brittany Murphy.

The 32-year-old star of the film Clueless died of a heart attack after collapsing in the shower of her Los Angeles home.

She was said to have been taking prescription drugs for ‘flu-like’ symptoms. Propranolol was among ten separate drugs found in her bedroom.
