High-profile Muslim scholars have taken to YouTube to warn terrorists holding British aid worker Alan Henning that their actions are 'totally prohibited' under Sharia law. 

The latest plea to free the former taxi driver from Manchester who travelled to the region as an aid worker last year is made by a judge on the Sharia council in London, a director of Prophetic Guidance and an Imam.

It comes after more than a hundred representatives from Britain's Muslim community signed a letter urging Isis to release the 47-year-old who appeared at the end of a video last Saturday in which fellow captive David Haines was killed.

Judge Shaykh Haitham Al Haddad (pictured), a judge on the Sharia council in London, said executing Alan Henning would be 'prohibited according to Sharia'

Ustadh Abu Eesa (pictured), a director of Prophetic Guidance, is based in Manchester and said on the YouTube video that he would 'personally vouch for' Alan Henning

In a YouTube video Judge Shaykh Haitham Al Haddad said: 'This is to confirm that executing this man is ... impermissible, prohibited according to Sharia.'

Ustadh Abu Eesa, a director of Prophetic Guidance, is based in Manchester and said he would 'personally vouch for' Mr Henning, adding that his would-be killers are defacing the religion of Islam.

Imam Shakeel Begg, of Lewisham Islamic Centre quotes from the Koran, explained that there is 'no justification in our religion that allows you to continue to hold him let alone harm him'.

Footage earlier this week showed Mr Henning with other aid workers on the Greece-Turkey border in December last year saying the dangerous journey to Syria is 'worthwhile' to help those in need.

 On Thursday a video of British photojournalist John Cantlie was released, showing the hostage reading from a prepared script, saying he would talk about the self-proclaimed IS movement.

Unlike previous Isis videos there was no threat made on camera to Mr Cantlie's life. 

Meanwhile, Turkish Prime Minister Ahmet Davutoglu said today that 49 hostages who were seized by Islamic militants in Iraq have been freed and safely returned to Turkey.

The announcement brings to an end Turkey's most serious hostage crisis.

The hostages were kidnapped from the Turkish Consulate in Mosul, Iraq on June 11, when the Islamic State group overran the city in its surge to seize large swaths of Iraq and Syria.

Their release contrasts with the recent beheadings of two U.S. journalists and a British aid worker by the Islamic State group.

But it wasn't immediately clear what Turkey had done to secure the safe release of the hostages or where the release took place.

Deputy Prime Minister Bulent Arinc said the hostages are 49 Turkish consulate employees - 46 Turks and three local Iraqis - including Consul General Ozturk Yilmaz, other diplomats, children and special forces police.

The hostages were released early on Saturday and had arrived in Turkey, Davutoglu told Turkish reporters during a visit to Baku, Azerbaijan.    

Davutoglu said the release was the result of the intelligence agency's 'own methods,' and not a 'point operation' involving special forces, but didn't elaborate.

'After intense efforts that lasted days and weeks, in the early hours, our citizens were handed over to us and we brought them back to our country,' Davutoglu said.

Meanwhile, President Recep Tayyip Erdogan said the Turks were freed through 'a successful operation.'

'I thank the prime minister and his colleagues for this operation which was pre-planned, whose every detail was calculated, which lasted through the night in total secrecy and ended successfully this morning,' Erdogan said in a statement.

Thirty-two Turkish truck drivers who were also seized in Mosul on June 6 were released a month later. Turkey did not provide information surrounding their release.
