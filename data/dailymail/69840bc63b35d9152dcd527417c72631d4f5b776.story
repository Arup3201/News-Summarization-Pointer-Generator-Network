Fraud: David Hodges could soon be practising as a doctor again after a panel ruled his fitness to practise was no longer impaired by his conviction

A millionaire doctor, who pretended he was deaf to get signed off sick by the NHS so he could concentrate on his private work, could be allowed back to work today eight years after he was struck off.

Dr Michael Hodges, 56, pocked a fortune from his private clients and used the cash to fund a life of luxury, with a convertible Jaguar and an Audi TT parked on the drive of his £1.5million Essex home.

The ‘greedy’ medic, who was also paid paid £250,000 a year by the NHS, also employed his wife as a receptionist at his surgery, despite the fact she barely ever set foot in it.

Hodges worked at Clayhall Clinic in Ilford, Essex, but had claimed mild deafness and tinnitus made him unfit to work.

He convinced bosses at the NHS he was unable to work at the surgery because of it, using medical evidence from an ear specialist.

The surgery was left in the hands of locums who were paid £17,000 by the NHS to cover him and keep the 5,000-patient practice afloat.

But the dodgy doctor was carrying out up to 16 lucrative medical examinations a day and made more than £100,000, despite a claim he could barely communicate with patients.

The fraud was uncovered when an NHS colleague spotted his name on the door at Roding Bupa Hospital in Ilford when he was signed off sick.

Hodges was jailed for 12 months at Southwark Crown Court in July 2004 after being convicted of 12 counts of false accounting.

The shamed doctor served just three months of the term behind bars before he was granted early release.

At a GMC hearing in 2005 the panel found that his fitness to practise was impaired and struck him off the medical register.

The panel ruled it was in the public interest to erase Hodges’ name from the register for the ‘serious abuse’ of his position of trust.

But the former medic could now be allowed to return to work after he applied to be restored to the medical register.

The panel at the Medical Practitioners Tribunal Service in Manchester has already decided that his fitness to practise is no longer impaired by reason of his conviction.

They will now assess whether he still has the skills to work as a doctor after eight years out of the profession.

Speaking on behalf of the GMC, Charles Garside QC said: ‘The major issue, as the GMC saw it, as to whether the conviction were to lead to a finding of impairment is decided already and decided against the GMC’s position.

‘I have no submissions to make at this stage of proceedings.’

The panel was presented with evidence that Hodges passed all areas of a professional assessment carried out on the recommendation of the GMC.

Mr Hodges urged the panel to ‘accept my competence and restore my name back to the medical register.’

He said: ‘I think my hearing has been very fair and detailed.'

‘I feel I have proven my competence in a thorough professional assessment recorded by the GMC.'

If the panel decide he is now fit to practise he can return to practicing medicine in the UK without restrictions.

He indicated to the panel that he intends to undergo re-training at the Kent, Surrey and Sussex deanery.

At the time of his conviction, Hodges had a £1.8 million mortgage on five properties.

In 2001 he had sold his share in Mobile Doctors - which provide medical reports for ‘no win, no fee’ claim companies - for £3million.

His wife Sue was paid £29,500 by the trust for her work as a receptionist using her maiden name of Archer.

Hodges had claimed she was working 21 hours a week but she hardly set foot in the surgery.

Detectives found that he had also faked a contract of employment for his wife.

During the time Hodges claimed to be too ill to work he provided medical services to a range of firms including British Aerospace and the MOD.

Hodges also provided an occupational health service for Tesco’s head office in Cheshunt, Hertfordshire, and saw private patients at his fully equipped surgery at home in Manor Road, Woodford Green, Essex.

During his trial Hodges had insisted his deafness made NHS consultations impossible but he could still carry out private work.

The hearing continues.
