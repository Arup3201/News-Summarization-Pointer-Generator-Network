A newly-married couple were left stunned - and the bride in tears - when they were hit with a $4,000 bar bill after celebrating their wedding at Sydney's posh ARIA restaurant - despite agreeing beforehand that the tab must be capped at $1,500.

Blake and Sam Howard were enjoying their dream day as they mingled with about 50 guests at the Opera House restaurant, owned by celebrity chef Matt Moran, on Friday.

But their celebrations were ruined when they were handed the bill as they went to leave - and realised it was $2,500 more than they had agreed, not including a compulsory $800 charge for gratuities and a further $1,000 deposit.

The couple said the monster tab put their dream honeymoon - a two-month trip around Europe and Africa - under threat because they had to max out their credit cards to settle up, despite generous donations from guests.

‘I was flabbergasted to say the least,’ Mr Howard, 29, told Daily Mail Australia just hours after the nuptials.

‘I told them they would have to take the clothes off my back because I have nothing to give them.’

'I don't know what we would have done without the help of our family and friends.'

Mr Howard said he and his new wife had held two meetings with ARIA staff in the lead-up to their big day during which it was agreed that the couple would cap the bar bill at $1,500.

‘I told them to tap me on the shoulder as the bill got to $1,500,’ he said. ‘But they said that we should have put it in writing.

'At no point did they claim any responsibility or offer to reduce the bill. I was right there - all they had to do was tap me on the shoulder.'

The newly-named Mrs Howard said the situation was very disappointing considering the staff, who helped organise their wedding, were fully aware of their budget.

'They knew about our two-month holiday – we had a small intimate wedding for that reason,' she said. 'We chose ARIA out of every possible venue in Sydney.'

Feeling on top of the world - little did the couple know that the rug was going to be pulled from under their big day

Mr Blake said management showed no empathy whatsoever other than offering the couple a payment plan for the outrageous amount.

‘It literally went from the best day to the worst day of our lives,’ he said.

'They just played technicalities and nonsense. There was no culpability or partial blame.'

The bride said she was in a complete state of disbelief when her new husband told her the devastating news.

‘I thought it would it was going to be a completely cruisy day – we were all having such a great time,’ she said.

‘It’s rare to get away with no issues – all we had was windy weather to contend with  - I would have been happy with torrential rain but this just took the cake.’

After many tears and tantrums, the couple were left with no choice but to pay the hefty bill thanks to the generous help of their family and friends.

The newlyweds managed to pull themselves together and go out with their loved ones as originally planned

‘I’ve calmed down now – I’m a little less tense,’ Mrs Howard said. ‘I’m not ashamed to say I was standing on Macquarie Street crying – I was ready to throw it in and go to bed at 4pm.’

'I didn’t know how we were going to get up in the morning but the positivity has remained with the people around us.'

With the couple's credit cards now at their limits, they are not sure how they are going to survive on their honeymoon beyond the first few weeks.

'We deliberately had an intimate wedding so we could go on a long holiday. Now we don't know how we are going to afford it,' she said. ' We had planned, prepared and structured the whole wedding to our budget but this was out of the ball park.'

Daily Mail Australia contacted ARIA on Friday but a manager declined to comment.
