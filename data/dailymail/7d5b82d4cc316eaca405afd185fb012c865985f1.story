A widow has received flowers from her late husband from beyond the grave - after he arranged for her to receive a Valentine's Day bouquet every year for the rest of her life.

Shelly Golay, 52, from Casper, Wyoming, said she was stunned when flowers were arrived from her husband of 28 years, Jim, who passed away last June after being diagnosed with an inoperable brain tumor.

'Happy Valentine's Day Honey. Stay Strong! Yours Forever, Love Jim,' read a note with the flowers.

Certain their children had sent the bouquet, she only learned the truth when she called the florist.

Stunning: The message on the flowers reads, 'Happy Valentine's Day Honey. Stay Strong! Yours Forever, Love Jim' - but she didn't believe the flowers were actually from him until she called the florists

'Until the day I die I'll get Valentine's flowers on Valentine's Day and that's just a testament of his love all over again,' she told KCWY. 

'He's such an amazing man and he is just can love beyond boundaries, there is no boundaries with him. Even in death, he's just amazing.'

Jim Golay, who was just 53 when he passed away, had contacted the florist to set up the gift after he was diagnosed with glioblastoma last February.

Florist Jessie Row explained that he requested that every Valentine's Day his wife receives some of her favorite flowers, including assorted roses.

Mrs Golay received the flowers two days before Valentine's Day and called Row. 

'We all started almost bawling,' Row said. 'It was really touching to hear the story and know that he had done that for her. It seems like something that only happens in the movies or that you hear about.' 

Loved: She said that the gesture showed that her amazing husband could love 'beyond boundaries'

Shelly said she plans to preserve the flowers from her husband to remember this Valentine's Day.

The couple married in 1986 and went on to have a daughter Ashley, now 28, and son Colton, 25. The couple ran Rocky Mountain Industrial Supply together.

His obituary describes a hard-working, fun-loving family man.

'William James Golay was a big man, in more than physical stature,' it read. 'His motto, "Go Big or Go Home" was how he lived his life. He never backed away from a challenge and led his family all the way.

'He was the stand-up guy, the faithful Captain for God, the larger than life husband and father, always there son, brother, uncle and friend.'
