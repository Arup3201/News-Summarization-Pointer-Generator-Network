'Rider safety is Uber’s #1 priority. We take reports like this seriously and are treating the matter with the utmost urgency and care.' 

This message from ride-sharing company Uber was seen when a D.C. driver was accused of sexually assaulting a sleeping passenger.

It was also seen when an Atlanta driver allegedly pulled a gun on a valet. And when an Orlando driver reportedly touched a rider under her blouse.

Victim: Roberto Chicas was attacked by Patrick Karahaj, 26, with a hammer after he and two friends argued over the route Karahaj was taking

Buzzfeed published a collection of statements the company released in the wake of eight incidents where drivers were accused of bad behavior or were involved in a crash.  

Groper: Ramy Botros, an Orlando Uber service provider, groped a female passenger and said she was dressed like she was 'asking for that'

The announcements seem to follow a boilerplate formula, beginning with the representative talking about rider safety being Uber's priority, saying the company will respond with the 'utmost urgency and care.'

In certain instances, the spokesperson will say they are suspending the driver or saying Uber is ready to aid investigators, as they did when an Alabama driver was found with weed and an open bottle of vodka in his vehicle.

The statement quoted by NBC after a San Francisco UberX driver struck a passenger in the face with a hammer touched all the bases.

'Safety is Uber's #1 priority,' said Eva Behrend 'We take reports like this seriously and are treating the matter with the utmost urgency and care.' 

'It is also our policy to immediately suspend a driver's account following any serious allegations, which we have done. We stand ready to assist authorities in any investigation,' Behrend added.

According to a blog post on Uber's site, their policy is to conduct background checks on drivers that include looking at criminal history going back seven years.

In the San Francisco hammer incident, the driver had a felony conviction from 2009 that the company missed for reasons that are not clear.

Recently the company has faced criticism over rider safety.

The Chronicle reported that the district attorneys of San Francisco and Los Angeles called some practices of Uber and two other ride-sharing companies a 'continuing threat to consumers.'

Uber has not responded for comment as of yet.
