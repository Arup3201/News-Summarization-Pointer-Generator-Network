They are an incredible insight into the changing face of music lyrics - and even show that perhaps Justin Timberlake really did bring back sexy, in song lyrics at least.

A US artist has created these amazing graphs detailing the popularity of certain key words in song lyrics of Billboard hits.

They reveal that in fact, since Justin Timberlake's 2006 hit SexyBack, the word really has spiked in popularity in music lyrics.

Mission accomplished: A US Us artists has created graphs detailing the popularity of certain key words in song lyrics of Billboard hits - and found that since Justin Timberlake pledged to bring sexy back in his 2006, its popularity has rocketed in song lyrics

The JT Effect? The horizontal axis is the year of the song and the y-axis is the song's popularity according to Billboard Year-End Hot 100 singles. The more red a song is, the more often that particular word appears appears in the song. For example, if a song has 5 "love" words and a total of 100 words in the entire song, that song is assigned 5% and a particular shade of color.

In each graph, the horizontal axis represents the year the song was released and the vertical axis is the song's popularity according to Billboard Year-End Hot 100 singles.

Each cell represents a song, and the more red a song is, the more often that particular word appears appears in the song.

Artist and researcher Nickolay Lamm created the graphs as part of a project calledÂ  'Money, Love and Sex,' which delves into the trending lyrics of Billboard hits.

It tracks the popularity of certain key words in song lyrics, tracing how their use has expanded or declined over time.

'A lot of the songs on the radio are very sexually explicit, and I know I'm not the only one to make that observation,' he told MailOnline.

'I made a guess that songs back in the day, in the 60s to 80s had lyrics that were a lot more friendly and talked about love.

'I wanted to see if these assumptions were true.'

Lamm worked with a programmer on the project to create a huge database of song lyrics.

'I had to build a database of lyrics, and manual checking of their accuray. I then created a program to build these graphs, and worked with a programmer to do this - although the logic came from me.'

The project was originally to analyse just three words - money, love and sex.

However, after building the system, Lamm decided to expand its scope.

'I thought I'd check some more, and the project grew from there.'

Once he decided to expand the project, Lamm added words such as "home," "lonely," "weed" and 'ass'.

The more red a song is, the more often that particular word appears appears in the song.

For example, if a song has five 'love' words and a total of 100 words in the entire song, that song is assigned 5% and a particular shade of color.
