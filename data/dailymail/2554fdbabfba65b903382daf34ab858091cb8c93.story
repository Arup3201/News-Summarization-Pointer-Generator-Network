Malcolm Layfield said his position was 'untenable' and said last week he 'deeply regrets' his behaviour

A top classical music professor whose affairs with pupils sparked the sex scandal engulfing world-famous Chetham’s School of Music quit yesterday.

Malcolm Layfield, who was head of strings at the Royal Northern College of Music, was accused by Frances Andrade of preying on students.

He said he had resigned from the Manchester-based college as his position was ‘untenable’.

Mrs Andrade committed suicide during the trial of Mr Layfield’s former colleague at Chetham’s, Michael Brewer, who indecently assaulted her as a schoolgirl. But the court heard that it was her fury at Mr Layfield’s appointment to one of classical music’s most eminent posts that first made her determined to expose Brewer’s crimes.

Married Mr Layfield, 61, taught at Chetham’s – also in Manchester – alongside Brewer. He has admitted sexual relationships with at least six pupils, some of whom were just 16.

It was stated all the girls were over the age of consent and the ‘liaisons’ were ‘consensual’.

His appointment to the RNCM in 2002 provoked the resignation of concert pianist Martin Roscoe as head of keyboards.

At the time the Daily Mail published claims by former pupils accusing Mr Layfield of plying them with alcohol and seducing them, then using his influence to deter them from complaining.

Despite the outcry – award-winning pianist Kathryn Stott also quit, accusing him of abusing his power – Mr Layfield remained in his post.

He took sick leave from his post following the conviction of Brewer and his ex-wife, both 68, for indecently assaulting Mrs Andrade.

Last week Mr Layfield resigned as a governor of the RNCM, saying: ‘I made it clear then as I do now that I deeply regret my behaviour.’

Since the Brewers’ conviction earlier this month detectives have received more than 20 complaints about historic sexual abuse by as many as six past or present Chetham’s teachers.

They include Chris Ling, now a classical music agent in California, and Chopin expert Ryszard Bakst, who died in 1999. Mr Ling has vehemently protested his innocence.

Last week Wen Zhou Li, 57, who taught violin at Chetham’s and the RNCM, was arrested on suspicion of rape. He was released on bail and ‘strenuously’ denies the allegations.

Six hundred classical musicians have signed a petition demanding an inquiry into abuse at music schools.
