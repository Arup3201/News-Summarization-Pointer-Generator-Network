A 22-year-old woman's suicide should be re-examined, forensic experts said this week after finding flaws with the initial investigation.

Sheena Morris was found hanged in a
 Florida hotel room on New Year's Day 2009, hours after she reportedly 
fought with her 48-year-old fiancé Joe Genoese.

A closed-door review panel met last month to go over the  Bradenton Beach police investigation into her death. A final decision on whether Miss Morris's suicide will be re-examined is down to the local chief of police.

Case reopened: Sheena Morris, 22, was believed to have committed suicide in 2009 but now a panel of forensic experts have recommended her death be re-investigated

Miss Morris's mother Kelly Osborn has
 refused to accept her daughter took her own life three years ago and 
has relentlessly pursued the belief that someone murdered her.

Ms Osborn 
has continually criticized the police work and hired her own team of 
private investigators, claiming that her daughter's death was staged.

The panel of 15 experts, assembled by the Florida Department of Law Enforcement, were not involved with the original case.

Detective Lenard Diaz, who investigated originally, presented his case to the group, according to the Herald Tribune.

After going over evidence and reviewing witness 
accounts from the tragic death, the panel recommended the case be reopened. 

However the final decision lies with Bradenton Beach Police Chief Sam Speciale who has declined requests to reopen the case in the past.

In August, Chief Speciale said he 
would work with the task force but that crime scene evidence still 
pointed to a suicide and he stood by that verdict.

However he added: 'If (the team) looks at it and finds 
something that we didn’t see, or that the other agencies didn't see, 
that's great. That's why we're here.'

Rocky relationship: Sheena, 22, and her 48-year-old boyfriend Joe Genoese had allegedly had a domestic dispute in the hours before her death

Investigation: The parents of Miss Morris have accused police of botching the investigation into her death at the Bridge Walk Resort on Anna Maria Island

Ms Osborn and Sheena's father David Morris, have long believed that their daughter was killed and the hanging in the bathroom at Bridge Walk Resort on Anna Maria Island staged.

She told Fox News: 'The shower was dusted. There were no fingerprints, not even hers.'

Prior to Miss Morris's body being found, guests in the next room had dialed 911 around 1am on January 1 to 
report a domestic disturbance from the couple's hotel room.

Mr Genoese then reportedly left the hotel and returned to his apartment in Tampa, an hour's drive away.

According
 to the account on the family's website, Justice4sheena.com, Miss Morris called the police department
 close to her home in Hillsborough County at 2am because she wanted officers to check it over.

In a taped recording, a young woman's voice can be heard saying that he was 'going to ruin her apartment because she ruined his life'.

Mystery: Questions have been raised by a panel of forensic experts over the suicide of 22-year-old Sheena Morris

Tragedy: Sheena Morris's parents have never believed that their daughter committed suicide and have campaigned relentlessly for the investigation into her death to be reopened

Some 13 hours later, hotel staff heard Miss Morris's dogs barking in her hotel room and called police. Her body was discovered in the bathroom.

Her fiancé Joe Genoese was not named as a person of interest in Miss Morris's death as the tenant of his Tampa apartment, Marcos Claudio had seen him that night. 

However in April, Mr Claudio said he could not be sure of the exact time he saw Mr Genoese as he had been drinking on New Year's Eve.

The chief medical examiner for the 
Florida district changed the 26-year-old's cause of death from suicide 
to undetermined, as the theory that her death may have been staged 
destabilized his original verdict. 

The
 cold case team, which was not reopening but 'reviewing' the suicide 
according to police, will make its findings in around two months.
