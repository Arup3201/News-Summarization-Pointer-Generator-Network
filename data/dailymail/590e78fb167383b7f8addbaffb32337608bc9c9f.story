As well as visiting the Jurassic Coast and having a photograph next to the cliff which started the first series off, die-hard Broachchurch fans can now go one better.

DI Alec Hardy's, played by David Tennant, home in the hit ITV drama is up for sale. 

The tiny wooden blue hut on the banks of the River Brit in West Bay, Dorset, has gone on the market for £275,000 as the so-called 'Broachchurch effect' kicks in.

The blue chalet made famous by David Tennant's character in Broadchurch has gone on the market for £275k

David Tennant broods: Series producers reportedly hired the chalet for two separate periods of two weeks

Previously let as a holiday chalet for as little as £41 per night, the 100 year old two-bed waterfront property has recently been swamped with interest since Broadchurch first aired in 2013.

It's one of four homes built around 1900 next to the River Brit, can only be reached by foot and has the unique position of looking out across the harbour, river and meadows behind.

Series producers reportedly hired the chalet for two separate periods of two weeks while filming the ITV drama, home to David Tennant's brooding lead character.

When asked about the proposed uplift in price thanks to the show Malcolm Gill, of estate agents Lyme Coast Holidays, said, 'It's impossible to quantify but I would say it has probably benefitted from an uplift of between £25,000 and £50,000.'

'We have tried to price it fairly and sensibly without being greedy and I think the owner will be pleasantly surprised to achieve the asking price.'

He may be right to be optimistic as hotel searches to West Bay, Dorset, have  seen an increase of 50 per cent, according to research conducted by hotel.com, and house prices in the picturesque areas have risen by the same amount. 

Britbank is described on Lyme Coast Holiday's website as a 'very unusual Edwardian seaside home'

The blue hut called Britbank is described on Lyme Coast Holiday's website as a 'very unusual Edwardian seaside home right on the riverbank of the river Brit and only a few yards from the sandy beach and the iconic hamstone cliff which also featured in the series on location in West Bay'.

It says that while the chalet has successfully been a holiday let for the past two years the artist and sculptor owner, Abbey Evans, has decided to put it up for sale.

The tiny property was spotted by Chris Chibnall, the creator of Broadchurch, who lives in nearby Bridport

David Tennant and Olivia Colman in character: Chibnall has said chalet 'holds lots – if not all – of the secrets'

The property was spotted by Chris Chibnall, the creator of Broadchurch, who lives in nearby Bridport, when he was writing the first series in a local café.

At the time, Tenant's character was still being developed and it is thought that much of the second series was then created around the idea of the Jurassic Coast chalet as Tenant's base. Chibnall has said the chalet 'holds lots – if not all – of the secrets'.

Mr Evans, 60, bought the chalet in 2000 and said it held wonderful memories for both him and his son.

'I am sad to let it go and if my circumstances were different, I would try and keep it on,' he told the Telegraph. 'I had a lot of good times there with my son. His surfboard is still in the roof with lots of old fishing rods.'

'I just hope the horrible murder won't put people off,' he joked.

As a warning to would-be Broadchurch tourists the estate agents note that they are happy to 'arrange a viewing for those that are genuinely interested in acquiring Britbank'.
