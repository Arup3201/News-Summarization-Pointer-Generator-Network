The beard is greyer, and the hook is absent – but there’s no mistaking whose mugshot it is.

Abu Hamza, who has finally been extradited from Britain after an eight-year legal battle, posed for a first photograph on American soil after arriving at his new prison.

The 54-year-old, whose hands were blown off by a bomb, has already complained about his hook being confiscated. Guards deemed it a security risk.

Staring ahead: Radical Islamic Abu Hamza al-Masri poses for this mugshot following his extradition from Britain to the U.S.

Hamza, who also lost his left eye, added that he is not being treated in a ‘civilised’ manner.

The fanatic is said to be in solitary
confinement for 23 hours a day at the Metropolitan Correctional  Centre
in New York, with rules banning him from speaking to other inmates.

The preacher has pleaded not guilty 
to facilitating violent jihad in Afghanistan and trying to set up a 
terrorist training camp in Oregon.

He also denies involvement in the 1998 kidnapping of Western tourists in Yemen. Three Britons and an Australian were killed.

Four others who were extradited along
with him denied their charges as well. Hamza, who appeared at a brief 
hearing in Manhattan last week, will return to court on October 26.

His trial has been provisionally scheduled for next August.

Preaching: Abu Hamza speaks during what was his regular Friday prayer meeting outside Finsbury Park Mosque, north London, on 14 May, 2004, shortly before he was arrested

Last week it emerged that his wife 
Najat Mostafa could make £75,000 by exercising her right to buy her 
£1million council house in Shepherd’s Bush, West London.

She has ignored requests to downsize to a smaller property.

During his initial court appearance his lawyer Sabrina Shroff asked a judge to return the metal hooks - but was turned down.

Hamza is having to eat all his food 
through a straw. According to prison sources Hamza will be given a pair of cable operated rubber hands.

New York based prosthetic maker Arimed said the hands would be custom made for Hamza.

Non electric prosthetics costs between $5,000 and $8,000 each, while high spec models featuring sensors can cost up to $55,000.

Caged: While he waits to go on trial - which could take anywhere from nine months to two years - Hamza will remain in a bleak New York jail

Hamza, who faces months in jail 
before being put on trial, will be given the cheaper option, according 
to law enforcement sources.

'We have people on contract. We'd have someone come in a do it,' said a law enforcement source.

'The rule is you give the guy what they had before. Not anything better.'

Hamza lost his hands after mine exploded while he was fighting the Soviet army in Afghanistan.

He
was extradited to the US after an eight year legal battle on terrorism 
charged stemming from attempting to open a terror camp in Oregon and 
assisting in the kidnapping of 16 tourists, including two Americans, in 
Yemen.

Earlier this month the 54-year-old 
pleaded not guilty to facilitating violent jihad in Afghanistan and 
trying to set up a terrorist training camp in Oregon.

Abu Hamza was arrested at his London home in May 2004.

Ironically, he was processed using 'fast track' rules which were introduced at the start of 2004 in a bid to avoid lengthy legal wrangles when extraditing to the U.S.

Previously, it took around a year for extradition to go ahead. But it would be EIGHT YEARS and five months before Hamza set foot on American soil.

By removing the need for presentation of a prima facie case it brought procedures between the UK and U.S. more in line with extradition arrangements to European countries.

But, even then, Hamza had two opportunities to appeal - and when those failed his lawyers used every excuse they could to further delay his removal from the UK for years.

The then Home Secretary, David Blunkett, boasted about the new system: 'It will mean much closer co-operation and cut out much of the paperwork which has led to unnecessary delays in the current system and allowed criminals to exploit loopholes and deliberately thwart justice.'

He
also denied involvement in the 1998 kidnapping in Yemen of Western 
tourists in which three Britons and an Australian were killed.

Hamza
appeared at Manhattan’s Federal Court wearing a navy blue jumpsuit with
a brown T-shirt underneath, the standard garb of a high security 
prisoner at the ‘Supermax’ jail where he is being held.

He was not wearing his hooks leaving the stumps clear for the public to see and spoke only once during the 30-minute hearing.

The scale of the investigation was also made clear by prosecutor John Cronan who revealed that the US District Attorney has 8,500 documents, four hard drives and 24 DVDs of evidence against Hamza.

Some of the evidence to be used in the trial may also come from British authorities, although Mr Cronan did not elaborate further.

Hamza’s laywer Jeremy Schneider said after the hearing that his client was having a ‘hard time’ in the grim Metropolitan Corrections Centre.

He added that as far as he understood
it prison guards had been giving Hamza his hooks back for part of the 
day but not permanently.

Hamza was one of five people extradited to the US from Britain to face terrorism charges.

Adel
Abdel Bary, 52, Khaled al-Fawwaz, 50, Syed Talha Ahsan, 33, and Babar 
Ahmad, 36, have all plead not guilty to the charges against them.

Hamza will next appear before the court on October 26.

A provisional trial date has been set for him on August 26 next year.

Compared to previous photos of the preacher before he was imprisoned in 2004, he has aged and his beard is almost completely grey

Disgruntled face may be due to the fact he is now without his hook - he is not allowed them while awaiting trial on terrorism charges
