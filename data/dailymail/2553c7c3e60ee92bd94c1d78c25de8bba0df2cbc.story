Ed Miliband's leadership has come into question after a recent poll put the Tories ahead of Labour

Ed Miliband’s leadership was under fresh scrutiny last night after another poll showed the Tories ahead of Labour.

Andy Burnham, the former Health Secretary, was even being touted by some MPs as an emergency replacement for Mr Miliband to avoid ‘catastrophe’ at the next election.

The latest poll, carried out by former Conservative treasurer Lord Ashcroft, deepened Labour turmoil by giving David Cameron’s party a two point lead.

Last week the two parties were level pegging, but yesterday’s survey found the Tories on 32 per cent and Labour on 30 per cent. The Liberal Democrats were down at just 7 per cent. UKIP was still riding high on 17 per cent – the same as last week.

It indicates Mr Cameron’s conference speech and the Tories’ promise to scrap the Human Rights Act did not persuade many voters to return to the fold.

Worryingly for Mr Miliband, the poll indicates a collapse in the number of people who voted Lib Dem in 2010 switching to Labour.

Labour had a 15 point lead over the Tories among Lib Dem switchers in last week’ s poll, but now the lead is just 4 per cent, indicating that Mr Cameron is managing to steal many former Lib Dems away from Mr Miliband.

The Ashcroft survey comes four days after another polling organisation, YouGov, found the Conservatives had a 1 point lead.

One former Labour frontbencher said last night that it looked increasingly likely that the party could lose seats at the next election.

‘Labour MPs are tearing their hair out,’ he said. ‘They are utterly despondent; they think Ed Miliband’s conference speech was terrible.

‘If it carries on like this, we face catastrophe next May.

‘Increasing numbers of people from across the Parliamentary Labour Party want to see him go – not just people who didn’t support him four years ago, but increasingly people who did support him as well.’

Polling shows more than half of Labour supporters prefer one of the other party leaders to Ed Miliband on five key issues including immigration, Europe, law and order and defence.

Andy Burnham, the former Health Secretary, is being touted by some MPs as an emergency replacement for Mr Miliband

Things have got so bad that some Labour backbenchers are calling on Home Secretary Alan Johnson to step up to the challenge and replace Mr Miliband as leader – although he has indicated he does not want the job.

Last night another MP said that Mr Burnham is increasingly being spoken of as someone who could restore the party’s fortunes in the seven month run-up to the election.

Labour’s health spokesman received the best reaction at the party conference in Manchester last month – a far cry from the response to Mr Miliband’s poorly-received speech.

‘The only person who could do it reckon is Andy Burnham,’ said the MP. ‘Some of the other contenders like Chuka Umunna and Rachel Reeves are younger and they are more likely to wait until the election and then strike.

‘But Andy Burnham has the experience and the wherewithal to become leader before the election, should things fall that way.’

He added: ‘Ed Miliband is the problem – just those two words. The party is disillusioned and the way things are going we will be doing well if we end up in coalition with the Liberals.’

A former minister said he would also like to see Mr Burnham take over – but said it was unlikely there would be a change before the election.

A former Labour frontbencher believes Ed Miliband should stand down as he 'isn't the right person' to lead the party into an election

‘Ed Miliband isn’t the right person, but Labour is loyal to its leaders,’ he said. ‘We should be a lot further ahead in the polls – and I think we would be if we had a different leader.

‘Andy Burnham would be better but perhaps he needs a bit more time. At the moment we’ve got the leader we’ve got.’

Another MP said: ‘Our election result could be even worse than 2010 – it’s not inconceivable. No one who is undecided is going to look at David Cameron’s speech and Ed Miliband’s speech and vote Labour.

‘The Tories look and sound hungrier than us, their message clearer, their leader is more compelling. The best thing for Ed Miliband to do would be to stand down.’

But John Mann, Labour MP for Bassetlaw, said he did not support a change in leader, saying the idea that it would change the party’s fortunes was ‘simplistic and naïve’.

He said: ‘In order to win, there needs to be bigger dose of Northern realism.’

YouGov president Peter Kellner said yesterday that Mr Miliband has ‘more reasons than David Cameron to be apprehensive’ about the coming months.

He wrote in a blog post that Labour’s core vote strategy may fail because its base is ‘fragile and urgently needs strengthening’.

‘There has been talk of him pursuing a core-vote strategy: seeking to hold on to a 35 per cent vote share at next year’s election and hoping that this will be enough to make him Prime Minister,’ said Mr Kellner.

‘Implicit in media discussions of the core-vote strategy is the assumption that these are all firm party loyalists, and that Miliband’s task is simply to mobilise them. The trouble is, they aren’t.’
