A schoolboy described as 'a model pupil' was barred lessons after shaving his head to raise money for Macmillan Cancer charity because his school says he has set a bad example.

Year nine pupil Stan Lock, 13, from Wrington, Somerset, decided to lose his thick brown hair after a number of friends and family were struck down by the disease.

The model pupil had the trim on Sunday after setting up a donation page for Macmillan Cancer care - with some teachers from Churchill Academy at North Somerset giving him money.

But he was devastated when he went to school the next day and was told his number zero hairstyle was against the rules. 

He is banned from attending lessons and spends all day inside an individual booth, including lunch and break times.

Staff  have said he must stay in exclusion until his hair had grown back to at least a number two - which could take weeks.

His mother, Mel Rees, 47, said she was extremely proud of her son's decision to shave his head  and helped to set up a JustGiving page.

But now she says she is furious at the school's decision.  

She said: 'When he came home on the Monday evening he said he was really worried that he was in serious trouble over the cut.

'The next day he ended up in isolation and was told that he would have to stay there until his hair grew back to at least a number two.

'I've tried speaking to the headteacher but he says if he lets one student off with it the other 1,400 might follow. It's madness.

'On Tuesday Stan was saying that he almost regretted do it, which is such a shame. Luckily now he's had so much support he's enjoying it and he realises that what he has done for charity is a great thing.

'He's a model pupil, he's on track to do really well, it's not as if he's a troublemaker or a little rebel trying to stick two fingers up at the school.'

Stan hoped to raise just £100 from the head shave but has now raised more than £1,200 as news of the school's reaction has spread.

Stan said he is 'upset and disappointed' that he is being punished for trying to do a good deed

Friends have rallied around and set up a Facebook page calling for his release, a petition and have even started posting #freestan on posters around the school.

Stan said: 'I decided to shave my head because cancer is horrible and people I know have been affected by it, so I decided to do something to help.  

'On Monday teachers were supportive and one even donated. But in my last lesson my PE teachers were concerned and took photos to send to the head of house.

'The next day my tutor was told that I had to go to isolation. I tried to explain that it was for charity. 

'I am very upset and disappointed as I am being punished for doing charity fund raising.

'I have had my break and lunch time taken away to be sat behind a computer screen in a small box like room.

'I am starting to regret shaving my head because the days feel like weeks, it feels like a prison.' 

The uniform policy at the school - rated 'outstanding' by Ofsted - states: 'Very short hair or hair with designs cut in will be considered 'extreme'.

'Children who have extreme hairstyles will be isolated.'

Stan says some teachers from Churchill Academy (pictured) even donated money to his charity page on JustGiving before he was told his hairstyle was against uniform rules and barred from the classroom

Headteacher Dr Barry Wratten said: ‘I do not favour speaking publicly about individual students or their families and will not do so now. 

'Churchill Academy and Sixth Form have held a firm line against those who decide to flout our behaviour policies for many years - it is only by doing this can we uphold our standards and make sure we are fair to all.

'This incident isn’t the first and won’t be the last of this nature. 

'In the past parents have approached us about stunts to raise money for charity and we have been able to advise and work with them to avoid any difficulty. 

'At times, some parents do not do this and do not advise their children of potential problems.

'Isolation is one of the consequences for students that break our behaviour policies. 

'My stance is to review when someone is able to take their place again in the mainstream of our learning community – this I will do in these circumstances and this will be based on discussions with the student.

'Speaking generally, there are many ways to raise money for charity - most we will support; rushing into a particular way without thought is always likely to cause consequences. 

'Some people wish to avoid consequences by blaming others - I think this sends a poor message to young people.

' I have consistently held this stance and parents, generally, know we set high standards. That's why we expect them to have a dialogue with us before they allow their child to do something they may regret.' 

Stan's fundraising increased ten-fold within an hour of his story becoming public today and by 3pm his fundraising has soared to almost 40 times his original target, reaching £3,823.19, with donations still flooding in.

The teenager was hoping to raise a modest £100 from his head shave.

He was also swamped by messages from well-wishers who supported his decision to shave his head and criticised the school for putting him in isolation.

One wrote: 'Just read about your exclusion from school and wanted to say that you're a very inspirational young man and stay strong in your beliefs as you go through life Stan. Take care x'

Another added: 'Well done young Sir Stan - very courageous and admirable with a big heart.

'Your school teacher can learn to grow up following your example. Do not be bullied into not following your heart by anyone.' 

Anyone wishing to donate to Stan's cause should visit his JustGiving page.

Last January pupils staged a protest at a Redcar Academy in North Yorkshire amid claims a teenager who shaved her head to raise money for charity after her best friend died of cancer was banned from lessons.

Mia Flood, then 14, was devastated when friend Georgina Anderson, 15, died after a battle with cancer.

She promised her friend before she died that she would shave her head and donate the hair to the Little Princesses Trust - a charity which makes wigs for other young cancer patients. 

She planned to donate money raised from the charity head shave to the Teenage Cancer Trust, as a thank you for helping Georgina's family throughout her ordeal.

Mia's mother ordered a wig but until it arrived her daughter was forced to be schooled at home.

A statement released by the academy and Mia's family said that it had been agreed that arrangements for Mia's education would be made if she went ahead with the shave.

In July 2013 MailOnline reported three 12-year-olds who raised £800 for Cancer Research UK by each shaving half their hair off were taken out of classes and allegedly told 'it's pathetic way to raise money'.

Kiera Thomas, Gemma Wright and Macey Daden decided to adopt the unusual hairstyles, with the breast cancer ribbon shaved onto the side of their heads, in order to battle cancer after losing loved ones to the disease.

They raised £800 for Cancer Research UK, with some of their teachers at St Leonards Academy in St Leonards on Sea, Sussex, among the generous donors who sponsored the girls.

However, they were hauled before the head of Year Seven and told off for their appearance, while Kiera was put in isolation from her classmates because of her haircut.

Jenny Jones, principal of St Leonards Academy, said: 'While we applaud these girls for their efforts in raising money for charity, we have rules and regulations regarding dress and appearance which apply to all our students.'

In April last year 15-year-old Jess Vine, from the Isle of Wight, cut her long hair, which came to below her waist, to fundraise for Cancer Research UK after her grandfather lost his battle with the illness last year.

But she was then told by her school, Ryde Academy, she could not attend classes unless she wore a wig. 

Ryde Academy confirmed Jess had to wear the wig as part of uniform policy.
