Netflix is expanding its empire of original content with a talk show to be hosted by Chelsea Handler.

After months of negotiations and speculation, the streaming service has announced a deal with the comedian that includes a talk show, to launch in early 2016.

The online TV network said it will update the format of her current E! talk show, Chelsea Lately, but retain the comedic focus on entertainment and cultural issues.

Handler will end the seven-year run of Chelsea Lately on August 26.

In demand: Chelsea Handler has lined up her next TV gig - a talk show on Netflix. After months of negotiations and speculation, the show will launch in early 2016

Handler's Netflix show will feature her unfiltered opinions on topics of the day as well as guest interviews.

It has not been determined yet what  frequency the show will be released with — daily, weekly or in-between — with Netflix only noting that it will debut simultaneously in all Netflix territories.

'The Internet has disrupted many of the conventions of traditional television and together with Chelsea Handler, Netflix is looking forward to reimagining the late night talk show for the on-demand generation, starting with the late night part….' said Netflix Chief Content Officer Ted Sarandos.

He added, 'Chelsea has built a huge following on tour, on nightly TV and through her bestselling books, and we can’t wait to introduce her breathtakingly honest and irreverent voice to our global membership.'

In Handler’s now infamous Howard Stern Show radio interview in March, in which she called E! 'a sad, sad place to live' and 'a failure,'  Handler suggested that after she leaves the cable network she would be interested in going to an outlet like Netflix.

'If I was going to continue working in this industry, I knew I had to do something outside the box to keep myself interested,' Handler said.

'I wanted to sit with the cool kids at lunch so I approached Netflix to make sure they were as cool as I thought they were, and when I confirmed my suspicions, like with any other future lover, I made my move.

I’m more excited than I’ve been in awhile, and the team at Netflix is the most forward thinking, alert group I’ve sat down with in ages. No offense to the Shahs Of Sunset.'

In an exclusive interview with MailOnline earlier this month,  the statuesque blonde, 39, said: 'To be quite honest I don't really care about Justin Bieber and I don't want to talk about him anymore. In order to make that happen I had to just stop doing my show. Straight away.

Despite being in a Hollywood clique - and highly protective of friends who include A listers Jennifer Aniston, Cameron Diaz and Reese Witherspoon - Chelsea said she was exhausted of being made to cover the shenanigans that surround the Kardashians.

Even though she is on the same network as Keeping Up With The Kardashians - and Khloe stood in for her while she was away in April - she said: 'I think if you participate in the celebrity world then you don't really have a choice but to be involved in the drama.

Moving on: Chelsea Handler says that after seven years of taunting celebrities, she's over it- saying: 'I don't care about Justin Bieber and I don't want to talk about him anymore'

'You end up getting so into the mix that it changes the topics of the day. You can sit around and complain about all that s**t and the Kardashians all day but if you're participating in it then what can you do? It really didn't feel great doing the show and the only way to sort things out was to extricate myself from the entire situation.'

Currently on tour with a show based on her New York Times bestseller Uganda Be Kidding Me, Chelsea plans to take some well deserved R&R when the tour finishes.

She has plans to travel around Europe, Asia 'and where ever the wind blows me...then it will be time to start up a new kind of show.'

She said: 'Now I want to do things differently. I want to talk to people who are going to educate me. Politicians, medical professionals and people with real human interest stories.

'I want to talk to people who have changed the course of the world. Inventors, invaders and people who have been doing exciting stuff.'

Change of pace: The chat show host, who will bid farewell to her E! show Chelsea Lately in August, admits she is quitting because she is totally fed up of stars

E! told Variety the last month of Chelsea Lately would feature special guests and special episodes. And as ever Chelsea had a sense of humour as she announced the end of the show, saying: 'I myself am more surprised than anyone that I was able to hold down a job for seven years, and it was a fantastic seven years.

'I will always look back at my time on E! as most people look back at their time in college. I’m glad I went.'

The Netflix deal with Handler begins with a standup performance premiering on October 10. She will also create four specials debuting in 2015.

In addition, next year Handler will create four new docu-comedy specials exclusively for Netflix covering her exploration of subjects including politics, NASCAR, the NBA draft and Silicon Valley.

Handler is producing the standup special, docu-comedy specials and new talk show along with her partners in Borderline Amazing, Tom Brunelle and Brad Wollack.

Handler's announced departure from E! had earlier sparked speculation that she might find a late-night home on a broadcast network.

Netflix has already scored with original scripted series including House of Cards.
