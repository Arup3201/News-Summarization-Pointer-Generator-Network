As one of the country’s most influential pollsters he is used to revealing what people are really thinking.

But billionaire Lord Ashcroft definitely gave away too much personal information with an alarming tweet to thousands of his followers.

Revealing personal experience of a unique nocturnal hazard, the former Tory party donor warned against the dangers of taking sleeping pills and laxatives at the same time.

Wise words: The Tory peer revealed his nocturnal woes on Twitter this morning

The Conservative peer’s Twitter feed is usually home to observations on the political battleground and the latest opinion polls.

But early this morning he stunned his 8,000 followers with a tweet stating: ‘Never, under any circumstances, take a sleeping pill and a laxative on the same night.’

While no doubt sage advice, there was immediate speculation that the businessman's account had been hacked.

But it is understood the message was a reflection on the unpleasant results of the man himself mixing medication.

Experience: The wealthy businessman has amassed a fortune of £1.2billion, and has turned from funding to the Tory party to investing in political opinion polls

Posted at 06.59am, it seems the former deputy chairman of the Tory was keen to tell the world of his overnight troubles.

‘At least he’s got the money for the laundry bills,’ one friend said.

When one person on Twitter responded 'oh lordy', Lord Ashcroft replied: 'What can I say...'

Seemingly unperturbed, he quickly announced plans to release the results of a 'detailed poll on the marginal seats' which will be released on Sunday.
