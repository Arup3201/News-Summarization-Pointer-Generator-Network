A small neighborhood in California have been left anxious and on high alert for an extremely dangerous snake that was let loose in the area.

Authorities in Thousand Oaks say they became aware of the exotic animal after one resident, Norma Stull, reported seeing the snake attack her dog.

The incident occurred on the 300 block of Rancho Lane on Monday night.

Mrs Stull's daughter managed to get a photo of the snake, which has now been identified as an albino monocled cobra.

Although he was not bitten, Tiko was rushed to animal hospital with injuries stemming from the attack but has since recovered

Search: L.A. County Animal Control officers have been scouring the neighborhood since Monday in search of the snake

The dog, named Tiko, was taken to an animal hospital in a critical condition with injuries sustained when he tried to escape the attack.

L.A. County Animal Control officers have been scouring the neighborhood since in search of the snake.

At least five officers were on hand looking in bushes and shrubbery on Wednesday, according to ABC 7.

Jules Sylvester, a professional snake wrangler, was also called in by authorities to appease locals.

However Mr Sylvester said it would be hard to locate the cobra.

'It's mostly terrestrials, they stand on the ground,' he told ABC 7.

'But you wouldn't want to surprise it.'

Residents of the leafy suburb have been warned to keep an eye on their children and be careful in areas they think a snake could hide

However Mr Sylvester said the search had been aided by one important factor.

'The good thing about it: He's pure white, so he'll glow in the dark, almost.'

Residents have been told to keep a watchful eye on their children and to use common sense when in areas a snake may hide, such as pipes and under logs.

The monocled cobra can be active at any time of day, but officials say it more likely to be seen in cooler times, such as the morning or evening.

Anyone who sees the snake has been asked to contact Los Angeles County Agoura Animal Care Center at (818) 991-0071 or the California Department of Fish and Wildlife at (909) 899-0659.
