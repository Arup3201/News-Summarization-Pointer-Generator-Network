Ryanair is the least popular short-haul airline, finishing bottom of a new league-table - thanks mainly to its many add-on charges, a new survey by consumer magazine Which? reveals today.

The Irish low-fare carrier had an overall satisfaction score of just 34 per cent in a table compiled from Which? members' votes.

Ryanair was 16th and last in the table which was compiled from views of passengers on a home-bound flight in the 12 months to October.

Which? said: ‘We were inundated with comments about Ryanair - many about its extra charges.

This partly accounts for the paltry one-star ratings for baggage allowance, boarding arrangements, seat allocation, and food and drinks.’

By contrast, the most popular short-haul airline was Swiss, with an overall score of 82% and a maximum five-star score on a number of the rating categories.

These included check-in process, baggage allowance, seating allocation and airline staff.Second in the table was Turkish Airlines with a score of 78%, with German carrier Lufthansa third, Aer Lingus fourth and KLM fifth.

Only airlines which received at least 30 responses were considered.

Swiss's results were based on 59 responses, Turkish Airlines on 38, Lufthansa 74 and Aer Lingus 65.

Ryanair's results were based on 563 responses.

In 15th place was Thomas Cook Airlines with a score of 36 per cent, with Thomson Airways 14th on 45 per cent and Monarch 13th with 47 per cent.

Swiss's customers spoke of the staff's ‘politeness and great service’, while Turkish Airlines was the only carrier to get more than three stars in the food and drink category.
