Always happy, always smiling: Ethan Sarkar, 14, died in the Easter Saturday collision

The best friend of a teenager killed with his father in a horrific car crash described the heartbreaking moment his friend stopped texting him.

Ethan Sarkar, 14, and his father Derek
Sarkar, 46, died when their Volkswagen Golf collided head-on with a 
Volvo on the A614 near East Cowick, East Yorkshire, on Saturday.

Ethan's best friend, Connor Meredith, also 14, said
he had been left devastated by news of 'always smiling' Ethan’s death.

Speaking from outside the Sarkar’s 
family home in Sheldon Heath Road, Birmingham, he said: 'He was the best. He was my 
best friend and I loved him,

'I thought the world of him. He was funny 
and popular and he was always hard working.

'He would always cheer you up if you were down and he was always smiling. He would help anyone.

'I came to his house every day to walk
to school with him. I was speaking to him yesterday on BlackBerry 
messenger and then he just didn’t reply.

'I found out later what had 
happened, from his cousin. I am devastated.'

Ethan loved football and water fights and
'made the best hot chocolate', Connor added. He said he believed the 
family had been visiting relatives for a birthday celebration.

The driver of the Volvo, Sheila Stavert-Lee, 70, from Wigginton, near York, was also killed in the crash, and Mr Sarkar’s wife and nine-year-old daughter, who have not been named, sustained critical injuries.

The two survivors are in a serious condition at Leeds General Infirmary.

Humberside Police said Mr Sarkar was driving north over a canal bridge on the A614 with his son in the front passenger seat when their silver Volkswagen collided with Mrs Stavert-Lee’s red Volvo V70.

A force spokeswoman said: 'It appears the Volvo had crossed on to the wrong side of the carriageway into the path of the oncoming Golf.'

The father and son were pronounced dead at the scene along with Mrs Stavert-Lee. Mr Sarkar’s wife and daughter were airlifted to Leeds.

Locals complain the stretch of road is a death trap and the scene of regular accidents

John Allen, Principal at King Edward VI Sheldon Heath Academy, where Ethan attended, today paid tribute to a 'kind and gentle' young man.

He said: 'I picked up the tragic news from the TV when the police released the names. I was absolutely stunned, devastated is the word.

'It just seems unfair. Ethan was a very kind and gentle young man. Nobody had a bad word to say about him.

'He was always very positive. He had lots and lots of friends and teachers were very positive about him.

'He was never in trouble, he was just a really nice guy.'With him being such a good student, I didn't know his parents well but our paths crossed.

'They would come to parents evenings and they were always very supportive of the academy and very supportive of their son.

'They were a good solid family, nice people. It's just devastating.'

A Facebook tribute group was set up on
Sunday and poignant messages of sympathy and support flooded into the 
social networking page.

Wreckage: A badly damaged car at the scene of the crash in which three people were killed

Debbie Hinchliffe, who lives a short 
distance from the bridge where the two cars collided, told how she ran 
to the wreckage to hear the sound of children screaming.

Mrs Hinchliffe was the first person at the scene of the crash, which happened at about 1.30pm.

She said she found Mrs Stavert-Lee 
unconscious in the Volvo, which had smoke pouring from its front and 
appeared to be about to set on fire.

Mrs Hinchliffe said she wanted to talk
about the horrific scene she witnessed in the hope something is done 
about the road outside her house which has seen a catalogue of crashes.

'It was a shock - the severity of it,' she said.

'I was stood at my gate and I heard the crash. I ran to the scene. Two cars were written off.'

Mrs Hinchliffe said the Golf had two people in the front who were obviously dead.

She said Mrs Stavert-Lee’s daughter was following her mother in another car and came across the scene.

They were travelling to Doncaster from the York area, she believed.

Both drivers and a 14-year-old passengers were killed when these two cars collided in Goole, Yorkshire, yesterday

Mrs Hinchliffe said she tried to get into the back of the Volkswagen where she thought children were trapped.

She said other people began to arrive and managed to free the occupants.

But she said her main concern was to get the unconscious Volvo driver out as smoke poured from the engine compartment.

Her husband even went to bring a bucket of water to douse the car and they eventually managed to bring her out of the vehicle. Mrs Hinchliffe said she took the pensioner’s daughter to her house and police arrived later to inform them she had died.

Mrs Hinchliffe said she had lived in her home for eight years and had seen many accidents on the stretch of road in that time.

She said: 'There’s accidents every other week. We want speed cameras. You take your life in your hands every time you pull out. With three deaths, maybe something will get done. I don’t know.

'I’ve had people laid out on my lawn, I’ve had cars through my plum trees into my garden.

'How many accidents and deaths is it going to take before they do something? We have to live with this on a daily basis. It’s horrendous.'

Two passengers were taken by the helicopters to Leeds General Infirmary. Officers said they had serious 'life-threatening' injuries

Yesterday, a single bunch of flowers was laid on the bridge over the Aire and Calder Navigation canal, where the crash happened.

The incident provoked a huge emergency
services response with two air ambulances, three land ambulances and 
two rapid response paramedic units joining firefighters and police at 
the remote scene.

The investigation and clear-up operation took more than seven hours.

Humberside Police have appealed for motorists who were driving on the A614 at the time to come forward.

A Facebook page for Mr Sarkar says he went to Kings Heath Boys School in Birmingham.

On the page, which is crammed with 
family photographs, his activities include badminton, books, music and 
'peace and quiet', and he jokes that his political affiliation is the 
Monster Raving Loony Party.
