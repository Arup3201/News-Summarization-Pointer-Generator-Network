Manchester City winger Scott Sinclair has returned to the club for pre-season training after enjoying a romantic break with his model girlfriend Helen Flanagan.

The 25-year-old's future in Manchester looks bleak after he was sent on loan to West Brom last season and featured just eight times for the Baggies in the Premier League.

Sinclair, who will be hoping to get his promising career back on track this summer, began the process by joining up with manager Manuel Pellegrini and selection of City stars for his first session after a summer break.

The former Swansea star joined the likes of Gael Clichy, Stevan Jovetic and Aleksandar Kolarov for training at Carrington as Pellegrini put some of his players through their paces ahead of the new season.

Sinclair has just returned from a trip to Mexico with his long-term partner Flanagan, who formerly appeared as Rosie Webster on hit ITV soap Coronation Street.

The pair were pictured frolicking in the sea and holding hands on the beach before returning home in order for Sinclair to get back to business.

Sinclair and Flanagan were also pictured in Manchester city centre on Monday, where it is believed they are staying in a hotel after selling their house in the area.
