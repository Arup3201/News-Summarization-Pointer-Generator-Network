A woman whose fiance was killed in a motorcycle crash has extracted his sperm to fulfill their dream of having a baby, after strangers donated to pay for the procedure.

Cameron Robinett, of Tucson, Arizona, was desperate to be a father.

But last Friday, while house hunting in California, the 25-year-old motorcyclist crashed. Three days later he died in hospital.

Devastated, Stephanie Lucas, 22, had just a small window of opportunity to extract sperm from her partner to hold on to the couple's dream of becoming parents.

Last Friday, while house hunting in California, 25-year-old Mr Robinett crashed. Three days later he died in hospital leaving Miss Lucas devastated

Immediately she went online and urgently pleaded for funds to pay for the procedure.

Touched by her appeal, strangers raised more than $11,000 (£7,000) in just one day - with several anonymous donations of $1,000 and $2,000. 

'We were so excited about having a family,' Miss Lucas told MailOnline.

'Cameron was particularly excited. He said: "We don't need to be married to have a family. Let's start one now".

'He really wanted to be a daddy, so I'm just fulfilling his dream.'

Mr Robinett had been viewing houses in California, where the couple planned to move to, when the accident happened on Friday.  

He was badly injured and passed away in Eden Hospital on Monday.

'He loved his motorcycle,' Miss Lucas recalled. 'I didn't mind him riding it. I knew he loved it, although I always told him to be careful. 

'He was an adventurer. He was eccentric with a huge, open heart. He would give you the shirt off his back. I want to pass that onto our baby. We are so thankful to god we had time with him.'

She said the procedure to extract the sperm cost around £5,600 ($9,000) and it will be kept in cold storage for up to a year.

'When I found out Cameron died, I was heartbroken,' she said. 'But I realised immediately I wanted to have his baby and I knew that I didn't have long. 

Miss Lucas, 22, had just a small window of opportunity to extract sperm from her partner to hold on to the couple's dream of becoming parents. Immediately she went online to plead for help to afford the procedure

Touched by her appeal, strangers raised more than $11,000 (£7,000) in just one day - with several anonymous donations of $1,000 and $2,000

'Within hours I went online and pleaded for help on Go Fund Me. It was quick but the only way to do it.'

Her message on the site, read: 'My fiance Cameron was in a motorcycle accident on Friday and was declared brain dead today. 

'We wanted children very much and my family and his family and I have all decided we'd love to still make this happen.

'This baby would be truly loved and surrounded by an amazing family.

'Unfortunately the cost to extract the sperm is $6,000 that must be paid upfront by tomorrow evening, an amount we won't be able to come up with on our own.

'In lieu of flowers or gifts to honour Cameron, we're asking you to make a donation to actually bring a part of Cameron, the amazing, handsome, silly, guy that I loved with my whole heart, back to life.'  

Miss Lucas said she doesn't yet know when she'll implant it.

'The grief is very raw at the moment but I want his baby, our baby,' she said.

She said a visit to where Mr Robinett was staying in California yesterday reinforced her decision to go through with the sperm extraction.

After visiting the funeral home to pick up Mr Robinett's urn, Miss Lucas and his family visited the crash site and his home in California.

Miss Lucas, said: 'We started to go through his clothes and found that each of his favourite things brought back a memory that made us laugh or smile.

'After all the stories were shared and laundry was sorted, we were about to leave and Cameron's mum said, "one more look".

'We tried to convince her otherwise but she was determined. And we are so glad, because buried in Cameron's laundry was a jersey, a Seahawks jersey. 

Miss Lucas said: 'I will never be able to say it enough - thank you for your support. It is everything'

Miss Lucas said she does not know when she will have the sperm implanted, but said she knows Mr Robinett, who was desperate to become a father, will be looking down on her and their baby

'But not just any jersey, a Marshawn Lynch jersey in size 0-3 months. Something we bought last Christmas for our future baby.

'Cameron only brought a few things with him to California, and one of the things he brought was this jersey.

'Our jaws dropped and then we all smiled and looked up to the heavens to say - "we hear you Cameron", and everyone has come together to make this happen.

'I will never be able to say it enough - thank you for your support. It is everything.'  

She told how she met Cameron, who ran Sweet Garlic Company, in 2011 through work, becoming engaged in December 2012.

Now she has the support of her family including mother Debbie and Cameron's mother Loretta, to have their baby.

'I wasn't sure how our mums would feel but they were really supportive,' she said. 'I am beyond grateful for people's help. 

'I was feeling so defeated when I found out the procedure would be so expensive and the money had to be paid upfront.

'I had lost not just my fiancé and my future, but my future family too.

'I've now been given the gift of a future. I think Cameron will be looking down on us.' 

A Fremont Police spokeswoman said: 'The motorcyclist collided with the garage of a residence. The motorcyclist was transported to a trauma center with life threatening injuries.'
