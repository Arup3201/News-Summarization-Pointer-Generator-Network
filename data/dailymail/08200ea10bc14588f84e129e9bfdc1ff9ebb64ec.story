Patients are having to wait five and a half hours in ambulances parked outside A&E because there are not enough beds.

Some relatives are arriving at hospital to visit their loved ones only to find they are still ‘queued up’ outside the main entrance.

Last week some 4,500 patients waited in ambulances for at least half an hour before they were admitted.

Since the beginning of November there have been more than 68,000 such cases, a rise of a third compared to the same period last year.

Figures obtained by Labour show that one patient brought in by Great Western Ambulance Trust in the last two months was made to wait 5 hours and 42 minutes.

Another taken to hospital by West Midlands Ambulance Trust waited five hours and five minutes.

Warning: Shadow Health Secretary Andy Burnham said: 'These chaotic scenes in A&E take us straight back to the bad old days of the mid-1990s'

But there is concern that keeping ambulances outside hospitals for so long puts other patients waiting for help at risk.

One unnamed paramedic, who works in Hertfordshire said: ‘Someone will die this winter as a result of no ambulance being available at the time of the emergency. It is not a matter of if, but when.’

Shadow Health Secretary Andy Burnham said: ‘These chaotic scenes in A&E take us straight back to the bad old days of the mid-1990s.

‘Up and down the country, ambulances are unable to dispatch patients, hospitals are full to bursting and people are waiting on trolleys in corridors.

‘The Government must take urgent action to ensure all A&Es have enough staff to provide safe standards of patient care and meet national standards.’

Another unnamed paramedic, who works in North East England said: ‘Families of sick people arrive at hospitals and expect to find them in a bed, but they are still outside in an ambulance. The frustration of ambulance staff is beyond belief’

Many emergency departments have become increasingly overstretched over the last few years and at times they are just too busy to admit new patients.

But there is also concern that staff are deliberately making patients wait outside so they can meet targets and avoid fines.

The rules state that hospitals ensure that at least 95 per cent of patients spend no more than four hours in A&E before they are discharged or taken to other wards.

Yet the clock only starts once patients are admitted, so managers will be inclined to leave them outside when they are very busy.

Katherine Murphy, chief executive of the Patients Association, said: ‘The public will be deeply concerned by these figures, and deserve to expect the quickest access to A&E possible.

‘Long periods of waiting in an ambulance clearly adds to the stress and discomfort patients are already experiencing.

‘The Government needs to act to address the severe service pressures that lead to these unacceptable bottlenecks.’

NHS figures show that the number of emergency admissions has risen by 8 per cent in a year to 17.6 million.

This rise has partly been blamed on the failure of GP out-of-hours services as well as the increasing elderly population.

Meanwhile officials are considering renaming A&E units either ‘999’ or ‘111’ departments.

A report from NHS Commissioning Board recommends that all emergency departments are classified into treating either emergency cases or just urgent.

Those responsible for emergency care would be known as 999 units, while those looking after urgent cases would be 111 centres.

A Department of Health spokesman said: ‘The NHS is seeing an extra one million more patients in A&E compared to two years ago and despite the additional pressure overall it is coping well.’
