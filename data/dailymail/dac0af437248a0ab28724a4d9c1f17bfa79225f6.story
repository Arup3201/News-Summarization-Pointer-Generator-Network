Four people including a nine-year-old girl were killed in Lebanon's northern city of Tripoli today as gunmen exchanged fire, deepening a political crisis following the assassination of a senior intelligence official.

Twelve people were also wounded in the incident, while in southern Beirut five people were wounded in fighting between Lebanese troops and gunmen.

The violence has heightened fears that the civil war in neighbouring Syria could be spreading into Lebanon, upsetting its delicate political balance and threatening to usher in a new era of sectarian bloodshed.

Lebanon has been boiling over since Friday after Brigadier General Wissam al-Hassan, an intelligence chief opposed to the Syrian leadership, was assassinated in a car bombing.

Many politicians have accused Syria of being behind the killing and angry protesters tried to storm the government palace after Hassan's funeral yesterday.

Opposition leaders and their supporters want Prime Minister Najib Mikati to resign, saying he is too close to Syrian President Bashar al-Assad and his Lebanese militant ally Hezbollah, which is part of Mikati's government.

Today's clashes in Beirut took place on the edge of Tariq al-Jadida, a Sunni Muslim district that neighbours Shi'ite Muslim suburbs in the south of the capital.

Residents had earlier reported heavy overnight gunfire around Tariq al-Jadida between gunmen armed with rifles and rocket-propelled grenades.

In Tripoli, a nine-year-old girl shot by a sniper was one of three people killed in overnight clashes. Nine people were wounded, medical and security sources said.

The sources said the two dead men were from the Sunni Muslim district of Bab al-Tabbaneh and were killed after gunmen there exchanged rocket and gunfire with the mainly Alawite neighbourhood of Jebel Mohsen.

In a later incident this morning, a 
woman was killed and three people wounded by gunfire in the Alawite 
district. Tripoli has frequently been hit by clashes between Sunnis and 
Alawites sympathetic to different sides in the Syria war.

Thousands
of people had turned out in Beirut's downtown Martyrs' Square for 
Hassan's funeral on Sunday but that ended in violence, with security 
forces firing tear gas and shots in the air as hundreds tried to storm 
the prime minister's office.

Protesters overnight blocked roads in Beirut with burning tyres, including the highway to the airport.

The
capital was noticeably quieter than normal today. Many people stayed 
home for fear of violence and streets were free of the usual traffic 
chaos. Memories are still vivid here of the death and destruction of 
Lebanon's 1975-90 civil war.

Heavily-armed soldiers and police were out in force at street junctions and government buildings.

Opposition leaders have urged their supporters to refrain from any more violence.

Former
prime minister Saad al-Hariri said on the Future Television channel 
last night: 'We want peace, the government should fall, but we want that
in a peaceful way. I call on all those who are in the streets to pull 
back.'

The crisis in 
Lebanon underscores local and international concern that the 
19-month-old uprising against Assad is dragging in Syria's neighbours.

Sunni-led rebels are fighting to 
overthrow Assad, who is from the Alawite minority that has its roots in 
Shi'ite Islam. Lebanon's religious communities are divided between those
that support Assad and those that back the rebels.

Hassan,
47, was a senior intelligence official who had helped uncover a bomb 
plot that led to the arrest and indictment in August of a pro-Assad 
former Lebanese minister.

A
Sunni Muslim, he also led an investigation that implicated Syria and 
the Shi'ite Hezbollah in the 2005 assassination of Rafik al-Hariri, a 
former prime minister of Lebanon.

Damascus and Hezbollah have condemned Hassan's killing.

Mikati
said on Saturday he had offered to resign to make way for a government 
of national unity, but that he had accepted a request by President 
Michel Suleiman to stay in office to allow time for talks on a way out 
of the political crisis.

Ambassadors
from Britain, the U.S., China, Russia and France met Suleiman today and
appealed to Lebanese leaders to resolve the crisis peacefully.

Derek
Plumbly, the UN Special Coordinator for Lebanon, who also attended the 
talks, said the group condemned 'any attempt to destabilise Lebanon 
through political assassination' and called on all parties in the 
country to preserve national unity.

They expressed support for Suleiman's efforts to start a dialogue among politicians to resolve the crisis.
