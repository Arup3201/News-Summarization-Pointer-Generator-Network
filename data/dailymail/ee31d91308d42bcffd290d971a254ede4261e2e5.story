Remy heads list of Atletico targets as Champions League semi-finalists chase Lukaku, Hernandez and Soldado

Chelsea have joined the race for Everton defender John Stones but will face a difficult task prising him away.

Arsenal also have an interest in the 19-year-old, who is being tipped as an outsider for Roy Hodgson's World Cup training squad.

Stones was bought from Barnsley by David Moyes in January 2013 for a £3million fee, heading off interest from then-Wigan manager Roberto Martinez and Sir Alex Ferguson at Manchester United.

Although he was playing as a right back, Moyes and Martinez recognised Stones would become a centre back and he is showing how in his performances of late.

Arsenal have watched the England U21 defender closely and like his ability to bring the ball out of defence which has come to the fore this season.

In demand: Young Everton defender John Stones is wanted by both London giants, Chelsea and Arsenal

Chelsea have good youth players coming through but Stones is ahead of them after gaining Premier League experience.

Both clubs would like to make an offer but Everton are not looking to sell any of their stars as they continue to make giant strides towards Champions League qualification.

Whereas in the past they would be vulnerable to any sizeable bid, the club is utilising increased TV money to stabilise and build for the future.

Ross Barkley is also inevitably wanted by Premier League rivals but Everton believe the player wants to stay at Goodison for at least another two years before taking stock of where to take his career.

By that time they hope to have added more than Champions League qualification to convince him to stay.

Staying put: Everton are confident the much-coveted Ross Barkley intends to stay at Goodison for a while yet

Leicester City scouts are due in Argentina this week to watch Luciano Vietto.

The 20-year-old forward, valued at £6miilion, is due to play for Racing Club against Gimnasia La Plata.

Leicester are ready to bring in around four new players ahead of their Premier League campaign with a right back and goalkeeper also on their wishlist.

Manager Nigel Pearson is keen on Feyenoord's 24-year-old Daryl Janmaat. The Holland defender has rejected new terms at his club and is poised to move to England, although Arsenal have also watched him in recent months.

Prospect: Leicester are planning for life in the Premier League with signings such as Luciano Vietto (centre)

Liverpool, Arsenal and Everton scouts were all present at PSV Eindhoven's 2-0 home defeat to Feyenoord on Sunday.

The game was far from spectacular by all accounts with Feyenoord defenders Joris Mathijsen and Daryl Janmaat on the scoresheet.

Everton and Liverpool though have been particularly keen on other Feyenoord defenders Bruno Martins Indi and Stefan de Vrij. Both are expected to be sold this summer.

Stoke City have resumed talks over potential deals for Wolfsburg's Ivica Olic and Mame Biram Diouf of Hannover but look likely to miss out on Olic in particular with his wage demands too high.

Olic, 34, has stated this weekend that he is ready to stay at Wolfsburg and that may not be too surprising with his salary at around £75,000 a week and the Germans will offer two years.

Diouf is understood to be looking for similar terms to leave Germany for the Premier League after turning down a new contract at Hannover.

Bundesliga targets: Stoke are hoping to bring in both Wolfsburg's Ivica Olic and Hannover's Mame Biram Diouf

Both players are out of contract and free to talk to interested clubs abroad.

Croat
 Olic, who has scored 12 goals in 28 matches for Wolfsburg this season, 
told Kicker-Sportmagazin: 'My thought is to stay on at Wolfsburg. I am 
expecting to remain at Volkswagen-Arena and be a part of this squad also
 in the new Bundesliga 1 season.'

Diouf, 26, has interest also from Cardiff City, West Ham and Hamburg - although the latter are struggling financially.

Southampton are looking for new takers for Pablo Osvaldo after Juventus indicated he would be returning to St Mary's in the summer.

Juve coach Antonio Conte said: 'I can only speak highly of Osvaldo because he works hard and settled into the group well. He will give us a hand from here to the end of the season so we can achieve our objectives.'

Southampton had agreed a loan with view to a permanent £15.6million deal but will now be looking to see if there is interest from Spain and other Italian clubs once he returns in the summer.

Unwanted: Southampton are desperate to get rid of Pablo Osvaldo, whose loan at Juventus is soon ending

Saints will be looking for new forwards to replace Osvaldo and possibly others.

Tottenham
 and Arsenal are both keen on Jay Rodriguez although his knee injury may
 ensure he stays another season while Tottenham remain interested in a 
deal for Adam Lallana also. However, Manchester United are 
unlikely to pursue a deal for the England midfielder at this stage.

Gaston Ramirez is also expected to return to Serie A.

Wigan are the latest club to show a firm interest in Sheffield United centre back Harry Maguire.

Manager Uwe Rosler has had scouts check on the 21-year-old, who has also been monitored by Liverpool and Arsenal this season.

Rosler also wants a right back with Maguire's team-mate John Brayford a possibility. Rosler had wanted to strike a deal for Red Bull Salzburg's Florin Klein but the 27-year-old looks destined to sign for Stuttgart instead.
