Sneeky: Divorcee Paul Lapping (pictured) falsely claimed £45,000 in benefits after failing to declare a £125,000 inheritance which he used to pursue a transatlantic romance with a Canadian woman

A benefits cheat paid for his transatlantic love life after fiddling more than £45,000 in handouts - and blew thousands on exotic holidays, a court heard today.

Paul Lapping, 53, falsely claimed state benefits as he jetted more than four thousands miles to romance a Canadian woman.

The divorcee failed to tell authorities about getting a £125,000 inheritance from his family - and carried on claiming disability benefits as he flew across the Atlantic.

He used the inheritance to buy a $80,000 (£50,000) love shack near Toronto after falling for the Canadian woman.

The court heard Lapping also spent another £17,500 on exotic holidays while claiming income support.

Prosecutor Stuart McLeese said an investigation into Lapping's transatlantic love life was launched after a tip-off from the public.

Mr McLeese said: 'He had bought a property in Canada for $80,000 in 2006.

'Lapping had fallen in love with a woman in Canada and bought a property which he sold in 2011.

'However, he failed to tell the authorities this and the fact that he had received an inheritance of £125,000.

'Lapping was interviewed twice last year and in the first interview said he received £17,500 from the sale of the Canada property.'

The court heard how Lapping and his Canadian girlfriend broke up after less than a year together.

Heartbroken Lapping put their love nest up for sale and moved back to the UK.

He went on to blow both his £125,000 inheritance and the £17,500 he got for the Canadian house on exotic holidays.

Wheelchair-bound Lapping was now getting benefits after spending the windfall cash.

Mr McLeese said the total overpayment in Income Support, housing benefit and Council tax benefit was £45,872.

He said the money was being paid back at a rate of £14.20 a fortnight.

Judge Paul Thomas QC said that if Lapping lived to be 100 he 'may get somewhere to paying it off'.

Lapping pleaded guilty to obtaining benefit by deception and two counts of failing to notify of a change in circumstances.

Ian Wright, mitigating, said Lapping 
was left in a wheelchair after his motorcycle which crashed with a car 
more than 30 years ago.

Judge Thomas said Lapping was 'motivated by pure greed'.

He said: 'The country can ill afford it had lost out to the sum of more than £45,000.'

Lapping was sentenced to 20 months imprisonment suspended for two years.

Judge Thomas also ordered he do 300 
hours of unpaid work and told him: 'You have taken away from society and
you should make as big a contribution back as I can order.'

Lapping lives in a semi-detached, downstairs flat in the West Cross area of Swansea, near the popular holiday resort of Mumbles.

Speaking after the case, neighbour 
Ann Evans said: 'We all knew he had a lot of money from his inheritance 
and that it kept him ticking over.

'I can't believe he was claiming benefits on top of that - it really does take the mick.'

Lapping's red brick property has a satellite TV dish and CCTV cameras fixed to the side.

Ann, who has lived in the area for 10 years, added: 'He moved in a couple of years ago but we have never got on.

'I don't think he's a very nice person, I've always thought he was trouble with a capital T.

'He's always seemed untrustworthy, like he was up to something, and now we know what.'
