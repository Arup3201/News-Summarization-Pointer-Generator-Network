This hilarious video shows the moment a baby deer stumbled into a house after getting separated from its mother.

The fawn, which was later reunited with its mum, is caught on camera slipping and sliding around a laminate-floored home in Halifax, Nova Scotia, Canada.

The adorable 'little Bambi' was seen by 11-year-old Cameron Harrington, who filmed it playing around in a bush in his front garden before it ventured inside.

Oh deer! The fawn slips on to its face as it tries to work out how to walk inside the house

The deer, which had got separated from its mother, laid down under a desk after it all got a bit too much

As Cameron was greeting a friend at his door, they saw the fawn behind a bush outside the home.

The boy grabbed his iPad and began filming the deer, who could not resist poking his head through the open front door.

As the boys follow the deer it dashes inside.

Cameron shouts for help from his father, saying: 'Dad, there's a fricking deer in our house! A baby deer's in our house.'

Cameron's father, Colin Harrington, 43, was on a conference call when the boys scrambled through the house recording the deer.

The spooked fawn stopped running and hid under a desk - where Colin was able to scoop him up and calm him down.

Once he was able to pick it up, he put it back outside and the deer bolted into the woods.

The family spotted the fawn the next day, reunited with its mother.

Cameron's mother Julie Harrington, 40, said: 'You can hear Cameron saying "don't go in the house" and as if on cue, the deer ran through the front door.

'The baby deer looked like Bambi on ice - he was really sliding around and couldn't stand on the hardwood floor.

'The boys were freaked out by the noises the deer was making.

'Colin was very concerned and was very conscious about leaving a scent on it - it may have been rejected by its mother.'

The fawn was seen back with its mother and brother and sisters the next day
