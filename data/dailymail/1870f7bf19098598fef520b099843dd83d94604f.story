Udhai Ri's selfie, accompanied by the 'feeling sad' emoji, clearly shows his uncle's corpse in the background

A man has caused a storm on social media after posting  a selfie of himself with his uncle's corpse during a funeral.

Udhai Ri, 34, from Jaffna Town in Sri Lanka, stunned friends and family when he snapped himself standing in front of his dead uncle lying on a funeral bed.

The photo was then posted onto his Facebook and Twitter accounts.

Accompanying it, using the Tamil translation for uncle, were the words: 'My peiriya appa passed away.'

This was followed by a 'sad face' emoji and the words 'feeling sad'.

But he was soon turned on by shocked online users.

Facebook user Dinesh Devi posted: 'Oh, man! Really? This is disgusting. Show some respect.'

Som Gamage wrote: 'What is this? A Deady? Could you sink any lower?'

Nalin Kodikara added: 'I've never seen anything as disgustingly poor taste as this.'

Mr Ri soon took the photo down but not before it had begun doing the rounds on social media.

A friend of Mr Ri's said: 'He was very upset and wanted to express that and share his grief and final moments with his uncle with his friends.

'Being upset he wasn't thinking clearly though, as this was obviously a bad idea, to say the least.

'He apologises for any offence he has caused.'

Although there's no doubt the selfie has become a bona fide cultural phenomenon, popularized perhaps most famously by Kim Kardashian, there remain some limits to its acceptability.Â 

Among the people to have gained notoriety are a man who took a photo of himself in front of his dead grandmother's casket, those smiling cheerily at the scene of the Sydney siege in December and people taking pictures of themselves before sometimes fatal accidents.
