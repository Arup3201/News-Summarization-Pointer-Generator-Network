Tony Blair faced angry street protests in Thailand yesterday after jetting in to advise the country on peace and reconciliation.

The former prime minister was heckled after local news reports claimed he was being paid more than £400,000 to speak at a one-day conference in Bangkok.

Protesters carried banners saying ‘Blair ruined the UK, stay out of Thailand’, and ‘Blair speaks,  Thailand pays’.

Protestors storm the streets of Bangkok after claims emerged last week Tony Blair was to be paid £400,000 to speak at the peace forum convened by the Thai government

Protesters in Bangkok fought against Blair's decision to take part in the forum held in the name of peace negotiation

The UK Foreign Office released a statement ahead of the planned protest on August 27 advising tourists to avoid the British Embassy in Bangkok

Mr Blair, a Middle East peace envoy, denied receiving a fee for his appearance.

So did the Thai government, who said taxpayers were covering only Mr Blair’s travel, accommodation and expenses.

Mr Blair said: ‘Just for the record, I’m not being paid. I’m here because you invited me.’

He then cracked a joke about wearing a
 blue-coloured tie to avoid association with either of  Thailand’s red 
or yellow-wearing street protest groups. The event was organised in a 
bid to draw a line under years of civil strife that followed a military 
coup in 2006.

But hopes of reconciliation between 
Thailand’s feuding  factions were undermined after key opposition 
figures boycotted  the conference.

Tony Blair spoke at the forum held in Bangkok today which intends to bridge peace and reconciliation negotiations across Thailand

The former prime minister is one of the highest-paid public speakers in the world, once earning £364,000 for two 30 minute speeches in the Philippines

Within hours of Mr Blair’s lecture, Thai newspaper columnists were insisting nothing had been gained by the event.

Mr Blair has faced a backlash in 
Britain for writing a series of  hawkish newspaper articles calling for 
Western intervention in Syria.

The ex-premier, who was pictured last 
week holidaying on the yachts of wealthy friends in the Mediterranean, 
described the decision by the Commons to block military action as 
‘shocking’.

Former Finnish President Martti Ahtisaari appeared at the forum alongside Thai Prime Minister Yingluck Shinawatra and Middle East peace envoy, Tony Blair

Former Tory Cabinet minister David 
Mellor called for a ‘period of silence’ from Mr Blair. Protesters in 
Thailand also held a series of demonstrations against Mr Blair’s visit 
outside the British embassy last week.

They handed in a petition opposing his
 participation in the conference, arranged under the title ‘Uniting for 
the Future: Learning from Each Other’s Experience’. Mr Blair, who helped
 to broker the peace process in Northern Ireland, told the conference 
that the events of the past should be ‘honestly examined’ but never 
judged.

He urged the Thai government to engage opposition voices in the democratic process.

A spokesman for Mr Blair said: 'Mr Blair was not paid for this event – he was there to talk, for free, about reconciliation.

'It was actually a very positive discussion. During his time there he also met with the leader of the opposition.'
