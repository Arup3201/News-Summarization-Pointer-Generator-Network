 It's one childhood experience that few have managed to escape: head over the bath while mum washes in some super-strength head lice potion, followed by hours having the little horrors combed out of the hair. 

But after years of being blasted by special shampoos, nits are now becoming resistant to many of the lotions on offer in supermarkets and pharmacies. 

So mums are turning in their droves to the internet to discover alternative solutions.

Alex Butler regularly uses hair straighteners on her children including Magda (pictured). The mum-of-three finds the kids prefer the tongs as they see it as a treat. She said: "It's a nice change because they aren't allowed to have their hair straightened usually." 

Mum-of-three Alex Butler from Brighton swapped potions for hair irons after it was recommended by a parent at her children's school. 

The 36-year-old now uses the practice on each of her three children, Magda, 11, Pearl, nine, and Camille, six. 

She said: 'I used hair straighteners on my daughter’s hair to pop the eggs and burn the lice, lots of the other mums at school swear by it. 

'I also use the lice shampoo Hedrin, they both work. 

'But with three children, you get them so regularly when they're a certain age. 

'Using the straighteners is a nice change because they aren't allowed to have their hair straightened usually, so it makes it into an enjoyable thing. '

Alexandra Butler (36) is a mother to Magda (11), Pearl (nine) and Camille (six). With so many young children in the house, she finds there are often issues with headlice. She is one of many British parents turning to alternative methods to supplement traditional nit lotions. 

It isn't the only alternative method being used by British parents though; internet forums reveal parents suggesting a range of quick-fix solutions that include using mayonnaise on the scalp or bleaching the hair. 

One in five parents even admit to shaving their child’s hair in an attempt to eliminate head lice. 

With near a quarter of parents turning to the web to search for help in getting rid of the pests, scientists are now  warning people that most new-age solutions will only make the problem worse and can also put children in danger.

Ian Burgess, director of the Medical Entomology Centre said; 'There is a huge amount of incorrect head lice information online, which exists on the more popular sites parents are visiting. 

'This gives worried parents misplaced confidence in ineffective methods. 

'When they follow this advice, head lice are allowed to spread further and quicker. 

'I’ve heard of mums dyeing their child’s hair, in an attempt to kill the lice. 

'They believe this was effective because they can’t find lice, but in fact the lice have just been dyed along with the hair.'

Hedrin lice lotion has now undertaken a comprehensive study of popular forums and social networking sites used by parents of attitudes towards head lice, in an effort to promote the sharing of best practice advice.
