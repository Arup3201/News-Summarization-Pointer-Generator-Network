This video - entitled ‘Papa bought his daughter a Lexus’ - has done nothing to enhance the reputation of women drivers in Russia.

Apparently leaked by an insurance industry source, it shows a spectacular crash as a new owner - perhaps on her first outing with a gleaming black 4x4 - reverses, cautiously, from her parking place.

Abruptly, she speeds up, ramming a bush and sinking into a ditch at the side of the road, flipping the expensive new SUV onto its roof.

Gently does it: The owner of this gleaming new SUV at first slowly and cautiously reverses from the space

Jump: It seems the driver's foot has slipped on the accelerator somewhat, causing the vehicle to jerk back

Oh dear: The car, said to be a brand new Lexus GX460, sinks into an unfortunately located ditch

Disaster: The vehicle rolls over onto its roof. The driver was said to have been saved from harm by the airbags

Youtube user MegaTrover uploaded the 16-second footage stating: 'The video was filmed by CCTV camera. I was given it by a friend who deals with car insurance.

'The Lexus was brand new. They didn’t even take the factory’s protective covers from inside the car.

'The car was driven by a young woman. She wasn’t hurt thanks to the airbags.'

The female driver was not identified, nor was the location in Russia where the accident happened.

The Lexus was believed to be a present from her wealthy father. The vehicle is believed to be a Lexus GX460, retailing at around £38,000 in Russia.

A voice on the video - believed to have been re-recorded from a security camera - says 'No way.....' - as the action unfolds.

Comments to the video - which has gone viral on the Russian web - include such observations as: 'No matter what you’ve got under your bum, Lexus or Lada, you’ve got to keep your brain in gear too.'

Some were laced with sexism about female drivers, such as: 'Women have no place in such vehicles.'

'This indulgent father bought her a luxury motor - but he should have made sure she had a driving licence before she drove it,' said one commenter.

'I think it was extremely lucky that she tested her driving skills in a quiet yard, didn’t injure herself and didn’t get other drivers or pedestrians hurt. Imagine her in the middle of a busy motorway,' said another.

Yet another complained: 'Why oh why are inexperienced drivers like this getting heavy cars like that?'
