Toddler diarrhoea (TD) is a common cause of chronic diarrhoea in children aged between one and five

When her two-year-old son, Tom, developed diarrhoea, Emma Maynard assumed it was a stomach bug.

Tom seemed perfectly well and ate normally, but the problem didn't improve. So four weeks later she took him to the GP and received a diagnosis she'd never heard of - toddler diarrhoea (TD).

This is a common cause of chronic diarrhoea in children aged between one and five, but unlike the type caused by a stomach bug, which tends to last for a few days, it lasts for months or even years.

'The GP was confident Tom had it, but we were sent for tests to be sure there was no other cause, such as an allergy,' says Emma, 36, a web designer from North London.

'But the results all came back clear and we were told that he would eventually grow out of TD.'The condition usually starts around the age of one and resolves itself around the age of four, never to be seen again. The cause is unknown.

'It's extremely common,' says Dr Michael Thomson, a consultant paediatric gastroenterologist at Sheffield Children's Hospital and London's Portland Hospital. 'I see children with it almost every week.

'After taking a thorough clinical history, it is usually obvious when TD is the cause because, despite having several episodes of diarrhoea a day, the child is otherwise completely well and growing normally.

'That's the defining symptom. Most nutrients are absorbed in the top 10 per cent of the gut, so they still get enough.

Many parents come along concerned that it's caused by an allergy or intolerance. Occasionally, I see parents who have tried eliminating numerous food groups unsupervised, which is not advisable because it can make a child ill.

'If there is a history of being atopic (having allergies) in the family or the child has recently had a bout of gastroenteritis, we'd rule out things such as dairy  allergy or intolerance with a two- to four-week elimination diet, followed by reintroducing these foods.

'If it's a food allergy, though, there tends to be blood and mucus in the stools, and this is not present in toddler diarrhoea.'

Another possible cause is coeliac disease - where the body reacts to gluten, a protein found in wheat. 'If this is suspected, we can do a blood test for that,' Dr Thomson says.

While there is no drug treatment for toddler diarrhoea, dietary changes can help.

'The first change is to cut out fruit juices, especially clear apple juice,' says Judy More, a paediatric dietitian. This is hugely popular with children, but, in fact, it's one of the main culprits in toddler diarrhoea. The problem is the fructose it contains, which  is poorly absorbed by some children.

Cutting down on fructose and increasing fat in your toddler's diet could help alleviate symptoms

'If a sugar is not absorbed properly in the upper gut, it goes through to the large bowel unchanged,' says Dr Thomson.

'The bacteria there then digest it and it ferments, causing gas and diarrhoea. For unknown reasons, some toddlers have a lower threshold of tolerating fructose than others.'

A second and often effective change is to increase the level of fats in your child's diet.

'This may seem at odds with advice on combating obesity, but fats can slow gut transit time and ease diarrhoea,' says Ms More.

'Of course, we're not talking about extra biscuits and doughnuts, but foods such as full-fat yoghurt, whole milk, cheese and a little more cream, butter and oil.' Also it can help to reduce the amount of fibre in the diet, as it may be making gut transit time faster.

'Don't cut it out altogether, but limit it, and keep an eye out for fibrous foods that make the diarrhoea worse,' says Ms More.

'This can differ according to the child. For example, grapes and dried fruit might be fine for one child, but bother another.'

All of these dietary changes can have an impact, but not always. Children do eventually grow out of toddler diarrhoea, 'which is probably due to the gut  maturing with age', says Dr Thomson. He says children with toddler diarrhoea should never be given anti-diarrhoea medicines such as loperamide - which is found in many over-the-counter remedies.

On the whole, children are not distressed by the condition, as it doesn't usually cause any pain.  'It's more often the parents who are suffering because of its social impact and the increased laundry,' says Ms More.

'Having constantly to change clothes and deal with diarrhoea accidents can be very stressful.'Emma Maynard also found that sending her child to nursery was a battle.

'The nursery's handbook says that a child has to stay away for 24 hours after a bout of diarrhoea, so they kept ringing me at work to come and collect him every time he had an accident.

'I tried to explain that he didn't have anything infectious, but it took a letter from the GP for them finally to understand.

'It's not pleasant for them to have to change him when he can't make it to the loo in time, but there's nothing we can do until he grows out of it.'

Alison Gordon's children, Jonah, four, and Ben, 22 months, have the condition.

'Our GP referred us to an allergy specialist when Jonah started having chronic diarrhoea at ten months,' says the 31- year-old financial adviser from East Sussex.

'There is a history of allergy in our family, so we tried cutting out foods such as dairy, but it didn't make any difference.

'We weren't given any other advice apart from that, so we've just soldiered on.'

But like all children with toddler diarrhoea, the boys are strapping and healthy. 'They're huge and growing well and they don't know any different so they're quite happy!' says Alison.

'It's not so bad now that Jonah is toilet-trained. I think he is starting to grow out of it.'

Dr Thomson adds: The most important thing to remember is that if you think your child has toddler diarrhoea, don't be tempted to cut foods out of their diet without specialist help.

'Food groups such as dairy are  vital for a child's growth and health.

'If the suggested dietary changes - cutting out fruit juice and  increasing fats -don't make a difference, I'm afraid it's a case of sit tight and wait for them to grow out of the condition.'
