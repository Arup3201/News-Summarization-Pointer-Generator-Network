Just months after breaking his neck, one gymnast has sprung back into action with his sights set on the 2012 Olympics.

Despite suffering an injury last year that could have left him paralysed for life, 21-year-old Geoff Rellis is due to compete at the Northern European Championships in Sweden later this month.

The determined sportsman landed on his head while attempting a somersault from a vault in August 2010 and was rushed to St George's Hospital in Tooting, London.

X-rays revealed he had suffered a fracture millimetres from his spinal chord, dislocating two vertebrae.

Despite suffering a broken neck that could have left him paralysed for life, 21-year-old Olympic hopeful Geoff Rellis, has returned to gymnastics and is back competing

Geoff, who lives in Tolworth, Surrey, underwent a four-hour operation two weeks later, and spent the following eight weeks wearing a neck brace which left him unable to exercise, causing him to lose a stone in weight.

But after a remarkable turnaround, he was back in the gym in February and has since spent over 30 hours a week training in a 24-hour gym. 

He said: 'The last thing I remembered was pushing from the vault, after that it was black. I had no idea what was happening and when I woke up in hospital I was told I'd broken my neck.

'It was a massive shock at first but it just made me determined and I refused to let it get me down. I was just focused on my recovery and focused on being a gymnast again.'

Geoff, originally from Kildare in Ireland, was practicing at his 
gymnastics club in Tolworth on August 7 last year when he performed a 
move which involved a handstand in which he would push off the vault and
rotate twice in the air.

His girlfriend, Janine Pavlis, 22, was travelling to the gym at the time to film his gymnastic sequence for a YouTube montage.

But as he started to turn mid-air, he
accidentally opened up from the tightly curled ball he was in and 
plummeted to the floor, landing on his head in the foam safety pit.

Determined: It has taken hours of rehabilitation and training in a 24 hour gym to regain strength

After experiencing shooting pains he was immediately rushed to hospital where scans revealed the serious fracture and was operated on two weeks later.

During the four hour operation surgeons fused the two dislocated
vertebrae with a metal frame and bone from his hip, by moving his 
throat to one side.

For months he was left incapable of moving his head and spent time recuperating at home.

He said: 'The muscles in my neck had deteriorated so much I had to lift my head with my hands when I was lying down.

'Until December I couldn't do anything apart from lie in bed at home. I was used to working out every day and instead had to sit down and watch the TV, it was so frustrating. 

'But I refused to accept that I would
never be a gymnast again.'

Last December Geoff started to gain strength 
and confidence using two ballet bars installed at 
his home and in February 2011, his surgeon signed a letter allowing him to return to gymnastics.

Now after months of 
rehabilitation he is back on his feet and in the gym - and taking part 
in international competitions.

He added: 'It hasn't been easy and I have wanted to give up a few times. I wanted to feel a purpose to my 
life again and to get that confidence back.

'If I make the Olympics, it will be a miracle. I should be dead, or at least paralysed.'

Geoff - who was crowned Ireland's national 
gymnastics champion last year - is now hoping to win a late call-up to Ireland's Olympic squad next summer if he gets to the final of this month's competition.
