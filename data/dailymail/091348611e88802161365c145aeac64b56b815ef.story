A bike shop owner has set a new world record after inventing a bicycle that can travel at more than 110mph.

Jason Rourke, 42, spent 10 days building the super-strong mountain bike which cost a total of £5,000.

Motorcycle racer Guy Martin commissioned Mr Rourke to make the bike which he pedalled into the record books at 112.94mph (181km/h) earlier this year.

Mr Martin broke the previous record set by Dutch cyclist Sebastiaan Bowier who reached 83.13mph (133.78 km/h) on a pushbike in September this year.

In order to break the record Mr Martin was towed at 50mph on Pendine Sands in South Wales, before being released where he hit just under 113mph (around 180km/h).

The record breaking attempt features in a new Channel 4 series called 'Speed' which began last night.

All the bike's materials, except the tyres, were sourced from the UK

The vehicle has just one gear which allows the bike go up to 130mph

It uses Continental laminated tyres

The bike is made up of two aluminium wheel frames one tailor-made lightweight steel frame measuring 22inches x 22 inches (56cm x 56cm).

The entire bike weighs 22lbs (10kg)

Mr Rourke, who runs Brian Rourke Cycles in Burslem in Stoke-on-Trent, Staffordshire, said: 'The funny thing is, my dad Brian was contacted by the people who set the current world record asking if we could help to build the bike.

'Due to various work commitments we didn't take it on, so when we got a call from the producers in February about another attempt to break the record, we couldn't say "no".

'I made the bike in the workshop over 10 days and welded the steel frame together and brazed it as well.

'It wasn't a particularly light bike 
because that's not what we were focusing on. We needed to make sure it 
was strong and the tyres actually were quite thick as we needed extra 
tread to grip with.

'Because all the components have been tailor-made, the bike is almost priceless because companies might never 
agree to make them.

'But the price to construct the bike came to roughly £5,000.'

'The fact that we got to work with Guy Martin was incredible. He is someone I have always found interesting having seen a lot of his programmes.

'He came along to our workshop in Burslem with the TV crew so he could get measured up for the bike, and he even helped me to make it.'

Former British Truck Racing Championship winner Dave Jenkins, 38, was also enlisted to help in the record-breaking bid.

He
 said: 'I got a call out of the blue one day from a researcher asking if
 I knew anyone who had a truck capable of doing 120mph, who had 
engineering experience and who could drive the truck.

Bike designer Mr Rourke said: 'The fact that we got to work with Guy Martin (pictured preparing for record) was incredible.' Mr Martin was towed along by a truck at 50mph before being set free to up the speed on his own

'I explained I could tick all three boxes so then found myself meeting up with Guy Martin. It sounded fun and I'm always up for a challenge, so we thought we'd give it a crack.

'It was exciting to take part, but I was also aware of the risks involved. I was conscious of what could happen if things went wrong with someone cycling so close to the rear of the truck.'
