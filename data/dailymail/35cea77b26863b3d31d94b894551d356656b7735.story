A schoolgirl-of-14 who disappeared with a 35-year-old ‘family friend’ was found today in London after a cross country police chase.

Lorna Vickerage ran away with John Bush three days after social services took her from her home in Doncaster, South Yorkshire, and put her in foster care.

After securing air and sea ports across the country, officers tracked the pair through the midlands and down to the capital, where a plain-clothed policeman spotted them at Euston Station in the early afternoon.

Lorna's mother said she was 'ecstatic' after her daughter was found 'safe and well'.

Too much to bear: Lorna's mother, Christine Vickerage (left) and grandmother, Diane Vickerage (right) break down during a press conference outside Doncaster police station today

Located: The pair were found Euston train station (above) in London after they were recognised by an off-duty police officer at 2.35pm

Speaking moments after the news was revealed, Christine Vickerage said: 'I am very, very happy she is home, I'm over the moon.

'It
has been an awful few days. I don't know when I'll get to see her yet 
because she has to come up from London. The family are all happy.'

Police have now arrested Bush on 
suspicion of child abduction and will question them both to establish 
why they fled, with one line of enquiry being that the ‘vulnerable’ 
young girl was in a relationship with her abductor.

A second 35-year-old man was arrested in connection with the alleged kidnapping.

The girl’s parents Christine 
Vickerage and Darren Griffiths, who earlier had desperately appealed for
their daughter’s safe return, were last night said to be ‘over the 
moon’.

South Yorkshire Police detective chief inspector Craig Robinson said: ‘Christine was so pleased. It was unbelievable.’

'They are getting further south': Detective Chief Inspector Craig Robinson feared the pair may try to flee the UK

He added: ‘Mr Bush has been arrested in London at Euston Station and at the time Lorna was with him. Both are safe and well.’

The girl’s mother had earlier 
appealed to Bush to return her safely. A distraught Mrs Vickerage, 36, 
said: ‘John, if you are watching this, fetch Lorna home please. Lorna, 
you are in no trouble, just come home sweetheart.’

Her father, Darren Griffiths, said: 
‘She’s quite independent. She’s usually quite sensible. But, obviously, I
don’t know exactly what’s going off in her head at the minute.

‘She’s quite mixed up, obviously. 
There’s been a lot going off just lately. I just don’t know what she’s 
thinking, to be honest.’

The schoolgirl was last seen at 2.30pm on Monday at Outwood Academy in Adwick wearing her uniform before she went on the run.

Clues: Police believe the pair had been travelling in this silver Ford Mondeo, registration number Y753 CSH, which Bush had borrowed

Seized: Police released a close-up of the alloys on the Mondeo, which was recovered near a hotel in Leicester

She was subsequently spotted with 
Bush on Wednesday in Doncaster, before fleeing south to the village of 
Sproxton, in Leicestershire, where they stayed in a twin room at a 
hotel, telling staff they were father and daughter.

They abandoned a silver Ford Mondeo in a car park on Thursday morning close to Melton Mowbray train station.

At about 11pm that evening they tried
to check into a Holiday Inn Express by Watford Junction station in 
Hertfordshire but Bush’s credit card was declined.

‘It raised suspicion of the 
management who put two and two together and quickly realised these were 
the people who had been circulated across the country,’ DCI Robinson 
said.

Police issued a warrant for child 
abduction and warnings were circulated to all air and sea ports around 
the country before a plain-clothed policeman carrying photographs of the
pair spotted them at Euston Station.

Worried: Lorna with her father Darren Griffiths, who had also appealed for her to come home safe
