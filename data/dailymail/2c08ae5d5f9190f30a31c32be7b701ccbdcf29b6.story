Sheffield Wednesday have announced that Azerbaijani businessman Hafiz Mammadov has completed his takeover of the club.

Mammadov – who also owns French club Lens and FC Baku in his homeland – sealed his deal to buy the Hillsborough club today.

The new owner will replace chairman Milan Mandaric in charge of the club and immediately stated his desire to return them to the Premier League for the first time since 1999-00.

Sold: Milan Mandaric bought Wednesday for £1 in December 2010

'I am immensely pleased and proud to 
have agreed a deal to buy this wonderful club,' Mammadov told 
Wednesday's official website.

'I
 am a passionate football fan with enormous respect for English 
football. I have been looking at investing in England for some time but I
 was determined to find the right club.

'I
 am hugely ambitious and feel the Owls match my passion and desire for 
success and represent our motto of Azerbaijan - Land of Fire.

'I promise the supporters I will work extremely hard to bring the success everyone so rightly craves.'

The deal still requires Football League ratification but Mandaric 
expressed his delight at the news and said he had delivered on his 
promise to the club's supporters.

'I
 am delighted to have concluded a deal with Hafiz, he is a true football
 man and I have no doubt whatsoever that I am handing over control to 
someone with a real passion for the game and the ability to carry on the
 work I started three years ago to return Sheffield Wednesday back to 
the top division of English football,' Mandaric said.

'It's
 something that the wonderful supporters of this club deserve having 
remained so loyal throughout the difficult times prior to my arrival.

'On
 my first day at the club I promised the supporters two things; firstly I
 would ensure that when I left we would be in far better shape than when
 I arrived and more importantly, that I would only hand over ownership 
when I found the right man for the club and I sincerely believe I have 
delivered on both undertakings.'

Wednesday finished 16th in the Championship last term, nine points above the relegation zone.
