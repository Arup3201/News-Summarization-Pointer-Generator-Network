Barcelona players are used to stepping out in front of 90,000 fans week in, week out, but on Friday their first-team stars took some time out when they were surprised with a day at a go-karting track.

Lionel Messi, Neymar and Luis Suarez were all in action as Luis Enrique's side looked to enjoy life in the fast lane.

According to Mundo Deportivo, Gerard Pique came out on top in the team-building exercise, with Martin Montoya second and Thomas Vermaelen third.

Messi may be used to dribbling past players in La Liga, but seemed to find it tough passing his team-mates on Friday morning.

It is not the first time the Barcelona coach has organised such excursions for his players. He did the same while in charge at Barcelona B, Roma and Celta Vigo.  

Coming off the back of an impressive 4-0 win over APOEL Nicosia in the Champions League, the Catalan giants head to the Mestalla to face a dangerous Valencia side on Sunday.

The Barcelona squad were not immune from the pre-race safety talk as they prepared for their go-karting experience on Friday

Jeremy Mathieu spoke to the press at a conference at La Masia after the karting exploits, and he admitted the game would be 'special' for him against his former side.

'It's a special game for me but I won't play any differently. It's always nice to play at Mestalla, I was there for many years,' Mathieu told fcbarcelona.com.

'I don't know how they will receive me – I believe I did myself justice there. Now I am 100% focused on Barca.'

Iniesta looked to be enjoying himself as he posed for the camera during a lap at the go-karting track

Mathieu also hopes Messi will stay at the Nou Camp for the rest of his career. The Argentinian has already had a record-breaking season, beating the all-time La Liga goalscoring record last weekend, before topping the Champions League goalscoring record on Tuesday.

'I think Messi will end his career at FC Barcelona because he is a legend and he has spent his entire career here. I hope for the club and for our sakes that he stays here.' 

Barcelona currently sit second in the La Liga table, behind rivals Real Madrid by two points.
