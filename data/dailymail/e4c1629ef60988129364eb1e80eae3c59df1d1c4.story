Slain West Virginia Sheriff Eugene Crum was remembered Sunday for his warmth, kindness and dedication to tackling Mingo County's pervasive drug problems.

Hundreds of mourners, including nearly 400 law enforcement officers from several states, packed Mingo Central High School for Crum's funeral.

The 59-year-old sheriff was shot to death Wednesday, a little more than three months after taking office.

'We ask all the time where have all the heroes gone?' Mingo County Circuit Judge Michael Thornsbury said during his eulogy. 'Let me tell you, sometimes we walk in their midst and we don't know we got them. He was mine.'

Although county Prosecutor Michael Sparks has said there's no substantial evidence that Crum's death was drug-related, Thornsbury said Crum had received threats due to his job.

'He was aware he was being persecuted by some, but the saving grace was that he knew he was loved by many.'

The last conversation Thornsbury had with Crum included those job risks and occurred just a few minutes before his death.

'He looked at me and he said, "I'm going to fight the good fight,'" Thornsbury said.

And with that, Crum left for lunch.

He was shot as he ate in a downtown Williamson parking lot.

Police charged 37-year-old Tennis Melvin Maynard with murder and the motive is still unclear.

Thornsbury recalled the day he went looking for Crum more than a decade ago when the judge needed to find a chief magistrate.

He tracked down Crum at a bowling alley and swore him into office right there.

Crum stepped down as magistrate in January 2012 in order to seek the sheriff's job. Before winning that job, he was appointed by the prosecutor's office last August as a special investigator for drug enforcement.

Thornsbury said under Crum's short watch as sheriff, the county saw 57 felony convictions, and state Delegate Harry Keith White, who campaigned with Crum last year, said there were more indictments under Crum than the county had seen in the past eight years.

Thornsbury said Crum loved going to Mingo Central football games with his grandson, hanging out with family at his backyard pool and going fishing during the summer on his pontoon boat. But his dream was to unite the sheriff's department.

'It was his destiny,' Thornsbury said. 'When you think about it, many of us don't get the chance to live our dreams. He did.'

Thornsbury said Crum went after drug dealers and buyers 'not for the glory of arrests but because, he said, "I've been to too many funeral homes. I've been to too many wakes. I've seen too many crying families. I've seen too many lost."

'He wanted to do something about it. He wanted to rid the scourge.'

County Commission President John Mark Hubbard said Crum wanted to make a difference, and he did.

'And shame on anyone in this room within the sound of my voice who will not make sure that the change that this man laid his life down for does not continue,' Hubbard said, drawing loud applause.

In between speakers and while a hymn was being sung, Rosie Crum walked to her husband's open casket, stroking his head. A U.S. flag was draped over part of the casket, surrounded by dozens of colorful flower arrangements.

She was appointed interim sheriff the day after his death.

'We need to stand behind her, we need help her and we need to fight for her,' said the Rev. Paul Caudill, a family friend.

'We need to step up. I'm sure he would tell you now, don't give up the fight. Stand for what's right.'

After the funeral, dozens of people lined a road leading to a cemetery in Lenore. Some carried signs and balloons, and two Williamson fire trucks formed an arch draped with a U.S. flag.

'Goodbye to our hero," read a sign made by Cindy McClanahan and her two grandsons as they waited for Crum's hearse.

'He helped everybody he knew,' McClanahan said.

The funeral comes one day after Crum's daughter said she believes there's a 'strong possibility' he was killed because of his dedicated fight against drugs.

'My dad fought tirelessly against drug abuse. He just wanted to clean up the county and make it a better place to live,' his daughter, Julie Hall, told CNN on Saturday.

'Things are still under investigation at this time. We really are unsure,' Crum's daughter said in her first interview since her father's death.

But she says it's a gut feeling that leads her to believe he was killed because of his dedicated public service.

The family of Maynard aren't so sure.

His mother, Olgie Maynard, told CNN her son has spent time in a state hospital for mental health issues in recent years.

She says he was never physical or violent.

'He talks a lot to himself,' she explained of his behavior.

Melvin Maynard, the father of Tennis 
Maynard, said it was an explosion in an Alabama coal mine that 
exposed to chemicals  that led to his deteriorating mental state.

The elder Maynard would not elaborate
on what kind of mental health problems his son had, although according 
to a pending lawsuit he was injured in a 2007 explosion caused by a 
lightning strike at his work.

His father says he 
believes his son would have shot the first person he saw and Crum's death was not targeted.

'I know he should have been in a hospital,' Melvin said, adding that his son had previously been in an institution.

Rosie Crum was sworn into office on Thursday to finish the remainder of her husband's job after county officials agreed she was the best person to continue his legacy of fighting the scourge of prescription pill abuse.

Dozens of mourners turned out to pay their respects to Sheriff Crum on Thursday.

The Williamson Daily News reports that County Commissioner John Mark Hubbard said: 'After much thought and prayer, the three of us have come to believe that the best plan to fulfill this obligation is with the person who knew Eugene the best. The person who knew his stand on crime and drugs, who knew his plans for Mingo County and who was his best friend and soulmate.

'My recommendation is that we appoint Eugene’s widow, Rosie Crum, to fill his position.'

Sheriff Crum led a drug task force and an initiative called Operation Zero Tolerance, making good on a campaign pledge, said Delegate Harry Keith White, who 
campaigned with Crum last year.

He said his friend was shot to death where he regularly parked his patrol vehicle to eat lunch, near the 
site of a former pharmacy known for illegally distributing pills.

'I think anybody you ask would tell you he was a great guy, always with a positive attitude, always trying to help people,' White said. 'It's just a sad, sad day for Mingo County and the state of West Virginia.'

The suspect, who was shot by a deputy, was taken to a hospital in Logan, said Gov. Earl Ray Tomblin's chief of staff Rob Alsop said.

Beloved: Friends say anyone who knew Crum would say he was a great guy who was always surrounded by family as a devote grandfather
