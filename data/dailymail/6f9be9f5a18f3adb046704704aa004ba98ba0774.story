The first hostage to escape from Sydney's Lindt cafe John O'Brien has told of his daring plan which saw him be the first to successfully flee the cafe.

Mr O'Brien said he spotted a green button on the door at one of the entrances to the cafe, and asked one of the staff members if it worked. She said she was unsure.

To make his escape the hostage had to squeeze between the door and an advertising sign, and had alerted lawyer Stefan Baloufitis to his plan.

Without speaking he indicated to his fellow hostage how they would get out. The men knew if it failed, they would most likely be shot.

When gunman Man Haron Monis was distracted, Mr O'Brien crawled along the floor behind the sign so he could reach the button.

John O'Brien told Channel Seven how he plotted his daring escape from the Sydney Lindt cafe on December 15, 2014

To reach it he had to squeeze between an advertising sign and the wall 

'They were the worst 10 seconds of my life, because I thought, if the green button doesn't open, then he'll probably come up and shoot us in the back,' Mr O'Brien told Channel Seven. 

'And they were the worst 10 seconds, waiting for that green button to open. 

'(I) Pushed the button and, hallelujah, it opened! And that was a great moment,' Mr O'Brien told journalist Melissa Doyle.

Mr O'Brien and Mr Baloufitis fled the cafe unharmed, into the arms of SWAT police. 

'That was the most wonderful moment when I turned that corner and the SWAT team were just around there, 20 feet around the corner,' he continued.

Mr O'Brien had to wait until Monis was distracted before he could make his move 

Elly Chen and Jieun Bae were among the second lot of hostages to escape the cafe, and told of how Marcia Mikhael moved closer to the gunman to protect them.

The pair met for the first time that day, as it was Elly's first day at work and Jieun had just returned from holidays.

Jieun had to convince Elly to make a run for it with her, and they managed to unlock the door without being detected.

From there they still had to open the door without a sound, which they managed and fled the cafe without Monis even being aware they were gone.

Elly said although she was regarded as brave, she thought the real hero was Ms Mikhael, who she says saved her life.

'That's what I really didn't understand, when all the police came out and they told me I was brave,' she told the program.

'But I just... I just ran away from this scary situation. I didn't think of it as bravery.'

The two women were also asked to look at the photos which saw them fleeing the cafe with fear in their eyes, and have become some of the most recognisable images.

They said the did not like seeing the photos, and found it hard to reconcile that it was actually them pictured in these widely viewed photographs.

Viswakanth Ankireddy, an IT executive at Westpac also revealed details about his daring escape from crazed gunman Monis. 

He told Channel Seven he had thought about launching at attack on Monis during the day but the reports he had a bomb and the thought of his 4-year-old daughter stopped him making a move.

Mr Ankireddy was the last hostage to escape the cafe before the siege came to its dramatic climax just after two on Tuesday morning.

He told the program he felt a rush of air pass his head as he fled, which he believed to be a gunshot. 

'I felt that rush of air just passing so fast next to my head. I ran and then I fumbled over on the foyer, which is between the Lindt Cafe and another building, and then we just ran away there,' Mr Ankireddy said.

'I heard the cops yell at me, like, "This way, this way." But I wasn't listening. I just ran, crossed Martin Place, ran across and ran along Phillip Street to the end. 

Here Mr Ankireddy ran into the arms of police before he slumped down against a wall while officers checked him for external injuries or a concealed weapon.

But it was his guilt at leaving colleague Marcia Mikhail inside the building which he really grappled with.

'Even now I feel, "Did I make a right choice to run out, "having left my friend Marcia inside?" I don't know. Maybe I should have stayed. I should have... I don't know,' he said.

'Sometimes I feel I should have stayed inside. With Marcia.

'I'm praying and I'm just thinking, "Please, God. Please, God. "Please, God. I need to get out of here alive.'
