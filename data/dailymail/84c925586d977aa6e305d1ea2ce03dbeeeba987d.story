William Buckman, 61, a nationally known figure, was found dead in a hotel room on Tuesday

The death of a prominent New Jersey defense and civil rights attorney who helped expose racial profiling by the State Police in the 1990s has been ruled a suicide.

The body of William Buckman was found on Tuesday at the Residence Inn in Mount Laurel, New Jersey. 

His death was discovered around 8:45 a.m. said Mount Laurel Police Lt. Stephen Riedener reports NJ.com.

He said officers had been asked to check on Buckman's well-being.

'The manner of death was suicide,' Riedener said.

Riedener said the 61-year-old was found in his room and pronounced dead at the scene.

He said no foul play was involved, and the investigation has been closed.

Buckman, who was married with two children, rose to prominence while defending Pedro Soto of Gloucester County in a drug case.

He successfully won a motion to suppress evidence seized during a State Police highway stop on the basis of racial profiling.

The judge ruled that troopers routinely stopped minority motorists in New Jersey based on the their skin color.

He found such stops to be illegal and threw out drug and weapons evidence against Soto and 16 others. 

Buckman famously said he was never stopped on the turnpike because troopers don't look for 'a short, chubby Jewish white person.'  

Buckman's body was found around 8:45 a.m. at the Residence Inn, said Mount Laurel Police Lt. Stephen Riedener. He said officers had been asked to check on Buckman's well-being 

'Bill was a true believer and a dedicated advocate for the principles of freedom, justice, and equality, and New Jersey is a better place because of the work he did,' said Edward Barocas, legal director of the American Civil Liberties Union of New Jersey told Philly.com.

'He was a man with a great sense of humor, a great sense of empathy, and a great sense of justice,' Barocas said.

'He will be greatly missed.' 

Surinder Aggarwal, a former associate of Buckman's told Burlington County Times: 'He was a legal giant and a trendsetter.'

'The bar has really lost a giant.' 

Buckman was president of the William H. Buckman Law Firm in Moorestown and specialized in civil rights cases.

His last tweet was on 13 October and read 'Attorney shuts down police stop of black handyman: ‘Now please leave our neighborhood’ with a link to news website. 

His family have not yet commented on his death.
