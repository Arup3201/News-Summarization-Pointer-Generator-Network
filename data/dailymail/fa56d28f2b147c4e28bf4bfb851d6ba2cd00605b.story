A crooked businesswoman’s expensive wardrobe of designer clothes, handbags and shoes is coming up for sale tomorrow after it was seized by police.

Kankamol Albon was jailed for six years last October after she was convicted of a massive multi-million 'Ponzi' fraud involving scores of prestige cars including Ferraris, Bentleys, Bugattis and Maseratis.

She ran her business from her £4 million moated country mansion in Bures, Suffolk but cheated hundreds of would-be clients.

Ill-gotten gains: Among Albon's haul are items from leading fashion names such as Chanel, Christian Dior, Louis Vuitton, Prada, Mulberry and Fendi

More than 200 lots of top name clothing and accessories will come under the hammer in a sale that could fetch as much as £250,000

After her trial in Ipswich Crown Court, Judge Ruper Overbury granted an order under the Proceeds of Crime Act to sell the 41-year-olds assets, including a BMW and her wardrobe of clothes.

More than 200 lots of top name clothing and accessories will come under the hammer in a sale that could fetch as much as £250,000.

Mother-of-five Albon defrauded investors of more than £7.5million in a pyramid scheme

Among the lots are items from leading fashion names such as Chanel, Christian Dior, Louis Vuitton, Prada, Mulberry and Fendi.

Mother-of-five Albon, who was born in Thailand, lived in style in Grade Two- listed Smallbridge Hall.

She used as a base from which to run her crooked car business.

She defrauded investors of more than £7.5million in a pyramid scheme and was described at her trial as someone whose 'sole motivation was one of excessive greed and desire to buy luxury goods and live an opulent lifestyle'.

Auctioneer Barry Martin, who will sell the lots at Swardstone Village Hall, near Norwich, said: 'Many of these items are now classified as vintage and there has been a huge amount of interest from collectors.

'These are top designer names and we have had inquiries from a lot of fashion businesses.'

DC Andy Finbow, of Suffolk Police’s economic crime unit said: 'We will go to any lengths to ensure that people who seek to enjoy a lifestyle funded by crime will not be tolerated and we will do al we can to strip them of the very things that motivated them to engage in crime in the first instance.'
