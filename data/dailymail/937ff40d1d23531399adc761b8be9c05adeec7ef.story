A 24-year-old from East London has became one of the most distinctive beat-boxers in the world, with such an extraordinary talent that scientists even asked to scan his brain.

Reeps One, whose real name is Harry Yeff, is famous for his unique ability to create bass music using his vocal chords.

The artist believes the key to his success is moving away from the hip-hop style that is historically associated with beatboxers, and instead towards electronic music such as grime, dubstep and drum and bass.

'The electronic influence as a whole completed defined the way I beatbox,' he said. 

'When I started doing that publicly, started not thinking about other beatboxers, not even other musicians, but what resonates with me, it really affected the entire world community.'

'I'm so honoured when people tell me "you're the reason I started beatboxing"'. 

After winning the UK Beatbox Championships twice in a row, Yeff moved on to touring the world, taking the place of DJs to perform high energy, hour long sets in night clubs using just his voice.

Reeps One has now recorded a documentary with Sofar Sounds, a revolutionary music organisation who set up secretive gigs in people's homes

'I'm so honoured when people tell me "you're the reason I started beatboxing'"he said

Last month he flew to New York to judge the American Beatbox Championships alongside American actor and beatboxer Michael Winslow.

Yeff also took up a residency at famous celebrity haunt, The Box, and recorded a documentary with Sofar Sounds, a revolutionary music organisation who set up secretive gigs in people's homes.

'For some reason I seem to have had a massive influence on the American community, and I've felt that in my time here so much,' he said. 

Yeff also took the chance to challenge New York's famous chess hustlers - who play for cash in the city's Union Square - showcasing another of his talents, honed competing in chess tournaments as a teenager.

He said: 'It's the one place where you really see the semi-ghetto vibe mixing with intellectual prowess. 

'I used to turn up to chess tournaments with my flat caps and tracksuits and that energy has always really appealed to me.

'To go and win a few games and hustle the chess hustlers a little bit, was something to tick off the life 'to-do' list.'

So impressive are his skills, scientists at University College London asked him to have a brain scan as part of a study to find out how someone's mind changes when they become an expert.

Neurologists compared the brain activity of Yeff with a novice, while they both beatboxed. 

Yeff  mostly used two brain areas, including the cerebellum - responsible for learning complicated movements.

The novice used many more brain areas, suggesting a need to plan each sound and a lack of automatic processing.

Yeff can feel this natural automation as he performs, 'When I was on a project with a group of soloist musicians, a number of them said to me "When we play our instrument it's an extension, but your voice is completely close to your mind" and this is true.

'That's what makes my performance, I think, so connecting and engaging. It's not a mechanical block, it's shifting and changing and skewing all the time dependent on the reaction of the audience.'
