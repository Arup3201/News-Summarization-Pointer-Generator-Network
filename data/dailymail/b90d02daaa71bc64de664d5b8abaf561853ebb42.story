'Smart parking' bays that inform drivers of available spaces in city centres are to be launched next year.

The revolutionary scheme will see infra-red sensors placed on the 
tarmac of parking spaces, which will detect a vehicle in 
the bay.

Details of spare spaces will be transmitted to a central computer system and then fed to drivers via a smartphone app.

Free space: 'Smart parking' bays that can detect when spaces are free will be rolled-out across Westminster, pictured, Birmingham, Manchester and Edinburgh next year

Drivers will also be able to enter a postcode to see any vacant spaces in their surrounding area.

It is unclear how frequently the app will be updated to inform drivers that certain spaces are filled.

After trialling the system on five streets,
 Westminster City Council will introduce the technology from 
January.

Approximately 3,000 so-called SmartEye sensors will be 
installed at all metered and disabled parking bays in the West End of 
London.

Birmingham, Manchester and Edinburgh are also conducting trials.

Council leaders 
say that as well as sparing motorists the hassle of driving around busy 
streets searching for a space, carbon emissions should be cut as well.

Westminster calculates that motorists who decide against public transport spend on average 15 minutes looking for a parking space once they have reached the city centre.

The council says that if the system — which is being paid for out of parking receipts — works it will be extended to 7,000 bays across the city.

Stephen Glaister, director of the RAC Foundation, told The Times: 'We have all driven in circles looking for somewhere to park when there is an empty bay around the corner we just don’t know about.

'This technology is already used in the States and the evidence shows a big rise in the utilisation of parking bays as motorists are matched with spaces. As a consequence there is less congestion.'

Professor Glaister said that in Los Angeles and San Francisco data from the sensors was used to set different charges for individual bays based on the demand for parking at specific locations. 'This demonstrates to drivers that parking charges are about managing traffic and not raising revenue in the form of a stealth tax,' he said.

He added that he would be concerned that people would spend more time not looking at the road and instead looking at screens of smartphones or sat-navs.

Fines: Councils rolling-out the scheme insist it will not be used to collect parking fines (library image)

Councils planning to roll-out the scheme insist they will not be using the technology to collect money via parking fines.

Councils in England reaped £601 million from parking last year. It is thought they may collect £635 million this year.

Westminster made the biggest profit of all councils, at £41.6 million - claiming the money is invested in roads and road infrastructure.
