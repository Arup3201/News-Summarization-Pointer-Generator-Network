A police officer, believing he'd sprung a car of stoners last week, discovered instead that what he thought was marijuana was in fact just a moldy French fry.

The not-so-tasty morsel smelled like pot to cop, who'd initially pulled over the driver and his friends due to a burned license plate light.

The amusing incident was caught on video and posted on YouTube on July 1, and shows the officer asking to see IDs from all the men in the car and explaining why they were pulled over.Â

Not weed: A police officer, pictured, believing he'd sprung a car of stoners last week, discovered instead that what he thought was marihuana was in fact just a moldy French fry

He then ordered the driver out of the car, and after a little protesting, he followed the officer's orders.

Though as the cop reached through the window to help unlock the door, he took in a whiff of what he thought was the drug.

'I smelled weed in the car... I see something in the back seat,' the policeman said, after the driver was on the sidewalk.

'Weed?' responded the driver.

The cop then told the passengers to get out and sit next to their friend as he asked for permission to search the vehicle.

The driver agreed but insisted there was nothing untoward in the car.

'I let him search my car after he claims "he saw and smelled weed" because I knew I had nothing illegal in my car,' YouTube user Joe Mugga wrote.

During the search, the friends began to suspect what the officer had saw.

'He saw crumbs of French fries, yo,' one of the men joked from the curb.

And the pals were on the money.

After a few minutes, the officer emerged from the car with something in his hand.

'It was a moldy, old French fry,' he acknowleged, and the men burst out laughting.

According to Joe Mugga, the incident shows that cops 'feel they can break rules/laws. When and will this ever end?'
