A pair of twins who live parallel lives, even working the same job, have taken their double life to extremes - by giving birth on the same day.

Heather Richardson and Sarah Fidler, 35, were already as close as can be after growing up together, choosing the same university and taking identical jobs as science technicians at a secondary school in North Shields, Tyneside.

But, despite both women having discovered that they were pregnant on the same day, the uncanny sequences of events seemed to end when they were given different due dates.

The twins - who say they 'feel the same pains' as each other - were taken to separate hospitals as the day drew nearer, with Heather set for a caesarian while Sarah opted for a natural birth.

However, just as Heather's daughter Emelie Frances was removed via C-section at Newcastle's Victoria Infrimary early on Thursday morning last week, her sister's contractions began at the Wansbeck General Hospital in Ashington.

By the afternoon, she too had given birth to a child - a baby boy named Austin.

After the births, both were moved to North Tyneside General Hospital for post-natal care, and are in cubicles next to to one another.

Peas in a pod: The sisters say they have always been close - and can even feel one another's pain

Sarah, from Linton, near Ashington in Northumberland, said: 'I honestly didn’t think that I would go into labour at the same time. My contractions started at 1.20am, the exact moment Emelie was born by C-section, and I had Austin at 2.55pm that day.'

Heather, who lives with her husband Daniel in North Tyneside, said: 'We do feel the same pains and if the other one is upset, we can feel it.

'We are really close and have been ever since we were little but I can’t believe this. The staff at all the hospitals involved said they have never heard anything like it.'

The siblings  both work at St Thomas More RC Academy at North Shields as science technicians and both studied at Sunderland University.

After being a double-pack of pregnancy tests in June, Heather discovered she was pregnant, and rushed to tell Sarah and her husband Sean.

And, using the second kit from the back, Sarah discovered the same day that she was pregnant.

Sean said: 'To me it feels as though we’ve had twins ourselves. Not only have I got a son but I’ve got a daughter as well.'

The sisters’ dad John Gibbs, of Morpeth, Northumberland, was also delighted to hear he had become a grandfather twice in one day and that their mum Frances, who died four years ago, will be remembered by both of their middle names.

Daniel, who has known his brother-in-law since their school days, said: 'We would really like to thank the NHS staff at all three hospitals for their care. They’ve been fantastic.'

Midwife Annwa Atkinson, said: 'This is the first time I’ve ever known this to happen. It’s so rare and to have them both on the ward confused us greatly.'
