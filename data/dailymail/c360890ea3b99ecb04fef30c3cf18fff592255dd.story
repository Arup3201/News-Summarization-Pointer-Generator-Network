An aircraft preservation group has denied a millionaire's claim that it found pioneering aviator Amelia Earhart's missing plane in 2010 but sat on the news so it could solicit him to pay for a later search.

Mystery has surrounded Earhart's fate since her plane disappeared in 1937 in the South Pacific.

Earhart was the first woman to fly across the Atlantic Ocean in 1932 but many experts believe she crashed into the Pacific a few years later while trying to establish a record as the first woman to fly around the world.

Timothy Mellon, son of the late 
philanthropist Paul Mellon, filed a federal lawsuit in Wyoming last week
against The International Group for Historic Aircraft Recovery (TIGHAR) and 
Richard E. Gillespie, the group's executive director.

Enduring riddle: American aviator Amelia Earhart, posing by her plane in Long Beach, California, in 1930, disappeared while flying over the Pacific in 1937

Fate: The Electra taking off from Oakland Airport at Alameda, California, on the first leg of her proposed world spanning flight

Mellon,
who lives in Riverside, Wyoming, claims the Delaware group solicited $1
million from him last year without telling him it had found Earhart's 
plane in its underwater search two years earlier.

Mellon's
lawsuit says the 2010 search in the waters around the Kiribati atoll of
Nikumaroro, about 1,800 miles south of Hawaii, captured underwater 
images of the 'wreckage of the Lockheed Electra flown by Amelia Earhart 
when she disappeared in 1937'.

The
suit claims the aircraft recovery group intentionally misrepresented 
the status of its exploration to Mellon last year, telling him a 
discovery of Earhart's plane was yet possible if he supported the 
search. 

The lawsuit 
states Mellon contributed stock worth more than $1 million to the 2012 
search and accuses the organization of engaging in a pattern of 
racketeering to defraud him.

Discovery? A grainy sonar image released last month by TIGHAR off the Pacific island of Kiribati could show the remains of Amelia Earhart's doomed plane

Tim
Stubson, a Casper lawyer representing Mellon, said on Monday that he 
has viewed the images from the 2010 search that the lawsuit maintains 
show the wreckage of Earhart's plane.

'As
a layman, it is hard to see, unless you know what you're looking at 
it,' Stubson said of the footage, which he said he couldn't share. 

'Much of it relates to the landing gear and parts that are unique to the landing gear.'

Stubson
said Mellon engaged experts to examine the underwater images against 
parts they knew were unique to the Earhart aircraft.

He
said they reached a 'definitive conclusion that that is in fact the 
wreckage, and it had been discovered two years before our client paid 
for another expedition'.

Stubson
acknowledged that the aircraft preservation group might have had more 
to gain by publicizing a true discovery of the Earhart wreckage.

But he 
noted: 'For whatever reason they didn't do that in this case, and they 
continue to solicit funds under the pretense that they have not found 
it.'

Bill Carter, a lawyer 
in Boise, Idaho, represents the group, known as TIGHAR, and was a team 
member on the 2010 Earhart search mission.

He
said on Monday the organization strongly denies Mellon's claim that it 
found the plane. He said it is raising funds for another search that 
could occur as soon as the end of next year.

'TIGHAR
does not possess any definitive evidence as to the whereabouts of 
Earhart's Lockheed Electra, and did not conclusively make any 
discoveries in 2010 which it's withheld,' Carter said.

'All of its information and its research is compiled and available for public viewing on its website.'

Carter
said he respects Mellon's opinion but isn't aware of any videographic 
or forensic expert who has validated his conclusions.

'I
have looked at some of the underwater imagery that he's referring to. I
was, in fact, present during the 2010 expedition when that imagery was 
taken,' he said. 'And I can just tell you that I don't see any of the 
things that Tim sees in those images.'

Carter
said he's been a member of the group for 17 years and sits on its board
of directors. He said he's been involved in the Earhart search for at 
least that long.

'I would 
tell you that there is no financial gain for us in hiding the discovery 
of the most famous missing aviator in the history of aviation,' Carter 
said.

'Just the opposite; we would want to publicize the finding to ensure that we can protect it adequately.'

Intrigue: In her day, Earhart was extremely popular, but her mysterious death has kept that fame alive 75 years later

The most widely accepted theory is that the aircraft ran out of fuel and ditched in the sea. There have been several searches by many different professionals eager to solve the mystery, but none have been proven.

Another popular theory is that they landed on the island of Nikumaroro in the Phoenix Islands, 350 miles southeast of Howland Island and fended for themselves for several months until they succumbed to injury or disease.

Improvised tools and bits of Plexiglas that are consistent with that of an Electra window were found on the island.

A few theorists reckon that she Earhart was spying on Japan and had been captured and executed. This theory has been discounted by the American authorities and press.

A rumour claimed that she was one of many women sending messages on Tokyo Rose, an English-language Japanese propaganda station designed to attack the Allies' morale.

An Australian aircraft engineer said he found a map that showed Earhart and Noonan may have turned round to try and refuel but crashed before getting to an airstrip.

The most wacky theory is that she was still alive and had a different identity.

A woman from New Jersey successfully sued for $1.5million in damages from the author of a book who pursued this theory.
