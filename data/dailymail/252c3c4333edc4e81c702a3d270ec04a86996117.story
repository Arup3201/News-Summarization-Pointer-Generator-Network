Blundering French transport chiefs have wasted millions on underground escalators that are 10cm too wide.

The news of the ineffective escatlors comes just months after buying trains that are too wide for the platforms

Now 30 of the escalator stairs on the Paris Metro will have to be replaced at a cost of six million euros.

They were installed in 2005/2006 but have been subject to frequent breakdowns ever since. 

Blundering French transport chiefs have waste millions on a new underground escalators that are 10cm too wide just months after buying trains that are too wide for the platforms 

'The steps of the recent models are one metre wide instead of 90cm,' explained David Courteille, who is in charge of electromechanical engineering for RATP, reported Le Figaro.

The escalator was designed to be 10cm wider to accommodate more users, but this has prevented them from working properly and they consistently break down to the chagrin of commuters. 

The constant repairs cost RATP tens of thousands of euros each year so the operator has decided to cut its losses and will begin replacing the faulty escalators over the next year.

According to Le Figaro the Paris transport company has opened up legal proceedings against suppliers CNIM (Constructions industrielles de la Méditerranée) with the aim of forcing the company to stump up part of the costs.

France is already facing a multi-million pound bill after ordering 2000 new trains which are 3cm (0.11 inches) too wide for many of its platforms

But today RATP chiefs denied Mr Courteille's claim and insisted claims the regular breakdowns are due to the fact parts of the machinery are too fragile.

France is already facing a multi-million pound bill after ordering 2000 new trains which are 3cm (0.11 inches) too wide for many of its platforms.

The incredible mistake means that 1300 stations will have to be upgraded so as to accommodate the trains.

 Rail operations ordered the new trains for the country's regional network – one which traditionally has a reputation for being one of the best in the world.

But they are too wide to travel through the nation's stations, a report in the investigative weekly, Le Canard Enchaine, reveals.

Repair work has so far been carried out on 300 of the platforms that need adjusting, and hundreds more are on a waiting list. On average, the trains are 3cms too wide.

RFF, the organisation responsible for rail tracks in France, has set aside the equivalent of more than £45m to deal with the mistake, but the figure is likely to be well above £100m once it is finished.
