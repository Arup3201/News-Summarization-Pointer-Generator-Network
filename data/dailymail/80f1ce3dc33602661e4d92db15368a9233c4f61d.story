The White House was full of photography enthusiasts recently after they were invited to visit and take pictures for Instagram.

Those chosen for the special ‘InstaMeet’ occasion were people who already followed the White House on Instagram, according to the White House's online blog.

The Instagrammers toured the South Lawn and the Kitchen Garden during their tour of the White House.

They also met the White House grounds superintendent, Dale Haney, the executive pastry chef Bill Yosses and the two, four-legged members of the Obama Family, Bo and Sunny.

The group was also given an opportunity to sit down with Chief Official White House Photographer Pete Souza, who spent time talking through some of his photos and answered questions about what it takes to capture a great photo.
