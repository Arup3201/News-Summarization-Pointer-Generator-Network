Actress Salma Hayek's younger brother Sami may face manslaughter charges after being involved in a fatal car crash in Los Angeles last February.Â 

The 40-year-old furniture designer was driving his sister's 2006 Ford GT sports car when he fishtailed on a curvy stretch of Sunset Boulevard and hit a pickup truck head on. While the driver of the truck incurred only minor injuries, Sami's passenger Ian Cuttler Sala, a Grammy Award-winning art director, died.

Since the crash, cops have obtained a search warrant, focusing on the sports car's restraint control module, which is like a black box. They believe the RCM will confirm what they heard from witnesses - that Sami stamped on the gas pedal just before losing control of the car and crossing the center lane.

If so, authorities think they may be able to hit Sami with charges of felony vehicular manslaughter.

Sami's sister is also involved in the case since she and her husband legally own the car.

Under California law, if the victim's family sues, the registered owners are also liable to pay damages.

The deadly crash happened around 4:50pm on February 23 as Sami and Sala were traveling eastbound on Sunset Boulevard and crossed into the westbound side, hitting a 2011 Toyota pickip truck.

Sala died at the scene while Hayek was taken to UCLA Medical Center for several broken ribs and facial lacerations.

The driver of the truck, 20-year-old Alvin Javier Gomez was also hospitalized for a broken foot and body pains.

Investigators initially believed Sami may have been unfamiliar with the vehicle and said he was not drinking or on drugs.

'Too
 much speed on a curved roadway, tried to over-correct and unfortunately
 crossed into opposing lanes,' Sgt Stephanie Krajchir told KTLA.

The
 sports car Hayek was driving is worth approximately $165,000 according 
to Kelley Blue Book, and can reach speeds of up to 205 mph.

Witness Syed Abrar says accidents are normal on this particular curve of Sunset Boulevard.

Two
 hours after a KTLA news crew arrived on the scene, two more accidents 
happened - though no one seemed to be seriously hurt in either.

According to Sala's website, he worked at Sony Music NY for nine years before becoming a photographer.

At Sony he created visual campaigns for musicians like Beyonce, Billy Joel and Mariah Carey.

As
 a photographer he has shot advertisements for Converse, Gillette and 
Lincoln Center as well as editorials for several magazines.

He earned his Grammy Award designing the packaging for 'Johnny Cash: The Legend' box set.

Sami
 and older sister Salma were born to parents Diana Jimenez Medina, an 
opera singer and talent scout, and Sami Hayek Dominguez, a businessman 
who once ran for mayor of Coatzacoalcos, Mexico.

Hayek currently runs his own 
design studio in Los Angeles, but originally started off studying 
business administration at Pepperdine.

While studying abroad at the University's Florence campus one year, he had a sudden change of heart.

'I stood up, turned my test in, walked to a phone booth woke my dad up and said, I'm out,' Hayek told People.

He told his father he was going to be a painter, sculptor or architect, to which is father responded: 'Your head is not right.'

But his jump into the creative field paid off, and he has since designed furniture for the likes of Brad Pitt.

He is married to jewelry-designer Daniela Villegas and the two live in a home in the Hollywood Hills.
