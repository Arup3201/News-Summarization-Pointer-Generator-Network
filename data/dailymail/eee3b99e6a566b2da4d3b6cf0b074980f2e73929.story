Andrew Willis is prepared to be the least popular man in Glasgow by beating home favourite Michael Jamieson in the 200metres breaststroke at the Commonwealth Games.

Willis and Jamieson, the Olympic silver medallist and one of the faces of Glasgow 2014, train together in Bath and are close friends.

'If it was going to be anyone I hope it's me,' Willis told Press Association Sport.

Man with a plan: Andrew Willis wants to beat Michael Jamieson in his hometown at the Commonwealth Games

'We got a slight taste of the welcome he'll get at the Duel in the Pool back in December.

'He's going to get a loud reception. I have to use that to my advantage and really just give it my all.'

The pair's relationship is likely to be on good terms until they enter the call room - where swimmers wait in the final minutes before their events - when the serious business begins.

Willis knows it will not be easy to beat Jamieson, who leads the world rankings this year with two minutes 07.79 seconds, set in the British Championships in the Tollcross pool which will be used for Glasgow 2014.

Five of the top-10 200m breaststroke times this year have been set by Commonwealth swimmers, with Willis eighth in the rankings behind Scottish duo Jamieson and Ross Murdoch, Australia's Christian Sprenger and England team-mate Adam Peaty.

Competition in the 200m breaststroke has long been strong, with Jamieson, Willis and the now-retired Kris Gilchrist all battling for British team places for some time.

Willis believes the strength of domestic competition helps when it comes to major events.

'It's always tight to qualify for Games,' the 23-year-old added.

'It's all tight stuff, especially when it's two or three of you going through.

'It's quite nerve-racking at the trials. There's so much depth and that does help when you do qualify for the majors.

'It helps through the rounds, through the heats, through the semis, you're used to racing and having to get up to race every race.'

Willis was fourth in Delhi, his first major multi-sport Games, but wants to do better four years on.

He added: 'I want to be coming away with a medal. That was my first international in Delhi. I was chuffed with coming fourth.

'I've been to all the major Games now, multi-sports, worlds. I need to be stepping up and getting on the podium.'

It remains to be seen if that will be above Jamieson, or to one side.Â
