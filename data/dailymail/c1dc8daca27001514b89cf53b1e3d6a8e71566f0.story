Many parents will concede that the school gates can be a hotbed of gossip and competition between proud mothers and fathers.

Those tensions appear to have boiled over at one infant school when a brawl broke out between two mothers.

The fight became so heated as more and more parents entered the fray that police were forced to use pepper spray to control the situation.

The headmistress said she was left ‘disgusted’ by the incident.

Playground fight: Police used pepper spray on a man in the grounds of Penryn Infant School, Cornwall, following a dispute

Officers arrived on the scene at the end
of the school day after teachers reported two women having a ‘full on 
fight’ in front of terrified pupils, who are aged three to seven.

Police separated the mothers who  were trading punches and using 
‘disgusting language’, according to witnesses. However, the violence 
spiralled as  parents who had gathered at the gates to pick up their 
children joined in the  argument. It is not known what they were 
fighting about.

When a man became violent outside the school, officers were forced to 
use CS spray to restrain him. An unnamed man was arrested at the scene.

One parent of Penryn Infant School in Cornwall said the incident last week left her child too afraid to attend classes.

She said: ‘As the children came out these people started fighting and the language was disgusting.

‘It was horrible. The children were all stunned, diving to their mums’ sides.

‘School should be the safest place for kids to go and seeing it happen there was unbelievable.

‘We were all shaking and I was in tears when I got home. Lots of other 
mums said their children were too upset and having nightmares to go back
the next day.’

Probe: Police were called to the infant school in Cornwall after two mothers were allegedly fighting. They arrested a man after using pepper spray on him

A spokesman for Devon and Cornwall Police said that as children were 
waiting to be collected, parties ‘related to  the women’ started 
‘behaving in a disorderly way’.

Officers used captor spray, a pepper-based CS spray, to subdue a man who was allegedly assaulting a pupil’s mother.

Police Constable Jules Evans said: ‘We went to prevent a breach of the 
peace but the male involved would not heed advice and became very 
aggressive and assaulted another parent.

‘As a result of his behaviour we were forced to use the spray and physically restrain him.’

Officers visited the school again the following day. PC Evans said: ‘The
police spend a lot of time ensuring children feel safe approaching us 
and we felt it was important we get back to the school to reassure 
children and parents.’

Headteacher Gillian Wright said she was ‘disgusted’ by the incident.

She said: ‘Children who are very young have witnessed something they 
never should have.

That behaviour should never have happened.
‘Safety and happiness are the most important things for children at the school.’

She said the parents involved had been banned from both the infant 
school and neighbouring junior school sites until the end of the July 
term.

She added that police were right to use pepper spray to break up the fight.

She said: ‘They dealt with it quickly and could not have done it any 
more efficiently. If I had to call the police and wait for them to 
arrive it could have been so much worse.’

The arrested man was released on bail without charge pending inquiries.
