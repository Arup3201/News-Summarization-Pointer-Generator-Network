Dressed casually in a sweater and baseball cap behind the till surrounded by spirits, this is the photo which shows Barack Obama's uncle continuing to dodge deportation charges while working in a liquor store.

Onyango Obama, the son of the President's grandfather, faces allegations of drink-driving and has also been handed a deportation order.

The illegal immigrant 67-year-old, described as 'Uncle Omar' in President Obama's book, has allegedly been living illegally in the U.S. since 1992.

Framingham, Massachusetts

But while his distant nephew may be Commander in Chief, Onyango Obama was spotted this week making ends meet working behind the till at Conti Liquors in Framingham, Massachusetts.

Onyango was arrested in August in Framingham on drink-driving charges over allegations he almost collided with a police car.

Reports at the time claimed that he 
pleaded not guilty to the charges and said he would 'call the White 
House' when he was arrested.

On Thursday a lawyer for Onyango Obama told a judge he plans to file a motion to suppress the traffic stop that led to his client's arrest in August because Obama was not committing any motor vehicle violations.

Obama, dressed in a double-breasted suit and tie, has pleaded not guilty.

He did not speak during the brief appearance in Framingham District Court.

A hearing on his lawyer's suppression request is scheduled for January 12 of next year.

Omar Obama, born on June 3, 1944, is the U.S. President's half-uncle.

Born in Nyang’oma Kogelo, Kenya, as the oldest son of Onyango and Sarah Obama, he normally goes by his father's name.

Onyango Jr moved to America in 1963
 as part of Tom Mboya's Airlift Africa project, where Kenyan students 
were flown to the U.S. to study at American universities.

His father Onyango is Barack 
Obama's paternal grandfather, while his mother Sarah is Onyango Sr's third 
wife and although not a blood relative, is referred to by the U.S. President as 'Granny Sarah'.

Barack Obama's father, Barack Senior, was a Government economist in Kenya who died in 1982. As well as the U.S. President, Barack Obama fathered one daughter and at least four sons.

Barack Obama's mother, Ann Dunham, was an American anthropologist who died in 1995.

In 1962, a year after Barack Obama Jr was born, his father left the family to go to Harvard and pursue a PhD in economics.

Two years later the couple's 
three-year marriage ended in divorce, with Barack Obama Jr being raised 
by his mother and her parents.

Onyango Obama is believed to have come to the U.S. in 1963 to attend a high-profile prep school in Massachusetts.

He dropped out and was ordered to leave the country in 1989. He appealed the decision - but in 1992, he lost.

However, it is thought the deportation order was never enforced, and Obama has been living illegally in the U.S. ever since.

White House Press Secretary Jay Carney said soon after Obama was arrested that he would not receive any special treatment.

Prior
 to his court appearance today, Barack Obama's uncle was seen
 arriving at the liquor store in Framingham before completing a shift 
behind the counter selling alcohol to customers.

He
 had been arrested in August after he allegedly nearly collided with an 
unmarked police patrol car near a fried chicken shop in Framingham, near
 Boston.

The
 policeman and another driver both slammed on their brakes after Onyango
 went through a stop sign, a judge heard at an earlier hearing.

Arresting
 officer Val Krishtal said Obama was 'moderately unsteady on his feet' 
and was unable to walk in a straight line or balance on one leg.

The President’s uncle also allegedly declared 'Maybe I should call the White House', when granted his prison phone call.

Onyango Obama said he would like to phone his powerful nephew
 after being offered the customary free call by police in Massachusetts when he was arrested in August.

Family tree: Barack Obama is one of eight children his father Barack 
Obama Snr had. His 'Uncle Omar', whose real name is Omar but was changed to Onyango, is the son of Sarah Obama, his 
grandfather's third wife
