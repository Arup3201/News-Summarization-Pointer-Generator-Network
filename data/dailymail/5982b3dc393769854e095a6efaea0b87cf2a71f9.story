An unlucky-in-love singleton in her late twenties has been put up for 'sale' by her family on eBay - in a bid to find her a steady boyfriend.

Sammy Maalem, 27, who lives in Cardiff, has been single for a year after being dumped, messed around, and even cheated on.

So her brother Kyle, 28, decided to get involved to find her the perfect man - by selling off a date with the beauty to the highest bidder under the heading: 'Date my sister'.

The starting bid was £50 on the internet auction site listing.

The online advert read: 'Firstly this is a serious advert. 

'My sister is 27 years old, originally from London but now lives in Cardiff, and is slim and curvy, 5ft 4in, blue eyes dark hair. Very bubbly and outgoing. She not a party animal and very faithful. No kids but would like kids eventually.

'My sister is unlucky with finding a real man. So me and my family are looking for someone who is a great guy who is genuine. Loving. Faithful. Normal. And just very down to earth. Also musts are Must have a job. No bums please. Must have a car or be willing to commute if your far away. Must be decent looking. Pref taller then 5ft 8in Must be kind hearted and genuine.

'Must be aged 27-35. Must be family orientated as we are also a close family. No silly boys. No one expecting 1 night stands. No one confused if they are straight or not. No weirdos. No married or engaged men. No overseas and must be within a 150 mile radius.

'Genuine people only this is for a date with my sister that will hopefully be on-going. This is a genuine advert which my sister knows about.'

Sammy was furious when she first found out she was being advertised

The advert also joked about free postage and packaging being included and bidders are warned that the 'item' has been previously used.

Sammy who works with Kyle in the family's jewellery business in Cardiff said: 'I was absolutely livid when I saw what Kyle had done. Kyle has been threatening for years to put me on Ebay but I never took him seriously, so I was shocked to see myself on there - it was quite scary. It was funny but listing me as used definitely wasn't - the cheek of it.

'I haven't had very good relationships in the past and I have tried dating sites which really wasn't for me. I have a had a few relationship, the longest which lasted two years, but they have never worked out.

'A lot of my friends - even my younger sister - are in loving relationships, some are even married with children and I am sick of going out with immature guys, I need someone I can settle down with. 'All I want is a decent guy with good morals and who is honest and faithful, it really has got harder to meet decent people.

'When the Ebay bids close I will probably go ahead with it, my brother went through all that trouble and because he is vetting the bidders I feel at ease, he is very protective of me so I trust his judgement.'

Kyle said: 'I have never thought Sammy's boyfriends have been good enough for her, a lot of them have had quite a lot of baggage and Sammy needs someone without any ties.

'I was tired of her getting messed around all the time, she's a brilliant person and at least now I can vet these guys for myself.

'I have had quite a lot of enquiries, a lot of people asking if it is a genuine Ebay post. I had one guy who refused to give me his Facebook page - at the end of the day I am not interested in any shifty guys for Sammy.

'She has asked me to take the post down quite a few times - she was quite embarrassed, I kind of just told her 'oh sis you're for sale' and she wasn't too happy.'

Sammy's mother Natalie, 52, who has been married for 30 to husband Simon, 54, said:

Mrs Maalen said: 'My daughter is the most warm-hearted person you could ever want to meet and in my opinion the perfect girlfriend.

'She isn't nasty, or possessive or self-centred, she is just a lovely girl who is beautiful both inside and out.

'She has struggled to get a job for the past few months and has been down on her luck so Kyle thought it would be a nice surprise to show off his matchmaking skills.

'Only she screamed the house down when she found out, she was really annoyed that he listed her as used.

'But now she sees the funny side to it and I think she would be up for a date once the bidding is ended provided they are a good guy - her last relationship was over a year ago.

'She has messed around quite a few times in the past and has even been cheated on, I think she deserves a knight in shining armour to take care of her.'

'We have had quite a few calls to the house but until they bid Natalie isn't dating anybody, she really wants to settle down and have children but just can't seem to find the right guy to do it.

'She needs a man, not a boy.'

The first listing ended with no bids but has since been relisted.
