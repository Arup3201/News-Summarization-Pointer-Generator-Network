It took Michelangelo four years and changed the tradition of Renaissance art forever. 

But one retired decorator, armed with a £2 book on painting from a car boot sale, has created his own version of the iconic Sistine Chapel ceiling and has one more room to go until he completes the entire building.

Robert Burns has spent 10 years transforming his council house in Brighton to resemble the Pope's official residence in the Vatican city, which displays the efforts of Michelangelo and other Renaissance greats.

And remarkably the 67-year-old has never seen the chapel which inspired his craft, or even visited Italy.

Robert Burns has spent 10 years transforming his council home in Brighton room by room to decorate it in the style of the Sistine Chapel

He was inspired to create his own version of the ceiling painted by Italian artist Michelangelo after he got a book on Renaissance Art for £2

'I have done this all from books,' said father-of-three Mr Burns. 

'I have never seen any of these paintings in situ. I never went to art classes, I just saw a guidebook to the Vatican and thought "this is amazing, I will have a go at making this."'

'The first few attempts were a bit iffy but I just painted over them.

 'I am pretty quick now. I can paint a ceiling in a couple of weeks.

'I started painting my house this way 10 years ago when I bought a book about the Vatican City for £2 at a car boot sale.

'I loved the Renaissance artwork and was hooked start away - I didn't stop me that I've never been to Italy.

Mr Burns said at first he did not like the Renaissance artwork in his home but he was encouraged by his wife and has decorated most rooms

The pensioner retired as an artist five years ago, giving him more time to focus on decorating his home and creating his own unique portraits 

Mr Burns said he spends around six hours painting a day and can now complete a ceiling in just two weeks - a lot less than Michelangelo

The retired painter said his work is addictive and he keeps adding different pieces to his creations, such as his Renaissance-style ceiling 

The Sistine Chapel ceiling, produced by Michelangelo, took four years and has seen around six million visitors a year flock to view it 

'When I first started I was working as a painter and decorator but I didn't like the Renaissance artwork in the house at first.' 

Mr Burns said he was encouraged to continue by his wife and has just one room left to complete at his three-bedroom home in East Sussex.  

It may have taken him longer than the four years Michelangelo spent painting the chapel's ceiling, but the decorator is hopeful his masterpiece will be completed by early next year.

The ambitious painter has also added his own style to the transformation - with paintings of celebrities including chef Nigella Lawson and music mogul Simon Cowell.

Mr Burns said he is proud of his efforts at his council home in Brighton and would now not consider moving home and leaving his works 

His works throughout the 1960s terraced home in Brighton have transformed it and are in the style of Renaissance paintings

Mr Burns said he has been asked by friends, his three children and grandchildren when he will stop, but there is always something to add in 

Every single room at the property in Brighton - even the bathroom has been meticulously decorated in the Renaissance style by the painter

Mr Burns said his last undecorated bedroom had been magnolia for the past five years and he had been hoping to finish it before Christmas for the arrival of three of his children and three grandchildren.

He said: 'People have asked me what I will do when it is finished but Renaissance decoration was so over the top, I could just keep adding to them forever.

'I spend up to six hours a day painting in the house and I'm very proud to be living here.

'I hope to complete the whole house early next year and I don't plan on moving - unless I win the lottery.' 

Mr Burns' home includes his own unique twist on art, such as this portrait of celebrity chef Nigella hanging proudly in one of the rooms

After news of his creations spread, Mr Burns revealed he was asked to redecorate a luxury mansion outside Horsham which took three months

Mr Burns has one remaining magnolia bedroom in his home which he plans to redecorate to complete the transformation of his entire house 

Mr Burns retired as a painter and decorator five years ago, which has given him more time to focus on his own art. 

He has previously painted comedian Russell Brand as Jesus, football star Wayne Rooney in prayer and Chelsea boss Jose Mourinho as Leonardo da Vinci's Salvator Mundi. 

Mr Burns was also contacted by a Brighton millionaire in 2007 to redecorate the ballroom ceiling of his luxury mansion outside Horsham - which took three months to complete.

The Sistine Chapel is in the Apostolic Palace, in the Vatican. Italian painter Michelangelo was commissioned by Pope Julius II to paint the ceiling, which he completed between 1508 and 1512. 

He was originally commissioned to paint 12 apostles but demanded a free rein in the design for the scheme. 

The completed ceiling features a series of 9 paintings showing God's Creation of the World, God's Relationship with Mankind, and Mankind's Fall from God's Grace

Michelangelo returned between 1535 and 1541 to paint The Last Judgement on the wall behind the altar, and his works have drawn thousands of visitors to the chapel. 

Around six million visitors flock to see the impressive artwork of the Sistine Chapel every year, and numbers of guests are now limited 

The side walls of the chapel are divided into three main tiers. 

Centrally there are two paintings, The Life of Moses and The Life of Christ. They were commissioned in 1480 by Pope Sixtus IV and executed by Domenico Ghirlandaio, Sandro Botticelli, Pietro Perugino, Cosimo Roselli and their workshops. 

The upper tier is also divided into two and features The Gallery of Popes and Lives. 

In 1515, Raphael was commissioned to design a series of ten tapestries to hang around the lower tier of the wall to depict the life of St Peter and St Paul. 

The works took four years to complete and were looted during the Sack of Rome in 1527. 

In the late 20th century a second set was assembled from other similar copies that had been produced at the time and hung in the chapel from 1983. 

Earlier this year it was revealed that the number of visitors to the Sistine Chapel will be restricted to 6 million a year to protect the delicate frescos.
