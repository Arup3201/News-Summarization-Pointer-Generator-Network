You've heard about the Protein Princesses - women working out 
multiple times per week - but there's a new breed of gym bunnies giving the likes of fitness fanatic Millie Mackintosh a run for her money.

Middle-aged men are forging a new unofficial cult of gym-goers being dubbed MAMILs (middle aged men in lycra), who are becoming obsessed with going to the gym to bulk up.

This breed of over 40s now represent more than one in ten of the nation’s bodybuilders and they're inspired by muscular role models 
including Hugh Jackman, 45, Gerard Butler, 44, and current ‘Hercules’ actor, 42-year-old
Dwayne ‘The Rock’ Johnson.

Is he the MAMIL posterboy? Hugh Jackman, who stars as Wolverine, has inspired a new breed of over 40s who love to bulk up at the gym

A new survey of over 2,000 people who work out regularly found that 40-somethings are the fastest growing age group of people who have taken up bodybuilding in the last 12 months. 

These so-called MAMILs are taking up bodybuilding partly to battle the onset of middle-aged spread (76 per cent), but also as a way to improve their long-term health (66 per cent).

Just under a quarter (23 per cent) say they have taken up bodybuilding as a way to improve their performance in other sports.

The survey also revealed that over a 
third (36 per cent) of these men take daily work out supplements, such 
as protein shakes, to maximise the effectiveness of their workout.

Hugh Jackman, who will reprise his role as Wolverine in Days Of Future Past, told the June issue of Men’s Health about how he prepped before stripping off.

The 45-year-old works out all the time, and it seems he upped the ante before showing off his hunky body in all its glory.

He told 
them: ‘It’s interesting. I’ve been fascinated myself that I don’t want 
to completely do nothing. This morning, including this [photoshoot], 
I’ve trained twice.

‘I’m
 betting that for the next five or 10 years, I’ll still get asked to do 
stuff where I have to be physical. It’s tempting to just go and do yoga,
 or swim, or play tennis. But being skinny, I’ll lose the muscle like 
that. I know how hard it is to get back.’

Hugh added: ‘And by the way, it’s harder
 at 45 than it was at 30. Even now, I’m noticing the weight starting to 
go down. You have to work hard. It sucks.’

Patrick Dempsey, 47, is also an avid gym goer and lifts weights every week, as well as cycling most places.

He's frequently spotted riding, and told Men's Health that he likes to get in about 100 miles a week.

A spokesperson for Bodybuilding Warehouse, who commissioned the survey, said: 'It’s great to see that men aged 40 and above are not viewing their age as an excuse to slow down, but as an extra motivation to look after their fitness and overall well-being.

'Working out four times a week or more is an excellent way to maintain health, prevent middle age spread and maintain a positive mental attitude.'

Health, Physique Transformation and Sports Conditioning Specialist Rich Sturla, Owner and Director of Personal Training at Results Health & Performance, said: ‘It’s brilliant that more and more men over 40 enjoy looking, moving, feeling and performing at their best by exercising regularly. The benefits are wide-ranging and unequivocally backed by science. Here are my top 4 benefits of regular exercise for men over 40.

'Regular exercise increases sexual drive, activity and satisfaction. Physical endurance and muscle tone improve sexual function and exercise jump-starts the sympathetic nervous system, which increases blood flow down-below to keep your ‘equipment’ working properly. Short bouts of intense exercise increase testosterone, which stimulates sexual desire. For example, men over 50 who work out regularly have a 30 per cent lower risk of impotence than those who don't.

'Plus, most people lose 10% of their aerobic capacity each year after the age of 30. However, men who work out regularly have more energy, strength and endurance than non-exercisers.

'Exercising reduces stress and anxiety by diminishing electrical activity in tense muscles, which makes you less hyperactive and jittery. Moreover, your body releases endorphins after you work out which boost your mood and promote relaxation.

'The best reason of all to work out regularly is that it reduces your risk of many serious and potentially deadly diseases, such as heart disease, high blood pressure, osteoporosis, diabetes, obesity, high cholesterol, colon cancer, stroke, heart attack, and arthritis.

Maintain a High Protein Intake - As you age, your ability to digest protein gradually declines, requiring a higher protein intake than you needed when you were younger.

Choose the Right Activities - Find training movements and/or sports that you can do safely, and ideally, succeed at. Switch to using a Buffalo Bar for Squats and Close-Grip or Neutral-Grip Bench Presses instead of wider grips.

Reset Your Expectations - Base your expectations on your current status and rate of progress, not on what you did ‘back in the day’. Sure, always try to beat last year's personal records, but what really counts is what you can do currently.

Restore Optimal Testosterone Levels - Short bouts of high intensity exercise increase testosterone, which has profound effects on energy, recovery, body composition, and overall mood. For the older man, developments in the pharmaceutical field are accelerating at pace here. I'm referring to the increasing use of Testosterone Replacement Therapy (TRT), which is legal, medically supervised, safe, and a lot easier to do than most guys think. Take counsel from an expert in this field before pursuing this route.

Ruthlessly Maximize Training Economy - As we age, it takes longer to recover from workouts and it also takes longer for injuries to heal. Instead of thinking, ‘What else could I do?’ think, ‘Will I really benefit from doing this?’ Make sure that the exercises you choose are safe, effective, and not redundant.

Specialize, But Don't Be ‘Bad’ At Anything - As an older exercise enthusiast, you shouldn't let any physical quality or capacity erode to ‘bad’ levels. Even if you can Deadlift 200kg, it is unacceptable to get winded after climbing a few flights of stairs, or to be unable to touch your toes while maintaining a good back position. If you allow yourself to think or say anything that ends with ‘...for my age’, stop. Don't miss my point - if you’re 40-plus, your body isn't the same as it was in your 20's. It's most certainly different, but not entirely in a bad way. In most respects many can be fitter and more capable than ever.

Prime Yourself to Train - Perform a dynamic mobility warm-up before you train to reduce aches and pains, lengthen typically tight areas and strengthen classically weak areas to prime your body to train. Use this Foam Roller Self-Myofascial Release routine (see video above) to release tension and restore muscle tissue quality across your entire body. Then, perform either of these Two Dynamic Mobility Warm Up routines (see second and third video) before your main workout for peak performance.
