Feyenoord scored an extremely contentious goal that appeared to come straight from a throw-in against Standard Liege in the Europa League on Thursday night.

The controversial incident resulted in the opener for the Dutch side, who went on to win the Group G clash 2-1.

It was officially credited to defender Sven van Beek (wearing 22), but it looked as though it was scored directly from the throw by Miquel Nelom.

The ball was thrown in from Miquel Nelom

And Sven van Beek was credited with the goal although he appeared not to get a touch

The ball travelled all the way through and beat the Standard Liege keeper

According to FIFA's rules of the game 2014-15: 'A goal cannot be scored directly from a throw-in.' 

Therefore, then, it should have been disallowed. 

But the Portuguese referee Manuel de Sousa must have seen something no one else did.

The ball appeared to miss the head of defender Van Beek (right)

But it sneaked all the way through to beat Standard Liege goalkeeper Eiji Kawashima
