The Prince of Wales is urging world leaders to target organised poaching gangs directly and take back their 'ill-gotten gains'.

Charles made the comments in a major speech to the Illegal Wildlife Trade Conference in London - gathered to tackle the threat to endangered animals like tigers, elephants and rhinos.

Joined by his sons the Duke of Cambridge and Prince Harry, the future king told the summit that the scale of the poaching crisis had reached 'unimaginable heights' in certain countries, and there was 'not a moment to lose' to safeguard threatened species.

Prince Charles said Asia's wildlife was also being 'decimated' but steps had been taken to tackle this

The Prince's speech comes as David 
Beckham, The Duke of Cambridge and basketball star Yao Ming released a 
video message urging people around the world not to support the trade in
 rhino horn.

The trio are filmed walking on the pitch at London’s Wembley Stadium surrounded by computer-generated rhinos.

The
 WildAid campaign video tells viewers that the world’s entire rhino 
population could fit inside the stadium, but their numbers could be 
increased by stopping the demand for rhino horn.

Actor Jackie Chan also appeared in a separate video for the charity

In a separate video, actor Jackie Chan warns viewers that buying rhino horn supports the dark side of the trade.

“You’re paying for guns, bullets, poisoned arrows, chainsaws, axes, and machetes to hack off the face of the rhino. And you are paying for the life of a beautiful creature,” he says.

Charles, a long-term campaigner on wildlife conservation, praised the leaders and foreign government ministers for meeting at Lancaster House in London to address the issue.

He said: 'Today, if I may say so, you 
are breaking new ground by coming together and committing - at high 
levels never before seen at a conference on this topic - to take urgent 
action to put a stop to this trade, which has become a grave threat not 
only to the wildlife and the people who protect them, but also to the 
security of nations.

'Next 
month, I hope it will be possible to convene a meeting to encourage 
governments, banks, accounting firms, security agencies and others to 
make greater use of financial tools to tackle organised crime engaged in
 the illegal wildlife trade.

'As
 many experts are telling us, if we 'follow the money' and take back 
organised crime's ill-gotten gains - now done of course to combat 
trafficking in drugs, weapons and people - we can send a strong message 
to criminals that there are serious consequences when they kill 
endangered wildlife for profit.'

Charles told the delegates he played a
 part in helping to bring them together after a group of African 
leaders, including president Ali Bongo Ondimba of Gabon, who is 
attending the conference, contacted him for help.

He
 said: 'The situation they described was indeed dire. The scale of the 
poaching crisis their countries were facing had reached unimaginable 
heights.

'Organised gangs, 
terrorist groups and militia were slaughtering ever greater numbers of 
elephants for their ivory and rhinoceros for their horns. Most 
threatened of all, they said, is the elephant - an integral part of the 
ecological and social fabric of the African continent and a keystone 
species.'

Prince Charles said Asia’s wildlife 
was also being decimated but he gave an example of how successful 
anti-poaching campaigns could have results.

He said: 'Late in the last decade, an 
aggressive public campaign led by WildAid and Chinese athlete Yao Ming -
 combined with government bans on the use of shark fin soup at 
government functions - caused a dramatic drop in public demand for the 
product.'

Prince Charles urged world leaders to target organised poaching gangs directly and take back their 'ill-gotten gains'

The Prince concluded by saying: 'There is not a moment to lose if we are to save species whose loss will not only diminish us all, but also expose their abandoned habitat to ever greater risk of destruction, with dire consequences for humanity.'

Organised gangs, terrorist groups and militia were slaughtering ever greater numbers of elephants for their ivory and rhinoceros for their horns.

Before the day-long conference began 
Charles, William and Harry were shown a display of seized animal parts, 
from a tiger head and skin and rhino horn to bear bile and the skin of a
 Nile crocodile.

Grant Miller, a senior officer with the UK Border Agency, told the royal party about a recent seizure of ivory hidden in 
ball bearing parts and 12 live San Salvador rock iguanas from the 
Bahamas found in the luggage of two passengers stopped at Heathrow 
Airport.

Prime Minister David Cameron was due to speak at the conference but his attendance was cut short so he could focus on the flooding in southern England.

Mr Cameron dropped in at the summit but did not pose with the delegates and the royals for a 'family photo', and met leaders behind the scenes.

It is hoped that the nations will sign a declaration that will commit them to a range of goals to combat poaching and illegal trade in animal parts.

In a short address Foreign Secretary William Hague outlined the steps the conference would agree to take to tackle the 'unprecedented crisis'.

He said there was 'some evidence to show how insurgent or terrorist groups can benefit from the trade' in endangered species, but the conference would result in a 'powerful declaration that will demonstrate to the world that we will not tolerate this abhorrent trade'.

Mr Hague said the countries represented would 'commit ourselves to treat poaching and trafficking as a serious, organised crime in the same category as drugs, arms or people trafficking'.

He said: 'Poachers think they can act with impunity. We will show them they are wrong.'There should be no weak link, we will all seek out those who commit these atrocious acts and use the full force of our national and international laws to break these criminal empires.'

Prince William’s appearance at the summit comes days after he was photographed hunting - a decision described by animal rights campaigners as ‘unfortunate’.

The prince spent the weekend at a Spanish hunting lodge owned by one of the richest men in the country, the Duke of Westminster, shooting wild boar and stag.

He and his brother Harry flew out last Thursday, along with a group of friends including Jecca Craig, whom Prince William is rumoured to have dated in the past.

While the prince’s passion for saving rhinos, elephants and tigers from extinction was praised yesterday, his weekend activities had not escaped the attention of fellow campaigners.

Dame Jane Goodall, a leading British primatologist, said she agreed the prince’s timing was unfortunate, but added: ‘The involvement of Prince William and Prince Charles has brought so much attention and it’s so important, because some of these species are actually vanishing.’
