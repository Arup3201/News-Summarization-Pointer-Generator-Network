Tesco has lost the trust of customers and suffered a failure of leadership, a former boss said today.

Sir Terry Leahy has traded blows with fellow ex-chief Philip Clarke over who was to blame for the problems at the business which were to foreshadow its alarming decline in fortunes.

Sir Terry, who ran Britain's biggest supermarket for 14 years to 2011 - quadrupling annual profits - accused Mr Clarke of a ‘failure of leadership’.

But Mr Clarke, while acknowledging the ‘unprecedented success’ under his predecessor, said ‘critical challenges’ had been building up at the time he took over.

He was shown the exit last summer after overseeing sliding sales and a series of profit warnings that contributed to a dramatic fall in the share price.

Mr Clarke was replaced by Dave Lewis, who earlier this month announced a dramatic shake-up including the closure of dozens of stores, the mothballing of others that were planned, and the sell-off of peripheral businesses.

Sir Terry told the BBC's Panorama that all of the major supermarkets had struggled to some extent during the recession but that it seemed ‘to have hit Tesco the hardest’.

He added: ‘People tried very hard to do the right thing, it clearly has not worked. In the end that's a failure of leadership, not a failure of the business, not a failure of the people who work hard every day in the business.

‘When you're the CEO, if it goes well you get credit, if it doesn't go well you must take responsibility and Phil Clarke has taken that responsibility and paid the price with his job.

‘For whatever reason my successor went in a different direction and I think, it may or may not have been with the right reasons or intentions but it clearly didn't work.

‘The one thing that was missing was this great strength of Tesco to take the pulse of the customer and know what they need today and be prepared to change and innovate in order to respond to customers' needs now.

‘I think the culture did change under Phil Clarke and not for the better. I think if you talked to people who knew Tesco, worked in Tesco when I was there, actually the culture was pretty positive and it has to be.’

He said it was ‘very damaging’ for Tesco to have lost the trust of customers that it would deliver the best price. ‘I think that some of that trust has been eroded which has meant that people have shopped around, not just actually from Tesco.’

Mr Clarke told Panorama: ‘Although the company had enjoyed unprecedented success in the past, it was plainly the case when I took over Tesco in March 2011 that it faced a number of critical challenges which had been building for some time.

‘It was recognised that this involved achieving cultural changes as well as business ones in order to move the business forward.’

Among the legacy issues that Mr Clarke had to deal with during his tenure was the exit from the US Fresh & Easy chain of US stores in 2013, resulting in a £1.2billion charge. The venture had been launched under Sir Terry.

Sir Terry’s comments come as the Panorama investigation claimed that as sales fell at Tesco there was a major fallout between the supermarket and one its biggest suppliers, L’Oreal.

This allegedly led the French cosmetics giant to threaten legal action after a disputed payment of around £1million.

On that allegation, a Tesco spokesman said: 'L’Oreal is the largest cosmetics company in the world, with turnover of €29bn (£22.2billion) generating profits of €3.9bn (£3billion) in 2013. 

'As such it is a major supplier for Tesco in all our markets and we value our relationship with them. Differences do sometimes occur in the course of commercial relationships and we always aim to resolve them amicably, as we did in this case.”

The programme also reported that the former chief financial officer, Laurie McIlwee, sent an internal email in 2012 warning about financial controls at the retailer after problems with commercial income were discovered in its Polish business.

The email told finance staff: ‘You should be in no doubt as to the seriousness [of] mis-declarations.’

This came less than two years before Tesco’s accounting scandal of September 2014 which led to senior staff being suspended and an investigation being launched by the Serious Fraud Office.

ON HIS EMOTIONS OVER THE DECLINE OF TESCO

'I do feel sad, I, I spent my career at Tesco and, I’m particularly sad for the people in the business and actually the customers who come into the stores and, and spend their money every week. It didn’t have to be this way, I don’t think I think all of the big four supermarkets have struggled to some degree through this recession, but it seems to have hit Tesco the hardest.'

ON PHILIP CLARKE

'For whatever reason my successor went in a different direction and I think, it may or may not have been with the right reasons or intentions but it clearly didn’t work and, and the one thing that was missing was this great strength of Tesco to take the pulse of the customer and know what they need today and be prepared to change and innovate in order to respond to customers’ needs now.'

ON FAILURE OF LEADERSHIP

'Well I, look people tried very hard to do the right thing, it clearly has not worked, in the end that’s a failure of leadership, not a failure of the business, not a failure of the people who work hard every day in the business. When you’re the CEO erm, if it goes well you get credit, if it doesn’t go well you must take responsibility and Phil Clarke has taken that responsibility and paid the price with his job.'

ON THE CHANGE OF CULTURE UNDER PHILIP CLARKE

'I think the culture did change under Phil Clarke and not for the better I think if you talked to people who knew Tesco, worked in Tesco when I was there, actually the culture was pretty positive and it has to be because it employs half a million people and you can’t make them do things you have to motivate them to do things, they’ve got to want to do it. They’ve got to believe in something similarly customers you can’t force them to come through your doors, they’ve got to positively choose to come and suppliers to from all over the world, they’ve got to invest in your business and the best way of getting them to do that is to actually motivate them so you need a very positive culture, it has to set high standards of course for safety on behalf of consumers, and also to be fair to good suppliers, you can’t reward a bad supplier and not give the business to a supplier who does things better.'

ON TESCO LOSING ITS REPUTATION FOR HAVING THE BEST PRICES

'It’s very damaging [with reference to Tesco losing its reputation for being the best on price] … Tesco is the biggest, people expect it to have the best prices for the products that they buy - and know they can trust Tesco to deliver that and not have to shop around and check that they’re getting the best deal and, and I think that some of that trust has been eroded which has meant that people have shopped around, not just actually from Tesco but from the other big four supermarkets.'

ON WHETHER TESCO LOST TOO MUCH SENIOR MANAGEMENT TALENT

'I think it lost too much talent, it’s a big company Tesco and also very empowered, people were given responsibility and trusted to get on with their job so there was a big team of experienced leaders and, and too many of those were allowed to go in to short a period of time and so there was, there was a shortage I think of experience, the kind of experience you need to carefully navigate a business like Tesco through this very turbulent and difficult period of this long, long recession with these changes in structure of retailing taking place.'
