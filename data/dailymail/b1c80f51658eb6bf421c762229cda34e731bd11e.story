A Washington mother is suing her third-grader daughter's school because teacher makes the girl urinated on herself after running out of the Monopoly money students 'pay' to use the bathroom.

Students at Mill Plain Elementary, in Vancouver, are given play money to use on bathroom breaks or snacks. The two girls chose in snacks in each instance but then needed the bathroom and the teacher refused them access, parents said.

The two girls ended up in so much pain they have no choice but to just let it happen. Both girls wet their pants while sitting at their desks.

Bewildered parents were at a loss to explain why the accidents happened until the children came clean.

‘My daughter finally told me, ‘We have to pay to use the bathroom.’ Nobody should have to pay to use the bathroom,’ an irate Merchon Ortega told KOIN.

Nine-year-old Lilly Ortega was traumatized by the incident and avoided going to school for fear of ridicule, her mother told Fox News.

‘I didn't let her go to school the rest of the week because she was scared to go to school,’ Ortega lamented. ‘She's scared to be made fun of.’

A classmate of Ortega’s daughter went home last week with wet pants and told her mother a similar story.

Jasmine Alayadhi detailed her daughter’s ordeal to KOIN.

‘I didn’t want to be left out. I wanted to have popcorn with my friends,’ [she said]. And so she tried to hold it. 

‘She said it hurt so bad the pain was so bad – I just had to let it go,’ Alayadhi said.

A school spokesperson defended the controversial program to KOIN saying it is part of the school’s classroom management strategy.

It’s all part of how they manage the classroom and so that was the process decided on,’ said Gail Spolar.

Students are afforded multiple bathroom breaks throughout the day and have never been denied using a restroom in an emergency, Spolar insisted.

‘They have to do something. They have to stop. It’s inhumane. It’s sickening,’ Alayadhu told KOIN.

The teacher has been removed from the classroom while an investigation is conducted, according to the spokesperson, but Ortega isn’t satisfied.

Her daughter has switched classrooms and is doing well, she told Fox News, but a lawsuit against the school is in the works.

‘My next step is hopefully trying to take legal action,’ Ortega told the network. ‘[My daughter] has got to go to counseling because it's really messed with her emotions.’
