BBC executives may have deliberately misled the official inquiry into the Jimmy Savile scandal, its author has claimed.

Speaking publicly for the first time since his £2.4million report was published, Nick Pollard admitted he failed to get to the bottom of the affair because those involved repeatedly claimed they were unable to remember key events.

The former Sky News chief told Radio 4’s Media Show he thought the excuses were ‘not completely [credible]’.

The Pollard review was set up last year to investigate allegations that Newsnight scrapped an investigation into Savile’s paedophile activities in November 2011 to avoid clashing with a Christmas tribute programme following his death.

Among those questioned was former director general George Entwistle, who repeatedly said he was unable to remember important exchanges.

Former deputy news director Steve Mitchell was castigated in the report for being ‘exceptionally vague’.

In all, the document contained 45 references to BBC executives claiming they were unable to recall important episodes.

Mr Pollard admitted: ‘We didn’t, I think, get absolutely to the point where we could say with 100 per cent assurance, “This is precisely what happened, and why”. [That was] partly because of conflicting recollections by people, or no recollections offered to us.’

A BBC spokesman said the report’s findings had been accepted and there was nothing further to add.
