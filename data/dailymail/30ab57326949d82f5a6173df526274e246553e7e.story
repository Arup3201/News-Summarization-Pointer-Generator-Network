For Andrea Pirlo this is a swansong. After this World Cup, he will retire from international football. ‘I’ll be hanging up my heart,’ he said, when he unveiled this plan.

It is a final chance to savour his effortless poise on this stage. For England, it is  perhaps the last time they will be forced to dance to his tune.

Pirlo was 35 in May; a year older than Steven Gerrard, a year younger than Frank Lampard. He has signed a two-year deal at Juventus, where he has added three Serie A titles in as many years to two won in a decade at AC Milan.

Last hurrah: Andrea Pirlo will quit international football after the World Cup

Talking tactics: Pirlo chats with Mario Balotelli and Italy's head coach Cesare Prandelli

The deal was confirmed on Wednesday and those who watched him in Turin last season will tell you the maestro just gets better with age.

He breezed into Casa Azzurri, Italy’s World Cup nerve centre, on Wednesday like Captain Jack Sparrow dressed by Puma, albeit somewhat more carefully groomed.

Heavily bearded with a flowing mane, he was tanned and weathered, with trinkets and jewels tied to his right wrist and a footballer’s watch perched on his left.

Unhurried 
and utterly at ease, as in possession of the football, he shrugged and 
tugged at his beard, refused to deny Tottenham had tried to lure him to 
London and promised he would do his utmost to summon a performance like 
the one against England in Euro 2012.

‘This is one of my targets, to play like I played in Kiev,’ he smiled.

Danger man: Pirlo was a thorn in England's side at Euro 2012

‘To control the game and help my team win.’ Even at 35? Even in the suffocating humidity predicted for Manaus? Even on a pitch that looks like a terrible quilted blanket?

‘The temperature will be a problem for everyone. We have been preparing in Italy, before we came to Brazil. The pitch will be a problem for everyone. It is important to make the ball roll.

‘England is a great team who is much better now. They have young players, who run a lot, very physical, but we know how to face them. We are studying them. Italy always does well against England.’

Since winning the World Cup in 2006, Pirlo has become one of the team’s spiritual leaders as well as being recognised as one of his generation’s finest playmakers.

Practice makes perfect: Pirlo has modelled his free-kick technique on Brazilian Juninho Pernambucano

At the Italian training camp on Wednesday he was met by Juninho Pernambucano, the Brazilian free-kick expert who played for eight years at Lyon.

Pirlo studied his dead-ball technique until he had unlocked the secret and presented Juninho with a No 21 Italy shirt signed ‘with respect and gratitude’. In return he took  possession of two No 8 shirts, Juninho’s number, in the colours of Brazil and Vasco da Gama.

Italy manager Cesare Prandelli has compared Pirlo’s calm authority to that of Gaetano Scirea, an Italy and Juventus legend who was killed in a car crash in 1989. Prandelli’s predecessor Marcelo Lippi called Pirlo his ‘silent leader’.

Yet the midfielder is not expected to be allowed to perform in his preferred position, sitting on the toes of the centre halves. Italy are too concerned with their defensive frailties and Prandelli will ask Daniele De Rossi to protect the back four.

Limbering up: Balotelli, Pirlo and Daniele De Rossi prepare to face England

Pirlo and Marco Verratti, the 21-year-old heir apparent to Pirlo’s crown, will sit either side of De Rossi, with Claudio Marchisio and Antonio Candreva ahead of them in a five-man midfield.

They trained this way on Wednesday, with Mario Balotelli the lone striker, with only one goal since March and at the centre of a ‘should he start’ debate in the Italian media, similar to the one that has swirled around Wayne Rooney.

‘We are trying new solutions,’ said Pirlo. ‘We like to have one in front of the defence and two closer to the opposing goal free to invent. The most important thing is not the position but your interpretation of the position.’

When the English reporters pursued details of his new role, he flashed his teeth again. ‘I am not going to make it easy for you,’ he said. ‘We have 23 players, all good choices. Italy do not depend only on me. If every player can shine for 10 minutes it will be enough.’

All smiles: Pirlo jokes around with Balotelli in training on Wednesday

Italian newspaper La Stampa wrote of ‘England’s obsession’ with Pirlo, since that date in Kiev, when they danced to his tune.

‘The important thing is to play as a group, as we did in 1982 and 2006,’ he said. ‘We are here to win, of course. We always play to win. I am never happy just to pass the group stage. We are competitive. We want to go to the end.’

Twenty years after Romanian coach Mircea Lucescu threw him into the Brescia team at the age of 15 and offended the rest of the squad by ordering them to ‘give the ball to Pirlo, he knows how to look after it’, he will bow out of international football.

Well, probably. He will find it hard. In his book, he wrote emotionally about playing for his country and how he stood over his penalty during the 2006 World Cup final at one with every Italian. 

Chasing shadows: England players couldn't get near Pirlo in Kiev

‘Being part of a team that belongs to everyone makes me feel good and at peace with myself,’ he wrote in I Think Therefore I Play. ‘It relaxes me. A lot of the time, it’s better than sex: it lasts longer and if it all falls flat, it can’t just be your fault.

‘Take someone like Antonio Cassano. He says he’s slept with 700 women in his time but he doesn’t get picked for Italy any more. Deep down, can he really be happy? I certainly wouldn’t be. It makes you better, takes you to a higher level. Much better to be a soldier on the pitch than in the bedroom.’

When asked again if international retirement is still his intention, he replied: ‘Yes. I am going to give space to the youngsters but if they need me I will be at their disposal, and if I come I will want to play. Otherwise I will be nervous.’
