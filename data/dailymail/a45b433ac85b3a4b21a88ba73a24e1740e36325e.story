Furious: Military veteran Michael Matwyuk, 57, is suing the state of Michigan for violating his fee speech rights after rejecting his request for 'infidel' personalized license plates

A 57-year-old army veteran is suing the state for rejecting his request for a personalized license plate based on the word 'infidel'.

Michael Matwyuk, a combat soldier in the Iraq war, has accused the state of Michigan of violating his free speech rights after denying his application for 'INFDL' or 'INF1DL' plates.

While he considered the word a 'badge of pride', the state insists it 'might carry a connotation offensive to 
good taste or decency', which is illegal in Michigan.

Matwyuk was deployed to Iraq in 2004 and 2005 with an engineer detachment 
and was hurt in Fallujah. He reportedly suffered brain injuries and hearing loss during combat.

According to the lawsuit, filed in Grand Rapids yesterday by The
American Civil Liberties Union of Michigan, Matwyuk and fellow U.S. soldiers embraced the word infidel - even tattooing it on their bodies - after insurgents constantly used it to insult them.

'We embraced it, we joked about it, we laughed about it, we called each other ‘infidel,’ ' Matwyuk, from Kingston, Michigan,  told Army Times.

'We’re
infidels, we’re absolutely that and we were there who did not subscribe
to the doctrine or belief system [the enemy] was trying to impose.

'We don’t subscribe to terrorism, Shariah
law and oppression. We are champions of freedom, and if that makes us 
infidels good for me and good for the rest of us.'

Matwyuk said he applied for the plate on the Secretary of State website late last year.

His first request - INFIDL - was denied, but the website accepted his second request, INF1DL, according to MLive.com.

However the state refused to issue the plate, saying it might contravene a Michigan statute banning plates that might cause offense.

While the state allows plates that express various religious sentiments, it does not allow plates with offensive connotations.

In a letter to Matwyuk, a department manager allegedly said the word infidel can be offensive 'because of the way it’s being used by radical elements', according to Army Times.

Rejected: Michael Matwyuk applied for the personalized plates on the Secretary of State website late last year but was rejected

Fred Woodhams, a spokesman for the Michigan Secretary of State, said he could not comment on specifics of the lawsuit because the Department of State had not yet reviewed it.

'We believe we have a well-established, long-standing process that balances a person’s desire to express themselves with the department’s obligation under state law to not allow plates that might be considered offensive,' Woodhams told Army Times.

However Matwyuk insists he wasn't trying to offend anyone, as the word simply means non-believer, like the word atheist.

'It was because people overseas are saying, ‘Death to infidels.’ So who are we going to offend? Them?' Matwyuk said.

'They tried to kill me for a year, so I’m not worried about offending them. I already did.'

Matwyuk claims in his suit that the ban is unconstitutional, violating his rights under the First
and Fourteenth Amendments.

The suit argues the state law is 'unconstitutionally overbroad, vague and content-based, meaning it 
allows some words, but denies others based solely on their message.'

'As a way to cope, we decided to take this word — meant to hurt and demean us — as our own,' Matwyuk said in a statement distributed by the ACLU.

'It’s a point of pride and patriotism that many of us identify with, just as we would identify with the word ‘soldier.’ This license plate is simply an expression of my service as an Iraqi combat veteran.'
