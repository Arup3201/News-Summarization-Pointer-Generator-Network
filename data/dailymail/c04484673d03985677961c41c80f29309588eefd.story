Although we have witnessed hundreds of super slim models looking fabulous whilst parading the catwalks this weekend at London Fashion Week, forget size zero and extreme dieting because female slimmers want a body just like curvaceous Kelly Brook.

The brunette actress and model, 32, was crowned ‘Miss Body Perfect’ by a new survey where almost a quarter of voters said she was their number one choice.

The curvy model was followed by singer Rihanna (14 per cent), ex Friends star Jennifer Aniston (10 per cent), popstar Cheryl Cole (8.05 per cent) and US reality TV star Kim Kardashian (7.45 per cent).

It's actress and model Kelly Brook who won the votes for the perfect figure, leaving Victoria Beckham trailing behind

Super skinny Victoria Beckham – who was photographed last week with Vogue editor Anna Wintour, in an elegant tangerine dress that created the illusion of curves - won less than one per cent of the vote.

However, despite this there was still cause for celebration in the Beckham household, as husband David was named owner of the hottest male celeb body.

A third of women voted father–of-four David’s body the best, one in ten opted for movie legend George Clooney and X Factor supremo Simon Cowell was the surprise third place choice, with 8 per cent of the vote.

The 52-year-old British TV star beat a long list of, much younger, Hollywood leading men, including Twilight star Robert Pattinson (5.15 per cent), screen idol Orlando Bloom (5.95 per cent) and all action hero Jason Statham (6.55 per cent).

David Beckham took the crown for the men with Simon Cowell coming in a surprising third place

And pop music mogul Cowell was even more popular with women under 35, with over a fifth of women in this age range insisting he was their ‘Mr Body Perfect’.

Speaking about the results of the poll, Linda O’Byrne, chief nutritionist for the New Atkins Diet, who OnePoll carried out the research for, said: 'It’s great that women in the UK are looking to celebrities with real curves for inspiration, as it provides an achievable weight loss goal.

'The trend for size zero and extreme dieting was very unhealthy and worrying, so it is very reassuring to discover, thanks to our research, that women are beginning to adopt a healthier attitude to losing weight and using better role models.

'Kelly Brook has a fantastic figure, and now it seems that it is no longer just men that appreciate it. It is also very easy to understand why so many women voted David Beckham the perfect body, he has it all.

'And while Simon Cowell has a certain charisma, it was something of a surprise to discover just how popular he is with women under 35.'

Cheryl Cole and Rihanna were in the top five females voted with having the best body

The study also discovered that women were most conscious of their tummies (55.85per cent), followed by legs (16.80 per cent) and then their bum (11.50 per cent).

Worryingly, a fifth of those under 35 confessed that they had first started dieting at the tender age of 11, and almost a third of ladies in this age range said they were always on a diet.

Chocolate was voted the hardest thing to avoid when dieting, with four out of ten women agreeing, followed by carbs, such as pasta and bread (17.25 per cent) and thirdly, alcohol (15 per cent).

Meanwhile, one in four told researchers they were most likely to break their diet and comfort eat at this time of year, as autumn arrives and the weather turns colder.

Linda O’Byrne, chief nutritionist for the New Atkins Diet, added: 'It is a fact that when slimming, many women do try and fail numerous diets and also often find themselves blindsided by temptation or seasonal changes, such as colder weather setting in during autumn or an abundance of parties at Christmas time.'
