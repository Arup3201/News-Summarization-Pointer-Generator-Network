Lawrence Taylor was handed a six-year sentence on probation, and registered on the sex offenders' list

Lawrence Taylor, one of the most venerated American footballers in history, should have been slung in jail, according to an underage he paid to have sex with.

The 52-year-old former New York Giants linebacker - a double Super Bowl winner - changed his plea and admitted to soliciting sex with teenager Christina Fierro last year, but 'LT' was handed only a six-year sentence on probation.

The young women, now 18, spoke out - via her lawyer, Gloria Allred - at a news conference in New York, and expressed outrage at what she views as a derisory punishment.

She was found to have been the victim of sex trafficking, and thinks that Taylor's sentence 'sends out the wrong signal'.

Though Taylor was also made to have his name inked on the sex offenders' register, she believes that the former NFL player 'should have been sentenced to jail time - not probation - for the crimes he committed'.

A statement read out by Mrs Allred outside Federal Court in New York said: 'Christina and I were appalled that he [Taylor] was permitted to enter the plea that he did.

'Even the district attorny himself told the press that Christina was a sex trafficiking victim, not a prostitute.

'Yet Taylor was permitted to enter the plea and as a result Christina has been wrongly characterised by the press.

'Also Christina felt that Taylor should have been sentenced to jail time - not probation - for the crimes that he committed against her.

'Sentencing him to probation sends out the wrong message to the buyers who provide the profit to commecial sex traffickers who sell the bodies of children for sex.'

The teen, who said that pimp Rasheed Davis beat her and forced her to have sex with clients, said herself: 'I am a human being and I am hurting for what they did.'

Taylor, who has a history of drink and drugs problems, pleaded guilty to sexual misconduct and soliciting a prostitute.

He has a checked past and two years ago was arrested in Miami-Dade County, Florida, after leaving the scene of an accident having hit another vehicle with his Cadillac Escalade.

He had already committed a similar offense in 1996 when he wrote off his Lexus in an accident which involved one other car before leaving the scene of the crime.

On that occasion he argued that he did not think the law required the reporting of a single driver incident.

He was released on a $500 bond, and the other driver later sued him, seeking $15,000.

He was arrested six months later for having sex at Rockland County Holiday Inn with a 16-year-old girl - Miss Fierro.

He was charged with felony third-degree statutory rape, for allegedly engaging in sexual intercourse with someone under 17 and charged with third-degree patronisation for allegedly paying the underage girl $300 to have sex with him.

He had faced up to five years in prison and lifetime sex offender registration if convicted of both crimes. On June 23, 2010, Taylor was indicted on these charges, and pleaded not guilty on July 13.

On January 13 this year Taylor pleaded guilty to some of the charges thereby resolving the case.

In March he was sentenced to six years probation as part of a plea agreement, which saw him plead guilty to the misdemeanours of sexual misconduct and patronising a prostitute.

Rasheed Davis, 37, who pleaded guilty to a charge of sex trafficking, was sentenced to seven years in jail after setting up 16-year-old Miss Fierro with Lawrence Taylor.

He had allegedly tried to bribe the teen and wrote: 'Let me know what LT gave you; I will give you more to help reduce my time.'

Miss Fierro said in court: 'It has been a nightmare that should have never happened to me and it should never happen to any other teenage girl.

'We are not pieces of property to be bought or sold. I am a human being, and I am hurting because of what they did.'

In court Davis told the teen: 'I'm sorry I put you all through this again; its going to be another long ride. I'm sorry for the pain I caused you, mentally and physically. I should have never put you in this position.'

Two men accused of brutally beating a San Francisco Giants fan outside Dodger Stadium pleaded not guilty yesterday.

The pleas were made in spite of the fact that prosecutors said they had made admissions in the well-publicised case.

Louie Sanchez, 28, and Marvin Norwood, 30, entered their pleas during a brief arraignment to charges of mayhem and assault and battery in the March 31 attack of Bryan Stow, a Santa Cruz paramedic who suffered severe brain injuries and remains hospitalised.

Prosecutor Frank Santoro said in court he did not object to a motion to allow television cameras in the courtroom because the case is built on admissions, not witness identifications.

'The case is based on admissions from both of them,' said Santoro, who provided no further details.
