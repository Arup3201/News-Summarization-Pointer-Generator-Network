An airman paralysed by a Taliban bomb has stunned doctors by taking his first steps in two years - thanks to futuristic ‘Robocop’ legs.

Lance Corporal Kevin Ogilvie, 24, was told he would never walk again when his armoured vehicle hit an improvised explosive device (IED) in Afghanistan in 2012.

While his colleagues suffered burns and broken bones, the father-of-one took the full force of the blast and was paralysed from the chest down.

Lance Corporal Kevin Ogilvie was paralysed when an bomb exploded by his armoured vehicle in Afghanistan in September 2012. He was paralysed from the chest down and was told he would never walk again

But now, the ex-gunner has defied expectations by taking his first steps thanks to a prototype 'exo-skeleton' controlled by a joystick.

Lance Corporal Ogilvie said: ‘It was really cool, but also really strange, to be walking again after so long.

‘It was weird to use, but weird in a good sense, having no feeling or control below my chest made seeing me moving even weirder.’

Lance Corporal Ogilvie, from Lowestoft, Suffolk, was critically injured while on patrol with the Scotland-based 51 Squadron, an RAF regiment, in September 2012.

He was immediately evacuated home where he was met by his wife Aimee and two-year-old daughter, Grace.

Doctors did not think he would make it back to the UK alive, but he soon set about defying their expectations.

Lance Corporal Ogilvie, who was on his second tour of duty in Afghanistan, in a ground-based role securing airfields, said: ‘I was six weeks lying on my front in a hospital bed.

‘I wasn't allowed to move at all because my spine was so badly broken - I thought I would go mad with boredom.

‘When they eventually brought me a wheelchair I can't explain just how eager I was to get into it and get about again.

‘At first, I thought the world had ended. It really knocked my self-confidence.

Lance Corporal Ogilvie said: 'It was really cool, but also really strange, to be walking again after so long'

‘But I think my experiences have changed me for the better. You realise what is important in life and I've been able to spend more time with my family than I ever could before.’

The futuristic bionic 'exo-skeleton' is a prototype made by New Zealand-based company Rex Bionics and while it is still in development, it is thought Lance Corporal Ogilvie could be using it full-time in a few years.

It is strapped tightly to his legs and around his waist and moves his legs as he moves the joystick to control the speed and direction of movement.

His father Phil, 62, said: ‘The device is still in the development stage but it's hoped that in four or five years it will be fully operational.

‘Kevin thinks it is just great, he says he feels like Robocop when he uses it.

The 'exo-skeleton' is only a prototype but Lance Corporal Ogilvie hopes he will eventually be able to use it full-time when it is fully operational and available

‘There is definitely hope on the horizon.’

The family are hoping to raise £10,000 to thank the RAF Benevolent Fund and the Soldiers' and Sailors' Families Association, who helped Lance Corporal Ogilvie through his darkest days.

He said: ‘You hear about these charities as a serviceman, but you never really appreciate the phenomenal help they provide until you need it.

‘They helped me and my family so much I want to do everything I can for them in return.’
