Sebastian Vettel now has 40 victories in his grand prix career, which is just one behind the legendary Brazilian Ayrton Senna though the German has achieved the feat in 21 fewer races. 

His triumph for Ferrari ends a 34-race winless drought for the famous constructor. 

Their last victory came at the Spanish Grand Prix in May 2013 when Fernando Alonso triumphed in front of his home crowd.

Alonso, who ended his five-year relationship with Ferrari to join McLaren, retired from the race with a cooling problem after only 21 laps as his troubled start to the season continued. 

Team-mate Jenson Button’s race also didn’t last the distance. This meant McLaren did not have a classified car for the first time since the 2006 United States Grand Prix, some 158 races ago.

Max Verstappen became Formula One’s youngest points scorer after he finished seventh. At just 17 years and 180 days, he eclipsed Russian Daniil Kvyat’s record by exactly two years. 

And now with the rules preventing any driver under 18 to be given a super licence, Verstappen’s record will probably never be broken.

Alonso left Ferrari under a cloud last season and Vettel’s win for the Italian constructors appeared to attract much amusement from the Lotus team. They tweeted: ‘We wonder if the TV channel has been changed in a certain Spanish driver’s room right now?’, as Vettel was presented with the winner’s trophy.
