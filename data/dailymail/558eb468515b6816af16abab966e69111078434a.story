A driver had to be rescued after getting his car stuck in the mud - and then could only watch as the tide came in and swamped it.

Stephen Cooper, 34, had driven his car along the beach at Weston Shore in Southampton, Hants, when it got stuck at 4.30pm yesterday.

Mr Cooper, 34, from Eastleigh, Hants, was looking for a spot to fish when his 20-year-old Mitsubishi Pajero fell in a hole on the shingle beach.

Submerged: The 4x4 sunk on the shingle beach before the tide came in and quickly swallowed the vehicle, causing extensive damage

Off road: Driver Stephen Cooper had been looking for a spot to fish when his Mitsubishi Pajero became stuck in a hole on a beach in Southampton and the tide came in 

As the tide came in, he was taken to safety by Hill Head Coastguard and Hampshire Fire and Rescue Service but the car was left in the water.

The self employed plasterer said around £1,500 worth of damage was done to the vehicle.

People came from as far away from Portsmouth to help - once the tide went out at 10.30pm - six hours later, despite advice from the Coastguard.

Stephen said: 'I'm angry and upset that it happened.

'I phoned up a guy I know who said he would come and help and then loads of other people said they were on their way.

'It's brilliant that everyone came to help.'

To the rescue: Another 4x4 is used to tow the Mitsubishi out of the water after it became stuck on a Southampton beach and the tide came in

Five vehicles arrived at the shore to try to drag the car to safety but Solent Coastguard said only professional recovery teams should rescue a car from the water.

A spokesman said: 'We would be concerned for the safety of any persons in or entering the water and we would urge anyone who sees a vehicle going into the water to dial 999 and ask for the coastguard.

'We would urge anyone thinking of attempting to recover their vehicle from the water to seek professional recovery and not attempt to enter the water.'
