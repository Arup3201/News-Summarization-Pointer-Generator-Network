Back in the 1970s and 1980s, a Wendy house consisted of 16 plastic tubes and a wad of brightly coloured material with windows and a door printed on. 

These days, the buildings are made of solid wood, with functioning windows, lighting and even colour schemes.  

But these young people's palaces don't come cheap.

The two-storey properties are built by a company in Pennsylvania called Lilliput Homes 

The buildings are designed for kids aged three to ten years old

These elaborate Wendy houses for toddlers modelled on castles and Victorian houses are on sale for $20,000 (£12,770).

The unbelievably detailed models come with Roman pillars, slides and even castle turrets.

Amazingly, some of the houses can even be hooked up to electrical mains and come with fully operable doors and windows.

The mini-dwellings, designed for kids aged three to ten years old, are nearly double the price of Britain's cheapest two-up two-down property.

In April, a house in Gainsborough, Lincolnshire was put up for sale at an asking price of £7,000 ($11,000).

Stephen Chernicky, owner of Lilliput Play Homes, said: 'Twenty years ago, my wife and I searched for a playhouse for our daughter, Alyssa, but were unable to discover a product special enough for our little girl.

'Soon after we created the first Victorian Mansion playhouse and Lilliput Play Homes was born.

'We take personal pride in every wooden playhouse that our company creates.'

He continued: 'We share the feeling of our customers, that children should have a special place of their own to grow and discover.'

If operable windows, doors and electricity isn't enough, Lilliput even give the option to customise the colour schemes inside the houses. 

In fact, with prices on the property market going through the roof in much of the UK, it wouldn't be too surprising if cash-strapped twenty-somethings start snapping up the buildings as an alternative to bricks and mortar.
