If the art of apple peeling was an Olympic sport then one innovative restaurant worker, who posted a video on YouTube of his lightening quick technique, would surely be in line for a gold medal.

The American man has posted a YouTube video showing his novel way of skinning apples - using a power drill.

The 49 second video shows the man holding a drill in his left hand and a peeler in his right hand and working his way through a basket of apples at lightning speed.

The average time he spends peeling one apple is approximately five seconds and he flies through about half a dozen apples in just over 33 seconds.

The man dumps the large peels into a nearby bucket as he finishes peeling each apple. The restaurant owner can also be heard telling a woman who filmed the footage to 'show them how long the peels are'.

The speedy worker stretches out one of the peels and to show it reaching about two feet long.
