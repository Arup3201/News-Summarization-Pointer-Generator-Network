Competing on new soil is already daunting for athletes, but just to make sure our competitors know the home country has the advantage a giant painting of British World Champion Jessica Ennis has been created next to the flight path at Heathrow airport.

From today millions of passengers flying into the airport will be able to see the giant image of the 2012 heptathlon hopeful alongside the words 'Welcome to our turf.'

It is located in Thornbury 
Playing Fields in Hounslow, west London, about three miles from Heathrow.

Work of art: The creation needed over 600 litres of red, white and blue weatherproof paint and it took two days for the painters to complete

World Champion: Jessica Ennis, who said she was thrilled to be the first face passengers will see as they arrive at Heathrow for the Games

The creation needed over 600 
litres of red, white and blue weatherproof paint and it took two 
days for the painters to complete.

It
will be visible to passengers in the run up to the Games, including 
July 16 which is the date when most of the competing athletes will arrive 
into London.

Measuring 53 by 75 metres (173ft x 246ft) the image is bigger than 15 tennis courts.

It is painted from a photo taken of Ennis wearing the Great Britain kit designed by Stella McCartney.

Jessica Ennis, said: 'I'm 
thrilled to be the first face that people will see arriving into the UK 
for the London 2012 Games.

'I hope it brings excitement to homecoming Brits, and reminds international athletes that we’re ready and prepared!'

'We have the most dedicated fans in the world, who will get behind us every step of the way to give us a home advantage.'

Former
American Olympic rower Kate Johnson, believes the giant work of art could prove both amusing and unsettling for the competitors:

'As an athlete at the Athens
Games in 2004, one of my strongest memories was seeing the city for the
first time as we flew in, because that’s when the reality kicked in.

'It’s
an exciting and anxious moment for athletes, and I expect they will be 
amused and a perhaps a little unsettled to see such a bold message as 
they arrive to the UK.'

British
Airways sponsorship manager, Luisa Fernandez, said: 'Whether you’re a 
Brit coming home, or an athlete arriving in for the London 2012 Games, 
this celebratory message reminds us all of the power of the home crowd 
and how important it is to get behind Team GB and ParalympicsGB.'

Jessica Ennis continued her preparations for this summer's Olympics with victory in the long jump at the Bedford International Games on Sunday.

The European heptathlon champion jumped 6.40 metres to take the triumph just ahead of Dominique Blaize (6.39m).

Ennis recently confirmed she will be competing in four events during the Olympic trials in Birmingham next month, taking part in the100 metre hurdles and high jump on Saturday, June 23 and in the long jump and 200m the following day.

The 2009 heptathlon world champion said: 'The Aviva trials is a great opportunity for me to just polish up on a few events. I'm used to doing seven events every two days, so it will be nice just to do two events on each of the days.'
