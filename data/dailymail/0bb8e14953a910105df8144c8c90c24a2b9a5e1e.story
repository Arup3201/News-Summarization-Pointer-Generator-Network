A lawyer for a Native American man who claims the letters 'KKK' were carved into his stomach during surgery has filed a federal civil rights lawsuit against the hospital where the operation took place, its board of directors and others.

YouTube videos featuring 69-year-old Vern Traversie, a Lakota man who lives on the Cheyenne River Reservation, went viral in Native American communities earlier this year.

In them, Traversie talks about being mistreated at the South Dakota hospital and shows his abdomen. Though he himself is blind, Traversie says he was told by others that the scars left after his heart surgery form the letters.

Racism: Vernon Traversie speaks on the video about the maltreatment he claims he received at the Rapid City Regional Hospital because he is a Native American

A May rally in support of Traversie 
drew hundreds of people, many of whom said his story exemplifies the 
racism Native Americans experience in Rapid City.

But others say they can't make out 
the letters, including police who investigated his allegations and 
hospital officials. No criminal charges have been filed in the case.

Chase Iron Eyes, a lawyer for 
Traversie, filed a lawsuit on Monday in U.S. District Court in South 
Dakota against Rapid City Regional Hospital, its board of directors, 
physicians and TRS Surg Assist Inc.

The lawsuit alleges a civil rights 
violation based on race and cites the scarring from Traversie's 
double-bypass surgery done in August 2011 as evidence. It seeks a jury 
trial and damages.

'Defendants injured, carved, burned, 
and/or cared for Plaintiff's abdomen in such a manner that scars 
resembling three letters "K" were permanently placed on Plaintiff's 
abdomen for no medically necessary purpose or reason, and in the process
injured, carved, burned, and/or cared for other portions of Plaintiff's
body to cause injury, specifically his abdomen and back,' the lawsuit 
stated.

Tim Sughrue, chief executive of Rapid
City Regional Hospital, said in a statement that the hospital will 
'vigorously defend this claim'.

'We at Rapid City Regional Hospital 
are confident the care we provide meets or exceeds standards of care and
is without bias or consideration of race, religion, color, age, sex, 
disability, national origin, or any other classification protected by 
law,' he said.

Hospital: Rapid City police say they conducted an investigation into the care Mr Traversie received but found no evidence of a crime and will vigorously defend the suit

Traversie said he hadn't been aware 
the lawsuit was filed on Monday, although he knew a lawyer was planning 
to file one at some point on his behalf.

'I think the Native people have been 
fighting racial hatred for many years in South Dakota, but you know, 
it's not all the people that are hateful toward Native Americans,' said 
Traversie, who recently had another heart surgery in Bismarck, North Dakota.

'We have a good segment of our 
society -- white society -- in South Dakota that are Christian people 
and they get along good with the Native Americans. In my instance, I 
believe I'm dealing with the Ku Klux Klan, and that's a small minority.'

As well as the marks on his skin, he 
said the staff was also abusive towards him and when he told them how 
much pain he was in, no one did anything to help him.

'I had a confrontation 
with a male nurse while I was in intensive care,' he said. 'I was in so 
much pain, I begged him for pain medication.

'He told me to shut my f***ing mouth or he’d shut it for me. I didn’t provoke him. I didn’t disrespect him.'

When he asked to be sent to a 
rehabilitation center because the pain was so bad, they said this was 
approved - but instead discharged him.

On
the day he was discharged, a nurse at the hospital told Mr Traversie 
that he should get someone to take a picture of the surgery scars on his
stomach and his back.

The nurse said she would not testify on his behalf but couldn't live with herself without at least alerting him to the scars.

She
said to him: 'My conscience won’t let me be. It’s bothered me for days.
Something was done to you, and I believe it was wrong.

'I can’t sleep. I keep thinking about what they did to you.'

Scars: Mr Traversie had an old wound reopened on his back and two more cuts above it. On his abdomen the letters K can be seen

Point out: A YouTube video made about his story shows where the K letters are for those who do not recognize them. It was a nurse who first alerted Mr Traversie to the scars

He told the Indian Country Today Media Network after the operation: 'You can see the surgery sutures, and they’re clean.

'But
those three letters, two good-sized Ks and one smaller one off to the 
side, had to be made with some sharp knife or heated instrument. It’s 
like they branded me.'

Iron Eyes, a member of the Standing 
Rock Sioux Tribe, and Cody Hall, a member of the Cheyenne River Sioux 
Tribe, which Traversie belongs to, organized the May rally in an effort 
to bring attention to what they say is continued mistreatment of Native 
American people. Iron Eyes declined to comment about the lawsuit.

While Traversie's story spurred the 
protest, many Native Americans who attended referred to broken treaties,
unsolved murders and incarceration rates among Native Americans as 
their reasons for showing up.

They included Dennis Banks, who 
helped found the American Indian Movement in the late 1960s to protest 
the U.S. government's treatment of Indians and demand the government 
honor its treaties with Indian tribes.

South Dakota Attorney General Marty 
Jackley said on Tuesday that his office would release information in the
'near future' about its investigation.

A friend of the 69-year-old who made a
YouTube video about the case, said they also cut down through an 
existing surgery scar and carved two vertical lines above the older 
scar.

The hospital have attributed the extra wounds to surgical tape or to infections related to his diabetes. 

A Justice for Traversie Facebook page has been set up to highlight what happened, as has an online petition.
