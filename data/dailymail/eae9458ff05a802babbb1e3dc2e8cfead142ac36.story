Twenty photos taken on the humble mobile phone have been shortlisted for a new category in the world's largest photography completion. They include this shot, called Alone in the Pool, which was shot in Italy and seems to be created using two images

The World Photo Organisation (WPO) launched its new award to recognise excellent photographs taken on smartphones in January and has now shortlisted 20 entries.

The images were chosen by a panel of judges from over 10,000 photographs in just four weeks.

Members of the public can vote their favourite in the next week by visiting the WPO’s website before March 17, when voting closes. 

The image with the most ‘thumbs up’ will win a trip to London to attend the Sony World Photography Awards gala ceremony on 23 April and the photographer will have their photo shown at an exhibition at Somerset House, as well as winning Sony goodies.

The World Photo Organisation (WPO) launched its new award to recognise excellent photographs taken on smartphones in January and has now shortlisted 20 entries. This striking image shot in Stuttgart's Stadtbibliothek and simply called Library, is one of them. The picture was taken with a Samsung S3 phone.The inspiration came from the design of this library and people who live their life in different stages

Members of the public can vote their favourite photograph in the next week by visiting the WPO’s website before March 17, when voting closes. The image on the left is called Pilgrim and is thought to have been taken in Iran. The photograph on the right, is called Secret thoughts and was shot in Portugal. The photographer wanted to capture a girl who loves water and secrets

Incredible images show natural wonders such as the fjords in Norway (pictured) and mysterious misty landscapes as well as humerous scenes showing everyday life. This majestic picture is called On the Edge Known and shows a snowy Preacher´s Pulpit or Preikestolen, which is in 604 metres above sea level

Some photographs, such as an image of a swimming pool with a man standing inside it, use apps and visual trickery to superimpose shots over each other, while others show more ‘simple' scenes such as a girl on a swing, or men praying.

There are two shortlisted entries from British photographers. Helen Welton shot a bridge disappearing into mist, while Craig Atkinson captured his two children clasping hands wearing their best clothes at a family event, choosing black and white for the image.

The dizzying image of Preacher´s Pulpit or Preikestolen, in Norway, was taken by Atle Rønningen.

'For me having a person in my landscape photos increases the value, not only as it gives scale to the scene but because it also gives the image valuable memories,' he told MailOnline.

'My friend has no fair of heights so he was willing to go very far to the edge. 

I also had to go far out on the other side to get the right angle, and admit that I felt a bit dizzy'.

He took the incredible shot with his smartphone and edited it with a free app called VSCO Cam. Photo manipulation is allowed in the competition. 

The 20 shortlisted images were chosen by a panel of judges, including experts from the Wall Street Journal and National Geographic Traveller. This comical scene, entitled 'A Day on the Beach' was taken in Italy

'For me photo processing has to be simple and done quickly, and I wanted subtle result not altering the natural colors and light,' he added.

The London-based photographic authority launched the award to celebrate the breadth and reach of images taken on phones, which can now take incredibly hi-resolution images.

‘Photography now exists in our pockets, and we want to celebrate this,’ it says.

There are more mobile phones on Earth than human beings and the number of devices is growing five times as fast as the population.

Smartphone cameras are increasingly being accepted as legitimate tools with which to take photos and now the WPO has confirmed this by adding an extra category to its 2015 Sony World Photography Awards.

The  photographic authority launched the award to celebrate the breadth and reach of images taken on phones, which can now take incredibly hi-resolution images. This one, called Communications, seems to have been taken in London by a photographer from Ecuador

The new category aims to  allow ' us to look a little closer at those otherwise ordinary moments and to enjoy the creative freedom that mobile phone photography allows. This photo called Catch, demonstrates how an iPhone can capture the movement of birds. It was taken on a trip to Istanbul from a ferry that attracts birds because it goes to Kadıköy,  famous for its fish restaurants and people throw bread

It says that the new category ‘allows us to look a little closer at those otherwise ordinary moments and to enjoy the creative freedom that mobile phone photography allows.’

The WPO says that mobile entries to the awards have ‘increased steadily year on year.

‘It was time for mobile phone photography to have its own dedicated platform, instead of taking the risk of losing some wonderful photos within the hundreds of thousands of entries we receive to the main awards.’

Anyone could submit an image to meet the competition’s brief: ‘You get out of life what you put in. Push past the obvious and see the inspiration all around you.

'Discover the extraordinary by using your mobile phone to view the world through a different lens.’

Photographs had to be shot with a smartphone and be high resolution enough – a minimum of 800KB - to be printed out and shown at an exhibition.

The overall winner will receive a bundle of Sony Mobile products, including an Xperia smartphone and tablet, as well as attending the Sony Photography Awards gala ceremony.

Runners-up will see their entry shown at the exhibition from April 14 to May 10 and will also win a smartphone.
