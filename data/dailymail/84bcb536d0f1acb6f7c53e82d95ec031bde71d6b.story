A Californian billionaire says he feels guilty for getting rich at the ‘expense of labour’ and calls for tax reforms to make the top 1 per cent of earners pay more tax.

Financier William Gross, 69, who owns Pacific Investment Management Company, PIMCO, posted a blog on his website labelling fellow tycoons who complain about taxes as Scrooge McDucks, referring to the Disney character.

Gross, who ranked 641 in the Forbes list of billionaires, according to Sky News, said: ‘Having gotten rich at the expense of labour, the guilt sets in and I begin to feel sorry for the less well-off, writing very public Investment Outlooks that "dis" the success that provided me the soapbox in the first place.’

Billionaire: William Gross, 69, founder of Pacific Investment Management (PIMCO), says the top 1 per cent of earners should pay more tax

'Privileged': The financier's investment company is one of the largest in the world, which oversees billions of dollars. Gross was ranked 641 in the Forbes list of billionaires

He says the Scrooge McDucks of the 
world should think twice about criticising ‘what they consider to be 
counterproductive, even crippling taxation of the wealthy in the midst 
of historically high corporate profits and personal income’.

He suggests rich people think of themselves as ‘privileged’ to have been able to make so much of the national income.

PIMCO is one of the largest active global fixed income investment managers in the world and has $2 trillion in assets under management. It is the world’s largest bond investor.

Gross' 7,100 square-foot home estate in California, which lies by Pebble Beach Golf Course and overlooks Stillwater Bay, cost $20 million.

‘In
 the United States, the share of total pre-tax income accruing to the 
top 1 per cent has more than doubled from 10 per cent in the 1970s to 20
 per cent today.’

Gross
 tells his fellow billionaires to admit that they grew up in a ‘gilded 
age of credit, where those who borrowed money or charged fees on 
expanding financial assets had a much better chance of making it to the 
big tent than those who used their hands for a living’.

‘Congratulations. Smoke that cigar, 
enjoy that Chateau Lafite 1989. But (mostly you guys) acknowledge your 
good fortune at having been born in the '40s, '50s or '60s ... and 
having had the privilege of riding a credit wave and a credit boom for 
the past three decades,’ he writes.

Guilty: The billionaire, who owns PIMCO in California, says having gotten rich at the expense of labour, 'the guilt sets in and I begin to feel sorry for the less well-off'

No Scrooge McDucks: Gross says billionaires, Stanley Druckenmiller, owner of Duquesne Capital Management, left, and Warren Buffet, CEO of Berkshire Hathaway, right, have recently advocated similar proposals to 'end the era of taxing capital at lower rates than labour'

He says he understands how hard many of them worked and says a fair economic system should allow people the chance to succeed.

Gross talks about US billionaires Stanley Druckenmiller and Warren Buffett who have recently mooted similar proposals.

He ends his online speech saying, ‘The era of taxing "capital" at lower rates than "labour" should now end.’
