Burrowed underground, a grubby five-year-old boy peeks expectantly around a makeshift door as a woman prepares his pancakes.

Like the rodent he keeps as a pet, Pavel has grown accustomed to a subterranean existence after nine months living in a basement where he eats, sleeps and plays.

Accompanied by his family and a group of others who have seen their city descend into a war zone, the young boy takes refuge from the ever-present threat of stray bullets and artillery fire.

Waiting for lunch: Pavel Makeev, age 5, peeks his head through a doorway while waiting for his lunch to be cooked in Donetsk, Ukraine

Pavel and his family live in the basement of the cultural centre in Petrovskiy, an area of Donetsk  under pro-Russian rebel control, and the city above him has seen months of heavy and terrifying clashes between Ukrainian troops and rebels.

Since the February 15 ceasefire, fighting may have eased but it has  not stopped altogether. 

The thump of artillery fire and the rattle of automatic guns still echo through a bleak landscape of fallen trees and splintered houses. Going home is still not a safe option.

Life in the basement is simple, but with working electricity, the family have light and are able to use stoves to cook.

A shabby collection of furniture and materials salvaged from buildings above decorates their underground home. Much of the natural light that the few windows allow in is blocked by protective sandbags.

The desperate family are just a few of the thousands of civilians who were forced to flee their homes because of the conflict - which began in April 2014 after Kiev sent its military to the southeastern regions that refused to recognize the new authorities in the capital. 

Nearly a year of fighting has led to at least 5,793 deaths, according to UN estimates. Another 14,595 people have been wounded in the conflict. 

New life: The young boy holds his pet, Masha, who lives with him in his underground home in the Petrovskiy neighborhood of Donetsk

Basic amenities: Pavel and his family were forced to flee their home and move to the squalid basement for their own safety

Underground existence: Beneath the city, Pavel and his sister Raya are safer from the constant threat of stray bullets and artillery fire

Harsh environment: People have been living in this basement since June 2014, two months after the conflict in Ukraine began

Light relief: The basement has working electricity, meaning the children can watch television while they take refuge from the fighting 

Ruined building: An apartment in the neighbourhood is destroyed and abandoned after being hit by artillery rounds in Donetsk, Ukraine

Living area: The haphazard collection of furniture provides the inhabitants of the basement with what little comfort they have

Makeshift bed: Most of the beds consist of pieces of material and furniture salvaged from the war-torn city above

Children's bedroom: Two bunk beds are set up for youngsters in the basement of the Petrovskiy neighborhood cultural centre

Makeshift kitchen: Electric burners are used to cook food for the inhabitants of the basement as they take refuge from fighting in Donetsk 

Making the best of it: Eleonora Tsvetaeva makes a rare trip home since the ceasefire between Ukrainian soldiers and pro-Russian rebels

Household chores: A woman named Lubov empties dirty water into a canister after making a lunch of oat pancakes in the basement home

Hell above ground: A man walks past a building that has been peppered with shrapnel from artillery rounds landing nearby in Donetsk 

Forced to flee homes: A woman leaves her grubby living area by climbing through this opening between makeshift curtains

Extreme measures: Thousands of civilians have been forced to flee their homes since the conflict in Ukraine began in April 2014 

Heavy toll: Nearly a year of fighting has led to at least 5,793 deaths, according to UN estimates. Another 14,595 people have been wounded

Making lunch: Women prepare lunch of oat pancakes in the basement of the cultural centre in Petrovskiy, where there has been heavy fighting

Civil conflict: A tattered Ukrainian flag sits in the clothes drying room. The Petrovskiy neighborhood of Donetsk, which is under pro-Russian rebel control, has seen heavy fighting
