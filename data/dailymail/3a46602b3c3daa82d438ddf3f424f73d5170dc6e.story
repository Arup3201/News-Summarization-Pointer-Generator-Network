A phone call in which Phil Rudd allegedly threatened to kill a man and his daughter is the basis for the AC/DC drummer's court charges.

Rudd, 60, is before the courts on charges of threatening to kill and possession of methamphetamine and cannabis.

The Tauranga-based drummer has denied the charges.

Phil Rudd, seen here outside court on Thursday, allegedly threatened to kill a man and his daughter

In a summary of facts released to media on Friday, the Crown has given a brief outline of what led to the charges.

It says Rudd made a phone call to a man he knew, whose name is suppressed, on September 26, threatening to kill both him and his daughter.

This was consistent with another phone call made by Rudd earlier that morning, the summary of facts said.

It says Rudd denied threatening to kill anybody and denied making any of the phone calls he was alleged to have made when he was interviewed by police.

The drug charges were laid after police executed a search warrant at Rudd's home on November 6. 

Police say Rudd had 0.71g of methamphetamine and 130g of cannabis in his possession.

Rudd was also charged with attempting to procure a murder when he appeared in court in November, but it was dropped by the crown solicitor the following day.

He was filmed being handcuffed by police next to a black sports car by the side of Cameron Road, on the North Island of New Zealand and was then taken to the local station.

However, his lawyer Paul Mabey told Daily Mail Australia that Rudd is now back out on bail.

‘He’s appeared on a breach of bail by speaking to a witness and has been rebailed. He’s been to court and gone home,’ Mr Mabey said. 

He was given an extra bail condition ordering him not to take illicit drugs.

The threatening to kill case is due back in Tauranga District Court on February 10, when a date for a judge-alone trial is likely to be set.
