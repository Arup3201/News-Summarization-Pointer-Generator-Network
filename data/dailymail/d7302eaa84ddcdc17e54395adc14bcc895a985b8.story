Manchester United's horror season has seen the club's value plummet by 11 per cent.

The dethroned Premier League champions, who fell to seventh place under axed boss David Moyes, stay in the top three most valuable clubs in the world despite taking a severe hit thanks to missing out on the Champions League.

Real Madrid top the list, with the Spanish giants being worth £2billion - just ahead of bitter rivals Barcelona - who have added 23 per cent to their value as a club last year.

The top 10 compiled by Forbes sees Premier League champions elect Manchester City as one of the highest gainers - adding 25 per cent to their value, coming in at £508million.

They're behind English rivals Arsenal and Chelsea, who are valued at £767million and £511million respectively.

Liverpool complete the list with a £407million valuation, making half the top 10 German champions Bayern Munich are the year's big winners, having added 41 per cent to their value as a club, which now stands at £1.1billion.

According to this year’s valuations, the top 20 teams are worth an average of £620million, an increase of 8 per cent over last year. The increase is driven by climbing Champions League prize money, television fees and sponsorship revenues. It's the first time since Forbes began tracking team valuations in 2004 that the top two teams are from Spain.
