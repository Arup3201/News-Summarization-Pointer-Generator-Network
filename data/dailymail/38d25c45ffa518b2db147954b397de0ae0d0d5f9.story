A statue of an 'angel of hope' was erected in the Washington cemetery just feet from where Charlie and Braden Powell were buried after their father killed them- and himself- in a house explosion in February.

A crime-fighting group used the donations they collected in the wake of the horrific double murder-suicide of the two young boys paid for the statue to be commissioned.

The Powell family saga, however, drags on with little reason for hope as Charlie and Braden's grandparents still look for any clues relating to the disappearance of the boy's mother Susan.

Reflecting: Chuck Cox, the boy's grandfather, pauses and looks at the statue erected in Charlie and Braden Powell's honor nearly nine months after they were killed by their father

Josh Powell was the main suspect in Susan's 2009 disappearance, since he told police that on that fateful night he decided to take the young boys on an impromptu camping trip in the dead of winter in a Nevada desert.

His siblings have stayed in touch with Susan's parents, Chuck and Judy Cox.

'It is only a 15 minute drive from their home and right up on the hill above Charlie and Braden's plot and the plot where Susan will be buried when we find her,' Kirk Graves, Josh's brother-in-law, told Radar.

The monument at Woodbine Cemetery in Puyallup, Washington near the Cox home was funded by Crime Stoppers and they dedicated it as a place of 'healing' for anyone who has lost a child in their lives.

Common use: The memorial, funded for by donations to Crime Stoppers, was dedicated to all people who have lost children in their lives

Up the hill: The memorial was placed not far from the plot where the two boys are buried, and where Susan Powell will be buried if her body is ever found

As the family begins to go through their first holiday season without the two boys, they are also faced with another absence as the third anniversary of Susan's disappearance is Thursday.

'I have to hope that Josh told somebody something before he killed himself. It is hard to get really hopeful but at the same time there is a possibility that he spoke to his dad,' Graves said.

Josh's dad, Steven, is the one link that remains as Josh lived with Steven for months between the time of Susan's disappearance and the day when Josh hacked his children to death during a court-ordered supervised visit before setting the house on fire with a gas explosion.

Steven is in his own set of legal problems, however, as he has been arrested for two and a half years in jail for two counts of voyeurism.

Happier times: Susan Powell's parents, Chuck and Judy Cox, were living with her sons Charlie (left) and Braden (right) at the time of the horrific incident

Waiting for clues: Steven Powell, Josh's father, may know information about Susan's disappearance, but he refuses to talk and is in jail on different voyeurism charges

During his trial, he revealed that he had a sexual infatuation with Susan and had pictured her secretly at points over the years of his son's marriage.

Even an impending jail sentence didn't sway Steven to reveal details about the whereabouts of her body- if he knows any.

'He won't talk to anyone right now, he won't respond to people who have put in an effort. I have a very low opinion of him and have for 16 years. I feel that if it serves his purpose he will talk but unless he gets something out if it then he has no reason to say anything,' Graves told Radar.
