Brazil face Germany in their World Cup semi-final showdown on Tuesday evening.

And to breed some fighting spirit ahead of their mouth-watering clash against the European giants, the host team, led by David Luiz and Julio Cesar, watched the UFC action from Las Vegas on Saturday night.

The Brazil boys were backing former light heavyweight champion and fellow countryman Lyoto Machida, a winner of four of his last five bouts, who took on the unbeaten American Chris Weidman.

Eyes on the fight: The Brazilian World Cup squad watched Lyoto Machida face off against Chris Weidman

The Brazilians, who overcame Colombia 2-1 in their last-eight tie, paced up and down the room as they watched the middleweight title bout on a giant projection screen. 

At one point during the fight, with Machida having his opponent up against the cage, Cesar, unable to control his emotions, ran up to the screen before throwing air punches in apparent hope of spurring his compatriot on.

Despite a brave resistance however, Machida lost the fight on a unanimous decision and after five gruelling rounds.

Thiago Silva appeared to be filming his team-mates and posted the video to his Instagram account shortly afterwards.

The Brazil captain tagged the video with a message which read: 'Mano you are already champion here, too; family of the Brazilian team'.

The Brazilian squad will train on Monday ahead of Tuesday's tie, and Silva remains some hope of playing in the last-four clash despite being ruled out of the match.

FIFA confirmed that Brazil have lodged an appeal against his yellow card – his second of the tournament – which he picked up in the win over Colombia.

Thiago received the caution after he blocked goalkeeper David Ospina taking a kick.

The Brazilian federation has lodged an appeal and FIFA head of media Delia Fischer said: 'I can confirm we have received an appeal from the CBF and this is being analysed.'

Their chances of success appear limited - appeals against yellow cards are not usually permitted, only red cards.

Real Madrid appealed against Xabi Alonso being suspended for the Champions League final after he picked up a third booking in the semi-final, but UEFA ruled that appeal was inadmissible.

Should FIFA overturn the yellow card it would be hugely controversial and would allow other teams to claim that the governing body is favouring the hosts.
