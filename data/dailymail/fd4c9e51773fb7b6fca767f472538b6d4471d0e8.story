Royal method: Catherine Duchess Of Cambridge is reportedly considering hypnosis as a way of managing the pain of child birth without additional anesthetics

The Duchess of Cambridge is reportedly considering hypnosis to deal with the pain of childbirth.

The ‘hypno-birth’ would mean that her labour pains are lessened without using drugs, according to Grazia magazine.

Advocates of the technique say that it
 helps women use their mind to seize control of the birthing process and
 learn techniques that allow the production of oxytocin, a pain 
relieving hormone which stimulates the uterus.

Women undergoing a hypno-birth may 
still use pain relief - such as an epidural, a pain-killing injection, 
many women find that they don’t need any additional anaesthesia.

Grazia quoted a source who said: ‘Kate
 has researched various birthing methods.

'She wants it to be naturalso 
hypno-birthing is one option that appealed and she ahd been reading up 
on it and listening to CDs to get into the right frame of mind. 

'Some of 
her friends have used this method and swear by it. kate wants to do it 
her way and be relaxed.’

A royal spokeswoman said she was aware of the report, but declined to confirm or deny it.

‘We appreciate it’s a happy occasion...but there are some matters which should remain private to the duchess.’

If the story is true, Kate’s tendency to set trends could lead many other women to follow her example.

It is understood that the Duchess is 
due to give birth in the private Lindo wing at St Mary’s Hospital in 
Paddington, where Prince William was born.

The Duchess is believed to be taking 
prenatal yoga classes which focus on strengthening and increasing the 
flexibility of the muscles used during childbirth.

She is also said to be keeping her fitness up with regular swimming sessions at Buckingham Palace.

The Blissful Birth website which deal 
with hypno-birthing  said in a blog that a number of hypno-birthing 
practitioners had ‘spun’ the news ‘into a suggestion that the Duchess is
 considering their particular approach.’

But it added: ‘Regardless of the 
ultimate decision on natural birth techniques, I am grateful to the 
Duchess for her willingness to explore options for a natural birth – 
especially as it was Queen Victoria who led the way for women to use 
drugs in labour.

Hypno-birthing encourages the father 
to become directly involved in the birth, something which is not 
exactly  a traditional role for a royal father.

The Hypnobirth Association says that the father acts as an ‘anchor’ throughout the birth.

Speaking on the website, Katherine Graves, a specialist, says the word ‘hypno’ actually does the technique a disservice.

She adds: ‘Hypnobirthing helps you 
release the fears and gives you the tool so that your body can give 
birth efficiently and comfortably in the way it is designed to do.’

‘To have serious consideration from a 
well-educated, intelligent and progressive couple like William and Kat 
shows how far towards mainstream our profession has come over the last 
decade.’
