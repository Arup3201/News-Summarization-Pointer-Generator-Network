A 22-year-old man wanted in connection with the suspected murder of a teenage girl has handed himself in to police and was arrested this morning.

Jack Wall, of Stevenage, Hertfordshire, was arrested by officers investigating the disappearance of Amelia Arnold, 19, who was last seen on Wednesday and is feared to have been murdered.

Police are focusing inquiries on her home in Hadrian's Walk, Stevenage, and had released an image of Wall, who is understood to be blind in one eye and was described as having a distinctive squint.

Miss Arnold, 19, a hairdresser 
originally from Horam, East Sussex, moved to Hertfordshire at some point
between 2008 and 2010, and attended the Sir Frederic Osborn School in 
Welwyn Garden City.

She is believed to have been working 
as a hair stylist at The Works salon in Stevenage. Police have sealed 
off a mid-terraced house in Hadrian's Walk, as forensic experts comb the
building for clues.

Hadrian's Walk residents said the first they knew of anything untoward was on Saturday.

One local man said: 'I noticed there was an unmarked car with three plain clothes policemen sitting in it, from about 10am.

‘Then from about 3pm or 3.30pm 
forensic science people turned up and then they left. Then there was a 
hell of a lot of people coming and going.'

Disappearance: The missing girl, from Stevenage, Hertfordshire, has not been seen since Wednesday

DCI Redfearn had earlier appealed 
directly to Wall to present himself to police, saying: 'If you are 
reading this, please go to Stevenage or your nearest police station to 
speak with officers.'

Witnesses who may have seen suspicious
activity at the address between Wednesday and Friday are also being 
asked to come forward.

Mr Redfearn said: 'We’ve been speaking
with residents in Hadrian’s Walk but I would like to hear from anyone 
who has been in the area between these times and believes they may have 
seen or heard any suspicious activity to make contact with police.

'We would also like to appeal to 
anyone who may have witnessed anyone acting suspiciously in a white 
Citroen Berlingo, registration R389 VDP, in the Stevenage area since 
Wednesday.’

Meanwhile, a 41-year-old man from the 
local area has been arrested in connection with the investigation and is
in police custody.
