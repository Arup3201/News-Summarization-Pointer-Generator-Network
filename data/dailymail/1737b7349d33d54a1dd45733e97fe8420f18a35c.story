If heights aren’t your thing, you might want to steer clear of a new skyscraper in China.

Hitachi have announced they are to build the world’s fastest ultra-high-speed elevator in the Guangzhou CTF Finance Centre in Guangzhou, China.

The building will be completed in 2016, and inside will be the rapid lifts that can climb 95 floors in just 43 seconds.

The Guangzhou CTF Finance Centre is an upscale mixed-use skyscraper that will provide office, hotel and residential space.

In total the giant structure will have 111 above-ground floors and five below-ground floors.

It is being built in the city’s Tianhe District, with the goal of fully opening the building in 2016.

While it is not the tallest skyscraper in the world, its elevators will certainly be something to behold.

In total the structure will have 95 elevators but only two will hold the accolade of being the world’s fastest.

*If travelling at full velocity

The elevators are powered by a magnet synchronous motor, which allows for the high output needed to attain the high speeds.

At maximum velocity the elevators will ascend at nearly 4,000 ft (1,200 metres) per minute.

This is equivalent to 44mph (70kph).

When descending the elevators are slightly slower at 2,000ft (600 m) per minute, or 22.4mph (36 kph).

The elevators will climb from the ground floor to the 95th, and they will be able to make the journey in 43 seconds.

Hitachi say the elevator will have technologies that support safe and comfortable elevator operation, so passengers will have a comfortable ride even at these high speeds.

The company has a history of making speedy climbers – back in 1968 it designed Japan’s fastest elevator at the time in the Kasumigaseki Building, which travelled at a rather more sedate 980 feet (300 metres) per minute.

There will be a variety of safety measures in their latest elevator.

These include braking systems and emergency stop devices that can detect excessive speeds.

The brakes have outstanding heat resistance too -  even in the unlikely event of a malfunction, they can stop the elevator during high-speed operation.

To retain a level of comfort, guide rollers in four corners of the elevator car can also detect sideways vibrations due to wind pressure.

And to prevent a person's ears popping, Hitachi will change the air pressure in the car as it ascends and descends.

Construction on the CTF Guangzhou building, previously the Chow Tai Fook Centre, began in 2010 (picture taken on 23 December 2012) and is due for completion in 2016

Inside it will have two of the rapid elevators along with 93 'slower' ones

@highlight

The two will be capable of travelling 3,940ft (1,200m) a minute at top speed

This makes them the fastest elevators in the world, travelling at 44mph (70km), beating the previous record-holder by about 8mph
