Alex Neil has warned Norwich he will demand full managerial control before committing his future to the Carrow Road club.

Hamilton agreed compensation with the Canaries on Thursday to take their manager to the Championship.

Neil, who caught the eye of the Norfolk club by leading Accies to promotion then to third in the Scottish Premiership, has already held preliminary discussions with the City board and will resume them on Friday.

But although it’s widely anticipated that his move is a formality, the 33-year-old insists no club in the land could tempt him if he isn’t afforded full scope to do his job.

‘What has to happen is, when we discuss things, I’ve got to be happy with what the job description will be and what my role will be, in terms of how much power I’ll have,’ Neil said.

‘Because here at Hamilton the bottom line is I’ve got the decisions to make, I’m the decision maker and whatever comes or goes is through me.’

Asked about the increasing number of head-coach positions south of the border where player recruitment is done by someone else, Neil stated: ‘That won’t be the case. The bottom line is, if I’m a manager I’ll manage. I’m not going to be going for someone to tell me what to do — there’s no point in me going if that’ s the case.

Neil Adams resigned on Monday after less than nine months in charge of the Championship club

‘My description of a manager — and this is nothing to do with Norwich, just my description — is he is the guy that manages the team and any players that come or go. He’s the guy that makes the decision whether they come or go.’

Pressed if there was any suggestion that Norwich weren’t looking for a traditional manager, Neil retorted: ‘Not so far, whether that’s the case tomorrow (Friday), that’s how it might not happen.

‘Really tomorrow (Friday) will determine what will happen one way or the other.

‘It’s the full thing, the package has got to be right. I’m not going to uproot my family and move down there for an extra 20 quid.

‘And I’m not going to go down there to be dictated by someone else who will tell me what to do.’

Barring a remarkable turn of events, however, confirmation of Neil replacing Neil Adams at Carrow Road will come later today.

Accies vice-chairman Ronnie MacDonald believes Neil’s move to a side sitting just out-with the Championship play-offs positions further enhances his club’s reputation as a developer of people.

‘An amicable arrangement has been agreed and Alex can now go and discuss terms with them,’ he said.

‘We are delighted for Alex. He has been fantastic for us and is yet another Hamilton success story, whereby we have produced players, sports scientists, managers and coaches.

‘Alex is the latest one. We were lucky enough to have Billy Reid, who became manager of the year, and had the chance to go to Swansea.

Neil is set to leave his role as player manager at Hamilton, the club where he has been for nearly 10 years

‘We also had Graeme Jones here, who is now assistant to Roberto Martinez at Everton, and now Alex is the latest one. We wish him all the best.’

With Frankie McAvoy, who doubles as Accies’ academy director and Neil’s No 2, also expected to head south, MacDonald needs to find a temporary manager before the visit of Dundee United on Monday.

Captain Martin Canning has been tipped to fill that post but MacDonald refused to speculate on a full-time successor.

‘It’s much too early to be thinking about a replacement,’ he added. ‘Les Gray, the chairman, is on holiday and when he gets back and it settles down there are a few things we want to tweak within the set-up.’
