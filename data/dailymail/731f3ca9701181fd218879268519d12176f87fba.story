Two men who ran a 'sophisticated' forgery factory which produced passports, cash, bank cards and an array of official documents have been jailed.

Belkacem Lakehal, 41, and Mohand Said Mouchache, 45, who have dual British and Algerian nationality, previously pleaded guilty to various offences following an investigation by detectives from the Metropolitan Police.

Sentencing the pair at London’s Snaresbrook Crown Court, Judge Joanna Korner said: 'This was a well planned and well executed operation that is shown clearly by the type of equipment and the number of documents and also by the orders that were being placed for these documents.

'Such documents, even if the passports or ID documents could not be used to facilitate entry or exit into the country, they could clearly be used for fraud or for money laundering and as a consequence the gaining of employment to which the person in possession of these forged documents was not entitled.

'As far as the income which was generated, it is hard to say, but clearly it was a profitable enterprise.'

The pair were arrested on April 17 following a four-month operation that led officers to their hub in Tavistock Road, South Woodford, east London.

Police entered the address to find Mouchache in the process of making forged UK residence permits on a desktop computer.

Further searches there found commercial standard paper and card printers, precision cutting laminating equipment and all the raw materials with which to make false identity documents.

More than 130 partially complete forged passports for a number of EU countries, forged driving licences for various EU countries and numerous National Insurance number cards were uncovered.

Also in the room was a 'kit' to manufacture counterfeit £1 coins including lead ingots, casting moulds and an electro-plating tank, as well as a total of 1,896 cast lead counterfeit £1 coins.

The computer that was being used by Mouchache was found to contain more than 6,500 images and programmes relating to the manufacture of false identity documents.

More than £20,000 in cash was also seized from the searched premises.

Each had been charged with the other offence their co-defendant pleaded guilty to, but the counts were ordered to lie on file

Both defendants pleaded guilty to conspiring with each other and others unknown to make false passports for use in fraud and to a charge of conspiring with each other and others unknown to make false National Insurance cards and other identity documents for use in fraud.

Lakehal also admitted conspiring to make counterfeit £1 coins, while Mouchache pleaded guilty to conspiring to make false bank cards for use in fraud.

Each had been charged with the other offence their co-defendant pleaded guilty to, but the counts were ordered to lie on file.

Lakehal, of South Woodford, was jailed for five years for each count, to run concurrently, while Mouchache, of Southwark, was jailed for four years for each concurrently, which the judge said took his earlier guilty plea into account.

Both defendants were described as 'family men' of previous good character with no criminal convictions.

Detective Inspector Sarah Davies said: 'This was a sophisticated network, supplying a vast number of forged documents to organised criminals, enabling them to commit crime and operate with the appearance of legitimacy.

'Thousands of documents and computer files were examined and catalogued and such was the quality of the evidence presented, Mouchache and Lakehal had little option but to plead guilty.

'Hopefully this conviction will send a strong message to others engaged in this type of criminality that the Metropolitan Police Service is determined to stamp out forgery and identity crime to keep our communities safer.'
