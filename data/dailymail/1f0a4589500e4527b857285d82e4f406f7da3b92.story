The love of her life died fighting in the trenches of the First World War and she had lived through the horrors of the London Blitz.

But nothing prepared Britain’s oldest woman for the terror of being targeted in her own home by a violent career criminal.

Grace Jones had just celebrated her 
112th birthday when Jesse Coker burst into her flat. He kicked her door 
down and shoved her against a wall as he rifled her handbag, snatching 
£100 in cash.

Jesse Coker (right) pretended to be a delivery man to gain access to her
 home, where he pinched her purse.

Yesterday, after he was jailed for 
four and a half years, it emerged that Coker was on licence at the time 
for a series of burglaries in which he preyed on the elderly.

The 46-year-old has 16 convictions for
 48 burglaries dating back to the age of ten. Yet he was let out in May 
2009 after serving half of a seven-year sentence despite the risk of him
 reoffending.

Miss Jones, who was born on December 7, 1899, became the oldest living person in Britain in February this year.

Jesse Coker, 46, tricked his way into the home of Grace Jones (right) in south London a month after her 112th birthday.

The spinster had only celebrated her 112th birthday a month before she was attacked in her home in Rotherhithe, south London.

The former seamstress, who lost her 
19-year-old fiancé Albert Rees during the First World War, now lives 
alone in the area which has become a magnet for crime. Woolwich Crown 
Court heard that five days before her birthday, an unidentified thief 
entered her home and stole her £300 pension.

The next day Coker attempted to 
break-in by posing as a parcel delivery man but her neighbour Matthew 
Maddigan, 31, chased him off after the brave pensioner told Coker to 
‘hop it’.

Then on January 24, Miss Jones answered a knock at the door to find Coker posing as a policeman.

Vivian Walters, prosecuting, said: 
‘Miss Jones went to the door and called out “Who’s there?” ‘She was 
expecting the district nurse to visit her that day in order to change a 
dressing on her leg.

‘She heard no reply so she opened the 
door a crack. He pushed the door open, barged past Mrs Jones and made 
his way into the flat.’

When the trembling victim followed him into the living room, Coker pushed her against the wall.

He grabbed her purse, which contained 
£100 as well as other treasured items including a four leaf clover she 
kept for luck, before leaving her crumpled on the floor.

Mr Maddigan confronted Coker outside 
having recognised him, but the thug threatened to stab them, snarling: 
‘I’ve got a tool and I will hurt you.’

The neighbour said: ‘I was just so 
shocked to see the same guy back again. I heard someone ring Grace’s 
doorbell and opened the door to make sure everything was alright.

‘I heard Grace say “What are you doing” and “Get off me” so I rushed downstairs.

‘I confronted him. I just wanted him 
to stop and tried to get in his way. He said he had a knife and was 
going to stab me. He kept saying he was going to kill me.’

Coker was only caught when he was spotted by chance by Mr Maddigan the next day a mile away.

He flagged down a police car and the thief was arrested on the spot.

But the criminal continued to deny responsibility until he suddenly changed his plea on the first day of his trial on Tuesday.

Yesterday Miss Jones said she has been ‘frightened ever since’ and now refused to leave her home.

She said: ‘I told him to hop it. Then some days later, he came back and said he was from the police.

‘After I opened the door, he pushed me and got my bag. I have been frightened ever since.’

The spinster, who has outlived her 
seven siblings, added: ‘I am so old that all my friends and family are 
now dead. I think I’m very lucky to have such good neighbours.

‘They are my family now, and they know it. They are very good to me.’

Detective Constable Mark Powell, from 
Southwark’s Priority Crime Unit, said: ‘Coker picked on a vulnerable 
victim who he believed to be an easy target, he didn’t consider the 
bravery of the victim or the tenacity of her neighbours who were 
commended by the judge at today’s sentencing.

‘It is thanks to them Coker was 
apprehended so quickly and allowed police to conduct a thorough 
investigation, giving him no choice but plead guilty.’
