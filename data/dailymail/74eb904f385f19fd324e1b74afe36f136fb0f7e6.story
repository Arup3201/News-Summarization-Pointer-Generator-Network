Ayoze Perez was Newcastle’s match-winner with his first goal for the club on what was his full Premier League debut.

But who is rookie Spaniard? Sportsmail brings you more…

Where did he come from?

Ayoze Perez celebrates scoring the winner for Newcastle against Tottenham on his first start for the club

 Newcastle moved quickly to beat off interest from a host of Spanish clubs and signed the 21-year-old from Tenerife for £1.5m in June.

Why was there so much interest?

Well, 16 goals in Spain’s second tier alerted the Magpies and many others but the player preferred to test himself in the Premier League. He left White Hart Lane and headed straight back to his homeland for an awards ceremony, where he is up for the best breakthrough player prize for last season. He has also now broken into Spain’s Under-21 side.

How has he done at Newcastle?

After seven substitute appearances he had yet to break his duck before his headed winner at Spurs. He did, however, score a sublime solo effort for the Under-21s, weaving his way between four defenders before slotting home.

And that won him a start?

Not really, although it did put him to the front of the queue should Papiss Cisse have got injured. And that is exactly what happened, the Senegal striker failing a fitness test just two hours before the game.

Alan Pardew must have been delighted with him?

He was, and here’s what he said: ‘He’s a really great individual talent. He hasn’t quite got the strength and power that you associate with the Premier League but that will come to him. He has worked really, really hard. The players love him so they were really made up that he scored the winner.’

Does he speak any English then?

Sportsmail tried to grab a few words with him outside of the ground, and this is what we got. ‘I am very happy. I hope I can play good for Newcastle and score many goals.’ The Toon Army will certainly be hoping he is good to his word.
