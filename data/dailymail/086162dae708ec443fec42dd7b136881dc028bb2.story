Gary Cahill insists Harry Kane is ready to start for England against Lithuania in their Euro 2016 qualifier on Friday.

The absence of Daniel Sturridge, withdrawn from the squad with a hip injury, has boosted the Tottenham striker’s chances of being included in the first eleven.

Cahill has faced Kane three times playing for Chelsea this season and was given a torrid time by the forward when he scored twice in Spurs’ 5-3 win on New Years' Day.

Asked how Kane was fitting into training after getting his first call-up to the national squad, Cahill replied: ‘Really good. He’s been a real handful every time I’ve played against him. He’s a fantastic talent, not just holding the ball up but running in behind defenders. For me he’s got all the attributes a striker needs.

‘He scored a hat-trick just before his first meet-up with the England team is ideal so his confidence will be sky high. He’s still a young boy and it’s his first time in the squad. It’s always a bit daunting.’ Kane, still only 21, scored a treble against Leicester at the weekend to take his tally to 29 in all competitions, joint-top Premier League scorer with Diego Costa on 19 goals.

Wayne Rooney and Danny Welbeck are both available, but Cahill is confident Kane will be ready if England manager Roy Hodgson decides to throw him in.

‘That’s down to the manager,’ he added. ‘We’ve got top strikers here. They’re all chomping at the bit to play, all good enough to play from the start, and Harry’s in that bracket. ‘He’s in top form in the league. To score a hat-trick leading up to your first senior call up is fantastic. I’m sure he feels he’s ready to play. It’s down to the manager, whatever he decides.’

Manchester United midfielder Michael Carrick echoed Cahill’s sentiment and has also backed Kane to have a bright future in the England senior team.

He said: 'I think the progress he has made has been sensational from the start of the season to the level that he is at now. He has gone up two or three levels and the thing that has impressed me most about him is that as the spotlight has grown and expectations have grown he has grown and his performances have improved and improved and that is a really good sign. It by no means looks like this is a one off season. He looks like the real deal. I am sure he has a big big future ahead of him.

’The options are frightening, whoever plays whether it’s Sturridge, Welbeck, Wayne, Raheem Sterling, it's great to have those in the squad. We have an abundance of talent going forward. When you are at that level like the boys are they can play with each other no problem.’
