A 63-year-old woman has been left brain damaged after undergoing routine surgery to remove a small tumour on her adrenal glands

A 63-year-old woman has been left brain damaged after undergoing routine surgery to remove a small tumour.

Michelle Peters from the Northern Territory went in for an operation last month to remove a tumour on her adrenal gland when a surgical mishap saw carbon dioxide being pumped through the her liver and into her bloodstream.

The incident forced doctors to place Mrs Peters in an induced coma for two days, spending the next five days in intensive care at the Royal Darwin Hospital. 

'You put a lot of trust in them and you think they’re going to do the right thing and when they don’t you do feel betrayed,' Mrs Peters told the NT News.

Mrs Peters has been left with memory loss and hindered motor skills. 

'It's about the worst thing that could happen to you at this stage in life,' she said. 

'They're going to take my licence away from me and I won't be able to go back to work because I'm a chef,' she said. 'I want to go back to work ... I loved my job.'

Mrs Peters also fears how she will get by in life without 'any income coming in'. 

Four-years ago the 63-year-old widow was given a  chance at new life,  marrying subcontractor Garry Peters. 

Mr Peters has been left devastated and uncertain with what the future holds. 

'She’s just not same... They can’t tell us how long it’s going to take to get better or if it is going to get better,' he said.

Now a full-time carer to his wife, Mr Peters has had to turn down jobs to look after his brain damaged wife.

'I had to turn down a really good opportunity ... it would have been a big break for us, I’ve lost a lot of money.'

The incident has forced the couple to have to rely on Centrelink.

'I’ve had to apply for a disability pension for Michelle and a carer’s pension for me,' Mr Peters said.

Sharon Sykes, the acting chief operating officer of Top End Health Service, said senior management at the hospital were 'aware of this case'. 

'The Division of Surgery has been in discussion with the family and is sensitive to the distress they are experiencing,' Ms Sykes said.

'Royal Darwin Hospital is a fully accredited facility that practices under the national standards. Should an adverse event occur within any of our hospitals we observe national incident management processes which include undertaking a full investigation; observing National Open Disclosure processes by discussing the event openly with patients, families and carers; and ensuring any remedial systems improvements and leanings are implemented as part of our safety and quality focus.'

Despite everything, Mrs Peters still  has the small tumour on her adrenal gland. 

The hospital has offered to fly her to any hospital in Australia to have the operation.

'I won’t have the operation here after everything, would you?'

Sharon Sykes, the acting chief operating officer of Top End Health Service, said senior management at the hospital were 'aware of this case'
