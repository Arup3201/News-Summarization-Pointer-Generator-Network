New Tottenham boss Mauricio Pochettino has identified the capture of a new left-back as a summer priority, with Swansea’s Ben Davies the shock name on his hit list.

Spurs watched the 21-year-old extensively last season and his name will be recommended to Pochettino.

Davies was excellent for Swansea last season and attracted interest from Atletico Madrid.
