There's nothing quite like a cuddly sleeping wombat picture to set the internet on fire and Kenny the orphaned baby-wombat has certainly proved that in this precious laid-back snap.

Kenny appears to have fallen asleep with his head  in his chest and his legs in the air, while sitting propped up on a chair in the cute picture.

The photo has garnered over 72,000 likes in the last 24 hours on the Australia.com Facebook page.

Some confused Facebook users questioned Kenny's anatomy in the picture, mistaking his tail for his genitals. The hilarious online debate prompted Australia.com to post an update on Facebook, verifying that it is in fact his tail showing in the photo.

This picture of Kenny the wombat has sent the internet wild, accumulating over 70,000 likes in 23 hours. There was some confusion over his anatomy

'Um, for those that asked, Kenny is showing his tail, not his peenee,' they said.  

The furry wombat became an orphan last month when his mother was hit by a car and died. 

When the wombat arrived at the park, his nose was red and his had minor abrasions to his paws. 

'His feet and nose are red because he’s been out of his mum’s pouch for way too long, but we’re hoping he’ll pull through.' Mr Faulkner said on Facebook. 

Kenny got his name after he was found by a man called Ken in the Hunter Valley near Scone in NSW. Ken drove the animal all the way to the Australian Reptile Park in Somersby, where he knew he would be cared for.

Lucky for Kenny, wildlife personality and TV star Tim Faulkner has taken full responsibility for the little fur-ball

Lucky for Kenny, wildlife personality and TV star Tim Faulkner has taken full responsibility for the little fur-ball. 

Mr Faulkner has gone a step further to rehabilitate this baby wombat, by bringing Kenny home to live with him and his family. 

'It’s great! He runs around with my two young sons. They love it,' Mr Faulkner told Daily Mail Australia. 

Mr Faulkner believes there is something special about his furry friend. 

'All wombats are cute, but there’s just something about Kenny,' he said, 

Wombats are native only to Australia

Wombats are mammals 

Their closest relative is the koala

Wombats feed on grass and roots 

Wombats are rarely seen during the day as they are nocturnal

Wombats have very short muscular legs

'Kenny follows me everywhere I go, just like he'd do with his mum. It's very cute,' Mr Faulkner said on Facebook.  

'A reminder to all, please stop and check the pouches of injured wildlife. Kenny will be a great little ambassador for his marsupial mates!' he said. 

Faulkner kicked off his career at Featherdale Wildlife Park in Sydney when he was 14-years -old, taking part in a work experience course at the park.

He was a regular on popular show Bondi Vet before his infectious enthusiasm for wildlife landed him his own television show called The Wild Life of Tim Faulkner, which is currently in its second series.

'Series two is airing on Saturday afternoons and gong really well. I’m off to Broome tomorrow to film stories for Series three,' Mr Faulkner said.

Tim and Kenny have become firm friends. Tim is nursing Kenny back to health after his mother was hit by a car and killed

 While Kenny is not yet fully rehabilitated, he is in good hands. 

'Kenny the orphaned wombat is doing really well. He's not quite out of the clear yet, but it's looking good. As you can see, he's feeding well' Mr Faulkner said. 

'We’re hoping that he’ll continue gaining weight and growing. He may be suitable for release down the track, but if not, he’ll live at the Reptile Park and become an ambassador for his species,' he said.

This sleeping picture of Kenny drinking out of a bottle has been a hit on social media.
