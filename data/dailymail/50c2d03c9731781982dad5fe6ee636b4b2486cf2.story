Tragic: Gloria Knowles, who was savaged to death by her daughter's dogs, pictured at Harrington's pie and mash shop, Tooting, where she worked

A pack of four family dogs which mauled a pensioner to death had savaged her grandchildren and attacked other animals before the fatal attack, an inquest heard today.

Gloria Knowles, 71, was set upon by two ‘giant’ Bordeaux French mastiffs, which weighed between seven and nine-and-a-half stones (40-60 kilograms), and two American bulldog-type dogs as she went to feed them in her daughter’s garden on October 30 last year.

She was so badly injured one of her arms was almost severed in the attack.

A fifth dog, who the family were looking after for a friend, may also have been involved in the attack.

Mrs Knowles’ daughter Beverley said one of the bulldogs, a male Alapaha blue blood, had attacked two other dogs in the months before her mum was savaged and she had wanted it put down.

She said: 'He had a fight with one of my friend’s dogs in the park and then he attacked our female bulldog as well.

'I didn’t trust him very much if I’m honest. After he attacked the other two dogs it really scared me and I wanted him put down.'

The mother-of-three, of Morden, Surrey, added: 'There was another incident in about May last year where the same dog killed our family cat.'

Beverley’s ex Dylan Mason said there were also two incidents involving the former couple’s sons last summer.

He
said: 'My older son, who was 16 at the time, was chased by the four 
dogs in the park. They just kept jumping up at him and trying to grab 
him.

Brutal: The court heard how all of the dogs, including two French Mastiffs, two American bulldogs and a small mongrel (all pictured), have been put down after all their bite marks were found on Mrs Knowles' body

'And a couple of months later they attacked my 10-year-old son and he had quite severe bite marks on his arm.'

It also emerged the dogs had also savaged Mrs Knowles the previous summer.

But instead of putting it down the 
family, who had six dogs at that time, got rid of two other dogs, 
leaving them with four in their home in Morden, Surrey.

Recording a narrative verdict, 
Westminster Coroner Fiona Wilcox, said: 'It would appear that all four 
dogs had a history of behaving in ways that were inappropriate.

'In
the summer before this incident both of the French Mastiffs were 
involved in chasing and running down Beverley’s eldest son and her 
youngest, who was 10 at the time, received severe bites to his arm.

'The Alapaha bulldog had also attacked another dog in the park and then attacked one of her other dogs within two weeks.

Daughter Beverley Knowles, left, said she was scared of one of her dogs after it attacked another in a park. The inquest heard how Gloria Knowles, right, was apparently afraid of the dogs she was going to feed

'This disturbed her to the point she wanted the dog put down.'

Ms Wilcox said Mrs Knowles apparently didn't trust the Alapaha as it had previously jumped up and bit her hand.

She
said the series of attacks suggested that all the dogs were 'out of 
control' having all shown evidence of 'behaving aggressively before this
incident'.

'I think it is 
very, very sad the dogs that chased Beverley’s son and had bitten Mrs 
Knowles before unfortunately acted in the way that they did the day of 
the attack and took Mrs Knowles' life.'

Beverley’s
ex-husband Dylan Mason told the coroner he didn’t have the dogs put 
down because he 'believed they needed some more time spent on training 
them'.

On
the day of the attack widow Mrs Knowles, who had lived next door to her
daughter since her husband Victor died of cancer in 2007, was looking 
after her grandchildren.

At around 5pm she went next door to feed her daughter’s dogs.

Neighbours reported hearing shrieks but thought it was the kids playing.

Mr Mason returned from work to his home in Rutland Drive an hour later and discovered the body. He said: 'The mongrel was really excited to see me when I came in. The other four dogs were behind the stair gate in the conservatory.

'I noticed a pile of clothes in the garden. I thought the dogs had pulled the washing off the line then I saw it was Mrs Knowles. It was only then I saw blood around the dogs mouths and two of the dogs were covered in blood.'

Mrs Knowles was pronounced dead at 6.24pm. A post mortem found she died of shock and blood loss.

Pathologist Dr Ashley Fegan-Earl said she received multiple bite wounds, most of them to her arms, head and neck.

Detective Sergeant Danny Taylor said he believed all of the dogs were involved in the attack.

He
said: 'There is evidence from a surgeon who examined Mrs Knowles body 
that given the measurements of the dental casts taken from the dogs that
all the dogs had at some stage bitten her.'

Animals removed: Police have seized the two French Mastiffs, the American bulldogs and the mongrel and are in police-approved kennels pending the post-mortem

Tragedy: Dog baskets and food bowls can be seen in the garden at the scene where Gloria Knowles may have been mauled to death by the animals

The dogs have since been destroyed after police ruled they were a danger to the public.

Mrs Knowles, who was described as a ‘very placid person who was always on the go doing housework or gardening’ had helped run a family pie shop in Tooting, south London, for several generations.

Beverley wiped away a tear as the coroner spoke of her mother as a ‘popular and well known figure in the area where she lived and worked for many years.’

Two years ago Barbara Williams, 52, was mauled to death by an eight stone Neapolitan mastiff in Wallington, south London.

The dog had been kept in a cage seven inches shorter than its body. Earlier this year its owner Alex Blackburn-Smith, 35, admitted failing to ensure the dog's welfare and was ordered to do 150 hours' unpaid work and pay costs of £3,300 at Croydon Magistrates' Court. 

In January Leslie Trotman, 83, died after he was mauled by a 'pitbull-type' dog that had broken out of his neighbour's garden in Brentford, West London.
