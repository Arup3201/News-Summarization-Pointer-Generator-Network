An HIV scare involving a porn movie actor has spurred another call to halt production in California's adult film industry.

The Free Speech Coalition, a California-based trade group representing the industry is calling for a three-day production moratorium following a possible HIV exposure on an out-of-state film set.

The Los Angeles Times reports the group called for the halt on Wednesday but didn't name the state where the film set was located.

The coalition last called for an industry moratorium in August after a report that a performer tested positive for HIV. However, it lifted the two-day ban after determining the test result was a false positive.

The group's CEO, Diane Duke, says she's working with public health officials, the production company and the performer to investigate the incident.

She said: 'As with past production holds, we ask that people refrain from speculation until more news is forthcoming, and respect performer privacy'.

Production of porn movies has shifted away from California since a law requiring actors to wear condoms was passed

An announcement is expected Friday on whether production can resume and whether performers should have additional HIV testing.

Production of porn movies has shifted away from California since a law requiring actors to wear condoms was passed.

Last year only 40 permits for adult productions were issued across the city and county - a 90 per cent drop from 2012 when the measure was passed.

Porn production crews are now said to be mostly traveling to Nevada, Southern California, Florida, and Eastern Europe to film.

An earlier moratorium ended last September, at which point performers became required to test for HIV and other STIs every 14 days instead of every 28.

Prior to that, a performer who goes by the name Cameron Bay made national headlines when she tested positive for HIV followed by her adult film actor boyfriend.

The AIDS Healthcare Foundation, which successfully fought to require condoms for porn actors in Los Angeles city and county,  said it underscored the need for statewide action.
