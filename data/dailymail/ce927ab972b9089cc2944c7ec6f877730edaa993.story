Northern England has woken to a light blanket of snow this morning, ahead of the Met Office issuing a nationwide cold weather alert for next week.

Those who thought that February would bring milder weather and the promise of spring are set to be sorely disappointed - as bitter winds with ice and snow will sweep over the country by the middle of the week.

The Met Office issued the warning saying: 'There is a 70 per cent probability of icy conditions and snow between Tuesday morning and 8am on Wednesday in parts of England.

'However, the primary concern at first 
is for temperatures and a significant wind chill, and there is now an 
increased probability of mean temperatures of 2 C or less occurring in 
many areas of England from Tuesday onwards.'

Met Office weather forecaster Andy Bodenham said: 'We're looking at quite a cold week. There's going to be the possibility of wintry weather, a mix of rain, sleet and snow.

'The warning stretches across England, apart from the south west of England and London area, which won't be affected as much.

'As well as the cold temperatures, we're concerned about the strength of the wind.
