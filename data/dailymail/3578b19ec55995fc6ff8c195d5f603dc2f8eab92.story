Footage has emerged of Darren Wilson - the police officer who killed Michael Brown - threatening to arrest a man for filming him.

The video shows Wilson approaching a resident in Ferguson, Missouri, and demanding that he put away his camera.

It comes as a grand jury deliberates whether or not to indict Wilson for killing Brown in August, which sparked months of protest and accusations of racism.

'Lock your ass up': Darren Wilson was filmed last year threatening to arrest a man for filming him

The arrest was filmed in 2013, but was only posted online this week. It shows Wilson telling Mike Arman, a 30-year-old Ferguson resident, to put away his phone or be arrested.

Wilson, thinking he is being photographed rather than filmed, said: 'If you wanna take a picture of me one more time, I’m gonna lock your ass up.'

In response, Arman, identified by the Guardian, said: 'Sir, I’m not taking a picture, I’m recording this incident, sir.'

The clip cuts out after Wilson approaches, but an incident report which Wilson filled out after the event revealed that Arman was cuffed and taken to Ferguson police station.

There he was charged with failure to comply with Wilson, and also for breaching regulations on pit bull dogs. The charges were later dropped, Arman claims, when he showed police the video footage and proved his pet was not a pit bull.

The incident offers another insight into Wilson, whose behavior during the fatal confrontation with Brown is under intense scrutiny.

Wilson was investigating a theft when he came across Brown and a friend, whom he first told off for jaywalking.

He then confronted them over the robbery, leading to the fatal shooting of Brown.

Recordings released yesterday from the event suggests the entire incident took less than 90 seconds.

Accounts of the shooting vary wildly. Leaked details of Wilson's account tell how an aggressive Brown tried to wrestle him inside his SUV, and only let go after being shot.

The account then purportedly says Brown ran away, only to 'charge' at Wilson, leading him to fire several more shots, which killed the 18-year-old.

Others say Brown was in fact shot in the back while fleeing. Some have said he was raising his hands in submission when the fatal shots came.

A grand jury is currently deliberating on whether to indict him over the shooting, and is expected to make its decision this month.

A Ferguson police spokesman suggested to the Guardian that the filmed officer might not be Wilson - even though he wrote the incident report after arresting Arman.
