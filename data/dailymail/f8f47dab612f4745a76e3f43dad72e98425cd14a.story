Police today have today released CCTV footage that allegedly shows the brother of former EastEnders actress Gemma McCluskie disposing of her body.

The Old Bailey agreed to release the footage which allegedly shows Tony McCluskie taking her body in a suitcase and dumping it in a canal, is tried for murdering his sister.

He told the court he had no recollection of killing her or dismembering her and disposing of her corpse.

The 35-year-old said the last thing he remembered was grabbing his sister’s wrists as she wielded a knife at him and threatened to stab him on March 1 last year.

He admits killing Miss McCluskie but denies murder, saying he has no recollection of what happened after he grabbed her.

This CCTV footage, shown in court today, allegedly shows Tony McCluskie disposing of the body of his sister Gemma in a suitcase

Gemma's dismembered torso was discovered in a suitcase and her limbs in plastic bags. Her head was discovered six months later and she was identified from dental records

Miss McCluskie’s torso was found in a suitcase in the Regent’s Canal in east London, followed by her limbs in plastic bags. Her head was found six months later.

The 29-year-old, who played Kerry Skinner, the niece of Ethel Skinner, in the BBC soap in 2001, was officially identified by dental records.

At her brother’s murder trial at the Old Bailey, the prosecution has said pot-smoking McCluskie bludgeoned his sister to death in the flat they shared after a row about an overflowing sink.

McCluskie, 35, today told the jury he had left a tap on early in the morning of March 1, 2012, sparking an argument and prompting his sister to call him later in the day and demand that he move out.

The Metropolitan Police released the footage today with the permission of the court. The trial is currently underway

When they were both later back in the house in Pelter Street, Shoreditch, east London, the argument continued and his sister came at him with a knife, he said.

McCluskie, wearing a tie and glasses, told the court she had threatened to stab him, his on-off partner Terri Arnull, and to make sure Ms Arnull’s son, who he viewed as his own, was taken into care.

'She started screaming and shouting at me, again calling me all the names: p****, w*****, c***, junkie,” he told the court.

'Calling me all the names, you know, saying that I should go and stay round Terri’s for a while. She just wanted me out the house.

'I kept on saying to her that I wouldn’t be leaving the house.

Mr McCluskie claims his sister had threatened him with a knife after a row

The brother of Gemma McCluskie, who was killed in March 2012, claimed his sister pulled a knife on him on the day she died

'She threatened to call the police, I told her to go ahead and that I still wouldn’t be leaving.

'I said she was making a big deal 
about things and if she was to come upstairs she would know that there 
was no damage done and she was making a big issue out of things.'

He said he walked upstairs, and called his sister to come and look at the bathroom.

'She came up the stairs, she was shouting, ‘are you gonna go, are you gonna go, are you gonna go?’.

'I turned round and she was standing there with a knife in her hand.'

He said she told him if he did not get out she would stab him, Ms Arnull, and have Ms Arnull’s son taken into care.

'I got very angry, I just couldn’t believe what I was hearing,' McCluskie told the court.

'All I remember is just grabbing her wrists. After that I have no recollection.'

He told the court the next thing he remembered was waking up the Saturday after his sister’s death on the Thursday.

McCluskie said he had no recollection of killing her, dismembering her, or clearing up afterwards.

He has admitted killing Ms McCluskie and has pleaded guilty to manslaughter, but denies murder.

He said: 'I accept what I have done 
is wrong, I take responsibility for what I have done to my sister, but 
it was never my intention to cause her any serious harm, let alone cause
her death.'

The court heard his defence is one of lack of intention, as well as loss of control.

McCluskie said that despite her 
bubbly exterior, behind closed doors his sister regularly insulted him, 
shouted at him and called him names.

He said when he left the tap on on 
the day of her death, there was more of the same as she screamed at him:
'F****** c***, you left the tap on.'

Asked what she was saying, he said: 
'That I was always off my nut, I was a junkie, I should be more careful 
about what I am doing, this was our mum’s house and if I can’t look 
after it I should go.'

He said he had tried to apologise, 
and pointed out the basin had only just overflowed and the small amount 
of water had gone on the bathroom rug.

Both went back to their bedrooms, and it was later on that day that Ms McCluskie phoned him asking him to leave, he said.

The trial continues.
