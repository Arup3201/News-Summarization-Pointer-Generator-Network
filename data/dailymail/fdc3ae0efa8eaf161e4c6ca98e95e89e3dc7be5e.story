Dr Charlotte Jones said the erotic Fifty Shades of Grey novels have led to older couples being more adventurous in bed

A rise in sexually transmitted diseases among older couples could have been caused by the ‘Fifty Shades of Grey effect’, a top doctor has warned.

Dr Charlotte Jones said the Fifty Shades of Grey Trilogy has led to older couples being more adventurous in bed and could explain a rise in sexually transmitted infections among the over-50s.

The film based on the best-selling erotic novels is due for release on Valentine's Day next year with Jamie Dornan in the role of billionaire Christian Grey.

Dr Jones, chairwoman of the British Medical Association's GP Committee, said the novels' success is giving couples more sexual confidence but warned that there was a risk they were failing to use protection.

She said: ‘When it comes to forgetting about safe sex we always think of the vulnerability of young people.

‘But there's the Fifty Shades of Grey effect where older people are being more explorative, but not necessarily remembering to use a condom.

‘Anyone, of any age, going into new relationships should be thinking about safe sex and particularly the role of condoms.

'People need to take care.’

Dr Jones revealed doctors are starting to see more cases of gonorrhoea and syphilis along with more common thrush and chlamydia.

She said: ‘I would always advise anyone who has got any symptoms to get them checked out, whether at a GUM clinic where they can be anonymous or with their GP.

‘Do not be embarrassed, we have seen it all before, it cannot come as a surprise to us.’
