An American climber has told how he was convinced he was going to die after tumbling some 70 feet into an icy crevasse on a Himalayan mountain with no hope of rescue.

Professor John All, 44, a professor of geography and environmental studies at Western Kentucky University, suffered several broken ribs and a fractured arm in the accident - and pleaded to be rescued on a desperate Facebook post.

Writing on the American Climber Science Program page, he said: 'Please call Global Rescue. John broken arm, ribs, internal bleeding. Fell 70 ft crevasse. Climbed out. Himlung camp 2. Please hurry.'

Lived to tell the tale: Western Kentucky University professor John All was rescued Tuesday after falling into a 
crevasse on a Himalayan mountain in Nepal

Plan B: All was planning to scale Mount Everest for a second time, but had to change his plans after last month's death of 16 Sherpa guides

It had taken him six hours to crawl out of the
 hole and another three hours to reach his tent. He spent the night in 
pain before rescuers reached him the next morning, he said in an 
interview in a Katmandu hotel where he is recovering.

After his initial plea for help on Facebook, All posted further status updates as the ordeal unfolded.

Another message said: 'GR can't find a helicopter so I'll try to survive tonight. I crawled back to tent. Unless the bleeding inside gets me, I should live.'

Nepalese officials say that three climbers are now presumed dead after being caught in an avalanche on the slopes of Mount Kanchenjunga, the world's third tallest peak.

Police official Meghraj Kadel says rescuers found no trace of an Indian climber and her two Nepalese Sherpa guides after they were hit by the avalanche at 7,300 meters (23,940 feet) on Wednesday.

The Indian was identified as 35-year-old Chanda Gayen, and her guides Temba and Dawa Wanju. They scaled Kanchenjunga on Sunday and were attempting to climb Yalung Kang, a sister peak.

In April, an avalanche hit a trail on Mount Everest, killing 16 Sherpa guides in the mountain's worst disaster that led to the cancellation of the climbing season because many Sherpa guides refused work.

Friend Wendy DeCroix replied: 'We are sending healing thoughts your way, John! Let us know if we can do anything on our end.'

Just before he was rescued, he wrote: 'Bleeding inside feels better but so cold. Pain meds running low. Longest night ever.'

All and his research team had moved to Mount Himlung in north central Nepal because the Mount Everest area was closed last month after the death of 16 Sherpa guides in an avalanche.

One of those Sherpa guides was from All's team. They were planning to climb Mount Lhotse, a sister peak of Everest. Climbers attempting to scale both the peaks share much of the route.

'I thought I was going to die, there was no way out. I was alone,' a bruised and bandaged All said describing his first thoughts after falling into the crevasse Monday. 'I landed on an ice ledge probably 3 feet wide which saved me from falling further into the crevasse.'

He broke five ribs and an arm, dislocated his shoulders, suffered internal bleeding and bruised his face and knees.

All shared a brief video on his Facebook page, which he recorded while being stranded in the crevasse.

ice and snow samples to study the level of pollution and rate of 
glaciers melting

The footage shows the 44-year-old climber with a bloody nose stuck in a narrow hole with snow and ice all around him. He narrates that he was lucky to land on a ledge.

'How the f*** do I get back up there though?' he wonders out loud with the camera pointing to the mouth of the crevasse 70 feet above him.Â 

All crawled out of the hole using his ice axe but because of his broken ribs and right arm he could only move very slowly. His teammates were in lower camps and would take two days to get to him.

Once he got out of the crevasse, All did not have a radio to call for help so he struggled his way back to the tent and barely made it inside. His Facebook pleas for help were sent using a satellite messenger.

A helicopter rescue team was eventually dispatched.

Undeterred: All plans to take a two-week break to recuperate before continuing on to Peru

'Because of bad weather the helicopter could not reach me on that day, so I knew I had to spend the night by myself,' he said adding the he spent hours bleeding and shivering. He suffered from frostbitten fingers.

The rescue helicopter landed in a flat area near the camp at the altitude of some 19,600 feet Tuesday.

The pilot and another rescuer dragged the 240-pounds, 6-feet 5-inches-tall All to the helicopter on a sleeping pad and flew him to a hospital in Katmandu where he spent the night in intensive care.

He said he checked out from the ICU the next day despite protest from doctors who wanted to keep him for a week.

In a status update Wednesday, All thanked the members of his team who helped him make it out of the icy hole alive. Looking back on his ordeal, the 44-year-old climber said that having a dislocated shoulder for 32 hours was the worst part.

The geography researcher and alpinist from Bowling Green, Kentucky, plans to stay at his hotel in Katmandu for a couple of weeks to recover before heading to Peru next month for another climbing trip.

He is an experienced climber who scaled Mount Everest in 2010. An associate professor of geography at WKU, All and his team were collecting ice and snow samples to study the level of pollution and rate of glaciers melting.
