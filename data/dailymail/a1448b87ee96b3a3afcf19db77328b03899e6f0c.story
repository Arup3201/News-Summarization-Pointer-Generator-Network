MPs today rounded on John Bercow for complaining about 'yobbery' and 'public school twittishness' at Prime Minister’s Questions.

The Commons Speaker has written to David Cameron, Ed Miliband and Nick Clegg warning the public risk being alienated from democracy by the ya-boo nature of the weekly confrontation.

But Tory MPs hit back, accusing Mr Bercow of 'whining' and losing control of the Commons because of his 'bias' towards Labour, adding that one of his predecessors, Baroness Boothroyd, had never felt the need to complain.

Alarm: John Bercow has written to the leaders of the three main political parties to demand talks on improving PMQs

It follows MailOnline's revelation that 
members of the public have written to Mr Bercow criticsing him directly 
for his handling of PMQs.

Some viewers accused the Speaker of treating the Prime Minister ‘like a two-year-old’ and ‘appalling behaviour’ in letting Labour ‘get away with saying what they want’.

Despite PMQs being the only regular event in parliament to gain any signiciant number of viewers, Mr Bercow has railed against the wall of noise that faces Mr Cameron and Mr Miliband in particular as they clash over the despatch box.

But Tory MP Alec Shelbrooke compared Mr Bercow's troubles to predecessor Bettey Boothroyd who he said had 'no need to resort to whining' while Sarah Wollaston said it was up to the Speaker to not call people responsible for heckling.

Mr Bercow's letter to the party leaders comes in the wake of a string of boisterous and loud exchanges which, according to a recent study, is alienating the public.

But he also claimed 'good female' MPs were leaving Parliament - with the charged comment that they were 'less inclined to screech and shout'.

A Hansard Society report revealed that  67 per cent of respondents felt 'there is too much party political points-scoring instead of answering the question'.

Only 12 per cent agreed that 'PMQs makes me proud of Parliament'.

Anger: Bercow said people think Prime Minister's Questions (pictured) is very male, very testosterone-fuelled and, in the worst cases, full of yobbery and public school twittishness

How MailOnline revealed details of letters sent to Mr Bercow last year

Mr Bercow said he was not expecting 
MPs to behave like 'Trappist monks' and appreciated 'passions will be 
aroused' in the Commons.

But
 he added: 'There are people who think culturally the atmosphere is very
 male, very testosterone-fuelled and, in the worst cases, [full] of 
yobbery and public school twittishness'.

The Speaker told The Independent
 that he regretted that 'some very good female members of Parliament on 
both sides' are leaving the Commons at the next election, and added that
 women were generally 'less inclined to screech and shout'.

However MPs suggested the solution to the problem lay with Mr Bercow himself.

Tory Alec Shelbrooke wrote on Twitter: 'Bercow needs to look in the mirror. Betty [Boothroyd] never had the need to resort to whining.  His biased approach is why he's lost control of PMQ's.'

Sarah Wollaston, Tory MP for Totnes, said: 'Speaker could just stop calling the worst PMQ hecklers & ban the crap planted "helpful" questions.'

Douglas Carswell, Conservative MP for Clacton, also wrote on Twitter: 'New Bercow doctrine for  PMQs?: narks never called. Planted questioners told to sit down.'

Others on Twitter were divided. Walaa Idris said: 'Speaker Bercow's complaints about heckling MPs at PMQs doesn't make any sense when he has the power to decide which questions are asked.'

Marcus Stead said: 'What is John Bercow talking about? PMQs would be very dull without any jeering. Most views [sic] quite like it.'

WHAT VIEWERS SAID ABOUT PMQS IN LETTERS TO JOHN BERCOW

John Bercow has warned people against passing judgement on his marriage to reality TV star Sally.

Mrs Bercow recently grabbed the headlines when photographs emerged of
 her kissing DJ and personal trainer Clinton Oliver at a London 
nightclub.

When asked about 
the pictures, Mr Bercow said: 'Most people out there know that every 
family has its issues.

'All marriages are different from each other and I
 think that there's something to be said for people looking after their 
own business and allowing us to look after ours.

'People shouldn’t assume that they know what is right
 or that it is necessary for them to prescribe for others.

'Sally and I have known each other for a very long time and I think we’re quite capable of looking after ourselves.'

Mrs Bercow has also said in recent weeks: 'No marriage is perfect but ours works for us.'

Last year MailOnline revealed public disgust at ‘braying’ MPs during
 Prime Minister’s Questions is laid bare today, in a catalogue of angry 
letters to Mr Bercow which branded them morons, t**ts and a throwback to the 19th 
century.

Dozens of complaints were sent to the 
Speaker's office from September to November about the behaviour of 
heckling, insulting and 
guffawing MPs in the House of Commons.

While
 the postbag fell short of the ‘bucket loads’ which Mr Bercow boasted 
of receiving every week, it revealed some of the anger at Mr Cameron and Mr Miliband.

Mr
 Bercow has been dogged by bad publicity since taking up the role as 
Speaker, and he is seen by Tory MPs as being biased towards the Labour 
Party.

Letters, emails and web messages 
repeatedly accused MPs of behaving like football hooligans, naughty 
schoolchildren, ‘rowdy buffoons’, ‘morons’ and ‘braying donkeys’ who do 
not live in the real world.

It
 is claimed MPs behave like 19th century ‘public schoolboys’ who think 
they are still in the Bullingdon Club, the Oxford University dining 
society which counted Mr Cameron and George Osborne as members and is 
famed for smashing up restaurants.

However Mr
 Bercow himself also faced criticism, 
with one letter warning ‘revolution will be inevitable’ if he is 
unable to act to curb the noise.

A couple of 
letters even chided the Speaker for complaining that the public do not 
like the noisy hullabaloo every Wednesday at midday.

One email said: ‘I
 do not find the noise levels a problem at all; the microphones in the 
chamber do an excellent job of amplifying the voices of the speakers.

‘I
 would far rather listen to PMQs with the barracking and noise from the 
backbenchers, than having the Speaker interrupt the Prime Minister and 
the Leader of the Opposition when they are in mid-sentence.’
