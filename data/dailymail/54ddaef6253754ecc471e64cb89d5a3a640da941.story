The NYPD is investigating the leak of a gruesome video that shows a New York City subway train dragging a man to his death along the tracks.

The disturbing footage captures 23-year-old Nyrel Wade's last moments at Penn Station after he walks to the end of the platform and past a 'Do Not Enter' sign to urinate, just after 1am on Saturday.

As the Pratt Institute employee walks back, a train leaving the station hits him as he tries to edge around the sign and knocks him to the ground.

In the video obtained by the New York Post, Wade's body then becomes trapped between the platform and the train and is pulled into the tunnel.

The NYPD has said that the train driver nor the conductor saw the incident and Wade was found 15-feet into the tunnel by a transit worker later on Saturday morning.

The horrific footage was captured by an MTA security camera and the NYPD has said that is investigating who leaked the video, which has been watched 80,000 times on Facebook.

One source, who has watched the film told the New York Daily News that Wade's death is 'the most disturbing thing you have ever seen.'

The NYPD have said that Wade's family in the Bronx have been notified and friends have posted condolences online for the popular faculty member and amateur musician.

Investigators are currently waiting for the medical examiners report to determine whether alcohol played a part in the tragic accident. 

'Sadly, the video speaks for itself on the inherent dangers associated with unauthorized activity in the subway system,' said MTA spokesman Kevin Ortiz to the New York Daily News.

'We are also working with the NYPD to investigate who posted this video as there was a clear breach of protocol.'
