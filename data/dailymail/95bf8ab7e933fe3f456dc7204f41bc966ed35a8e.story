Spurs bound? Tottenham are in talks for Seattle Sounders right-back DeAndre Yedlin

Yedlin played against Tottenham during the club's pre-season tour and is expected to finish the current Major League Soccer season with Seattle before linking up with the Premier League side in January.

Roma had been considered favourites for his signature while Liverpool have also been linked.

The transfer could be completed on Friday.

Yedlin played for the MLS All-Stars in a 2-1 success over Bayern Munich in Portland on Wednesday night.

Talking about his proposed move to Tottenham he told the Seattle Times: 'Nothing is really finalised yet. I’m waiting, letting my agency handle it.'

Former Tottenham goalkeeper Kasey Keller, now 44, warned Yedlin against against a move to White Hart Lane especially if he is only cover for Kyle Walker.

‘Spurs is a tricky place to play,' said Keller. 'They’re a team that has a lot of turnover in players. Spurs are a team that has the money, and they are always looking for a bargain, but it’s a tough place to go,’ he told Goal.

‘I just want to see young American players play regularly, week in and week out. If that’s at Tottenham, great. But if it’s not, then it’s not the right move. It’s hard to develop if you don’t play.

‘I’m not sure DeAndre would even qualify for a work permit. He’s never started a game for the national team, [England] is a tough place to get a work permit.

‘My guess would be that if Tottenham is in the race, it would be to sign DeAndre and loan him out somewhere.’
