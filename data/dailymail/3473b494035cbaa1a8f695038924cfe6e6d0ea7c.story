With his fresh face, a club in his hand and a Nike cap on his head, it is clear to see who the young golfing prodigy pictured below is.

Rory McIlroy has grown up into the world's finest golfer at the age of 25 but the Northern Irishman was long marked as a star of the future.

McIlroy gave a glimpse of him on the course as a child by posting the picture on Facebook, along with the message: 'I guess I've always been Nike Golf #teamnike #throwbackthursday'.

He's right, so long as you ignore the time he was sponsored by Oakley and Titleist, among others - but we'll let him off.

It is uncertain how old McIlroy is at the time the picture was taken - the four-time major winner and reigning Open and US PGA champion declined to reveal that information.

But the Ulsterman looks a little older than when he first shot to prominence as a nine-year-old prodigy performing tricks and chipping golf balls into a washing machine on Irish TV.

McIlroy's famous appearance on the Kelly Show came after he had won the Under 10 World Championship in Florida.

He grew up playing at Holywood Golf Club, where he was the youngest member aged seven - the first of many records McIlroy has since broken. It is also said that he hit a 40-yard drive aged just two.
