Arrested: Oscar Chicas, whose daughter was left in his idling car and subsequently drove it into vehicles nearby

A father has been arrested after he left his two-year-old daughter alone in his car and she drove it into some parked vehicles.

Connecticut man Oscar Chicas, 33, was taken into custody by West Hartford Police on Saturday afternoon following the incident.

Police said that the car had been left idling and Chicasâ€™s daughter put it into drive.

The car then moved forward and rammed two other cars, resulting in minor damage.

Chicas was working with his brother on a disabled vehicle just a few feet away at the time of the accident, authorities said.

Luckily, the child was not injured as the speed involved was so low, according to Fox News.

Chicas has been charged with risk of injury and held on a $15,000 bond.

The two-year-old has been left with her uncle, who was at the scene.

Response: West Hartford Police charged Chicas with risk of injury
