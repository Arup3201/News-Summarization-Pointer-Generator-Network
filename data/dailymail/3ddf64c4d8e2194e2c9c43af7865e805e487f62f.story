Three drunken stockbrokers who brutally assaulted a clubber after they harassed his girlfriend have been jailed.

Archie Madden, 21, Vinny Sullivan, 22, and Simon Abouzaki, 30, repeatedly kicked Edward Blackman as he lay helpless on the ground outside the Rose Club in central London.

The victim was rushed to hospital but miraculously suffered only a black eye and bruises, Southwark Crown Court heard.

Madden - who counts The Only Way is Essex star James ‘Arg’ as a Facebook friend - was jailed for 60 weeks while Sullivan was locked up for 10 months.

Abouzaki, who once received a bravery award for assisting a girl who was being attacked, was jailed for a total of 18 months after a suspended sentence for possessing MDMA was activated.

A fourth broker, Faisal Khan, 22, who started off the shameful brawl by throwing two punches at Mr Blackman, was handed a community order with 150 hours unpaid work.

Sentencing, Judge Alistair Mcreath said: ‘I have been in criminal law for many, many years and over those years I have dealt with cases of murder where the attack on the deceased person is far, far less serious than the attack you perpetrated on Mr Blackman.

‘To put a man to the ground as three of you did and then to kick him as he lies on the ground is an exceedingly dangerous thing to do and people die because of it.

‘By sheer good fortune the injuries suffered by the victim of your attack were relatively slight and nothing like the injuries that they could have been.

‘It’s absolutely plain from the CCTV footage your intention was to cause him much greater harm than you actually did.

‘I don’t expect for a moment you recall that intention because you were the worse for drink.

‘I have no doubt that you are very sorry for what you did but I’m bound to say you are sorry for the predicament you find yourselves in rather than remorse for what you did.’

Sullivan and Madden appeared shocked as the sentences were passed while family and friends sobbed in the public gallery.

Abouzaki waved to his relatives while Khan showed no emotion.

Describing the attack on February 2, prosecutor Peter Zinner told the court: ‘Mr Blackman and his Norwegian girlfriend were together in a night club in the small hours of the morning.

‘The four defendants approached her and began to make suggestions to her that she might be interested in seeing rather more of them.

‘Mr Blackman intervened and asked them to stop, then the fight broke out. Mr Khan threw two punches but they didn’t cause any injury. Mr Blackman made off with the three others in hot pursuit.

‘He was then attacked by the group and subjected to numerous punches and kicks.

‘This was a sustained assault on a defenceless and helpless victim who suffered black eyes and bruising, not by design but by good fortune.’

Mr Blackman, from St Albans, told The Evening Standard that he thought his attackers were thugs in the wrong part of town and was astonished to find out they were stockbrokers. He called for them to be barred from working in banking.

He said: 'For someone to do what they did to me, you have to question how much of a responsible adult they are and their character. It was such a violent attack that I thought they must be thugs in the wrong part of London, but I was amazed when I found out they were stockbrokers. The violence was horrendous.

'It’s the lifestyle of people who are making a lot of money at a young age, in a short space of time. A lifestyle driven by alcohol, cars and women.

'It’s amazing that young brokers are trusted to manage large accounts – what checks are in place? They hopefully will not be allowed back into that industry.'

Brian Stork, defending Abouzaki, said he ‘bitterly regrets’ his behaviour and the harm caused to Mr Blackman.

Tim Brown, for Madden, told how the attack was an ‘isolated one off incident’.

Naeem Karbhari, for Sullivan, said he was ‘disgusted’ with himself and has since curtailed his drinking.

‘He hoped to calm things down but allowed himself to get involved.’

Michelle Denney, for Khan, added: ‘He is a broker and of good character.

‘His best mitigation is his limited involvement and remorse.’

Madden, of Epping, Essex; Sullivan, of Barking, Essex and Abouzaki, of Waterloo, South East London, all admitted assault occasioning actual bodily harm. Khan, of Woodford Green, Essex, admitted common assault.
