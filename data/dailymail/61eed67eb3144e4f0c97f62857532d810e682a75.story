Perhaps it just shows that robots can often do a much better job than us.

After Google’s robot-controlled cars travelled 160,000 miles without a hitch, it was always going to be a human that caused the first crash.

A Google self-driving prototype Toyota Prius went into another vehicle near the firm’s headquarters in Mountain View, California.

But the technology giant said the crash was the fault of a human at the car’s controls, with witnesses claiming it caused a five-car pile-up.

Google has been testing out the cars in California and Nevada and this was the first time one has had an accident.

The autonomous Prius was in a five-car pile-up bizarrely with two other Prius cars and two Honda Accord vehicles, reported Jalopnik.

Google’s car rear-ended another Prius that hit a Honda Accord, which struck another Accord that hit another Prius, witnesses said.

It’s not yet proven that a human was driving but experts say the car’s sensors, cameras and lasers would have avoided a collision.

However the crash could have been caused by a bug in the computer software, which does all the work while humans ride in the car.

’Safety is our top priority,’ a Google spokesman told Business Insider.

Tiffany Winkelman, whose brother was involved in the pile-up, told NBC Bay Area an ambulance was in traffic behind the accident.

Mountain View Police Department have not yet commented.
