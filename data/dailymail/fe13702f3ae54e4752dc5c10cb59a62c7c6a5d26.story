A woman says she delivered her own baby while her mother was driving her to a Pittsburgh hospital.

Heather Payo and her mother were driving from Clairton, Pennsylvania, to Magee-Womens Hospital of UPMC in Pittsburgh on Tuesday when Payo realised she wasn't going to arrive in time.

Payo says she ripped off her pants and delivered the infant, which she named Jessica Rose, by reclining the front passenger seat.

‘I couldn’t believe this was happening,’ says her mother, Robin Payo to WTAE-TV.

They were just minutes from the hospital on Bates Street where they pulled over.

‘There was she was, I caught her right with my left hand,’ said the stay-at-home-mum to WPXI-TV.

She weighed 6 pounds and 10 ounces, according to grandmother Robin, who says Jessica Rose is 'beautiful'.

The next thing they know, ‘Six guards and 20 people wearing scrubs came out.’

Heather lives with her fiance, Eugene Colclaser, who is also father to Jessica Rose.
