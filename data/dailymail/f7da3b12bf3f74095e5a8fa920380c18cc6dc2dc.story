Yesterday, the Mail published a poignant photograph of actress Angelina Jolie's family, showing how cancer has claimed the lives of many of her relatives, including her mother, aunt and grandmother.

Her mother, the actress Marcheline Bertrand, died of ovarian cancer at the age of 56 in 2007. Her grandmother Lois Bertrand died of cancer aged 45 and her aunt Debbie - her mother's sister - lost her battle with the disease at 61. 

This strong family history comes from a mutation of the BRCA1 gene, which dramatically raises the risk of ovarian and breast cancer.

Angelina revealed she's had her ovaries and fallopian tubes removed, after a preventative double mastectomy

To prevent herself following in the footsteps of her female relatives, Angelina last week revealed she's had her ovaries and fallopian tubes removed (she had a 50 per cent risk of developing ovarian cancer). This comes two years after a preventative double mastectomy because of her raised risk of breast cancer.

But while many people know that a greater risk of developing these cancers can be inherited, what is less well known is that it's not just down the female line; the risk can be passed on from your father's side of the family, too.

Catherine Murley, a 44-year-old commercial manager from Rugby, inherited a high risk of breast and ovarian cancer from her father as result of a faulty BRCA1 gene.

'I never knew you could inherit a breast and ovarian cancer gene from a male relative,' she says.

She only became aware of the faulty BRCA1 gene in her family tree last June, after suddenly hearing from her father Mike, 68, a retired teacher, after years of little contact.

'I received a text from my dad saying: "Can we talk?" ' she says.

Her parents divorced when she was four and her mother brought her up with her sister Sinead, 40, and brother Andrew, 39. 'When I phoned my dad that evening, he explained that my cousin - his sister's daughter - had been diagnosed with ovarian cancer, and the family had found out she had the inherited faulty BRCA1 gene,' she says.

'My aunt - her mother - had died of ovarian cancer when she was in her 40s. After my cousin was diagnosed at the age of 40, the rest of that side of my dad's family went for genetic testing.

'That's when my dad was found to be positive for the faulty gene.'

Catherine's father was told this meant he had a raised risk of prostate cancer and male breast cancer, and a slightly higher chance of pancreatic cancer.

He was concerned that the faulty gene could have been passed to his children.

'I was aware of the BRCA1 connection because I had a close friend with it who died from breast cancer,' says Catherine.

'But I assumed it was something related to women and didn't know it could be passed by men, too.'

It's a common misconception, says Dr Adam Rosenthal, a gynaecological oncologist at University College London Hospital.

'Unfortunately, many women and some doctors disregard the paternal side of the family. They don't recognise the importance of a pattern of cancers on their father's side, so denying themselves the opportunity for gene testing to clarify their level of risk.'

We all inherit two copies of every gene - one from our mother and one from our father. So if either parent has a mutant copy, a child has a 50 per cent chance of inheriting it.

Assuming it's just the mother's line that you need to worry about is an understandable mistake, says Dr Rosenthal, as these genes tend to cause female cancers.

'However, they are not passed down on the female sex chromosome, like some inherited diseases. Men carry them just as easily as women,' he says. 'But women are more vulnerable to the effects.' While a faulty BRCA gene raises a man's risk of prostate cancer to 10 to 25 per cent, they raise a woman's risk of ovarian cancer to 15 to 45 per cent, and the risk of breast cancer to 45 to 90 per cent.

'No one knows why the risk is higher in women, but it may relate to female hormones acting with the faulty gene to promote cancer,' says Dr Rosenthal, who is also consultant gynaecologist at Weymouth Street Hospital, London. He says it's crucial people are aware of any history of cancer in their family.

'Men need to be careful not to disregard their mother's side of the family in the same way women should not ignore their father's side,' he says.

'If you're in any doubt about the implications of a pattern of cancers in your family, discuss it with your GP. They can refer you for genetic testing.'

After hearing the news from her father, Catherine contacted her brother and sister, warning them they needed to be checked.

Her GP put her on a waiting list to have genetic testing. Her father had waited almost ten months to be tested, but Catherine didn't want to wait this long.

'I was 43, which felt quite old to find out you have faulty BRCA1,' she says. 'The thought of it kept me awake at night. My fear was that I might already have cancer - I knew ovarian cancer was notoriously hard to diagnose.'

It led to the commercial manager having ovaries and fallopian tubes removed and having a mastectomy

Symptoms include persistent pelvic and stomach pain, bloating and nausea after eating, as well as feeling full quicker.

Catherine paid £700 to have a test at a private screening clinic, which involved giving a blood sample.

There are hundreds of different mutations of the BRCA1 gene, but as she knew which mutation she might have - as it would be the same one as her father - the laboratory was able to speed up its analysis. Three weeks later, Catherine went back with her husband Martyn to be told her test results.

'I had a bad feeling from the outset,' says Catherine. 'But when the gene counsellor said I had the defective gene, I began to cry. I knew from that moment that my life was on a different path. I texted my dad and family straight away with my news.'

Catherine was told she was at equal risk of ovarian and breast cancer. But for reasons experts do not fully understand, in her family the mutant gene more commonly manifested itself as ovarian cancer in the female line and prostate cancer in men.

Women with a faulty BRCA1 gene can have annual mammograms to screen for breast cancer or have a preventative mastectomy. There is no reliable way to screen for ovarian cancer.

Catherine quickly decided what she wanted to do.

'My close friend who had the faulty BRCA gene relied solely on annual breast screening. She didn't make it. I wanted to take away any risk of getting either cancer through surgery while I still could.'

In September, she underwent keyhole surgery to remove her ovaries and fallopian tubes - the operation was performed by Dr Rosenthal.

Examination of the fallopian tubes revealed pre-cancerous cells.

'I felt it confirmed that I had made the right decision in pushing to have surgery as soon as possible,' says Catherine.

'No one could have said when the cells would have turned into something more serious.'

Two months later, she underwent a double mastectomy, with surgeons using tissue from her stomach to form new breasts. The breast tissue was found to be clear of cancerous cells.

A report published a few months ago in the Journal of the National Cancer Institute found more widespread genetic testing for cancer-causing mutations would save lives and reduce the amount spent on treating cancers.

The Eve Appeal, the UK charity dedicated to gynaecological cancer research, is calling for all women diagnosed with ovarian cancer to be tested for faulty BRCA genes.

Chief executive Athena Lamnisos says it would increase experts' understanding of these cancers and allow women to warn their family members, too.

Though her brother is still waiting for genetic testing, Catherine's sister heard shortly before Christmas that she, too, has the defective gene. She will undergo the same surgery as Catherine.

'I have thanked my cousin for alerting us,' says Catherine. 'I've been able to take action to protect myself from cancer.'
