Hong Kong police are investigating whether the British banker accused of slaughtering two prostitutes is schizophrenic, it was claimed today.

Rurik Jutting, originally from Cobham, Surrey, faces two charges of murder after police called to his flat found one woman with her throat slashed and another stuffed in a suitcase.

Cambridge-educated Jutting, 29, was earlier this week sent for two weeks of psychiatric tests to determine whether he's fit to stand trial.

But now the police inquiry has been reshaped by the suggestion he had been receiving treatment for schizophrenia before he even arrived in Hong Kong a year ago, reports The Times.

Detectives were working on an understanding that Jutting was first diagnosed with mental illness in his early 20s, said the paper, which cited sources 'close to the inquiry'.

Police were said to now be investigating whether Jutting may have stopped taking medication for his illness in recent months.

Hong Kong sex workers who knew him say he was a regular user of cocaine. Media reports have claimed small quantities of the drug were found in his flat.

Jutting appeared in a short court hearing in Hong Kong on Tuesday, charged with the women's murders.

The judge adjourned proceedings for two weeks while the psychiatric assessments are carried out and the banker was remanded in custody.

As he was taken away to a cell, Jutting - who reportedly earned £350,000 a year as a banker - was pictured chuckling to himself in the back of a prison van. Prison guards sat uneasily around him wearing surgical masks.

A lawyer for Jutting, who did not speak during the hearing, said he had not yet agreed to take part in a police reconstruction at the crime scene but did not rule out giving consent in future.

Victims: Seneng Mujiasih, 29, left, was found by police dying with wounds to her throat and buttocks. Officers later found the body of Sumarti Ningsih, 23, right, stuffed in a suitcase on Jutting's balcony

Sumarti Ningsih, 23, was found dead in a suitcase at Cambridge-educated Jutting's apartment in the former British colony's Wan Chai district last Saturday.

Police had been called to the property on Halloween night and first found 29-year-old Seneng Mujiasih with wounds to her throat and buttocks. She died a short time later.

Both of the victims' bodies have been repatriated to Indonesia. Miss Ningsih was buried yesterday. 

Jutting moved to Hong Kong from London in July last year and is understood to have quit his highly-paid job at Bank of America Merrill Lynch in the days before the incident.

Before leaving he appeared to have set a sinister automatic response for his email account at the bank.

The email response read: 'I am out of the office. Indefinitely. For urgent enquiries, or indeed any enquiries, please contact someone who is not an insane psychopath. For escalation please contact God, though suspect the devil will have custody (Last line only really worked if I had followed through).'
