 A Pennsylvania mother called the man who murdered her son 'the devil' and said she was 'satisfied' he would 'spend eternity suffering in hell' as he was sentenced on Friday to life in prison.

Hugo Selenski, 41, was convicted last month of two counts of first-degree murder for killing pharmacist Michael Kerkowski and his girlfriend Tammy Fassett in 2002 as part of a robbery plot.

Michael's mother, Geraldine Kerkowski, read from a statement during sentencing at the Luzerne County Courthouse in Wilkes-Barre, Pennsylvania, but frequently looked Selenski in the eye.

While Kerkowski expressed her contempt and hatred for him, Selenski glanced toward the rest of the victims' family members and appeared to smirk.

Kerkowski, 71, called Selenski a 'useless waste of space and air' and declared, 'You are going straight to hell.'

She said: 'I know I can be satisfied knowing you will spend eternity suffering in hell, because there is going to be an eye for an eye.

'Hugo, you know you will be right where you will belong, in hell with Satan because you are the devil in every sense of the word.'

Fassett's sister, Lisa Sands, told Selenski: 'I know you have no remorse for what you've done because I can tell by the look on your face right now.

'You get to see your family. 

'I have to go to a gravesite to see my sister. 

'Now do you really think that's fair?''

Selenski was charged with killing Kerkowski and Fassett in 2006 after beating two other homicide charges

Their bodies of Michael and Tammy Fassett were among at least five sets of human remains found in Selenski's yard in 2003.

Prosecutors said Selenski and a co-conspirator brutally beat Michael to compel him to reveal the location of tens of thousands of dollars he kept in his house, then used plastic flex ties to strangle him and Fassett.

Kerkowski, who considered Selenski his best friend, had pleaded guilty to running an illegal prescription drug ring and was about to be sentenced when he and Fassett were reported missing in 2002.

After Michael was already dead, Selenski approached his parents and claimed their son was alive and needed money to pay a new defense team.

They gave Selenski $60,000.

Kerkowski said: 'He knew he killed my son, and for a year he was at our door, looking for money, trying to make us believe that Michael was still alive.'

Judge Fred Pierantoni sentenced Selenski to consecutive life terms plus a maximum of 120 years, ensuring that Selenski will 'never again walk the streets of this commonwealth or this community'.

After his arrest, Selenski broke out of the Luzerne County Prison (above) by making a rope from bed sheets.

Selenski maintains his innocence and is planning an appeal.

His accomplice, 45-year-old Paul Weakley, pleaded guilty to federal charges and is serving life in prison, according to the Times-Tribune. 

Several months after his arrest, Selenski broke out of the Luzerne County Prison by fashioning a rope from bed sheets.

He pleaded guilty to escape charges and was sentenced separately Friday to a maximum of three years and five months in prison, time already served.

Selenski was charged in the deaths of Kerkowski and Fassett in 2006 after beating homicide charges for two of the other bodies found in the yard. 

The fifth set of remains recovered by police was too badly burned and could not be identified.
