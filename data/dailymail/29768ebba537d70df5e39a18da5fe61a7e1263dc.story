Joe Hart has called upon his Manchester City team-mates to prove they have the strength of character to defend the league title for the first time in the club's history.

After securing the Premier League title under Roberto Mancini in 2012, the club then relinquished the trophy far too easily to Manchester United, falling 15 points behind their neighbours by February as a mutinous dressing room became disaffected with the volatile Italian.

This time around, though, Hart insists that the players are utterly determined to retain the trophy that they won with Manuel Pellegrini last season. After failing to win five of their first 11 Premier League matches of the season - drifting eight points behind Chelsea - some feared it may be another insipid title defence.

City have since rediscovered their mojo in spectacular fashion, winning their last six Premier League matches and moving to within a hair's breadth of Chelsea.

'I take my hat off to anyone who has retained a title because it’s difficult,' the England goalkeeper said, 'We failed last time and we don’t want to do it again. We’re all aware of what happened last time.

'I think we’ve turned it around in the right situations. We’ve won ugly. Leicester last week, after a really really tough one in Rome, to go to Leicester and battle out a 1-0 was just as big as beating Roma. It was the same against Palace.

'Chelsea are a strong team but I think they appreciate and totally expect us to push them. I don’t think it’s any surprise we’re on their tails.'

'Winning the thing in the first place is really hard, you’ve got to be consistent, you’ve got to get through bad patches and you have to bounce back. We have to prove we’ve got everything we need.'

Hart is certainly proving his credentials, marshalling City's defence to four consecutive Premier League clean sheets. After signing a new 5-year deal with the club last week, the uncertainty of last season - when he was dropped by Manuel Pellegrini - seems a lifetime ago and he also accepts he has been pushed on by the signing of Willy Caballero.

'I'm really lucky that there have been good times and bad and that spell pushed me on, gave me a re-set mode. Now I'm feeling good about what I'm doing and I'm working hard, trying to improve all the time.'

'I feel in a good place,' Hart said, 'I feel I’m in a place where I should be and it’s a level I want to keep. We’re all aware that last season didn’t go according to plan for a tiny bit of the season but that makes me a better goalkeeper. I’m coming to a good age now and really enjoying being here.'
