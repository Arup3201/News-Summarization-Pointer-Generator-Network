Former Apprentice winner Stella English told yesterday how she has fallen into poverty and is trying to claim benefits.

Only three years after she found fame on the BBC1 show, she is down to her last £200, she could lose one of her homes and her marriage has collapsed.

Miss English, 34, outlined her financial plight as she fought off a claim by Lord Sugar, who was trying to win £35,000 in legal costs and damages.

New case: Lord Sugar, pictured (left) arriving at an earlier employment tribunal, is suing Stella English (pictured today, right), after the Apprentice winner tried to sue him for constructive dismissal

The business tycoon had been seeking 
to recover the cash after she lost her constructive dismissal case 
against him earlier this year.

Miss English wept yesterday when an East London Tribunal Service panel ruled that she should not have to repay any of the money.

At
the original employment tribunal, Lord Sugar claimed Miss English 
knowingly lied when she said the £100,000-a-year job at his firm, which 
she won through the BBC programme in 2010, was a sham.

Recently,
she claimed she was making double that amount from new business 
ventures, including a fashion label and an events company.

But
yesterday it emerged that the mother of two has not worked since July 
and is attempting to claim housing benefit and jobseeker’s allowance.

She
said that she worked at Citigroup until July, earning £500 a day, but 
her contract with the banking giant had ended.

She is also facing the 
prospect of having one of her homes repossessed and has seen her 
marriage collapse as a result of the stress of the original case.

Miss
English told the tribunal yesterday that she now only has around £200 
in her bank account and was unable to even afford a birthday present for
her son.

‘I cannot afford 
to feed my kids let alone pay the mortgage – that doesn’t even matter 
any more,’ she said. ‘It is my son’s birthday today but I can’t afford 
to buy him anything because everything we have goes on trying to 
survive.

‘A couple of weeks 
ago I made an application for housing benefit and there is an interview 
set up. I have no choice.

'Unless I find a contract I will not be able to
support my family any more, I am losing close to 3k a month.’

She
added: ‘One of my homes is about to be repossessed, the bailiffs are 
booked on October 8. The immense pressure as a result of the tribunal, 
and in particular, statements made by the respondent [Lord Sugar] 
attacking my credibility has been a major contributor to the breakdown 
of my marriage.

Stella English married Ray Dewar (pictured) in 2011 but claims their marriage has collapsed due to stress

‘I feel unfairly penalised for standing up to such a powerful opponent.’

Miss
English had told an original tribunal hearing that she gave up an 
£85,000-a-year City job to work for Lord Sugar, but had to quit inside 
six months because she felt like ‘an overpaid lackey’.

She
had claimed that on her first day at work she was told: ‘The cameras 
have stopped rolling now… Welcome to the real world, there is no job.’

Miss
English also said she felt ostracised while she worked at Viglen, which
supplies IT equipment to schools, universities and hospitals.

But the tribunal ruled in April that there was no evidence to support her allegation that she was unfairly treated.

At the time, Lord Sugar described the ruling as a victory against ‘ambulance-chasing lawyers’.

Yesterday,
lawyers for 66-year-old Lord Sugar insisted Miss English brought the 
original legal action against him simply because she was ‘bored’ with 
her day job and missed the glamour of appearing on television.

But
tribunal judge George Foxwell rejected his application to recover some 
of his costs, saying that Miss English truly believed she had a case.
