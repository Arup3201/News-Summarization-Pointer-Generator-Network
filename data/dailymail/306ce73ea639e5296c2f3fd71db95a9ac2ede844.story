Police are set to call in specialist interviewers to speak to the south Auckland school children who saw one of their classmates stabbed by another pupil.

An 11-year-old boy remains in a critical but stable condition in Auckland's Starship Hospital after he was injured during a fight at  Pacific Christian School in Mangere, south Auckland on Tuesday.

The boy has a head injury, but police said they can't comment further about the specifics of the injury or how it was inflicted.

It's been reported he was stabbed in the head with a pair of scissors by a boy of a similar age when the fight broke out around 11.30am.

Police and Child Youth and Family (CYF) are working with the 11-year-old boy believed to be involved in the fight and police say the boy's parents are cooperating fully to manage his ongoing care.

The stabbing was witnessed by a number of the boys' classmates and a joint police, CYF and Ministry of Education team will be working with those children and their families over the coming days to conduct interviews and provide them with the support.

Due to the ages of the children, specialist child interviewers will be required.

Police hope to complete their scene examination at the school on Wednesday.

Pacific Christian School has been open since 2005, when it began as a pre-school and primary school before it expanded enrollment to include intermediate and secondary grades.

The school is understood to be run by the Tokaikolo Christian Church, a well-known Tongan church in Mangere, Auckland.

According to The New Zealand Herald, the church made headlines in back in 2012 when the president came under fire for calling on the congregation to raise money for the church, believed to be around $100,000 a month.
