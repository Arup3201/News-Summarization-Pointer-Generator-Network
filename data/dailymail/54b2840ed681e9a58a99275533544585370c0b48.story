Death: Lamarni Hylton-Reid, 20, died in hospital less than two hours after being stabbed in London

A 17-year-old boy was last night charged with the murder of a 20-year-old man stabbed to death in a street.

Lamarni Hylton-Reid was found in Hackney, east London, at 5.10pm on Wednesday. He was taken to hospital by ambulance but pronounced dead at 6.30pm.

Scotland
Yard said yesterday that the 17 year old had been charged with murder 
and threatening a person with a blade or sharply pointed article in a 
public place.

He is set to appear at Highbury Corner Magistrates' Court in north London this morning.

A
19-year-old man arrested for assisting an offender has been bailed 
pending further investigation. A post-mortem examination gave cause of 
death as a stab wound to the chest.

The
motive behind the killing is not yet known, although local residents 
claimed last week that the death happened following an argument over a 
£5 note.

Messages paying 
tribute to Mr Hylton-Reid, of Clapton, east London, have flooded onto 
Twitter, including one post which said he was stabbed on the way to 
visit his mother on her birthday.

Anyone
with details on the death at the junction of Homerton High Street 
and Kenworthy Road, was asked to call the incident room on 020 8345 3865
or Crimestoppers anonymously on 0800 555 111.
