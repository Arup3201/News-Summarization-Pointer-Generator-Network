Women wear bras all day every day for the whole of their adult lives, going through hundreds of different styles. But you won't have ever worn one quite like Asda's latest model.

The Abacadabra promises to boost your bust by two cup sizes - nothing new there. However, it also has a 'lighter than air' feel which makes it more comfortable than the other push-up bras available. Better still, it costs just £6.

The secret to the bra's success is all 
in the design. George at Asda enlisted the help of a former aerodynamic 
engineer to come up with a new form of underwear.

Abracadabra: George's new range of bras, designed by aerodynamic 
engineer Antonio Padula, are filled with an injectable mould which 
doesn't move around, making it more comfortable

Antonia Padula filled the bra with an injectable mould which is one solid cup rather than inserts which can move around and become uncomfortable.

It’s brand new technology which was crafted to fit the curve of a woman’s body perfectly - as well as boosting the bust.

The collaboration between George and Padula is a response to a survey which found that more than half of the female population are unhappy with the size of their bust.

Seventy-five per cent of 20-29 year old women surveyed admitted to wearing ‘push-up’ bras on a daily basis, with 48 per cent of women under 29 specifically wanting to make their bust larger.

Further research showed new mothers are most concerned with the look and size of their cleavage - 69 per cent said they would like to improve their chests.

There are other ways to boost your bust, but women aren't quite as keen on them...

75 per cent of 20-29 year old women admitted to wearing a push-up bra every day

23 per cent cited exercise as a preferred solution to their bust worries

11 per cent are considering going under the knife

10 per cent are willing to give a bust firming cream a try

Padula, an ex-mechanical engineer turned technological bra designer, created a bra that addresses the concerns of women who find push up bras too uncomfortable (15 per cent) and those who find them ineffective (87 per cent).  

A master of understanding the importance of curvature and shape following years in the aerodynamics engineering industry, Padula's Abracadabra was created to feel ‘at one’ with women’s curves, while still giving an enhancement of two sizes.

The bra uses innovative ‘A2S’ technology, which means that it is made up of a single component injected mould rather than the usual multiple layered, padded insert or air filled cups. 

This technology streamlines the bra's shape for an instantly larger and lifted look while remaining discreet underneath clothing.   

George Brand Director Fiona Lambert said: 'As ever we continue to strive to be the first to market with innovative and problem solving solutions for both women and men. 

'The Abracadabra is as magic as its title professes. It enhances, uplifts and enlarges the bust area by two sizes through its remarkable technological engineering.'
