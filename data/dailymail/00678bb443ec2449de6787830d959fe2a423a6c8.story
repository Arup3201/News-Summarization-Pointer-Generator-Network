A senior Labor frontbencher has broken ranks and says new anti-terror laws that allow journalists  to be jailed for reporting on intelligence operations might have overstepped the mark. 

Tony Abbott's Parliament beefed up the domestic spy agency ASIO's powers earlier this month.

Journalists will face 10 years in jail if they reveal details of intelligence operations.

Labor frontbencher Anthony Albanese has spoken out saying new anti-terror laws that allow journalists to be jailed for reporting on intelligence operations might have overstepped the mark

Tony Abbott and Parliament beefed up Australia's terror laws this month 

Mr Albanese has now hit out at the lack of scrutiny over the measures, describing the penalties on the media as draconian.

The party's spokesperson on Infrastructure, Transport and Tourism, said there was public interest in exposing errors of security agencies.

'You can be fully supportive of our engagement in the Middle East and still say we don't protect freedom by giving it up,' Mr Albanese told Sky News. 

Lobor backbencher Melissa Parke was the lone voice of dissent in Parliament when the new laws went through

'I'm concerned about the rights of journalists.'

Mr Albanese's concerns may be too little too late.

Labor waved the bill through parliament, citing bipartisan support for national security, and backbencher Melissa Parke was the lone voice of dissent.

Mr Albanese said he was speaking for himself and not Oppostion Leader Bill Shorten in his comments 

Asked if Opposition Leader Bill Shorten shared his concerns about press freedom, Mr Albanese said: 'I'm speaking for myself. 

'Sometimes things might have gone too far. If that is the case they should be wound back.'

The second tranche of anti-terror laws cracking down on Australians who go overseas to fight alongside extremists will be debated in parliament in mid-October.

'We should be arguing for more scrutiny of these issues,' Mr Albanese said.

Security agencies are trying to impose things that have been in their bottom drawer for a long time, he said.
