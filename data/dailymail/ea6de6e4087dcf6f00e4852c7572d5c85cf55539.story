Coast to pole: Parker Liautaud, 19, plans to make the fastest trip of all time to the South Pole on foot and skis

A 19-year-old Yale sophomore who spends his free time as a polar explorer plans to attempt to set a new record for fastest time South Pole, with a 397-mile trek by foot and ski that will begin Sunday.

Parker Liautaud, 19, of Palo Alto, California, plans to televise the trek, which he aims to complete in 22 days, using a satellite support truck that will follow him and his teammate at a distance.

Liautaud has three times hiked to the North Pole and says he hopes the danger fraught journey will draw attention to climate change.

The team's plane landed in Antarctica on Tuesday.

If he makes it, Liautaud will also become the youngest person to ever have reached both the north and south poles.

‘I
 have to be prepared to pull a sled that weighs approximately 180 pounds
 for 12 hours a day for nearly a month,’ Liautaud said.

The team plans to make it to their goal on or around New Years Day.

Liautaud,
 who is studying geology, will start on foot at the Ross Ice Shelf on 
Antarctica's Northwestern coast, switching to skis when he and his 
teammate reach the Leverett Glacier.

Traveling
 18 miles a day, they aim to reach the Pole in 22 days. The current 
record is 24 days, one hour and 13 minutes and was set by Christian Eide
 of Norway in 2011.

Good company: Liautaud has made several trips to the North Pole and will be accompanied to the South Pole by veteran explorer Doug Stoup

Double record: If 19-year-old Liautaud makes it, he'll become the youngest person to ever reach both the North and South Poles

Insurance
 broker Willis Group is sponsoring the trip, which begins after months 
of preparation. The group, which also includes Liautaud’s teammate and 
veteran polar explorer Doug Stoup, is dubbed the Willis Resilience 
Expedition.

Liautaud's 
training regimen includes working out on a rowing machine while wearing a
 70-pound vest. He's eating 6,000 calories a day, which he will maintain
 in Antarctica.

Liautaud
 said he is aware of the dangers he will face, which include 
temperatures as low as -76 Fahrenheit and possible whiteout conditions.

‘After
 two years of careful planning and preparation, we are finally ready to 
start our journey to the South Pole,’ Liautaud said in a release.

He
 continued: ‘This expedition aims not only to set a new world record, 
but we will also collect data, which will contribute to better 
understanding our changing world. I am hugely excited about the 
challenges that lie ahead and hope that people will track our progress 
on the expedition website where you can follow our journey and join the 
debate on climate change.

On
 his first trek to the North Pole, when Liautaud was 15, his team leader
 called for an emergency evacuation just 15 miles from the end, when 
they reached a stretch of open water.

‘It felt like a slap in the face,’ Liautaud said. ‘But I know better and I'm prepared better now.’

The
 group’s progress will be tracked every step of the way by a 2.6 ton 
custom designed 6x6 Toyota Hilux truck which is equipped with satellite 
transmission capabilities and is dubbed The Ice Broker.

Portions
 of the trip will be broadcast on the group’s website and 16 separate 
one-hour shows are currently planned through December 23.

The team hopes to reach the South Pole on or around New Years Day
