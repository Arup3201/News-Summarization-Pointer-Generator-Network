West Ham will sport a newly-designed crest when they move to the Olympic Stadium from the start of the 2016-17 season.

The Hammers conducted a number of online polls amongst supporters to garner opinions on a modern, simplistic design to coincide with the move away from Upton Park in two years' time - with a slight majority voting in favour of the change.

The new crest sees the castle removed from the current design, with 'London' added in an attempt to attract a wider market as the club made a number of small alterations following feedback from fans.

Proposal: The new badge, with the word London prominent on it, has been put to fans for approval

'West Ham 
United are pleased to report that an independent supporter poll, 
conducted by SMG YouGov, shows that fans have voted in favour of 
adopting the Club's updated crest design,' the club announced on their 
website.

'Of
 the two supporter polls, SMG YouGov reported that 77 per cent of fans 
were supportive of evolving the Club's crest. The Club therefore had a 
clear mandate for change. When presented with the new crest's design, 72
 per cent of West Ham fans who support change, also voted to adopt the 
new crest design.

'SMG
 YouGov's report confirmed that the second stage of the process 
attracted new respondents and new opinions, while the results showed 
that an overall 56 per cent majority of fans voted 'yes', in clear 
support of adopting the new crest.

'The
 primary, full-colour flat and mono executions...will be the most widely
 used and will grace the playing shirt from 2016. We are also pleased to
 report that the popular blue shield with claret hammers will be adopted
 as a secondary colour-way.'

The
 new crest is another step away from tradition for the east London club 
who will leave the Boleyn Ground, their home for the last 110 years, to 
take up anchor residency of the Olympic Stadium in Stratford.

Co-chairmen
 David Sullivan and David Gold issued a statement thanking supporters 
for their input, which read: 'As a board, we always put the fans' 
feelings at the heart of our decision making. This is an emotive issue 
and we have said from the outset that if supporters did not vote for 
this crest then there would be no change.

Evolution: The current badge, as seen on new signing Diego Poyet, is the 15th version of the crest

'From
 all the emails and tweets we have seen, there are clearly thousands of 
different opinions out there. But ultimately, the fans have spoken. We 
are pleased to have found a route that has been endorsed by the majority
 of fans so we now plan to follow that guidance.'

Meanwhile
 vice-chairman Karren Brady, who played a major part in securing the 
Olympic Stadium move, believes the tie-in with a new crest is crucial to
 develop the club.

Changing times: The proposed badge will be the 16th evolution of the West Ham crest

'Our
 priority now is to continue to work with supporters to ensure that when
 we make our momentous move in 2016, the Olympic Stadium looks and feels
 like home.

'This
 has always been and remains a guiding principle for the board in the 
lead up to the move. Millions of pounds are being invested to make sure 
the stadium exceeds fans' expectations come the first game of the 
2016-17 season.

'The
 approval of the new crest is a significant step forward in this process
 and I would like to reiterate my thanks to the thousands of supporters 
who played their part in helping to devise what will be the 16th crest 
in our 119-year history.'
