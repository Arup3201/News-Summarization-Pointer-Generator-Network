Musical star Sarah Brightman is expected to blast off in October for a 10-day
stay on the International Space Station, NASA has confirmed.

The famed soprano, who starred in Andrew Lloyd Webber's Phantom of the Opera, will pay about £34million ($52million) for a
round-trip ride aboard a Russian Soyuz capsule, said U.S.-based
Space Adventures, the privately owned firm arranging the
trip.

Brightman, 54, will become the eighth tourist and first
professional singer to visit the orbital outpost, a $100billion
research laboratory that flies about 260miles (418km) above
Earth.

Since NASA retired its space shuttles in 2011, Russian Soyuz
capsules have been fully booked flying crew to and from the
station, which is a project of 15 nations.

The last tourist to fly was
Cirque du Soleil founder Guy Laliberte, who spent 11 days aboard
the station in 2009, at a cost of about $35 million.

A Soyuz seat for a paying passenger is available this fall
because Russia needs to supply a fresh capsule to bring home two
station crewmen who are planning to make unprecedented year-long
stays in space. Soyuz capsules are designed to stay in orbit for six
months.

Cosmonaut and incoming station crewmember Sergey Volkov will
pilot the replacement Soyuz that will carry European Space
Agency astronaut Andreas Mogensen and Brightman, NASA flight
director Emily Nelson said.

Brightman will spend 10 days aboard the International Space Station (pictured), NASA has said

Brightman arrived in Russia this week and was scheduled to
begin a nine-month training program yesterday, but it was
postponed until next week so she could recover from a cold,
Russia's ITAR-TASS news service reported.

A second aspiring space tourist, Japanese entrepreneur
Satoshi Takamatsu, also arrived at Russia's Star City training
center to prepare for a spaceflight.

TASS reported that he will
serve as Brightman's backup if she is unable to make the trip.
