The Consumer Product Safety Commission will likely ban the small but dangerous high-powered magnets known as 'Buckyballs' from the market after one child died another 7,700 were taken to the emergency after swallowing them.

The startling figures were released this week as part of a proposed final rule to rid the rare-earth magnets from the shelves completely.

Anything considered to be of choking hazard size would be removed as part of the recommendation, which will be decided by vote later this month, according to USA Today.

The proposal follows the death of 19-month-old Annaka Chaffin, who swallowed seven of the balls from a necklace her brothers brought home from school last August.

Tragic: Annaka Chaffin was only 19-months-old when we swallowed seven 'Buckyballs' from a necklace and died. Some 7,700 other children have been rushed to hospital for doing the same thing, a report moving to ban the magnets has revealed.

Dangerous: Buckyballs come in a set of 216 rare-earth magnets that are extremely strong and can be manipulated into sculptures and chain jewelry

Annaka was found unresponsive and bleeding from the mouth and nose.

According to the final rule, an autopsy showed the magnets had become attached to one another in her small intestine, which perforated her bowel and caused it to become septic.

'This case illustrates how difficult it is to diagnose the injuries associated with ingested magnets: the symptoms seemed to indicate a common stomach ailment or poisoning,' the CPC staff report said, according to USA Today.

The Consumer Product Safety Commission will allow magnets that do not fit through a certain cylinder to remain on the market.

In July a type of the magnets, made by the popular brand Buckyballs, were recalled.

Buckyballs founder, Craig Zucker, dissolved the Buckyballs company in December 2012.

However he now has a new company, United We Ball, which is believed to have the only magnetic product that would be allowed under the proposed new rule.

In December, a Florida teen was rushed to hospital after accidentally swallowing two of the magnets.

Christin Rivas, 14, was given six of the magnets by a church friend just before Thanksgiving, and took them to her school in Melbourne to 'freak out' her friends with tricks such as pulling a pen up a wall from a neighboring classroom.

However while going to the bathroom she put them in her mouth, and when someone in the next stall made her laugh, she accidentally swallowed them.

Not a toy: Magnet-related emergency room visits have increased five times since 2002, and been linked with one death

Buckyballs come in a set of 216 magnets that can be manipulated into sculptures and chain jewelry.

After three days in hospital, the balls had become stuck in Rivas' small intestine, risking perforation and infection of the tissue.

The balls she swallowed were made of neodymium - a material that begins to chip and erode in stomach acid.

After five days in hospital, Christin was finally released.

Rare-earth magnets pose 'unique health hazards to children,' according to the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention.

Since 2003, one death and 19 injuries - often requiring gastrointestinal surgery - have been reported.

Between 2002 and 2011, magnet-related emergency room visits among people under 21 increased five fold - a total of 22,500 cases.

Irresistible: The tiny magnets have proven tempting for children and kids swallowing them or putting them up their noses has resulted in a huge increase in magnet-related injuries
