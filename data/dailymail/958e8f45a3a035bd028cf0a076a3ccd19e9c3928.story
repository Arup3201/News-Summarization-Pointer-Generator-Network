It seems nowhere is safe from the prying eyes of the Russian state as it hosts the Sochi Winter Olympics.

A government official has let slip that hotel guests are being monitored by covert surveillance cameras - even in the shower.

Russia's Dmitry Kozak, deputy prime minister responsible for Olympic preparation, revealed that authorities have video from hotels showing that people leave the water on.

'We have surveillance video from the hotels that shows people turn on the shower, direct the nozzle at the wall and then leave the room for the whole day,' he said, according to the Wall Street Journal.

The astonishing revelations came when 
Mr Kozak was confronted by journalists about the poor state of 
facilities around the Olympic Village.

The
 Sochi Games have been hit by complaints that accommodation blocks were 
incomplete, the plumbing was malfunctioning, floors not laid, hotel 
rooms left without door handles.

The
 list of bizarre and sometimes amusing faults has even spawned its own Twitter account called Sochi Problems which has been flooded with 
examples of the unsatisfactory conditions.

But Mr Kozak tried to brush off the 
problems, insisting they were blown out of proportion by a biased 
Western media. And, he claimed, he had video proving it.

He said his surveillance footage showed people sabotaging the facilities.

Mr Kozak was quickly whisked away by other officials before anyone had a chance to question him further on the level of spying.

His
 spokesman, Ilya Dzhus, has tried to quell the storm provoked by the 
extraordinary claims, saying that 'no such thing was ever said'.

He called the report a fantasy, a joke, or a mistranslation.

Hotels
 have video surveillance of entrances for security purposes, he said, 
and some rooms had video surveillance during construction.

But never the bathrooms, Dzhus insisted, adding: 'You can check yourself'.

Â 

This scandal is just the latest in a string of damaging reports about Russian President Vladimir Putin's showcase Games.

Today it was reported it appears that there are not enough pillows for the athletes in the Olympic Village.

Luiza Baybakova, a member of the catering staff for the games, posted a photo of the news on her Instagram feed.

The sign reported by Voactiv read: 'Attention dear colleagues! Due to an extreme shortage of pillows for athletes who unexpectedly arrived to Olympic Village in the mountains, there will be a transfer of pillows from all apartments to the storehouse on 2 February 2014. Please be understanding. We have to help the athletes out of this bind.'

The news suggests the athletes turned up before schedule or that the planners had not ordered enough to accommodate the numbers.
