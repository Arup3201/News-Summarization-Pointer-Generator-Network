Britain’s supermarket 'price war' has been revealed as a sham, with chains increasing the costs of thousands of products, despite promising lower prices.

Asda and Tesco have spent millions publicising falling price tags for shoppers so far this year.

But in a ten-week period since February 23, the two retail giants and Sainsbury’s reduced the price on 3,057 items, but increased it on 3,653, industry analysts have revealed.

The supermarket giants reduced the price on 3,057 items but increased it on 3,653, industry analysts have revealed. Only Sainsbury's lowered a greater number of products

Sham: Tesco, which uses the slogan 'prices down and staying down' has cut 1,012 price tags but hiked up 1,350 others

Sainsbury’s, who recently played down the price war, can boast more reductions than increases - 965 items are down and 704 are up.

And Morrisons have cut more than double the number of products it increased, having recently announced a further 1,200 price cuts under a new 'I'm cheaper' campaign.

The others, who have been the loudest in their claims, cannot say the same, revealed data from analysts BrandView.com for industry journal The Grocer.

Asda have said they are spending £1billion over the next five years to cut prices, but since February 23 it has cut the cost of 1,080 items and increased it on 1,599.

Tesco, which uses the slogan ‘prices down and staying down’ has cut 1,012 price tags but hiked up 1,350 others.

According to the research, many 
products would be cheaper if customers take up special offers and deals,
 such as Buy One Get One Free promotions.

But
 excluding these, rises outnumber cuts on the shelves of the nation’s 
biggest retailers, despite the much publicised price war, said study.

Lowering prices: Sainsbury's, who recently played down the price war, can boast more reductions than increases - 965 items are down and 704 are up

The retail giants claim the cuts are to the most popular items such as bread and milk and eggs which means the average basket of groceries does cost less now.

The Grocer said: ‘Overall, they (the Big Four) have actually increased more prices than they have cut.

‘Prices have fallen when looking at a basket of 60 of the biggest selling products by value across alcohol, health, fresh, ambient, frozen, household and toiletries.’

Sainsbury’s chief executive Justin King recently described his company’s policy as ‘price skirmishes’ rather than a price war.

As a result, the supermarket has more price cuts than price rises but the cost of a basket of the top 60 goods at Sainsbury’s is up 2.5 per cent in the same period.

The same basket is down 7.7 per cent at Asda and 2.4 per cent at Tesco.

A spokesman for Tesco said: ‘Our own data covers 40,000 products and clearly shows that our prices overall have come down over this period.

‘On top of that, our price cuts are focused on the products that customers buy most often, like bread, milk and eggs and are down by an average of 24 per cent.’

An Asda spokesman said: 'The price of some products does change from time to time for various reasons including seasonality but two years ago, we locked the price of every day essentials and since then those prices have stayed the same, such as four pints of milk at £1, which is why we’re nearly 8% cheaper in this survey.'‬

An earlier version of this article included Morrisons among the supermarkets that have increased more prices than they cut in the recent ‘price war’. In fact, Morrisons has cut more than double the number than it increased before and after promotions. We are happy to clarify this.
