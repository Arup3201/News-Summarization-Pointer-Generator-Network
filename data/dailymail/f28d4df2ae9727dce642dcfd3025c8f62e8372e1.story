Tottenham will face Besiktas in group C while Everton have drawn Lille and Wolfsburg in group H of the Europa League after the tournament draw in Monaco.

Spurs take on the Turkish side their north London rivals Arsenal relegated to European club football's second tier, along with Belgrade club Partizan and Greece's Asteras Tripolis. 

Everton's group of Wolfsburg and Lille was completed by Russia's FC Krasnodar.

A couple of eye openers there. Besiktas are heading back to north London, but it's not to face Arsenal again, but their north London rivals Tottenham.

Everton face tricky ties in France and Germany, while Celtic avoid the Premier League contingent and a fiery rematch with Legia.

UEFA's director of competitions Giorgio Marchetti is on the stage and explaining how the draw will take place. Scroll down to (11.20) to read how this will be done.

the draw will start very shortly, so stay tuned.

There is a good reason though, folks for Dudek's appearance. The 2015 Europa League final will be held in Poland's National Stadium in Warsaw (yes, the one which flooded for England's clash there a couple of years ago.) The former Liverpool and Poland keeper is the final ambassador and will help conduct the draw.

...but at least it's relevant. UEFA's general secretary lets us know the new rules to this year's draw which include the winner taking part in next season's Champions League. Now that's a carrot to dangle in front of a few sides.

A good indication that this draw will actually get underway soon...

Because on comes to the stage Youri Djorkaeff who won a pretty big trophy in 1998 (no, not just the World Cup) but the UEFA Cup with Inter Milan... which to you young folk out there is basically the Europa League.

Well, I suppose I will have to give you both. The good news is the presentation ceremony is underway at the Grimaldi Forum, but with no sign of UEFA general Secretary Gianni Infantino, the draw won't start just yet - instead we will get a seemingly endless highlights reel from last season's action (JUST GET ON WITH IT!)

Tottenham were in action last night as they strolled to a 3-0 victory over AEL to win 5-1 on aggregate, but it was disaster for Hull who were eliminated by Lokeren on away goals, despite winning 2-1 at the KC Stadium and drawing 2-2 in the tie.

All three British clubs in the draw today could face the Belgian outfit who are in pot four.

The pots are decided by UEFA ranking, but how can Everton only be in pot three when they finished above Tottenam (top seeds) in the Premier League last season?

It's a matter of consistency folks. Form over five years is taken into account and Spurs' constant European presence stands them in good stead.

Is it fair? Maybe not, and on that note it's worth reading Martin Samuel's excellent column which covers UEFA's ranking system following yesterday's deja-vu Champions League draw.

Legia Warsaw of course knocked Celtic out of the Champions League in the third qualifying round a few weeks back, but were penalised by UEFA for a technical infringement.

Celtic then took their place in the play-off round, Warsaw were dumped into Europa League.

But with Celtic being knocked out of the premier competition (again) these two sides could now meet again in the Europa League group stage. It could be a hostile encounter going by this banner seen from Warsaw's play-off win over Aktobe.

(How do you get a banner that big inside a ground?)

It's quite simple folks, in fact, it's A LOT more simple than the number system from the play-off round which just about left me shaking in the corner while laying in fetal position.

One team will be taken from each of the below four pots to make one group. The major restriction is no side can play a side from their association - so that rules out a group featuring Tottenham (pot one) and Everton (pot three) - but one of them could face Celtic (pot two).

Also for understandable political reasons, I believe Ukrainian and Russian sides will also be kept apart. UEFA's Giorgio Marchetti I'm sure will inform us a few moments before the draw.

Outside draws anyone? Maybe they could take it on tour like the 'Bureau de Change' on The Day Today... nope, just me then.

Who says the Europa League is boring?

Having a look at the teams in the draw for the group stage today gives me hope we could have some cracking ties before Christmas this year.

For instance, Celtic could line up against Tottenham or Everton this term while there are some big sharks swimming around in Inter Milan and the holders Sevilla.

I'm looking forward to this draw...
