David Guilfoyle, whose body lay undiscovered in a shallow grave for seven years after being beaten to death by love rival Shane Fitzpatrick in a 'moment of madness'

A missing businessman whose body lay undiscovered in a shallow grave for seven years was beaten to death by a love rival in a 'moment of madness', an inquest heard.

Property developer David Guilfoyle, 37, disappeared in May 2005 whilst having affairs with two women.

Guillotine operator Shane Fitzpatrick the ex-husband of one of the women was later jailed for life for murdering Guilfoyle then hiding his body.

But despite extensive searches of 
waters and woodland across east Lancashire including a search of a 
reservoir by police divers, Guilfoyle's corpse was never found.

Then last year Fitzpatrick, now 43, 
contacted police from Garth Prison near Leyland to reveal how he killed 
Guilfoyle and was taken from his cell to pinpoint where he buried his 
victim's body in woodland at Bolton-by-Bowland.

He later told an officer he had 
'found God' and was now willing to show them where he dumped the body of
his former love rival. He told an officer: 'I want to admit I killed 
David.

'It was a moment of madness I regret 
for his family, my family and my own position. I just went over the top.
He didn't deserve it but he does deserve a proper religious funeral.'

He also said he was willing to meet 
Guilfoyle's family and personally explain 'how and why he killed David',
as he wanted to help them and himself to 'come to terms with what he 
had done'. Guilfoyle's body was discovered following a two day search.

At an inquest in Blackburn, 
Lancashire, Guilfoyle's daughter Samantha, 23, wept as a coroner paid 
tribute to both her and police for never giving up hope of finding of 
her father's body.

The victim was said to have a 
£1million fortune and owned a number of properties which were rented 
out. He also travelled the world, including Egypt, Brazil and Australia 
and was a championship pool player who represented England in the sport.

But Guilfoyle was also described as a black market 'wheeler dealer' selling illegally-imported cigarettes, pirate DVDs and counterfeit clothing. Friends said he often kept up to £30,000 in his home and had lots of enemies.

Fitzpatrick had married teaching assistant Debbie Fitzpatrick  in 1995 and the couple had three children but their marriage was stormy.

The factory worker was said to have a 'possessive jealousy' towards Ms Fitzpatrick, believed she was having an affair with a work colleague and beat her leaving her with various injuries including black eyes and fractured cheekbone.

Ms Fitzpatrick eventually moved out of their home in Hapton, near Burnley, Lancashire, and in November 2002, began an affair with Guilfoyle who was already dating another woman.

Fitzpatrick sent his former wife text 
messages saying he did not like Guilfoyle. In conversations he told her:
'You're mine - he has stolen you off me and I feel like killing him.'

The Fitzpatricks were divorced in August, 2004, but he still harboured feelings for his former wife.
Guilfoyle was last seen alive on May 25, 2005, watching Liverpool's 
victory in the Champion's League Final at the Grey Horse pub in 
Accrington.

He was said to 
be 'in jubilant mood' but he was reported missing two days later. Police
who went to the victim's £230,000 bungalow in Accrington, found huge 
bloodstains on the drive.

Guilfoyle's racing green convertible Jaguar XK8 car worth £15,000 was found parked and locked on the drive. Mail was found behind the door, a computer still switched on showing the date May 25 and his bed had not been slept in.

Clothing was lying around, his wallet, credit cards and PINS were on a bedside cabinet and a substantial amount of cash was in the house. His parked car was locked but the keys could not be located.

Guilfoyle's blood was found around the house with a large heavy bloodstain on the drive. Attempts had been made to clean up the scene probably from the hose pipe.

Fitzpatrick kept his story, and the location of the body, secret throughout his trial, but told a probation officer last year that he wanted to confess to express his 'deep remorse'

It emerged Fitzpatrick had chosen the area to dispose of the body because he was a fell runner who knew it well as he had competed in Bowland Harriers fell races

Fitzpatrick's DNA was found on a torch discovered on top of the hose pipe and neighbours recalled spotting him in the days leading up to Guilfoyle's disappearance dressed in dark clothing and behaving 'like a commando.'

Police charged him with murder but he was overheard telephoning his son saying defiantly: 'The worst case is I will get 15 to 20 years if found guilty - but I still reckon I've got a good chance of getting off with it.'

He was jailed in 2005 for 20 years.

The inquest heard Fitzpatrick kept his story, and the location of the body, secret throughout his trial, but told a probation officer last year that he wanted to confess to express his 'deep remorse' and apologise to Guilfoyle's family.

He said he had became 'obsessed' about confronting Guilfoyle over his fling with Debbie armed himself with a wooden pick axe handle and lay in wait for the victim to come home.

He admitted hitting Mr Guilfoyle up to 15 times across the head, before he wrapped the body in some blue sheeting and drove to some woodland in Bolton-by-Bowland, where he dug a shallow grave with his hands.

It emerged Fitzpatrick had chosen the area to dispose of the body because he was a fell runner who knew the area as he had competed in Bowland Harriers fell races.

Recording a verdict of unlawful killing upon Guilfoyle, Blackburn Coroner Michael Singleton said it was 'intolerable' Samantha had been forced to wait seven years for answers.

He added: 'I know that for many years it was a matter of considerable concern to police that your father's body hadn't been recovered and I know they never never gave up the belief that they would one day recover his body.'
