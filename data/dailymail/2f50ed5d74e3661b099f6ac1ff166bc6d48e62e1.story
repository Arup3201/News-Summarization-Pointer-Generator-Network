Pensioners are ditching dentures in favour of dental implants, at a cost of up to £30,000.

Dentists say more and more retirees are raiding their pensions to pay for the implants, which are not normally funded by the NHS, in search of a dazzling 'Hollywood smile' such as that displayed by A-listers.

Simon Cowell and Cameron Diaz are among those celebrities who are rumoured to have had the treatment.

Clinics can charge as much as £3,000 for one implant, £15,000 for a whole row of teeth and £30,000 for a complete set.

A dental implant is a titanium screw
 that can replace the root of a tooth when it fails. Just like a tooth 
root, it is placed into the jawbone and can be used to support one or 
more false teeth.

The body recognises the titanium as part of itself
 and grows onto it, giving a bionic, living connection.  A tooth face is
 placed on top of the screw for a perfect smile.

The procedure is 
tried and tested, and any number of teeth can be replaced, from a single
 tooth to a complete set, depending on the condition of the bone in the 
jaw.

Most implants are fitted by private dentists because they will not be funded by the NHS unless there is a real medical need.

Dr Zybutz, who fits up to 2,500 implants a year, told The Times: ‘It means a lot to people. The baby boomers with savings expect a lot more out of their lives — they don’t think their lives are over just because they are 60 or 70.

Dentures are described by one dentist as 'walking somewhere when you can take the car'

‘Having dentures is like walking 
somewhere when you could take the car. More people in the UK are having 
implants now, dentures are yesterday’s solution.'

Clinics such as Dr Zybutz’s in London charge £3,000 for one implant, while a whole row of teeth on either jaw will cost £15,000 and a whole set will cost £30,000. Other practices offer the procedure from £995 per implant.

Ben Atkins, a trustee of the British Dental Health Foundation, said: ‘The middle classes are getting implants but it doesn’t have to be ‘either or’, you can have one or two implants and attach a denture to it and it’s perfectly secure.’

The trend for implants follows previous fads for veneers, which also create the appearance of pearly white teeth.
