An aspiring actor who was arrested after posing as a Twilight star and seducing a 14-year-old girl over Facebook has now been accused of inappropriately touching a second teenage girl.

David LaVera, 33, of San Diego, 
California, allegedly pretended to be Kiowa Gordon, 24, who played minor character Embry in three Twilight films, to lure girls to a park.

The news of LaVera targeting another teenage girl raised questions as to why he was not arrested when the first girl went to the police in Newton, Iowa last week.

LaVera was arrested on Tuesday after he allegedly inappropriately touched a different girl and drove off with her. The girl was returned to her family unharmed.

He had chatted with the girl over Facebook before driving 26 hours from California to Iowa to meet her.

Mother Tammy Adams said that prior to this incident, LaVera also tried the same moves on her teenage daughter Raven on June 3.

Ms Adams told USA Today that LaVera told her daughter he was the Twilight star and convinced her and a friend to go to a park with him, where he touched her inappropriately.

The 33-year-old allegedly asked the teenager if they could meet up at night to make out. The girl planned to stay at a friend's and sneak out to meet him but her mother found out and called the police in Newton.

Raven Adams, who attends Berg Middle School, told USA Today: 'They didn't do anything about it. If they had, I don't think this would have happened to this other girl.'

After Tammy Adams contacted the police, an officer found LaVera at a bar and gave him a verbal warning but did not arrest him. He was allegedly signing autographs and taking pictures with his 'fans' at the time. 

Newton Lt. Bill Henninger told MailOnline today that he could not comment on Ms Adams' claims.

He described LaVera as 'a wolf dressed in sheep's clothing who children would gravitate to'.

Lt. Henninger said that he believed LaVera had been staying in town with a family for around a month. Concerned citizens had called the police department to report seeing LaVera in town with other children, both male and female.

He said that he believed that LaVera had been introducing himself both by his real name but had convinced others, in particular groups of teenagers, that he was Kiowa Gordon and signing autographs in his name.

Raven Adams met the actor at her school on May 28 where he was brought by a parents of a student.

He was introduced to students as David LaVera, a stuntman from California, before he signed autographs and performed stunts at assembly.

On May 29, Raven Adams posted a pictured with the actor on her Facebook page. In the comments below, when asked who he was, she wrote: 'A guy that plays in twilight... he played embry call.'

One commenter wrote: 'And have you looked at a picture of embry from the movie... just looks diff.'

The teen replied: 'He is older it was like 5 and six years ago and he is a stunt double he filled in for the kne who broke his legs he was young tho.'

She added: 'He came to the school he is a family friend of a students his parents met him somewhere and they became really good friends.'

The school is now reviewing its visitor policy.

It is unclear, after being introduced as LaVera, how the man managed to convince the teenage girls that he was Kiowa Gordon.

LaVera was arrested on Tuesday after he convinced a 14-year-old girl to get into his car.  The victim's sister called their mother to tell them the teen had left with LaVera. The mother, April Roush, called police.

LaVera and the teen were spotted on the outskirts of town by one of Ms Roush's friends, who stood in front of his car and demanded the girl come with her.

After she was safely out of LaVera's vehicle, he sped away. Sheriff's deputies caught up with him a short time later. In his car, they found two swords and four daggers.

LaVera has been charged with enticing a minor, carrying weapons and failure to have a valid driver's license.

He is being held in Jasper County Jail in Newton on a $50,000 bond and is due to appear in court on Monday.

Baxter Police Chief Steve Wright told WHO-TV that he fears to think what LaVera's intentions were for the girl.

'This isn’t somebody that just wants to be friends. And typically this is the kind of person that meets a profile of somebody that can be a predator and can be dangerous,' he said.

Ms Roush credited her friend who rescued her daughter with saving the girl's life.

'I don't think I would have ever seen my daughter again. And if so, it would have been to bury her,' she told WHO. 

Ms Roush says she her daughter was so convinced that LaVera was the Twilight star that she still believes Kiowa Gordon was the one who came to pick her up.

According to the Internet Movie Database, LaVera has appeared in 13 movies, including  Die Fighting, Fortune 500 Man and a non-speaking role in Indiana Jones and the Crystal Skull.
