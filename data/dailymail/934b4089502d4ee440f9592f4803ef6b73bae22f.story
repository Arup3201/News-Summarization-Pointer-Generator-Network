From their unusual ‘rippling’ legs to fiendish fangs, spiders strike terror into many people.

But arachnophobes may now have another reason to reach for a glass to trap their nemeses because baby spiders - or spiderlings -  have been caught on camera ‘exploding’ from the back of their mother.

The bizarre defence mechanism was filmed by Mathew Duncan, of Chula Vista, California, when he captured two three adult spiders in a jar.

The bizarre 'defence mechanism' was filmed when Mathew Duncan, of Chula Vista, California, when he captured two adult spiders in a jar. Here, you can make out the female beneath the aggressor spider (bottom), while her babies scuttle away after 'jumping' from her back

One spider is shown to scuttle aggressively towards the female before flipping her over and grabbing hold of her.

As the fight begins, the female appears to eject her babies from her back, showering them across the jar.

While it may be tempting to think that she has summoned a miniature army to defend her, one expert thinks that the aggressor may have simply torn the sac, which females carry developing spiderlings in on their backs.

Another theory is that the mother was giving her brood the best chance of survival when she was under threat, by releasing them out into the world. 

But it appears it is the spiderlings that have made the 'decision,' not her.

Dr Judith Lock, an expert in behavioural ecology at the University of Southampton, told MailOnline that it looks as if the spiderlings jumped off their mother's backs when she was under threat.

Stuart Hine, Centre Manager, Identification & Advisory Service at the Natural History Museum in London, told MailOnline: 'What we have is one spider species attacking another, which is always likely if they are put in an enclosed space like this.

'I cannot make out what the attacking species is, other than it is a male – as can be determined by its swollen palps. 

'The smaller and ‘attacked’ spider is probably a species of Pardosa (Araneae: Lycosidae) and she is carrying her brood on her ‘back’. 

'This is typical behaviour of the family Lycosidae, the females carry their egg cocoons around with them and when they hatch,  the young spiderlings crawl onto her abdomen where they are afforded protection and maternal care – including a share of her food.

'It all goes wrong though if she is attacked by a predator herself, in which case they simply disperse as in this video – they are probably old enough to fend for themselves providing they were released.

'In the animal world most mothers will stoically attempt to protect their offspring from attack. However in most species their own survival instinct ultimately overrules the maternal instinct and their own survival becomes paramount.'

One spider is shown to scuttle aggressively towards the female before seemingly grabbing hold of her (pictured bottom). It is not clear whether the larger spider tears the female's egg sac, whether she deliberately unleashes the tiny spiders in defence, or if, as one expert suggests, the spiderlings escape voluntarily

Some spiders are better mothers than others. Female wolf spiders carry their spiderlings on their backs (pictured) when they have hatched and are among very few species of spiders to do this

An army of green-fanged cannibal spiders is invading Britain - eating smaller arachnids as they set up nests in homes across the country.

The eight-legged creatures are believed to be tube spiders - one of the largest types in the UK - and their bite is like a bee sting.

Their thick black bodies range from between 1.5cm to 2.2cm wide, their fangs shine menacingly green, and they are known to eat their own mothers.

Mike Rance first spotted the eight-legged beast when he was outside his friend's house in Newport, South Wales.

Mr Rance, 41 from Cwmbran, said: 'I spotted this one on the wall and shined a light on to it and could see its fangs.

'It was devouring another smaller spider – they're proper little cannibals.

'We tried to feed it a woodlouse but it wasn't interested. 

'They only seemed to want to eat smaller ones, I guess they must be easier prey.'

A vet confirmed that one of the spiders, which had been captured, was a tube spider.

A few species of spiders allow their offspring to ride on their backs while they are small. This gives them a better chance of not being eaten.

'The agressor spider flips the mother over. Perhaps the spiderlings recognise a chance in orientation and that's when the jump off,' Dr Lock said.

Craig Walker, arachnid expert at ZSL London Zoo agrees. 

'As the footage is so blurry it does give the impression that she explodes, but of course she is just carrying her brood on her abdomen as do many species of “nomadic” spiders, such as wolf spiders for instance.

'When she is attacked they simply jump off & run for cover.

'Other inverts that carry their young on their backs include scorpions.'

An invertebrate keeper at Bristol Zoo Gardens added: 'The babies scattering is their best chance of survival- not likely to be causing a distraction or an attack. Maternal care methods vary greatly in the world of spiders.' 

Mr Duncan said he had ‘no idea’ that when he trapped the spiders, one of them was carrying babies on her back.

‘So I'm glad I caught it and fed it to the other before I had 20-30 spiders disperse in my home. I would love to know what type of spiders these two are,’ he told The Mirror.

If the spider was using a defense mechanism in a bid to ward off her attacker, her ‘explosion’ of babies is not the only strange defence mechanism unleashed in the natural world.

The hairy frog - also known as the horror frog - breaks its own tow bones when under threat so they stick out through its skin and act as claws. 

Likewise, the Iberian ribbed newt pushes its own rib bones through its skin, before secreting poison through the holes created.

Insects such as the Malaysian ant have poisonous glands which explode when they are threatened, shooting the deadly liquid towards aggressors.

The potato beetle eats poisonous plants to cover itself in toxic faeces, while Cereal leaf beetles encase their poo in a jelly sac, which they carry on their back as protection.

Many creatures have usual defence mechanisms including the cereal leaf beetle (pictured) which encases its poisonous poo in a jelly sac, which it then carries on its back as protection against being eaten
