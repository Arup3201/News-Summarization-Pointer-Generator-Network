It is no mystery that men are given a boost by the effects a push-up bra has on the cleavage.

But what is more surprising is the effect a boosted cleavage can have on the woman herself.

For the first time, scientists have measured the effect an enhanced cleavage has on confidence - and found there is a direct link.

The unique study, led by scientists at Manchester University proves for the first time the clear connection between a cleavage-enhancing bra and increased confidence - prompting the study lead, Professor Geoff Beattie, to call for a stop to 'unnecessary boob jobs'

Boost: Scientists at Manchester University found that women wearing the 
push-up bra demonstrated confidence levels 75 per cent higher than normal

A total of 60 video recordings were made of female participants aged 20 to 55, filmed in three different everyday interactions.

Footage was compared of them wearing a push-up bra and wearing their own normal, everyday bra.

Professor Beattie and his team analysed the three key micro-behaviours associated with confidence and observed their frequency within the recordings.

Smiling - which represents positive emotion and signals confidence increased dramatically by 73 per cent when the women were wearing a push up bra.

Averting gaze and breaking eye contact - normally associated with low confidence - decreased by 41 per cent.

And self-comforting hand movements such as stroking of the chin or wiping the forehand, which is a signpost to low self confidence, decreased by 64 per cent during the trial.

Professor of Psychology at The University of Manchester Geoff Beattie called the results 'striking'.

The scientists found women with an enhanced cleavage were more likely to maintain eye contact and showed fewer 
physical signs of low confidence

'The differences are much more pronounced than expected,' he said.

'The study showed emphatically that wearing the cleavage-enhancing bra had a significant effect on nonverbal behaviours that are crucially associated with levels of self-confidence.

'And we know that confidence impacts on performance, both at work and in our personal lives.

'Society places a huge amount of pressure to look a certain way and this impacts on women’s perceptions of their own body image, ultimately affecting their confidence.

'For this study, I wasn’t interested in what women reported about how they felt wearing the different bras – this study was about the actual behaviours they displayed, subconscious indicators that can be much more revealing.

'My hope is that this research might deter women from seeking more drastic solutions to improve their confidence, such as breast augmentation, because it proves for the first time that what women wear can positively affect their behaviour.'

This is the first academic study to demonstrate a clear link between confidence and cleavage.

The research was independently commissioned by Gossard for its launch of the Super Egoboost push-up bra, which has been two years in development and was used in the trial.

Gossard Head Designer Stacey Lindsay who is responsible for the design of the Super Egoboost bra explains: 'We hope this research will prevent more women from having unnecessary plastic surgery to enhance their breasts, especially in light of the recent PIP implant scares.

'It just shows that you don’t have to go under the knife to achieve confidence-boosting killer cleavage.'

'Gossard has been making lingerie for 110 years and we recognise that stunning cleavage in a well designed, well-made bra can boost confidence and give our customers the feelgood factor - but it’s amazing to actually have the scientific seal of approval.'
