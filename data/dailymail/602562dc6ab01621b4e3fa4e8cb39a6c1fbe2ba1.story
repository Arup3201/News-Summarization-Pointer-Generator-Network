Manchester United are hopeful that Robin van Persie’s ankle injury will only keep him out for one game, which is good news for Louis van Gaal but not for Radamel Falcao.

Van Persie limped out of United’s defeat at home to Southampton on Sunday and was forced to cancel plans to travel to Zurich for the Ballon d’Or awards ceremony where he had been nominated for Goal of the Year.

However, tests have revealed no serious damage and Van Persie is only expected to be ruled out of this weekend’s game at QPR.

The 31-year-old should be available for the trip to Cambridge United in the FA Cup a week on Friday, although he was rested for United’s game at Yeovil in the last round when Van Gaal gave James Wilson an opportunity to impress.

The news on Van Persie is less positive for Falcao who is desperate for a run in the team to persuade United to make his loan move from Monaco permanent in the summer.

The Colombia star was surprisingly axed from the 18-man squad for the Southampton match by Van Gaal, casting further doubt over United’s intentions to go ahead with a £52million deal.

Falcao is expected to regain his place against QPR in Van Persie’s absence on Saturday, but his return to the starting line-up may be shortlived.

His agent Jorge Mendes admitted earlier this week that he was unsure if the former FC Porto and Atletico Madrid striker would stay at Old Trafford beyond this season after starting only eight games so far.

‘I don’t know (if he will stay),’ said Mendes. ‘He is a fantastic player and I think it’s very difficult for Manchester United fans. They have an absolutely brilliant player, one of the very best in the world, who would without any doubt play 90 minutes, every time, with any other club.

‘The truth is, now, we don’t know what will happen. What we do know is that he will play for one of the very best clubs in the world next season, whether that is Manchester United or not. I am 100 per cent sure of that. But you know how football works, we’ll see what happens.’

One striker certain to be leaving United is Angelo Henriquez after the club agreed a transfer fee in the region of £1m with Dinamo Zagreb.

Henriquez cost £4m when he moved to Old Trafford in the summer of 2012 from Universidad de Chile but never played a competitive game for United, scoring once in a pre-season friendly against Swedish club AIK a year later.

He went out on loan to Wigan and Real Zaragoza before making a season-long move to Zagreb where he has scored 10 goals so far this season.

The deal included an option for the Croatian side to sign Henriquez permanently in the summer, and coach Zoran Mamic confirmed that terms have now been agreed.

With so many star names in Van Gaal’s squad, Henriquez had already indicated that his future would probably lie away from Old Trafford.

‘We have bought him outright,’ said Mamic. ‘Taking Henriquez depends on us, not on Manchester United. We took him with the right of first refusal, which stands at around €1.5m, and we have already signed a contract with him for the summer. There is no longer any doubt – he is ours and the story is resolved.’

Meanwhile, FC Midtjylland of Denmark have failed with a bid for United’s Danish keeper Anders Lindegaard.

Lindegaard is for sale after Victor Valdes signed, but the clubs cannot agree a fee and the keeper would prefer to join a bigger team.
