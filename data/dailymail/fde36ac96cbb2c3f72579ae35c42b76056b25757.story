The man who inspired the best-selling book Moneyball believes Arsenal are the best-run football club in the Premier League.

Billy Beane, the general manager of baseball side Oakland A's, used statistics to assemble a team of players he considered to be under-valued. 

And he insists Arsenal are primed for success despite the club being criticised for their safety-first approach when it comes to spending big.

'When I first came into baseball people didn’t want to hear that a team was a business,' Beane told the Guardian. 'But it is. And the better the business is run, the healthier the team on the field is going to be. That is why I admire Arsenal. 

'If I’m buying stock in a football team that’s the one I buy. They’ve got revenues. They’re successful. They pay down their debt. 

'And ultimately in today’s world that’s the best way for a long-term success.'

Beane also revealed that he has become fixated with football in England.

'If I don’t get to watch a match live, I tape it,' he added. 'Even if I know the score I go back and watch. I find it fascinating.

'I love the sport. I love the business. I love the fact there’s such a dichotomy between, say, the Emirates and Turf Moor. It’s an education for me.'

Liverpool attempted to implement the Moneyball principles under owner John W Henry but enjoyed limited success.

And Beane believes the sacking culture in the Premier League has to change.

He said: 'Two weeks ago I was listening to 606 and I heard some Liverpool fans questioning Brendan Rodgers – a man who nearly won the Premier League title this year – and I was thinking: "Really?" But that’s the challenge and noise you face.

'What also makes it difficult is that every year between a third and 50 per cent of league managers leave. As the old saying goes, no plan interrupted is ever successful.'
