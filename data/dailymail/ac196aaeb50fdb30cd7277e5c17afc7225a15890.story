A coroner in Ohio has found that the 
father of a boy killed in a 2012 school shooting died of an accidental 
heroin overdose on the second anniversary of his son's death.

The
 Geauga County coroner confirmed Friday that 48-year-old Russell King 
Sr. succumbed to the combined effects of heroin and alcohol.

A family 
member found King dead at his home in Aquilla Village just after 5am on the morning of February 27.

Russell King Sr., 48, was found dead at his home on the second anniversary of the Chardon High School shooting in Ohio in which his son Russell Jr., 17, was killed

At his sentencing last March, Lane wore a T-shirt with 'killer' scrawled across it and cursed and gestured obscenely at relatives of victims in the courtroom

King's
 17-year-old son, Russell King Jr., was one of three students killed in 
the February 2012 shooting at Chardon High School east of Cleveland. 
Three other students were wounded in the shooting inside the school's 
cafeteria.

Gunman T.J. Lane, 19, pleaded guilty to the shooting rampage and is serving three life sentences.

‘Whatever transpired, there's no question Russell King is another victim of this tragic shooting two years ago today,’ Craig Bashein, an attorney who represents the family in a wrongful death lawsuit, said after the father's death. 

Lane opened fire in the school's cafeteria with a .22-Ruger before classes began. He also killed Daniel Parmertor, 16, and Demetrius Hewlin, 16. Russell was 17.

Three other students were wounded, including Nick Walczak, Nate Mueller and Joy Rickers.

'What happened took an enormous toll on all the families,' said Geauga County Prosecutor James Flaiz, who worked with the youths' families for several months during Lane's criminal case.

'It hit Mr. King as hard or harder than the others. He was extremely close to his son. Seeing the emotional pain on him concerned me.'

Attorneys for families of the victims, including King Sr., and some of those who were wounded have filed a personal injury lawsuit against the Chardon School District, some of its administrators and the alternative school that the shooter attended.

Rude: Lane had flipped the middle finger and used profane language toward those in the packed courtroom, including the victims' families

Prosecutors say T.J. Lane, who was waiting for a bus to the alternative school, took a .22-caliber pistol and a knife to the high school and fired 10 shots at a group of students inside the cafeteria on February 27, 2012.

At his sentencing last March, he wore a T-shirt with ‘killer’ scrawled across it and cursed and gestured obscenely at relatives of victims in the courtroom.

Investigators said he admitted to the shooting but said he didn't know why he did it.

Russell King Sr. went to all of the court hearings involving Lane. He is survived by his wife, Jeannie, and their older daughter, Crystal.

A year ago, families of the three slain students filed a wrongful-death lawsuit against the teenage gunman and his family. The suit alleged negligent supervision by Lane's parents and grandparents.
