It's been described as a 'suicidal mission' that is doomed to fail.

Despite this, the Mars One project - which aims to send people to live on the red planet - has whittled down its shortlist of candidates from more than 200,000 to just 100.

From this, a final crew of four will eventually be selected for a 'one-way ticket' to the red planet scheduled to arrive in 2025 following a grueling seven-month journey from Earth.

It's been described as a 'suicidal mission'. Despite this, the Mars One project - which aims to send people to live on the red planet - has whittled down its shortlist of candidates from more than 200,000 to just 100. Pictured is an artist's impression of what a colony on Mars could look like

'The large cut in candidates is an important step towards finding out who has the right stuff to go to Mars,' said Bas Lansdorp, co-founder of the Dutch Mars One mission.

'These aspiring Martians provide the world with a glimpse into who the modern day explorers will be.'

The Mars 100 Round Three candidates were selected from a pool of 660 candidates after participating in personal online interviews.

They include 50 men and 50 women who successfully passed the second round. 

The majority of the 100 applicants  come from the US, 31 come from Europe, 16 from Asia, seven from Africa and seven from Australia. The full list can be viewed here.

Hannah Earnshaw, 23, a PhD student in astronomy at Durham University, is among the hopefuls.

The Mars One project plans to launch a supply mission to land on Mars as soon as October 2016.

A 'settlement rover' will then land in 2018.

The landing systems will be tested eight times before they are used to transport humans - a move that Mars One said will make the trips 'much safer than moon missions'.

The group said it aims to have a human settlement on Mars within a decade.

Journey time to Mars, which is approximately 40 million miles away depending on its position in orbit, would be around 200 days.

She said: 'Human space exploration has always interested me so the opportunity to be one of the people involved was really appealing. The future of humanity is in space.

'My family is pretty thrilled. They're really happy for me. Obviously it's going to be challenging, leaving Earth and not coming back. I've had support from my friends and family and we can still communicate via the internet.' 

Additional teams would join the settlement every two years, with the intention that by 2033 there would be over twenty people living and working on Mars. 

There, they will collect data, plant oxygen-producing vegetation and set the foundation for human colonisation. 

In spite of the risks, more than 200,000 people from around the world applied when the Netherlands-based group called for volunteers to join the mission.

In the next stage, which may involve 'rigorous, potentially televised competitions', the current shortlist will be reduced to 40. 

The time frame for this next stage depends on how long it takes the team to sort through the 100 on the list.

Candidates that were not selected will have a chance to re-apply in a new application round that will open in 2015. 

Chris Hadfield, former commander of the ISS, recently told Elmo Keep, writing in Medium that the mission may not deliver on this promise.

'There's a great, I don't know, self-defeating optimism in the way that this project has been set up,' Hadfield told Medium.

'I fear that it's going to be a little disillusioning for people, because it's presented as if for sure it's going to happen.'

Endemol, the production company behind Big Brother, said earlier last year it will be documenting the progress of the group of hopefuls as they compete for a 2025 ticket to the red planet.

Candidates do not need to have any scientific qualifications and an audience vote will be used to make the final choice.

Any chosen Mars settlers will then be required to dedicate eight years of their lives preparing for the 300 million-mile (482 million km) pioneering mission.

Igore Mitrofanov of the Space Research Institute at the Russian Academy of Sciences told the Voice of Russia that the largest risk is the huge amounts of radiation the volunteers will receive.

Echoing Mr Hadfield's concerns, he said he doubts that the volunteers for this trip know enough science and technology to take the risk.

The group had promised on its site that in 1,000 years, everyone on Earth will remember who the first humans on Mars were.

A robotic lander and orbiter are scheduled to lift off in 2018, followed by a scouting rover in 2020 and six cargo missions in 2022. 

The next round will include an interview with Mars One committee members, and candidates advancing to the third round will compete against one another.

The third round will include a series of challenges to prepare candidates for the potential mission and could broadcast on television and online.

But Mr Hadfield claims Mars should not be a target for colonisation at this point, but targets much closer need to be considered.
