This is the heart-stopping moment a truck travelling the wrong way along a motorway crashes headlong into a Ford Mustang, bursting into two of flame and killing both drivers.

Jeremy Smeltzer, 29, was spotted careering along the left-hand side of U.S. 131, near Plainwell, Michigan, in a lorry just before midnight on April 15.

Michigan troopers set off in pursuit, desperately trying to overtake and stop him before there was a serious accident. But they were too late.

Debris: Debris flies into the windscreen of one of the troopers' cars as Smeltzer's lorry careers into Jaryd Ford's Mustang

Fireballs: Both vehicles burst instantly into balls of flame, lighting up the highway as more officers rushed to the scene

Just as one of the officers pulled into the hard shoulder to perform a U-turn into Smeltzer's lane, 21-year-old Jaryd Ford's Mustang speeds past, smashing straight into the truck.

The camera in the trooperâ€™s car captures the collision as debris scatters onto the highway.

'He hit a car, he just hit a car,' the trooper says as he witnesses the crash.

Sole survivor: As flames light up the highway, more officers rushed to the scene and managed to drag Megan Covey, 26, from the passenger seat of Ford's car before it was consumed by fire

Tragic: Ford, however, was pronounced dead at the scene while Smeltzer died later in hospital

Too late: Moments earlier, one of the officers pulled into the hard shoulder to perform a U-turn into Smeltzer's lane in a bid to stop him. But it was too late

Mystery: It is unclear why Smeltzer was driving on the wrong side of the road as police await toxicology reports to see if either driver had been drinking

Both vehicles burst instantly into balls of flame, lighting up the highway as more officers rushed to the scene.

Incredibly, the quick-thinking troopers managed to drag Megan Covey, 26, from the passenger seat of Ford's car before it was consumed by fire. She was last night being treated in hospital for non-life-threatening injuries.

Ford, however, was pronounced dead at the scene while Smeltzer died later in hospital.

It is unclear why Smeltzer was driving on the wrong side of the road as police await toxicology reports.

Married Smeltzer's family paid tribute to him on a website, describing him as a 'pure joy to be around'.

'Jeremy enjoyed making people laugh, time with his dogs (Ender & Newton), hockey, fishing, and time with his wife and family,' they wrote. 'He loved reading, writing, singing too loud and making up stories. He was a pure joy to be around.'
