Two fathers who were made famous when an Instagram image of them doing their daughters' hair in the morning went viral are hitting back at the negative and homophobic reactions to their lifestyle in a new ad campaign for Nikon. 

Kordale Lewis and his fiance Kaleb, from Atlanta, Georgia, star alongside their three adorable children in the video, offering further insight into their 'normal' day-to-day life - and insisting that nobody outside of their family should pass judgement on how they choose to live. 

'We just want people to know that, hey, we're normal, and you can't judge people on their normal, you really can't,' one of the fathers says at the start of the clip.

Where it all began: The fathers first hit the headlines back in January last year when they posted this picture of their morning routine on Instagram

The adoptive fathers, whose children Desmiray, 8, Malia, 7, and Kordale Jr., 6, admit that they were stunned at the response to their original Instagram image, particularly as they felt it captured nothing out of the ordinary for them. 

'It was a simple, innocent picture and then the next thing you know, it went viral,' the couple explain. 

'The comments were a trip. It didn’t make me feel any way, because I know they don’t know what we go through, I know they don’t know our children, I know they don’t know our lifestyle, they don’t know how we live.'

When they uploaded the now-infamous picture to their Instagram account, the couple simply wanted to share with others the dedication and devotion that they show towards their children as parents. 

At the time, they captioned the image: 'Being fathers is getting our daughters up at 5.30am making breakfast getting them dressed for school and putting them on the bus by 6.30.

Older sister: Desmiray, 8, is the eldest of Kaleb and Kordale's three children

Middle child: Malia, 7, often features in her father's Instagram pictures 

Baby of the bunch: Kordale Jr., 6, is the youngest of the three children and Kordale and Kaleb's only son

'This is a typical day in our household. It's not easy but we enjoy every moment and every minute of fatherhood.'

At the time, the couple admitted that they were hurt by the fact that some people suggested they were unable to raise their children properly, because of their sexuality, their gender or their race. 

While Kordale and Kaleb were quick to delete any and all negative comments posted on their account, they admitted that the bitter words of some critics had a profound and lasting effect on them.  

'We may be gay but this does not mean we are incapable of what a heterosexual couple is capable of!' they wrote in a post for HuffPost Gay Voices.

'Our main objective as parents is to provide, love, educate, support, encourage, and love some more.'  

In the video, they reiterate the fact that their roles as fathers to their three children come before anything else in their lives. 

'We as parents bring kids into the world and we have to guide them to be better people than we are,' they explain. 

Everyday routine: The fathers haven't allowed the negative online criticism to stop them from living their lives, and enjoying every minute that they get to spend with their children

Doting dad: Both parents insist they are 100 per cent dedicated to their roles as fathers to the three children

True love: The couple continue to share snippets from their life on their Instagram account

'And we want them to be better people than we are. And we want them to succeed and do things that we weren't able to do. 

'And those kids have our hearts and I can't sit here and explain to you in words why we feel the way that we feel for our children. But those are our kids and nobody else can tell me anything different.' 

Despite the negative reactions of some people, Kordale and Kaleb have also received an overwhelming amount of support from a number of people, who have been quick to praise the pair for setting such a brilliant example of what fatherhood is. 

'I absolutely support you both 100 per cent!' one Instagram user wrote. 

'Don't listen to the haters and don't let them discourage you guys! You're wonderful parents! Remember that and look toward the future! My father was a dead beat. I never remember him even touching my hair. 

'I wish I had a father like you guys! The bond you both are creating with your daughters will live on in their memories & hearts forever! I salute you both!'
