Australian sport will show it is on its way back at the Commonwealth Games after a disastrous showing at London 2012, Olympic 100m hurdles champion Sally Pearson has warned.

Australia could only finish a lowly 10th - seven places below Great Britain-  in the medals table at the last Olympics as Pearson won one of the mere seven golds her country took back home.

The green and gold of Australia has, however, topped every medals table at the Commonwealths since 1986, when Scotland last hosted the Games. 

Star: Sally Pearson won gold in the 100m hurdles at the 2012 London Olympics for Australia

Comeback: Pearson insists that Australian sport is on the up and they can top the medal table in Glasgow

The last time England topped the Commonwealth Games medals table was 1986.

Australia have led the way since, so is this the time for England to get back on top?

2010 Commonwealth Games in Delhi

1st: Australia - 74 gold, 55 silver, 48 bronze (total 177) 

3rd: England - 37 gold, 59 silver, 46 bronze (total 142) 

2006 Commonwealth Games in Melbourne

1st: Australia - 84 gold, 69 silver, 69 bronze (total 222)

2nd: England - 36 gold, 40 silver, 34 bronze (total 110)

2002 Commonwealth Games in Manchester

1st: Australia - 82 gold, 62 silver, 63 bronze (total 207)

2nd: England - 54 gold, 51 silver, 60 bronze (total 165)

R.E. Don't forget that at the 2012 Olympics, Australia won just seven golds... the same number as Yorkshire! 

Steve Moneghetti, Australia’s chef de mission, has admitted his country will ‘have our work cut out just to win the medal tally, let alone dominate it’ but Pearson, the athletics team captain, believes we will see the signs of her country’s new generation of talent in Glasgow.

Pearson said: ‘Don’t tell me (about London 2012)! It was the best time of my life but it was terrible (for Australia).

'But we have a good team this year: 103 in athletics, a lot of young and younger athletes coming through. It’s going to be a good Games, and we always have the swimmers - our saving grace.

‘A lot of our top athletes (in track and field) retired after the Sydney Olympics so it was like a whole new generation to build up through to Beijing in 2008 and on to London.

Lone champion: Pearson's gold was one of just seven for Australia but she thinks Glasgow will be different

‘It has been a huge building (process), 14 years, to try to find new athletes and to develop them. But finally now we have a good crop of juniors coming through, especially because the Commonwealth Games in 2018 are on the Gold Coast.’

Other Olympic champions have opted to skip the competition, or run only in relays, but Pearson, 27, has continually prioritised Glasgow, despite a year hampered by a hamstring injury and now family worries.

Pearson’s mother, Anne, is from Kent and the Australian has been staying with her aunt and uncle in the county since June 2.

She had been looking forward to the family travelling up to Glasgow to support her but found out on Friday that her aunt was ill in intensive care.

Challenge: England's Tiffany Porter will do battle with Pearson in the 100m hurdles in Glasgow

She said: ‘We are a very close family so it’s very hard at the moment. There are a lot of things going through my head. It’s like, “Give me a break. Let’s get a gold medal at the Commonwealth Games”.’

Pearson, who faces England’s Tiffany Porter over the 100m hurdles on Horse Guards Parade in the Sainsbury’s Anniversary Games on Sunday, may yet double up in the 100m and hurdles in Glasgow.

She did that four years ago in Delhi and crossed the line first in both before being disqualified from the flat sprint for a false start. The complaining nation, of course, just had to be England.

‘I got over that pretty quickly,’ said Pearson. ‘But I’m desperate to run it again.’

Emotional: Pearson's aunt is currently in intensive care and she is determined to win for her
