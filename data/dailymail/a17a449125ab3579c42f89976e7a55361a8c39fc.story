Two mechanics have spent two years and more than £50,000 transforming a classic car into a Ghostbusters replica. 

Classic car fanatic Paul Harborne, 52, from Dudley, West Midlands, was desperate to find a rare 1960 Cadillac Miller-Meteor which he could use for the project.

When he did, the father-of-five and his business partner Tim Jordan dedicated two whole years to creating the ultimate Ecto-1 car replica.

Paul Harborne, 52, and his business partner Tim Jordan spent two years converting this rare classic car into a Ghostbusters replica 

They covered the car in white emulsion, painted on the famous Ghostbusters logo and even fitted mock ghost-capturing equipment onto the vehicle.

The result - which cost £50,000 to achieve - is this traffic-stopping machine, which  is now being displayed at the Dudley Classic Car Show, in the West Midlands. 

Mr Harborne, who is also a huge film lover, said: 'I wanted to combine my love of films and classic cars and I've always wanted to own a cool classic car from a film.

'But the Batmobile had already been done so I went back to the drawing board. I have a soft spot for Ghostbusters and also the car was big enough to be used as a limo, which was a plus.' 

Mr Harborne bought this 1960 Cadillac Miller-Meteor two years ago, with the aim of turning it into an Ecto-1

The sought-after car, which seats six people, was originally used as an ambulance in the U.S. Only 2,000 were produced during a four-year period

Only 2,000 were produced during a four-year period in the late 1950s and early 1960s, meaning they are hard to come by.

But after trawling car dealerships and the internet, Mr Harborne finally managed to find one, just a few miles away in Leicester.

The pair painstakingly worked on the car every day, fixing and tinkering with it until they felt it was perfect

The biggest struggle Mr Harborne and Mr Jordan faced was finding the specialist parts for the car.

He said it was 'exhausting' to work on the car every day but it was worth it for the reaction they get whenever they drive it

As the models were hand-built, factory parts are not easy to track down. The pair ended up building most of the bodywork themselves.

Paul said: 'We worked on the car every day, which was exhausting, but it was such an exciting project.

'But it is so worth it, and the reaction we get when we take it out is incredible.'

The car can now be hired out for parties, proms and weddings through Ghostsbusters Car For Hire.
