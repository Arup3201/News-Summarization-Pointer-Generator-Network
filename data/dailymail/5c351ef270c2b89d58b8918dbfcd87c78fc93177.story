An image of the genius who took physics to new heights is eerily manifested on the side of an Austrian mountain in this incredible image.

The face, which appears on the side of Grimming Mountain in Steiermark, has an uncanny resemblance to Albert Einstein, the German-born physicist famous for developing the general theory of relativity and forever changing our understanding of the universe.

Anyone viewing the mountain might expect to see nothing more than snowy slopes. However, a closer look shows what is actually there - an incredibly accurate profile of Einstein's famous face.

Relative-ly similar: Grimming Mountain, in Steiermark, Austria, bears a striking resemblance to genius Albert Einstein

Ironically, Einstein, who is also famous for the Theory of Brownian Motion, Unified Field Theory and his work on the Manhattan project which led to America developing the atom bomb, was a citizen of Austria from 1911-1912.

In 1921 he won the Nobel Prize for physics and was so famous that in the period before World War II he would be stopped on the street by people wanting him to explain the theory of relativity.

His ingenious way of handling it was to apologise and explain that he just happened to look like the great man. He died in Princeton, New Jersey in 1955 at the age of 76.

Soaring intellect: Here we see the uncannily similar peak set against an azure sky

The mountain is similar to Mount Rushmore National Memorial, a sculpture carved into the granite face of Mount Rushmore near Keystone, South Dakota, in the United States.

Sculpted by Danish-American Gutzon Borglum and his son, Lincoln Borglum, Mount Rushmore features 60-foot sculptures of the heads of former United States presidents George Washington, Thomas Jefferson, Theodore Roosevelt and Abraham Lincoln.
