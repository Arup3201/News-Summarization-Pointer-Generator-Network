Heavy drinking was the cause of ten million visits to English hospitals last year, figures have revealed.

In the first all-encompassing analysis of the toll of alcohol on the health service, experts put the total cost of treatment at £2.8billion.

Charities last night said that the country’s booze culture is putting an ‘intolerable strain’ on the NHS.

Previous attempts to quantify the impact of alcohol on hospitals have focused only on inpatient visits requiring an overnight stay, with most estimates at one million alcohol-related admissions a year. But the latest research – with outpatient admissions and A&E trips also taken into account – puts the true impact of drinking at ten times higher.

The analysis also calculates the long-term impact of heavy drinking, such as heart disease, stroke and cancer.

The charity Alcohol Concern, which examined official figures provided by the NHS, found that alcohol caused 9.96million visits to English hospitals in 2012/13. That included 6.3million visits to A&E, 992,000 overnight admissions to inpatient wards, and 2.67million day visits to outpatient wards.

Hospital staff report that A&E units are turning into war zones, particularly at weekends. Health Minister Norman Lamb has called for a £50 fine for those who ‘gratuitously’ consume too much alcohol and then abuse health staff when they are taken to hospital.

Mr Lamb said in August: ‘There’s an issue with youngsters drinking too much. It’s having a massive impact on people’s health and the consequences for them further down the line are enormous.’

But Alcohol Concern’s report shows that while A&E admissions are a huge source of problems, long-term drinking is also placing a burden on the NHS because it causes diseases which are expensive to treat. Its research reveals that 47 per cent of all admissions for head and neck cancer – including tumours of the mouth and throat – are linked to drinking. Just over 13 per cent cases of breast cancer are also attributed to alcohol.

Toll: More than 6million of the visits were to A&E units and a million included overnight stays in hospital

Some 15 per cent of gastrointestinal cancers, 13.5 per cent of hypertensive disease such as heart disease and stroke, and 23.4 per cent of epilepsy admissions are rooted in heavy drinking.

According to the charity’s Alcohol Harm Map, men aged 55 to 75 were the most likely to be admitted to hospital due to alcohol misuse. And some 9.6million people are now drinking in excess of Government guidelines, including 2.4million who are classed as high risk. Those rated high-risk drink more than eight units of alcohol a day – about three pints of beer or four large glasses of wine.

While A&E admissions accounted for the vast majority of visits, inpatient admissions cost far more, making up two-thirds of the total cost burden of £2.8billion.

Alcohol Concern chief executive Jackie Ballard said: ‘The NHS is now facing an intolerable strain from alcohol-related illnesses.

‘This is not just from readily identifiable causes such as A&E visits and admissions for liver disease, but from a significant number of other conditions in which alcohol plays a major, but often under-appreciated part.

‘We urgently need action to prevent alcohol misuse. The most effective of which is for the Government to implement a minimum unit price, which has the potential to save the economy millions, and most importantly save lives.’

Government agency Public Health England said alcohol harm was going in the wrong direction as it repeated calls for minimum pricing to be introduced.

Rosanna O’Connor, director of the alcohol, drugs and tobacco division at PHE, said: ‘Alcohol harms are unacceptably high and much of this is preventable.

‘PHE will continue to promote the evidence for a minimum unit price on alcohol and other measures to reduce harm, raise awareness of the harms to those drinking at risk, as well as promoting good effective local treatment and specialist hospital services for all who need them.’
