A woman who survived a crash in which her husband, mother and two foster sons drowned in a reservoir relived in court the moment her 'life was ruined'.

Denise Griffith, 56, told a jury at Caernarfon crown court in North Wales that there was a shunt as she moved across a road into a lay-by before her car plunged into the water.

'The next thing I knew we were going anticlockwise. I saw the rocks and sky and rocks again. I remember the water in my face,' she recalled.

Denise Griffith, right,  has told a court of the moment she escaped from a crash in which her husband, mother and two foster sons drowned in a reservoir. Gordon Dyche, left,  denies causing the deaths by dangerous or careless driving

'I couldn’t undo my seatbelt at first. I sat in the seat thinking "how long have I to live?"

'I was taking water in, I couldn’t undo my seatbelt. I thought "I can’t just stay like this". I just touched my seatbelt and it came undone.

'The Lord did come and help me to get out of the car. I came out of the car through the window and came to the surface.'

A dog, Milly, also got out of the vehicle. Mrs Griffith said: 'I never felt so relieved to see Milly. I just knew the others hadn’t got out.'

Grim search: Police officers at the scene where Mrs Griffith's people carrier plunged into Llyn Clywedog reservoir near Llanidloes on April 20 last year

Tragic: Rescue workers work to recover the bodies from the car. Mrs Griffith has earlier managed to swim to safety

She had been on a 'leisurely drive' when the tragedy occurred during a caravan holiday in mid Wales.

Gordon Dyche, 24, of Llanbrynmair, mid
Wales, denies causing the deaths by dangerous or careless 
driving of Emyr Griffith, 66, Phyllis Hooper, 84, and Peter Briscome and
Liam Govier, both 14 and who had autism.

The family from Pontypridd died when their people carrier plunged into Llyn Clywedog near Llanidloes on April 20 last year.

Mrs Griffith said that, as she swam to the side of the lake, a man said : 'I’m really sorry. I was rushing for work’.

Opening the case, prosecuting barrister Simon Mills alleged this was Dyche.

Mr Mills said Mrs Griffith’s driving had been described by a witness as 'exemplary'.

Support: Mrs Griffith arrives at Caernarfon Crown Court with her two brothers and other family members for the start of the trial

'Lonely place to be': Mrs Griffith returns to the scene of the crash, which happened when a driver hit her from behind while she was turning into a lay-by next to the reservoir

She had indicated to turn right into a lay-by at the side of the reservoir to allow her mother to take photographs.

'The
defendant was driving in the same direction as Mrs Griffith, but two 
cars behind her. He had become impatient, travelling behind two slower 
vehicles and tried to overtake both of them.

Drowned: Mrs Griffith's husband, 
Emyr Griffith, foster sons, Peter Briscome and Liam Govier, and mother Phyllis Hooper (pictured), all died in the crash

'Because he did that, he struck Mrs Griffith as she was carrying out her right-hand turn.

'He was responsible for what happened because he took what we say was a dangerous gamble.

'He explained at the scene he had been rushing because he was late for work. He admitted at the scene it was his fault.'

But Mr Mills said when formally 
interviewed by police later that day that 'he tried to explain away the 
admissions he made at the scene as having resulted from panic and 
shock.'

Mr Mills continued: 'He said he left for work at the normal time. He felt the manoeuvre had been safe.'

Mrs Griffith’s seven-seater Peugeot 807 had been travelling at about 40mph after leaving Machynlleth.

The
driver of a VW Passat behind her noticed Dyche’s silver Mondeo car 
approach from behind 'intent on getting past him, seeming to be in a 
hurry.'

The Peugeot was 
struck from behind and rolled a number of times down a bank into the 
water, sinking between 4.5metres and seven metres, but staying on its 
wheels.

Divers recovered the bodies of the passengers.

Cross-examined
by defence barrister Geraint Jones about whether she was sure she had 
indicated to turn, Mrs Griffith replied: 'Positive.'

Mr Jones said: 'When you got out of the water you asked the man behind if you had indicated and he said you had.'

Nighttime search: Police were forced to work into the night to recover the bodies

Police were forced to cordon off the stretch of fence through with Mrs Griffith crashed

'Dreadful situation': Skid marks are visible on the tarmac at the scene of the collision

Mrs Griffith replied: 'Yes. Can you imagine how I felt at that time? I think to myself "maybe I just killed my family". I wanted to make sure I had done everything possible and everything right.'

She added: 'I know my life has been ruined. It’s the most lonely, lonely place to be.'

Mr Jones said: 'I appreciate it was a dreadful situation.'

Judge Niclas Parry told the widow before she left the witness box: 'Everybody in this room their thoughts are with you.'

The trial continues.
