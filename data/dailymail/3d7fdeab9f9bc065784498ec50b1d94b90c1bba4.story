An Oklahoma City police officer accused of raping and sexually assaulting 13 women while on duty has been charged with six more sex crimes.

Daniel Ken Holtzclaw, 27,  was charged with the offences in Oklahoma County District Court on Tuesday, after three new victims came forward.

The victims, including a 17-year-old girl, said that Holtzclaw forced them to commit sex acts while he was on duty.

He is now facing a total of 32 charges  by 13 women which include rape, sexual battery, forcible oral sodomy, burglary, stalking, indecent exposure and procuring lewd exhibition.

A judge charged him with the new counts of first-degree rape, as well as one count each of second-degree rape by instrumentation, forcible oral sodomy and sexual battery. 

The three new women came forward after seeing Holtzclaw in the news, according to a probable cause affidavit obtained by The Oklahoman.

The officer's alleged 17-year-old female victim told police that she and some friends were walking near Park Place and Blackwelder Avenue on June 17 when he approached them.

He told her that there was a warrant for her arrest, but that he was letting her go, according to the affidavit.

He later stopped her again when she was alone and took her to her house. While on the front porch, he reportedly reached underneath her shirt and inside her shorts and underwear.

He then forced her to perform oral sex and have intercourse with him.

Another victim said she was walking late at night on May 22 when he stopped her to check for warrants. 

She didn’t have any, but he threatened her with jail if she didn’t have sex with him, according to the affidavit. 

He took her to NE 13 and Miramar where he forced her to perform oral sex and have intercourse before letting her out of the car, the affidavit states.

The final victim reported that Holtzclaw pulled her over on April 25 while driving near NE 16 and Kate Avenue. 

He told her she was going to detox, but instead took her to NE 25 and Miramar where he forced her to have sex with him and let her go, according to an affidavit.

His attorney, Scott Adams, says Holtzclaw denies all of the charges and is looking forward to his day in court so that he can get back to work at the police department.

Holtzclaw is under house arrest in Enid on $609,000 bond. A preliminary hearing is scheduled for November 18.
