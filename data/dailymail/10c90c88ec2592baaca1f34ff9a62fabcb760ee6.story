Two of the Tory party’s most outspoken women MPs are locked in a row over the media’s portrayal of Prince Harry.

In a scathing article, Nadine Dorries hit out at Louise Mensch over her support for The Sun’s decision to publish naked pictures of Harry taken at a party in Las Vegas.

She also poured scorn on her colleague for her recent announcement that she was quitting Parliament to spend more time with her family.

Miss Dorries accused Miss Mensch of being ‘void of principle’ and said she had ‘always put her own ambitions first’.

In an article for the 
ConservativeHome website, Miss Dorries wrote: ‘I would ask the former 
MP, next time she wants to open her mouth about a boy who lost his 
mother at the hands of the media in a way which shocked the world, she 
might want to look to her own heart and wonder how she would feel?

‘After all, it’s not as though Prince
Harry has admitted taking illegal drugs, abandoned his post, or failed 
to turn up to work every Thursday in the style of Louise Mensch, now is 
it?’

Miss Dorries, however, may not have recalled that in 2002, when he was 17, Harry admitted smoking cannabis at Highgrove.

Mrs Mensch declined to comment on the
attack, but issued a brief sarcastic comment about the affair on 
Twitter, saying: ‘Waking up to find myself on the Nadine Dorries naughty
step, which is a pity as I spend my entire time worrying about what she
thinks (ahem).’

Mrs Mensch, a successful chick-lit 
author under her maiden name Louise Bagshawe, stunned Westminster this 
month by announcing she was quitting Parliament so she and her three 
children could move to New York to be with her husband Peter.

Miss Dorries has a track record of 
making her point by using personal comments.

She infuriated Tory high 
command earlier this year by describing David Cameron and George Osborne
as ‘two posh boys who don’t know the price of milk’.

'Free press': Louise Mensch has been accused of 'schmoozing' Rupert Murdoch (pictured) after she defended his newspaper's decision to publish the pictures

Making a stand: Rupert Murdoch tweeted that the pictures were published to demonstrate that there is 'no such thing as free press' in the UK
