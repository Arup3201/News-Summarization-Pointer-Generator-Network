He may not be able to bring people back from the dead, but one scientist can make corpses look fresher thanks to s secret chemical bathing process.

Dr Alejandro Hernández Cárdenas has developed an unusual method to transform gnarled human remains into plumper and more life-like bodies.

The process is so useful as it can reveal features such as fingerprints, scars and tattoos, which can be used to identify individuals and solve crimes.

Dr Alejandro Hernández Cárdenas (pictured) has developed an unusual method to transform gnarled human remains into plumper and more life-like bodies. He plunges whole bodies - as well as body parts (pictured in the boxes) into a large tank filled with a secret mixture of chemicals

Only Dr Alejandro Hernández Cárdenas knows the ingredients of this secret soak which is used to refresh corpses.

After a few days to a week, shrivelled and partially-mummified remains are 'pumped up' and look like fresher corpses.

Features such as scars, tattoos and moles are revealed that can identify individuals and can potentially be used to solve crimes.

Bathing a hand can also revive it enough so that fingerprints can be taken.

While other methods are also used to obtain fingerprints from shrivelled hands, Dr Cárdenas' is thought to be the only one that can freshen up whole bodies.

They are bathed in a tank containing 60gallons (273litres) of his secret mixture.

Dr Cárdenas told Motherboard that he divides him time between dentistry, teaching forensic courses at Universidad Autónoma de Ciudad Juárez and identifying human remains at the Juarez Forensic Science Lab in Chihuahua, Mexico – a region renowned for its violence and high murder rate.

Since 2008 he has been plunging bodies – some shrivelled and scorched and some disfigured from accidents – into a tank that he refers to as the ‘jacuzzi’.

It holds approximately 60 gallons (273 litres) of a secret chemical formula which magically turns back time and plumps up bodies left to soak for around five days.

The method has so far revealed scars, moles, tattoos and wounds as well as fingerprints that have been used to identify missing people. Heads shrivelled in the desert heat regain plump lips and bruises that hint at a person’s final moments.

Bodies go through seven stages of decomposition and Dr Cárdenas’ technique reverses two of these stages – putrefaction when the proteins in the body break down so that tissue rots and decomposition, when water in the body dries up – leaving shrivelled remains.

Dr Cárdenas added that his patent-pending secret soak can reveal a corpse’s identity and sometimes the cause of death.

He has done hundreds of body part rehydrations and around a dozen full body soaks. When a body is taken out of the bath it feels plump and limbs and joints such as fingers are pliable – but it smells.

While he bathes the bodies, he talks to the corpses and condoles them, according to a report in The New York Times.

He sometimes plays them romantic music while they float, or turns on rap and hip-hop for victims whose faces look ‘menacing’.

Glycerin injections have long been used to reconstitute fingers from which to get fingerprints, but the method cannot be used for whole bodies.

It is of particular use in the dusty region, where bodies decompose and mummify rapidly in the fierce heat of the city and its surrounding desert landscape.

Dr Cárdenas does what many people might consider a grim job to give grieving families the chance to bury loved ones dumped in sprawling mass graves in the city of Ciudad Juarez (mapped) which contains unidentified bodies

Dr Cárdenas said that his patent-pending secret soak can reveal a corpse's identity and sometimes the cause of death. Fingertips can be 'plumped up' so that prints can be taken from them (pictured) - even if the remains were formerly partially mummified. Other methods exist to extract prints in this way, but Dr Cárdenas is thought to be the only one that can 'revive' whole bodies

Forensic researchers from the University of Southern Mississippi secured a patent for a rehydration technique to obtain fingerprints from dehydrated fingers. Their ‘PCOME’ method uses sodium hydroxide to plump up a finger, but timing is critical as too much of the chemical could dissolve it completely.

It is unknown whether the same chemical is used in Dr Cárdenas' process, but experts think he is the only person attempting the feat on such a large scale.

Dr Elizabeth Gardner, a forensic researcher at University of Alabama, Birmingham has witnessed a full-body rehydration and said: ‘It was quite amazing. It looked like a relatively fresh body.’

Dr Cárdenas does what many people might consider a grim job to give grieving families the chance to bury loved ones dumped in sprawling mass graves in the area which contains unidentified bodies. He even funds the rehydration technique himself.
