The U.S. government has accidentally named the top spy in Afghanistan on a memo given to reporters accompanying President Barack Obama on a surprise visit to Kabul.

The memorandum included an individual named as ‘Chief of Station’ - the title given to the top CIA officer in a given country. It was immediately retracted, and a new memo was issued.

The security breach was first reported late yesterday evening by the Washington Post, which declined to name the officer publicly for fear of putting him or his family at risk.

U.S. Ambassador to Afghanistan James B. Cunningham and 14 others were also named on the memo, including several senior military officials, according to the Post.

They were all identified as having being included in a meeting with President Obama at Bagram Air Force Base, just outside Afghanistan's capital city Kabul.

Reporters joining the president on the trip received the message via email, and it was then passed along to other news organizations as part of the ‘pool report,’ according to the paper.

A pool report is a summary of events collected by primary reporters and then passed to other news organizations not in attendance for use at their discretion.

More than 6,000 recipients received the pool report assembled by the Post’s White House bureau chief, the paper admitted.

This is only the second time in recent memory a CIA officer’s cover was blown by the very government he or she is working to protect.

Valerie Plame was infamously exposed by officials from President George W. Bush’s administration as they worked to discredit her ambassador husband while he railed against the government over the second Iraq war.

It is not clear if the top spy in Afghanistan will be forced to return to the U.S. similar to how multiple CIA agents in Pakistan fled the country after their names were exposed.

The station chief oversees hundreds of officers in Afghanistan.

On his surprise visit to Afghanistan yesterday, President Barack Obama pledged to bring America’s longest war to a 'responsible end' by the close of the year.

He told troops at this sprawling military base that the war had reached a pivotal point, with Afghan forces assuming primary responsibility for their country’s security.

While many of the 32,800 U.S. forces now in Afghanistan will leave in the coming months, Obama said a continued military presence could help protect gains made during nearly 13 years of fighting.

Obama's visit, his fourth to Afghanistan as president, came at a time of transition for a country long mired in conflict.

Most of the U.S. and international forces in Afghanistan are withdrawing ahead of year-end deadline.

Elections are also underway to replace Hamid Karzai - the only president Afghanistan has known since the U.S.-led invasion in 2001.
