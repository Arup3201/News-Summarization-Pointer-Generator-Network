A 22-year-old man dragged a safe full of prescription drugs behind his car for two miles after robbing a pharmacy in an early-morning break-in, police have said.

But Ryan Mullins, from Swansboro, North Carolina, was arrested on Tuesday after he pulled out in front of a police officer during his slow getaway.

Footage from the officer's cruiser dash cam shows the vehicle pulling along the 100-pound safe behind it, only attached by a piece of rope.

Arrested: Ryan Mullins, pictured left in his mug shot and right on Facebook, allegedly broke into a pharmacy and then dragged a safe full of prescription drugs behind his car for two miles before he was stopped

Just hours before, Mullins allegedly smashed a window at the drive-through of Family Care Pharmacy on Main Street in Swansboro and went into the building with a bag over his head.

Security footage shows he then put a towel over his face in a bid to hide his identity before he pulled out the safe and attached it to the back of his car with the rope around 5.30am, WCTI reported.

Witness Carmen Fickling said she saw the suspect's car and open trunk outside the pharmacy around 7.10am on Tuesday.

'You could just tell he was messing with something and having a struggle,' she told WCTI.

'A lot of things crossed through my mind as to what could possibly be going on and none of them were good. But I never expected to see him pull a safe with the rope. It was strange.'

Targetted: Mullins had allegedly broken in to this pharmacy to steal the safe. Surveillance footage from inside the store shows he put a towel over his head to avoid being recognized

At about 
7.30am, a police officer pulled out in front of his car on a nearby road
 and saw something swinging behind Mullins' car. He waited for him to 
overtake him, and spotted the safe.

The incident was captured on the officer's dashcam in his cruiser.

Mullins was initially arrested on a DWI until police officers learned that a similar safe had been stolen from a nearby pharmacy.

He appeared before a judge on Wednesday on multiple charges, including breaking and entering, theft, possession of stolen goods, trafficking of opium or heroin and DWI.
