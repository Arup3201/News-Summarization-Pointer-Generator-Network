Vice President Joe Biden's son Beau has left a Houston hospital after undergoing a complicated brain biopsy procedure and is returning to his home state of Delaware with his father.

The vice president's office said 44-year-old Beau, who is the attorney general of Delaware, would fly aboard Air Force Two along with his father.

Beau Biden underwent the medical procedure at the University of Texas MD Anderson Cancer Center on Tuesday.

The procedure came more than two weeks after emergency dispatchers were called to the vice president's Delaware home, where his son was staying, in response to a report of a possible stroke.

Three years ago, Beau Biden suffered a minor stroke.

Happy farewell: Beau Biden posted this picture of him standing with his wife, stepmother Jill and father Joe as he was about to leave the Houston hospital

In a statement released by the White House, the vice president and his wife Jill said their son underwent 'a successful procedure,' but they did not provide any details.

'He is in great shape and is going to be discharged tomorrow and heading home to Delaware,' they said in the statement Wednesday.

'He will follow up with his local physicians in the coming weeks.'

The White House declined to answer any questions about what procedure was performed, including whether it was diagnostic or therapeutic in nature.

They did, however, announce yesterday that Joe 
Biden has canceled scheduled appearances in Rhode Island and Maine today to remain in Houston with his son and other family members.

Pattern: Beau Biden, son of the Vice President, has undergone a procedure at a Texas cancer center after taking ill last week. It has now been revealed that 911 was called to his house weeks prior

Beau Biden, 44, had been suffering from weakness and disorientation while vacationing in Indiana last week.

A 911-call was made, and a county dispatch center log indicates 
that someone at the vice president's home was reported to be possibly 
having a stroke and apparently not alert.

Biden then arrived on Monday in Houston for tests at the University of Texas MD Anderson Cancer Center.

Emergency responders were also called earlier this month to the home where he had been staying, two weeks before he was hospitalized during a family vacation, authorities said on Wednesday.

Biden had been staying at his father's Greenville home while his own house is renovated.

The younger Biden has a history of neurological problems and suffered a mild stroke in 2010.

What's wrong? The Vice President's son had a stroke in 2010. The White House released a statement from Joe and Jill Biden Wednesday announcing Beau had undergone an unnamed procedure

Rickie Clark, a staff supervisor with the Cranston Heights Fire Co., confirmed on Wednesday that county dispatchers received a call for help from Joe Biden's home. However, he refused to provide further details.

The dispatch log on the fire department's website shows two references to the vice president's home on Aug. 1, one at 9:25 p.m. and another about a minute and a half later.

Both cite ‘Cva-Not Alert,’ indicating that a person was in distress and apparently not alert or responsive to his or her surroundings. Clark said ‘Cva’ is shorthand for cerebrovascular accident, or stroke.

Biden was initially admitted to Northwestern Memorial Hospital in Chicago last week and traveled the next day to the Philadelphia hospital where he had been treated for his 2010 stroke to consult with his doctor. He spent last weekend at home in Wilmington before going to Texas.

All clear: The Biden's motorcade was seen leaving the Houston hospital Thursday morning

Julie Penne, a spokeswoman for the University of Texas MD Anderson Cancer Center in Houston, said Wednesday that she did not have any information on Biden.

The younger Biden has posted two photos of himself in recent days - one of him smiling with his father on Sunday, the other of him smiling with his wife, Hallie, on Tuesday.

‘Touched by all your well wishes--thank you. Nice evening in Houston w/ Hallie; will share update when we have it,’ said the tweet accompanying the photo with his wife.

Joe Biden is still scheduled to join President Barack Obama in Biden's hometown of Scranton, Pennsylvania, on Friday during the second day of an Obama bus tour to discuss college costs.
