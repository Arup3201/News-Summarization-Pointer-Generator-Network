A Pennsylvania doctor accused of poisoning his wife had more than $30,000 stashed in a safe when he was arrested, it emerged this week.

University of Pittsburgh medical researcher Robert Ferrante, 65, faces one count of homicide in the April death of his wife, Autumn Klein, and a search warrant application unsealed Monday has provided new details about the fascinating case.

The Allegheny County district attorney's office sought in September to obtain three items - a black iPhone, a set of keys and a Florida driver's license - seized by police when Ferrante was stopped on Interstate 77 near Beckley in July.

The keys opened a safety deposit box that contained $30,000, the Pittsburgh Post-Gazette reported.

Klein, cheif of women's neurology at University of Pittsburgh medical center, collapsed in the couple's Oakland home on April 17 and died in UPMC Presbyterian three days later.

Detective
 Lyle Graber said that the driver's license, obtained by Ferrante, could
 provide investigators with information 'necessary to indicate 
Ferrante's intention of permanently changing his residency from 
Pennsylvania to Florida prior to his arrest.'

Investigators
 previously said that Ferrante obtained two safety deposit boxes in the 
weeks after his wife's death. The one containing the $30,000 listed his 
adult daughter from another marriage as an owner.

Included
 with the warrant application unsealed Monday was a nine-page report 
from the West Virginia State Police that listed additional items they 
found when they stopped Ferrante, including cash, a silver trinket with a
 clover leaf, several debit or credit cards and Klein's dental insurance
 card.

In July, before a gag order was placed on the case, Ferrante insisted he will prove he didn't poison his neurologist wife with cyanide.

Blood tests revealed a lethal level 
of cyanide, but only after Klein had died and been cremated at her 
husband's insistence, police said.

Following a court hearing in West Virginia in July, Ferrante's lawyer, William Difenderfer, said his client intends to prove his innocence.

Speaking to ABC News, Mr Difenderfer, said: 'He's anxious to defend himself, have
 his day in court and prove his 
innocence, which I'm quite confident we'll be able to do.'

Tragic: Autumn Klein was the chief of women's neurology at the University of Pittsburgh Medical Center and died on April 20 after suddenly falling ill

Authorities allege that Ferrante, co-director of the Center for ALS Research and a visiting 
professor of neurological surgery at the University of Pittsburgh used a university credit card to buy more than a half-pound of cyanide two days before his wife became ill.

A witness claims Ferrante asked for help buying 'the best and purest cyanide he could get.'

They
 say he added it to an energy supplement that he gave to her hours after
 they exchanged text messages about how the supplement could help them 
conceive a child.

While
 the criminal complaint in the case indicates that Klein may have been 
trying to get pregnant, authorities allege that Ferrante also suspected 
that she was having an affair.

Detectives say they've found evidence
 Ferrante confronted his wife about the suspected affair three times in 
the weeks leading to her death.

Klein is believed to have told a male friend in February that she planned to leave her husband.

Mr Difenderfer previously said his 
client wasn't trying to flee charges when he 
left Florida and began driving north before his arrest last week.

He said he had called his client and 
told him to return to Pittsburgh to surrender, and his client was 'on 
his way to turn himself in.'

Ferrante is a leading researcher on Lou 
Gehrig's disease, also known as amyotrophic lateral sclerosis, which 
attacks nerve cells in the brain and spinal cord that control the 
muscles, eventually leading to death.

The couple met while she was a student and he worked at the VA hospital in Bedford, Massachusetts. They were married in 2001.
