Police have found the bullies suspected of filling a bucket with faeces, urine, spittle and cigarette butts then pouring it over an  autistic teenager in a depraved twist on the Ice Bucket Challenge.

The 15-year-old boy was filmed standing under a garage in his underwear before the bucket of brown slurry was tipped on his head from off-screen.

The clip, filmed in Bay Village, near Cleveland, Ohio, caused an outcry when it emerged, sparking appeals to track down those responsible.

Unaware: This 15-year-old autistic boy from Ohio agreed to take the ALS ice bucket challenge, not knowing that the teens who asked him to do it were playing a sick prank on him 

Humiliating: Standing in his underwear outside a garage, the teen was doused with a mixture of urine, faeces, saliva and cigarette butts

And now police in the area say they have identified almost everyone responsible and are poised to hand over a dossier of evidence to local prosecutors.

Mark Spaetzel, a police chief in Bay Village, confirmed that his officers had tracked down the culprits in a statement to Cleveland.com.

He added: 'We are being very thorough in gathering all the necessary facts before presenting to the Cuyahoga County Prosecutor's Office.'

Cyber-bullying: The teen's tormentors used his cell phone to record the prank and upload it onto Instagram 

The clip was filmed on the boy's own mobile phone and then posted to the Instagram social network.

According to the boy's mother, who gave her name only as Diane so as to protect her son's identity, the victim was so embarrassed by the cruel prank that he wanted to keep it a secret.

But when his family discovered the clip, they decided to share it more widely to raise awareness of how he had been bullied.

Diane told the Fox8 news station that the bullies had perverted the charitable aims of the Ice Bucket Challenge - which is meant to raise cash and awareness for ALS, a muscle-wasting disease.

She said: 'The bucket challenge is supposed to be raising awareness for this disease and now they’ve turned it into a sick joke. I just can’t understand why kids would do something this cruel.’

The hunt for the culprits also caught the attention of several American celebrities.

Actress and model Jenny McCarthy offered $10,000 as a reward for information leading to the bullies' prosecution, as did gameshow host Drew Carey.

However, Bay Village politely declined the offer, pointing out that a reward was not necessary as the culprits have already been found.
