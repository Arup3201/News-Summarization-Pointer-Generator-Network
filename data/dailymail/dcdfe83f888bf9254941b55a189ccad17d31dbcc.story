Crystal Palace are looking to finalise the loan of Yaya Sanogo from Arsenal on Monday evening.

Arsene Wenger has turned down requests from Bordeaux while Hull City and QPR have also asked about the 21-year-old.

Sanogo was understood to be at Palace’s training ground on Monday morning ahead of medical tests before finalising his loan until the end of the season.

Wenger wants Sanogo to gain Premier League experience and believes Palace manager Alan Pardew can help him mature as he guides the Selhurst Park club away from the relegation zone.

Crystal Palace ended a Premier League run of eight league games without a win as they defeated Tottenham 2-1 at Selhurst Park. 

Palace are currently 15th in the Premier League table.
