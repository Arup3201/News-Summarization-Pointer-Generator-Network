Victim: Sabrina Moss died after she was shot while out celebrating her birthday. Four men were arrested today

Four men have been arrested in connection with the murder of a nursery school teacher who was mown down with a machine gun while out celebrating her 24th birthday.

Mother Sabrina Moss was killed clutching a kebab in Kilburn High road, north London, in the early hours of August 24, after being shot in the chest.

Her friend Sabrina Gachette, 24, was 
wounded in the incident - along with two other men.

Today armed officers and detectives investigating the murder held four men following early morning raids on five addresses in north west London.

A 28-year-old man was arrested in Cricklewood, a 19-year-old man and a 28-year-old man were arrested in Kilburn and a 19-year-old man was arrested in Wembley.

All four have been taken into custody at a north London police station to be questioned.

Searches are being carried out at the addresses where the men were arrested and two further addresses in Cricklewood and Kilburn.

Police are also searching an alleyway in Kilburn.

It is believed that Sabrina may have been the victim of a bungled hit on somebody else.

Staff at Woody Grill, where Sabrina bought her food, rushed to stem the flow of blood with napkins but she could not be saved.

The owner of the takeaway said: ‘I heard bangs but 
wasn’t sure what they were until the girls ran into the shop. Sabrina was screaming, “I’ve been shot, I’ve been shot".'

Remembered: A taxi drives past a memorial to Miss Moss, 24, who was shot in Kilburn, north-west London

Teacher: Miss Moss was allegedly caught in a hail of bullets from a shotgun and machine gun when killed

The arrests come just five days after Sabrina's funeral which was attended by hundreds of mourners.

Martell Warren, 22, from north west London has already been charged with Sabrina's murder and the attempted murder of Sabrina Gachette and will appear at the Old Bailey on November 19.

He is also charged with the attempted murder of two other men who were arrested when they went to hospital suffering from gunshot wounds.
