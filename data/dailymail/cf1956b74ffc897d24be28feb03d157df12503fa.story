Former president George W. Bush's daughter Barbara Bush recently opened up about her new boyfriend, being an aunt and her support for a Hillary 2016 ticket.

Ms Bush is currently working as the CEO of Global Health Corps, a company she helped start with partner Dave Ryan.

She's been spending much of the last year traveling throughout Africa, but she's still made time to start a relationship with Miky Fabrega, who lives in Panama. 

Former first daughter: Barbara Bush recently spoke with People about her new boyfriend, niece Mila and her support for a Hillary Clinton bid for president in 2016

The painter and creative consultant was Ms Bush's date for her father's presidential library dedication in April - and says her father approves of the new boyfriend.

'My dad is obsessed with art right now,' Ms Bush told People, referring to Mr Bush's recent foray into painting. 'So anyone that likes art, he is excited about.'

Artiste: The former president has become quite the prolific artist in his retirement. His daughter says her cat has sat for two portraits

Getting serious: Despite constantly traveling for her job, and the fact that her boyfriend lives in another country, the two have been pictured together quite a lot

Pets are a favorite subject of the former president, and Ms Bush said that her cat had sat twice in her father's studio.

Though she has no political affiliation, the republican president's daughter admitted that she's rooting for Hillary Clinton to run for president in 2016.

She called the former first lady and secretary of state 'unbelievably accomplished' but didn't promise she would vote for her in a general election. 'I don't know who she'd be running against,' Ms Bush said.

In her charity work, Ms Bush works with both the Clinton Health Initiative and Michelle Obama's 'Let's Move' campaign.

Her organization beings young professionals to Africa for a year to use their expertise to help those living in third-world conditions.

But Ms Bush also has another job: being an aunt. Her twin sister Jenna recently gave birth to a baby girl named Margaret Laura 'Mila' Hager.

More Bush babies? Ms Bush said she's like to give niece Mila a cousin one day, but having children isn't what she's focused on right now

'I love having her to spoil,' she said. While she'd like to give Mila a cousin someday, she doesn't have any plans in the near future.

'It's just not what I'm focused on right now,' she said. 'I never felt like there had to be a parth that I followed.'
