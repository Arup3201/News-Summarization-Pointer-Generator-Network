Manchester United have agreed to sign young Fulham striker Kayne Diedrick-Roberts.

The 15-year-old was released by the Craven Cottage club because they already had three promising strikers for his age group but United believe he has potential to improve and have given him a contract.

The teenager, who can play as a winger, second striker or in midfield was part of Fulham's Premier League International Cup winning squad in November and impressed United recruitment staff.

Diedrick-Roberts, a pupil at Kingsdale School, London, will sign as a first year professional at United officially in July.

Meanwhile, Fulham have agreed terms with Newport County over 16-year-old Regan Poole. The centre-back had trials at Manchester United in November.

Fulham boss Kit Symons said: 'He’s a good young player Regan and someone who we’ve been watching closely. The deal is looking very positive.'
