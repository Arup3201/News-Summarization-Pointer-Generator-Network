Two police officers pleaded not guilty to assault charges on Wednesday in the violent beat-down of a teenage marijuana suspect who prosecutors say never put up a fight.

David Afanador and Tyraine Isaac sat expressionless as defense attorney Stephen Worth entered the plea for them at an appearance in state court in Brooklyn. Afterward, Worth said a widely watched security video of the encounter was misleading.

'It's only damning because it lacks the context which the officers and the other evidence in this case will provide,' Worth said.

He said the teen marijuana suspect was 'noncompliant' throughout the encounter.

Brooklyn District Attorney Ken Thompson, speaking to reporters at his office, took a different view. He called the video convincing evidence of police brutality.

'We had a 16-year-old boy with his hands up, seeking to surrender, who was attacked by members of the force who are supposed to protect him. ... He was defenseless,' Thompson said. 

'We've all seen the video. It speaks for itself.'

In the video, 16-year-old Kahreem Tribble is seen running away from the officers in the Brooklyn neighborhood of Bedford-Stuyvesant about 2am on Aug. 29. 

After a brief chase, Tribble stops running and turns around to face the NYPD cops in apparent surrender.

That's when one of the officers, later identified as Tyrane Isaac, approaches the teen and punches him in the head, according to DNAinfo New York.

A few seconds later, Officer David Afanador catches up to Tribble — as he raises his hands  — and whacks him in the teeth with the pistol, breaking a front tooth and chipping another, according to the news site.

Officer Isaac then later punches the teen again, the website reported.

Afanador, who leaves momentarily to find the black bag that Tribble allegedly threw out when he saw the cops, comes back a few minutes later. He waves the bag in the teen's face and smacks him with it.

The two cops began chasing Tribble near 1311 St. John's Place when they spotted the 16-year-old looking through the window of a parked vehicle, according to DNAinfo New York.

Police say Tribble tossed out a small black bag before taking off and officers feared he had a gun, the news website reported. 

Tribble was arrested with 17 small bags of marijuana, court records show. He was also charged with disorderly conduct. 

The NYPD's Internal Affairs Bureau began investigating the arrest and tracked down the video after the teen complained about a mouth injury. Medical records showed that he lost at least two teeth.

News of the excessive-force investigation surfaced last month amid an uproar over the death of an unarmed man, Eric Garner, during another videotaped arrest in July on Staten Island. The medical examiner ruled that a banned chokehold used by one of the arresting officers contributed to Garner's death.

A grand jury is hearing evidence to consider whether there should be criminal charges brought in the Garner case, with a decision expected before the end of the year. Union officials insist the officer used an authorized takedown move, not a chokehold.

Afanador, 33, faces up to seven years in prison if convicted of felony assault. Isaac, 36, faces up to a year if convicted of misdemeanor assault. Both have been suspended from the police force.

Police Commissioner William Bratton has said he's eager to identify abusive officers and kick them out of the nation's largest police department.
