A frail widow who was recovering from cancer was bound by her hands and feet before being beaten to death by burglars.

Pamela Wheeler, 76, was tortured into revealing the combination to a small safe in which she kept her life savings.

The pensioner was known to have kept a large amount of cash at home because she did not trust banks.

Investigation: Police search for clues in the street in Thamesmead, south-east London, where Pam Wheeler was found dead in her bungalow

The raiders are thought to have kicked
and punched the defenceless mother of two in the face and upper body as
she lay cowering on her dining room floor.

Detectives believe she was still alive when the raiders fled from her bungalow in Thamesmead, south London, last Thursday.

Mrs Wheeler’s body was found three days later after neighbours noticed she had not fed the local cats.

Police found her back door open and her safe open.

Several credit cards had been left strewn around the semi-detached property.

The attackers are thought to have forced her to reveal the PIN numbers to her bank cards.

Mrs Wheeler, who had recently recovered from breast cancer, lived alone following the death of her husband Dennis two years ago.

Yesterday her devastated family 
described the former dressmaker as a kind and charitable widow who had 
lost touch with her ten siblings following the breakdown of her first 
marriage.

Her niece, Velda Holland Jones, 74, said: ‘She was a lovely lady.

‘We used to hang out when we were in our twenties and she was a happy girl back then. It’s shocking to hear how she died.

‘After she split from her first 
husband, John, she became estranged from the family and there was no one
who was in touch with her any more.

‘No one knew why she lost touch with 
us all, but that’s  the kind of thing that happens when people move off 
in their own directions.’

The mother of two, who remarried in 
1997, wrote a post on Friends Reunited a number of years ago saying: ‘I 
am happily married to Dennis, and living in Thamesmead, south London. I 
have two children, both married, and three dogs whom I adore.’

But following her husband’s death at the age of 70, she became reclusive.

Police say Mrs Wheeler kept a large amount of money in a safe at her home because she didn't trust banks

Neighbour Tracey Smith, 39, said: ‘Pam
was really friendly with the children and you would always see her 
taking her dogs for a walk and she was happy.

‘But after her husband passed away she
would stand outside at night in her dressing gown on her own. The girl 
next door phoned the council and told them she needed help.

‘She did have a carer who came round occasionally and she was mobile but she obviously had a  few problems.

‘My friend went in and found her. She had her hands tied. Her credit cards were out on the floor.’

Neighbours said they had seen two men 
aged 19 or 20 hanging around by her gate on Thursday evening. A post 
mortem examination failed to establish a cause of death, and police are 
awaiting the results of further tests.

Last night detectives were studying CCTV footage of the area.

Detective Chief Inspector Graeme Gwyn,
who is leading the murder investigation said: ‘Friends knew her as a 
lovely lady who fed the cats and donated money to animal charities.

‘It was known that she used to keep 
money at the premises. It may have been that word got around to someone.
She had little trust in the banks.’

He added: ‘It’s a horrific way to die and a cowardly attack on a defenceless elderly lady in her own home.’
