Chelsea were hit with a worrying injury scare on Friday after striker Diego Costa sustained a hamstring problem while on international duty with Spain.

The striker, who has scored four goals in Chelsea’s three Barclays Premier League games, has withdrawn from Spain’s squad to face Macedonia with a hamstring injury.

Chelsea’s medical team, who will examine the striker on Saturday, will face an anxious wait for news ahead of next weekend’s clash against Swansea.

Injury concern: Diego Costa had no choice but to withdraw from Spain's upcoming fixture against Macedonia

Friendly defeat: Spain were beaten 1-0 by France at the Stade de France on Thursday night

A Spanish football federation statement read: ‘Diego Costa has a myofascial injury to his hamstring muscle in his left thigh. The injury was detected with an MRI scan after the player expressed some discomfort during Thursday’s match against France.

‘All the tests carried out by the medical staff will be sent to Chelsea.’

Costa was due to fly back to the UK on Friday and Chelsea will await results from their own tests before determining how long he will spend on the sidelines.

The 25-year-old sustained a hamstring injury in training ahead of last weekend’s win over Everton, but it is unclear whether the new strain is related.

Main man: Chelsea boss Jose Mourinho will be hoping Costa is available for his side's next game
