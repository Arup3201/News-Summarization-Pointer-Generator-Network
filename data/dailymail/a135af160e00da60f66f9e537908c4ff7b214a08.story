A single mother has cancelled Christmas for her 11-year-old son so she can scrape together the £20,000 needed to pay his private school fees.

Kelly Bradford, 41, said she would rather spend her money on son William's education than on presents and a turkey dinner this December. 

Instead William will open just one present on Christmas Day - a £9.99 Miranda DVD, before he and his mother tuck into whatever they can find in the fridge at their home in Ashford, Middlesex.

'People might call me a Scrooge but I’m not. I would love to have a table groaning with treats and piles of presents for William,' she told The Sunday Mirror's Gemma Aldridge. 

'But the fact is that my son’s ­education is more important to me than his happiness on one day of the year, so I’d rather cancel Christmas because I know he’ll thank me later.'

William had been offered a place at a state school near their home, but despite its 'good' Ofsted rating, Miss Bradford decided early on that she would send her son to private school.

Having left school herself at 16 with no qualifications, Miss Bradford says she is determined to give her son the advantages she never had - even if that means forgoing Christmas excesses, such as trips to a pantomime and stockings full of presents, to pay for it. 

William, pictured with the family dog Matilda, says he is 'sad' he won't get any presents, but is happy his mother works so hard to send him to a good school

Miss Bradford separated from William's father six years ago, and though he supports her decision to send her son to a fee-paying school, Ms Bradford says she pays for the boy's education, which includes lessons in Sanskrit and Latin.

Before the split, Miss Bradford said she and her ex had given William a perfect Christmas, but she found that come New Year's Day much of the money she had spent on food and toys had seemed wasted. 

So this year she decided to strip back the celebrations and instead put the family resources into giving William the gift of education after saving all year to pay the bill, due in January.

Self-employed writer and broadcaster Miss Bradford has previously told the Daily Mail that she is 'motivated by a desire to do what I believe is best for my child'.

She says she works 'all hours' to put her son through school, and if he moans, she reminds him just how lucky he is to be receiving a private education. 

William said:'I feel sad I won’t get many presents. I’m happy mum works so hard to send me to a good school, but if money was no issue I’d want an Oculus Rift virtual 3D headset for playing computer games.'
