Craig Gardner laughs off the suggestion he signed for West Bromwich Albion this summer simply to score a hat-trick of West Midlands clubs, having started at Aston Villa before switching to Birmingham City.

But he admits his enthusiasm had waned during a three-year spell at Sunderland and believes returning to the hotbed of tribalism he used to call home will trigger a purple period in his career.

‘It’s not a puzzle that I’m trying to complete, it’s a career I want to fulfil,’ explains Gardner, born in Solihull. ‘People say Sunderland is only three hours away but it’s that you’re not seeing your friends every day, you’re not seeing your family every day. If you’re happy at home you’re happy at your job.

Keeping up appearances: Craig Gardner signed for West Bromwich Albion at the beginning of the summer 

Having a laugh! The midfielder refuted suggestions he wanted to complete a Midlands hat-trick

‘I’m a Brummie through and through as it’s where I feel I’ve played my best football. I had a good career at Villa, a really good career at Birmingham, and I want to better that now at West Brom.’

Gardner, a Birmingham fan as a boy, is well versed in the tangled rivalries having been brought up in a house of six brothers whose allegiances are split. ‘There’s always fights going on,’ he says.

His brother Gary, 22, plays for and supports Villa, penning a new contract at the club this summer despite suffering lengthy injuries the past couple of seasons. Last week he played a prank on his older sibling by buying Craig’s two daughters claret-and-blue kits with ‘Niece’ on the backs and posting a photograph on Twitter.

‘He got me,’ says Gardner, 27, with a smile. ‘But as I told him, what goes around comes around. There’s a bit more toilet roll in the house now!’

The episode gives an illustration of what Gardner had missed during his time at Sunderland; regular interaction with his large family and snappy mickey-taking. ‘Banter,’ he says.

Gardner left Villa in January 2010 when opportunities became limited, with manager Martin O’Neill able to pick from a number of expensive signings.

Now it is West Brom paying eight-figure fees, as they did for Nigerian centre forward Brown Ideye, and capturing the likes of Joleon Lescott, who Villa had wanted. ‘We’re going out spending £10million on a striker and bringing in Joleon and other players who Premier League teams are after,’ says Gardner. ‘They’re choosing us. I think West Brom are on the up.

‘When I was there Villa had Gareth Barry, Ashley Young, John Carew, Stiliyan Petrov, James Milner, Stewart Downing. We had some top-class players and were fighting for the top six.’

The purse strings have tightened since then and brother Gary, an academy graduate with England Under 21 caps, may have a leading role to perform this season.

‘I ask him after all the training sessions how he’s fitting in, how he’s done, how’s Roy Keane,’ says Gardner. ‘I’m his biggest fan. It shows how good he is when he’s been injured for two years and they give him another contract. This season is a big one for him.’

It is a campaign that Gardner wants to seize too. He was limited to substitute appearances as Sunderland pulled off a ‘miracle’ survival under Gus Poyet. He did not start a league game after December 4. A move to the Hawthorns ‘really nearly happened in January’.

Looking ahead: Gardner, formerly of Aston Villa and Birmingham, wants to seize this season at West Brom 

His first game in a West Brom shirt will be the visit of Sunderland on Saturday.

‘Even though I wasn’t getting the game time it was hard to dislike Gus because he’s a good manager,’ Gardner says.

His boss now is Alan Irvine, a head coach whose appointment initially shocked fans. But his credibility is increasing as a growing contingent of players enthuse over his methods.

‘Before you judge him you need to watch his training sessions, you need to be in the dressing room, you need to really know him,’ says Gardner. ‘On the training pitch we get well-set drills that relate to proper games. He doesn’t just talk for the sake of it. I’ve worked under a lot of people but coach-wise Alan is probably the best. He’s very, very good.’

Gardner thinks striker Ideye, who scored 33 goals in 74 games at Dynamo Kiev, can cause a surprise too.

‘He runs the channels, gets hold of the ball, can turn and he knows where the net is. Not many people know what he’s like and they might give him that extra yard. That’s all it needs nowadays.’

Happy days! Gardner moved back to the Midlands on a free after a spell up in Sunderland 

On a personal level Gardner, a sweet striker of the ball from distance, has set himself a target of 10 goals from midfield to ensure last season’s 17th-place finish was truly a ‘blip’ for the Baggies.

‘I can sit here and say we want to finish in the top eight. But is it realistic, is it unrealistic? We want to finish as high up the table as we can. I think we’re going to have a really good season.’

The best moment in his career was winning the League Cup with Birmingham in 2011, only for the worst moment to follow three months later with relegation to the Championship. He scored 10 goals that campaign.

‘Looking back now you’d rather have stayed up than won the cup,’ he admits, adding that wherever he went in the second city during that time supporters would encourage and cajole.

‘Even close friends and family said, “Come on, any chance of winning today?” I’m back in that environment. It’s where I want to be. You’re getting judged by the people who love you. It’s a good buzz.’
