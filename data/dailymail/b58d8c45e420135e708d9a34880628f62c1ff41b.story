Scientists are learning how children's brains change as they develop intellectual abilities like reading and math - by letting them watch Sesame Street.

The team at the University of Rochester are using brain scans to study watching to children's TV show to see how neural pathways change as we develop.

They say it could pave the way for new understanding of brain development, and even lead to new therapies for learning disabilities.

What your brain looks like on Big Bird: One one the team's neural maps. The fMRI scan on the left represents correlations in neural activity between children and adults, in the middle between children and other children, and on the right between adults and other adults.

Unlike X-rays, CAT scans, and other 
types of brain imaging, fMRI involves no risks, injections, surgery, or 
exposure to radiation. Using magnetic fields, the scans virtually 
segment the brain into a three-dimensional grid of about 40,000 pixels, 
known as voxels, and measure the neural signal intensity in each of 
those tiny sectors.

For example, researchers have compared scans of adults watching an entertaining movie to see if neural responses are similar across different individuals.

'But this is the first study to use the method as a tool for understanding development,' said lead author Jessica Cantlon, a cognitive scientist at the University of Rochester.

Eventually, that understanding may help pinpoint the cause when a child experiences difficulties mastering school work.

'Psychologists have behavioral tests for trying to get the bottom of learning impairments, but these new imaging studies provide a totally independent source of information about children's learning based on what's happening in the brain,' says Cantlon.

For the investigation, 27 children 
between the ages of 4 and 11, and 20 adults watched the same 20-minute 
Sesame Street video.

Like the regular program, the recording featured a 
variety of short clips focused on numbers, words, shapes, and other 
subjects.

The researchers analysed brains scans of both children and adults as they watched Sesame Street characters, such as Bird Bird, shown here, to see how their brains developed as they learnt

The study produced 609 scans of each participant, one every two seconds, as they watched Big Bird, the Count, Elmo and other stars of the educational series. Using statistical algorithms, the researchers then created 'neural maps' of the thought processes for the children and the adults and compared the groups.

The children then took standardized IQ tests for math and 
verbal ability.

Children whose neural maps more closely resembled the neural maps of adults scored higher on standardized math and verbal tests.

In other words, the brain's neural structure, like other parts of the body, develops along predictable pathways as we mature, the team said.

The study also confirmed where in the brain these developing abilities are located. For verbal tasks, adult-like neural patterns in the Broca area, which is involved in speech and language, predicted higher verbal test scores in children.

Puppeteer Jerry Nelson, who died last year, is shown with 'Sesame Street' character Count von Count. Researchers are using the show to study how we learn

For math, better scores were linked to more mature patterns in the intraparietal sulcus (IPS), a region of the brain known to be involved in the processing of numbers.

Although the study does not advocate TV watching, it does show that 'neural patterns during an everyday activity like watching television are related to a person's intellectual maturity,' says Cantlon.

'It's not the case that if you put a child in front of an educational TV program that nothing is happeningâ€“that the brain just sort of zones out. Instead, what we see is that the patterns of neural activity that children are showing are meaningful and related to their intellectual abilities.'
