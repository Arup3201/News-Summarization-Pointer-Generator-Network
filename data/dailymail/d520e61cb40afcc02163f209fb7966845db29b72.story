Paul Smith’s rematch with world champion Arthur Abraham will take place in Berlin on February 21.

Smith pushed the WBO super-middleweight title holder all the way in what was a close contest in September.

But the ringside judges disagreed, with one awarding Abraham victory by a staggering 10 rounds.

That led to calls for an immediate rematch which has now been agreed and which will be held at the O2 Arena. 

Smith told Sky Sports News: 'It was a close fight but believe I won the fight.

'It was a travesty the way it was scored.

'Arthur has been true to his word, he said he would give me a rematch. He told me at the press conference that he's going to knock me out, as he did last time.

'I know I can improve and hit another level, but I don't think he can. I know I'll get a fair crack of the whip this time.'

Abraham said: 'I'm a man of my word. I promised Paul that I would give him a rematch after our first fight in Kiel. I will honour that promise.

'However, Paul should be careful what he wishes for. I’ve already beaten him once and this time I plan to win in even more spectacular fashion.'

Both boxers will be in Liverpool on Thursday to officially announce the fight.

Abraham, 34, is in his second spell as the WBO’s champion having initially held the belt for five months from August 2012.

He lost it in his rematch with Robert Stieglitz but regained it a year later with a split-decision victory in their trilogy clash.

Smith, who is two years younger than the champion, had won four fights since losing to George Groves in 2011 before challenging Abraham.
