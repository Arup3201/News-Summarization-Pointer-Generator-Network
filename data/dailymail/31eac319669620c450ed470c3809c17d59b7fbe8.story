A police inspector has had his award-winning Twitter account and blog suspended by West Midlands Police over allegations of misuse.

Inspector Michael Brown’s account had 16,700 followers and his blog, Mental Health Cop, was praised by experts for explaining the policing of mental health since 2011.

But today it emerged that his account had been taken down by police bosses on the grounds he had been misusing the social media.

Taken down: The account, which had 16,700 followers, can no longer be accessed, nor can his blog

The force refused to reveal details of the suspected misuse, but announced their on-going investigation is expected to last several days.

A police spokesman said: 'West Midlands Police has a force social media policy which details how channels, such as Twitter, should be used by officers in both an official and personal capacity.

'As a force, the Corporate Communications Department monitors all corporate use and should any inappropriate or operationally sensitive communication be identified, this will be taken up with the individual.

Recognition: Inspector Brown has won numerous awards, including the 2012 Chief Constable Award for outstanding contribution to mental health

'In serious cases, the matter would be referred to the force’s Professional Standards Department.

'Recent monitoring has led to the suspension of an account operated by a response inspector whose focus was on mental health policing.

'Certain aspects of the officer’s communication is currently being investigated for alleged misuse of a force account and as such it would be inappropriate for the account to continue whilst further enquiries are made.

'Any breaches of force policy are taken extremely seriously and will be thoroughly and professionally investigated.'

Acting chief constable Garry Forsyth added: 'Our policy is intended to enable officers and staff to communicate with our communities effectively to offer an insight into our work.

'It does impose some restrictions but we are, of course, an organisation that holds sensitive information so we have to ensure that there is some restraint.

'I also can’t imagine any organisation that would want its employees to be openly critical of it - or indeed allow it.

'The policy is not intended to discourage personal perspectives and I believe a human element assists with engagement.'

Inspector Brown, 39, has won numerous awards, includingthe Mind Digital Media award, handed to him by Stephen Fry, the Chief Constable's Award 2012 for outstanding contribution to mental health.

In 2007, he was awarded the prestigious Bramshill Fellowship to study policing and mental health.

He has also been a visiting lecturer on mental health and has helped his colleagues with his knowledge documented on his site.

The blog includes hundreds of articles touching on issues ranging from the use of physical force by officers to the prevalence of mental health problems within the force itself.

Alongside these are tools such as an FAQs section and digested guides to complex aspects of mental health legislation.

The account and blog suspension has led to his avid followers taking to Twitter to express their anger.

Twitter user @appleblossom tweeted: 'appalling decision. He engaged & educated . Idiots that made this decision'

Dawn Willis‏ said: 'Mental Health Cop is a valuable asset in breaking down stigma within #MentalHealth. I hope to see him back very soon! #Police.'

While @CaoilfhionnGallagher‏ added: 'Still outraged & saddened by suspension of @MentalHealthCop blog & Twitter.'
