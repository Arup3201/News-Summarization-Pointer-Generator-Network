The double-fatal crash that killed an Ohio groom hours after the wedding has led to charges against his friend who was driving.

Timothy Tebbe, 34, was driving newlyweds Andrew and Ruth Bloomfield home from buying their wedding present, a bottle of Moonshine, when the pick-up truck hurtled into a ditch in a cornfield.

Andrew, 27, and the couple's friend, Liz Shelton, were killed in the incident on October 12.

Tragic: Timothy Tebbe, 34, (left) was driving his newly-wedded friends Andrew and Ruth Bloomfield (right) to buy their present, a bottle of Moonshine, when the car careered into a ditch in a cornfield, killing Andrew

Charged: Tebbe is facing six counts of dangerous driving for the crash on October 12 that also killed another

Ruth suffered serious injuries to her leg that has left her unable to walk.

But the widow has hit out at authorities for indicting Tebbe, who is now facing six charges including aggravated vehicular homicide and vehicular assault.

'I want to forget the whole entire accident. I can never forget that day.' Mrs Bloomfield told WBNS-TV. 

According to Wyandot County Sheriff, Tebbe was driving at 100mph.

The bride disagrees and says the vehicle wasn't traveling that fast.  

Defending: Ruth Bloomfield says she doesn't want Tebbe to be jailed and claims he was not driving 100mph

Mourning: Mrs Bloomfield says Tebbe has suffered enough following the death of his two close friends 

'He wasn't speeding when we got in the accident,' she said. 'He would never go that fast.' 

She tells WBNS-TV she understands the charges but doesn't want Tebbe in prison and thinks he's suffered enough with the loss of two friends. 

Friends have paid tribute to Andrew Bloomfield, and described how excited he was to marry Ruth Driskill.

His last Facebook post read: 'Ready to start a new chapter being married. I never thought I would find that person to settle down with but I guess I just got lucky. Soon I will be a married man.'
