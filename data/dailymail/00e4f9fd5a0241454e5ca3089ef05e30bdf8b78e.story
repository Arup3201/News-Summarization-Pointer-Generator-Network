Reddit use 'loserfame' has won eternal online bragging rights after posting a series of photos taken in 2012 when he and two friends snuck into the empty Houston Astrodome and gave themselves a beer-fueled tour.

The Houston Astros vacated the stadium in 2003, and it had sat empty for years before the anonymous trio snuck through a fence onto the property.

That same year the Houston Chronicle would send a photographer of their own to profile the ruins during daylight hours, and sober.

Reddit use 'loserfame' posted a series of photos taken in 2012 when he and two friends snuck into the empty Houston Astrodome

The group could be charged with trespassing but say they meant no harm

A ladder found in what appeared to be a closet let the group even go up onto the roof

Deadspin notes that one of the red beer cups they left behind can even be seen in the Chronicle's photographs of the control room.

'After making it in through a gap in the fence, we were stunned to find out that [where] we snuck in on led straight onto the field,' said read one caption. 'It's kind of hard to tell, but you can see that all of the lights were on in the main hallways which we thought was strange, but definitely helped us explore!'

The Houston Chronicle reports that upon finding a ladder they were able to go all the way up to the roof. 

The stadium has been abandoned since the Atros left in 2003

Images show the ruins and cobwebs inside the long abandoned stadium

The Astrodome has since been cleaned up with many seats sold and removed

The lucky group even left a red beer cup behind later photographed by the Houston Chronicle

The stadium is still standing as no one seems sure what to do with it

One unidentified man wrote on the captions they had no ill-intent

The Astrodome is now locked up tighter and harder to break into

He wrote: 'It went up about 15ft to a hatch that wasn't locked. So we popped our head out and there was the roof. To the Astrodome. It was surreal.'

County judge spokesman Joe Stinebaker told the Chronicle: 'Aside from the inherent danger, the county can, and will, prosecute' people who would break in.

One unidentified man wrote on the captions they had no ill-intent.

'We were NOT in there to vandalize, steal, or damage any property. Just there to see how the ol' dome was doing!' he wrote. 'I would NOT recommend and do not condone trespassing on private property. I don't think the building is safe anymore so don't do it!' 

County judge spokesman Joe Stinebaker said his office would prosecute anyone who broke in

While still empty the stadium has since been cleaned up with many seats removed and sold off.

It's also now far harder to break into the place. 

The Redditor's images capture the eerie decay of the place, including the cobwebbed corners and then-useless equipment. 

Online reaction hailed the group as heroic for the adventure

The men have managed to remain anonymous even as their images go viral
