A graphic designer was left paralysed from the neck down and fighting for his life after catching a common cold.

Derek Ledingham, 41, has spent the past seven months in hospital after developing the rare nerve condition Guillain-Barre syndrome. 

The illness, which only affects one in two million people, attacks the body's peripheral nervous system after a viral or bacterial infection such as the common cold.

Graphic designer Derek Ledingham, 41, has been left paralysed  in hospital for seven months after developing the rare nerve condition Guillain-Barre syndrome

The paralysis was caused by his body overreacting to a common cold, and then attacking the nervous system. Mr Ledingham has recently managed to take his first few steps

He has only recently taken his first steps and has set his sights on being back home in Aberdeen by the end of the year. 

Mr Ledingham said: 'This year has been a write-off for me. 

'I came into hospital and it was winter time and I'll leave in winter time.'

He came down with a severe cold last New Year and was unable to shake it off for months.

But after playing in a local football match in March, he woke the following day unable to move his legs.

When he arrived at Aberdeen Royal Infirmary for emergency treatment, doctors were initially baffled.

He had the symptoms of a severe stroke, but his heart was fine.

Within days he had lost control of his arms, was struggling to breathe and was transferred to intensive care, where his condition worsened until he was almost totally paralysed.

It was then that specialists realised he had Guillain-Barre syndrome, a rare condition where the body's immune system attacks the nervous system.

The nerves become inflamed and stop working, which can lead to pain, tingling, muscle weakness, unsteadiness and lack of co-ordination.

Guillain-Barre syndrome (pronounced Ghee-lan Bar-ray) syndrome is a rare but serious condition of the nerves that control the body's senses and movements.

It affects about 1,500 people in the UK every year and is slightly more common in men than women.

It causes the immune system (the body's natural defence against infection and illness) to attack these nerves, causing them to become inflamed.

The exact cause of GBS is unknown, but most people - around 60 per cent of sufferers - develop the condition shortly after having a viral or bacterial infection.

The symptoms of GBS usually develop between one and three weeks after a minor infection.

They often start in your hands and feet before spreading to your arms and legs. Initially a person suffering the condition may experience:

- pain, tingling and numbness

- progressive muscle weakness

- co-ordination problems and unsteadiness

Weakness is likely to affect both sides of the body and gets worse over several days.

Around 80 per cent of people make a full recovery within a few weeks or months, and do not have any further problems such as permanent nerve damage.

In rare cases such as Mr Ledinghams, the muscle weakness can lead to paralysis as well as difficulty breathing and speaking.

Mr Ledingham said: 'I had a cold last New Year and I couldn't shake it.

'Eventually my runny nose stopped, but I kept on coughing. I started to feel really tired every single day and couldn't place why.

'I thought I maybe just needed a good weekend to catch up on my sleep.

'On the Sunday morning it started I woke up and felt like I had a dead leg.

'It was bizarre, but I didn't think anything of it.'

He went to his football team's match and pulled on his kit and played, despite feeling under the weather.

The next day he woke up paralysed.

He said: 'On the Monday morning I woke up and both my legs were just gone.

'On the Tuesday morning when I woke, I couldn't get out of bed. I couldn't move my arms, I couldn't eat.

'Doctors told me I would get worse before I got better, but by mid-afternoon, I was struggling to breathe and I was hiked up to intensive care.'

About 80 per cent of people who contract Guillain-Barre syndrome do recover, but the process can take anywhere between several weeks and a year.

Mrs Ledingham said: 'The first week or two I was saying "why has it happened to me?".

'Then it was a case of saying "it has happened to me and I'll fight it". 

'I'm quite determined - in this situation, you have to be. If you feel sorry for yourself you'll never get out of it.

'Now I can walk, I can feed myself. Every day I'm getting stronger and stronger.'

However, the die-hard Aberdeen FC fan fears he will never play his beloved sport again.

But despite battling with the condition - he has made it to every game home game the team play at Pittodrie stadium in Aberdeen.

He said: 'I hope that everything heals to a point where I can live my life as normal and find a way to adapt, and lead a regular life, go to work Monday to Friday, and have a beer at the weekend.

'There's no reason why I shouldn't be able to do that in time. My friends and family have kept me going.' 

Seven months later, he said: 'Now I can walk, I can feed myself. Every day I'm getting stronger and stronger'
