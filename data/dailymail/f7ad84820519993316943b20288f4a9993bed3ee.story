Mecklenburg-Vorpommern is quite a mouthful.

Which is why locals refer to this region of lakes, castles, and beaches in the North-east of Germany as MV, or Meck-Pom. The Pom refers to Pomerania, now mostly in Poland.

It has a long coastline on the Baltic and is the third largest of Germany's 16 Laender - but the least populated. So you can walk for miles on a sandy strand or drive all day on the autobahn and not see a sausage, except in your lunch.

Back in focus: 'Meck-Pom' offers blissful beaches along Germany's Baltic Sea coastline

After World War II, Meck-Pom was part of Communist East Germany, which might account for its low profile. The regime concentrated on the cities and neglected the countryside, so castles and seaside resorts deteriorated.

Since reunification 25 years ago, all that has changed. The result is a clutch of wonderful hotels and beautifully-run resorts.

The sea accounts for the region's ancient wealth and the cities along the coast - Wismar, Rostock, Stralsund and Greifswald - were part of the 13th-century trading confederation, the Hanseatic League, which did business with Scandinavians and Slavs around the Baltic.

Two of the cities, Wismar and Stralsund, are World Heritage Sites.

Towering medieval cathedrals and customs houses on market squares as big as football pitches are built of ancient revolutionary red-brick, moulded and baked from the sodden clay. The harbour has bars, cafes and shops for windsurfers, anglers and bucket-and-spaders.

On the road, go-kart tracks and wildlife parks fill gaps between the farms and forests. A day's fishing off a boat costs €39 (£27), including lunch from a stewpot.

At the beach resorts of Boltenhagen and Warnemunde, holidaymakers on hire bikes (£6.50 a day) pedal through pine-filled parks to the sea-front.

A steam train called Molli plies a coastal route to Heiligendamm, location of the five-star Grand Hotel. It has a sanatorium, a Michelin-star chef, a castle (for weddings) and a children's house with games.

Meck-Pom is a refuge in peace and war. Forewarned of the Allied bombing, citizens of Hamburg, Berlin and Dresden fled here.

'The castles were full of refugees,' says Freiherr Helmuth von Maltzahn, proprietor of 16th-century Schloss Ulrichshusen, which his ancestor Ulrich built among the inland lakes.

Helmuth, born in 1949, bought back his burnt-out family home and turned it into a 40-room hotel.

At sunset, cranes fly over the lakes in their thousands in what looks, for a moment, like an intricate, interweaving MV-formation.

British Airways (0844 493 0787, www.ba.com) flies to Hamburg from £79 return.

Double rooms at the Grand Hotel Heiligendamm (www.grandhotel-heiligendamm.de/en) cost from £136, on a B&B basis.
