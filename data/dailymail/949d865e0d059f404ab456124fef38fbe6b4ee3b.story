A hairdresser who says she can hear what people's pets are 'saying' is being paid up to £100 a time by worried owners.

Real-ife Dr Dolittle Mandy Carr, 39, claims to have an unusual affinity with animals that helps her know what they are 'saying' or feeling.

Mrs Carr, from Sheffield, says she can even channel messages from dead pets, and claims to have helped diagnose a dog in Australia with kidney problems.

Psychic powers: Mandy Carr is paid by worried pet owners to channel messages from their animals

She says she first discovered her gift at 20 when she was cutting someone's hair and heard an unusual voice begging for a treat.

She said: 'When I realised it was my client's dog, it scared me half to death. I didn't know if I was normal or mad.

'I only have to look at a pet's picture and I can feel their ailments and listen to whatever they choose to tell me - which often includes telling tales on their owners.

'I'll be driving and I'll hear one of my clients' cats and I'll think to myself "Oh blimey not now", but unfortunately I can't decide when they need me.'

Mrs Carr was born deaf and wears two hearing aids, but says she has always had a special connection with animals and belives being deaf has heightened her psychic powers.

She claims she can link in with dead pets to pass on messages from beyond the grave, describing herself as a 'channeller between two worlds'.

For £100, Mrs Carr, who says she donates most of her earnings to animal charities, will stay with a beloved pet in its dying hours and fulfil its final requests.

The pet psychic also says her powers can work long-range: recently she was contacted by the owners of a sickly golden retriever in Australia.

Mrs Carr managed to 'diagnose' a kidney complaint and help the dog, Nala, overcome rejection fears after her owners split up later.

When Nala died Mrs Carr was also able to connect to her on the 'spirit plane' and let her owner know she was OK.

Mrs Carr says that sometimes the pets want to tell tales on their owners

She said: 'Nala also told me about her owner getting another dog, and that it would be a puppy and linked to the owner's work.

'The owner didn't want another dog as she had just lost her beloved pet but sure enough a few weeks later all her bosses at work clubbed together and bought her another puppy and brought him to her at work.'

Mrs Carr says she was particularly moved by an encounter with toy poodle Zak, whose brother was killed by a pack of greyhounds.

Zak's owner, Jay Westwood-Bowman, visited the animal medium after the incident in a last attempt to understand the poodle's puzzling behaviour.

He said: 'I was really sceptical but willing to try anything because Zak just didn't want anything to do with us, or anyone.

'Within 10 minutes he was back to normal and we were in disbelief.  I haven't got a clue how she does it, but whatever it is, it works. We were just overjoyed.'

Mrs Carr, who will next month take up a post as a pet agony
aunt for spiritual magazine Cheeky Angels, has no pets of her own as her husband Paul's family are severely allergic.
