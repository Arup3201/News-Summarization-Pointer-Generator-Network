More than two thirds of top-level managers across Europe want a winter break, a League Managers Association study has revealed.

A number of head coaches from across the continent, covering 20 different nationalities, were polled and the proposition of a mid-season rest period won resounding favour.

In another key finding the majority of managers would like the transfer window to remain open all season so signings can be made at any time.

Give it a rest! Arsenal manager Arsene Wenger has long been a vocal supporter of winter breaks

The results come in the Annual Castrol European Managers & Coaches Survey, which quizzes bosses on a variety of topics including the introduction of technology in football, which 93 per cent of respondents agreed was a positive step.

But it is the clear backing for a winter break – 70 per cent are in favour – that could gain most traction and potentially force a change in Premier League scheduling.

Arsene Wenger has long called for the move in English football and last April claimed German teams’ recent success was down to the Bundesliga operating a six-week pause between mid-December and late January.

‘When you are an English club or a Spanish club, you have a handicap - that is for sure,’ he said.

Mesut Ozil was said to have suffered this season after a sparkling start to life in England because he was unable to rest midway through and fatigue set in. And most of the continent’s top coaches agree with Wenger.

The other interesting development is that the majority of managers want an transfer window open all year long.

In agreement: Sam Allardyce (L) and Jose Mourinho would both support a season-long transfer window

Increasingly those in charge at Premier League clubs have bemoaned the summer and winter windows as unnecessarily prohibitive, claiming prices are pushed up, panic increases and agents prosper.

Sam Allardyce and Jose Mourinho, two unlikely bedfellows, are in agreement on this issue.

Other results of the survey found that 67 per cent of respondents considered the recruitment of players as becoming the most important part of the job and 73 per cent opposed the idea of the introduction of an orange card to be given to players with a yellow card as a ‘final warning’.

Sir Alex Ferguson, an LMA board member, said the poll was important, while Carlo Ancelotti insisted the results should be listened to.

‘Football is a universal language and the collection of such information is invaluable,’ Ferguson said.

‘This survey covers leadership and management as well as other key technical issues in football so it deals with the issues that affect managers each and every day.

‘The findings of this survey are particularly intriguing and demonstrate the range of views across European football.’

Real Madrid manager Ancelotti added: ‘As the role of a manager and coach continues to evolve in the modern game it is vital that our views are not just collected but considered as, despite the range of models across Europe, the manager/head coach maintains responsibility for results.
