Police are investigating if a toddler who became unconscious and critically injured was knocked over by his family dogs.

The three-year-old boy of Oberon, in the NSW Central Tablelands, suffered head injuries in an incident while walking with his mother and step-father in a park at about 1pm on Sunday.

Chifley Local Area Command Crime Manager Detective Inspector Luke Rankin said police were told the boy's injuries were caused after he got tangled in the leads of an Alsatian and a husky when the animals became loose, reported the Western Advocate.

Det Inspt Rankin said police were told the boy had been 'knocked' down and 'stuck' on his head as a result of the incident.

'Our prominent line of inquiry is we are trying to establish if the child has injuries consistent with what the parents have told us,' he said.

When the young boy became unconscious, he was taken home where emergency services were called.

Despite being treated by paramedics, he was later airlifted to Westmead Children's Hospital in Sydney in a critical condition.

He remains in hospital although his condition had started to stabilise as of Monday morning.
