In the words of its famous adverts, this is not just any portion of fish and chips … this is Marks and Spencer fish and chips. And it comes in a pie – complete with a layer of mushy peas.

The extraordinary creation is made from chunks of cod, pea puree and tartar sauce, all held together in shortcrust pastry and topped off with a chip ‘lid’.

Designed to treat indecisive eaters to a mixture of two traditional favourites of British cuisine, the pie is due to hit the shelves later this month, priced at £3.49.

And for those fearing something of a calorie overload, a spokesman claimed they are slightly lower in calories than most pies, and have around half the amount found in a take-away fish and chip supper. 

Each pie contains 581 calories – just over a quarter of a woman’s recommended daily intake, and a little more than a fifth of a man’s – and includes 31g of fat, 44 per cent of the daily allowance.

According to the M&S spokesman, the pies are nutritionally on a par with a typical BLT sandwich.

Ahead of the new creation hitting shelves on April 22, the company – which sells 21million pies a year – said: ‘Specially handcrafted in Yorkshire, each pie is lovingly created with top quality fillings made in small batches for a truly delicious taste of the seaside.’

M&S food developer Matt Dawson said: ‘Creating this pie has been the culmination of lots of love and hard work from our development team.’
