Repairing a road sign should be a simple enough job.

But not for one council – which says it has to consult with 22 organisations before it can even begin to put it back up.

As a result, the sign has remained hidden in the undergrowth by the side of the road for more than two years.

Somerset County Council had to consult 22 bodies before starting repair work on a damaged sign just outside the village or Tarnock, in Badgworth

Local MPs have been campaigning on behalf of the residents of Tarnock in Somerset to have it fixed.

But Somerset County Council said it had a statutory duty to consult with nearly two dozen bodies before reinstating the sign, which marks a junction leading to the village of Mark on the A38.

Among the 22 organisations being consulted over wires and pipes are Virgin Media, Orange, the National Grid and Wales & West Utilities. The situation was described as ‘barmy’ by the leader of the Commons, William Hague last month.

Asked about the issue by Tessa Munt, Liberal Democrat MP for Wells, he replied: ‘It does sound fairly barmy if they have to consult so many people.’

Mrs Munt, who brought up the problem in the House of Commons, said: ‘There has to be a quicker way.’

But Somerset County Council said fixing the sign was not a top priority.

‘We have a legal obligation to gather relevant information before we carry out work,’ a spokesman said.

He added: ‘We agree with William Hague. It does sound barmy, but it’s what councils have to do.

‘That’s not the issue here. We’re not waiting to hear back from anyone, it’s just a case of priorities.’

He went on: ‘This isn’t a sign that has any road safety benefit so it has to wait while we do things that we have to consider higher priority.

‘We’ve not been made aware that this is causing a problem and it’s somewhat surprising that it’s a subject that has been discussed in the House of Commons.’

However, the council could avoid having to repair the sign at all – as from next year, excessive speed limit signs and other ‘unnecessary clutter’ will be removed from British roads in the biggest shake-up of traffic signage since the 1960s.

New guidelines to be issued to councils will end the need for road signs that repeatedly remind drivers of speed limits.

Ministers were ‘alarmed’ to learn that the number of road signs had doubled from two million in 1993 to more than 4.6 million today.

Paul Watters, the AA’s head of roads policy, said: ‘Road signs are placed to warn, inform, regulate and direct drivers but they have multiplied almost uncontrollably over the last few decades.’

He added: ‘Getting the balance right will be difficult – sign clutter is a problem but we should not cut back on signs that stop drivers speeding or parking badly.’

The road sign debacle is not the first time this year that Somerset council has come under criticism.

In August it emerged that it was home to Britain’s biggest earning council boss, who reportedly earned £318,500 a year for a four-day week.

Peter Lewis, who is no longer employed by the council, was also said to have channelled his income as Director of Children’s Services in a way that potentially allowed him to avoid paying tens of thousands in income tax and national insurance.
