Christian Benteke is still to fully recover from his hip injury but is in contention for a return to the Aston Villa team for Saturday’s crucial match against Sunderland.

The Belgian striker missed Villa’s FA Cup victory over West Bromwich Albion after suffering the problem in training but has improved and should be in the squad, manager Tim Sherwood said.

Sherwood could yet continue with the attacking line-up that got Villa to the FA Cup semi-final for the important relegation encounter at the Stadium of Light.

That would mean Gabriel Agbonlahor up top, supported by Charles N’Zogbia and Scott Sinclair on the wings. ‘Christian's still feeling it,’ said Sherwood. 

‘He’ll be in the squad, we’ll give him as much time as we can to get him fit. All I need to know is when he’ll be back fit and he’s got an opportunity to be fit for this weekend.

'But we changed it around and the boys that came in did well. We’re not always looking for one guy. It’s a team effort, we have to attack together and defend together. There is no onus on one person to score the goals.

'I don’t think Christian feels the pressure, it doesn’t look like it.’ Sherwood also reflected on the pitch invasion at the end of last Saturday’s 2-0 victory over West Brom, which marred the result in the eyes of many. Sherwood joked he would agree to a replay.

'No-one wants to see anyone enter the field of play while the match is still going on. If we have to replay the game we’re happy to do that,’ he laughed.

'It didn’t take the shine off for me. Other people can deal with the aftermath of what was a very jubilant crowd on the pitch.'
