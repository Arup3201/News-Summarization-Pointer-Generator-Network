Katrina-Kay Howard was left with horrific injuries after she was attacked after asking for directions following a Halloween night out in Bedford 

A model was left partially blind after she was set upon by a group on Halloween after she asked for directions. 

Katrina-Kay Hayward, 22, tried to stop two men who started punching her male friend but was punched to the floor. 

She was left with blood on her arms and  three fractures to her face.

She had been walking home after a Halloween night out with two friends through Bedford city centre when the trio were stopped two men and two girls.

The group then turned on her male friend. 

After the attack the part time model needed stitches on her right eye. 

She is now facing a wait to find out if she suffered any permanent damage to the eye,  which currently has no vision.

The injuries are making it difficult for her to carry on working.  

She said: 'I pleaded with them to stop and told them there was no problem but I got punched to the floor.

'I put my hands to my face and my arms got covered in blood.

'I am not sleeping well, and it is hard to adjust to being partially blind, but I have bills to pay. 

'I need to work.'

Her friend escaped with cuts and bruises while her friend Jess Cook, 21, was not injured. The trio had been walking back from Play nightclub in Bedford at about 4am on Sunday. 

Miss Cook said: 'It all happened so quickly and I was in shock. I heard my friend's head hit the floor and was making sure he was OK when I realised what had happened to Katrina.

Miss Hayward, 22, tried to stop the attackers hitting her boyfriend when they turned on her and punched her 

The part time model took pictures after the attack showing the extent of the injuries to her face and eye 

The part-time model said her injuries make it difficult for her to work and she needed stitches near her eye

'Eventually the group ran off and we waited for police to arrive.'

Miss Hayward has now shared her story on Facebook and posted photos of her injuries - which have so far been shared more than 2,000 times.

She added: 'I have a lot of support from people, as well as nasty comments, but I hope it will catch the people who did this.'
