If you live in a fantasy world filled with unicorns, fairy godmothers, dragons and trolls beneath bridges, click your magic heels together and repeat: 'There's no place like Etsy.'

A fairytale footwear fetishist in Salt Lake City, Utah, has cobbled together a pair of ready-to-wear 'unicorn hoof boots' (hoots? boofs? booves?), and is peddling them via the online independent retailer.

The artist, whose Etsy username is Oonacat, is selling her custom-made heelless hooves - which require the wearer to walk on tip-toes and come with both a health warning about dangers and a disclaimer - for $320 (£211), plus shipping costs.

Speaking about her imaginatively idiosyncratic style of shoe, Oonacat said: 'I create unique, high-quality, durable, heelless hoof boots with artistry, function and kick-ass design.

'My passion is that through my creations I stir the air around others. The hidden things in life tend to pull me, so I love to create things that push reality a little sideways.'

Oonacat's hoof boots were fabricated once she had completed extensive research, testing out various materials and methods, and even consulting with special effect professionals. The full-time artist says the resulting boot is 'very durable and artistically pleasing'.

They do, however, come with a health warning and a disclaimer.

Oonacat says: 'Please note that these hooves can be 
dangerous, and you agree by purchasing these thru Etsy, Paypal, and any 
other transaction such as check, cash, or trade with Oonacat that 
Oonacat is not responsible in any way for any harm done to those that 
wear these hooves, nor is Oonacat responsible in any way, to harm done 
to those around those that wear these hooves.

'These are considered 
extreme foot ware, and are to be worn at your own risk.'

On the item's sale page, Oonacat says: 'Rare and elusive, these mythical equine are the creatures of legend and of Otherland.  These beautiful hooves are made to order, and are completely customizable. They are a heelless platform shoe or boot.

'Each one is hand sculpted and cast urethane using professional grade materials only. I take great care to make these durable and beautiful. I consider these a work of art for each customer.'

Oonacat is also happy to make boots in the style of pony, goat, cow, satyr, faun, demon or wolf hooves. And cat paws.

The boots come up to a size 12, anything bigger comes at an extra cost. The buyer must also provide the upper-boot and ship them to Oonacat. This allows the wearer 'more freedom of expression'. Her price covers materials for the heel and her labour costs.
