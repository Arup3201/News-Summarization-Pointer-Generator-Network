Millions of us spend our days slaving over a keyboard. But lurking between the keys, hidden on the mouse and nestled in your phone lies more than 10 million bacteria - 400 times more than on the average toilet seat.

Unhygienic working conditions are a 'key contributor' to the 131 million working days lost each year in the UK and millions more around the world, to illnesses including colds and flu. 

Bacteria and viruses can multiply on hard surfaces, remaining infectious for up to 24 hours, hygiene expert and visiting professor at the University of Salford, Dr Lisa Ackerley told MailOnline.

She said the average desk is a prime breeding ground for infections, before urging people to disinfect their desks, telephones, keyboards and computer mice.

She added that better cleaning and hygiene measures could result in 'significantly fewer sick days'.

Now, a new infographic lays bare the stark reality of how important it is to detox your desk.

It shows one in five workers fail to clean their workspace before eating, while two in three eat lunch at their desk.

Twenty per cent of people never clean their computer mouse, while around 80 per cent of common infections are transmitted by touch.

'Our hands are a germ motorway,' Dr Ackerley told MailOnline. 'The slightest cough or sneeze into our hands and the germs start their journey through the office.

'And if somebody doesn't wash their hands the bacteria or viruses can get on your hands, even if you.'

She said if one member of the office fails to wash their hands, their colleagues can pick up their bacteria by touching the same door handles and surfaces.

Those organisms then risk being transferred when people touch their eyes or mouths, causing colds, coughs, flu, norovirus and food poisoning. 

'Any surfaces your hands come into contact with are potential breeding grounds for bacteria and viruses,' Dr Ackerley said.

'From the moment you touch the toilet flush and cubicle door handle, you are at risk of picking up bacteria.

'Even the soap dispenser can pose a threat. Even if you thoroughly wash your hands, if you touch the door handle on the way out, and it's been touched by someone who hasn't washed their hands you will pick up any residue bacteria.

'These organisms are completely invisible. That is why it is so important everyone takes responsibility for their own personal hand hygiene. It is really important to wash your hands.'

She said a recent survey found nearly 50 per cent of office workers don't wash their hands after going to the toilet.

'There is no excuse,' she said. 'Those people bypassing the sink are spreading germs all around the office.

'Their refusal to wash their hands means someone else is likely to pick up that bacteria, and risk passing it into their bodies when touching their eyes, mouths or faces.

'Cleaning in offices should really focus on any surfaces that come into contact with anyone's hands. It is important to mop the floors, but really it is desks, sinks, handles, anywhere we put our hands - they are the surfaces that are likely to be really dirty.

'We have all got a responsibility.'  

 Dr Ackerley said past studies have found more than 3,000 organisms per square inch on a keyboard, and more than 1,600 on a computer mouse.

 She said 16 per cent of people carry norovirus, which causes vomiting and diarrhoea, but show no symptoms.

'So you may feel perfectly fine and well, but you're carrying around the virus and spreading it around the office,' Dr Ackerley said.  

Hygiene expert Dr Lisa Ackerley, a visiting professor at Salford University, told MailOnline 'our hands are a germ motorway' picking up harmful organisms which cause colds, flu and norovirus, and spreading them around their desk. Pictured in green is bacteria on a desk 

She said washing your hands is key to cutting down on sick days caused by common colds picked up from your desk, and an anti-bacterial disinfectant spray is ideal to kill off the bacteria and viruses, that can live for up to 24 hours on hard surfaces  

She recommended using a hand sanitiser after leaving the bathroom, and over the course of the day.

And advised using anti-bacterial disinfectant sprays to clean your desk.

'Simple hygiene measures can make a marked difference to reducing the spread of bacteria and viruses in the work-place,' she told MailOnline.

'Employees should wash their hands when arriving at work, particularly if they have been on public transport. 

'Office equipment such as telephone handsets, computer keyboards and desks, which are hotspots for viruses and bacteria, and other hard surfaces in regular contact with hands should be cleaned and disinfected regularly using anti-viral and anti-bacterial products such as Dettol Disinfectant Spray which will help to reduce the risk of picking up colds and flu.'

But, she said, one of the most effective ways to stop infection is as simple as washing hands. Dr Ackerley said around half of illnesses can be reduced by people religiously washing their hands during the day, not just after going to the toilet, but also before eating. 

And just 20 seconds of hand washing can stop the journey of the germ.

Ensuring the hands are thoroughly dry after a wash is important too, she added.
