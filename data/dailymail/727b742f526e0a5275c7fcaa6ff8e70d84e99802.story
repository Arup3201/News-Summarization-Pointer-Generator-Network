A scientifically developed soft drink, named Brainwave, has been designed to help you stay 
sharp and keep your brain healthy.

It could also help to reduce the 
chances of developing Alzheimer's disease and dementia later in life, 
say developers.

Brainwave recently commissioned a review of independent and published scientific research into the relationship between green tea intake and cognitive health.

Studies show drinking green tea at a certain level combined with other natural ingredients at a specific dosage encourages positive cognitive health

Results showed a positive relationship between 
drinking green tea at a certain level, combined with other natural 
ingredients at a specific dosage.

Developers say this inspired the product as it is today.

The combination of ingredients in the drink helps the body to absorb the optimal amount of green tea - which has been proven to help to reduce the risk of cognitive degradation.

While published research, 
supported by Newcastle Science City, inspired the drink, developers 
say they will continue to fine tune the product as new data becomes 
available.

However, developers wanted to ensure they interpreted the information properly and commissioned a review

Richard Baister, founder of Brainwave says: 'To develop the drink the Brainwave team gathered research from across the world.

'To ensure we interpreted the 
information properly, we commissioned a review of this research by Dr. 
Edward Okello of Newcastle University’s faculty of Agriculture, Food and
 Rural Development. 

'Dr. Okello is a specialist in the field and his work was the inspiration for Brainwave.

'It is a fact that the study of Alzheimer’s and Dementia is relatively new, in scientific terms, but medical expertise is developing quickly and hopefully it will soon be easier to treat and even prevent these conditions.'

The company pledges to help contribute 
to the fight against Dementia and Alzheimer’s and is donating 25 per 
cent of profits to fund further research and projects helping those 
already living with these conditions.

The 2.5 calorie drink is sold in a minimum multipack of 24 for £35 - avalable only online

It is recommended that Brainwave is consumed daily to maintain optimum long-term brain health, and at 2.5 calories per bottle, it won't be adding inches to your waistline.

The drink is sold in a minimum multipack of 24 for £35, and available only online at brainwavedrinks.com
