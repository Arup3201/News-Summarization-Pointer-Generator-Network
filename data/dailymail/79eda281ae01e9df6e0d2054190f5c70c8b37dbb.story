The schoolgirl whose skull was fractured in the Alps massacre also suffered a serious eye injury and may never be able to give a full account of what happened, it emerged yesterday.

Hopes that French detectives could make an early breakthrough in the case have been dashed by the revelation that seven-year-old Zainab Al-Hilli is still too poorly to be questioned about her horrific ordeal.

It comes as investigators yesterday admitted it could be at least a decade before the mystery of the Alpine murders is finally solved.

Defeatist: French investigators said they are nowhere near finding the killers or establishing a motive for the Alpine shooting massacre which saw four people killed

Doctors treating the little girl at a 
heavily-guarded hospital in Grenoble said she suffered brain injuries in
 the attack in which she was pistol-whipped and shot in the shoulder. 
There are also fears for her sight.

A police source said there was no indication as to the extent of the damage to her vision, but one eye was seriously damaged.

Speaking a week after the atrocity, 
the French prosecutor leading the murder inquiry yesterday admitted it 
could be ‘two, three or ten years’ before the case is solved.

The extent of Zainab’s injuries were 
revealed as it emerged that the former RAF officer who stumbled on the 
carnage while cycling in the Alps last Wednesday has returned to his 
home in England.

The terrified man, who is in his 50s, 
is expected to return to France in the coming days to take part in a 
reconstruction of his journey.

In order not to jeopardise his safety,
 the Mail has decided not to identify the man, a potential key witness 
who was believed to be at a safe address protected by British police 
last night.

Zainab’s father, British engineer Saad
 Al-Hilli, 50, mother Ikbal, 47, and maternal grandmother Suhaila 
Al-Allaf, 74, were shot dead alongside Sylvain Mollier, a 45-year-old 
French cyclist.

Each was shot twice in the head.

The girl was found by the ex-RAF man 
staggering around her family’s BMW estate car which was sprayed with 
bullets close to the village of Chevaline near Lake Annecy.

Her sister Zeena escaped unhurt by hiding under her mother’s body in the car.

Appalling violence: Doctors at the CHU hospital in Grenoble said Zainab may have permanently lost her sight after being pistol-whipped and shot in the shoulder

A police source said Zainab – who 
lived with her family in Claygate, Surrey – suffered ‘multiple facial 
injuries that caused two subdural hematomas and a fractured orbital 
bone’.

A subdural hematoma is a traumatic brain injury which can be life-threatening, while the orbital bone surrounds the eyes.

French prosecutor Eric Maillaud said: 
‘She will, of course, be listened to very specifically, but her doctors 
have got to be able to help her try  to get back to the best possible 
health, and eventually hope she will express herself.’

He said she is a key witness – ‘the 
only person alive who actually could have seen something’ – but warned 
that she is very young and has been ‘very damaged’.

Mr Mailluad also admitted that French 
police are nowhere near finding the killers, let alone establishing a 
motive for the attack.

Asked when the mystery might be 
solved, Mr Maillaud said: ‘We might have the answers in  two, three or 
ten years – it’s a painstaking procedure.’

Referring to US crime fighting drama 
CSI (Crime Scene Investigation), Mr Maillaud said ‘It’s not like the 
American TV series where they solve everything in 45 minutes.’

Mr Maillaud, who will travel to the UK
 today as part of the investigation, said 40 French officers were 
working on the case which has led to a flurry of theories relating to 
possible motives.

But today he admitted that the ‘language barrier’ and diplomatic problems were also slowing the enquiry down.

Suggesting inconsistencies in the 
testament of the mystery British witness, Mr Maillaud said:  ‘We’ll need
 to listen to the British cyclist again - to check his timings. He’ll 
have to get back on his bike and re-do the journey.’

Horrifying details of the attack on Zainab emerged as police also revealed that those killed were ‘no ordinary tourists’.

Briefings by detectives suggested that
 at least one of the victims could have had links to those working in 
international espionage or the criminal underworld

The revelations are not only further 
evidence of the cruelty shown by the criminal responsible, but suggest 
that Zainab will have very little to offer detectives when she 
eventually gives an official witness statement.

‘She was beaten around the face with 
great force, and then shot in the shoulder – the trauma was immense,’ 
said the source. ‘She’s already indicated that she remembers very little
 about any of it.’

Investigators are focusing on three specific areas – Mr Al-Hilli’s work, his family and his native Iraq.

The ‘Iraq connection’ has been the 
subject of intense speculation and Mr Maillaud said a ‘specialised’ team
 was examining Mr Al-Hilli’s links to the country.

He also said there could be a ‘great number of clues’ in Britain.

As the only witnesses to the bloodbath, the girls would be an obvious target for those responsible for carrying it out.

Discussing the attack in general 
terms, another detective said: ‘Police quickly demonstrated that the 
victims did not correspond to the profiles of "normal tourists" and they
 were not assassinated in normal conditions.’

Referring to the gun used, the source 
introduced the possibility of state security groups being involved, 
saying: 'A 7.65mm is definitely an old-fashioned calibre but it can 
still be used by some special forces.'

Zainab's statement will take place 
inside her hospital room on camera, according to a source at the CNEF 
police centre at Gif-sur-Yvette, near Paris, where the officers 
preparing to speak to her have been trained.

‘There will be no direct questions,' 
added the source. 'Everything will be left open-ended and general. This 
means trying to stimulate the memory of a little girl whose life has 
been shattered.

‘Pictures will be shown of the family 
BMW at the murder scene. This is one of the only ways that Zainab can be
 taken back to last Wednesday and the horrific events which unfolded.’

The French officers will be 
accompanied by a translator and social workers, although there is 
currently no indication that an Al-Hilli family member will be with 
Zainab.

Security remains extremely tight 
around the Grenoble University Hospital, where Zainab is guarded by 
around 12 police at all times.

The victims' family said they were 
'heartbroken' by the 'shocking crime', adding they were 'touched by the 
expressions of sympathy from people all over the world'.

Meanwhile Ahmed Al-Saffar, the brother in law of Mrs Al-Allaf, described his family's heartache at the massacre.

'The victim's family and I are 
heartbroken by this shocking crime and we have been touched by the 
expressions of sympathy from people all over the world.

'The victim's family are of 
Iraqi-Arabic origin. We are very grateful for the support provided by 
the British, French and Iraqi authorities during this difficult time.

'We hope that those responsible for the deaths of our loved ones are brought swiftly to justice.'
