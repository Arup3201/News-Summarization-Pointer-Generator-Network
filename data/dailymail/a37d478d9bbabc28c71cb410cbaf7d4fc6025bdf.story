A woman who has been married eight times has appeared on This Morning to discuss her colourful love life - and to make an impassioned plea to find husband number nine.

Sandra McNab has had eight weddings over a 39 year period - all of which have ended in divorce. Now says she just wants to find Mr Right.

'He's out there looking for me now,' she jokes.

Asked if she is a hopeless romantic, Sandra, from Clydebank, near Glasgow says revealingly that she just sees the good in everyone.

'I see the good in everyone': Sandra McNab attempts to explain why she has had so many husbands as she appears on the This Morning sofa with Eamonn Holmes and Ruth Langsford

'Of course in the past I've asked myself, is it me or is it them?' she confesses. 'When it was younger, it might have been me. I was boisterous, rebellious.

'But the truth is, I wear my heart on my sleeve. I had no idea there were bad people out there - and I learned the hard way.'

Sandra is frequently dubbed Scotland's answer to Liz Taylor by locals and in the Press - something she says she used to find very difficult.

'At first that was upsetting,' she says. 'Until my brother turned around and said, "she was voted the most beautiful woman in the world" Then I thought, come on, it's not so bad,' Sandra says. 

Suggesting that Sandra must be a 'magnet' to men, Eamonn Holmes, interviewing Sandra alongside his wife Ruth Langsford, asks whether she would be satisfied simply dating these men, instead of marrying each one she meets.

Happy childhood: Sandra says the strong marriages of her parents and grandparents fuel her own desire for a happy ending

'You sound like my mother,' she says. 'She used to say, "Sandra, you can date them, you can bed them - it doesn't mean you've got to wed them!"

Sandra says her parents' and grandparents' happy marriages fuelled her passion for romance - and that the paradigm they set laid the foundations for her need to marry.

'I was married for the first time at 16,' she says. 'You look at your parents, and they're happy.

'To me, marriage meant happiness. Granny and Grandpa: happy.

'But then looking back, I realise at 16 that was a bit ridiculous.

'Then as time went on, it was morals and scruples. We've all got our own.' 

Sandra says characteristics her ideal man would possess are honesty and trust. 'And he shouldn't look at my outside,' she says. 'There is a heart and soul inside.

'I wouldn’t look at me twice without make up. You have to look at people’s heart, not their outside. 

Incredibly, Sandra says her string of failed marriages has not put her off men for life.

'Two out of three ain't bad!' Eamonn Holmes jokes that Sandra's good looks and good sense of humour stand in her favour - but she laughs that the fact she is broke doesn't help her appeal

'I'm very aware of not becoming a very bitter person,' she says. 'I 
know I'm not going to get my 25 years, my big special party. 

'I can barely get to paper!'

Are potential suitors put off to find that Sandra has been married eight times already?

'I guess the mind's not completely closed.

'I was assaulted in my last relationship. I was down. I spent three years in bed. I thought never, never again.

'But that's sad. To think you'll never get that happy ending.

‘I’m an incurable romantic,' she says. 'But now I want a man who will look after me for a change.

'I'm fed up being the one who does the looking after.

'I’ve always been the kind of "mummy"', she says. 

Does she think she needs counselling? ''If I went to a psychiatrist, my psychiatrist would go and see a psychiatrist",' she jokes. 'I’m not normal. People don't see the world in the way I do. Nobody knows how to deal with me.'

Told that she is a good looking woman, Sandra laughs. 'Flattery will get you everywhere,' she says - before pointing out that unfortunately her assets end there.

'I’m totally skint – broke!' she says.
