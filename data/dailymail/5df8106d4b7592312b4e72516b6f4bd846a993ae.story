Greece's government was in crisis last night after a breathtaking decision to close down the country’s equivalent of the BBC.

The conservative-led coalition appeared in danger of collapse – an outcome that could send Greece crashing out of the euro – after sending in police to end transmissions by the state-run broadcaster.

Television and radio signals from the Hellenic Broadcasting Corp, or ERT, went dead early yesterday, hours after the government closed the corporation and fired its 2,700 workers, citing the need to cut ‘incredible waste’.

The International Monetary Fund, European Union and European Central Bank had demanded that 2,000 public sector jobs be cut within months as the price of Greece’s bailout and place in the single currency.

The Greek government said it planned to launch a new, slimmed-down broadcaster.

Thousands of protesters gathered 
outside the company's headquarters north of Athens as journalists defied
the order and continued a live Internet broadcast.

Nonetheless, government spokesman Simos Kedikoglou - a former state TV journalist - described ERT as a 'haven of waste' and TV and radio signals went dead early today.

'ERT is a typical example of unique lack of transparency and incredible waste. And that ends today,' Kedikoglou said.

'It costs three to seven times as much
as other TV stations and four to six times the personnel - for a very 
small viewership, about half that of an average private station.' 

He said its 2,500 employees will be compensated and the company will reopen 'as soon as possible' with a smaller workforce.

Yesterday's announcement did not make immediately clear how long that would take.

Employees of ERT kept on reporting live into the early morning at the television station's headquarters after the government announced its closure

It
is the first case of mass public sector layoffs in the recession-mired 
country, which has pledged to cut 15,000 state jobs by 2015 as part of 
its bailout commitments.

Debt-stifled Greece has depended on rescue loans from its European partners and the International Monetary Fund since May 2010.

In exchange, it imposed deeply resented 
income cuts and tax hikes, which exacerbated a crippling recession and 
forced tens of thousands of businesses to close, sending unemployment to
a record of 27 percent.

The so-called 'troika' of the European 
Union, European Central Bank and International Monetary Fund has been 
pressing the government to start a long-delayed program to fire civil 
servants.

Kedikoglou insisted the government had 'no need' to inform the troika officials of its decision.

The European Commission said it had 
not sought the closure of ERT but 'nor does the Commission question the 
Greek government's mandate to manage the public sector.'

Greece's POESY media union accused the government of sacrificing the broadcaster to appease its creditors.

Yesterday afternoon the minister responsible for the media, Simos Kedikoglou, announced the deeply unpopular decision to immediately shut down the public television and radio broadcaster

After the announcement, thousands rushed to the main ERT headquarters in a northern Athens suburb to show their support for the broadcaster

'Bailout
creditors are demanding civil service layoffs and the government, in 
order to meet its obligations toward foreign monitors, is prepared to 
sacrifice the public broadcasting corporation,' a union statement said.

Unions
representing ERT workers at three terrestrial TV stations, one 
satellite station and its national and regional radio network said they 
would keep the stations on the air.

Protesting
employees gathered at the company headquarters in the Athens suburb of 
Aghia Paraskevi, together with opposition lawmakers and union leaders, 
to oppose the move.

Now Greece's two largest labor unions 
called a 24-hour general strike on Thursday to protest the government's 
decision that has shocked the public and triggered a political crisis.

The civil servants' union ADEDY said it had called a strike and a series of protests to be held outside the ERT headquarters.

The larger GSEE union was also meeting to ratify the decision and join the nationwide strike, officials from that union said.

Journalist unions also launched rolling 24-hour strikes, halting private television news programs.

The shock announcement widened cracks in
the year-old conservative-led governing coalition, with both minority 
partners condemning the suspension of ERT.

A government spokesman said the 2,500 employees will be compensated and the company will reopen 'as soon as possible' with a smaller workforce.

Conservative Prime Minister Antonis Samaras faces stern opposition from his own coalition partners - the Socialist Pasok and Democratic Left party - for the decision.

Left-wing opposition leader Alexis Tsipras slammed the closure as 'illegal' during an interview on ERT's online broadcast.

'Many times the word 'coup' is used as an exaggeration,' he said. 'In this case, it is not an exaggeration.'

Tsipras said he would meet the 
country's president later Wednesday and ask him to cancel an executive 
order he signed allowing the government to close ERT.

The decision to close ERT was announced during an inspection in Athens by officials from Greece's bailout creditors.

The executive order to close ERT must be ratified by parliament within three months but cannot be approved without backing from the minority coalition lawmakers.

The surprise closure of ERT is now one of the biggest crises to afflict the three-party coalition government since it was formed nearly a year ago.

Despite tensions over a number of issues, notably related to the austerity measures demanded by Greece's international creditors, the coalition government has surprised many by surviving.

It has also been credited with stabilizing the bailed out Greek economy and easing the threat of an exit from the euro.

ERT started radio programming in the 1930s and television in the mid-1096s.

Though it was widely regarded as reflecting government positions - it had a channel run by the military during the 1967-74 dictatorship - the broadcaster was also valued for showcasing regional and cultural content and for covering major sporting events such as the football World Cup and the Olympics.

The BBC is one of the the largest broadcasters in the world by number of employees.

The total average headcount of the BBC's service was 16,858 for the year ending 2011/12.

Its work is primarily funded by a licence fee, which is paid by households, businesses and organisations who receive its live broadcasts.

Last year the licence fee was £145.50 - this equated to £3,606m licence-fee funded services.

This funded 10 UK-wide TV channels, national and regional TV services across the UK, 10 UK-wide radio networks, two national radio services each in Scotland, Wales and Northern Ireland, 40 local radio stations in England and the BBC Online.

In contrast, Greece's ERT employs around 2,700 people for its television and radio broadcasters.

Around 88 per cent of ERT's funding comes from television licence fees.

ERT operates two television networks with national coverage, one nationwide television network, two regional television stations, one worldwide satellite channel, and three digital channels. 

The company operates 19 regional radio stations, two worldwide radio stations, six national radio stations and three ERT-3 radio stations - two with local and one with worldwide coverage. 

It produces four musical ensembles and publishes Radiotileorasi, a weekly radio and television magazine.
