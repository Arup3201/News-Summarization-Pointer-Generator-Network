Three Kings Yard mews, near Claridges in Mayfair, has a long and fascinating history.

During the 1930s, one of houses in Three Kings Yard mews was turned into the Chancery of the Italian Embassy.

In the run-up to the Second World War, Dino Grandi, a Fascist Minister and a huge supporter of Benito Mussolini, was appointed as Italian ambassador to London.

Sir Oswald Mosley, founder of the British Blackshirts which later became known as the British Union of Fascists, was a regular visitor during this time.

But the Blackshirts' visits outraged residents in Mayfair, and the gates would regularly be closed after being besieged by protesters and members of the press.

Despite its chequered past, the mews' luxury homes have become highly sought after by London based business people, families and overseas purchasers wanting a London pied-a-terre in the very centre of the capital.

The home, two doors down from where the Italian ambassador lived and spread over three floors, has now been put on the market with Wetherell Estates for £4.25 million.

Founder of the British Union of Fascists, Sir Oswald Mosley

Before he founded the British Union 
of Fascists, BUF, Sir Oswald Ernald Mosley was the MP for Harrow from 1918 to
 1924 being elected for the Conservatives before becoming independent 
and then joining the Labour Party.

He served as Chancellor of the Duchy of Lancaster in Ramsay Macdonald's Labour administration.

He
 resigned from the government in protest at their unemployment policies,
 which he had tried to reform but found himself blocked by the party 
hierarchy.

He formed the 
New Party which amalgamated with the BUF in 1932. Mosley allied himself with Nazi Germany.

In October 1936, Mosley and 
his supporters decided to march through Cable Street in the East End, 
the home of a thriving Jewish community, to celebrate the fourth 
anniversary of the founding of the party.

By 
1pm on the day, around 2,000 of Mosley's Blackshirts had gathered around Cable 
Street while around 500 Jews and anti-fascists congregated at Gardiner's
 Corner.

They ran to Cable Street where they armed themselves with sticks and formed a
 barricade by overturning a lorry. At 3.30pm, Cable Street was the scene
 of some of the worse street fighting seen in England and Mosley's 
Bentley drove into Dock Street where it was pelted with bricks.

Mosley's supporters began chanting his name while the anti-fascists 
retaliated with the Internationale. Mosley then gave a Hitler salute and
 was advised by the police to drive back through the City of London 
rather than press ahead.

Mosley gave a brief speech in which he accused 
the government of surrendering to 'red violence and Jewish corruption'. 
At 4pm, the remaining fascists dispersed allowing the local to claim 
victory.

Mosley, father of ex-Formula One boss Max, was interned in 1940 and the BUF proscribed. He was 
released in 1943, and, politically disillusioned in Britain, he moved 
abroad in 1951, spending most of the remainder of his life in France. He died in 1980.
