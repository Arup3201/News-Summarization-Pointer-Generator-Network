The Ku Klux Klan is trying to attract listeners to their racist radio station by using messages of love and pictures of puppies.

A billboard erected in Harrison, north Arkansas carries the innocent-sounding  'It is not racist to love your people', but the true sentiment of the message becomes clear by website it advertises. 

Underneath the picture of a young girl holding a puppy, is the address of web-based Ku Klux Klan radio station White Pride. 

Not so cute after all: The billboard showing an innocent-looking girls and cute puppy carrying a message of love is in fact advertising Ku Klux Klan station White Pride Radio

The website advertised on the billboard automatically redirects  to  KKKRadio, whose program listing includes 'This is The Klan,' ''The White Side,' and 'White Women's Perspective.'

The billboard has been rented by the Knights Party of Zinc, formerly the Knights of the Ku Klux Klan, and comes just a year after another billboard carrying a racist message was taken down.

'Yes, that's us,' Thom Robb, national director of the Knights Party admitted to the Harrison Daily Times, adding that he has paid for the billboard to be up for one year.

Robb was national director of the Knights of the Ku Klux Klan, which The Southern Poverty Law Center said he has renamed the Knights Party. 

Robb said that he has been working on the web-based radio station for more than a year and wanted to advertise it.

Race riots a century ago chased all but one black person from Harrison, according to the Encyclopedia of Arkansas, and in the 1980s the Knights of the Ku Klux Klan moved its headquarters there.

Another billboard in Harrison that read 'Anti-Racist is a Code Word for Anti-White' was taken down in 2013 after being in place for just more than a year.

 A second billboard beneath it read: 'Welcome to Harrison. Beautiful town. Beautiful people. No wrong exits. No bad neighborhoods,' also was taken down.

The person or groups who leased those spaces were not identified.

Mayor Jeff Crockett and Chamber of Commerce President Patty Methvin, who expressed dismay at the billboards in 2013, could not be reached for comment Wednesday.

The city has formed a race-relations task force that has been trying to change the city's image.
