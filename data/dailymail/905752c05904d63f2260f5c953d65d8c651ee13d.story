When Katie Hnida started classes at the University of Colorado in 1999, she envisaged that her experience would be centered on the football field as the first female kicker for the Buffaloes.

But in 2000 while she was hanging out with a teammate in his appearance, she claims that he raped her.

The talented athlete revealed her story four years later but the attack was never proven.

Instead of people coming to her support, she was branded a liar and had every inch of her livelihood criticized including her sexual history  - even though she was a virgin. 

Now 33 years old, she claims that the Rolling Stone article about 'Jackie' has done a 'huge disservice' to rape victims and that there is a 'major problem' on college campuses.

Katie Hnida claims a male teammate on the University of Colorado football team raped her while they hung out in his apartment in 2000 

Even though she became the first female player to score in a NCAA Division I-A game, she has been traumatized by the events of the alleged attack

After realizing that the suspected attacker may not face justice, she described how she feared for her safety on campus, as her accused was still out there, and struggled to sleep in the aftermath.

Her coach allegedly told her she was a terrible kicker and the scrutiny led to her transferring to the University of New Mexico. There should would become the first female player to score in a NCAA Division I-A game.

Since the attack almost 15 years ago some of the after effects have warn off, but Miss Hnida says there is still a stigma that follows her around.  

She told Tina Griego of the Washington Post: 'To this day, people call me a liar.

'Sometimes I wish they could be there when I get so nauseous and sick that I'm throwing up and nights I can't sleep and when I got into a depressive funk.

'Those times are rare now – it does get better, I want people to know that — but they are still around because it never truly goes away. It changes you.'

'I didn't expect such disregard for my life. I was a virgin when this happened and incredibly naive. I thought coming forward would force the university to acknowledge it had problems and make changes. Instead, it exploded. 

'There is a definite fear for your safety knowing that someone who is capable of doing something as horrible as raping you is still out there. 

She said the idea of one of her former teammates being falsely accused  would kill her. However she says that fabricated accounts are rare, but the impact is harrowing.

She revealed her story in 2004 and was met with intense scrutiny and criticism. Her accused never went to jail, but since she has spoken to people all over the country about preventing violence 

'The attention you get as a rape victim is not fun, it's awful.'

Miss Hnida went to the district attorney a short time after the alleged attack took place. She did not report it straight away, but insists it is rare for women to react so quickly by telling the authorities. 

She said the hardest thing to hear was the warning that her suspected rapist would probably never be jailed.

Almost 15 years on from the incident, Miss Hnida is now doing speeches about her experiences and she works with numerous organizations dedicated to preventing violence against women.

She said the magazine had a responsibility to 'her [Jackie] and to the public to make sure they were presenting a story that had been thoroughly researched and vetted and their failure to do that did a huge disservice to all rape victims.

'I can tell you we don't have a giant problem with women lying about rape in our society. We do have a major problem with women being raped, especially on college campuses.
