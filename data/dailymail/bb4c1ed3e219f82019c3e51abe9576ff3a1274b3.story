Apple users are finding the long-awaited iOS 8 update likes to jump the gun when it comes to shooting selfies.

The company released the update to the mobile operating system last week with an overhauled Messages app that many were simply not ready for.

A reporter for TechCrunch was led astray by what she thought was a shortcut for taking a carefully posed selfie to send over iMessage.

Accidents: Holding down and flicking the camera button will immediately send out a selfie, instead of giving users a chance to edit

Holding down a button on the left side of the screen brought up two menu buttons, one for video and one to take a photo.

Clicking on the photo button, it turns out, snaps a photo and sends it out immediately without the option of editing it.

So with no time to get the lighting right or edit the photo just so, you could become a victim of the accidental selfie. 

The new iOS update has already faced criticism. 

Co-founder and CEO of messaging app WhatsApp snarked 'very flattering to see Apple "borrow" numerous WhatsApp features into iMessage in iOS 8 #innovation' on Twitter back in June.

Rash: Frustrated users took to social media to share their dissatisfaction and their awkward selfies caused by a poor rollout of the new Messages app

The Verge pointed out that trying to 'own' all conversations on a single device was a losing prospect, when products like WhatsApp could be used across platforms.

It seems likely that Apple will roll out a fix for the accidental selfie issue, but until their iOS is ready for selfies, users will just have to be selfie-ready at all times.
