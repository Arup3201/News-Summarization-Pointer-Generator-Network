A pair of hungry egrets have taken the meaning of food fight to a whole new level after devouring a fish in mid-air.

The hungry birds were photographed pecking each other after one of them caught a fish in Hungary, and the other decided to try and steal it.

This funny fight was captured by Belgian psychologist Marc Costermans, 49, after he noticed the clash taking place at the Kiskunsagi National Park, Hungary.

Photographer Marc Costermans captured the images despite the tussle only lasting ten seconds

'This winter most of the lake was frozen over, with only a little spot left for birds to catch fish,' says Marc, of Walhain, Belgium.

'Therefore the grey heron, great white egrets and the cormorants all had to come to the exact same spot if they wanted to get dinner.

'This caused a lot of fights between the birds, and at the moment I captured these images one bird had managed to catch a fish.

A lake in the park had been frozen over all winter, with the exception of one spot where the birds were fishing

With so many birds competing for food in such as small space, Marc says there were regular food fights

'Only he quickly had to then fight off all the other hungry birds who wanted to steal it from him for themselves.'

Spending several hours at the national park, Marc captured the quick ten second fight between the birds from just a few meters away.

Marc says: 'I've got a great response from my pictures with people thinking it's a funny series.

Marc says he hopes the photographs will cause people to look more closely at the birds around them

'I want to show the beauty of nature through my photography.

'The best feedback I had received was from somebody who said to me that after seeing my photographs they now really look at the birds around them.

'I think this is the first step to positive things, because after seeing how beautiful nature can be people are more aware and are likely to respect it and preserve it.'
