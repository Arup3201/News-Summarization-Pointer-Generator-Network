Booking a ticket online to head to a sports match is normally a simple process as you fly through the forms.

Putting in your details is a bit of an arduous process but most of us are normally happy to be called either Mr, Mrs or Miss.

However, as first reported in Charles Sale's Sports Agenda column, the online registration form at Lord's this summer offers an extensive list of 52 titles to ensure fans can choose the appropriate title for their tickets to catch this summer's Ashes series, with the second Test against Australia hosted at the Home of Cricket.

They say they want to make all members of society feel welcome – though the majority of the list comprises aristocratic and religious titles and military ranks. Not to mention Queen, for the most important guest of all.

Other titles on offer include: Brigadier, Brother, Captain, Commander, Princess, Don, Father, Judge, Lord, Mademoiselle, Reverend, and Wing Commander.

However, the list is by no means comprehensive, including earls and viscounts but not dukes. The military ranks also exclude admirals or generals.

A spokesman for Lord’s said: ‘We have within our membership a complete cross-section of society, including the Queen who is a patron.

‘The membership committee took the decision that they wanted all members to be able to title themselves correctly.’

Usually ticket applications for sports events and concerts allow buyers to choose from just three titles – Mr, Mrs or Ms. 

But cricket fans entering the ballot to see the England internationals against Australia and also Test matches against New Zealand are free to select any title they wish...which is expected to encourage a few of the more mischievous members of the public to adopt titles that don’t belong to them.

Others who might find the extensive list of titles useful are former cricket Baroness Heyhoe Flint (left), and former Prime Minister Sir John Major (right) , a well-known fan of the sport

On the rare occasions that royalty attend Test matches – the Queen visited the Lord’s match against Australia in 2013 – it is unlikely they would opt to sit among the masses.

The Queen, and other VIPs, would be seated in the pavilion and would not, of course, be required to buy tickets. The ballot for the Ashes Test with Australia, which starts on July 16, and a Test against New Zealand in May closed at one minute to midnight last night.

The cricket ground, in North London, uses the ballot system as a fair way of allocating tickets for matches which are often oversubscribed, because it gives all applicants an equal opportunity.

Lord’s was established in 1814 and is widely regarded as the Home of Cricket.
