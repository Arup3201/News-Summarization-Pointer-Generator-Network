Merlin – one of the most popular shows on TV – is coming to PC, bringing with him the wondrous fantasy world fans know and love.

Thankfully, BAFTA-winning Bossa studios are behind the project, and have developed a game that places a strong emphasis on cooperative, pick-up-and-play gameplay.

Pretty: The visuals stay true to the series but have a cartoon-like feel about them

Merlin: The Game is free to play on Facebook, and combines authentic style with striking visuals.

Players can embark on a magical adventure with friends to battle against the evil forces that threaten Camelot. 

We talked to Creator in Chief, Imre Jele, on what fans can expect from the game:

Take us through Merlin.

Imre: 'We wanted to create a fantasy game for quite some time and it made sense to work with a very good like brand like Merlin.

'We asked ourselves how we can make a game that is an authentic extension of the show and not an exploitation of the brand.

'The show is about three things: heroism, fighting off evil creatures and comradery, this being the relationship between Arthur and Merlin, or Arthur and Gwen. 

Have you brought characters over from the universe itself, or have you created your own characters?

Imre: 'Both, we call it Season A. It takes place in the same universe at Season 5 and therefore you’re going to meet all those characters.

'You get quests from Merlin, Arthur and Giaus and interact with them throughout the game.'

Adventure for all: The game is free and can be played at any time on Facebook

What made you want to make this game free to play?

Imre: 'We decided a game based on this IP has to meaningfully expand upon it and it cannot be just exploitation.

'The reason we decide to go for a model where you don’t pay upfront is firstly because we believe the game is good enough to be able to work as a freemium model and secondly because everyone and anyone who wants to try it can play the game.

'That’s why the game is on Facebook - we wanted to make sure we opened up this game to as many people as we can.

'The visuals speak for themselves, this quite a unique looking game, not something you’re going to find on the market. You’re not going to find any other game on the platform like this.'

Character customisation is a huge part of this. How have you managed to tailor that kind of freedom without it jarring the game universe?

Imre: 'Because we wanted to make an accessible game we decided we won’t have classes, so it’s not like traditional games where you choose your class and you’re stuck with it.

'I didn’t want anyone to feel they can’t change their mind and be penalised for their starting choice.'

Work together: You can work through the adventures with any of your friends

Tell us about cooperative play.

Imre: 'We wanted to combine the good elements of a role-playing game but at the same time is simple enough so somebody who’s new can instantly pick-up the game. We’ve made a very intuitive control system.'

What about the game’s soundtrack?

Imre: 'All of our sound effects and music from the game are made by the same people who the music and the soundtrack of the TV show.

'So, the music is based on what you’ve heard on the TV show and the sound effects, too. When you hear two swords clashing together in the game it’s actually the same one as the show.'

Any plans for mobile gaming?

Imre: 'Not at this point, the first release of the game will be on Facebook only but we are considering a touch version.'
