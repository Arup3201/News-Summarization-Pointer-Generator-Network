Paul O’Connell fears Australia might be a step ahead of Ireland heading into Saturday's Guinness Series finale due to their greater consistency in selection.

Ireland, who are gunning for a first November clean sweep since 2006, field a side containing 13 of the team that started in the win a fortnight ago over South Africa.

However, the skipper is concerned that last Sunday’s wholesale changes — just two players who started against the Boks were retained to start against Georgia — could give Australia an edge.

O'Connell said that Ireland coach Joe Schmidt has set out a mantra which is easy to execute

‘I like playing week on week,’ said O’Connell. ‘Some guys, maybe the power athletes, like having a week off between games, but I like playing week on week.

‘It’s down to personal choice but, for me, I’d rather be in the position that the Australians are in.

‘They have rested one or two guys (after last weekend’s loss to France), but by and large have a continuity of selection, they’re playing really high intensity games week on week.’

O’Connell also quashed speculation linking him to a possible post-World Cup switch to Pau.

‘I don’t know anything about it,’ he said.

‘There has been nothing done on my behalf or nothing done on Pau’s behalf anyway.

‘I’m contracted until the summer of 2016, so I just don’t know where it (the story) came from.’
