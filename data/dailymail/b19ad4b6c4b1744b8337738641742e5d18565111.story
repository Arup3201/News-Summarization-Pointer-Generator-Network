Shot through the eye by an arrow, he died at the hands of four Norman knights brutally dismembering his body - or so almost 950 years of history dictates. 

But archaeologists are now claiming King Harold may have survived the Battle of Hastings, and lived out his years before quietly dying of old age. 

The alternative version of events, put forward in a 12th century document housed in the British Museum, discounts the Normans' portrayal of his death in the Bayeux Tapestry. 

According to the Bayeux Tapestry, King Harold was killed by four Norman knights after being shot through the eye with an arrow at the Battle of Hastings in 1066 (pictured)

The artwork, long considered an accurate depiction of the 1066 Battle of Hastings, shows King Harold clutching at an arrow in his eye as four Norman knights hack at his body.

But now a team of historians, who discovered the remains of Richard III in a municipal car park in Leicester in 2012,  are eager to dispel the long-accepted story. 

Oval Film and Stratascan, whose efforts were applauded around the world for the discovery, will carry out an underground scan of Abbey Gardens at Waltham Abbey Church in Essex, the supposed site of King Harold's tomb, to look for his remains.

'We have the Norman story put through the Bayeux Tapestry – the English story is a different one,' said Peter Burke, a historian in Waltham Abbey. 

'You put things together and it begins to build a picture that is quite solid. If everything backs you up in history, you should look at it.  

'You shouldn't just leave it,' the 64-year-old told the Independent. 

'I am convinced Harold survived the Battle of Hastings.

'If we find the complete remains of an old man in his late 70's with scarring to his temple from a battle wound then we need to do a DNA test.

'Our understanding of this particular period of English history would have to change.'

Fronting £2,000 for the project, Mr Burke will oversee a scan of the church's grounds on Tuesday roughly 15 yards from his alleged tomb at the High Altar. 

If anything is picked up by the scan, English Heritage will have to apply to the Secretary of State for permission to excavate the site. 

However members of the Waltham Abbey Historical Society think it is unlikely they will find anything of interest as the site has been disturbed by building works over the years. 

The remains of Richard III were found in a car park in Leicester in 2012. 

It was the site of the lost Grey Friars church where the royal had been buried following his death in the Battle of Bosworth Field.
