A former gang member blew kisses to his friends and family members and declared 'I'm at peace' before he was  put to death Tuesday evening for the fatal shootings of three rivals 14 years ago in San Antonio.

Miguel Paredes, 32, was convicted along with two other men in the September 2000 slayings of three people with ties to the Mexican Mafia. 

The victims' bodies were rolled up in a carpet, driven about 50 miles southwest, dumped and set on fire. 

A farmer investigating a grass fire found the remains.

Miguel Paredes, 32, is seen here in a jail house interview earlier this month. The former gang member was executed Wednesday night for the murder of three people

As Paredes entered the execution chamber, he blew kisses to his supporters. 

'To the victim's family, I want you to know that I hope you let go of all the hate because of my actions,' he said.

'The lion came here as a lamb.'

Paredes was pronounced dead at 6.54pm CDT, 22 minutes after being injected with a lethal dose of the sedative pentobarbital. 

The execution was delayed slightly to ensure the IV lines were functioning properly, said Department of Criminal Justice spokesman Jason Clark. 

The procedure calls for two working lines.

Normally needles are placed in the crease of an inmate's arms near the elbows, but in Paredes' case, prison officials inserted IV lines into his hands. 

As the drugs began taking effect, he took several deep breaths while praying. He started to snore and eventually stopped.

The execution was carried out after the US Supreme Court turned down a last-day appeal from attorneys who contended Paredes was mentally impaired and his previous lawyers were deficient for not investigating his mental history.

His was the 10th lethal injection this year in Texas, the nation's most active death-penalty state. 

One other Texas inmate is set to die in December and at least nine are scheduled for execution in early 2015, including four in January.

Prosecutors said Paredes was the most aggressive shooter when Nelly Bravo and Shawn Michael Cain, both 23, and Adrian Torres, 27, showed up to collect drug money at the home of John Anthony Saenz, a leader in Paredes' gang.

Defense attorneys argued that Paredes, who turned 18 six weeks before the slayings, grew up in a neighborhood where the only way to survive was to join a gang.

No friends or relatives of the victims attended Paredes' execution. Cain's family said in a statement afterward that Cain was 'no longer with us for no other reason than being in the wrong place at the wrong time.'

'Our family has waited 14 years for justice to finally be served,' the statement said.

Paperwork carrying Saenz's name was found in the debris with the victims' bodies and helped police solve the case. Saenz, 32, claimed self-defense and avoided the death penalty when jurors sentenced him to life. 

The third man convicted in the killings, Greg Alvarado, 35, pleaded guilty and also is serving life in prison.
