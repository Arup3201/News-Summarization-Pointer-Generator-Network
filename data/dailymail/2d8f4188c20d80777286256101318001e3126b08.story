Cycling fanatics will be able to take their hobby to the water with a specially designed water bike.

Cycling fanatics will be able to take their hobby to the water with a specially designed water bike.  The Schiller X1 bike (shown) reaches speeds of approximately eight knots - the equivalent of 9.2 miles (14.8 km) per hour on land, while inflatable pontoons either side stop it from sinking and keep it stable

The human powered vehicle weighs just 20.5kg (45lb) thanks to its sleek aluminium frame.

- Hard anodized, powder coated aluminum frame.

- Stainless steel and aircraft grade aluminum materials. 

- Carbon Drive belt system. 

- Integrated steering on handlebars.

- Twin oscillating propellers for rudderless steering.

- Rugged, dual chamber inflatable pontoons.

- Performance saddle, handlebars, cranks and pedals.

Watertight storage compartment for valuables

Twin oscillating propellers which move left and right eliminate the need for a rudder while the inflatable pontoons keep the rider afloat. 

And the bike can also go in reverse while on the water.

California-based sports company Schiller also says the water bike can be assembled or taken down within just ten minutes - and it is small enough to fit into a car boot.

'The idea was born out a love for biking and water sports,' said founder and CEO Judah Schiller.

'With approximately one billion bikes built for land on a planet that is over two thirds water, the time had come for a revolution in cycling and water sports.'

The human powered vehicle weighs just 20.5 kilograms (45 pounds) thanks to its sleek aluminium frame. Twin oscillating propellers which move left and right eliminate the need for a rudder while the inflatable pontoons ensure maximum rider safety. And the bike can also go in reverse while on the water. 

The chainless bikes are driven by a Carbon Drive belt system (shown). They are not detachable from the main trusses of the boat. Californian based sports company Schiller also says the water bike can be assembled or taken down within just ten minutes - and it is small enough to fit into a car boot

He continued: 'Our goal was to create a water bike that would give the rider a sense of exhilaration and freedom as they set out for a morning ride or a weekend of camping or a day out fishing.

'It's lighter than a kayak, more stable than a stand up paddleboard and frees the rider of having to use a paddle for propulsion.

'And unlike almost any other water craft, the Schiller X1 also easily fits in the closet of an urban dwellers apartment and in the trunk of most automobiles.

'It's a bike designed for sport, fun and leisure - there is a relationship between the rider and the bike that is perhaps even more pronounced on water than on land.

'It is your vessel that keeps you afloat out on the blue and yet a bike - an awesome, precision engineered one - just the same.'

The Schiller X1 comes in a variety of colours with LED lighting and interchangeable bike components including the saddle, handlebars and pedals.

It is available from the Schiller website and costs about £3,900 ($6,495).

But for those with extra money to spend, Schiller are offering 250 special editions of the bike - called the 'Founders Edition'.

For a staggering £5,270 ($8,775) the water bike will come with an engraving, a wet dipped mirror chrome painted frame and a technology guarantee.
