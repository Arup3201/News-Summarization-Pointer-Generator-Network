Having put on a show at the World Cup, Germany's players were determined to do the same when they arrived back home on Tuesday.

Around half-a-million fans flocked to Brandenburg Gate in the country's capital to greet the new world champions, who had a surprise in store for the gathering crowds.

As the players gathered on a massive stage - after an open-top bus parade through the streets of Berlin - Thomas Muller, Mats Hummels, Erik Durm and Christoph Kramer looked to be striding out on to the podium alone.

Unknown to the jubilant fans, however, captain Philipp Lahm was behind them.

Muller, Hummels, Durm and Kramer stopped and then fell to the ground to reveal Lahm holding the shimmering World Cup aloft. The players then further entertained the crowds by playing air guitar.

The routine certainly went down with the gathered crowds, who roared in delight. Later Arsenal defender Per Mertesacker led some of his team-mates in another dance routine as Joachim Low's side enjoyed themselves.

Germany had earlier arrived home at 10am local time and were greeted at the airport by excited fans trying to get a glimpse of the World Cup trophy as they made their way through the terminal.

During their 11-hour flight it was reported in German newspaper Bild that the Germany players managed to get some rest. After partying on Monday to celebrate their fourth World Cup triumph, there was a reported hour delay after a baggage carrier had touched the plane.

Arsenal midfielder Mesut Ozil was delighted to touch down on home turf, and said on his Twitter account: 'back in the country of the world champions.'

Thousands of supporters lined the Fan Mile in the centre of Berlin as the team, who were all dressed in identical winners T-shirts, took to an open-top truck to parade the World Cup trophy.

On the 
side of the black Mercedes truck was painted the years of Germany's 
triumphs at the biggest tournament in world football, '1954, 1974, 1990,
 2014!'
