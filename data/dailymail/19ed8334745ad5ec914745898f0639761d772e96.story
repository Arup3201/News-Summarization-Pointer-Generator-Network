A millionaire golf course owner was stabbed to death during a drunken row with a handyman on his dream retirement estate in the Dordogne, a court heard today.

Peter Fuller, 67, had moved to the unspoilt area of south west France following a distinguished but stressful career with the Total Oil company.

But three years ago he became involved in an argument with Neil Ludlam, a 33-year-old friend from England who was helping out with DIY work on Mr Fuller’s five bedroom house.

Today Perigueux Criminal Court was told that Ludlam had only been working on the estate for three weeks when the fight started.

Ludlam,who faces 30 years in prison if convicted of murder, admitted a violent row following a heavy drinking session, but said he could not member much about it.

Peter Fuller died after becoming involved in an argument with handyman Neil Ludlam. He was found at his five bedroom home in the Dordogne area of France by his ex-wife

However, an autopsy report showed that Fuller died from a stab wound to the chest, with a knife puncturing his right lung.

Some details of the attack, which took place on June 26, 2009, were recalled by Ludlam, who said: ‘We argued in the kitchen. Fuller fell down and hurt his head. He said he had a gun and wouldn't hesitate to use it.’

Mr Fuller, who was originally from Chatham in Kent, had been in the tiny village of Plaisance – which means Pleasure - near Bergerac, for more than six years.

He created the Mirandes Golf and Country Club nearby, designing its 18-hole course himself.

It was meant to remind the many British expats in the area of home, serving fish and chips, and bangers and mash in its restaurant.

Ludlam was living alone in a caravan in the grounds of Mr Fuller’s house, and carried out maintenance including gardening.

Mr Fuller's ex-wife, Wilhemina Jans, said she had found him lying face down in a pool of blood on June 27, 2009 – the day after his death.

She saw signs of a violent struggle everywhere, including blood on the kitchen walls and floors. Broken glasses and furniture also lay everywhere.

Two of Mr Fuller's cars had been stolen, although one was later found crashed nearby.

A police investigation found blood on two knives owned by Ludlam, and there were also traces in his caravan and on his clothes.

Ludlam was described as ‘acting suspiciously’ by locals in the days after the murder, and he returned to Britain.

But British police arrested him as he stepped off a flight at Luton airport from Bordeaux, and he was extradited to France a month later.

Ludlam said the fight had started when the pair started exchanging childish family insults about each other.

His defence barrister, Philippe de Caunes, said: ‘While he doesn't remember everything, he regrets his act and is still at a loss as to how he could have done such a thing given that he considered the victim his friend.’

Some 20,000 British expats live in the Dordogne. It is hugely popular because its countryside resembles the best of the UK's, but it enjoys a warm, summer climate for most of the year. Low property prices also make it very attractive to retired people.

The case continues.
