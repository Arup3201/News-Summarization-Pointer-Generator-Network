Military police were required to intervene when almost 1,800 pensioners gridlocked traffic and besieged a doctors' surgery during a vaccination day.

Traffic became gridlocked and tempers flared as the Creffield Medical Centre, in Colchester, Essex, held its annual vaccination day.

Military police stepped in to control traffic as hordes of pensioners caused the nearby roads to become completely jammed.

David Wilkin, 63, was dropping someone off for their appointment when he got caught up in the chaos for nearly an hour.

David Wilkin said the area was 'bedlam' when hundreds of pensioners swarmed on the local medical centre during its annual vaccination day

The problems were caused by cars parking on both sides of the road, including on double yellow lines.

Passing Royal Military Police officers spotted the chaos and stopped to direct traffic.

Mr Wilkin said: 'It was absolute bedlam.

'People were just abandoning their vehicles to make their appointments.

'There were an awful lot of people getting very irritated.'

He called for stricter traffic control in the area.

Ann Read, practice manager at the medical centre, said she apologised to anyone who was inconvenienced by the congestion and will be reviewing its plans next year.

She said: 'We try very hard to ensure we maximise the opportunity to get people vaccinated as early as we can before winter.

'We have found designating a specific day ensures we get maximum coverage for our patients, and invite patients to attend at 15 minutes intervals to try to maintain a steady flow.

'We also secured offsite parking for the staff and had two car park attendants working for most of the day.

'We did not observe the problems in the surrounding roads but anecdotal evidence suggested it was mainly in the hour before lunch, which coincided with when the heavy rain stopped.'

The medical centre raised more than £2,000 for charity during its flu day.

A spokesman for the North Essex Parking Partnership advised businesses or organisations who anticipate parking problems to let them know in advance so they can send traffic wardens.
