The owner of a trendy Manhattan cafe is being sued for discrimination after he claimed that 'people with big butts don't work fast.'

Joshua Berkowitz is accused of making the comment to his employee Michael Douglas Jnr, after Mr Douglas employed Noho cafe's first black waitress. 

According to documents lodged at Manhattan Supreme Court Mr Berkowitz made several racial slurs to Mr Douglas, who was employed to manage the venue.

Court documents claims that Mr Berkowitz asked who 'the new dark girl was'. 

Later Mr Berkowitz is alleged to have said: 'My father warned me about hiring people like that, people with big butts. Do you understand what I mean? People with big butts don't work fast.' 

Mr Douglas' case claims that he is part black and part Asian. 

Later Mr Berkowitz is alleged to have said: 'You have some black in you and you're Spanish/Filipino. I'm sorry that's really f***** up. If I married a non-Jewish woman, my parents would sit shivah.' (A Jewish ritual of mourning the dead). 

A week later, Mr Berkowitz is claimed to have said: 'With all due respect to your background... large bottoms don't move fast, large bottoms don't work hard. 

'Do you agree? I mean, aren't the Irish all drunks? Aren't Russians all thieves. I love saying the most f***** up s***.' 

According to the court documents, which were seen by the New York Post, Mr Douglas resigned because he did not want o hear the constant racial stereotypes.  

According to court documents lodged at Manhattan District Court, pictured, Mr Douglas is seeking unspecified damages after his employer Joshua Berkowitz made racial comments in his presence
