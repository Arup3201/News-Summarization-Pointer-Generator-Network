Isaak Wolfe, an 18-year-old high school senior living in York, Pennsylvania, has been denied the right to graduate with his male name, and instead will be identified as Sierra Stambaugh, his birth name.

The school board is allowing Wolfe to wear the boy's black graduation gown, but won't be able to go by Isaak Wolfe, since it's not his legal name. Board solicitor Ben Pratt toldÂ WHTM that since the diploma is a legal document, the recipient's legal name must be on it.

Molly Tack-Hooper, an American Civil Liberties Union lawyer, told the Associated Press that Wolfe is in the process of changing his name but hasn't had time to complete the process.

Hard times at Red Lion High: Isaak Wolfe is fighting with the school's administrators to go by his male name at graduation

Wolfe has been living as a male for three years now, after realizing that she was different and not 'like the other kids,' Wolfe told the York Daily News.

She finally realized the answer to her isolation: 'It was that I identified as a male.'

So in his junior year, he changed his name to Isaak Wolfe from Sierra Stambaugh - with the full support of his parents.

Wolfe says that though he faced some skepticism at school at first, for the most part, everyone has started calling him Isaak.

Support: Friends and community members wore stickers that read 'His name is Isaak' at a recent school board meeting where Isaak argued against going by his female name at graduation

It was in the final stretch of his senior year that the school's administration began giving him a hard time for his gender identity.

Wolfe told his girlfriend Taylor Thomas earlier in the year that he wanted to run for prom king. After he submitted his application he found out - without warning - that his name had been entered as Sierra Stambaugh on the prom queen side of the ballots.

'For a transgendered person, it is degrading to have that, and I wasn't even warned.'

According to Wolfe's father, WIlliam Stambaugh, the school's principal 'said the king was always a male and the queen was always a female. And he feels that's the way it should be.'

The school even threatened to ban Thomas, a 2011 Red Lion graduate, from attending the Prom as Wolfe's date after she started an online petition criticizing the principal for not allowing Wolfe to be addressed by his male name at graduation.

The principal, Mark Shue, described the language in Thomas's petition as 'dangerous.'

Shue continued to pressure Wolfe to stop Thomas' campaign and release a scripted press statement, until Wolfe finally called the ACLU. The organization is now representing Wolfe.

'Isaak is accepted by his family, teachers, and peers for who he is,' said Reggie Shuford, executive director of the ACLU of Pennsylvania. 'He had no reason to expect to be treated differently by school officials, and Shue's efforts to silence Isaak and Taylor and suppress their First Amendment rights are completely inappropriate and unconstitutional.'

That's not my name: The school board is unlikely to budge on using Isaak's female name. According to a board member, the diploma is a legal document and Isaak is not yet his legal name
