A koala is dressed in a Hawaiian shirt as part of a wacky art project combining animals and the world of fashion.

Elsewhere, a wolf beams in a dinner suit and a bull poses in a figure-hugging bomber jacket.

The dapper beasts are the creation of Spanish artist and photographer Yago Partal, 31, whose work has achieved a cult following online.

Dressed to impress: A koala wears a Hawaiian shirt and an owl a yellow coat  in the art project by Yago Partal

Dapper: This ring-tailed lemur and ostrich are smartly dressed in a scarf and bowler in the composite images

Human looking: A llama is dressed in a simple brown coat, while a macaque is put in a grey suit

Elderly gents: This hare and the raccoon have been made to look like pensioners in their shirts and vests

Acceptance: The artist is surprised by the reaction his pictures, such as this horse and red panda, have got

Mr Partal, from Barcelona, said the project had been inspired by childhood stories of wildlife, cartoons and fashion.

The artist admitted that he has been pleasantly surprised by the reaction to the collection of animal mugshots. 

'I am very surprised by the acceptance of
this photographic series,' said Mr Partal, who also works as a 
conceptual designer for films by acclaimed directors like Pedro 
Almodovar and J.A. Bayona.

'I guess a frontal portrait of an animal wearing fashionable clothes and
directly looking at the viewer seems to generate some curiosity in 
people.'

He said it had been conceived with no other pretensions than 'to have fun and set his work apart'.

Artist: Spaniard Yago Portal said the project 'seems to generate some curiosity in people'

Super cool: A pug is given a hip-hop makeover and a wolf is dressed in a dinner jacket and bow tie

Collection: The Zoo Projects artwork that features an otter and a mink is half photograph, half illustration

Layered look: As if he were not furry enough this panda and polar bear have been given scarves

Looking good: The red squirrel and giraffe are some of the only animals to be dressed in women's clothes

Characters: The bear looks even more cuddly in a woolly jumper but the bull looks mean in the puffer jacket

The work, which is half photograph and half illustration, is still developing and he continues to produce more animals.

These include a giraffe wearing a roll-neck jumper, an ostrich with a bowler hat and a fox dressed like a TV detective.

So far his most cherished character is the macaque dressed in a suit and
tie because of the colours and that primates 'look almost as if brushed
with humanity'.

But he added: 'My favourite is yet to come - the moose, my favourite animal.'

Suited and booted: The sloth looks like it is ready for a night on the town, while the dog seems to need a nap

Dressed down: The tiger and the pig have gone for the casual look in simple shirts

Mug shot: The lemur and fox look like they could be posing as gangsters in their smart outfits

Bizarre: The frog is dressed in a jumper and a rhino wears a leather biker jacket
