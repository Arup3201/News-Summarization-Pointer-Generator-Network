A university professor has 'confessed' to killing his ex-girlfriend and her mother and daubing 'Free Pussy Riot' above their bodies in an effort to mislead police, detectives claim.

Russian police arrested 38-year-old Igor Danilevsky after the 76-year-old mother and 38-year-old daughter were found dead in their apartment in Kazan, western Russia, last week.

The slogan was scrawled in English on the wall above their bodies, which had multiple stab wounds, according to investigators.

Danilevsky apparently stabbed 
the younger victim after a disagreement over a planned trip between the 
two, and killed her mother when she rushed into the room to help.

The professor, who works at a Kazan university, wrote the slogan and stole the 
victims' money and mobile phones to make it appear that someone else 
committed the crime, authorities said.

Police said Danilevsky was a former classmate of the daughter and had been stringing her along after she agreed to him help pay off his debts by borrowing hundreds of thousands of roubles (tens of thousands of pounds) from banks.

The suspect, who lives with his parents, allegedly said he had promised to marry the 38-year-old and to take her on holiday.

He then grabbed a knife and killed her during a quarrel after he told her the trip was off, he is said to have told the police.

After murdering her mother too, he disfigured both women's face and bodies with the knife, before writing on the wall 'to draw suspicion away from himself and portray it as a ritual killing', the regional Interior Ministry said.

He took the knife used in the 
killings with him, along with almost £2,000 of the mother and daughter's
 money and two mobile phones.

He was detained after the phones and 
the knife were found on the balcony of his parents' apartment, where he 
was hiding from creditors, according to police.

Police made it clear that the crime 
had not been committed by a Pussy Riot supporter and was not inspired by
 the group's protest against President Vladimir Putin in February near 
the altar of Moscow's Christ the Saviour Cathedral.

The murder probe began a fortnight after female punk band members Maria Alekhina, Yekaterina Samutsevich, and Nadezhda Tolokonnikova were jailed for two years for hooliganism.

An investigator had earlier cautioned that the killer was possibly trying to mislead police by drawing attention to supporters of the punk protesters.

Police did not provide the women’s names and did not reveal details about their occupations or whether they had any connection to the band.

The news came after fresh criticism of the group by a Russian Orthodox Church official on Thursday.

Kristina Potupchik, a pro-Putin blogger 
and former spokeswoman for a militant youth group known for its violent 
pranks against opposition and Kremlin critics, said in a post that the 
killer would 'not get away' with the killing and compared them
 to mass murderer Charles Manson, who also used the blood of his victims
 to write on the walls of their houses.

The jailed band members’ attorney Nikolai Polozov said on Twitter that 'what happened in Kazan is horrible' and said he was 'sorry that some freaks are using Pussy Riot’s band name'.

Their case has 
polarised Russians. Kremlin-friendly television networks and media 
covered the 'punk prayer' in mostly negative terms, and the country’s 
dominant Orthodox Church called their stunt sacrilegious.

But hundreds 
of artists, musicians and other intellectuals have signed petitions 
urging authorities to free the band members.

The leader of an Orthodox youth group 
that has accosted and assaulted Pussy Riot supporters claimed they were 
capable of committing 'any' crime.

'The infernal force that drives them hates God, believers and humankind in general,' Dmitry Tsorionov told Interfax. 'These people are capable of committing any crime, and nothing but force and law can stop them.'

The country's dominant Orthodox Church has called the band's stunt sacrilegious but hundreds of artists, musicians and other intellectuals have signed petitions urging authorities to free them.

Several wooden crosses that stood outside Orthodox churches in Russia and neighbouring Ukraine have been toppled by people who claimed to be the band’s supporters. The band’s manager and husband of one of the jailed rockers said the band disapproved of the vandalism.

The trial, widely seen as Kremlin-orchestrated, caused an international furore. Celebrities such as Paul McCartney and Peter Gabriel urged Russian authorities to free the band.

A poll by the state-run VTsIOM polling agency showed that one third of Russians consider their two-year jail sentence too harsh, while another 31 per cent found it appropriate.
