Google Maps may be a good tool for locating crime, discovered a recovering addict who looked up an area in New Jersey where he used to buy drugs and found what he believes is a drug deal in action.

Reddit user wowurdumb found what appears to be a shady transaction when we checked on the Camden, New Jersey neighborhood where he used to buy heroin.

The Google Maps Street View shot shows two men conversing through a chain link fence and exchanging an unknown object for money, reports The New York Post.

Dope spot: The Google Street View of an area in Camden New Jersey where a recovered addict used to buy his drugs shows an apparent drug deal

'So Iâ€™ve been clean for a while and I decided to look at the old dope spot on Google maps,' he wrote.

'Was not disappointed or surprised.'

Wowurdumb went on to explain that the spot he looked up was where he would buy both heroin and crack and was one of four or five spots he frequented in the Camden neighborhood.

Wowurdumb is now clean, and he's attributed his sober lifestyle to those around him who support him and also to the study of Buddhism.

He says he was a suburban kid who went from 'weed to percs to dope' and that drug addiction could happen to anyone.

He says he was clean at the time that the photo was taken and that the area seems to have changed a bit.

'I was clean already by the time this was taken. The house actually looks different than it used to. When I used to go there the gate was open and the windows weren't boarded up yet,' he said.

'You used to have to get nodded in by someone watching the gate who would chirp to the guys in the back that you were coming.

There was a small porch with an open window like you were walking up to a drive through and you'd place your order, hand over the money and be on your way.'

The Mail Online tried contacting the Camden Police Department to see if police launched an investigation in the area once the photo was made public but no one was available for comment.
