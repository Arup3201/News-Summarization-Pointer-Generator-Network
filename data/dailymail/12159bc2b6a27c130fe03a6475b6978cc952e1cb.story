More than a dozen women and children have been killed in a graveyard in Afghansitan while paying their respects to dead relatives.

A bomb exploded today in the cemetery in a rural district of Nangarhar province, in the east of the country.

14 people were killed in the attack, which appeared to be timed to coincide with the festival of Eid ul-Fitr, marking the end of Ramadan.

Attack: This boy was wounded by a bomb in a graveyard in Nangarhar which killed 14 people

It is an Afghan tradition to visit the graves of ancestors during Eid to have a picnic and honour the dead.

The victims of the Nangarhar graveyard bomb were mostly from a single family, according to a spokesman for the provincial governor.

In addition to the 14 dead, a child and three women were injured.

Nangarhar and its capital, Jalalabad, have been racked by a series of bombings and suicide attacks over the last week.

Elsewhere, three Afghan bodyguards for the Helmand province police chief, Mohammad Hakim Angaar, were killed on Wednesday in a suicide bombing.

In June, a suicide bomber rammed an explosives-laden car into the former Helmand police chief's convoy, wounding three.

Western forces have been desperately trying to improve the security situation before they pull out of Afghanistan next year.

However, continued attacks by the Taliban and incidents of Afghan soldiers turning against their Nato handlers have put that deadline in question.
