Patrice Evra has revealed that Louis van Gaal wanted him to be Manchester United captain had he stayed at the club.

The France international ended an illustrious career at Old Trafford after agreeing a move to Serie A champions Juventus on a two-year contract for an undisclosed fee.

The 33-year-old made a total 379 appearances for United and claims that new manager Van Gaal was keen to extend that stay.

Red leader: Patrie Evra claims that Louis van Gaal wanted to hand him the Manchester United captaincy

'Manchester United wanted to keep me and they also wanted to give me the captain's band,' he reportedly said to Sky Sports.

'Van Gaal was disappointed to see me go away, but I had already made a choice.'

Evra admits it was difficult to leave Manchester United, especially after then Juventus manager Antonio Conte resigned before his arrival.

'It was really difficult to leave Man United, but I did it. I made my choice and I am really happy with my choice.'

'I
 was really surprised when Antono Conte left. I was wondering why a coach
 who strongly wanted me would have left but in the end everyone is the 
owner of his own destiny. I a not angry with Conte but I am happy that
 I am with Juventus - a great club with a great history.'

Evra also urged his knew club to pursue their reported interest in Portugal winger Nani.

'He is a great player and it was a privilege for me to play with Nani. If Juve are interested in him, I can only say that Nani would be a great purchase.'

And, the defender has admitted he is keen on playing alongside his former Manchester United 
team-mate Carlos Tevez once again.

The striker joined Juve from Manchester City last summer and scored 19 goals during his first season with the Bianconeri.

'Carlos is
a warrior,' said Evra. 'It was tough for me to see him leave United 
for another team. We're great friends on and off the pitch.

Evra may not have been part of the Juve 
side that clinched three Serie A titles between 2012 and 2014, yet after
making the 'tough' decision to swap England for Italy, he intends to 
play a key role in another successful defence.

The
 Frenchman said: 'It won't be easy to win four titles in a row. I 
managed to do it three times with Manchester United and know how 
difficult the challenge is.

'We also hope to do well in the Champions League. It's a great competition and we'll look to go as far as we can.'
