Alan Irvine is considering asking Ian Wright to give Saido Berahino one-on-one coaching to ensure his finishing gets even better.

The West Bromwich Albion head coach played alongside Wright at Crystal Palace in the late 80s and can see similarities in Berahino.

Wright went on to score nine times in 33 England games and for a period was Arsenal’s recorded scorer with 185 goals.

Berahino, 21, is now tipped to win his first England cap soon after having taken his Premier League tally this season to six with a fine goal against Manchester United last Monday.

Irvine said: ‘I played with Ian at Crystal Palace and Wrighty had that energy and enthusiasm and wanted to run in behind people. Saido needs to keep on doing that.

‘Ian became better as he went on, he was one who stayed behind at the end of training and practised.

‘I have spoken to Saido and said that Ian and I have chatted about him. If I feel Saido could do with a little bit of extra help, I might well (ask Wright to help out). I would be frightened what he might do with him! 

'Saido has got great potential and at 21 Ian was raw. But he had real potential, what he did was kept on working at his game.

‘That’s where Saido could be, a top striker. But he needs to maintain this approach he has got at this moment.

‘The big danger would be if he gets distracted by anything else that goes on, or if he just loses that little bit of focus.’
