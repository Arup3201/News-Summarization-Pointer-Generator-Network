Three gang members faced jail today after being found guilty of possessing a sub-machine gun and its ammunition, which was found stashed near a children's playground.

The 
Sterling 9mm weapon, which fires 500 rounds a minute, and a 
balaclava, were discovered on the Pembury Estate in 
east London by a Hackney Gangs Unit.

Snaresbrook Crown Court heard the police officers 
were cycling past the play park, an area known as a hang-out for the 
Pembury Boys gang, when there was a commotion and around ten men dispersed.

The weapon: The Sterling Parabellum 9mm sub-machine gun was found on the Pembury Estate in east London by a Hackney Gangs Unit

The suspicious officers searched the area and found the weapon wrapped in a plastic bag.

Not far from the scene, they found bullets, a kitchen knife and a balaclava, also in a plastic bag. 

Fingerprints belonging to the defendants were found on the bags.

Tyrell Goather, 21,and Helal Miah, 
17, were sentenced to a combined eight years in prison, while Philip 
Johnson, 18, was given a 12-month youth rehabilitation order at 
Snaresbrook Crown Court for possession.

They are all believed to be ‘younger’ members of the notorious Pembury Boys gang, whose turf war with the rival London Fields Gang was the inspiration for Channel 4 drama Top Boy about East London gangs.

Goather was also key witness in the murder trial of Shaquille Smith, who was stabbed as he sat in a park near London Fields in 2008. 

Jailing the defendants, Judge Wendy Joseph said: ‘There have been many incidents in London in recent years when young people have been killed or maimed and innocent bystanders caught in the crossfire.

Philip Johnson was given a 12-month youth rehabilitation order

‘This was a British Army issue sub-machine gun capable of being fired repeatedly. It was in a children's playground on  a heavily populated estate. It was near to live ammunition that could be fired from it.

‘It is obvious that a gun to be used to threaten only does not require ammunition.’

A hat and bike belonging to Miah were dumped near to the weapon.

The gun was linked to two non-fatal shootings in south London in 2009 after undergoing police testing.

Both Miah and Goather denied the charges and gave alternative explanations as to why their DNA was found on the weapon and bullets, but their accounts were rejected by a jury. 

Johnson, who is homeless after his gang activity put his family in danger, admitted looking after the bullets for ‘around half an hour’ while he was staying with a friend.

Describing the offence as one of ‘significant gravity’ Judge Joseph said: ‘I know it is not easy to grow up on such an estate where there are others encouraging people to join activities that are not legal. 

‘But yours is a story of why no young person should join a gang.’

Sentencing Goather, whose testimony jailed the murderers of his friend Shaquille, she added: ‘You of all people should have known better than to associate himself with those who obtain weapons.’

Goather was convicted of possession of an offensive weapon and possession of ammunition and sentenced to five years in prison.

Miah, who can be named after the judge lifted reporting restrictions, was convicted of the same offences and sentenced to three years in prison.

Johnson, who admitted possession of ammunition, was found not guilty of possession of an offensive weapon and was given a 12-month youth rehabilitation order due to the six months he had served in custody on remand.

Detectives from the borough’s Operation Bantam gun crime unit later linked the weapon to the three through DNA evidence and analysis of phones.

Police believe they were left in charge of the weapon for the ‘older’ members of the Pembury gang.
