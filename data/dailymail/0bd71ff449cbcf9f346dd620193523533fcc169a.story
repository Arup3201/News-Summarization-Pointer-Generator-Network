Royal Bank of Scotland will create an internal 'bad bank' to swallow £38billion of toxic loans and avoid being broken-up permanently, it was announced today.

The ailing bank, which is 81 per cent owned by the taxpayer, says the decision would allow its 'good' parts to improve quicker as it was also forced to announce a sharp fall in profits this morning.

Operating profits fell to £438million for the third quarter of 2013, down from £909million 12 months earlier, causing its share price to drop by 13p to £3.53 when the stock market opened this morning.

The results are the first presented by RBS’s new boss, Ross McEwan, after he replaced Stephen Hester at the start of September.

Changes: The Royal Bank of Scotland has today announced that it will not be split in two, instead creating an internal £38bn 'bad bank'

The decision not not to fully split it into ‘good’ and ‘bad’ banks has been led by the Chancellor.

George Osborne had been under pressure to do so to ensure the 'good' section to be privatised quickly.

RBS's new focus will see it being a 'boost to the British economy instead of a burden', he said today.

The bank has now been ordered to run-down its 
problem loans via an internal company – mostly related to commercial property and the troubled 
Irish business Ulster Bank.

Bosses believes this will be simpler and help the bank recover quicker from is financial problems.

Chief executive Ross McEwan has also started a full review of the lender which will report back in February, and is to speed up the sale of its Citizens US banking subsidiary, with a partial flotation next year.

Mr McEwan said the plan will 'create a bank that can reward the faith of UK taxpayers and all our investors'.

Bad news: New RBS chief executive Ross McEwan, who took over from Stephen Hester in September, announced a £500m drop in profits today - and said there would be further losses this year as they cope with toxic debt

RBS will make a substantial loss overall this year as the faster run-down of assets in the internal bad bank will cause an accounting write-down of up to £4.5billion.

Loss: With the share price still £1.50 each below what the Government paid, RBS will be publicly owned for some time, George Osborne said today

And when including one-off items and an additional charge of £250 million to cover redress for the mis-selling of payment protection insurance (PPI), RBS made a bottom-line loss of £634 million in today's third quarter results.

City experts also believe a full-blown 
break up would have been a bad idea.

Ian Gordon, an analyst at Investec,
said: ‘I don’t know a single shareholder who thinks a break up is a 
good idea.’ He also warned that RBS faces a mounting compensation bill 
for mis-selling insurance alongside loans to small businesses.

When the bank was bailed-out in 2008 the taxpayer paid £5 per share. The current price is around £3.53.

Mr Osborne said he thought it was 'unlikely' that RBS could be sold off and returned to the private sector before the next general election in 2015.

'I think, sadly, it is still some way off,' he told BBC Radio 4's Today programme.

'I think, quite frankly, it is unlikely before the general election.

'If there was a transformation in RBS and all these problems that it has to confront were dealt with much more quickly, maybe we would reconsider. But I say 'unlikely' in the real sense of the word, which is I don't think it's very likely.'
