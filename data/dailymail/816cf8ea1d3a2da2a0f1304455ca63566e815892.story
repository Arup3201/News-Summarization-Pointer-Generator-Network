The Queen is famous for her love of horses and so are Zara Phillips and Princess Anne. But it seems they aren't the only royals with a passion for all things equine.

Sophie Wessex, a keen rider in her own right, was among the racing aficionados to turn out for the first race of the day at Newmarket - and even had a runner.

Unfortunately for the royal, her horse, Zilber, failed to make the grade and could only manage a third place finish in the Alex Scott Maiden Stakes, well behind the winner, Provident Spirit.

Despite the disappointing result, the Countess appeared on good form as she enjoyed the sunshine and a chat with co-owner, the Countess of Derby, and Zilber's jockey Adam Kirby.

The day out at the races is a break from what has been a very busy schedule for the Earl and Countess of Wessex, with more engagements to follow next week.

Next week will see the royal couple tour Gloucestershire, with visits to the Clearwell Caves and Three Choirs Vineyard in Newent pencilled in.

The following day, the couple are scheduled to visit a number of historic churches in Oxfordshire, before the Countess continues on alone to a local packaging factory.

Passion for horses: Although not as committed as the Queen, Sophie Wessex is also a horsewoman

For now, and with the Easter break to look forward to, the Countess appeared relaxed and happy as she watched the races in the bright Suffolk sunshine.

And although she didn't quite manage to take home the trophy, she did at least fare better than the Queen, who last week saw her filly Enliven trot into a lowly seventh place in the Coln Valley Stud Bridget Maiden Fillies Stakes at Newbury.

The monarch couldn't conceal a grimace as she watched her horse, who had been introduced to President Higgins of Ireland the day before, slope across the finish line.

The Queen's career as a racehorse owner spans more than 60 years and began with the handful she inherited on the death of her father George VI.

Like her father and grandfather before her, the Queen's horses race in purple and scarlet silks enlivened with gold braiding.

During her long association with racing, the Queen has triumphed in more than 1600 races and has won every one of the British Classics, with the exception of the Epsom Derby.

Last year, Estimate, a filly owned by the Queen, romped home to take the prestigious Gold Cup at Royal Ascot - much to the delight of the monarch.

While Sophie Wessex regularly appears in the carriage alongside the Queen at Royal Ascot, she, unlike her mother-in-law, is yet to win a race there.
