Two schoolchildren have been suspended for a year for firing airsoft guns at fellow pupils, prompting anger from their parents who believe the punishment was too severe.

Aidan Clark and Khalid Caraballo were among six children involved in an airsoft war in Khalid's parents' front yard when their pellets hit pupils at a nearby school bus stop.

The two boys, both 13, and another boy involved who cannot be named, were suspended for a year on Tuesday after a disciplinary hearing where it was claimed the plastic pellets were of sufficient force to cause welts on students who were struck.

Aidan Clark and Khalid Caraballo (pictured) were suspended for a year on Tuesday after a disciplinary hearing into them firing airsoft guns at Khalid's mother's home in Virginia.

The school made it clear that its investigation found that the children were running in the street, near to the school bus stop, allowing it to claim jurisdiction.

But Khalid's mother Solangel Caraballo said the boys were firing the pellet guns on private property and should never have been disciplined by the school system.

'My son is my private property,' she told WAVY.com. 'He does not become the school's property until he goes to the bus stop, gets on the bus, and goes to school.'

And Khalid insisted that all the shots were fired on his parents' property. 'It's unfair because we were in our yard,' he said. 'I didn't have anything at school at anytime'.

He said all the witnesses for the school's investigation against him were at one point involved in the airsoft war or had visited him on his private property that day.

Khalid's two friends, including Aidan, admitted leaving the front yard and chasing each other but insist that Khalid never left his property and that neither of them fired their airsoft pistols in the street.

And now Khalid's parents have accused the school of bullying their son after an official released the boy's disciplinary record on Twitter.

Virginia Beach School Board Chairman Daniel Edwards tweeted: 'We can share that this is not Khalid Caraballo's first disciplinary infraction.

'He has been disciplined six times in less than 18 months for increasingly aggressive behavior including harassment, bullying and fighting that resulted in injuries.'

Eileen Cox, a spokesman for the 
68,000-student Virginia Beach, Virginia, school system, said it has 
responsibility for students' safety to and from school.

Matthew Delaney, principal of Larkspur Middle School, said in a written statement that he hoped the suspended students would learn that 'there will be consequences when they do things that can result in harm to another person.'

Khalid has been placed in an alternative school while Aidan's parents have made arrangements to home school their son until a hearing in January decides whether they can be readmitted to regular classes.

With the suspension on his school record, Khalid admited he is worried about his future.

'It's terrible. I won't get the chance to go to a good college,' he told WAVY.com.Â 

'It's on your school record. The school said I had possession of a firearm. They aren't going to ask me any questions. They are going to think it was a real gun, and I was trying to hurt someone.'

The school system's Facebook page has been filled with comments for and against the suspensions, with some questioning whether students on private property should be punished by the schools.
