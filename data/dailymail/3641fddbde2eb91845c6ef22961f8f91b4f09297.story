One of the most prolific serial killers in LA's history, who is already on death row for killing ten women in the Eighties and Nineties, was convicted of four more murders yesterday.

Chester Turner, 47, was found guilty of strangling the women in South Los Angeles between 1987 and 1997. Prosecutors said DNA evidence linked him to the killings.

Jurors deliberated less than a day before finding the former Domino's pizza deliveryman guilty of first-degree murder with special allegations that make him eligible for the death penalty again, according to a statement from the Los Angeles County district attorney's office.

Chester Turner, 47, dubbed one of LA's most prolific serial killers by prosecutors, has been found guilty of four more murders. He is already on death row, convicted of ten other killings in the Eighties and Nineties

Turner (pictured in a police mugshot and during his first trial) was one of at least three serial killers who murdered women in Los Angeles in the 1980s and 1990s - dubbed the Southside Slayings

Turner had already been convicted and sentenced to death in 2007 for killing 10 women, including one who was six months pregnant.

Turner was jailed for ten years to life for the murder of the unborn baby, known as 'Baby Washington' after his mother, Regina Washington.

Authorities say Turner was one of at least three serial killers who stalked the Los Angeles-area during a crack cocaine epidemic in the 1980s and 1990s that led some women into prostitution to support their drug habits.

The attacks were dubbed the 'Southside Slayer' killings before authorities concluded more than one attacker was involved.

Turner moved to LA when he was five years old with his mother after his parents separated.

He dropped out of high school, then moved into homeless missions as a young man when his mother moved back to Utah.

During that time he attacked women, usually raping them before strangling them to death. He was jailed seven times between 1995 and 2002, mostly for minor crimes.

His connection to the murders was only established after he was jailed for raping a woman in 2002 and was forced to give a DNA sample, which was matched to other samples taken from his victims.

During the investigation officers began to look at other similar cases in the area where Turner was operating, and reopened the case of homeless drug addict David Allen Jones.

Jones was convicted of three murders, but DNA evidence linked Turner to two of them. Police cannot prove, but strongly suspect, that Turner is also responsible for the third.

Following the revelations, Jones was released from jail having served 11 years behind bars, and sued the state for $720,000.

Two years ago, Michael Hughes was sentenced to death for strangling a 15-year-old girl and two women. He previously got life for four more killings.

Former mechanic Lonnie Franklin Jr. has pleaded not guilty to 10 so-called 'Grim Sleeper' killings and the attempted murder of another woman that took place between 1985 and 2007.

The victims were strangled or shot and dumped in alleys near his South Los Angeles home.
