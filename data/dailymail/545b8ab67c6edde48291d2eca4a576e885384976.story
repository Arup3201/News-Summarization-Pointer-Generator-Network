Staff at a Kansas zoo were unable to save the life of a self-harming gazelle.

Addra gazelle Raul ran toward a gate and smashed his head multiple times at the Topeka Zoo on Monday, the Topeka-Capital Journal reported.

The self-bashing broke Raul's neck, the paper said, and the gazelle was killed.

'We're not really sure what 
happened,' Zoo Director Brendan Wiley told MailOnline. 'A visitor saw it
 [around 2pm] and told us that the gazelle started to run to opposite ends of its 
enclosure and charged at its gate three times.'

'The
 other gazelle [in the exhibit] was completely undisturbed,' Wiley said, and 'was oblivious to what the other gazelle was doing.'

The director of Topeka Zoo, Brendan Wiley, said he thought the gazelle may have been 'spooked'

Another gazelle in the exhibit paid no mind to Raul's death, Wiley said

'We asked the visitor that was here "Did you see anything? Did you hear anything?" and the answer was no.'

'We were a little curious - it sounds as if something spooked this gazelle,' Wiley told MailOnline.

'We looked at the animal for signs of snake bites or [signs of a sting] - there wasn't anything,' he said.

The necropsy, he said, showed nothing strange apart from Raul's broken neck. Results from tissue examples should come between 10 and 14 days, he said.

Wiley said gazelles like Raul are at risk in their native Africa because of hunting and lack of conservation money.

It's the second rare gazelle to die at the Topeka Zoo, where a 3-year-old Addra died of a sudden illness in December 2012.

The International Union for Conservation of Nature says 'the total population [of Addra gazelles] certainly numbers well less than 500 individuals.'
