Lewis Bojang, 37, says staff in shops and restaurants are all ready to give him the VIP treatment - until they realise there are no paparazzi or bodyguards.

He is a dead ringer for Will.i.am, and is frequently mistaken for the hip hop Black Eyed Peas star.

Lewis, a dispatch controller, is the same height as the Black Eyed Peas musician and The Voice judge and their birth dates are just days apart.

'I am always getting noticed, and in the street I can often hear people saying I look like Will.i.am,'said Lewis, who moved to Tottington, Bury, Greater Manchester, five years ago from The Gambia.

'People in shops, restaurants clubs and bars have asked me to have a picture taken with them.'

It was his wife Karen, 38, an office manager, who first spotted the resemblance as the couple watched The Voice.

'I looked at Will.i.am on the television and then looked across at Lewis and something suddenly clicked,' she said.

Lewis's wife Karen Bevins noticed the likeness while the couple were watching an episode of The Voice

'I can’t believe we didn’t notice it sooner but we never really followed Will.i.am or were interested in his music.

'For about a year now people have commented wherever we go and give Lewis a second look and even the VIP treatment.

'People do double takes or ask if he is related and his friends even call him Will now.

'We’ve had shop staff scurrying round and holding open doors for us before they realise there are no paparazzi or bodyguards.'

The couple are to attend the live show of The Voice this summer and hope to meet Will.i.am backstage.'

'I have always dressed similar to Will.i.am’s style anyway but now I have I started buying more similar clothes,' said Lewis.

'It is hard to find the same styles though, because he wears handmade designer garments.'

Lewis has now signed up to lookalike agency Fake Faces and has been told he could earn between £100 and £400 an hour.

He is also set to take acting classes to help him perfect Will.i.am’s mannerisms and American accent.

'Because Will.i.am is in the UK and on
our screens a lot at the moment it has definitely emphasised how much 
my husband looks like him, or maybe the other way around!' said Karen.

'Lewis can’t sing or rap though, so maybe it’s there the resemblance ends.

'Then again Will.i.am has admitted he isn’t the best singer either so maybe Lewis is his perfect doppelganger.'
