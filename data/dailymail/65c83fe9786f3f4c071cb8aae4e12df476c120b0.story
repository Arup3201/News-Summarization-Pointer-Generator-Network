Two Crown Prosecution Service staff face criminal fraud charges over an alleged £1million fraud involving bogus taxis for witnesses.

Finance manager Lisa Burrows, 41, and another unnamed worker, face conspiracy to commit fraud charges over allegations concerning false claims for witness taxi services that were never supplied.

Both work for CPS West Midlands.

Malcolm McHaffie, deputy head of special crime for the CPS, said: ‘Following a complaint by the Crown Prosecution Service and a subsequent investigation by West Midlands Police into two members of CPS staff, I have carefully considered available evidence in relation to Lisa Joanne Burrows, a finance manager, and another member of staff, an administrative officer. Both are employed by CPS West Midlands.

‘I have now concluded that it is appropriate to charge both Burrows and the other individual with conspiracy to commit fraud.

‘The charges relate to an allegation that Burrows and the other member of staff, on or before 27 February 2013, conspired together to commit fraud by false representation by submitting to the Crown Prosecution Service false claims for witness care taxi services to the value of at least £1,000,000 when no such services had been supplied. This is contrary to s1 of the Criminal Law Act 1977.

‘This decision was taken under the Threshold Test of the Code for Crown Prosecutors. I have tonight authorised West Midlands Police to charge these two individuals, and Lisa Burrows has now been charged. The other individual has not yet been charged.'

Lisa Burrows will appear at Birmingham Magistrates Court on February 28.

Sorry we are unable to accept comments for legal reasons.
