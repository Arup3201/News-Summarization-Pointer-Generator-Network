Zara Phillips' new baby girl has been given a less than regal title by her rugby-mad dad Mike Tindall: 'Shed Head'.

The couple became proud parents of baby girl Mia Grace who was born at Gloucestershire Royal Hospital last Friday.

Their first child is 16th in line to the throne and the Queen's fourth great-grandchild.

Ex-England rugby star Tindall has said she will also be a lifelong supporter of his beloved Gloucester rugby club, whose fans are nicknamed 'Shed Heads' after a stand at their Kingsholm home ground.

The North Stand - which houses 3,000 die-hard fans without seating - is known as 'The Shed' because it resembles a giant cow shed.

He told local paper the Gloucestershire Echo: 'There's another Gloucester supporter for life - she's a Shed Head.'

Describing his daughter's first week, Tindall added: 'It's been alright actually - not going to Perpignan (to play in the Heineken Cup last Saturday) made things a bit easier.

'It's been a good week with the new arrival and it was topped off with a brilliant result from the boys.

'It's been fun so far. At the moment she's been very good and the nights haven't been too bad.'

Zara and Tindall first met in a Sydney bar when he was in Australia for the 2003 Rugby World Cup.

They married in July 2011 in Edinburgh at a ceremony attended by the Queen and senior royals.

They moved back to Anne's Gatcombe Park estate last January after selling their regency home in Cheltenham.

Zara won an equestrian silver medal at the London 2012 Olympics and is planning to take part in the Rio de Janeiro Games in 2016.
