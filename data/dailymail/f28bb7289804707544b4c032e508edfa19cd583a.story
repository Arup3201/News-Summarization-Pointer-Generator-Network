Twins Peder and Steen Mondrup have become heroes among the endurance racing community after Peder became the first person with cerebral palsy to complete an Ironman.

Despite being confined to a wheelchair his entire life, he has completed the KMD Ironman Copenhagen Challenge using a specially designed wheelchair that his brother Steen pushed and pulled across the circuit.

The Danish twins, who competed in the event this week as Team Tvilling, were first required to swim 3.8km. For this, Steen first pulled Peder in a rubber boat through the entire swim.

Following this, the twins rode a double bicycle for a 180km, then ran a 42.2km marathon before Steen pushed his brother across the finish line in his racing wheelchair.

The brothers completed the circuit in a time of 15 hours, 42 minutes and 38 seconds.

They wrote on their website afterwards: 'We did it! Thank you. Congratulations to all competitors. We are proud to be racing with you!'

The two were born three months prematurely but Peder suffered from a lack of oxygen, causing cerebral palsy and leaving him wheelchair-bound.

But it has been no barrier, with the 34-year-old and his brother forming a formidable duo in what is considered one of the most gruelling of all endurance sports.

The brothers stop for a quick drink during the race. The twins said they were inspired by Team Hoyt - a U.S. father-son duo who race together despite son Rick Hoyt being wheelchair bound

The twin's inspiration lies with Team Hoyt, a father and son duo who together compete in marathons and Ironman competitions.

Rick Hoyt, 51, was diagnosed with celebral palsy at birth, but in 1977 told his father Dick Hoyt that he wanted to take part in a five mile benefit run.

The father son duo use a racing technique similar to the Mondrup brothers involving special two-seater bikes and running wheelchairs. The two have now competed in more than 1000 events.
