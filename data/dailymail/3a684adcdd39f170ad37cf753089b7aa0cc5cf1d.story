A high school teacher who was forced to resign after racy photos of her emerged wearing a skimpy bikini has posed for the front cover of Hustler.

Olivia Sprauer, who also goes by the name Victoria James, originally said she wouldn't pose for the magazine after she shot to fame saying: 'I don't do spread-eagle shots for the camera, so I don't think Hustler is going to work out.'

But the 26-year-old obviously had a change of heart and features on the front of March's cover.

'If getting naked betters my life, 
that’s a positive thing for me,' Sprauer said, according to a press 
release promiting the 14-page pictorial.

Sprauer said she was asked to resign after confirming to school chiefs she posed for a series of bikini-clad modeling shots.

Olivia, who models under the name Victoria Valentine James, had 
been planning to resign to pursue a modeling career.

However when school chiefs at Martin County High School saw one of her photos, she was escorted from the campus.

front of the camera!

'There is an inherent satisfaction in discovering what art the photographer and I can create!

'I
 am very fun to work with, and my creative nature can add a lot to a
