More and more people have been going on vegan detoxes since Beyonce and Jay-Z announced they were giving up eating animal products for 22 days

We have all heard of ‘Dry January’ but now some people are taking New Year’s resolutions a step further and giving up all animal products for a month.

A growing number of people are swapping to a vegan diet for a few weeks each year in a bid to ‘cleanse’ their bodies.

The diet gained popularity after singer Beyoncé and rapper Jay-Z went vegan for 22 days at the end of 2013.

The Vegan Society says more and more people are now signing up to ‘Veganuary’, the BBC reports.

It says 40 per cent more people followed the diet in the first two months of 2013 than in the first two months of 2012.

People adopt the diet temporarily for a range of reasons, including to shed their excess Christmas pounds and to detox.

Juliet Gellatley, director of the vegan and vegetarian group Viva, says most people do it either because of health concerns or because they have developed greater awareness of animal rights.

She told the BBC: ‘People might be prone to heart disease or want to get their cholesterol down.

‘Or it might be because they've seen something on factory farming. But once people turn to veganism, they usually open their minds to the other issue too.

‘The third factor, which is more unusual, is environmental reasons such as global warning or deforestation.’

The Vegan Society estimates that about 150,000 people in the UK are vegan.

This means they don't eat anything that comes from an animal: fish, meat or anything containing animal fats.

They also avoid dairy products such as cows’ milk, cheese and yoghurt and also eggs or products containing eggs.

One person to go vegan for a month is Rachel Hollos, a marketing director from London.

She says she is doing ‘Veganuary’ for the health benefits after reading that people do not really need dairy products and that cows’ milk contains hormones that put human hormones out of sync.

Venus Williams says her overall health has improved dramatically since she stopped eating animal products

She says the diet is easy to follow during the week but that she struggles when eating out at weekends.

She also admitted to missing the cakes and chocolates she had to give up because they contain butter, eggs or milk.

Ms Hollos said the diet makes her feel more energetic and less bloated but that it has also left her feeling hungry.

 A vegan diet is primarily made up of grains, beans, fruits and vegetables.

Vegans do not eat anything that comes from an animal.

Therefore, they do not eat fish, meat or anything containing animal fats.

They also avoid dairy products such as cows’ milk, cheese and yoghurt.

They do not eat eggs or products containing eggs.

They also avoid foods processed using animal products - such as refined white sugar and some wines.

They
 tend not to wear clothes made from animals - such as leather and wool -
 and using beauty products and medicines that have been tested on 
animals.

Ms Gellatley says people, especially men, used to be macho in their desire to eat meat but that many influential men are now admitting they believe a vegan diet is healthier.

She says this is making the diet more socially acceptable.

As a result, she explained there has been a ‘seismic shift in attitude’ towards going vegan and that it is ‘no longer seen as alien’.

The increasing acceptability of a vegan diet has been fuelled by a number of celebrities admitting they have adopted it.

Tennis ace Venus Williams says her overall health has improved dramatically since she stopped eating animal products.

She has Sjogren's syndrome, an auto-immune illness that causes muscular pain and fatigue, and giving up meat, she says, has eradicated the worst symptoms, including joint pain and swelling.

But she recently said: 'I think it's pretty well known that I'm a cheagan (a vegan who occasionally eats meat). I'm not perfect but I try.'

British singer Leona Lewis has also announced she has become a vegan.

Increasing evidence suggests a vegan diet has health benefits for everyone- from easing painful creaky joints to lowering cholesterol and boosting heart health.

People who eat a lot of red meat are more likely to develop arthritis, they are also at greater risk of high blood pressure, diabetes and heart disease.

But some experts argue there are many nutrients we can only get from meat - and that a vegan or vegetarian diet can have serious implications for our health.

For example, some people believe vegans risk a deficiency in vitamin B12 - which is crucial for maintaining energy levels - and in protein which is essential for maintaining muscle health.
