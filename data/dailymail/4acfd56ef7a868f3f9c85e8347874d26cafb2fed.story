A jealous boyfriend who shaved his girlfriend's prized pet Shih Tzu dog was today caught bragging about the sick act on Facebook.

Cruel Rob Davey, 26, shaved Zoe Ashman's pet pooch Franklin, which she had planned to enter at top dog show Crufts, as revenge for lying to him.

Davey, who is self-employed, was caught by police and ordered to pay £2,000 compensation, as well as being and sentenced to a 12-month community order.

However, despite his court punishment the 
remorseless lout today taunted Miss Ashman when he updated his Facebook status 
to read: 'Coming soon to stores near you after shave by rob davey "hair 
of the dog".'

He then added: 'Also coming soon rob's dog grooming service', as well as adding a post which appeared to reference his court appearance hitting the headlines and read 'Fame ay? So easy to come by'.

Neighbours revealed today how 
police had been called to dog-lover Miss Ashman's house in Hertford, 
Hertfordshire, on a number of occasions during the couple's stormy 
seven-month relationship.

Bragging: Rob Davey boasted of shaving Shih Tzu Franklin just days after he was sentenced for the cruel crime

Joking: Davey also appeared to joke about how his court appearance had hit the headlines on his Facebook page

Friends told how she had eventually 
dumped Davey because of his wild, loutish behaviour - which they said 
was often linked to him drinking too much.

They also said that Miss Ashman, who owns six dogs which she grooms for competitions, had been devastated by the attack which had ruined her dreams of rearing a grand champion.

Terry Fryatt, 24, said: 'She rang me crying saying he had cut the dog.

'She was really upset.'

'They broke up because they were always arguing.

'You know it's an argumentative relationship when the police are coming round on a weekly basis.

'There must be otherwise ways to go about it, rather than shaving her dog.'

Contender: Davey knew that Miss Ashman had hoped to enter Franklin in Crufts but shaved the dog because he thought that she had lied to him

Devastated: Miss Ashman's friends said that Davey's actions had dashed her dreams of rearing a Crufts champion

A 62-year-old grandmother, who lives close to Miss Ashman's home also criticised Davey's callous behaviour towards his former partner and her beloved pet.

'It's terrible,' she said. No animal deserves to be treated like that.

'He has to learn to control his temper. Bragging about what he has done is just wrong.'

Happier times: Zoe Ashman cuddles up to Rob Davey before they separated. Neighbours said that the pair had often argued

Davey was sentenced at Stevenage Magistrates' Court on Tuesday after he admitted damaging a dog by cutting its fur to the value unknown without lawful excuse.

The court heard that the separated couple had met up at Miss Ashman's house on the evening of December 5.

Davey contacted Zoe the next day and she told him that she had gone to work.

However, angry Davey, who was still at her house, did not believe her and in revenge for her 'lying' used clippers and scissors to cut the fur off her tiny dog.

Lout: Davey was sentenced to a 12-month community order and told that he must pay £2,000 in compensation by magistrates in Stevenage

Davey, also of Hertford, was aware that Miss Ashman had been hoping to enter the dog into the famous Crufts dog show.

He then scrawled the word 'liar' across the walls of Miss Ashman's house.

The court heard that Davey already had a history of convictions relating to motor crime, criminal damage, alcoholism and drugs.

Davey, who was representing himself, told the court: 'I'm deeply apologetic.

'This is not something I make a habit of doing.

'Most of my convictions are down to alcoholism.

'I'm a nice person, believe it or not.'
