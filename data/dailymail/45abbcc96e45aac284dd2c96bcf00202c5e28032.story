A student has spoken of her shock after her 'survival guide' to living with her four male flatmates became an online sensation.

Hannah Reilly's 15-point list, written as a joke on her blog, reached over 25,000 viewers in 24 hours and has been shared more than 9,000 times.

'The response was overwhelming,' said the stunned student, 21. 'My website had over 25,000 hits in 24 hours.'

Survival skills: Hannah Reilly, 21, was shocked when her blog on living with men became an online sensation

The guide to living with the members of the opposite sex includes vital tips such as not throwing out pizza crusts - which are 'for breakfast, not the bin'.

Other pointers include advice on watching football matches ('Watching the football includes the pre-match discussions, game time and the post match discussion and analysis') and cleaning.

Other pearls of wisdom include: 'There is always room in bin. Even if there isn't any room in the bin - there's always room in the bin and 'It is thoroughly acceptable to meet your very new girlfriend's parents for the first time on Christmas day. At their house. For Christmas dinner. Sometimes a man has to do what a man has to do.'

Photography student Hannah, from Aberdeen, started living with her flatmates last September as she began her final year at university.

In a rush to get into the property, she agreed to the lease before she met her flatmates. 'Moving in with the guys was easy, males have an openness and honesty and that four girls don't have.

'I miss female company, of course I do, but in this day and age all my female friends are a call, text or message away, so I'm not lonely.

'When my boyfriend visits he's met with a can of beer and FIFA propositions. He'd fit in anywhere but it's awesome that's he's made to feel so at home.'

One flatmate, Alexander Kirby-Reynolds, 23, said: 'At first, it was a little bit awkward for us guys because you care about how you act in front of girls.

'After a while though that went away and Hannah just became another one of the guys. I don't think she was too happy about the mess in the kitchen to start with but I don't think she minds now, she was fighting a losing battle.'Despite her happy friendships with Alexander, Josh Knox, John Pratt and Robin Mears, who are all 23, Hannah still experiences day-to-day frustrations.

'They'll ask me what I've done today and what my plans for tomorrow and won't listen to my answer. Twenty minutes later it'll be all "so what are you doing tomorrow Hannah?"

Sensation: Hannah has been inundated with marriage proposals following the blog's success

'Our kitchen is pretty grim and "grim" is being generous. We have a mouldy sofa, rubbish bags piled high and while I was eating my breakfast this morning I spied both a bowl and a pan so filled with mould, the original foodstuff is unrecognisable.

'I'm subject to a lot FIFA, GTA or Assassin's Creed and football matches - sometimes even two screens showing two games.

'I've developed a viewing techniques were I can stare through the screen as opposed to engage with what's going on.'

For other women hoping to combat these hardships, Hannah has offered help with the appropriate mind-set for dealing with such situations.

Hannah's words of wisdom have even led to her being called 'definite wife material' by website The Lad Bible and has since been attracted a number of marriage proposals on the web.

One would-be husband wrote: 'I dont know who you are.. but i will find you... and i WILL marry you!!'

Another keen fan said: 'Marry me? I'll share my fifa coins...' But Hannah said: 'My tolerance of FIFA and mouldy food might make me the supposed ideal wife but I highly doubt any of the proposers are my ideal husband.

'I'll be dubious until somebody shows up at my door with a pair of size 6 gold Nike Air Max and a New York Vanilla cheesecake, promising to supply me with a weekly shopping budget and unlimited hand rubs for life.'
