The U.S. government's latest attempt to stop illegal immigrants crossing the border comes via the radio.

As part of a new multi-million dollar 'Dangers Awareness Campaign', the U.S. Customs and Border Protection campaign commissioned a catchy Spanish song to be written and produced to discourage families in Honduras, Guatemala, and El Salvador from sending their children with smugglers to cross the U.S. border through Mexico.

That song - La Bestia - has subsequently become a major radio hit in Central America, with its legion of fans unaware it was created to 'teach' them something.

La Bestia - translated as 'The Beast' - refers to the notoriously dangerous freight train that migrants ride from Southern Mexico - risking robbery, kidnapping, rape, and murder - just to make it to the U.S. border, reports The Daily Beast.

Unaccompanied minors ride atop the wagon of a freight train, known as La Bestia (The Beast) in Ixtepec, in the Mexican state of Oaxaca. A new song widely circulated on Central American radio about the train was created by the U.S. government to subliminally dissuade migrants from crossing the border

Hundreds of thousands of migrants, mostly Central Americans, risk robbery, death from fast-moving freight trains or dehydration in the desert while trying to reach the U.S illegally

Central American migrants rest next to the train tracks while waiting for the freight train 'La Bestia', or the Beast, to travel to north Mexico to reach and cross the U.S. border

The track features lyrics such as: 'Migrants from everywhere, entrenched along the rail ties.

'Far away from where they come, further away from where they go.

'They call her the Beast from the South, this wretched train of death.

'With the devil in the boiler, whistles, roars, twists and turns.'

The vocals are by Eddie Ganz - a wedding and Bar Mitzvah singer - in Spanish.

The beat features a Caribbean flavor.

The song is just one part of the 'Dangers Awareness Campaign' assault, with billboards and other public service announcements, such as television advertisements, to be rolled out as well.

La Bestia was the brainchild of Rodolfo Hernandez, the creative director of Washington D.C. advertising agency Elevation.

The song is part of a new multimillion dollar campaign by U.S. Customs and Border Protection to discourage migrants from dangerously trying to enter the country

What makes the tune somewhat propagandist is that it is played on regular rotation by radio stations without a disclaimer.

This means listeners have no idea it was tailored specifically to them by U.S. Customs and Border Protection.

However those leading the campaign this an important detail.

They said people would not be open to the message otherwise.
