The mother of actress Lysette Anthony died from a heart attack and dropped a lit cigarette that burned down her house, an inquest heard.

Bernadette Bennett, 82, also an actress, was found dead after the fire at her seaside home near Cromer, Norfolk, in December last year.

The inquest in Norwich heard how Mrs Bennett, who had a long history of mental health problems including schizophrenia and manic depression, was believed to have died before her clothes were set on fire with a cigarette or taper she was holding.

Former model and actress Miss Anthony, 49, who was once described as The Face of the Eighties, paid tribute to her 'beautiful' mother.

Miss Anthony, who appeared in Woody Allen's Husbands and Wives, Auf Wiedersehen Pet and Three Up, Two Down, told the inquest: 'She was probably one of the kindest people I've ever known.

'She was so loving and so compassionate and so beautiful.

'The actor's life is a tough one and there were times when we were very, very poor and she did everything she could.

'She worked at Harrods just to give me everything she could. I'm just really proud to be her daughter.'

Mrs Bennett, who used the stage name Bernadette Milnes, starred in more than 50 films and TV series between 1952 and 1990 including The Elephant Man, On The Buses, Z Cars, Steptoe and Son, The Sweeney and Hancock's Half Hour.

Twice-divorced Mrs Bennett had lived in Norfolk for around ten years and was last seen by her daughter, her only child, about two weeks before she died.

The inquest heard she had been smoking between about 40 and 60 cigarettes a day in the weeks leading up to her death.

She was said to be careless in discarding bits of card or tapers that she used to light cigarettes, resulting in several scorch marks on both carpet and on her clothing.

Her body was found in the lounge of her home shortly before 4pm on December 15 by taxi driver Gavin Dickson who had become firm friends with her, along with his wife Julie.

An investigation by Norfolk Fire and Rescue Service found there was no electrical fault and that the most likely cause of the blaze was an open flame, cigarette or taper that set fire to her clothing.

Pathologist Dr Wayne Kinsey said that post-mortem examinations showed Mrs Bennett suffered from heart disease but he found no significant levels of carbon monoxide or of smoke inhalation.

He concluded there were three possible scenarios which led to her death with the most likely being that she suffered 'a cardiac event' and collapsed and died while holding a lit taper or cigarette, which then ignited her clothing.

Norfolk coroner William Armstrong recorded a narrative verdict, suggesting that the fire had started accidentally after she suffered a heart attack.

He said: 'Bernadette Bennett was found dead after a house fire at her home which had been started by her accidentally and without the intention of causing harm to herself.

'It is more likely than not that she died from a cardiac event in the context of underlying natural heart disease and not from the effects of the fire.

'No third party was involved in the death.'Â
