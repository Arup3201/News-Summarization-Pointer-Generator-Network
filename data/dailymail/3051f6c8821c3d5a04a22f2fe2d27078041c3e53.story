Barcelona are trying to find a structure of payment to suit Liverpool’s demands over Luis Suarez.

Liverpool are holding out for £75million but Barcelona are hoping to make the payment in stages, with part based on performances.

But the deal looks imminent, with one sports shop in Barcelona, Futbolmania, already offering 'Suarez 9' shirts for sale.

VIDEO Suarez to Barca talks open 

The Reds have been told that Alexis
 Sanchez does not wish to join them and it seems increasingly likely 
that the Chile international will choose Arsenal.

Arsenal remain favourites for Sanchez but Manchester City and United have expressed interest, as have Juventus. 

Sanchez is flying from Santiago, Chile to
Barcelona to discuss the offers on the table.

An announcement on Suarez is expected with Barcelona hoping to break the news officially soon.

Suarez could make a swift return to 
England with Barcelona due for pre-season training at the FA's St 
George's Park on July 28, although Suarez will not be able to train 
under the restrictions of his four-month ban.
