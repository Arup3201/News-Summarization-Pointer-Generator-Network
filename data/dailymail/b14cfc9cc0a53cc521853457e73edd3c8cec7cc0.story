'Unfair advantage': Prince Charles is facing fresh scrutiny over his finances - with MPs claiming his tax payments are not transparent

Prince Charles is facing fresh scrutiny over his finances, as MPs claimed his tax payments are not transparent and the way he is funded may offer an ‘unfair advantage’.

A powerful committee said the Duchy of Cornwall, the private estate of lucrative land and property holdings which paid the Prince a record income of £19milion last year, does not pay businesses taxes.

And while they praised the heir to the throne for voluntarily agreeing to pay income tax, he was accused of disguising the exact rate he pays by lumping it together with his VAT.

Margaret Hodge, chair of the Commons Public Accounts Committee, said a number of steps needed to be taken to bring the Duchy ‘more in line with the expectations of the present day.’ 

The Duchy, worth £847million, is not liable for corporation tax or capital gains tax.

Mrs Hodge said: ‘The Duchy enjoys an exemption from paying tax even though it engages in a range of commercial activities. This tax exemption my give it an unfair advantage over its competitors who do pay corporation tax and capital gains tax.

‘The Treasury should examine whether the Duchy’s tax exemption creates an unlevel playing field.’ 

Clarence House denied this was the case. A spokesman said: ‘As we explained in the PAC hearing, we do not believe we have a competitive advantage. The Duke of Cornwall’s income is taxed at income tax rates.

‘The Duchy is not subject to corporation tax and the Duchy is not a corporation. The Duchy is exempt from any tax on capital gains, any capital gains have to be reinvested in the business and cannot be distributed.’

MPs claimed in their report on the Duchy of Cornwall published today that it was ‘not transparent precisely how much and what rate of income tax is paid by the Prince of Wales'.

He paid £4.4million in tax last year – and they acknowledged the ‘vast majority’ of it was income tax. But earlier this year the committee accused the prince of paying a lower tax rate – at 23.6pc – than his domestic servants.

In this report they call for the two payments to be disclosed separately, and also accused the Treasury of failing to scrutinise the Duchy’s finances rather than relying only on reports from estate officials.

But Mrs Hodge said the Duchy of Cornwall - which comprises more than 50,000 acres in land in 24 countries including The Oval cricket ground in London as well as lucrative investments - had ‘performed well’ in 2012-13.

It increased its total income to £28.8million and produced an overall surplus of £19.1million.

Last night one of the country’s leading tax experts, who did not wish to be named, blasted the committee’s report saying they were mistaken in suggesting the Duchy should pay businesses taxes and accused the committee of ‘ill- informed financial showboating’.

‘It disappoints me that they have perpetuated this error in suggesting that the Duchy ought to pay a corporation tax’, the expert said.

‘It is not a corporation. It is a private estate, a private dukedom on which the beneficiary pays income tax. In actual fact the Prince of Wales doesn’t have to even do that but does so voluntarily.’ 

He said the one area where he agreed with the committee was on the amount of tax the prince was allowed to write off as expenses – which was £10.9million, or more than half his income.

‘I don’t think many private clients would be given such a generous expense allowance. And I also agree with them in their argument about separating the prince’s VAT and income tax. They are very different things and there is no logical reason for lumping them together’, he said.

In a July session of the committee, Labour MP Austin Mitchell claimed the prince was paying a lower tax rate than his servants.

He claimed Charles’ payment of 23.6pc of his income in direct and indirect taxes compared with 38 per cent paid by the poorest quarter of the population.
