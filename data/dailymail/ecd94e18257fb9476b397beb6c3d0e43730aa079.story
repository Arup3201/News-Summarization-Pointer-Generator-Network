Each year the European Commission does its bit to help out holidaymakers when it comes to mobile charges when travelling abroad.

But it seems we are still scared, if not unaware, of the costs we may incur while using our phones abroad.

What is certain is that most holidaymakers are not making the most of their smartphones or tablets abroad despite over 70 per cent owning an iPhone, iPad or similar devices, according to a recent study.

Say 'cheese': We are being urged to take advantage of mobile technology while abroad

The study found that 60 per cent of travellers are not aware of rule changes in EU countries, including France, Spain and Italy, which capped roaming charges on mobile devices.

A further 83 per cent either over or under-estimate how much it would cost to use their mobile devices, and only 30 per cent who understand the changes are more relaxed about undertaking internet searches as a result. 

A few adventurous souls have downloaded apps, videos or searched the internet on a snow-scooter in Finland, while walking the Great Wall of China, out in the Sahara Desert, or even in a French brothel.

Others have successfully scoured the web while diving off the Great Barrier Reef, scaling mountains, or on safari. Seventy five per cent however stick to the hotel when it comes to looking things up online.

Many of us are still confused as to just what we will be charged for 'roaming' while abroad

The tariff is per Megabyte to download data or browse the Internet whilst travelling abroad (charged per Kilobyte used). As you can see, the amount is going down year on year.

Speaking to MailOnline Travel, Ashley Scott, media relations manager at Virgin Media, said: 'Customers have to be aware that the roaming cap applies just to data, but it is within the whole EU.

'This is set at €50, which was set by the European Commission back in July 2012. Once this amount has been reached, you then have to "opt in" to spending more than that amount.

'When you arrive in another country in the EU, you will get a text from a partner company to your network, which will explain what the charges are for calls and texts, as well as how much data costs.

'It's important to stress that the cap is only set on data.'

Once the cap has been reached, the cost per megabyte would be charged at 16p in the EU plus VAT.

1. Turn off push notifications in apps

2. Use data bolt-ons or data cap usage

3. Switch off video auto play

4. Disable weather apps

5. Preload Google Maps with wifi

6. Switch on aeroplane mode

7. Use a pay and go SIM

8. Switch off your voicemail

9. Switch off high volume email accounts

10. Connect to wifi

Guy Hibbert, managing director of FrenchEntree, the specialist property website that conducted the research, added: 'Despite most of us taking our devices away with us, many are simply not taking advantage of adhoc events or amazing restaurant offers abroad, because of our lack of understanding and misperceptions about roaming charges.' 

Virgin customers, for example, have to purchase a 'travel pass' when they are in the EU, which enables roaming.

A 10MB travel pass costs £1.50, a 50MB pass costs £6 and a 250MB pass is £20.

Virgin also has a Smartcall service, which allows customers to use their home phone talk plans when they are abroad when connected to wifi.

The new caps only apply when you use a mobile within the EU, the rest of Europe is exempt. But statistics also show that just half of travellers realise the new rules are limited to European Union countries.

Endsleigh Insurance has researched the exact cost of using the most popular mobile apps outside the EU and in the rest of the world.

Based on O2 data roaming charges, the results make for some scary reading.

It costs 3p per megabyte of data roaming in Europe, but a whopping £6 in the rest of the world.

Based on a photo taken from an iPhone 5 camera (which has an average size of 2MB) it would cost 76p to upload a photo onto Facebook, Instagram or Twitter.

With the cap on data and more transparency with call and text calls, panic over your phone bill should be a thing of the past

This estimate also does not include being on Facebook itself, which would use data, especially if the user scrolls through friends' status updates, which can be text, images or videos which all require data to load. Facebook also now auto plays videos which can push the cost of browsing up further if this feature isn’t turned off.

Streaming a 30-minute episode of a television programme abroad could cost up to £540, the equivalent of a flight to Mauritius with Thomas Cook.

Chatting to friends on Whatsapp will set you back up to £12 and browsing the Internet for 30 minutes could cost up to £60.

Sara Newell, gadget sector manager at Endsleigh Insurance said: ‘We are so accustomed to using our phones every day for entertainment, keeping up to date with news, and staying connected with friends: everyday apps we take for granted in the UK, if used in the same way abroad, can rack up unexpected bills that can exceed the actual cost of a holiday.

'We’ve seen bills rack up into the thousands, so would advise on planning ahead to avoid a nasty surprise when you get back.

'Check data roaming charges with your provider, get prepared with a data bolt on or usage cap, or switch off data roaming on your phone altogether.'
