First there was the app that enabled users to find a great deal on a hotel for that very evening.

And now booking a room just got even more cutting edge, with a new service allowing travellers to arrange their hotel stay via Twitter.

'Hotel bidding' company Stayful launched #TweetStay on Tuesday, matching Tweeters with independent boutique hotels owners through the social media platform.

Potential customers tweet their hotel request, mentioning @Stayful and the hashtag #TweetStay, their travel dates, destination and budget.

The travel has to be within 30 days and currently Stayful only covers 23 US cities and Vancouver. There are plans to expand to more American and Canadian destinations.

Following the tweet, Stayful negotiates room rates with boutique hotels matching the request, and responds to the tweeter with a link to the offers.

Stayful launched last summer with the concept of hotel guests 'naming their price' when booking rooms.

Handy: Users tweet their request to hotel bidding company Stayful, who respond with offers

Focusing only on independently-owned boutique hotels, the website allows members to place a bid for how much they would like to pay per night for a particular hotel.

Stayful present the bid to the hotel and negotiate on the member's behalf to get a deal on the room rate.

Hotels can accept the first bid, counter offer, or decline the bid entirely (if the member has bid a dollar a night for a penthouse suite, perhaps).

The company suggests a recommended opening bid that is appropriate for the room type and hotel that is still below the advertised rate.

They also offer a 'Book Now' option at a set rate.

There have been about 20 request using the #TweetStay since it launched yesterday.

Stayful co-founder and CEO Cheryl Rosner said: 'Hotels want to make sure they book all their rooms, and travelers want a great deal.

'Since we negotiate prices behind the scenes in real time, we can offer TweetStay customers a better price than they can find online.'
