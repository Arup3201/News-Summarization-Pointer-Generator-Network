Manchester City's young forward Marcos ‘Rony’ Lopes is set to be loaned out for the duration of next season, with French club Lille the likely destination.

The Portuguese 18-year-old is rated by City coaches as the most exciting talent at the club and Lopes was handed three starts in cup competitions by Manuel Pellegrini last season.

He appeared in both legs of City’s Capital One Cup semi-final victory over West Ham, earning rave reviews for his performances at Upton Park.

Lopes has stood out under the guidance of Patrick Vieira in City’s Elite Development Squad and the City under-21 team captain is now set to be exposed to competitive, first-team football on the continent.

It is understood that a number of clubs have registered an interest both at home and abroad but talks between Lille and Manchester City have taken place and are progressing well.

City view the French team, managed by Rene Girard, as the ideal place for the technically excellent youngster to develop his game and both parties are hopeful are concluding a deal ahead of pre-season.
