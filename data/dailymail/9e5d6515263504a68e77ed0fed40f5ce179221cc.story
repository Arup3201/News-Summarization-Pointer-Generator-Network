Nottingham Forest fans travelling to White Hart Lane for the club's Capital One Cup fixture against Tottenham have been pictured boarding coaches to the game in commemorative Brian Clough jumpers.

Cup sponsors Capital One have given Forest supporters 1000 iconic green jumpers to remember the life of Clough, their former manager, who died 10 years ago this week.

A picture, posted on the Capital One Cup Twitter page, shows hordes of Forest fans waiting to board coaches to take them to London, with television crews filming their departure.

Some fans will also be given the item of clothing at the ground on a first-come-first served basis in honour of one of English football's finest-ever managers.

The maverick manager enjoyed an 18-year spell in charge at the City ground between 1975-1993 as he lead Forest to their most successful spell as a club - guiding them to two successive European Cup triumphs in 1979 and 1980, one league title and four League Cup successes.

Last Sunday, Forest fans joined with supporters of fierce rivals Derby County to pay tribute to Clough with a minute's applause for their mutual former manager - who also steered the Rams to the league title for the first time in the club's history.

John McGovern, Nottingham Forest club ambassador, said: 'Brian was simply the best. There will never ever be anyone in football quite like Brian again. 

'He is synonymous with Nottingham Forest and to see 1,000 Forest fans in green jumpers at such a high profile game will be a fantastic way to mark the anniversary.'

Jason Carr, head of sponsorship at Capital One, said: 'As a Nottingham-based company and sponsor of the Capital One Cup we know what Brian Clough means to the City of Nottingham. 

'It is important for us to help Nottingham Forest fans show their support for such an integral individual in their club's history and we hope that the green jumpers will be a great nod of respect to him.'
