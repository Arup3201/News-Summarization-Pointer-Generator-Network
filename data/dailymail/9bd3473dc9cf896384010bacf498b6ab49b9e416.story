Do you know where Professor Stephen Hawking was born, or in which city Manchester United won its second European Cup in 1999?

If so, you can now put this knowledge to the test using Google’s Smarty Pins game.

Players are either given a mix of topics, or can select their favourite categories, and questions are answered by placing pins in the correct location on Google Maps. 

Google has launched a geography-based trivia game called Smart Pins (pictured). Questions about various topics are answered by placing pins in the correct location on Google Maps. The first questions are based in a player's local country, but as they progress the playing board expands to the rest of the world

Each player starts with 1,000 miles, which act as points.

A question appears and the map centres to reveal the country the answer relates to.

Once a pin has been dropped, the player can either submit the answer, or reposition the pin.

If the answer is correct, a ‘Nailed it!’ message will appear.

If the answer is wrong, Google calculates the distance in miles between the two locations and take this off the total mileage.

Once the mileage counter hits zero, the game is over, but if the answer is submitted within 15 seconds, players receive bonus miles. 

A question appears in the top left-hand corner, and the map centres to reveal the country or region the answer relates to.

Once a pin has been dropped, the player can either submit the answer, or reposition the pin if they want to correct their answer.

The aim is to drop the pin as close to the correct location as possible.

For example, if the answer is Chelsea’s football ground Stamford Bridge, dropping the pin elsewhere in the Chelsea region will be wrong.

If the answer is correct, a ‘Nailed it!’ message will appear.

But if the answer is wrong, Google calculates the distance in miles between the two locations and take this off the total mileage.

Once the mileage counter reaches zero, the game is over, but if the answer is submitted within 15 seconds, the player receives bonus miles.

Each question additionally comes with a hint to help pinpoint the location more accurately.

To answer a random selection of questions across five main categories, including Arts & Culture, Science & Geography, Sports & Games, Entertainment and History & Current Events, players click Start Game. Alternatively, they can select individual topics (pictured left). There is also a Featured Topics category which selects topical questions. As players progress through the questions they are awarded different coloured pins - bronze for five answers, (pictured right), silver for 10, and gold for 15

The game is similar to Nintendo classic Mario is Missing, (pictured) in which players navigate around the world as Luigi, answering geography-based questions

As players progress through the questions they are awarded different coloured pins, starting with a bronze pin for five answers, silver for 10 and gold for 15.

These pins are awarded for the total number of questions answered, not just the questions answered correctly.

Each coloured pin, and ultimately the score, can be shared with social networks, or via email.
