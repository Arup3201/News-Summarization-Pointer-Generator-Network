A British man who slaughtered a girl who turned down his advances has been jailed for at least 35 years after he repeatedly stabbed her and also stabbed her parents to death in their home.

Prosecutors said he left the bodies in their 'blood soaked' home after stabbing his victims at least 112 times.

Jason Alexander Downie, originally from Kilmarnock, Scotland, emigrated to Australia with his mother in 2006, pleaded guilty to stabbing 16-year-old Chantelle Rowe and her parents Andrew and Rose in the South Australian town of Kapunda in November 2010.

Supreme Court Justice John Sulan sitting in Adelaide today said Downie, who was 18 when he committed the murders, had been sexually obsessed with Chantelle and jealous of his friend who was dating her.

He broke into the Rowe family home, killed Chantelle's father Andrew, then her mother Rose and then raped Chantelle before stabbing her to death.

She was stabbed more than 33 times, Andrew at least 29 times and Rose more than 50 times.

Downie's lawyer, Mr Greg Mead, said his client did not remember everything that had happened but he told the court that he had not intended to kill anyone.

His intention, said Mr Mead, was to confront Chantelle's boyfriend in the mistaken belief that he was staying there.

Outside court, Christopher, brother to Chantelle, was too distraught to speak. His cousin, Kylie Duffield, read a statement on his behalf

Prosecutors said Chantelle had put up with Downie's unwanted attitude because he was friends with her boyfriend, whose baby she was expecting.

Officials stressed that at no time was the teenage woman in a relationship with Downie.

Prosecutors said it 'would not be an exaggeration' to call the scene of the murder as blood-soaked.

During his court appearances, Downie had shown little reaction, even when victim impact statements were read from the Rowe family's relatives and friends.

At an earlier hearing he glared at Andrew Rowe's sister when she confronted him across the courtroom and demanded to know what right he had to 'take away three angels'.

The court heard that five days after the murders, a TV crew shot footage of Downie visiting a memorial for the Rowe family.

Regarded as a an outsider in Kapunda - where a number of British ex-patriates live - Downie, now aged 20, has made it clear on social media that he hated the place. Even so, he claimed he was popular.

His postings have listed him as being 'in a relationship' and said he 'enjoyed partying and hanging out with my friends.'

He added: 'I love my sport, I am very active on and off the basketball court if you know what I mean.'

He wrote that he loved basketball and the Saw horror movies. He was devoted to his mother, he said, despite their occasional clashes.

Downie wrote a letter apologising for his crimes. He will serve at least 35 years in jail

Chantelle was listed in his postings as a friend.

Leaving school, he said, was the best thing to happen to him and his worst fear was 'not seeing my family.'

He added: 'Love my family in Scotland, haven't seen them for six years.

'I grew up without a dad since I was two months old, so I have been raised up by my mum all my life...I respect and love her to death, even though we have our bad moments.'
