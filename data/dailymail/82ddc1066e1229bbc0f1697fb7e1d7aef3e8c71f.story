Roberto Martinez will meet Samuel Eto’o this weekend to discover his plans as the striker edges closer to leaving Everton.

Eto’o missed the FA Cup replay with West Ham on Tuesday after he told Martinez he was not in the right frame of mind to play; Everton’s manager then gave him permission to travel to the Middle East, where he has an offer from Qatari side Al Gharafa.

The three-time Champions League winner is also the subject of strong interest from Sampdoria and his agent, Claudio Vigorelli, claimed he has agreed a deal to move to Genoa, despite a lucrative offer from Brazilian side Santos.

Roberto Martinez and Samuel Eto'o are set for talks this weekend after rumours the striker wants to leave

Should Eto’o leave, Everton would look to command a fee but Martinez has not ruled out the possibility of the 33-year-old still being at Goodison Park beyond the window.

So far he has made 12 starts in all competitions and if that figure were to reach 15, Eto’o would automatically trigger a one-year extension to stay at Everton and Martinez wants to see what his intentions are going forward and if he is able to play against West Brom on Monday.

‘Sampdoria haven't contacted us,’ said Martinez. ‘We don't know. Maybe he has made his mind up. He has trained really well. Whether he is involved on Monday is something I’m going to decide before the game, depending on the needs of the squad and the needs of Samuel.

‘I'm not looking at these games for Samuel to be involved because it's not right, unless we have made a decision one way or the other, which allows Samuel to be fully focused on what he's doing. While the window is open, he is allowed to consider his options. If he stays, we will welcome that.’

There have been suggestions Eto’o has become a disruptive influence in the dressing room but Martinez said: ‘No, no. I know we have a lot of these stories coming out but the players laugh at them. There is nothing sinister. He has a few options and is looking at them.’
