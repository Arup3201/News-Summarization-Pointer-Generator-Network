A simple chemical found in strawberries and apples could reduce the damage to the heart in the aftermath of an attack

Survival rates after a heart attack or stroke could be significantly boosted after a breakthrough by British scientists.

A simple chemical found in strawberries and apples could reduce the damage to the heart in the aftermath of an attack.

A team led by doctors and biologists at Cambridge University think that if the substance is injected following an attack, it could reduce long-term injury to vital organs.

The breakthrough, published in the journal Nature tonight, came about after the team established the mechanism by which damage is done to organs after a heart attack or stroke.

While much of the harm is suffered during the attack itself, injury is also done when blood floods back into the organs afterwards.

When surgeons clear the clot that caused the attack - a process vital for survival - blood and oxygen rushes back into the heart or brain, in a process called reperfusion.

Doctors have long been frustrated by the fact that by saving the patient’s life, they do further damage to the body.

But until now that process had been a mystery.

The new study, carried out on computer models and confirmed in mice, revealed that the damage is done by a chemical called succinate which occurs naturally in the body.

The researchers, from Cambridge, Kings College London, University College London and Glasgow University, found that succinate builds up to abnormally high levels in tissue starved of oxygen during an attack.

When the blood flow returns, the succinate interacts with oxygen, combing to release destructive new molecules which kill off cells in the heart or other organs.

The injury means that in months and years after a heart attack, there is an increased risk of heart failure or other problems.

Crucially, the researchers discovered they could reduce organ damage in mice by injecting simple chemicals called malonate esters.

Injected during the treatment of a stroke or heart attack, the chemical could stop the build-up of succinate and the resulting release of destructive molecules.

Malonate esters are cheap, readily available and are found naturally in fruits such as strawberries, apples and grapes, although not in high enough volumes to be beneficial by eating alone.

Dr Michael Murphy of Cambridge University said: ‘This research explains how organ damage occurs during the first few minutes of restoring blood supply after a heart attack or stroke and, importantly, how to stop this damage.

‘We have used simple chemicals found in everyday fruits like apples and grapes that had never been suspected as being therapeutically useful before. Amazingly, these chemicals worked very well.’

Professor Peter Weissberg, medical director at the British Heart Foundation, which funded the study, said: ‘We have no way of knowing how much damage is caused during a heart attack and how much during reperfusion. 

'But it is a reasonable assumption to say that if we could reduce reperfusion damage we could reduce the risk of later heart failure.

‘There are reasons to be optimistic that we could see this move quickly towards a treatment now that the basic findings have been made.

‘Drugs companies are certainly very interested and we could see clinical trials within a few years.’
