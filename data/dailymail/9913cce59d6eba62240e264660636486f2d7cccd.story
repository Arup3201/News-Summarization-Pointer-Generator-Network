The sinister figure caught on camera as he prowls around inside the multi-million pound home at night would terrify anyone.

This is the prolific burglar who has left Boris Becker’s wife living in fear after twice trying to break into the couple’s Wimbledon mansion.

Lilly Becker said she leaves lights on all the time and her home is ‘almost a fort’ after the thief was filmed on CCTV outside. She has even considered moving.

Caught! A prolific burglar, who has targetted homes in Wimbledon Village since 2006, is caught on CCTV while raiding the kitchen of a house in Wimbledon, London

Boris Becker pictured with his wife Lilly. Their home in Wimbledon Common has been targetted by a prolific burglar who raids multi-million pound houses in Wimbledon, south west London. His wife said she feels scared in their home

‘Our freedom has been taken away,’ said the Dutch model, 37, who has a young son with her 46-year-old husband.

‘I would do anything to protect my family. But I am a skinny little woman, there’s not a lot I can do.’

These images are from some of the homes the ‘meticulous’ cat burglar has targeted in wealthy Wimbledon Village, south-west London.

The Beckers are among up to 150 of his victims – including City workers, celebrities and sports stars – over the past seven years.

The intruder often wears a tracksuit, gloves and a black fishing hat, although his dark clothing shows up light on the infra-red images.

In the main picture the man has a torch in his mouth and is holding what might be a lock-picking device as he searches a home near Wimbledon Common on March 29 last year.

He escaped with a large quantity of cash and jewellery.

Another CCTV image released by police captures the moment the burglar discovers a hidden camera while calmly wandering around a victim’s kitchen.

The burglar, who wears a trademark black fishing hat and black clothing, bags cash and jewellery from the homes by stashing it in his pockets. Police believe he has raided up to 150 homes

The man has had to flee from properties at least three times after being interrupted by homeowners - but has still never been caught

Footage shows him holding his hand over his mouth.

Police believe he may be making a voice recording of home security details and other features in preparation for breaking in again.

In some cases he has cut CCTV cables and disabled alarm systems and is known to steal little on his first visit, leaving some  victims unaware and vulnerable to a future break-in.

On one occasion he was spotted arriving in a dark Vauxhall hatchback, climbing over a fence and cutting the cables to CCTV cameras before trying to force back doors.

Detectives are desperate to catch the criminal who is believed to spend days plotting his crimes so that he does not leave a trace.

He was caught trying to get  into the Beckers’ home last  October.

The alarm was set off and he fled, but officers have discovered that he tried to get in again on another occasion.

Mrs Becker, whose husband won the Wimbledon men’s singles title three times in the 1980s, said she cannot believe the burglar’s reign of terror has lasted so long.

She added: ‘Not only do I have to switch on alarms, I have to leave lights on in the house.

‘I can’t enjoy the living room because it’s connected to the  garden where he has jumped over a few times

‘He can’t make this his profession, he cannot just get away with this and take people’s stuff.

‘We have even talked about  moving and really creating almost a fort, making it so safe that I feel safe, and it shouldn’t be like this.’

Detective Inspector Dan O’Sulllivan of Wimbledon CID said: ‘We are asking for the public’s help so that we can bring this man to justice. He clearly spends a significant amount of time away from home in the early hours, something which cannot go unnoticed by his family and friends.’

Anyone with information is asked to contact Merton Police on 020 8649 3159 or Crimestoppers anonymously on 0800 555 111.
