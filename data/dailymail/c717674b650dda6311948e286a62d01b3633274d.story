Rugby star Gavin Henson has been sacked from his team Cardiff Blues, following his drunken behaviour on a flight back from Glasgow on Saturday morning.

Henson, 30, apologised for his actions saying he was 'truly embarrassed' but he has been dismissed with immediate effect following a meeting of the Blues management this morning.

The club described his behaviour as 'unacceptable' and cancelled his eight-month contract.

The former fiance of Charlotte Church and Strictly contestant admitted he 'behaved inappropriately' after allegedly throwing ice cubes at other passengers.

Henson went on an all-night bender after Cardiff Blues were thrashed 31-3 by Glasgow Warriors.

It is understood he went out in 
Glasgow city centre after Cardiff's match on Friday night and did not 
return to the team's hotel until 5am to catch a plane at 7am.

'I stupidly carried on drinking 
during the flight, for which I am truly embarrassed,' said the Welshman yesterday morning, in a 
statement via his management company.

October 2005: Henson releases a book but is forced to apologise in front of his team-mates for comments about the Wales team.December 2005: Henson is cited for elbowing Leicester's Alex Moreno in a Heineken Cup game and banned for 10 weeks and two days, reduced to seven weeks on appeal.December 2007: Henson is charged with disorderly conduct over his behaviour on a train after helping Ospreys beat Harlequins in the Anglo-Welsh Cup. The case is later dropped.April 2011: After his second appearance for French club Toulon, against Toulouse, he is involved in an altercation with two team-mates in a nightclub and is suspended for a week.March 2012: Henson is suspended by Cardiff Blues after the incident on the flight back from Scotland after their match against Glasgow Warriors the previous night. He later apologises for drinking and 'behaving inappropriately'.

'I
can see that drinking and behaving inappropriately on that flight as a 
professional sportsman at 7am has caused offence to members of the 
public, the Flybe airline staff and passengers.

'I
know that I have let my team-mates, coaches, management, sponsors and 
indeed my family down with my actions. Drinking on that plane was 
inexcusable and I know that I must take responsibility for it.

'I also accept that in the light of this I need to learn from it and ensure this does not happen again.

'I am prepared to co-operate 100 per 
cent with the Cardiff Blues wishes and will do everything that I need to
do in order to make amends and enable the Blues to focus on our biggest
game of the season next weekend.

'I remain fully focused and committed to Cardiff Blues and I hope they can accept my apology.'

Rugby insiders said Henson, who has two children with the singer Charlotte Church, was probably finished as a player.

Former Wales captain Gwyn Jones said: 'It's no surprise that we're talking about Henson and it's got nothing to do with rugby.

'It's clear that he can't handle alcohol, he becomes a different person.

'It's the end of the season, everyone's out of contract and you're looking for your next job.

'You should be doing everything you can to secure a future.

'Who's going to sign this guy who's 30, who hasn't played well for four years and he's going to come with a whole load of baggage?'

Cardiff Blues chief executive Richard Holland said, 'The Cardiff Blues management have discussed the matter at length but have acted swiftly since the incident occurred on Saturday morning.'

'Gavin admitted himself that his behaviour was totally unacceptable and the immediate termination of his contract sends out a clear message that behaviour like that will not be tolerated at the Blues.'

'We have a duty to our supporters and sponsors to protect the good name of Cardiff Blues and those associated with our brand.'

'Gavin Henson is obviously a talented rugby player and it's unfortunate that his career at the Blues has ended this way.

'However, we would like to thank him for his service and wish him the best of luck with his future career.'

Split: Henson split from his girlfriend Carianne Barrow, 25, earlier this year after meeting her on reality show The Bachelor

A Flybe spokesman said: 'The safety of our passengers and staff is Flybe's number one priority and as such the airline has a zero tolerance attitude to unruly behaviour on board our aircraft.

'We are grateful for Mr. Henson's apology following Saturday's flight from Glasgow to Cardiff.

'However, in line with company policy, we have written to him, informing him that he will be banned from Flybe services for a period of six months.'

Henson is no stranger to controversy.

Last May he left French club Toulon following a bust-up with team-mates.

In December
2007 he was accused of disorderly conduct on a train, although charges were later  dropped.

Two years later he was cautioned by 
police investigating an alleged assault, while in 2005 he was questioned by Wales team officials over an 
incident in a pub.

The player – who has won 33 caps for Wales – has seen his rugby career falter in recent years.

He split from Miss Church, 26, in 2010, only six months after announcing
their engagement.

The pair have two children, Ruby, four, and Dexter, 
three.
