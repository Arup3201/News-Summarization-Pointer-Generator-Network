A migraine sufferer has banished the crippling headaches which once left her sick and incapacitated for days, using a high-tech headband which emits electrical pulses to the brain.

The silver headband may look and sound like a prop form a sci-fi film. But Cefaly exists and the medical device is now available in the UK, having relieved the painful symptoms of migraine sufferers across Europe and the U.S.

The non-invasive device claims to be free of any side-effects and works by applying neurostimulation to the nerves affected by migraine attacks.

Fay Sharples, 26, from Morecambe in Lancashire, told MailOnline the device has changed her life, easing her debilitating headaches in one day, after five weeks of treatment.

Cefaly, a silver headband that emits electrical pulses to the supraorbital nerve in the brain, can ease the effects and length of migraines. Fay Sharpes (pictured) wears the device for 20 minutes before going to bed and says that now her migraines clear in one day instead of three, and the intensity of the pain has reduced

Migraine sufferers are advised to wear the device for 20
 minutes every day as a preventative measure or at 
the start of an attack to help to relieve the symptoms.

In a recent study carried out on 67 patients across five centres in Belgium, 38 per cent of people who used Cefaly reported getting migraines half as often.

They could also take 37 per cent less medication each month.

The Migraine Trust estimates that around eight million people in the UK suffer from the condition, which can include severe headaches, nausea and vomiting, flashing lights and exhaustion.

Many sufferers struggle to hold down jobs or look after their families. Currently there is no cure, with treatment usually limited to over the counter or prescription drugs, many of which have unpleasant side effects. 

It is a scenario Ms Sharples, 26, an auditor, recognises only too well.

‘One
 of the worse things about having migraines is that, once you have tried
 all the drugs, done all the alternative therapies and kept a food 
diary, you are pretty much left to cope by yourself,’ she said. 

Most headaches and migraines involve the trigeminal nerve.

Its superior branch ends at the exit of the eye socket, underneath the skin of the forehead.

An adhesive electrode is positioned on the forehead and Cefaly connects to this.

Through the electrode, Cefaly generates precise micro-impulses in order to stimulate the nerve endings of the trigeminal nerve.

Neurostimulation of the trigeminal nerve produces a relaxing effect.

Regular repetition of this effect helps reduce the number of headaches and migraines, according to the company.

‘I had my first mild migraine when I was 12 and by my early 20s I was having three to four attacks a month, which included agonising headaches and being sick. Sometimes the attacks merged into each other, lasting for days at a time.

‘I was put on to some quite serious drugs including Topiramate, which makes me feel exhausted and Naproxinal which caused stomach upset. I also took Imigran but none of the drugs really helped.

‘Migraines made my life a misery. I lost endless working days and my friends got used to me cancelling social engagements.

'Holidays can be a nightmare. One particular attack in America was especially bad. Luckily I have an understanding boyfriend - but all I wanted was a life without migraines.

‘So when I heard about Cefaly I thought I had nothing to lose.

‘I started about five weeks ago and kept a record of my symptoms. I put it on for 20 minutes just before bedtime and it was very relaxing.

‘By week two the migraines were clearing in one day instead of dragging on for a few. The pain and intensity was also reducing.

‘By week four I had only had two migraines. I hadn’t taken time off sick and my “waking up headaches” had gone.

'I also felt more alert, able to concentrate and brave enough to stop taking Imigram.

'In the last week I have not had any migraines at all. If someone had told me six months ago this would happen I wouldn’t have believed them.’

Wendy Thomas of The Migraine Trust, said: ‘Neurostimulation is proving to be an exciting development in the treatment of migraines and the research on the efficacy of Cefaly is so far positive.

‘We welcome any treatment which can add to the range of options available for the many numbers of people whose lives are blighted by migraine’

Cefaly costs £295 and does not work for everyone, but there is a partial refund policy.

Users also have to pay £19.99 for disposable electrode pads which last around a month.

Neurologist Jean Schoenen, a professor at the Headache Research Unit University of Liege, Belgium, said: ‘Our research concluded that Cefaly helped around 40 per cent of patients.

‘This compares with a pharmaceutical success rate of 50 to 60 per cent - but Cefaly is almost entirely side effect free.

‘Cefaly is a useful first line treatment which may help around 40 per cent of patients to at least lessen their symptoms and the amount of drugs they have to take. If Cefaly doesn’t work for them, then the patient should be managed with other treatments.’

Ms Sharples said: ‘I know that Cefaly isn’t a cure for my migraines and that they may return. But for the first time in years I can see a light at the end of the tunnel.’
