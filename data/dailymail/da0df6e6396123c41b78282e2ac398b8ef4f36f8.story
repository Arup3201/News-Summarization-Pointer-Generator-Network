With a sheer drop of 415ft - higher than the Statue of Liberty - and travelling at speeds of 90mph, a new record-breaking ride will not be for the faint-hearted.

A New Jersey company is planning to build the 41-story drop ride, making it the world’s tallest.

Six Flags Great Adventure says Zumanjaro: Drop of Doom will hoist riders 415 feet in the air and drop them back to the ground at 90 mph.

The stomach-churning attraction will be attached to what is itself the world’s tallest roller coaster, Kingda Ka in Jackson, New Jersey.

Breathtaking: Zumanjaro will drop brave riders 41 stories at 90mph. At the top, they'll be able to see the skyline of Philadelphia 52 miles away

Zumanjaro’s three towers, each 41 stories tall, will be nestled inside the green loop of the current ride.

Three gondolas will carry brave riders up the face of Kingda Ka. They will drop from just below the coaster’s 456-foot peak as Kingda Ka’s trains rocket toward them at 128 mph.

Each of the towers will feature a gondola for eight riders, which will help keep lines for the ride as short as possible.

At the top - far higher than the 305ft Statue of Liberty - riders will be able to see the skyline of Philadelphia, which lies 52 miles away.

At 415ft high, Zumanjaro will surpass 400ft Lex Luthor: Drop of Doom at Six Flags Magic Mountain near Los Angeles as the world’s tallest drop tower ride.

‘Zumanjaro solidifies Six Flags Great Adventure’s dominance as the Northeast’s thrill capital,’ said John Fitzgerald, park president.

He later told the Detroit Free Press: 'You’re going to have folks dropping 90 mph.

'You’re going to have the Kingda Ka cars racing around them at the same time. It’s really going to be fantastic. Fantastic views, but also terribly exciting.'

Park spokesperson Kristin Siebeneicher echoes her boss's enthusiasm.

‘It's definitely exciting that we are breaking a world record,’ Siebenecher told the New York Daily News.

Meanwhile, the park says this is the last season for its wooden Rolling Thunder roller coaster after more than three decades.

‘There are definitely guests, especially roller coaster enthusiasts, who will miss Rolling Thunder,’ Siebeneicher said.

The park says technology has surpassed the dual track coaster, which opened in 1979 and has become a beloved classic.

Zumanjaro is scheduled to open in 2014.
