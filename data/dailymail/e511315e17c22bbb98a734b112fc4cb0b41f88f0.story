Formula One's World Championship leader Nico Rosberg has tied the knot with his long-term girlfriend Vivian Sibold.

Rosberg, who is just four points ahead of Lewis Hamilton in the battle for this year's title after retiring from the British Grand Prix, posted a picture of the happy couple from their wedding day.

'We are over the Moon,' Rosberg said. 'It was very special to share our wedding day with our closest friends and family.'

Sealed with a kiss: Nico Rosberg and long-term girlfriend Vivian Sibold tied the knot in Monaco

Rosberg and childhood sweetheart Vivian got married in Monaco, but the couple won't have long to celebrate their nuptials with the Formula One circus heading to Germany for round 10 of the championship next week.

Rosberg will arrive at his home race in Hockenheim on the backfoot however, after he failed to finish last time out at Silverstone and thus handing the victory to rival Hamilton.

It was Rosberg's first retirement of the campaign; the German suffering from gearbox gremlins.
