The treatment of killer whales who perform for tourists at theme parks has been questioned by a new research that shows they are left traumatised by years of captivity.

Far from being content to perform the whales are kept in conditions that make them aggressive.

Researchers say the stress of being confined to a small pool, rather than allowed to roam the ocean, causes the killer whales to take out their frustration on their trainers.

In 2010 the dangers were tragically highlighted when an Orca killed its trainer Dawn Brancheau in front of horrified tourists at SeaWorld in Orlando, Florida.

It later emerged that the 12,000lb whale called Tilikum had previously killed another trainer and drowned a man who broke into his enclosure.

The gruesome death of Brancheau in 2010 led to an overhaul of the lucrative business of using killer whales for the entertainment of tourists in the US.

Trainers are no longer allowed in the water with the killer whales - but the pds1bn a year business is still thriving.

Tens of thousands of British tourists visit Sea World every year during trips to the Florida theme parks.

The dangers of keeping killer whales in captivity is demonstrated in a documentary film called Blackfish, which was screened at the Sheffield documentary film festival.

Director Gabriela Cowperthwaite said the killer whales should not be kept for the entertainment of tourists.

'These are huge and highly intelligent animals. They should not be in captivity,' she said.

During the making of her film she said she came across dozens of ‘near misses’ where trainers have been threatened or injured by killer whales.

'I spent two years tracking down all these incidents. There have been four deaths and many near misses and injuries, I suspect possibly hundreds - no-one likes to report them,' she said.

Apart from the well publicised death of Brancheau, who was dragged underwater by her ponytail by Tilikum, the killer whale had previously killed another trainer.

In 1991 Tilikum killed Keltie Byrne in a Canadian park and eight years later in 1999 drowned a man who had stayed behind at SeaWorld after he jumped into the pool.

Similar incidents have happened in Europe with a trainer rammed and killed by Keto, a killer whale at Loro Parque in Tenerife, one of two marine parks in Europe to hold the creatures.

The other is Marineland in Antibes, France, where dangerous incidents, but no deaths, have been recorded.

Since the 1960s killer whales have been used for entertainment at theme parks, including Flamingo Land in North Yorkshire where an orca called Cuddles was the star attraction.

Research by Cowperthwaite and Whale and Dolphin Conservation has revealed that Cuddles became so aggressive that his keepers had to clean the pool from the protection of a shark cage.

Britain has since banned zoos from keeping whales and dolphins, but around the world there are still 44 in captivity.

Author David Kirby said the aggressive behaviour of Tilikum was not unusual among captive killer whales.

'Tilikum is a very disturbed and dangerous animal but I know of at least 20 other captive animals showing similar behaviour,' said Kirby who has written a book Death at SeaWorld, chronicling the death of 40 year old Brancheau.

'They bite people, ram them, leap out of the water on top of them and pull them into the water from the side. These are aggressive powerful animals. They should not be in captivity and humans should not be working closely with them.'
