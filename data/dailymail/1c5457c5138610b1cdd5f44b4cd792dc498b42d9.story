A 'hyper-sexualised' security guard who groped women as he carried out searches at an airport has been jailed after telling one he 'knew she wanted it'.

Married Mark Benson, 51, tried to kiss and grope his victims as he carried out searches at Leeds Bradford Airport and even put his hands inside their clothing.

Leeds Crown Court heard he also made unwanted sexual advances to female members of staff in locker rooms or other staff areas while they were alone.

Benson, from Leeds, West Yorkshire, was jailed for 70 weeks yesterday after pleading guilty to seven offences of sexual assault.

Jon Gregg, prosecuting, said Benson tricked two of his victims into giving him their mobile phone numbers before sending them sexually explicit messages.

He then told one of his victims he 'knew she wanted it' and said he knew of somewhere they could go where there were no CCTV cameras.

The woman told Benson he was old enough to be her father and was married but he still persisted, the court heard.

Mr Gregg said: 'Undaunted by that, he unzipped her coat and tried to undo her blouse buttons.

'All the while she was trying to pull his arm away and mentioning his wife. He said she would never find out.'

The court was told one of Benson's victims had to undergo counselling as a result of her ordeal.

After being arrested, he initially denied the offences and claimed the allegations against him were made up.

Leeds Crown Court heard how Benson also made unwanted sexual advances to female members of staff in while they were alone. He was jailed for 70 weeks and ordered to sign the sex offenders' register for two years

Tony Kellbrick, defending, said: 'For reasons he can't explain he has become hyper-sexualised and he is not willing or able to admit it.

'What I am seeking to do on this defendant's behalf is suggest that, for some obscure reason that he cannot fully understand or accept is that he suddenly thinks he is God's gift to the female half of the race and here he is seeking emotional and sexual attention from them.

'He has lost his job, he has lost his wife and he has lost his home. He is on job seekers allowance. In some ways he is the author of his own downfall.'

Judge Penelope Belcher said the offences could only be met with an immediate custody as they were too serious to be dealt with by a community-punishment.

Benson was also ordered to sign the sex offenders' register for two years.
