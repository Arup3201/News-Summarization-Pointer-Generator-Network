He was asked by a New York-based photographer to name who has most influenced his life.

His answer: 'My principal, Ms Lopez.' Why? Because she 'tells each one of us that we matter'.

Now, Mott Hall Bridge Academy eighth-grader Vidal Chastanet's words have inspired photographer Brandon Stanton to launch a campaign to send students at the middle school to Harvard University.

And the campaign has already far surpassed its initial goal of $100,000 - raising more than $700,000 for the Academy, situated in a 'crime-stricken' Brooklyn neighborhood, in just four days.

Touching response: Vidal was asked by Stanton to name who has most influenced his life. He replied: 'My principal, Ms Lopez'. Above, the photographer posted Vidal's words to his blog, 'Humans of New York'

Inspirational: Referring to Mott Hall's principal, Nadia Lopez (right), Vidal (left) said: 'When we get in trouble, she doesn’t suspend us. She calls us to her office and explains to us how society was built down around us'

Stanton, 30, who runs the popular photo blog, Humans of New York', met Vidal during a photography excursion. He asked the 13-year-old to name the most influential person in his life. 

Referring to his principal, Nadia Lopez, Vidal replied: 'When we get in trouble, she doesn’t suspend us. She calls us to her office and explains to us how society was built down around us.

'And she tells us that each time somebody fails out of school, a new jail cell gets built. And one time she made every student stand up, one at a time, and she told each one of us that we matter.'

Stanton later uploaded a photo of Vidal, alongside his kind words, to his blog. The post gained millions of views and prompted the Manhattan-based photographer to visit Mott Hall.

There, he met Ms Lopez - whom he refers to as 'Superwoman' - and decided  to help send her students to Harvard to 'broaden their horizons and expand their idea of their own potential'.

He set up an Indiegogo page last Thursday with the aim of raising $100,000. On the page, he wrote: 'Mott Hall Bridges Academy is a middle school located in Brownsville, Brooklyn.

'Let's send kids to Harvard': Stanton set up an Indiegogo page (pictured) last Thursday with the aim of raising $100,000. On the page, he wrote: 'Mott Hall Bridges Academy is a middle school located in Brownsville, Brooklyn. The neighborhood [has] the highest crime rate in New York City. It's not the best place to be a kid'

Academy: The photographer's campaign has already far surpassed its initial goal of $100,000 - raising more than $700,000 for the Academy (pictured) in only four days. And the donations continue to come in

Generous donation: One woman, Lesley Charles, donated $30 to the campaign, saying she had been 'inspired' by Mott Hall's students 'to be more purposeful and to value education even more highly than I did before'

'The neighborhood [has] the highest crime rate in New York City. It's not the best place to be a kid. So Principal Nadia Lopez (aka SuperWoman) has a plan for her Brownsville middle schoolers.

'Since many of her scholars have never left New York, she wants them to know what it feels like to stand on the campus of one of the world's top schools, and know that they belong.

'She thinks the experience will broaden their horizons and expand their idea of their own potential.  So let's help her make it happen.'

Stanton also posted a photo of Ms Lopez, 37, from Crown Heights, to the page, alongside her own words: 'This is a neighborhood that doesn't necessarily expect much from our children.

'So at Mott Hall Bridges Academy we set our expectations very high. We don't call the children "students". we call them "scholars".

'When you tell people you're from Brownsville, their face cringes up. But there are children here that need to know that they are expected to succeed.' 

Within just 45 minutes of its launch, the campaign had met its $100,000 goal. As of 9.45am on Monday, it had raised a staggering $700,174.

And the donations are not stopping just yet.

'As a middle school educator, I understand the difference that the outside-of-the-classroom practices make,' one donor wrote on the site. 'I applaud you all for working so hard for these students.' 

Stanton, whose blog features photos of everyday people he meets on the street and has more than eight million followers, told CNN that Vidal's response to his question had deeply touched him.

Crime-stricken area: This post, uploaded on Stanton's blog earlier this month, features another quote by Vidal

Prestigioujs: Mott Hall will use the first $100,000 raised by the campaign - which ends on February 5 - to provide each incoming sixth-grade class annually a chance to visit Harvard (pictured) in Cambridge, Massachusetts

'I ask people all the time about the most influential person in their life. He was the first person who ever told me his principal,' he said.  'When I met Ms. Lopez, I could not have been more impressed.

'She is a force of nature. When she let me sit in on a staff meeting, I got a front-row seat to the challenges that her school faces, and I wanted to be involved in the solution.'

During their meeting, Stanton revealed Vidal had also told him: 'When you live here, you don't have too many fears. You've seen pretty much everything that life can throw at you.

'When I was nine, I saw a guy get pushed off the roof of that building right there.'

Photographer and blogger: Stanton (pictured), whose blog features photos of everyday people he meets on the street and has more than eight million followers, said Vidal's reply to his question had deeply touched him

Mott Hall will use the first $100,000 raised by the campaign - which ends on February 5 - to provide each incoming sixth-grade class annually with a chance to visit Harvard in Cambridge, Massachusetts, the New York Post reported.

The first student trips to Harvard will be in the fall. The Academy, founded by Ms Lopez in 2010, will use funds raised beyond the original goal for summer programming for students.

'Learning stops during the summer for my scholars. We have what is called a "summer slide",' Ms Lopez said. 'They need a safe place where they can do activities and continue to grow their minds.'
