Mary Kidson, 55, was cleared of harming her child by giving her medication that she did not need

A mother cleared of poisoning her daughter with a cocktail of drugs says her case should be used as a landmark ruling for parents who seek alternatives to the NHS.

Mary Kidson was cleared by a jury after a three-week trial at Worcester Crown Court.

The 55-year-old was accused of three counts of unlawfully and maliciously administering drugs, endangering life or inflicting grievous bodily harm, with all the offences alleged to have happened between 2010 and March 2013.

Her daughter, who cannot be named for legal reasons, was given thyroid extract and oestrogen tablets. 

Ms Kidson was arrested in March last year after police searched her £475,000 home in Ledbury, Herefordshire, and found 'a very large amount' of medication. 

Speaking after being released, she said the NHS had a 'monopoly' on child health.

'This whole case raises the question of a parent’s right to go and find treatment outside the NHS for their child.

'Adults have total freedom to go where we want in the world [for healthcare] but when you’re a child it appears that only the NHS can treat you,' she told The Independent.

Her comments come soon after the case of Ashya King,who was at the centre of an international manhunt after his parents took him out of Southampton General Hospital because they believed NHS treatment would have left the five-year-old deaf, blind and brain damaged.

He has spent the last six weeks at the Czech Proton Therapy Centre where he has received 30 sessions of the pioneering treatment which his parents hope will be life-saving. 

Ms Kidson also spoke of her relief after she was cleared.

She said: 'I just sobbed outside in the waiting area. When the verdicts were read it out, it was amazing, absolutely amazing.'

She is now looking forward to being reunited with her daughter, although she does not know when this will happen.

Dr Thierry Hertoghe, the Belgian doctor who treated her, called the whole situation a 'mess' and urged reform to give people the right to choose their doctor without fear of prosecution.

During the three-week trial, prosecutors said she took her daughter 'doctor shopping' for a diagnosis.  

The jury heard how Ms Kidson had, over the years, taken her daughter to several different doctors and put her through a number of assessments to test for an autistic spectrum disorder, speech and language issues and hormonal conditions. 

Prosecutor John Causer told Worcester Crown Court that Kidson had gone from 'doctor to doctor' until she found one who 'told her what she wanted to hear'.

'The daughter's health and emotional well-being we're harmed by being shopped around and saddled with treatment which was harmful to her.

'We're not saying that Mary Kidson set out to harm her daughter or that she is not a loving mother but the consequences of these actions - even of a loving mother - can be very harmful.

'Mrs Kidson has taken her daughter from doctor to doctor until she found one who told her what she wanted to hear.' 

NHS experts told the jury that the girl did not need any of the medication she was taking but the judge told the jury there was no evidence that grievous bodily harm had been caused or that there was a risk to the girl's life.
