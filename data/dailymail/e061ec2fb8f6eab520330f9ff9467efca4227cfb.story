The number of Britons with flu has almost doubled in just two weeks, experts have warned.

So far this winter flu levels have fluctuated but remained relatively low across the UK.

But new figures show that the number of people seeing their GP with symptoms has risen sharply.

An increasing number of people are seeing their GPs with flu-like symptoms

For the week ending February 3, the rate was just under 13 per 100,000,.

But during the week ending February 17, this had risen to just over 22 per 100,000.

In the latest week there were 55 people admitted to intensive care with 
confirmed flu, up from 34 the week before when there were also two 
deaths from the disease.

A total of 517 admissions have been reported across the UK since the beginning of the season along with 57 deaths.

The increase seen in England has not been mirrored in Northern Ireland, Wales or Scotland, the figures from the Health Protection Agency showed.

The flu virus: It's important to cover your mouth and nose when you sneeze or cough to avoid spreading germs

Calls to NHS Direct about flu symptoms remained stable at 1.2 per cent of all calls.

A spokesman for the HPA said: 'Flu continues to circulates in the UK. It is vital that those who are most ‘at risk’ from flu make sure they receive their vaccination as this is the most effective way of preventing them from becoming ill with the virus.

'These ‘at risk’ groups include people with weakened immune systems, those with underlying conditions such as liver, lung or renal diseases, heart problems or diabetes, as well as the over 65s and pregnant women.'

The HPA also expressed the importance of helping to prevent the spread of flu by covering your nose and mouth with a tissue when you cough or sneeze, disposing of the tissue promptly and washing your hands as soon as possible.

Across Europe, particularly in Germany, Luxembourg, Sweden and Belgium, there is substantial flu activity, but the season appears to have peaked in some countries.
