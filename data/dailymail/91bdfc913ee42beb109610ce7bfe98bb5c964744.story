Seven British ski instructors have been arrested in France and were yesterday all facing prison sentences for providing lessons without a licence.

It is all part of an increasingly bitter 'Piste War' which makes a mockery of European Union free labour laws.

Simon Butler, an Englishman who runs a tour business in the resort of Megeve, was snatched off a ski lift by armed French officers on Tuesday, along with his six colleagues.

'They are accused of breaking employment laws', said Bonneville prosecutor Pierre-Yves Michau, who confirmed all were expected in a criminal court within the next two months.

'Mr Butler is not conforming to our laws,' said Mr Michau, who said all those arrested had their passports withdrawn.

Those arrested and held overnight in a police cell were Mr Butler, Mark Gibbs, 63, and Alex Casey, 41. All face charges.

Also arrested and facing charges, but not imprisoned, were Adam Alder-Cox, 21, Philip May, 45, Ross Medcalf, 28, and Jim Wilkins, 47. Jay Blatherwick, a 48-year-old female instructor, was questioned by French police, but not formally arrested.

A furious Mr Butler, who is on bail and due to face a judge on April 7, said: 'I have all the right documentation to work in France, and so do my staff.

'I was arrested illegally and then placed in a tiny, freezing cell with a concrete slab as a bed. I was kept in custody for 36 hours and generally treated appallingly. Now we can't leave the country, and are all facing further time in prison.'

He added: 'The gendarmes and other officials surrounded me and incorrectly accused me of teaching without qualifications. In fact my only real crime was being British and not French.

'I was treated like a criminal instead of someone who is running a successful local business.'

Arrests: Mr Butler was snatched off a ski lift by armed French officers on Tuesday, with his six colleagues

The seven instructors - six men and one woman - face up to three months in prison for working without a licence.

Mr Butler, a highly experienced professional, has worked in Megeve for almost 30 years, mainly with British holidaymakers.

But he claims that he and his staff 
are regularly harassed by the French, who want to maintain their part of
 the Alps as a preserve of mainly local workers.

Ski
 professionals from the UK believe the French are trying to drive them 
off the slopes - so ruining peoples' holidays in the process.

Tensions
 have increased over the past years, as EU employment laws allow more 
and more people to travel and seek work in neighbouring countries.

Outrage: UKIP's Paul Nuttall said, 'Those raging Europhiles who claim there is a single market should read this story and weep'

Mr Butler was first fined the equivalent of around Â£8,000 in 2004 and last year was given a similar fine, together with a six month prison sentence. The latter punishment is currently under appeal.

Mr Butler is also facing charges of failing to declare foreign employees - something he considers 'particularly ridiculous' because France and the UK are EU allies whose nationals are allowed to work in either country without permits.

European Commissioner Michel Barnier, who is also a prominent French MP, devised a Memorandum of Understanding (MOU) as a means of allowing advanced ski instructors to work wherever they want, and it is recognised by the French government.

Mr Butler has a stamp proving that he has
 an MOU, but it is apparently being ignored by the judicial authorities 
in Bonneville, and by the police.

Philippe Planes, Mr Butler's lawyer, confirmed he had 'every right' to operate under a British licence.

'Mr Butler is not a criminal but is being treated as one,' said Mr Planes, who said his client had filed a complaint with the European Commission accusing France of discrimination and restricting his freedom of movement.

When one of Mr Butler's staff was arrested last year, scores of holidaymakers staged a demonstration outside the Megeve police station where he was held.

Commenting on the latest case, UK Independence Party deputy leader Paul Nuttall said: 'Those raging Europhiles who claim there is a single market should read this story and weep.

'They have simply misled people as this episode shows. Simon Butler has been treated like a dog by French authorities because he is a British national who wanted to work as a ski instructor and run a thriving business.'
