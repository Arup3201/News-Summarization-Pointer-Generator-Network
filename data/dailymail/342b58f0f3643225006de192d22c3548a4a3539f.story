Manchester United have told former midfielder Paul Scholes that the door is open for him to return to a coaching role at Old Trafford.

Scholes was part of the coaching set-up at the end of last season as former team-mate Ryan Giggs took over from sacked David Moyes for the final four games in the Barclays Premier League.

Many people thought Scholes had burned his bridges with the club over the summer, though, after criticising some United players in a World Cup column he wrote for a betting company.

Scholes questioned whether Wayne Rooney was already past his best at 28 and why the club had spent Â£30million on defender Luke Shaw.

It is understood, though, that current manager Louis van Gaal and chief executive Ed Woodward still believe the former England star still has something to offer and that Scholes has been told that the club would be happy to talk.

Scholes will not be offered a job with the first team coaching pool as Van Gaal is now happy with this immediate staff.

However, United feel that Scholes could offer the club a great deal by returning to work with young players, possibly alongside current coach Nicky Butt.

'We still value Paul and his qualities very highly,' said a United source.

'As far as we are concerned the door remains open.'
