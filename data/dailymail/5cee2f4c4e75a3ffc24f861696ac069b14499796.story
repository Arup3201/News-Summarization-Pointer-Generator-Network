Suspect: Dale Cregan is being questioned in connection with the killing of PC Nicola Hughes and PC Fiona Bone

Residents living on the estate where double murder suspect Dale Cregan was arrested claim he was spotted in the community several times as he apparently hid from police for a month.

The 29-year-old was seen drinking in pubs and walking around as 'bold as brass' in Hattersley, Tameside, Greater Manchester, witnesses said.

He was arrested on suspicion of murder on Tuesday after policewomen PC Fiona Bone, 32, and PC Nicola Hughes, 23, were killed on the estate.

The policewomen were attacked with a gun and a grenade as they went to investigate a report of a burglary.

Today questions remained about why, despite the sightings, police were not alerted to Cregan's presence.

Police had offered a £50,000 reward for information leading to his arrest in connection with alleged crimes.

A middle-aged man, who would only give his name as Tom, told the Daily Mirror that he had seen Cregan 'a few times'.

'I saw him in the local a few weeks back,' he said. 'Didn’t say anything obviously. You assume the police are on to it, or it’s been straightened.'

Another resident, aged in her thirties, claimed that Cregan had been seen walking about the estate 'bold as brass'.

The revelations come a day after one of Britain's top police officers condemned a 'worrying' conspiracy by a minority in Manchester who aided and protected Cregan.

Sir Hugh Orde, the Association of Chief Police Officers, said the situation mirrored what he experienced in Northern Ireland, where he ran policing for seven years, whose communities had in the past protected suspected terrorists and criminals.

A culture of fear was used to stop people with information speaking to police, no matter how high the cash rewards for information were, he said.
