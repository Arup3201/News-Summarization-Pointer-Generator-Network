A devoted couple succumbed to carbon monoxide poisoning after toxic fumes from a faulty fireplace filled their home.

Grandparents Leslie Cox, 58, and Pamela Cox, 56, were discovered lying lifeless in each other's arms on a sofa by their sons last November.

The couple, from Wickford in Essex, lit the smokeless coal fire for the first time that winter, unaware that the chimney flue had become blocked and that deadly fumes were filling their home.

Mr Cox had attended Basildon Hospital A&E two days before he died, complaining of feeling 'dizzy, nauseous, and disorientated'.

Mr Cox, a thermal insulation engineer, had complained of an inner ear condition, which was diagnosed following treatment.

At the inquest into the deaths held in Chelmsford today Coroner Mrs Caroline Beasley-Murray described the incident as a 'tragic accident' and recorded a verdict of accidental death.

Police investigations revealed a blocked chimney flue above a smokeless coal fire in the living room was to blame for filling the house with toxic fumes.

The couple had lit the fire on Thursday evening and had left it lit for two nights before succumbing to the lethal fumes.

The pair were found cuddled up in front of the television by their two sons on the Sunday morning after failing to answer concerned calls.

A post-mortem revealed Mr Cox’s blood carbon dioxide haemoglobin level was at a lethal 58 per cent while his wife’s had reached 65 per cent.

Mrs Beasley-Murray refused to condemn hospital staff for not spotting the symptoms of carbon monoxide poisoning when the couple visited just days before the fatal incident.

Concluding she said: 'In the light of all the evidence I will record a verdict that the cause of death was carbon monoxide poisoning.

Carbon monoxide (CO) is a colourless, odourless, poisonous gas produced by incomplete burning of carbon-based fuels, including gas, oil, wood and coal.

When CO enters the body, it prevents the blood from bringing oxygen to cells, tissues, and organs.

Around 15 people die from CO poisoning each year in the UK - according to the Heath Safety Executive.

Symptoms of  include headaches or dizziness, breathlessness, nausea, loss of consciousness and tiredness.

Carbon Monoxide can be produced by any combustion appliance, including those that burn fossil fuels e.g. oil, wood and coal.

If you have one of these appliances you should make sure that it is serviced and maintained by a competent person and the chimney is regularly swept.

'It is very clear the cause of death was as a result of combustion products building up in the flume.

'Leslie and Pamela died as a result of a tragic accident.

'It is very good that there are so many representatives from the press here today.

'I would like a warning to be given that any appliance which produces products of combustion must be well maintained and regularly serviced.'

Sons, Ian Cox, 32, and Neil Cox, 34, attended the inquest with their partners and called on more to be done to save other families from falling victim to what they described as a ‘silent killer’.

Neil, a legionella risk assessor, said: 'We don’t blame the hospital as the symptoms our parents showed are very common but it took the ambulance staff two minutes to test us.

'Surely if ambulances have that sort of test then it should be made available in hospitals.

'Everyone must be made aware of the dangers of carbon monoxide poisoning - it is truly a silent killer.'

Ian, a thermal insulation engineer, added: 'You see smoke alarms in the news all the time but carbon monoxide alarms don’t seem to get enough promotion - it should be compulsory for every house to have one.

'For the sake of £25 you can save a life.'

The stark warning is one which has already spread across their home town of Wickford, Essex, where carbon monoxide alarms sold out at all stores in the area within a week of residents hearing about the tragic accident.

Remembering his parents, Ian said: 'They were loved by everyone and everyone loved them.

'Losing them has left a huge hole in our lives - a hole no one will ever be able to fill.

'No one should have to find their parents like we did.

'We just want to prevent anyone else going through what we have gone through.'

The couple had lived happily at their £200,000 terraced property in Wickford, Essex, since marrying back in 1975.

They enjoyed holidaying at their caravan in Clacton, Essex, and had been planning their retirement when they died on Sunday, November 6 last year 2011.

The couple had three grandchildren - the youngest was just three weeks old when tragedy struck the family.

Describing the scene the pair were confronted with when they entered the family home that Sunday morning, Neil said: 'We couldn’t get hold of mum and dad so we both came round and found them cuddled up together on the settee.

'They both looked so happy and peaceful - there were still leftover prawns from the meal they had had the night before.

'The only comfort we have found throughout this nightmare is knowing our parents didn’t suffer when they passed away.'

Basildon Hospital have failed to comment on the deaths.
