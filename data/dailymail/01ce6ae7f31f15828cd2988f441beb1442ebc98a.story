The quadruple amputee on the run after the November 4 murder of both his parents killed himself Monday night during a routine Memphis traffic stop.

Sean Petrozzino was over 800 miles from his slain parents' Orlando home when he made an illegal u-turn that caught the attention of Tennessee cops, reports WMC.

As those officers approached Petrozzino's father's missing red Toyota, they heard a gun discharge. In side the car was the body of the handless, legless 30-year-old.

Petrozinno was Orange County, Florida investigators' only 'person of interest' in the murder of school teacher Nancy Petrozzino, 54, and Disney World employee Michael Petrozzino, 63, reports the Orlando Sentinel. 

He was never named as a suspect but police warned the public he was armed and possibly dangerous as he made his way out of Orange County.

It was initially believed that Petrozzino might have been heading south toward Southern Florida last week. 

Presumably what was the final photo taken of Petrozzino was at an Orlando ATM, where he withdrew cash around the time of his parents' death. 

The Orange County Sheriff's Office said just before noon Tuesday that Memphis authorities had not yet confirmed Petrozzino's death, thus it remained unknown whether the murder investigation would continue.

Petrozzino's inspirational battle with the disease made the headlines when he was a teenager with news crews visiting him in hospital and during events. 

Recent posts on social media suggests he and his family were happy. Some pictures were taken at Disney World where his father worked. 

But earlier this year he broke up with his wife Cynthia and moved in with his parents only a week before they were found dead. 

Soon after making the gruesome discovery, the Orange County Sheriff's Office held a press conference, asking about the whereabouts of the couple's son Sean Petrozzino, 30. 

They said he may be driving a red Toyota with a license plate number of 112VZY, which neighbors say is his father's car. 

Sean and his great Dane moved back in with his parents last week after separating from his wife. The former couple's home in Georgia is allegedly in foreclosure.

Sean is also a quadruple amputee after a teenage bout with bacterial meningitis. In 2000, he underwent 13 surgeries to remove the infection which resulted in the loss of both his legs and he only has part of one hand left.  He is able to walk with the use of prosthetic limbs.

'I've known Sean since he was 16 years old,' mother in law Cathleen Horne told the Sentinel. 'This just seems bizarre. It seems like a bad dream.'

'We met Sean about a week-and-a-half ago,' neighbor Richard Ellwood told My Fox Orlando. 'He was introduced to me by Nancy as their son.'

Mr Ellwood went on to describe the couple as nice people who had lived in the neighborhood for several years. 

'It's difficult to imagine someone who would have that much rage, whoever did this,' he told WKMG.

The Orlando Sentinel spoke to Jerry L. Saunders of ABC Prosthetics and Orthotics, who verified that handless people indeed have the ability to fire a weapon.

It's also known that Sean Petrozzino is able to manage other finer tasks such as using an ATM. 

Police verified this late Wednesday when they released surveillance footage of Petrozzino as he used an Orlando cash machine on Tuesday, most likely after his parents were slain.

What's more, police are searching for Petrozzino as he's thought to potentially be on his way to South Florida and behind the wheel of his father's red Toyota.
