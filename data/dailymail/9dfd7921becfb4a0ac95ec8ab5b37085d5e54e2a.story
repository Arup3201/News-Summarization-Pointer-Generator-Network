If Roger Federer truly is past it, then Milos Raonic must have felt like he stepped into a time machine and travelled back a few years last night.

By the end of the first game, the 23-year-old had already seen his huge serve broken. By the end of the second set he looked like a broken man. Thirty-three minutes later he was out of the gentleman’s singles, the uprising of youth obliterated by one of the oldest swingers in town.

What happens next, in a Wimbledon final against Novak Djokovic, remains to be seen for a man one month shy of his 33rd birthday. What can be in no doubt is that those directing Federer towards pasture will need to take a break. Perhaps they need a lie down.

How romantic that after two years 
without a Grand Slam - some of it spent in an undignified, unrequested 
position of pity - Federer finds himself on the cusp of becoming the 
oldest male winner of Wimbledon in the open era. A record eighth title 
here, a notion that seemed increasingly implausible this time a year 
ago, is now one match away.

‘I'm
 unbelievably thrilled to be in another final,’ he said. ‘I was very 
pleased the way I played because it was always going to be a difficult 
match against Milos.

‘The 
fun for me is being able to do it, at this age, with a family, with the 
team I have. We have a great relationship. I know so many people over 
time now on the tour, so being here, doing this, is something I really, 
really enjoy.

‘I
 am extremely happy. I will try to enjoy it as much as I can. The first 
final was special in 2003 and it has been a thrill ever since. To get 
another chance is great. Novak and I have had many great matches.’

If
 his win yesterday, and indeed his wider revival in 2014, proved 
anything it is that while the old back might not be what it once was, 
the maestro with four children in tow can still play a handy tune.

Of
 course, the obituaries were premature in the extreme and, by extension,
 a measure of context is needed when rating the scale of his comeback 
this year.

By
 his own admission, 2013 was ‘difficult’; woeful in the minds of most 
who saw some of the defeats. He had a serious back injury and his lowest
 haul of titles since 2001 – one. His ranking fell to eighth.  

Worse
 still, in the two years since he won here there has been a spreading of
 the opinion that the mounting losses would damage his legacy. A 
ludicrous sentiment but a popular one.

‘I don't even remember when my last Grand Slam final was,’ Federer joked last night. 

Certainly,
 this is no fairytale. He has been too good for too long to count as a 
true outsider, particular with grass under his feet.

But it is an 
astonishing achievement and one given greater stature by the numbers 
that show only eight Slams have been won by fathers since 1990. None 
have been won in that time by a father of four.

Then again, Federer is the man who has made an estimated fortune of £140million by breaking records.

Yesterday
 he took a step to more by breaking serves. This was a win that owed 
much to experience and a keen sense for when Raonic was vulnerable.

At
 the slightest sign of weakness, Federer ran away with the game. His 
three breaks of serve – twice to 15 points and once to 30 – were notable
 against a man broken only twice in five previous matches.

The
 first break came in the opening game. Raonic walked with his head down 
to the chair, picking at his strings; Federer strutted, brushing back 
his hair, calmness personified. He never looked back in taking the 
opening set 6-4 in 34 minutes.

At
 that point, there were no smiles, unlike Thursday when he traded 
high-fives with some of the hundreds who watched him practice on Court 
4. There was simply that single fist salute so familiar to those who saw
 him dominate this competition for a decade.

There was another when he broke at 4-4 in the second and at the same stage in the third.

Raonic, close to the front of the ‘new wave’ of men’s tennis, was left shaking his head.

‘Roger
 is the guy that's done a lot of things that don't seem possible,’ he 
said. ‘A lot of people could have, and have, written him off in a lot of
 ways. But you knew he was capable of this run.’

It’s not over yet.
