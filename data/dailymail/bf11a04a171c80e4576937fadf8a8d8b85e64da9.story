McDonald's Japan has
apologised to customers and vowed to ensure product safety after
objects including a tooth and plastic were found in its food.

The food safety scandal comes as the fast-food chain is hit by sliding sales and a shortage of french fries caused by a labour dispute.

McDonald's Japan is on track to record its sixth straight year of sales declines and its first annual loss in 11 years. Convenience stores in particular have drawn away customers with broader ranges of ready-made meals and low-priced coffee.

McDonald's Japan has apologised to customers and vowed to ensure product safety afterobjects including a tooth and plastic were found in its food

Today's apology came after a diner found a roughly 1 1/2 inch strip of vinyl in a Chicken McNugget at the
weekend. 

That prompted the chain to halt sales of nuggets made
on the same day as the contaminated item at a plant in Thailand.
The company is still investigating the cause.

Other incidents that have damaged the restaurants brand include the discovery of a human tooth in a french fry in August, and a child cutting its mouth on a piece of plastic in a sundae in December.  

McDonald's sought to reassure the public about its standards at a news conference with Takehiko Aoki, senior vice president at McDonald's Holding Co (Japan) Ltd, saying he was 'confident that my family can eat McDonald's products'.

Mr Aoki said the believed the company's response to the food safety scare had been 'appropriate'.  

McDonald's Japan began sourcing nuggets from three
Thai plants less than six months ago. The change was aimed at
boosting confidence in product quality after Chinese supplier
Shanghai Husi Food Co Ltd was accused of selling expired meat.

The Thai plant that produced the nugget containing vinyl is located in Saraburi and is owned by Cargill, who have not commented on the incident.

On Monday, just days after the latest discovery, McDonald's
Japan resumed sales of all sizes of french fries for the first
time in three weeks. A labour dispute at U.S. West Coast ports
had delayed imports, forcing the company to ration portions. 

Meanwhile, McDonald's fans in Venezuela are still waiting for french fries to return to their menus.

The imports delays in the U.S. comes as
socialist Venezuela grapples with shortfalls of basic goods
ranging from medicines to flour due to strict currency controls
that stymie imports.

McDonald's restaurants are coping by replacing the spuds
with salad or local fare such as fried yuca or 'arepa' corn
pancakes - but it's no happy meal for McDonald's fans. 

Two cashiers at separate restaurants said fries had been
missing for two weeks and that business had dropped as a result.  

Arcos Dorados S.A., McDonald's Corp's key operator
in Latin America, did not reply to queries about whether
Venezuela's Byzantine three-tiered exchange rate system was to
blame.

French fries only became available again in Japan on Monday after a three week absence caused by a labour dispute at U.S. West Coast ports, and they are still off the menu in Venezuela 

But the company's senior director for corporate communications, Sonia Ruseler said the shortage was down to a 'temporary issue with distribution which we are trying to solve'. 

A protracted labor dispute at U.S. West Coast ports forced
McDonald's to ration fries in Japan last year.

Fries sold at McDonald's restaurants in Latin America are
imported from Argentina, Canada or the United States, according
to Ms Ruseler.

Weary Venezuelans were quick to blame the country's currency
controls, implemented more than a decade ago to stem capital
flight and viewed as the root of the current economic crisis.

'Fries are definitely imported and there are no dollars to
bring them in,' said Patricia, whose granddaughter, Arantxa, ran
off to play when she learned there were no fries on offer.

'A month ago we came and she did eat, because there were
fries,' said Patricia, who declined to give her last name.
