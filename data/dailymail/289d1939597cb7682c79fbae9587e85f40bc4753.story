Jon Corzine has admitted he has no idea where $1.2billion of missing customer’s money has gone since his brokerage firm collapsed.

The former chief of MF Global has apologised to customers, employees and investors, saying ‘their plight weighs on my mind every hour’.

But politicians and regulators have slammed the former New Jersey governor’s firm for operating as if the recession never happened.

‘I simply do not know where the money is, or why the accounts have not been reconciled to date,’ he told the House Agriculture Committee.

‘Their plight weighs on my mind every day - every hour,’ the former U.S. senator said in 21 pages of remarks prepared for delivery on Thursday.

It is the first time Mr Corzine, 64, has spoken out since MF Global went bankrupt in October due to poor bets on European sovereign debt.

He resigned just days later and the 
search for the missing customer funds has sent reverberations through 
the farm belt and trading floors.

It has also attracted the attention of the FBI and federal prosecutors, with thousands of customers having their money frozen.

‘It appears to me that nobody has learned a thing from what's gone on here,’ said the Committee’s top Democrat, Collin Peterson.

‘Wall Street is operating as if 2008 never happened.’

A top executive of futures exchange operator CME Group said claimed Global misused hundreds of millions of dollars of customer funds.

In the strongest accusation yet against the bankrupt futures brokerage, the CME executive said MF Global moved the money to its own accounts.

The biggest U.S. futures exchange operator was a hands-on regulator of MF Global. Its executive chairman Terrence Duffy also gave prepared remarks.

‘Transfers of customer funds for the benefit of the firm constitute serious violations of our rules and of the Commodity Exchange Act,’ he said.

He said the brokerage admitted during a call with regulators that customer money was transferred out of segregation to the firm's own accounts.

The court-appointed trustee has estimated
 the shortfall of customer money at $1.2 billion, but CME has disputed 
that figure as being too high.

Mr Duffy indicated the shortfall was roughly half that amount. But neither MF Global nor any of its executives has been charged with wrongdoing.

Mr Corzine admitted in testimony that he mistakenly thought ‘investments in short-term European debt securities were prudent’.

But he added that his ‘involvement in the firm's clearing, settlement and payment mechanisms and accounting was limited’.

‘I was stunned when I was told on Sunday, October 30, 2011, that MF Global could not account for many hundreds of millions of dollars,’ he said.
