A Philadelphia murder suspect was killed yesterday and his accomplice stepbrother injured in a dramatic shoot out with police.

FBI agents and Philadelphia police officers called in a SWAT team to surround a house in the East Mount Airy neighborhood of the city after learning Tevin Hammond, 21, and Justin Mackie, 19, had moved in. The brothers were wanted in connection with six homicides, shootings and armed robberies throughout Philadelphia.

The two men were confronted at approximately 1:15 p.m. on Monday and tried to run before shooting at law enforcement officers, police said.

'They tried to flee at the backdoor,' Philadelphia Police Chief Inspector Dennis Wilson told NBC News.

'Both had guns and shot at the police. Police returned fire.'

Wilson said Hammond was shot and killed in a nearby alley while Mackie was struck five times. He was rushed to Einstein Hospital in critical condition but as of 3:30 p.m. was listed as in stable condition.

No law enforcement officers were hurt and one of the suspect's guns was recovered at the scene.

The pair, according to police, were accused of a string of grizzly murders and armed robberies committed recently across Philadelphia.

Police recently put out a wanted 
poster for Mackie after obtaining an arrest warrant for him in 
connection with last Monday's shooting homicide of Tyrone Hayes, 20.

Hayes was killed in the courtyard of a North Philadelphia apartment complex.

Mackie
is also wanted in the robbery and shooting of cab driver and jazz 
singer 53-year-old William Carney III back on June 4. Carney survived 
after he drove himself to the hospital.

'I
picked them up,' Carney told NBC. 'I thought they were regular 
customers. At they end of the ride they pulled the pistol out on me. It 
seemed like they really wanted to kill me.'

Doctors told Carney he almost didn't make it.

'They said if I hadn't tied the tourniquet on my own arm after the shooting that I would have bled out. So I'm really grateful that didn't happen.'

According to Philly.com, Hammond was found guilty on a drug-dealing charge in 2012 and sentenced to five years' probation.

His younger brother, Mackie, was arrested in September 2011 for robbery, kidnapping, possession of an instrument of crime and several related offenses. He was released from jail after he posted 10 per cent of $50,000 bail.
