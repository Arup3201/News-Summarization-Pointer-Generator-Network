A 70-year-old man reveals his peculiar penchant for wearing rubber and silicone bodysuits to resemble a female blow-up doll in the upcoming season of My Strange Addiction.

Robert, a divorced property developer who lives in Newport Beach, California, with his 19-year-old daughter, is part of a growing community of 'maskers.'

For Robert, dressing as his female alter-ego 'Sherry' is a dedicated passion. He has been slipping into his skin-tight suits - which come with eerie matching masks - for 12 years.

In a preview clip for the upcoming hour-long episode, Robert is seen dusting himself in baby powder as he prepares to don his Sherry costume.

'That's why I do this,’ Robert breathes as he pouts at his reflection in the bathroom mirror, ‘because I think I look amazing.'

He continues: ‘I just can't believe that's a 70-year-old man in the mirror and that's why I do this. If I saw a 70-year-old man in the mirror I would quit this tomorrow.'

Asked what he sees when he looks at his dolled-up reflection, Robert replies: 'An exciting looking female. If I saw a woman like this and she asked me to go hang out, I'd say yeah.'

Robert is not the subject's real name, nor is his face revealed, but he has a cult following on Facebook, where he regularly posts photos of himself as Sherry in an array of sexualized poses. 

He has also appeared in a British Channel 4 documentary, Secrets of the Living Dolls, which screened earlier this year.

As the show revealed, the appeal of Sherry seems to lie partly in the fact that  dating real women has been something of a disappointment.

‘You see, after all, I'm 70 years old and I've tried dating, and when I'm dating, the women I meet are generally 55 to well up into their 60s,’ he explained.

‘Some of them are in really good shape for their age but they don't look anything like this and it's very difficult to date when you have this to come home to.’

Not a phase: For Robert, becoming his female alter-ego 'Sherry' is a dedicated passion. He has been slipping into his skin-tight suits - which come with eerie matching masks - for 12 years now

Asked by The Daily Beast earlier this year where he thinks his obsession sprung from, Robert admits he can't work it out. 

'I wish to hell I knew,' he told the website. 'I don’t know what it is, why I started doing it, why I continue doing it, or why it’s become such a compulsion.'

Robert is just one of the stars who offer a glimpse into their strange and unique lifestyles in the upcoming series of the hit TLC show.

Other subjects include Patrice, a 29-year-old married woman from London who has been addicted to eating bricks for the past 12 years.

Patrice's addiction is so intense that she once chewed a two-foot hole in the wall of her bedroom, and has consumed parts of her grandmother's home in secret.

Priorities: He claims that because similar-aged women don't look anything like Sherry, 'it's very difficult... when you have this to come home to'

Another subject is Linda, a 56-year-old woman who has been 'happily married' to 'Bruce' - a 70-foot carnival ride - for three years. 

Linda is a self-proclaimed objectum sexual, which means she has romantic feelings for inanimate objects.

Also set to appear is Kyle, a 31-year-old man with an addiction to dating elderly women; as well as Evelyn, who is so hooked on drinking air freshener, she sprays mouthfuls of it at least 50 times a day.

My Strange Addiction's new season airs Wednesday, January 7 at 10/9c on TLC.
