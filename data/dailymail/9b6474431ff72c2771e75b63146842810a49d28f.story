Sixteen people have been arrested and seven of them charged with fraud after allegedly targeting elderly and vulnerable people in a £1million rogue trading scam.

Kent and Essex Serious Crime Directorate launched an investigation in December into reports an organised crime gang was cold calling people in the Clacton area of Essex.

Seven people were charged last night 
with one count of conspiracy to commit fraud by false representation 
between 2009 and 2013. The charges relate to work carried out on 
victims’ homes at inflated prices.

The seven month investigation is believed to be one of the biggest in England and Wales into conspiracies targeting elderly people.

Sixteen people have been arrested after seven month investigation into an alleged £1million rogue trading scam

About 39 people, aged 65 and 99, are believed to have fallen victim to an organised gang and were together conned out of hundreds of thousands of pounds.

A team of 65 officers were involved as suspects were arrested at addresses in the Colchester and Clacton areas yesterday.

Unemployed William Brown, 48, of Colchester, and company director James Brown, 20, of Tiptree, have also been charged with one count of blackmail and one count of conspiracy to conceal criminal property.

Unemployed Peter Biddle, 66, of Ardleigh; builder Van Purdy, 59, of Ardleigh; and pawnbroker Harvey White, 48, of Clacton, were all also charged with one count of conspiracy to conceal criminal property.

The suspects were arrested on suspicion of 
crimes including conspiracy to commit fraud, conspiracy to commit money 
laundering, and suspicion of money laundering

Builder James Brown, 44, of Stanway, was also charged with one count of blackmail, one count of conspiracy to conceal criminal property and one count of fraud by false representation.

All six men have been detained in police custody prior to their appearances at Colchester Magistrates’ Court later today.

Nurse Rachel Poole, 47, of Bromley 
Road, Ardleigh, has been released on police bail until her first court 
appearance on July 16 when she will face the main charge of conspiracy 
to commit fraud.

The remaining nine arrested people, 
aged between 26 and 62 and from the Epping, Colchester and Clacton 
areas, have been released on police bail until next Wednesday.

Gary Beautridge, Essex Police assistant
chief constable, said: 'Over the past seven months my officers have 
been investigating a series of cases which appear to be the work of an 
organised crime group taking advantage of the elderly and vulnerable and
exploiting them for criminal gain.

'The offences we are looking at basically amount to the financial abuse of the most vulnerable members of our society.

'The
evidence would suggest that these vulnerable people have been groomed 
and then preyed upon by a group whose sole intention appears to be to 
line their own pockets.'

The force said it had been working with Essex County Council’s trading standards and adult social care departments.

Police have arrested six men on suspicion of conspiracy to commit fraud and conspiracy to commit money laundering, one woman and one man on suspicion of conspiracy to commit money laundering, and seven people on suspicion of money laundering.

The suspects are all in custody in police stations in north Essex.

Following the arrests, police and trading standards warned residents not to have work carried out by people knocking on their door and instead seek quotes from reputable tradesmen.

Essex County Council today said rogue doorstep traders can be extremely persuasive and target elderly and vulnerable people.

Essex County Councillor Roger Walters, cabinet member for trading standards said: 'The arrests today demonstrate that we will not tolerate the unacceptable and abhorrent behaviour of those who prey on the most vulnerable members of our community.

'It is through vigilant work by trading standards officers and Essex Police that means we can identify rogue trading, act upon evidence and hopefully stamp out this activity across Essex.'

He added: 'Rogue doorstep can be very 
convincing and it is easy to be taken in.

'We would urge people to recognise the
risk of buying services from people who call at their door and look to 
recommended traders instead.'
