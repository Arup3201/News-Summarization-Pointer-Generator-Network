A horror fan dressed as a zombie and covered in fake blood sparked a police hunt after terrified children called 999 - convinced he had been attacked.

Horror movie fan Jonathan Lockett, 17, was posing for his make-up artist sister Chantelle Delaney who had decked him out in gruesome looking injuries for a photoshoot in Cheshire.

But when she started taking pictures of her brother on the street, two children playing nearby thought Jonathan's make-up was real and called police in a panic.

Horror movie fan Jonathan Lockett, 17,  was so convincing in his make-up artist by sister Chantelle Delaney that two children called police 

His sister had decked him out in fake blood and gruesome looking injuries for a photoshoot in Cheshire

But when she started taking pictures of her brother outside a social club, two children playing nearby thought Jonathan's make up was real and mistakenly called police thinking that he had been attacked

Two officers dashed to the scene to question the pair but let them go when they realised there been a misunderstanding.

Chantelle, 23, from Warrington, Cheshire, who has recently completed a course in media and make-up at Warrington Collegiate, said: 'I couldn't believe it when the officers approached me and told me what had happened.

'They had received a report of a badly injured man in the area and assumed the worst. I was shocked at first but now I feel quite flattering to think the makeup looked so real.

During the makeover Jonathan had fake blood spattered over a white shirt and was made up to look as if he had suffered horrific gashes across his face, with part of his cheek missing.

The makeup started with latex, around half an hour of drying and wax to recreate gashes.

Chantelle then added fake blood and mud to finish before the pair went to Penketh Social Club to take photographs of her work.

She said: 'My plan was to make Jonathan look as terrifying as possible and the whole make-up process took about an hour.

'I have to say I myself couldn't even bear to look at him when I had finished, it gave me the chills - I suppose that's the sign of a good make-up artist.

'I found the perfect setting for the shoot, across the road from my mum's house in a disused building. We got a couple of strange looks from people as we were walking over but I never thought that people would think that Jonathan's make-up was real.

'It's all boarded up at the back of the club so we went there and I just asked my brother to walk around to get some action shots. Then all of a sudden these two police officers started to walk towards us and I was worried I was going to get in trouble because it's private land.

'They then said a couple of kids had just seen my brother walking around like a zombie and presumed he had been injured in some kind of assault. The kids only looked about eight and they were too scared to look at him.

The pair are pictured without make-up on. Chantelle said: 'I still have to finish my portfolio but I am now confident of my skills. I will just have to make sure my shoots are done indoors now and away from the public'

'I didn't know what to say, I was lost for words - by this point a crowd had gathered and I remembered two young boys crying as Jonathan looked so scary. Thankfully the police had a laugh and a joke about it too.

'I know this sounds bad but I was actually delighted to get the reaction I did - I just feel bad that I scared a couple of kids in the process. If I can make someone believe that my brother was a zombie then my work here is done.'

Sgt Mark Naylor of Cheshire Police said: 'On our arrival, it was clear that there was indeed a male wearing torn clothing, who was covered in blood and appeared to have a severe facial injury and who was stood with a female.

'Unfortunately for them, some houses overlooked the building and the occupants had phoned the police. The make-up was extremely effective and would not have looked out of place on The Walking Dead.'
