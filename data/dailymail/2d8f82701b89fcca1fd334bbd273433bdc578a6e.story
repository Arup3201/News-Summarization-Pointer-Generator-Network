A surfer who survived a shark attack off the coast of California over the weekend has vowed to hit the waves again as soon as doctors let him.

Kevin Swanson of Morro Bay was on his board near the Montaña de Oro State Park, which is 200 miles north of Los Angeles, when he was bitten by the 10ft animal.

It had swum underneath the 50-year-old's board, dug teeth into his hip and then dragged him under the water. Mr Swanson was submerged for a several seconds, before resurfacing and yelling 'shark attack'.

He then paddled back to the beach where he created a tourniquet for his leg using the leash on his surfboard.

Mr Swanson told Key-tv3 that he was 'lucky to be alive, no doubt about that', following the attack on Sunday.

Mr Swanson said the shark attack wouldn't keep him out of the water, saying: 'As soon as the doctor gives me the green light I'll be going back out there and I'll probably be hesitant to paddle out to the same spot, but I'll eventually be out there as well.' 

He said the moment he was pulled under the water, 'everything changed dramatically'.

'It went from calm, serene, beautiful day with your friends to violent.'

Mr Swason estimated the shark dragged him about 5-10 feet below the surface.  

Swanson underwent surgery at Sierra Vista Regional Medical Centre for a laceration to his right leg, he said was as big as a pie tin.

The shark had swum underneath the 50-year-old's board, grazed his hip and then dragged him under the water. A picture of his board shows bite marks next to the tail fins

He said: 'It looked like something that would never get put back together again.'

Before Mr Swanson was flown to Sierra Vista Regional Medical Center, two doctors that happened to be on the beach who helped treat his injury. 

He said: 'Without them who knows. I may have gone into shock without them there.' 

The authorities did not close the beach as a result of the attack, but instead sent out notifications to others in the area.
