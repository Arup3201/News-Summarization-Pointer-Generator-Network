If it took a year and ten months to build the warship Sovereign of the Seas in the 17th century, how long would it take to make a 1:84 scale model today?

The answer, astonishingly, is two years and seven months – nine months longer than shipwrights took over the original, which was the largest vessel of her time.

It will also cost £804.65 for 135 issues of a new weekly magazine showing how to create the 110cm-long replica of the wooden Navy ship commissioned by Charles I and launched in 1637.

Readers will have to buy 135 issues if they want to build the entire ship

The magazine will be launched at an introductory price of £1.99 but will cost £5.99 thereafter

The magazine – which has been widely advertised on TV – costs £1.99 for the first issue, then £5.99 per copy after that. Its website says: ‘HMS Sovereign of the Seas is a new magazine that comes  complete with all the parts to build a stunning model of the most powerful warship of the 17th century.’

But a spokesman for pressure group Consumer Focus said: ‘The cost of these magazines can really mount up.

‘Before taking on a long-running 
subscription to make a ship or anything else, people should work out the
final cost and decide whether they feel that is worth paying.’

The magazine series includes detailed images showing how to put together the masts, rigging, guns and anchors.

The
first edition details the origins of the ship in Chatham Dockyard and 
includes a cannon and the first parts of the hull. The finished model is
90cm high and 40cm wide.

Rashid
Lalloo of Premier Ship Models, who has run his model ship-making 
website for ten years, said you could buy a similar model ready-made for
around £300.

He added: ‘Enthusiasts can buy a complete Sovereign of the Seas kit from a shop and complete it in a few months.’

HMS Sovereign of the Seas cost £65,586 when it was built which is the equivalent of £8million today

A
spokesman for DeAgostini, the firm behind the magazine, said: ‘This 
type of partwork provides for a niche modelling audience a very 
high-quality model in easy to manage parts. It is a tried and tested 
formula much appreciated by our loyal modelling fans and allows 
DeAgostini to create and develop beautiful ships to a degree of detail 
and scale that is not normally available in the High Street.’

Sovereign of the Seas was the most magnificent ship of her era, with no expense spared during  her construction. The £65,586 cost is the equivalent of around £8million today.

She was the first ship to have three full gun decks, carrying 102 guns on the orders of the King, instead of the 90 originally planned. All her guns were made from bronze instead of cast iron, which meant they were much lighter but four times more expensive.

Sovereign was known by Britain’s enemies as the Golden Devil because of her stunning black and gold colouring.

Her first engagement was the  Battle of Kentish Knock, fought in the North Sea during the First Dutch War in September 1652.

Her career ended when she accidentally caught fire at Chatham, Kent, in January 1696.
