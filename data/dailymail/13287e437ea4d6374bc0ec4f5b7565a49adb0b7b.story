A jockey has sustained two punctured lungs after being kicked by horses following a fall at the Cheltenham Festival.

Tom Weston, who is an amateur rider, was airlifted to the hospital on Thursday after falling off Benbane Head and getting kicked by several following horses toward the end of the Fulke Walwyn Kim Muir Challenge Cup.

Martin Keighley, trainer of Benbane Head, says Weston will be in intensive care for two days and does not have any head injuries, which was the main concern.

Jockey JT McNamara was paralyzed after a fall in the same race two years ago.
