A Labour MP bidding to replace Boris Johnson as London Mayor has accused the party of trying to 'out-kip Ukip' with an 'inflammatory' leaflet on immigration.

David Lammy today hit out at the flier trumpeting Labour's 'tough new approach to immigration' which boasted that the party would stop migrants claiming benefits until they have lived in the UK for two years.

Mr Lammy, 42, said he had been contacted by constituents infuriated by the 'inflammatory rhetoric' used in the election leaflet.

The Tottenham MP, who is running for Mayor next year, tweeted a picture of the official Labour leaflet, which pledges to make foreign frontline staff speak English.

But Mr Lammy said: 'We're a pro-immigration party: let's not race to the bottom trying to out-kip UKIP.'

Today he accused his party of presenting a 'caricature' of foreign nurses who could not speak English.

He told the Evening Standard: 'We should be strongly defending the importance of immigration and explaining how much this city in particular benefits from it.'

The intervention comes after he confirmed that he would be seeking Labour's nomination in the race to replace Mr Johnson – who will fight to re-join the House of Commons in May.

Mr Lammy added: 'We should be arguing that London's diversity and cosmopolitanism are part of what makes it great.

'We are a pro-immigration party and we should stay that way, engaging in the debate on immigration but not on Ukip's terms.

'What we should not be doing is taking part in a race to the bottom with the Tories and with Ukip to see who can come up with the toughest rhetoric on immigration I will be making the case for immigration strongly and proudly in the coming months.'

But a Labour spokesman defended the message of the leaflet and said Labour want to address voters' 'real concerns' over mass immigration.

He added: 'This includes plans for tougher border controls, preventing employers undercutting wages and banning agencies from only recruiting abroad - setting out new rules that are both tough and fair.'

Mr Lammy was born in Tottenham, north London, to Guyanese parents.

He and his four siblings were brought up by his mother after his father walked out when he was 12.

At 10, he won a choral scholarship to The King's School, Peterborough. He studied at the School of Oriental and African Studies, University of London, and at Harvard Law School, where he became friends with Barack Obama.

He entered Parliament at the age of 27 and was tipped as a future Labour leader, but failed to make it to the Cabinet after a tough time as a junior minister.
