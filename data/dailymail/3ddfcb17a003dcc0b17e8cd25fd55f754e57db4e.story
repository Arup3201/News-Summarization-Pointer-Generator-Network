It was the premier destination for Sydney's elite hoping to see, be seen and escape the city when it opened in the early 1900s, playing host to some of Australia's most decadent parties.

It is a national treasure, rich with history, after Australia's first prime minister, Sir Edmund Barton, famously dropped dead of a heart attack in one of the hotel's suites in 1920.

110 years later, the Hydro Majestic is set to reopen on Friday, with the rare opportunity to experiencing the glitz and glamour of the jazz age.

The original hotel was seriously damaged in a bushfire in 1921 but has now risen from the ashes after undergoing multi-million dollar refurbishments that capture the essence of the hotel's glory days.

The Hydro Majestic, situated in Medlow Bath in the iconic Blue Mountains, initially began as a health retreat titled the Belgravia Hotel, before it became a buzzing hub of style, glamour and decadence.
