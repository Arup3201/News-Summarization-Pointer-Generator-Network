The Obamas and Bidens spent hundreds of thousands of taxpayer dollars on three separate vacation trips during last year's President's Day weekend, records show. The total tab for he U.S. Secret Service  came to at least $295,437.

President Barack Obama spent that weekend golfing in West Palm Beach, Florida with Tiger Woods' former coach, and appeared briefly with the golf superstar.

The first lady and the Obamas' daughters took their annual three-day weekend jaunt to the Colorado ski resort town of Aspen, where they might have bumped into Vice President and Mrs. Biden â€“ who were there on a separate vacation trip.

The watchdog group Judicial Watch obtained records from the Secret Service through a Freedom of Information Act request, learning that the cost of protecting the president that weekend came to $98,135.79.

That total included $32,406.50 for flights, $16,466.25 for rental cars and $48,490 for hotel rooms.

'The Obamas and Vice President Biden are oblivious to the costs to taxpayers for their vacation travel,' Judicial Watch President Tom Fitton said in a statement to the Washington Examiner.

Michelle Obama's trip cost the government at least $81,523.64 to keep her, Sasha and Malia safe, including $13,221.30 for flights, $3,925 for rental cars and a whopping $64,377.34 in weekend hotel bills.

Not to be outdone, the Bidens' ski weekend cost the most in hard dollars: $115,777.61.

The vice presidential family's security detail spent $92,596 on lodging, $17,866.61 on car rentals and $5,315 on flights.

President Obama's trip also carried another substantial cost: Air Force One is among the world's most expensive aircraft to operate.

The president's private Boeing 747 costs taxpayers $179,750 per hour to fly, according to government estimates published in 2012.

Who, me? -- Michelle Obama's security detail for a three-day ski trip last year set taxpayers back more than $81,000

The Obama administration has come under fire for the expenses it incurs on personal travel and parties.

There have been no estimates yet on the cost of Mrs. Obama's 50th birthday soiree at the White House.

ABC News reporter Jonathan Karl caught White House Press Secretary Jay Carney off guard on Thursday by asking what the final price tag was.

Carney referred him to the East Wing, where Mrs. Obama's office is located, for the answer.
