The face of a killer: Michael Yowell was executed Wednesday after being convicted for the grisly 1998 murder of his parents

A Texas man convicted of brutally murdering his parents on Mother’s Day Weekend during a drug-fueled rampage 15 years ago has been executed.

Michael Yowell, 43, shot his father, strangled his mother and blew up their Lubbock home – killing his 89-year-old grandmother – was executed Wednesday via lethal injection despite objections over the drug used for the execution.

‘Punch the button,’ were Mr Yowell’s last words.

The convicted killed took a few deep breaths, snored and was dead in about 30 seconds. He was surrounded by witnesses, his ex-wife and daughters.

Mr Yowell also took the opportunity to tell his family to tell them he loved them one last time.

‘I love you, to Gerald you're a zero,’ Mr Yowell said, according to KCBD. ‘I love you Mandy and Tiffany. I love you too. Whenever you're ready.’

The 14th execution of the year in Texas, which executes more inmates than any other state, Mr Yowell’s execution was briefly delayed by him joining a lawsuit against the use of a new supply of pentobarbital.

With supplies of German-made pentobarbital – the drug used in lethal injections – running dry, Texas and other states have begun sourcing the drug from compound pharmacies.

Compound pharmacies, which make custom prescriptions, were thrust recently into the national spotlight after states began looking for alternatives to stocks of pentobarbital because overseas manufacturers refuse to supply it for lethal injection.

The murder’s lawyers argued all the way to the Supreme Court the custom barbiturate inflicts unnecessary pain and suffering. The appeal was denied and Mr Yowell was executed.

The former Lubbock resident was the nation’s first inmate executed with the new supply.

The execution comes 15 years after Mr Yowell, high on drugs, went ballistic in his parents’ Lubbock home during Mother’s Day weekend.

Already on probation for burglary and drug convictions, the ex-con had a $200-a-day drug habit, officials said.

The rampage was sparked when father John Yowell, 55, caught his drug addled son trying to steal his wallet.

Michael Yowell shot his father in the 
face before savagely beat mother Carol Yowell, 53, before strangling her
with a lamp cord, according to prosecutors.

The crazed man then opened a gas valve and fled the home, the ensuing explosion claimed the life of grandmother Viola Davis, officials said.

The charred bodies were discovered after firefighters doused the blaze, Mr Yowell was convicted in the deaths of his parents, but not for Ms Davis' death.

‘At some point he's looking his mom in the face, beating her and wrapping a lamp cord around her neck,’ Lubbock County District Attorney Matt Powell, who prosecuted the case, recalled Tuesday. 

‘I think always there are some unanswered questions,’ he added. ‘You want to know how somebody is capable of doing that to their parents.’

Mr Yowell was pronounced dead Wednesday at 7:19pm local time.
