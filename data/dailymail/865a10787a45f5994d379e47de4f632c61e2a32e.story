Manchester United midfielder Anderson is in danger of becoming European football’s most unwanted man after it emerged there has not been a single official enquiry for him during the current transfer window.

The 26-year-old – who cost in the region of £20m when United bought him in 2007 – has not played a game for the club since he was given a 20 minute run out by Louis van Gaal against Burnley in the Barclays Premier League back in August.

The former Brazilian international is officially for sale, just as he has been virtually since David Moyes took over as United manager Sir Alex Ferguson in the early summer of 2013.

Mna United are yet to receive a single official enquiry for Anderson during the current transfer window

However it is understood that – with three weeks of the January transfer window already gone – United have not had a single serious enquiry for a player who the club hoped would be the mainstay of the midfield at Old Trafford when he arrived from Porto seven-and-half years ago.

While many clubs would understandably wish to wait until the summer when Anderson will be a free agent, he is available for a knock-down fee now and would certainly be allowed to go on loan.

However, it seems that clubs around Europe have been put off by stories of Anderson’s lifestyle and weight issues. At United he is privately lampooned, for example, for his liking for fast food.

Anderson's career at Manchester United appears doomed with the midfielder appearing just once this season

Attached to the Gestifute stable of influential agent Jorge Mendes, Anderson should in reality have little problem finding a new club.

However his spell on loan at Fiorentina last spring saw him start just four games and there was little interest from mainstream clubs in him during the summer that followed.

One option for United this month would be pay up Anderson’s contract and effectively allow him to walk away from Old Trafford.
