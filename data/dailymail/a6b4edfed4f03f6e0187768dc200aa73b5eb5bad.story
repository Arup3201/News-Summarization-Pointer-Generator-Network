Accused: Ryen William Wilson has been accused of having sex with two students and pursuing two others at Wayne High School in Fort Wayne, Indiana

A male science teacher has been suspended after allegations that he had a threesome with two of his high school students in his classroom.

Court documents have claimed that Ryen William Wilson also attempted to seduce two other pupils at Wayne High School in Fort Wayne, Indiana, via text message.

Wilson is accused of having sex with two students and pursuing two others. 

The 30-year-old is now facing two counts of child seduction.

It has been claimed that 'Student One' told her friend 'Student Two' that she had been sleeping with Wilson in the academic year of 2013/14.

The pair then claim they had a threesome with him, and 'Student One' later told police she had slept with Wilson a total of five times. 

It is understood the threesome happened only once. 

On March 13, police then spoke with a third student who said she was good friends with 'Student One' and let her her phone to text with Wilson until she got her own mobile phone.

But 'Student Three' then said that Wilson continued to text her separately with comments such as “You know you want this". 

She also told told police that she was then receiving so many texts from Wilson that she eventually had to change her phone number. 

According to court documents, the boyfriend of 'Student Three' later spotted the messages, got jealous and confronted Wilson via text.

Police then spoke with a fourth student who told police she had also received texts from Wilson where he was regularly complimenting her looks. 

She said the flattery started after she sent him a question about homework on social media, and he responded saying she should text him on his private number with any further questions.

Location: Wayne High School in Fort Wayne, Indiana, where the alleged threesome and attempted seductions took place

In Indiana, a teen 16 or older can consent to engaging in sexual behavior unless it’s with a person in a position of power like a teacher, adoptive parent/grandparent or military recruiter.  

Earlier this week, Fort Wayne Community Schools sent out a letter informing parents that two members of staff had been removed from classrooms at Wayne High School due to two separate incidents.

It remains unclear why the second member of staff was suspended.
