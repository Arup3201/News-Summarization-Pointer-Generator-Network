Dallas Cowboys running back Joseph Randle was arrested for shoplifting at an up-scale department store chain outlet on Monday, say Frisco Police.

Police attended the Dillard’s store at Stonebriar Mall in Frisco, north of Dallas, at 8.17pm, after the young NFL star was detained by security staff.

Randle, 22, was charged with Class B misdemeanour theft of goods between the value of $50 (£31) to $500 (£314).

A police spokesman told the Dallas Morning News that Randle tried to take a pack of two black Polo underwear valued at $39.50 (£25) and a small bottle of Gucci Guilty Black cologne priced at $84 (£53).

Randle, whose base salary this season is $495,000 (£311,000), was released from custody on Tuesday morning after posting bail of $350 (£220), police confirmed.

Although behind DeMarco Murray in the Cowboys' pecking order, Randle played a key role in their side's win over defending Super Bowl champions Seattle on Sunday.

Against the league's top rushing defence, Randle rushed for 52 yards in their 30-23 win at CenturyLink Field.

Randle came to the Cowboys as  a fifth-round draft pick from Oklahoma State in 2013 and it is hoped he can take pressure off Cowboys' workhorse superstar Murray.
