Kirani James was described as a 'specimen' by one of his 400 metres rivals on Tuesday and showed just why on a nippy Glasgow night 24 hours later, breaking the Commonwealth Games record with ease.

The 21-year-old from Grenada is one of the athletics world's most impressive performers right now thanks to his fine displays in the one-lap sprint.

James continued that incredible form this week at Hampden Park, where he cruised through the heats and semi-finals before breaking Iwan Thomas' Games record set in 1998.

Crossing the line in 44.24 seconds, his victory in the final saw him complete a full set of world youth, world junior, world, Olympic and Commonwealth titles - all staggeringly achieved in the space of five years.

It is no wonder England's Martyn Rooney called him a 'specimen' on the eve of the final in Glasgow, where 400m world-record holder Michael Johnson was watching on from the stands.

So, having broken the Commonwealth Games record, is he now eyeing the American's long-standing record of 43.18 secs?

'Not really,' James said after the race. 'I am going to be 22 in September.

'Michael Johnson set the record when he was 32 so I have got 10 years to work with. I've got a lot of things to work on. I've got to build up my power.

'You know, I just want to try and get better and just try to come here and represent my country.'

James has dipped under 44 seconds twice this year, including his Central American record run of 43.74 secs.

That run in Lausanne earlier this month was the fastest 400m sprint of the year and he increasingly looks on the cusp of something special.

'My main thing is to come out here and represent my country,' James said.

'I don't really look at all of those other things. As long as I do that and win the title, I am happy with that.'

Fortunately for the athletics fans of Britain, this victory is not the last time James will grace the track in Glasgow as he still has the 4x400m relay to come.

Gone but not forgotten: Iwan Thomas, whose record Kirani James broke, tweeted congratulating him 

Competitors and spectators alike will be hoping for slightly better weather when that comes around, although James does not seem to give a hoot.

'Everybody has to deal with the weather so you just have to do it and try your best,' he said.

'It is not anybody's fault that the weather is the way it is. It is just how it is.

'We just have to run through it, not to think about it. It is really just an excuse for guys who don't really believe in themselves and how they are going to perform.'

That is certainly not something you could level at this precociously-talent Grenadian.
