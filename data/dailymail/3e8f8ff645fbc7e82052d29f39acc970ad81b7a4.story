A controversial colouring book company have re-released their children's anti-terrorism series to include references to ISIS terrorists.

The books, designed by U.S. company Really Big Coloring Books, feature images such as the crucifixion of a Christian by a member of ISIS and the assassination of Osama Bin Laden.

Company founder Wayne Bell said the  books are designed to help explain to children what is happening in the world today.

Really Big Coloring Books has published a new range of anti-terror books aimed at children including references to ISIS, such as this map, which lists America as 'Histories [sic] Greatest Nation'

The new books also include pictures of the five terrorists exchanged for U.S. prisoner Bowe Bergdahl. Wayne Bell, founder of the publisher, says the designs are aimed at explaining world events to youngsters

Also included in the most recent books are a map of terrorist groups and dictators around the world and a picture of the five Taliban detainees released in exchange for Sgt. Bowe Bergdahl.

The company says its books are aimed at children, but does advise adult supervision.

Mr Bell said: 'The reactions differ across the board - some love these books and some simply do not want them at all.

'The original, published in 2011, has sold in over 120 countries and all of these books are profitable.

Other books include drawings promoting branches of the U.S. military including their mottoes

Another controversial book featured this copy of the infamous Rolling Stone cover featuring Boston bomber Dzhokhar Tsarnaev with the headline 'Rock Him and Stone Him'

'I personally wish I never made a book on terror for children - not because I am ashamed of them but because the books are painful for so many, the truth hurts.

'It's such a sad state of affairs in America and across the world that parents would ask for, or ever need, a product on terrorism.'

Alongside their politically-charged titles, the company also produces other books themed around fairies and princesses.

Really Big Coloring Books grabbed attention with the release 'We Shall Never Forget 9/11: The Kids' Book of Freedom' shortly after 9/11.

Another page from a former book includes drawings of Tamerlan Tsarnaev, including a tyre mark over his face representing the fact that he was run over by his brother, Bradley Manning, and Fort Hood killer Nidal Hasan

Really Big Coloring Books, which also makes books featuring fairies and princesses, first attracted attention just after the 9/11 terrorist attacks with The Kid's Book of Freedom (left) and its sequel (right)
