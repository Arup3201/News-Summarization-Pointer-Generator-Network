One former 
drugs cheat, Justin Gatlin, ran the quickest 100 metres time in the 
world this year on Thursday night, while another, Tyson Gay, made his 
comeback with 9.93secs in second place.

Despite
 a night featuring some stellar performances, this was ultimately a sad 
night for track and field at the Diamond League meeting in Lausanne.

Gatlin,
 who served a four-year ban for a second positive test in 2006, powered 
to victory in 9.80secs to regain the No1 spot from Trinidad's Richard 
Thompson, but his USA team-mate Gay certainly did not look like a man 
who has spent a year on the sidelines.

The former world champion equalled the third-fastest time this year in his first race after a one-year drugs ban and then declared he had been 'welcomed back with open arms'.

He was certainly given a warm reception by the near-capacity crowd in Lausanne.

Gay said: 'It feels good (to be back). Yes, it'll be a long road to redemption, but I'm happy with my time.

'It's been tough training - I've been under a lot of stress and stuff like that - but I made it through.

'Everybody's been giving me hand shakes and I've been given a great reception. It's just so good to be back.'

Gatlin
 added: 'I wanted my world lead back. Tyson is a strong finisher but I 
was able to hold him off. That's what shows I'm a world leader right now
 and I'm happy with that.

'I want to quieten the doubters. I wish I could race in the Commonwealths and race in the relay against Usain Bolt.'
