The GammaPix app for Android and iOS, pictured, uses a smartphone camera to scan an area for local gamma radiation levels

Many everyday items give out small amounts of  radiation but if you’re concerned about exactly how much your body is being exposed to, there’s now an app that will tell you.

GammaPix, designed by Connecticut-based developers Image Insight, uses a smartphone camera to scan an area for local gamma radiation.

The app was created with support from the U.S Defense Advanced Research Projects Agency and was successfully tested during recent military exercises.

‘The GammaPix app turns your phone into a detector of ionizing radiation,’ said Image Insight.

‘This isn't one of those fake Geiger counters.'

GammaPix uses scanning technology that analyses videos and photos taken using a smartphone’s camera.

The camera looks for a particular ‘signature’ left behind by gamma rays, similar to how a Geiger counter or other radiation scanner works.

It measures the rate at which these rays hit the camera’s sensor to determine radiation levels and will warn users if they are being exposed to harmful rays.

The technology and software can also be used with images from surveillance cameras and webcams.

Image Insight said: ‘The technology is sensitive enough to detect, within seconds, dangerously high levels of radiation so that you can quickly get away.’

It added the software also collects and saves radiation records, from minutes to hours, to detect weaker radioactivity sources or normal background radioactivity.

GammaPix can additionally be used to detect ‘radioactivity in everyday life’ such as exposure on airplanes, from medical patients or from contaminated products.

The app measures the rate at which gamma rays hit the smartphone camera’s sensor during a scan, to determine radiation levels. A full scan takes around five minutes, pictured left, but will warn a user immediately if a dangerous amount is detected. Scans can also be recorded and stored, pictured right

In military and federal tests it has been used to detect hazards from simulated terrorist attacks, dirty bombs, or hidden radioactive materials.

One recent test took place at the Texas A&M Engineering Extension Service's Disaster City training grounds.

A town was made to look like it had been hit by a twister and the first trainees to arrive on site used GammaPix to scan for radiation.

These scans were then sent to a central command post thought software called GeoSuite, currently used to share information with the authorities following a natural disaster.

Image Insight said users can scan an area and receive a complete radiation reading within five minutes, although dangerous levels will be reported as soon as they are detected.

A similar app called Tawkon Radiation Detector app, pictured, was rejected by Apple because it could be used to calculate how much radiation was being emitted by mobiles and mobile phone masts. Apple said the app could confuse users and potentially frighten them and this was irresponsible

The developers were tasked with creating the app three years ago under a $679,000 contract with the Defense Advanced Research Projects Agency (DARPA).

Insight also got funding and support from the U.S. Department of Defense, the Domestic Nuclear Detection Office (U.S. Department of Homeland Security), and the Transportation Research Board (U.S. National Academy of Sciences).

It has now been made available to the public for Android and iOS phones and tablets and costs £3.21 or £2.99 on the respective app stores.

Apple has previously rejected radiation scanning apps from its store, including the Tawkon Radiation Detector, for being 'irresponsible'.

Tawkon's app was rejected because it could be used to calculate how much radiation was being emitted by mobiles and mobile phone masts, which Apple said could confuse users and potentially frighten them.

Image Insight is working on an additional feature for GammaPix that lets users upload data, log onto forums and compare readings with others in a particular area to help establish which locations are safe or unsafe.
