A leading Chelsea fanzine has attempted to stop civil war breaking out among Blues fans over the return of Frank Lampard to Stamford Bridge on Saturday by urging supporters to give a 'good, appreciative reception' for a player they consider the greatest in the club's recent history.

Chelsea fans are split over how to receive Lampard who will be part of Manchester City's squad this weekend in a clash of the Premier League's top two.

Lampard scored a record 211 goals for Chelsea in 648 games between 2001 and 2014 and is viewed as a genuine club legend by supporters. But many of them are unhappy the 36-year-old is playing for their biggest title rival, particularly as the impression was given he'd go straight to America's MLS as Steven Gerrard will do when he leaves Liverpool.

Now the influential Chelsea fans' magazine cfcuk has entered the debate. Published in memory of Matthew Harding, the club's former vice-chairman who spent millions on the club, they don't want the embarrassment of Lampard being jeered and abused by fans who once worshipped him.

In a strong editorial in this month's edition, cfcuk – who had a good relationship with Lampard when he played for the club - outlined their position. 'Many readers and other observers have asked whether we will begin to turn our backs on him, now he is doing well at Chelsea's main Premier League rivals.

'Like all Chelsea supporters, we would have preferred him to have worked out a deal that would have seen him stay at Stamford Bridge but, failing that, we wish he had gone straight to New York City rather than to another English team, especially the Etihad side.

'That said, the majority of the regular contributors to this fanzine are of the opinion that Lampard is still the greatest player they have seen in a Chelsea shirt and nothing – even match-winning performances for one of Chelsea's rivals – will bring about a change of mind.

'Those who say he is being disloyal to Chelsea by helping Manchester City are simply naïve. Should he play at Stamford Bridge, we hope that he will receive a good, appreciative reception from the home supporters before and after the match but, for the 90 minutes that the game is being played, they give their all in back the team in Royal Blue.'

Lampard was given a good reception by Chelsea's away fans when he played against them at The Etihad and he didn't celebrate scoring City's equaliser in a 1-1 draw.

Another cfcuk contributor Dean Mears called for another show of support to their former hero this weekend, saying: 'Frank will be welcomed back to Stamford Bridge any time. He will get the same rousing reception as he did at the Etihad. 

'That was a moment that made me proud to be a Chelsea supporter – we never forget our heroes, that is what we are all about.

'He might play in sky blue but Frank is Blue and always will be, even if he scores the winner agains us and gives City the title.'

Lampard's former Chelsea team-mates Didier Drogba and John Obi Mikel have also appealed for Chelsea fans to applaud him back, but there is also a section of the Blues support who feel betrayed by their former hero and are refusing to give him a rousing reception.

It was originally believed Lampard would have left for America by the time this fixture arrived but Manchester City admitted they always had the player on a 12-month agreement. Chelsea are currently five points ahead of City at the top of the Premier League table.

It is believed the club did not offer Lampard a new contract to stay at Stamford Bridge when his last deal expired in the summer. His Chelsea highlight was standing in for the suspended John Terry when the club won their first Champions League title against Bayern Munich in 2012.
