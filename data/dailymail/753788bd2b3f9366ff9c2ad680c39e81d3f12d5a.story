The BBC lavished nearly £7million on consultants last year – but has refused to say what they did for the money.

The bill follows a promise made by BBC boss Tony Hall to rein in spending on external management ‘experts’.

A freedom of information request revealed that the consultancy bill for the 12 months to May 2014 was an improvement on the £10.4million the BBC spent the previous year.

The BBC has spent nearly £7million on consultants last year, despite director general Tony Hall, pictured, promising to rein in spending 

However, that bill was considerably higher than the £5million it spent the year before that.

The BBC said some of the money covered the auditing of its annual accounts, but would not disclose how the rest was spent.

‘We are legally obliged to use external organisations to audit our accounts', said a spokesman.

Conservative MP Philip Davies has called for the corporation to be more transparent about how they spend their money 

‘On occasion, just like any other large organisation, we also use external companies for specialist services - this saves the BBC millions of pounds because it is cheaper than employing permanent, full-time staff to carry out work which would only last a short period.

However, MPs said the Corporation has a duty to do explain where its fees have gone.

‘If they want to be feather-bedded by a licence fee, they need to be transparent about how they spend it,’ said Philip Davies, Conservative MP for Shipley in West Yorkshire.

The BBC added that it uses a competitive tender process to choose which firms to hire.

Lord Hall has in the past faced accusations of ‘cronyism’ after he handed a £600,000 management consultancy contract to a friend.

In 2013, he appointed Suzanne Heywood to lead a two-month McKinsey review into making the corporation a ‘simpler place to work’.

Lord Hall worked with Lady Heywood, who is married to Cabinet Secretary Sir Jeremy, at the Royal Opera House before he joined the BBC as director-general.

In 2013 he told MPs that he would not be ‘an easy ride’ for consultants, and pledged to cut back on contracts with firms like Deloitte, Accenture, McKinsey & Co, and KPMG.

‘I want to reduce the amount of money that we pay on consultants, I really do. I am not an easy ride when it comes to consultants,’ he said.
