When you're partnered with the President, being constantly followed by cameras and reporters becomes a part of every day life.

But when he has been in office less than a year, the press attention might still come as something of an unwanted novelty.

French President Francois Hollande's long-term partner Valérie Trierweiler was caught on camera losing her composure with a cameraman while on a walkabout on Saturday.

Drastic action: In the press melee that accompanied the President and his girlfriend, Ms Trierweiler was seen grabbing hold of a cameraman's hood

A clip, shown on Canal Plus programme Petit Journal, shows Mr Hollande and the first lady on a walkabout tour of Tulle in the Corrèze area of the Limousin area of central France.

The footage shows the pair surrounded by camera men and reporters and Mr Hollande is shown on at least one occasion telling the group to calm down.

But as Mr Hollande stops to speak to reporters, an increasingly agitated Ms Trierweiler becomes separated from the President who is by now surrounded by the press pack.

Standing behind one television cameraman and unable to get by, Ms Trierweiler decides that rather than leave the situation to the pair's team of minders she will take matters into her own hands.

The footage shows Ms Trierweiler grab hold of the cameraman's hood and pull him back as hard as she possibly can.

The cameraman soon moves out of the way and 48-year-old Ms Trierweiler is back at her husband's side.

After the footage was aired on french television on Monday night, Patrice Biancone, Ms Trierweiler's chief of staff, took to Twitter to defend her actions.

He claimed that Ms Trierweiler had been 'shaken' by the group of cameramen several times and that she hadn't been treated with 'courtesy'.

Mr Hollande's presidency has been somewhat blighted by the massive unpopularity of his girlfriend Ms Trierweiler, who has been accused in some quarters of abandoning her socialist principles for a life of 'luxury and frivolity'.

Her former boss, glossy weekly Paris Match's owner Arnaud Lagardere, described Ms Trierweiler last year as like 'an unpinned grenade' last year.
