A woman trapped in a burning second floor flat jumped 25ft to her death to escape the blaze which is now being treated as suspicious by police.

A 30-year-old woman apparently hit her head on a telephone box as she leapt out of the window of the building in Hounslow, west London, after a fire broke out above a shop in the early hours.

She was found in the 
street after the fall and pronounced dead. Her 37-year-old husband jumped from the building shortly afterwards with an 18-year-old man. Both were rushed to St Mary's 
Hospital to be treated for multiple 
injuries.

A second person was found dead inside the building during a search by firefighters at around 2am.

Tragedy: Two people have died following a second storey flat fire, pictured after firefighters extinguished the blaze, in Hounslow, London, in the early hours this morning

A flatmate, who didn't want to be named, said: 'I think Fareed and Samshad were in their bedroom when the explosion happened.

'Samshad is the woman who died. As far as I know they both jumped. But Fareed I think is OK. He is in hospital.

'They were lovely people. They were very friendly. You couldn't have nicer people to live with. It is sad. How could this have happened?'

He said a total of eight people lived in the flat. An eye-witness, who didn't want to be named, was in the garden of nearby pub the Rose and Crown when he heard a loud explosion and saw the woman make her desperate leap.

He said: 'We heard two loud bangs so came outside to see what had happened. When we got outside the flat across the road was on fire.

'Then we saw the woman. We didn't know what to do. She panicked I think and jumped. As she fell her head bumped off the top of a telephone box. She fell to the ground.

'I think somebody had already called an ambulance. It was terrifying to must have been desperate to do that.'

A neighbour has described the terrifying moment she woke to a huge explosion which sounded like a bomb going off.

Ongoing investigation: Police are now treating the blaze which killed two people as suspicious
 

Ewa Glowacka, 36, who lives next door
to the flat which burst into flames this morning, fled the building 
with her 14-year-old daughter. 

She said: 'There was a huge explosion, like a bomb going off.

'I heard screaming. It was terrifying everyone was panicking. We just got outside as quickly as we could.

'When got outside I saw the woman on the ground. It looked like she was dead.

'It was a huge fire. Firefighters were there quickly. It was very frightening. We are both lucky to have escaped.'

Another neighbour told how he witnessed a man jump from the window to escape the flames as residents fetched a mattress in an attempt to cushion the landing for others trying to flee the fire.

Deelip Silwal, 26, who lives opposite the explosion, said: 'When I got outside there was a woman on the floor. It was a massive fire coming from the top floor bedroom.

'There was a man at the window. He had no choice I think, he just jumped. About 25 feet I would say.

'He fell on his feet but was on the ground unconscious, he was not moving. He was maybe 35 or something.

'The woman she was unconscious as well, not moving. She looked dead. Her face had no expression.

'There was only one policemen there at the time. He started giving him first aid and mouth to mouth.

'I saw two other people at the window
so one other man went to get a mattress so they could jump on to it. 
The police and firefighters came then and told us to stand back.

'It was very scary because the fire 
was so big we thought it might spread. We were worried for the other 
people in the flat, that is why we got the mattress for them to jump.

Large response: More than 50 firefighters and eight fire engines arrived at the scene in the early hours

'The police told us to get bedding and
blankets for the people, so we did. It was hard to see after that 
because there was so many fire and ambulance people there.'

Eight fire engines and around 58 
firefighters battled to control the blaze which has now been 
extinguished, the London Fire Brigade said.

The fire is believed to have started in a flat above a shop before spreading to the roof and neighbouring flats.

A Scotland Yard spokesman said: 'At 
this early stage it is believed that the fire started in a second floor 
flat before spreading to neighbouring flats. The fire is being treated 
as suspicious.'

He added: 'Three people, two men and one woman, were found outside the premises having jumped from the building.

'Officers from Hounslow are on scene and officers from the Homicide and Serious Crime Command have been informed.

'Officers carried out emergency life support to all three people.

'The woman, no further details, was subsequently pronounced dead at the scene at 2.30am.

'The
two men, aged 37 and 18, were both taken to a central London hospital 
by London Ambulance Service for treatment to their injuries - both 
remain in a serious condition, their injuries are not believed to be 
life threatening.

'The 18-year-old has been transferred to a west London hospital.

Firefighters and police are investigating the cause of the blaze - it is not known whether arson was involved

'London Fire Brigade brought the fire 
under control and is now conducting a search of the building. One 
further body, believed to be a man, has been found inside - no further 
details available at this time.'

Around 50 people were evacuated from the flats and nearby properties and taken to a nearby village hall.

A man who was in the 
building at the time told Sky News: 'I heard a loud bang. When I opened 
the window, I saw some shattered windows on the ground and I thought 
there had been a car crash. That's when I realised there was a body on 
the floor.'

A spokeswoman for the London Ambulance Service said a 30-year-old woman is believed to be one of the two people found dead.

'Staff
treated two patients for multiple injuries, one man believed to be 
18-years-old and one man believed to be in his 30s,' she said.

'Sadly two patients were also found dead at the scene. One is believed to be a 30-year-old woman.'

She
added that four ambulance crews, three duty officers, a hazardous area 
response team and the medical team from the local air ambulance in a car
all attended the scene.

Police confirmed the two patients being treated in hospital are a 37-year-old man and an 18-year-old man.

The fire was first reported by police officers who spotted it while patrolling the area.

Local road closures are in place while firefighters investigate the blaze.
