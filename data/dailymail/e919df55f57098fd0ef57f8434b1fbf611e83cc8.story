Mo Farah became the first British man to win the Great North Run in almost three decades as thousands of runners took to the streets of Tyneside to take part in the famous race.

Hundreds of people lined the roads, cheering on double Olympic gold medallist Farah as he crossed the finish line in South Shields, becoming the first Brit to win the mens' race since 1985, when Steve Kenyon came in first.

Farah, 31, was just two years and three months when Kenyon won the 1985 event, and had hoped to end the home drought last year, only to be beaten by by Kenenisa Bekele, the Ethiopian who holds the world records for 5,000m and 10,000m.

But this year he was able to hold off the challenge of Kenyan long-distance runner Mike Kigen, and scored a personal best time of one hour and one second. 

After the chasing pack fell away, Farah found himself fighting it out with Kigen for the remainder of the race, and finally pulled clear over the final 200 metres of the 13.1-mile course. 

He becomes just the third British men’s winner, following in the footsteps of Mike McLeod, who triumphed in the first two races in 1981 and 1982, and Kenyon.

Going for gold: Farah came into the race having missed the Commonwealth Games before winning double gold at the European Championships in Zurich

'It feels great. I had massive support from the crowd and I just had to dig deep,' he told BBC One.

'Mike's a great athlete and he just kept pushing and pushing so I was thinking 'just hang in, just hang in' so I could create more speed.

'Once we had dropped everybody I was thinking 'it's just me and you' but he wanted to run faster and just put his foot down and kept pushing and pushing.

'There were a couple of times when I was thinking "four more miles, three more miles, two more miles" but I just had to dig in.'

Farah, who came into the race having missed the Commonwealth Games before winning double gold at the European Championships in Zurich, admitted his rapid finishing time came as some surprise.

When asked if he had expected to come home in just 60 minutes he said: 'No chance.

'Early on my aim was to run 60-something but I didn't think I could run that fast. It's great to finish the season with a win and a good time.

'I've learned a lot this year and it has been up and down. But now I want to take a break and relax and get ready for the World Championships next year.'

Kenya would taste success in the women's race as Mary Keitany equalled Paula Radcliffe's course record to edge Britain's Gemma Steel into second place, while British paralympian Shelly Woods won the womens' wheelchair race for the sixth time, completing the course in 50 minutes and 34 seconds.

'I'm absolutely gobsmacked - totally shocked,' she told the BBC.

Ms Cramond, from Darlington, said she started running last year after her mother died.

'I thought I would raise funds for children's charities because children meant so much to her,' she said.

Among their number were a host of celebrities including Radio 1 DJ Greg James, BBC Breakfast presenter Bill Turnbull, Olympic rower James Cracknell, and former Sunderland footballer Michael Gray. 

And the famous Fog On The Tyne was nothing but a distant memory as the sun shone down on the race route, adding to the party atmosphere.
