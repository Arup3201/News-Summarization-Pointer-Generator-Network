Next time Oprah Winfrey steps onto the red carpet take a good look at her heels as there's every chance they were designed by this Perth mum.

Kym Hall started designing her vintage-inspired shoes just nine months ago and she's already landed an opportunity many designers would dream of. 

The 38-year-old was initially just asked to send a pair of strappy heels to talk show queen Oprah Winfrey, but now her designs will feature in the $80,000 celebrity gift bags for next year's star-studded Oscars and Emmys .

'This is really exciting, but it's all a bit surreal. I'm super grateful for the opportunity, I never expected that something like this would happen,' Ms Hall told Daily Mail Australia. 

The mother-of-one answered a publicity call for Australian designers earlier this year who may have products Hollywood A-listers would be interested in. 

But she never expected to hear back.

The 38-year-old was initially just asked to send a pair of strappy heels to talk show queen Oprah Winfrey and landed herself five award ceremony contracts in the process

'I emailed a paragraph about my business and I sent a link to my website, which was very bad at the time,' she said.

'A little while later I got a call from a lady and I told her why my brand was different.

'She went quiet for a very long time... and then she said "I think Oprah will really like your brand. Can you send her a pair through us?".

'Within two hours, I had been sent contracts for five awards ceremonies.'

The 38-year-old said she has a list of celebrities she'd like to see in her designs, including the Duchess of Cambridge

Kym Hall said the Duchess had a refined and elegant style, just like her shoe designs

Ms Hall's designs are the only pair of shoes featured in the 'swag bags', which will go to award nominees at the Four Seasons Hotel from the Academy Awards, Golden Globes, Screen Actors Guild Awards, Grammys and Emmys. 

'It would be incredible if I saw them wearing them. I don't think I'd sleep for a week,' she said.

'A friend of mine who works in public relations visited the set of Bold And The Beautiful last week and they said it was really hard to get into those bags.

The shoe designer said she would be honoured to have an Australian like Princess Mary wearing her shoes

Kym Hall said she wouldn't be able to sleep for a week if she saw a celebrity wearing her shoes

'I didn’t really understand at that point what an honour it was to be accepted.' 

Ms Hall, who started her business Jakii so she could work from home to take care of her five-year-old son, said she has a list of celebrities she'd like to see in her designs. 

'Margot Robbie is up there. She's an Australian and the things she wears our designs may suit,' she said.

'But also the Duchess of Cambridge and Princess Mary. They are very refined and elegant. They're the types of people I'd like to see wearing my shoes.'
