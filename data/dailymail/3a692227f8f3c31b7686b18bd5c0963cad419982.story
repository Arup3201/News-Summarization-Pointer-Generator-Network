The Belgium World Cup squad took a break from the pressures of preparing for the tournament in Brazil by taking part in a half naked photoshoot for a black and white art exhibition.

The likes of Eden Hazard, Kevin de Bruyne and Thibaut Courtois all stripped to the waist to show off their impressive phyisiques for the 'MMXIV â€“ Les Diables/De Duivels' shoot by Stephan Vanfleteren.

The series of photographs even sees Aston Villa forward Christian Benteke, who will miss the World Cup with injury, make light work Kevin De Bruyne as he holds the former Chelsea winger in both arms.

Talent: Eden Hazard points to the sky for the 'Les Diables/De Duivels' expedition by Stephan Vanfleteren

Chelsea winger Hazard also shows his fun side as the 23-year-old points to the sky as he gives a wink to the camera.

The
 portraits will be on show at the Botanique in Saint-Josse-ten-Noode, 
Brussels throughout the World Cup and until August 17, 2014.

The 
Red Devils look to be in high spirits going into the World Cup despite 
having the 5-1 friendly victory against Luxembourg removed from the 
record books as manager Marc Wilmots made too many substitutions.

Romelu
 Lukaku will have been particularly upset with the news after his first 
ever hat-trick for his country was also expunged from official records.

Safe hands: Goalkeeper Thibaut Courtois also stripped to the waste for the pose

Inspired: Photographer Stephan Vanfleteren poses next to a picture of Axel Witsel

Say cheese: Belgium players take some time out from training to get a group photo

Forward thinking: Romelu Lukaku has been in fine form for Belgium ahead of the 2014 World Cup
