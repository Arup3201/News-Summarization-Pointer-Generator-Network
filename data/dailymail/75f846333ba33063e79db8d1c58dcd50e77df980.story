Lionel Messi found himself at the centre of a World Cup storm on Monday as Argentine hero Diego Maradona and FIFA boss Sepp Blatter both registered their shock that he had been voted the outstanding player of the tournament.

Messi seemed a little sheepish, perhaps embarrassed to be told after Argentina had lost Sunday’s final to Germany in extra-time that he would be expected to trudge up the steps at the Maracana Stadium to collect his Golden Ball trophy from the presentation balcony.

Perhaps he was simply worn out, or perhaps he too felt there were more deserving candidates, such as any number of the triumphant German team, Holland’s dashing winger Arjen Robben or Colombia’s six-goal playmaker James Rodriguez, who won the Golden Boot for finishing as top scorer, and who got Maradona’s personal vote.

It was FIFA’s technical study group who chose Messi but a conspiracy theory was soon established that it might be the muscle of sportswear manufacturer adidas who sponsored the Golden Ball award and who might want Messi to win it because he is the global face of their brand.

‘I would give heaven and earth to Leo but when marketing people want him to win something he didn’t (deserve to) win, it is unfair,’ said Maradona, who claimed the same award when Argentina won the World Cup in 1986. ‘I could see that he didn’t want to go up and collect it.’

By his own incredibly high standards Messi did not have the best of seasons in Spain, where his rhythm was hit by injuries but he started the World Cup in Brazil in great touch.

There were wonderful solo goals against Bosnia and Herzegovina and Iran in the group stage. He struck twice against Nigeria, including one of his trademark curling free-kicks, as Argentina won Group F with a maximum nine points but he was unable to transfer this prolific form into the knock-out rounds.

Without his moments of magic, Argentina’s goal-flow seized up. They scored only twice in four knock-out ties, even though three of the games went into extra-time. Messi seemed to fade, looked increasingly tired and was unable to find the net again.

He was on target with his penalty in the shoot-out against the Dutch after their semi-final in Sao Paulo had remained goalless through extra-time but his performance in the final against Germany was subdued and he missed one of the Argentina’s clearest chances.

‘I was a bit surprised when I saw Messi getting the best player of the tournament,’ said FIFA president Blatter. ‘If you compare the beginning of the tournament and why the team of Argentina got to the final then look at the decisive goals he scored.’
