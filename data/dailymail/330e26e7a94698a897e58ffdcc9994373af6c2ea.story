Suspect: Eliver Kestler has been charged with practicing dentistry without a license and distributing controlled substances

New Mexico investigators are looking for more victims of an unlicensed tooth doctor found operating as a ‘mobile dentist’ out of his small sedan around Santa Fe.

Authorities are asking all victims of a man known as ‘El Dentista’ to file a report. Santa Fe police say they want to build a strong case against Eliver Kestler, also known as Eliver Lopez.

The 36-year-old was arrested April 20 on a tip from a former customer. Investigators discovered Kestler with a portable drill machine and other dental equipment in a small, red sedan.

Kestler told police he had a dentistry license in Mexico but no license in the U.S.

One woman told investigators she had teeth removed by Kestler but he didn't come through with replacements.

Kestler has been charged with practicing dentistry without a license and distributing controlled substances.

Clinic on wheels: Police discovered a portable drill machine and other dental equipment inside his red Chevrolet sedan

Man of many names: Kestler, who also goes by the last name Lopez, called himself El Dentista on his Spanish-language business cards

Filthy conditions: Police say all of the equipment was being stored in the car in unsanitary conditions

Disgusting finds: Officers came across teeth molds scattered around the interior of the car

Celina Westervelt, a spokeswoman for the Santa Fe Police Department, described the conditions inside Kestler’s dental practice on wheels as 'disgusting,' explaining that the car was filled with 'leftover residual materials.'

Among the items seized from the red Chevy sedan were teeth molds scattered around the interior and prescription drugs, including Lidocane, Epinephrine, Septocaine and Disprospan.

Westervelt told the station KRQE that an undercover officer called Kestler Saturday pretending to be a new client in need of dental work.

Kestler was initially apprehensive, inquiring how the would-be patient got his phone number, but he eventually agreed to meet the officer on Agua Fria Street, where he was arrested by police.

Police searched Kestler's portable office and discovered and photographed unsanitary equipment and materials.

Health hazard: One of Kestler's alleged patients developed a serious infection after he had removed her four bottom teeth

'Drug pusher:' Officers found prescription drugs, including Lidocane, Epinephrine, Septocaine and Disprospan, which are commonly used in dentistry, inside the red car

Established practice: Investigators believe Kestler has been doing dental work out of his car for at least five years

Excuse: Kestler told officials that he had a dentistry license in Mexico but not in the U.S.

Investigators believe the bogus dentist has been working on patients out of his car for at least five years.

The patient who ended up blowing the whistle on the 36-year-old suspected con artist told police that he paid Kestler $280 to put in four replacement teeth and get two crowns done.

Police say so far five people have come forward to file reports, including a 45-year-old woman who contracted a severe infection after Kestler allegedly pulled out her four bottom teeth without cause.
