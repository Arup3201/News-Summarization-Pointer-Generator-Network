A jealous son reversed his Mazda over his own father because he was convinced he had slept with his ex-girlfriend, a court heard.

Dean Wilson, 37, accused his father of sleeping with his former partner and then warned: 'If I don't kill you now, I'll be back'.

Norman Wilson initially laughed because his son's disturbing promise reminded him of Arnold Schwarzenegger's famous line from the film The Terminator.  

Now the 60-year-old, from Chesterfield, Derbyshire, is so terrified he is planning to move away, the court heard.

Speaking from his home today, Mr Wilson said he is living in fear since his son went to jail.

He said: 'I am traumatised by what happened. I need to move away. Everytime I look out of my front window onto where it happened I have a flashback.'

'I can remember feeling my ribs crack one by one as he reversed over me.

'Then he put one foot on the accelerator and one on the break to spin the wheel round to rip my skin off my legs.

'It was excruciating.' 

He added he has no clue where the idea that he had had an affair with Dean Wilson's ex-partner came from, insisting 'it never happened'.

Norman, a retired recycling worker, said his son had three children with Elizabeth Marshall but that he only saw his grandchildren in passing in the street.

'He's not even with her anymore, I heard he was seeing someone else. Dean was accusing me of having an affair with her five years ago,' he added.

The 60-year-old added he would never be rebuilding his relationship with his son, and felt he was constantly on the lookout for fear he would send someone to hurt him.

'I can't sleep at night or concentrate; I'm always looking over my shoulder. I don't know who his mates are. If my son says he'll be back, he'll be back.

'I've got to get away and move on with my life.'

The defendant, who the court heard has a record of anxiety and depression, was arrested after going to Chesterfield Royal Hospital's mental health unit and admitting running over his father.

He later told police he was certain his father had slept with his ex-girlfriend and that he drove over him twice because he was angry - but he denied trying to kill his father.

Dean Wilson was charged with attempted murder, before the charge was dropped and changed to causing grievous bodily harm with intent, which he admitted in court.

He was jailed for six years at Nottingham Crown Court on Monday.

Prosecuting the case, Dawn Pritchard, said: 'The windscreen of Norman Wilson's Ford Focus had been smashed and he was out vacuuming the car when he heard a screech.

'He turned and saw his son saying he didn't want his kids or his ex-partner at his dad's house or he would kill him.  

'Norman Wilson said the defendant indicated he had smashed the windscreen.

'The defendant said he had been told Norman had been going to bed with his ex and Dean Wilson said he was going to kill him and added, 'If I don't kill you now, I'll be back'.'

Ms Pritchard added: 'The defendant then jumped in his car and came at speed and hit Norman Wilson so he was thrown in the air and as he landed a few yards from his own vehicle the defendant drove at him again and ran over his leg.'

Witnesses said they saw the defendant drive the Mazda at his father before reversing over him.

Natalie Mosley, who witnessed the incident, told the court that she put herself in the path of Dean Wilson's vehicle during another attempt to drive over him.

Ms Pritchard explained how Norman Wilson remembers someone holding his head and saying he was dying when things became blurred.

He was treated for broken ribs, bruising and grazes at Sheffield Northern General Hospital and is now left using a mobility scooter.

In a victim impact statement, Mr Wilson said he feels threatened and that he has to leave the area. 

Matthew Donkin, defending, said: 'Dean Wilson behaved out of character and gave leave to all of his good senses.

'He has been the principle carer for his children aged seven and eight and his 14-year-old stepson.

'There was a lack of premeditation until he got in his vehicle. He immediately admitted what he had done and made full admissions.'

Sentencing, Judge Michael Stokes said: 'Your relationship with your father broke down badly by your suspicions that rightly or wrongly he was involved sexually with your former partner.

'Travelling at a speed estimated at 20mph you drove at him and knocked him into the road and you then quite deliberately reversed over him.

'He was extremely lucky not to have sustained more serious injuries.'

Dean Wilson was also handed a four year driving ban and told his car would be confiscated.
