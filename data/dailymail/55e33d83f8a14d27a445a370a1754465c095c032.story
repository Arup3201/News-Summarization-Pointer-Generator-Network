Mobiles are blamed for making it easy for people to cheat on their partners and conceal affairs - and for serial philanderers a new privacy app is the latest weapon in their cheating arsenal.

HideMyPhone! (HMP) lets people use their current phone as if it had a different number, manage as many numbers as they want and remove all traces of call and message history at the press of a button. 

The app can also be password protected to keep others from seeing what's been said.  

HideMyPhone! (HMP) can be used on multiple devices and there is also no limit to the amount of numbers (selection pictured right) a user can rent. An average 30-day package costs £2.29 in the UK and $2.99 in the US, and numbers can be bought from Brazil to Japan, across Europe and New Zealand among others (left)

It was developed by London-based virtual private network (VPN) provider HideMyAss! 

The firm said: ‘Hide My Phone! is the mobile privacy app that lets you use your phone as if it had a different phone number - keeping your personal number private.

‘Whether you’re giving out your number at a bar, posting it online or need a new number from a foreign country while abroad or for business, Hide My Phone! lets you manage as many numbers as you need quickly and with no fuss.’

Private numbers could also be used to give to companies to avoid being bombarded by sales calls.

All calls and texts are routed through the app but appear on the phone's screen as if they had been sent to the original number. But call history and message information is stored on the app itself. 

Free trial numbers last for seven days, but other numbers typically expire after 30 days.

An average 30-day package costs £2.29 in the UK and $2.99 in the US.

In addition to the monthly rental costs, there are fees to make and receive calls and messages.

Incoming calls and texts are charged at $0.01 per minute and $0.0075 per message.

Outgoing calls and texts are charged depending on the country the user is calling and example rates are available from the HMP! website.

Plus, to send and receive all interactions on the HMP! app the user must be connected to the internet or Wi-FI.

When abroad, this could end up costing a substantial amount of money in data. Although the firm said people can choose to forward calls to a landline and this doesn’t require a web connection. 

The app and account can be used on as many iPhone and Android devices the user wants and there is no limit to the amount of numbers a user can purchase.

Free trial numbers last for seven days, but other numbers typically expire after 30 days.

Numbers can be renewed but if a user doesn’t renew a number they lose it.

When a number expires it enters a ‘quarantine period’ for two months to make sure it’s not being used before being assigned to another user.

All of the numbers are rented in the same way that major phone providers acquire lists of numbers for their customers.

This means that, in theory, a number may have belonged to a person on a contract or pay-as-you-go phone previously. 

But this is the same problem that phone manufacturers also have.

However, all of this privacy comes at a cost - and the small fees soon add up.

An average 30-day package costs £2.29 in the UK and $2.99 in the US, and numbers can be bought from Brazil to Japan, across Europe and New Zealand among other.

Users additionally have to add credit in the same way they would with a pay-as-you-go phone.

In addition to the monthly rental costs, there are fees to make and receive calls and messages.

Incoming calls and texts are charged at $0.01 per minute and $0.0075 per message.

Although the firm said people can choose to forward calls to a landline and this doesn’t require a web connection.

The service does have the potential for abuse and could be used to carry out illegal activity.

But HMA told MailOnline: ‘Hide My Phone! has been created to keep its users private and secure - it doesn’t enable illegal activity any more than the abuse of pay-as-you-go handset might do.

‘If we were required to aid a criminal investigation, we do have the information and ability to attribute a call from and to a HMP! number back to an HMP! user's account and in turn a form of ID attributable to the user's device; which would enable the police to continue their investigation.’

The firm added that illegal activities are strictly forbidden in the app’s terms of service.

Jack Cator, boss and founder of HideMyAss.com said: ‘We have found that VPNs have been used more and more by people who wish to use the internet freely, safely and privately, so we’re really pleased to further extend our services to phones.’

As well as calls and texts, HMP comes with a free anonymous Instant Messenger service that can be used with other HMP users, as well as PIN protection service and a self-destruct button.

This allows users to delete all call and message history with one click.
