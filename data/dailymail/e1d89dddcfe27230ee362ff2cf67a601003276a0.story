House speaker John Boehner has employed an unusual tactic in his latest salvo against Obama - pictures of Taylor Swift.

Boehner (R-Ohio) illustrated an argument attacking the President's plan to fund community college fees for some students by imagining the pop sensation's reaction.

In an article posted to his speaker.gov website, Boehner tried to turn voters against the scheme by showing a 'disappointed' Swift falling out of love with the plan.

Tax implications: Posts were illustrated with moving 'gif' images of Swift, such as the above, and said that the plan would cost taxpayers $60billion

While the excitable singer starts out being thrilled by the idea, the 12-part 'listicle' then shows her furious at the funding implications of the plan - which Boehner's staff say will cost taxpayers $60billion.

The authors, members of Boehner's staff, then observe: 'Not even all the Taylor Swift album sales in the world would cover that bill.'

Continuing with a punning Swift reference, the next picture is captioned: 'Still, 60 billion dollars is a lot of money...you can't just shake it off.'

Unhappy? A seemingly disapproving Swift was the latest weapon turned against the President

Secret weapon: A Boehner spokesman said the article is a 'fun, effective' way to highlight Obama's failings

She is later shown applauding Republican suggestions for helping people by cutting tax - and reforming early education with unspecified reforms. 

It is unclear what Swift would make of being used to make a political point. She refused to say who she would vote for in the last presidential election, despite intense speculation.

A Myspace post from 2008 on her page reportedly said 'Republicans do it better' - but she has since expressed support for issues, such as gay marriage, which align much more closely with the Democrats.

Hooray for tax cuts! A later entry on the post suggested lower taxes as the ideal solution

Boehner's officer told DailyMail.com the listicle is an attempt to widen the audience for the Speaker's political points.

Spokesman Michael Steel told DailyMail.com: 'We are always looking for fun, effective ways to communicate with the American people about President Obama's failed policies, and our better solutions.

'As Speaker Boehner says: "You have to reach people where they are".'

Boehner staffers have used similar tactics before, using shark pictures to highlight a jobs bill and images from How I Met Your Mother to draw attention to a stalled budget.

Representatives of Taylor Swift have yet to respond.

Meanwhile, the Democrats responded to the attack piece via Twitter, with their own picture of Swift labelled 'Haters gonna hate'.
