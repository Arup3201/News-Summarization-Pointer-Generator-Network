A 20-year-old college student is dead and another man is being sought by police after a late night altercation in the New York City subway turned deadly.

LaGuardia Community College student Joshua Basin died Friday night after an oncoming train pinned him between the tracks and the platform at the Bedford Avenue stop in Brooklyn.

Police are now hunting for a man identified in his 30s that witnesses say pushed him onto to tracks.

Manhunt: The NYPD released a sketch of the man who allegedly pushed college student Joshua Basin on the subway tracks; though he managed to escape, Basin was run over by an oncoming train

Late night fight: 20-year-old Joshua Basin died after he was struck by an oncoming L train at Bedford Avenue in Brooklyn

The Howard Beach, Queens resident got into a verbal argument with another man while riding a Manhattan-bound L train, police said.

He and the man, thought to be white and in his early 30s, exited the train at the trendy Bedford Ave stop. The man, wearing a black fleece, reportedly said, ‘It’s showtime.’

That’s when things got physical, witnesses said. 

During the fight, both men fell onto the tracks as hundreds of horrified witnesses looked on.

Though the attacker - who is believed to have been drunk - managed to escape before the train came into the station, Mr Basin was not so lucky, and was hit by an oncoming train.

‘When I looked, he was trying to pull himself out, but there wasn’t enough time,’ one witness told the New York Post.

Another witness told CBS New York: ‘There was a woman kneeling beside (Basin), and she was doing the best she could.

Investigating: Police quickly blocked off the scene and are still looking for the man that was picking a fight with Mr Basin, believed to be a white male

Nightmare: Hundreds of witnesses waiting on the platform watched in horror as the two fell onto the tracks and Basin was crushed

He was taken to Bellvue Hospital with series injuries, and later died.

His mother, Zena Basin, described her son as ‘happy-go-lucky,’ – the opposite of a fighter.

‘If you met him once, you will never forget him,’ she told CBS New York.

''The conductor told us all to back up away from the windows. She kept shouting, "Get back! You don’t want to see this!"'

She told the New York Daily News that she’s seeking justice for her son.

‘Whoever did this to my son needs to turn himself in. I need to find out why he did this to my son.’

Police are still investigating the incident; no arrests have yet been made.

One Brooklyn resident, Sean R. Nyffeler, who was riding on the train wrote of the horrific experience on his blog.

He said he was sitting in the front car – the one that pinned Mr Basin – and felt ‘two or three dull thuds that jostled the entire car.’

Mr Nyffeler wrote: ‘The conductor… told us all to back up away from the windows. She kept shouting, “Get back! You don’t want to see this!”’

Though he didn’t mean to look at the gruesome scene, he said he looked before police ushered him out of the station.

‘He was stuck…between the car and the platform from his waist down, facing the train,’ Mr Nyffeler wrote.

'He was moving his arms so I knew he wasn’t dead yet, but as I stumbled up the stairs and onto Bedfore Ave. I also knew there was no coming back from that.'

Brooklyn bound: The Bedford Avenue stop is in Williamsburg, a trendy Brooklyn neighbourhood that was known for its Orthodox Jewish community

The New York subway has been a backdrop to several gruesome deaths this year.

Only two months ago, an unidentified man’s severed head was found wedged between the train and the platform as the L train pulled up to the 14th Street and Sixth Avenue station.

The same day, 22-year-old Brian O’Mara was struck and killed while wandering in the tunnel between the First and Third avenue stops.

It was unclear why Mr O’Mara, who worked at a web firm, was on the tracks.

The L train runs east from 14th Street and Eighth Avenue in Chelsea, passing through Union Square, East Village, and then entering Brooklyn via Bedford Avenue.

It continues out to Canarsie in Brooklyn.
