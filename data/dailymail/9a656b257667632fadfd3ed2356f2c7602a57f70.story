US President Barack Obama today handed David Cameron an extraordinary pre-election endorsement, hailing the British Prime Minister as a 'great friend'.

With less than four months until voters go to the polls in the tightest UK election for years, Mr Obama used a press conference in the White House to give the strongest possible backing to a fellow world leader.

But behind the smiles there remains sharp differences over Mr Cameron's call for US web firms to do more to open up encrypted messages to security services in the wake of the atrocities in Paris last week.

Mr Cameron has been in Washington for a high profile visit just months before the British general election. The two men dined together in the White House last night, on mushrooms, lamb and warm pear cake.

Images of Mr Cameron with the US President, who is more popular in the UK than in America, will be seen as a huge boost to Tory hopes of contrasting Mr Cameron with Labour's Ed Miliband to be PM.

But the highly unusual personal support from a Democrat President will delight Tory strategists and cause dismay for Labour, who hoped a visit to Washington last year had bolstered his image as a potential statesman. 

Mr Cameron revealed in an interview this month that Mr Obama often calls him 'bro' when they meet.

'Yes, he sometimes calls me 'Bro',' the PM said. 

The US President today said commentators had got into a 'tizzy' about he meant meant by it and sparked a debate about even the definition and origin of the word 'bro'.

Seeking to clear up the confusion, Mr Obama said: 'Put simply, David is a great friend. He is one of my closet and most trusted partners in the world. On many of the most pressing challenges that we face we see the world the same way. 

'Great Britain is our indispensable partner, and David has been personally an outstanding partner - and I thank you for your friendship.' 

In response, Mr Cameron told the President: 'You are a great friend to Britain, and me personally.'

However, as the press conference progressed it became clear that differences remain over the extent to which security agencies should be able to snoop on encrypted messages and social media like WhatsApp, SnapChat and Facebook.

The meeting was dominated by discussions on tackling terrorism and the threat of cyber attacks

Mr Cameron insists the security agencies must be able to intercept communications between extremists and terror suspects who use encrypted messaging services and social media sites to plot atrocities.

But the White House has been cool on the idea, arguing a 'balance' must be struck between privacy and national security. 

The comments came after the two men met in the Oval office for discussions on 'keeping people safe from security threats around the world'.

As police stepped up protection for their own officers and patrols were mounted in Jewish areas, Mr Cameron called for US internet firms like Facebook to do more to catch and report extremists plotting atrocities.

Scotland Yard announced it was taking action after given 'the deliberate targeting of the police' in recent attacks, including in Paris last week.

There will also be increased patrols in Jewish communities in addition to existing security measures.

But speaking ahead of talks with Mr Obama, the Prime Minister warned: 'There's no way you can give 100 percent protection in a free and open society. 

'I would stress that while we have incredibly capable intelligence and security services, while we have very strong counter terrorism police there's an enormous role for the public as well.'

On the general threat level, the Prime Minister added: 'It has been at severe for some time, so people should continue to go about their daily lives. One of the ways we defeat terrorism is to demonstrate that our way of life, our values, are incredibly robust.' 

The British Prime Minister and US President have tried to present a united front in Washington, unveiling joint cyber-security plans and a commitment to securing long-term economic growth

Labour leader Ed Miliband had hoped that a visit to the White House last year, and a meeting with President Obama, would help to prevent a ringing endorsement for Mr Cameron ahead of the election

Earlier they agreed an unprecedented level of co-operation, with a team of agents to help safeguard both countries.

Britain and the US are to set up a joint 'cyber squad' to carry out fake hacking attacks on banks, aircraft and nuclear power plants.

A report from British spy chiefs today warned four in every five big firms in the UK last year experienced some sort of serious cyber security breach.

The PM warned cyber-hackers pose a 'real threat' to the City of London and revealed one attack cost a firm over £800million.

He stressed there was 'need for a panic' because Britain was in a very strong position, and working closely with the US.

Ahead of the meeting in the Oval Office, Mr Cameron said: 'Just as we have worked with our closest ally, the US, to protect our people and our countries from traditional threats, so we must work together to defend ourselves from new threats like cyber-attacks.'

In the wake of North Korea's attack on Sony Pictures, UK and US security services will now establish a joint team of agents to confront the issue and respond to attacks.

Agents at GCHQ and MI5 will work with their US counterparts to encourage information about threats to be shared at a greater pace. They will also conduct a series of 'war games' to test the resilience of both the UK and US in the face of cyber attacks.

The first exercise will simulate an attack on the financial sector, for example on banks in the City and Wall Street, and will take place later this year.

This will be followed by further 'war games' to test critical national infrastructure – likely to include air traffic control, power stations and healthcare systems.
