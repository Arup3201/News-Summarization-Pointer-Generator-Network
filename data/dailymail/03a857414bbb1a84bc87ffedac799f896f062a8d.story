An elderly woman, 77, has died after her husband accidentally reversed his car into a shed she was standing by, outside their home in Mount Annan, NSW.

Police say the 85-year-old man had returned home and was reversing into the driveway, when he appears to have accelerated into a shed and hit his wife.

The woman, who had come outside to greet him, sustained serious head injuries in the accident around 9am on Thursday.
