A former minister who once described the MP expenses scandal as ‘a wonderful moment of  British fiddling’ was facing jail  yesterday after pleading guilty to making bogus claims of £13,000.

Denis MacShane is likely to spend Christmas behind bars after admitting swindling taxpayers out of £12,900 in forged receipts for research and translation services.

He used the money to fund jaunts to Europe, including a trip to judge a literary competition in Paris.

The 65-year-old pleaded guilty at the 
Old Bailey yesterday, ending an extraordinary political saga which has 
raised questions about the protection offered to MPs by parliamentary 
privilege rules.

Notably absent from court was twice-married MacShane’s girlfriend, Vicky Pryce, ex-wife of former Energy Secretary Chris Huhne.

Miss
 Pryce, 60, was released in May after serving two months of an 
eight-month sentence for conspiracy to pervert the course of justice 
after she took the blame for speeding points that should have been 
picked up by Mr Huhne who was also jailed.

MacShane’s shock admission comes four years after Parliament’s sleaze watchdog launched an investigation into his expenses and a year after a police inquiry concluded there was no case to answer, before detectives changed their mind in the light of newly uncovered parliamentary evidence.

The former Europe minister first came under scrutiny in 2009 as Westminster was engulfed by the wider expenses scandal.

MacShane was initially dismissive of the furore, writing in The Guardian in May 2009 that: ‘There will come a moment when moats and manure, bath plugs and tampons will be seen as a wonderful moment of British fiddling, but more on a Dad’s Army scale than the real  corruption of politics.’

But two months later the Commons standards commissioner, John Lyon, launched a formal investigation into his claims for laptops and translation services.

In October 2010 Mr Lyon told Scotland Yard the invoices raised ‘questions of possible criminality’.

However, officers were not given access to damning letters from MacShane in which he admitted using a ‘nom de plume’ to forge invoices from a body he controlled, the European Policy Institute.

The Labour MP said the EPI had been a ‘convenient vehicle’ to fund research trips to the continent and admitted in one letter drawing funds so he could serve on a book-judging panel in Paris. The correspondence was withheld by the Commons authorities on the basis that it had been generated during parliamentary proceedings, and so was covered by the age-old principle of parliamentary privilege, intended to guarantee politicians freedom of speech.

Police dropped the inquiry in July 2012 on advice from prosecutors.

Then last November the Commons standards and privileges committee reopened its inquiry and recommended a 12-month suspension from the House, castigating MacShane for ‘19 false invoices over a period of four financial years which were plainly intended to deceive the parliamentary expenses authorities’.

The report also disclosed, for the first time, the incriminating correspondence between the commissioner and MacShane. He immediately resigned as MP for Rotherham and apologised but insisted he had never gained personally and that he had paid back the cash.

Police re-opened their probe in the 
light of the fresh evidence and MacShane was charged in July, even 
though the letters were still covered by parliamentary privilege and 
would not be admissible in court.

MacShane
 continued to fight the charges, claiming he was given an assurance by 
police that he would not be prosecuted. But yesterday he finally pleaded
 guilty to a single count of false accounting between 2005 and 2008.

Warning him he may go to jail, Mr Justice Sweeney said: ‘You will understand clearly I’m sure that all sentencing options remain open to the court.’

Following the hearing, MacShane did not make any comment as he was released on bail, but he is understood to have accepted that he made a ‘grotesque mistake’.

He is the sixth MP to face prosecution over the expenses scandal.

Elliot Morley, David Chaytor, Jim Devine, and Eric Illsley were jailed in 2011 for fiddling their expenses. All four have now been released. Margaret Moran, who falsely claimed £53,000, was given a two-year supervision and treatment order.

MacShane will be sentenced on December 19.

Former Labour minister Denis MacShane is the latest politician to face punishment as a result of the expenses scandal that erupted in 2009.

In May 2011 Elliot Morley was the first ex-minister to be jailed when he was sentenced to 16 months imprisonment.

The ex-Labour MP for Scunthorpe pocketed £31,333 in claims for a ‘phantom’ mortgage and by grossly inflating the amount he was paying for another.

Other ex-Labour MPs Jim Devine, David Chaytor and Eric Illsley were all jailed for false claims.

Chaytor, the former MP for Bury North, claimed around £20,000 by submitting false invoices for services he never received, and was jailed for 18 months.

Illsley, ex-MP for Barnsley Central, wrongly claimed more than £14,000 and was sentenced to 12 months in jail.

Sentence: Eric Illsley wrongly claimed more than £14,000, while David Chaytor claimed £20,000

Devine, former MP for Livingston, the only one of the four whose case went to trial, claimed £8,385 and was also sentenced to 16 months.

In November last year former Labour MP Margaret Moran was found to have fiddled her parliamentary expenses and received more than £53,000 to which she was not entitled.

She evaded a jail sentence because and has not received a criminal record because she was deemed unfit to stand trial because of depression and so the jury could not find her guilty of any crime.

Her false claims are so far the largest discovered in the expenses scandal.

Tory Lord Hanningfield was jailed for nine months in 2011 after he was found guilty of illegally claiming £13,379 in parliamentary expenses, and the party's first black peer, Lord Taylor of Warwick was sentenced to 12 months in prison after he swindled £11,000 in false claims for travel and overnight subsistence.

Former energy secretary Chris Huhne was jailed in March for perverting the course of justice after he lied about speeding points which his ex-wife Vicky Pryce took for him on her licence a decade ago.

He served 62 days of his eight-month sentence.
