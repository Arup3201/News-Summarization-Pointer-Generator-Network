The future of smoke alarms will not only know you're smoking, it will be able to distinguish exactly what kind of cigarette it is. 

AirGuard accurately recognises smoke from a fire, cigarette smoke and smoke released by marijuana.

It then automatically logs and records the organic compounds found in the smoke, using an app - and this can be used to alert hoteliers, homeowners or even the police.

AirGuard is expected to launch next spring and was developed by the firm FreshAir Sensor.

It has been designed for landlords and hoteliers, but will also be available to homeowners - although, prices have not been announced.

In addition to catching people smoking in businesses or houses, AirGuard's technology has been developed to stop the dangers of so-called third-hand smoke.

Earlier this year, a study found that even after the cigarette has been extinguished, traces of smoke remain in carpets, furniture and dust.

Researchers from York University said the maximum risk predicted from the third-hand smoke levels in a home where people have smoked previously equated to one extra cancer case per 1,000 of the population exposed.

Using a series of polymer films, the AirGuard alarm detects the presence of various organic compounds found in cigarette and cannabis smoke. 

There will be two AirGuard models available; a plug-in device, and a wearable version that fits in the palm of a hand.

The handheld version is battery-powered and connects to an Android app, via Bluetooth, which will launch at the same time as the device goes on sale.

Meanwhile, the plug-in version connects to a network over Wi-Fi and is fitted using tamper-proof screws to make sure it can’t be removed from a hotel room or bedroom.

‘FreshAir Sensor’s primary focus is improving lives through the development of sensor technology,’ explained the Lebanon-based firm.

‘It is the only technology currently available that detects airborne concentrations of these chemicals. The sensors may be used in a variety of devices.'
