It is a time when emotions are already heightened, but these airport farewells just got a lot more tearful.

Dutch airline KLM allowed friends and family members to write special messages to their loved ones and leave them attached to headrests on their plane seats.

Called Cover Greetings, the service was offered at Amsterdam Schipol Airport, where airline workers are seen helping people write messages then rushing to the place to make sure they are in place by the time passengers board.

Passengers are shocked to find personalised greetings from loved ones on board their flight

It's all too much for this lady who sheds a tear after reading her special message

Unknown to them, passengers are set for a special welcome when they sit in their seat

The move by KLM is the latest in a series of customer focus drives that have been warmly received

The special greetings are admired by all who board the KLM aeroplanes

A video created by the airline shows passengers arriving at their seats to find personliased headrests complete with drawings and notes from their loved ones.

While some laughed at the funny messages, others were reduced to tears by heartfelt notes sent by those left behind. 

One girl recognised her artwork as being from her sister adding: 'So I'll miss her. I'm not going to cry anymore.' 

The idea has gone down well with internet users since the video was uploaded to Youtube.

A loving embrace between family members is always the hardest when leaving to board a plane

KLM's move is sure to tug at the heartstrings of passengers who leave family behind

'Whenever you think that does not get better, KLM comes and goes one better. Even if it this is just a one-time action for the filming of a promotional film, the idea is compelling,' adds Jakob Ruprecht.

It's not the first time KLM have developed a customer-led strategy 'out of the ordinary' carried out by their staff.

Back in October a newlywed couple were treated to an express trolley drive, complete with tin cans and a 'Just Married' sign to board their plane.

The 'upgrade' formed part of the #HappyToHelp programme KLM launched on Twitter.
