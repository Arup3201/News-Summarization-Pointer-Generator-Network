Babies might be smarter than we had previously thought and can understand complex social situations from the age of just 13 months old.

A study has found that infants are able to comprehend what constitutes bullying, friendship and what it means to be a bystander.

In an experiment with puppets they responded to different scenarios in a way that suggested they were more engaged than had been expected.

A study has found that 13 month old babies (a stock image is shown) are able to comprehend what constitutes bullying, friendship and what it means to be a bystander

The researchers asked parents of 48 infants aged around one to bring them into the lab for the experiment.

They were sat down in front of a stage where two puppets appeared. 

First, puppet A and puppet B interacted in a friendly manner so the children could get used to them. The scientists then put on a show with a variety of scenarios.  

Children watched a puppet show in which characters named A, B and C, behaved in a friendly way towards each other, as well as bullied and hit each other (a real scenario is shown in a stock image)

A third puppet, C, walked up and was deliberately knocked down by B as A looked on.

In the next scenario when puppet A wasn't present, B knocked down C, and in a third scenario, C was accidentally knocked down as A looked on.

Children who can accurately depict the human form at the age of four are more likely to be brighter in their teenage years, according to a study published last summer.

Psychologists at King’s College London studied pictures drawn by more than 15,000 four-year-olds who were identical ans non-identical twins.

Those who drew with the most skill were likely to do better in intelligence tests a decade later.

The children were asked at the age of four to draw a picture of a child. Each figure was scored between 0 and 12 depending on the presence of features such as a head, nose, ears, hair, body and arms.

The children were given verbal and non-verbal intelligence tests at the time they completed the drawing, and again at the age of 14.

The researchers found a definite correlation between the drawing scores and the two sets of intelligence scores.

Dr Rosalind Arden, of the Institute of Psychiatry at King’s College London, said: ‘Our results show that there is a link between the ability to draw at the age of four and intelligence later in life.

‘Through drawing, we are attempting to show someone else what’s in our mind.

'This capacity to reproduce figures is a uniquely human ability and a sign of cognitive ability, in a similar way to writing, which transformed the human species’ ability to store information and build a civilisation.’ 

The researchers could not talk to the babies to see their response so they monitored how long they looked at the stage to gauge their interest and engagement.

The findings showed that the babies looked longer at things that were unexpected and novel than things which were more predictable.

For example, this happened when puppet A behaved in a friendly manner with B - even after he deliberately knocked down C.

Psychological scientists and study authors You-jung Choi and Yuyan Luo of the University of Missouri said: ‘This to us indicates infants have strong feelings about how people should deal with a character who hits others - his or her acquaintance or "friend" should do something about it’.

Another instance when the babies looked longer at the stage was when puppet A shunned B even if he was not there when he knocked down C.

The scientists said this suggested that the babies were able to keep track of what puppet A knew and use that information to make inferences about it’s behaviour.

The findings indicated the newborns had ‘strong feelings about how people should deal with a character who hits others’, the researchers said.

In their report they explained: ‘Our findings show that 13-month-olds can make sense of social situations using their understanding about others’ minds and social evaluation skills.

‘The research is innovative in that we show that infants are able to construe social situations from different participants’ perspectives.’

Previous research has suggested that babies are incredibly inquisitive and adaptable.

However not all studies said they are smart and the UCLA's Institute For Child Development concluded they were ‘so stupid it’s not even funny’.
