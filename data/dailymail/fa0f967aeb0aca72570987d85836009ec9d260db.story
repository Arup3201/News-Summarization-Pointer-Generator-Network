Police officers have told of their terror during a ‘living hell’ in the riots last summer.

They were threatened with guns and machetes as the violence left them in fear of their lives and feeling like they were ‘in a movie’.

Riot teams were left hopelessly outnumbered as reinforcements were not mobilised by senior officers quickly enough, added officers.

Many fear rioting could erupt again this summer because of continuing social unease.

Show of strength: The disorder eventually came to an end when 16,000 officers were sent out on the streets of London after four nights of chaos

But they warned that efforts to counter trouble would be hampered by budget cuts.

A superintendent in Greater Manchester said: ‘We arrested 300 people but a lot of people on the periphery got away with it.

‘Probably, if I was them, I’d have 
thought “yeah, I’d do it again, and probably get away with it next 
time”.’ The anonymous accounts from more than 130 officers in eight 
forces were collected in interviews by researchers.

'I think if you have bad economic times, hot weather, 
some sort of an event that sets it off...my answer is: yes, it could (happen again).'

'Because I don't think anything has 
changed between now and last August, and the only thing that's different
is people have thought: riots are fun.'

They had been on the front line as the riots spread across London, Birmingham, Liverpool, Manchester and Salford in August 2011.

Many officers said they were astonished no-one was killed as rioters armed themselves with knives, sticks and makeshift weapons.

Nearly all the police interviewed described 
the unrest as the greatest physical and psychological challenge of their
careers.

A 33-year-old senior officer said rioters tried to roll burning cars at colleagues in East London.

He said: ‘You cannot believe this is 
happening in an area of Hackney where people go and have a cup of 
coffee. This is London, it’s not Beirut.

‘The lawlessness was just 
unbelievable. And there seemed to be this anti-police feeling, even from
people whose property we were trying to protect.’

In Tottenham, a 52-year-old senior 
officer said his riot helmet was split in half by a block of masonry 
which knocked him unconscious.

He said: ‘I had a splitting headache.
There was no other option but to remain on duty and do my duty. I was 
at the sharp end for just over four hours, no respite.

‘I had no doubt that if an officer 
had become detached from the main body and taken off on their own, they 
would’ve been killed.’

A 35-year-old sergeant in Liverpool 
said battling rioters was like a scene from the film Zulu. He said: 
‘Three hundred people came round the corner and started attacking us. As
I had my visor down, it was like watching a TV screen.’

The project was carried out by the London School of Economics and The Guardian.

A
29-year-old constable recalled how he was forced to use his iPhone to 
navigate their way to trouble in Tottenham as they travelled across the 
capital to the disorder.

A 25-year-old special constable on his first shift was left all on his own in Hackney, east London, being taunted by looters on Monday August 7 outside a branch of JD Sports.

Fearing for his life at the hands of the mob, he managed to defuse the situation by putting his arm round one of the rioters and posing for a photograph.

As riots spread across cities last summer, police were left drowning in a blizzard of often bogus intelligence.

Rioters discussed tactics on BlackBerry Messenger - but officers were unable to access the messages.

In exasperation they were forced to turn to Twitter in an attempt to stay one step ahead of the trouble-makers.

But the Reading the Riots study revealed that officers ended up wasting their time checking out non-existent incidents.

A bronze commander from Manchester said they would receive a report of 50 masked men 'on Regent Road' - only to find out that they weren't there.

Officers found that senior officers were out of touch with where trouble was brewing - and some of the best information came from people on the ground.

Senior Metropolitan Police officers 
also accepted they struggled to deploy enough staff to contain the 
violence during the four days of disorder in the capital.

They
failed to activate a national alarm system to call for more resources 
until the third day of riots - and once officers from other forces did 
arrive they were hampered by poor communication with central command.

There were just 3,380 officers on duty in the capital when disorder first broke out in London following the shooting of Mark Duggan by police officers on August 7.

By the third night this had risen only to 6,000 - before a massive show of strength brought the chaos to an end when 16,000 officers were sent out on August 10.

The Metropolitan Police had initially relied on local contacts to bring officers into London - and it was only on the third day that they used the National Information Co-ordination Centre to obtain back-up.

Even once outside help was summoned, officers from provincial forces were left dealing with minor incidents as the capital burned.

A 30-year-old Cambridgeshire Police constable told the researchers he could not be deployed in Hackney or Croydon where some of the worst disorder was seen because they could not access the Metropolitan Police radio channel.

Another constable, 37, from the same force told the Guardian: 'It was just frustrating that we blue-lighted all the way down from Cambridgeshire to there, and never really got used for anything apart from sitting in car parks and going to deal with shoplifters in Tesco or Sainsbury's.'

The Metropolitan Police use their own radio channel rather than the standard Airwave system that other police forces use.

Forces
across England also failed to fully act on intelligence gleaned from 
social media networks, which were used by rioters to outmanoeuvre 
police, the interviews revealed.

Officers from West Midlands, Merseyside,
Greater Manchester, Cambridgeshire, Thames Valley, Hampshire, Surrey 
and the Metropolitan Police, were interviewed as part of the study.

Paul McKeever, chairman of the Police Federation, said police would struggle to cope with further disorder if the proposed austerity measures went ahead and urged the government to take 'urgent stock' of the results of the study.

He said: 'This comprehensive analysis demonstrates what we have been telling the Government for two years now; that a 20 per cent budget cut to policing will have a negative impact on public safety and that police numbers really do matter.

'Officers interviewed rightly identify and voice concern that, should the same circumstances occur again, the police service would struggle to cope and contain the situation with the loss of police officers numbers we are experiencing as a direct result of the cuts - over 5,000 last year alone.'
