Rolf Harris was yesterday accused of ‘deliberately lying’ during his trial after being confronted with dramatic new TV evidence.

He is accused of molesting a teenager while filming a celebrity It’s a Knockout-type show in Cambridge during the 1970s – but claims he first visited the university city just four years ago.

However, jurors at Southwark Crown Court were yesterday shown footage of Harris taking part in a show called Star Games filmed in Cambridge in 1978.

After Rolf Harris previously denied having been to Cambridge earlier than four years ago, Southwark Crown Court was today shown a video of him appearing in a TV game show filmed in the city in the 1970s

Prosecutor 
Sasha Wass QC told him the fresh evidence backed up the account of his 
alleged victim, who said she was at the location when Harris groped her 
bottom.

But the veteran TV star replied: ‘I had no idea I was in Cambridge, and I don’t think the other performers or stars did either.

‘I was in Cambridge but I didn’t know I was in Cambridge.’

During
 the opening credits of the Star Games final, a voiceover said the show 
was coming from ‘Cambridge, a tranquil seat of learning.’

Harris
 was announced by host Michael Aspel as captain of one of the celebrity 
teams, which also included actors Colin Baker, Rula Lenska, Julian 
Holloway and Robin Asquith.

The Australian could be seen ‘jumping up and down like a kangaroo and mucking about amusingly’, Miss Wass said.

She told Harris: ‘Michael Aspel seemed to know where he was because he introduced it as being on Jesus Green, Cambridge.’

Harris said: ‘That was the first time I had heard the word Cambridge. I had no idea. I don’t think any of us knew.’

He
 told Miss Wass she ‘didn’t understand the showbiz scene’, saying he was
 often driven from place to place without knowing the location. The 
alleged victim had suggested the event had taken place in the centre of 
Cambridge in about 1975 when she would have been 14.

Footage shown in court today showed Rolf Harris taking part in the celebrity game show Star Games on ITV in 1978. The footage was released to the media today by the prosecution to show that his claim that he first visited Cambridge four years was a lie

Harris said in evidence he had not known where the show was filmed but was accused by barrister Sasha Wass of 'telling a deliberate lie'

After the jury were shown a video of him in a game show in Cambridge in 1978, Harris claimed he had not realised the event had been held in the city

She told the court last month that she had been  working part-time to earn pocket money and was clearing up
 when she saw  Harris entertaining crowds while pretending to be a dog.

'It was quite a funny scene to behold.'

The woman, who is now 52, told the jury of six men and six women that Harris put his arm around her, and moved his hand up and down her back, before squeezing her bottom.

With her voice wavering, she said: 'I can't remember the exact words but he made some motion to me 'come up', and I can see it in my mind's eye as clear as if it was happening now. He came up and put his arm around my left shoulder.

'It was quite a firm hold. I just stood there. I couldn't believe what was going on, this famous person putting his arm around me.

'To start it was a very nervous but a good feeling, however his hand then moved and his hand went up and down my back and his hand went over my bottom and it was very firm.'

The woman said: 'I was too young to really understand the term but it was basically like groping. It was very firm and he squeezed it a few times.

'I was just completely frozen. I knew it was wrong. I couldn't move.'

She said she was 'extremely embarrassed' and moved away as soon as Harris let go of her.

The woman said she contacted the police after the revelations about Jimmy Savile in October 2012 and when it was publicly revealed that Harris had been arrested, because she wanted to back up any other alleged victims.

Miss
 Wass told Harris, who denies the assault: ‘The footage shows you 
monkeying around pretending to be an animal – all of which fits the 
description [the alleged victim] said she saw prior to being assaulted 
by you.

‘You
 have said categorically in this case that all the people who say they 
had been sexually assaulted by you have lied. I’m going to suggest it is
 you who is lying and that video demonstrates it.

'There
 is no way you could have forgotten that event and you deliberately 
tried to mislead the jury when you told them you had not visited 
Cambridge until four years ago. That was a deliberate lie.

‘The film footage ... demonstrated it’s not the victims who have lied, it’s you who lied.’
