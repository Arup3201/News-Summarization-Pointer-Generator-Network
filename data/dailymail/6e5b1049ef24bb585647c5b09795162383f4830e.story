A wealthy businesswoman who developed an 'irrational fear' of her pension running out, defrauded Marks and Spencer by producing bogus receipts on her PC.

Kathleen Stepien, 57, had taken an early retirement with her husband from their family firm, lived in a £250,000 house and had other properties and savings.

But she became so worried about becoming broke, she formulated an idea to make some illegal cash after she took some clothes back to the store and noticed the receipt wasn't marked by the cashier.

Fraud: Kathleen Stepien, 57, raised suspicions at Marks and Spencer at the Trafford Centre, Manchester

Stepien would buy goods then make fake Marks and Spencer receipts on her home computer and return them for a higher refund.

The hearing was told the scam went on for 18 months until police searched her home in Brittania near Bacup, Lancs.

Officers recovered a computer, four blank till rolls, a printer which contained blank Marks and Spencer receipt roll and a memory stick.

Prosecutor Stephen Parker said analysis of Stepien's computer and the memory stick revealed an 'array of bogus Marks and Spencer receipts.'

At Burnley Crown Court, Stepien admitted fraud between January 2009 and January 2011, fraud on October 26, 2010 and possessing articles for use in fraud, on April 7, 2011.

She was fined £2,000, with a £15 victim surcharge and must pay £500 costs.

Mr Parker said on October 26, 2010, a member of staff at Marks and Spencer at the Trafford Centre, Manchester, was working the CCTV camera and her attention was directed at the defendant by security staff.

Stepien went to the checkout and was trying to get a refund for some trousers.

The receipt was from a different store, the cashier had to ascertain its validity and it took some time.

The defendant became 'rather jittery, 'snatched the receipt and left. A photo of her had been obtained from the CCTV footage.

The prosecutor said in April, 2011, Stepien was spotted at the Trafford Centre again, recognised, followed and detained after a checkout transaction. She was arrested.

The £396 receipt she had produced in October was not genuine.

Stepien was searched and six or seven Marks and Spencer receipts, also believed to be fake, were found in her purse. Her house was then searched.

Mr Parker said it had not been possible to ascertain the extent of the defendant's fraud. She had no previous convictions.

In mitigation defence lawyer Keir Monteith, for Stepien, suggested the fraud involved 'a few hundred pounds.'

He said she was 'not a career criminal by any stretch of the imagination,'and had gone back to the same store.

He continued: 'It really wasn't that well thought out, that well planned or that sophisticated.'

Mr Monteith said: 'She clearly didn't need the money. She's clearly very well off, very comfortable indeed and continues to be so at this particular time.'

The barrister added the shame of what Stepien had done would live with her until the day she died.

He added : 'She is utterly ashamed of her behaviour. In fact, she says it's disgusting and that she has let everyone down. Her husband is devastated by it.'

Sentencing the judge Mr Recorder Maurice Greene, who had read references and psychological reports, said Stepien seemingly had no reason at all to commit the offences.

He said: 'It's a very strange set of circumstances which is quite difficult to understand and explain.

'These offences were reasonably sophisticated and it appears the motivation was an irrational anxiety that you would run out of money and you were trying to plug possible gaps by obtaining relatively small amounts of money on a number of occasions.'
