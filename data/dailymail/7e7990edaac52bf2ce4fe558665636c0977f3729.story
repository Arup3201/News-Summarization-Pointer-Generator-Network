Tara Moss has described for the first time how she was raped by the 'cool guy' in her acting class more than 20 years ago. 

The 41-year-old, who is an author and former model, was living in Vancouver when she was assaulted by the man after he offered her a lift home. 

'The one time I was raped was as typical as every stat you hear: someone you know and trust,' Moss told Good Weekend magazine.

Moss, who was just 21 at the time of the attack, said he drove her to his house and invited her in for a cup of tea. He then threw himself on her and would not take no for an answer.

The Canadian-born model described mentally floating out of her body as she was pinned against a wall for hours while he was sleeping, before finally escaping when he went to the bathroom.

'Everything that you are gets removed. You're not there anymore and everything you thought you were and thought the world was gets vacuumed out; you lose your footing,' she said.

Moss, who lives in the Blue Mountains with her Australian poet husband Berndt Sellheim and three-year-old daughter Sapphira, reported the attack to police and the man was eventually charged with about a dozen other sexual assaults.

He was jailed for two years for one rape after his friends testified against him.

The mother of one has broken her 20-year silence in her first non-fiction book, The Fictional Woman, which will be published next week.

Moss also details a number of other sexual assaults and near misses she endured in her early years, including being followed, groped and physically and verbally abused.

She described how she was once walking home in Milan when four Americans pulled up next to her in a car – one man held the door open and another chased her until she reached her apartment.

'That was the closest I've come to being dumped by the side of the road, and maybe not alive,' she said.

Moss started writing crime fiction two years after the attack.

She spent 15 years on a six-book series about a former model studying for a PhD who is attacked by a rapist and murderer.

The series was published in 18 countries and was shortlisted for various literary awards.

Her most recent book weaves her own experiences into a broader look at everyday sexism and issues surrounding women, motherhood and portrayal of women in politics and the media.

By sharing her own trauma in the book, Moss said she wanted to show that she was a survivor and not a victim.

As a women's right advocate and UNICEF ambassador, Moss said she wants to fight the misconception that people often bring problems up themselves saying that view is problematic when it comes to sexual violence.

Moss credits her mother  as the person who has given her the strength to be who she is today - she died from cancer of the bone marrow when Moss was a teenager.
