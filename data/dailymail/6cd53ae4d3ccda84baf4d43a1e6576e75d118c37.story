When Szmul Zygielbojm stood up and denounced 'the greatest crime in history' in 1942 the Polish politician was revealing to the world for the first time the full horror of the unfolding Holocaust.

Three years before the liberation of the death camps, Zygielbojm issued his clarion call but also sowed the seeds of his own destruction warning it would 'be a shame to go on living' if nothing were done.

Just a year later, the Jewish activist took his own life in his London apartment when he realised that Allied leaders and world opinion could not or would not do anything to stop the horror.

Hero: Szmul Zygielbojm, a Polish politician forced to flee his country after standing up to the Nazi regime, was the first person to expose the full horror of the 'final solution' to the wider world

To compound his despair Zygielbojm had learnt that his own wife and child had perished at the hand of the Nazis during the uprising in the Warsaw Ghetto in the early part of 1943.

Until now, however, the extraordinary story of this left-wing activist and politician has remained cloaked in obscurity despite the fact that Zygielbojm's secret network help expose the Final Solution.

Born in eastern Poland, Zygielbojm became heavily active within Jewish trade unions and when Germany invaded Poland in 1939 he took part in organising the Warsaw defence committee.

When the Nazis ordered Jewish leaders to help with the creation of a ghetto in the Polish capital, Zygielbojm publicly opposed the command - and was subsequently smuggled out of the city.

After travelling to Belgium, France and the US, where he spoke at a series of meetings to raise awareness about the plight of Jews, he eventually found himself in London in March 1942.

Realising that he was dealing with a sceptical non-Jewish public, Zygielbojm used British newspapers and the BBC to pass on detailed information he was being supplied with from occupied Europe.

In June 1942, The Daily Telegraph headline read 'Germans murder 700,000 Jews in Poland' and readers were told it was 'the greatest massacre in the world's history.'

Horrifying: By the end of the war, 11million people had died in the Holocaust, of whom six million were Jewish

The source for this story was Zygielbojm, by now a member of the Polish government in exile, who provided information that 'an average of 1,000 Jews were being gassed daily'.

Zygielbojm's network of informants had gathered eye-witness accounts from across Europe, not least the industrial scale of the mass murder with gas chambers being used.

Although Winston Churchill had denounced the Nazi crimes against the Jews as a 'crime without a name' as early as 1941, credible and detailed evidence was supplied by Zygielbojm and his network for the first time.

Speaking to the BBC, he said: 'It will actually be a shame to go on living, to belong to the human race, if steps are not taken to halt the greatest crime in human history.

'In the name of millions of helpless, innocent, doomed people in the ghettos, whose unseen hands are stretched out to the world, I beseech you, you whose conscience is still alive: Expunge the raging shame which is being perpetrated against the human race.'

One of the key pieces in this jigsaw was the Christian Jan Karski, who was the link between the Polish underground resistance and the Polish government in exile in London.

When he was in the Warsaw Ghetto, Karski relied on a guide called Leon Feiner, who also belonged to the Bund, the same Jewish left-wing organisation that Zygielbojm was a member of.

But when Karski relayed the situation to the British and American governments, as well as Zygielbojm, in late 1942 it became clear that the Allies were unable or unwilling to act.

When Zygielbojm asked Karski what message, if any, he had from the Jews trapped in the Warsaw Ghetto, Karski relayed a message from Zygielbojm's comrade Leon Feiner.

Karski later revealed the message from Feiner: 'This is what they want from their leaders in the free countries of the world, this is what they told me to say: "Let them go to all the important English and American offices and agencies. Tell them not to leave until they obtain guarantees that a way has been decided upon to save the Jews. Let them accept no food or drink, let them die a slow death while the world is looking on. Let them die. This may shake the conscience of the world."'

In April 1943, the US and UK governments met in Bermuda, supposedly to come up with answers to the unfolding plight of Jews in occupied Europe.

Ironically this happened just as the Jewish resistance rose up the Warsaw Ghetto despite facing overwhelming numbers of well armed Nazi troops.

An estimated 13,000 Jews died during the uprising and the 50,000 or so survivors were immediately shipped to extermination camps.

Uprising: In 1943, the US and British governments met in Bermuda to discuss the plight of the Jews in Europe. At the same time, the Jewish people living in the Warsaw ghetto began to fight back

Hope: Zygielbojm was hopeful something was finally being done by the Allied forces

Dashed: But he realised that they were not going to act - and the people of the Warsaw ghetto were being taken to their deaths

In May, Zygielbojm realised that the Allies were not going to act and then, to compound his despair, he learnt that his wife Manya and son Tuvla had died in Warsaw.

That month he took an overdose of sodium amytal at his home in west London and left a long and detailed suicide note, explaining his decision to take his own life.

He wrote: 'I cannot continue to live and to be silent while the remnants of Polish Jewry, whose representative I am, are being murdered. 

'My comrades in the Warsaw ghetto fell with arms in their hands in the last heroic battle. I was not permitted to fall like them, together with them, but I belong with them, to their mass grave.

'By my death, I wish to give expression to my most profound protest against the inaction in which the world watches and permits the destruction of the Jewish people.'

Heartbroken: At about this time, Zygielbojm learnt his wife and son had been killed in the ghetto uprising

Suicide note: 'I cannot continue to live and to be silent while the remnants of Polish Jewry, whose representative I am, are being murdered,' he wrote

Parting shot: 'By looking on passively upon this murder of defenceless millions tortured children, women and men they have become partners to the responsibility,' he added

But he also issued a parting shot in the direction of world opinion and the Allied leaders who had singularly failed to act in any shape or form to try and bring a halt to the slaughter.

He wrote: 'The responsibility for the crime of the murder of the whole Jewish nationality in Poland rests first of all on those who are carrying it out, but indirectly it falls also upon the whole of humanity, on the peoples of the Allied nations and on their governments, who up to this day have not taken any real steps to halt this crime.

'By looking on passively upon this murder of defenceless millions tortured children, women and men they have become partners to the responsibility.'

After the war Karski, who died in 2000, expressed his regret that he had 'stupidly repeated the message which Feiner gave me' and that Zygielbojm had then 'lost control'.

When Karski heard of the death, he said: 'I was crushed. I realised at that time at that time that everything is lost for the Jews. He was a soldier to the end. Yes, he was a genuine martyr.'

But the story doesn't end on an entirely sad note because one of Zygielbojm's children did survive.

Joseph became a leading light in the Polish resistance during the war and eventually made his way to the US where he became a scientist in the US space programme before he died in 1995.

Joseph's sons Arthur and Paul both live in the US.
