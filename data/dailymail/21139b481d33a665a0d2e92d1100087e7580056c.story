Happy New Year! Although, if you celebrated New Year's Eve properly then you probably aren't feeling so happy right now. In fact, you should be feeling properly awful. Like you never want to party or drink again? 

If you are contemplating a Dry January then this is actually an excellent thing: remembering this feeling of self-loathing meets severe dehydration will help you through those long, cold, sober Friday nights (there are FIVE of them this month, people).

If booze is a big part of your life then taking a month's time out from your old friend is of course a daunting task.

As many of us attempt the daunting prospect of dry January FEMAIL's Toni Jones gives advice on how to swap wine for water for a whole month

But it's also a brilliant thing to do for many reasons: to save money, to lose weight, to reset your body and brain ready to take on a new year, to prove to yourself that you can actually do it, to break habits, and to have an excuse to organise the RETOX party to end all parties when you finally make it to February.

I gave up drinking for a month last February (partly to do with travelling in January and more to do with it being the shortest month of the year). As a professional drinker I found it tough: lots of my work and social life is booze-if-not-bar based. 

Plus, I generally love drinking and the bonhomie and fun times that accompany a night on the ale. But I did it (surprising side effects included more morning sex and too many ideas to handle) and now have lots of tips on staying sane while staying sober.

So, with thanks too to some of my best drinking buddies, here are 11 ways to help you stay dry when you really would rather not be...

DITCH YOUR FRIENDS

Not forever. But staying on the wagon is a lot easier when you remove yourself from situations that usually include booze. And friends and booze tend to go together like gin and tonic (mmmmm....). 

If you are giving up booze for a month you might want to forget seeing friends who aren't

This is the time to start screening calls, ignoring invitations and make the most of your Netflix membership. Jon Snow, Carrie Mathison and What's App will be your new BJFs (Best January Friends). Don't worry, your real friends will understand, because they will be doing the same to you.

GROOM A PARTNER IN CRIME

The exception to the rule above. Most of us have loads of PICs for naughty nights, now you need some for sober time. If you live with someone try to get that boyfriend/brother/flat mate/wife on the sober train too. 

Like a diet, it's much easier to stay strong when you have support and a joint food or booze-free fridge. Away from the house start doing something that doesn't involve going to the pub, with one of your most fun (and strong on willpower) friends like movies, dog walking or spinning.

NUMBER CRUNCH

On the subject of diets, let's look at this from an entirely shallow point of view and calculate the calories you are saving each time you DON'T drink. 

Not drinking 20 glasses of wine per week (that's four bottles, not unheard of in my house) = a saving of over 28,000 calories and £350 across the month. That's pretty epic. Stay dry, get thin! (Cancer Research has a great calculator on their Dryathlon page).

EMPTY THE HOUSE

Remove temptation by throwing or hiding away all alcohol. A cold beer is a lot less appealing if you need to head to Thresher in the rain to procure it. 

By forgoing wine for an entire month you could save yourself 28,000 calories

Stock up on nice-tasting alternatives like elderflower fizz or fruity smoothies to sate your sugar cravings. And serving soft drinks with ice in elegant glasses will give them a feeling of ceremony, tricking your brain into thinking of them as a treat.

GO TO BED

Hiding away 24/7 isn't feasible, but not drinking and then thinking about not drinking can get very boring indeed, and so sometimes going to bed at 8pm is the only thing to do. 

Friends on the 5:2 diet have similar issues with food on the '2' days and swear by herbal sleeping tablets and a dose of David Nicholls under the duvet.

MAKE PLANS

Keeping busy is the best way to keep your mind off anything and having (booze-free) plans means that you are less likely to say yes to a quick one after work or find yourself wandering into the local off license for a browse. 

Club Soda is a website for people wanting to change their drinking habits and has loads of ideas on stuff to do if you need some inspiration.

SAY NO

If your willpower is weaker than a Stella splash with too much Sprite (mmmmm...) turn down or push back any social/professional events that aren't vital. If 'no' is not an option choose breakfast meetings instead of lunch/dinner. 

If it has to be a dinner fill your wine glass with sparkling water. It might not pass the Debretts test darling but will help feel like you aren't being too worthy (and also make you realise how much wine drinking at dinner is just habit). 

If it's a party then arrive late so that everyone's tipsy enough not to notice you aren't really drinking (there's nothing duller than having to explain to slightly drunk people that you're off the booze) and ignore any (usually grim) Mocktails in favour of a soda and lime.

BECOME THE DESIGNATED DRIVER

Nominating yourself as the group taxi on a night out is a brilliant way to stay dry AND earn mega brownie points from your friends (assuming you can cope with their drunk selves telling you to "turn it up, drive" from the backseat as you head home).

TREAT YOURSELF

Set goals and decide on some suitable rewards for when you reach your target. Getting to ten days, surving a big event, making it through Monday without booze are all causes for a celebration I think.

START A MORNING ACTIVITY 

No booze = no hangovers = longer days. Even a short time off the drink will mean the 'morning after' will become the 'morning before' and no matter how good you think you are at hangovers you WILL have more energy and time at the start of the day. 

How will you use it? If you have children this is a chance to fit in some of the life laundry that never seems to get done (or maybe just an extra hour of crucial social media stalking). 

If you don't, this is the perfect time to take up some kind of exercise (also a great motivator for needing to feel fresh in the morning when the lure of the bar is extra strong). For everyone, it's a window in the diary to plan the rest of the day's healthy living, or at least order some more Nytol from Boots.com.

And if all else fails... GET PREGNANT/GO TO PRISON

Extreme, yes. But a straw poll of my Facebook friends indicates that extreme measures may be needed in the battle to stay dry. Your body will thank you for it.
