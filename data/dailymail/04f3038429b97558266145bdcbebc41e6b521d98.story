This is the moment a businessman Carl Weininger tucked into the world's most expensive dessert which he bought for £22,000 to cheer himself up after he was dumped by his girlfriend.

Mr Weininger, 60, splashed out on the extravagant pudding as a 'pick-me-up' after she ended their three year relationship.

The chocolate-laced pudding, styled like a Faberge egg, is believed to have broken all previous records with its list of ingredients including gold, champagne caviar and a diamond.

Shelling out: Carl Weininger 60, bought the extravagant pudding as a 'pick-me-up' after he split from his girlfriend of three years

Mr Weininger took the pudding to the Aviators' Ball, at Heathrow Terminal Five's Sofitel Hotel on November 26, where lucky guests sampled the luxury dessert.

Each mouthful cost around £800 and the whole dessert took just 15 minutes to devour.

Mr Weininger from Rugby, Warkwickshire, admitted he bought the pudding to cheer himself up after his relationship ended.

He said: 'Buying the dessert was a real boost for my morale.

'I was dumped earlier this year and felt this could be a decent pick-me-up.

That's rich: The pudding, which he shared with other excited diners, pictured, was made at Lindeth Howe Country House Hotel in Windermere, Cumbria

'I'm not much of a chocolate lover myself but all the women who tasted it said "Wow",' said Mr Weininger. The chocolate-laced pudding was styled like

'As someone who buys and sells diamonds, I was also particularly attracted by the diamond that came with it.

'It's not something you do every day and the response has been overwhelmingly positive.

'I'm not much of a chocolate lover myself but all the women who tasted it said "Wow".

'It was absolutely delicious, as you would expect, but only lasted 15 minutes but the flavours will last in the memory forever.'

The pudding was made at Lindeth Howe Country House Hotel in Windermere, Cumbria, which is now awaiting confirmation of its place in the Guinness Book of World Records.

Chef Marc Guilbert layered the flamboyant pudding with a light biscuit joconde and champagne jelly, infused with peach, orange and whiskey.

The 3in by 3in pudding was encased in an outer coating made of bitter dark Belgian chocolate, glazed with edible gold leaf and handmade flowers.

Called the 'Frozen Haute Chocolate' the
chocolate sundae was made from a blend of 28 cocoas from all around the
world, infused with five grams of edible 23-karat gold and served in a 
goblet lined with more edible gold.

But the cherry on the top was a two-carat diamond, supplied by the award-winning Wave Jewellery.

The dessert also contained an £18,000 gold bracelet and a gold spoon set with white diamonds.

The eye-watering £22,000 price tag smashed the previous world record set by New York's Serendipity Restaurant, whose dessert cost £12,000.
