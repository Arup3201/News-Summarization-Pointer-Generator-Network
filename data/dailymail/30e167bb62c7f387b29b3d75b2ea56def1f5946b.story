Missing: While one teenagers in Oklahoma has been charged with the murder of Anne Hill, 16, her body has not been recovered

Nine months after the disappearance and alleged murder of Oklahoma teen, Anne Hill, her parents are pleading for the public's help to find her body.

In October, authorities charged 16-year-old Chadd Raymond with first degree murder and Chloe Marie Thomas, 17, with accessory to commit murder, but no trace of the missing teen has since been found.

Thomas has allegedly told investigators that Raymond dumped Hill's body with her assistance in a 'wooded area in an unknown location', but claims to not remember exactly where in rural Edmond that place was.

Sunday would have been Hill's 17th birthday and PI, Darcie Scoon, coordinator with the Center for Search and Investigation has been charged by her family with finding her body.

She says they have already scoured 2,000 rural acres and covered more than 200 miles without success.

And last month, the state dropped its charges against Thomas pending another case in juvenile court.

Prosecutors allege that Hill, Raymond and Thomas were watching a movie at either Thomas or Raymonds house when Raymond fatally strangled Hill.

Thomas has allegedly told investigators that her and Raymond dumped Hill's body in the back seat of her white Chevrolet and drove her to a location she can't remember and dumped the body.

Recovery: The Edmond teenager was last seen in April after driving to see a film at a friends house

Campaign: The family of Anne Hill want to find the body of their daughter so that they can bury her nine months after she disappeared

Thomas has reportedly told police they covered the body with sticks and leaves and then left her car abandoned in an Edmond neighborhood.

Raymond denies all of this and has entered a plea of not guilty.

Scoon has issued a map which reveals where she believes the body could have been dumped and issued the following advisories of where to keep a look out.

• Oil or pump site areas in a largely open field;

• Is rural with wooded areas in the perimeter;

• Is in close proximity of a highway — a 5-mile or less drive;

• Has a white building (possibly a house) of some type between the highway and well site; and

• Could possibly be near an exit with a natural or manmade rock formation. (information from the Edmond Sun)

Scoon has said that some locations are higher priority than others.

Search area: Thomas has allegedly told investigators that Raymond dumped Hill's body with her assistance in a 'wooded area in an unknown location', but claims to not remember exactly where in rural Edmond that place was.

The honor student at Casady School in Oklahoma City was reported missing nine months agp from her home in Piedmont after she told her mother she was going to watch a film at a friend's house but never returned.

Known to her friends as Annie Jo, she had just received the keys to her first car, a white Chevrolet, and seemed to be upset by an early curfew, so she stopped answering her phone at 11pm the night she vanished.

Her car was found in the Edmond, Oklahoma, more a week later when a resident recognized it from a flier that had been handed out in the area.

A week after she vanished, her mother Lori Hill told KFOR NewsChannel 4: 'Vivacious, outgoing, never met a stranger,' said Lori Hill in April. 'That's not a kid that's planning on running away. That's not a kid that doesn't want to be with her family. That's my Annie Jo.'

While she was missing, her mother also left a voice mail message on her phone which said: 'Anne, I hope that’s you, I love you and miss you.

'I’ll come get you wherever you are, just leave me a message or call your brothers, we all want you home. Anne, I hope it’s you.'

River sites: Scoon has issued a map which reveals where she believes the body could have been dumped and issued the following advisories of where to keep a look out.

Charged with search: Sunday would have been Hill's 17th birthday and PI, Darcie Scoon, coordinator with the Center for Search and Investigation has been charged by her family with finding her body.
