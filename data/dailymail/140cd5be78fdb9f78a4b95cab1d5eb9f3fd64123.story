Despite their khaki uniforms and the lashings of camouflage face-paint, members of the Mexican Army couldn't help but look rather conspicuous as they hitched a ride on the subway yesterday.

The soldiers were travelling across Mexico City to take part celebrations to mark the 204th anniversary of the country's independence movement from Spain yesterday.

Some 22,000 members of the Special Forces streamed to the city's historic center to converge at the giant Zocalo square, accompanied by 157 military vehicles, 13 naval vessels, 44 airplanes and 24 helicopters.

For Mexican President Enrique Pena Nieto, the parade - which included Air Force jets flying low through the capital's skyline and hundreds of soldiers marching in formation - was a chance to display the military's power.

It was also an opportunity for him to honor members of the new law enforcement corps, who since August 22 have operated in crisis zones to try and halt the wave of violence inflicted on the country by powerful drug cartels.

As supreme commander of the armed forces, Peña Nieto passed the troops in review and then ascended to the presidential balcony to watch the parade pass below.
