Adam Scott is relishing the chance to take on Tiger Woods at The Open this week and prove that he is the ‘complete player’ as well as a worthy successor to the golfing superstar as world No 1.

Scott took over at the top of the rankings for the first time in May and admits that there is added pressure on his shoulders to prove himself, especially with the long-awaited return to the game of the 14-time major champion, who has spent a staggering 683 weeks as the top-ranked player in the game during his career.

Woods missed the cut in his only competitive start since undergoing back surgery in March, but Scott insists that Woods is still the man every player has his eye on at Hoylake this week.

Eager: Adam Scott can't wait to prove he is the 'complete player' at The Open this week

Preparing: The Australian poses in front of the 18th hole during a practice round at Hoylake

Atmospheric: He will be hoping to lift his second major following victory at The Masters last year

Speaking in an exclusive video broadcast for MailOnline from this year's Open venue, Scott said: ‘It’s good Tiger is in the field, he’s the guy you want to beat. Heading out there this week everyone will have an eye on Tiger. But there’s so many other guys in form you don’t just focus on him.’

Scott infamously bogeyed the final four holes while leading at Royal Lytham in 2012 to throw away the Claret Jug, so has extra incentive to prove himself against a man who has lifted the game’s oldest prize on three occasions.

‘It would be incredibly special to win The Open as world No 1 this week,’ said the 33-year-old Australian. ‘But there’s such a significance to this tournament, it would give me a feeling of being complete as a player and for my career.

You’d be sitting back and basking in glory with the Claret Jug.’

Back in the field: Three-time Open champion Tiger Woods will be back competing at Hoylake

All smiles: And he looks in high spirits as he aims to win another major

Scott 
admitted that there is added pressure on him this week due to his 
position as the new man on top of the perch and in living up to the 
standard set by Woods.

However
 the former Masters champion concedes that he will not be able to 
emulate Woods’s achievements, which include a mind-blowing 79 PGA Tour 
victories - three short of Sam Snead’s all-time record - as well as his 
major haul, which remains four shy of the mark set by Jack Nicklaus

‘My
 own expectations of playing well every week are quite high. But 
certainly there is that feeling you somewhat have to validate the 
position every week you are No 1,’ he said.

‘Tiger
 did this exceptional job of playing golf as world No 1. Those shoes 
can’t be filled by one guy. There definitely is the added pressure of 
having to perform at a high level every week when you’re world No 1.’

Heartache: And he reacts to missing the shots that cost him his first ever major

Despite
 having to live up to the comparisons, Scott is relaxed and ready for 
The Open, which is the one prize he covets above all others in the game.

And
 Scott is also appreciative of the chance to test himself against 
arguably the greatest player of all time – and certainly the most 
high-profile - once again.

‘I
 think everyone is so happy to see him back on the golf course because 
he’s so huge for the game of golf and we all know that. Whether he hits 
form this week or not is not really the big thing. The fact he’s back 
playing is important for us all and brings so much interest to the 
game.’
