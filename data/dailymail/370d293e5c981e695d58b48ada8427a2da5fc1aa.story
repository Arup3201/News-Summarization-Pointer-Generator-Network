While not everything that glitters is gold, the sparkling new polish from celebrity manicurist Deborah Lippmann most certainly is.

The celebrity nail maestro has created a dazzling new varnish, appropriately named Gold Digger, using flecks of real 24-carat gold.

And with famous fans that include Lady Gaga, Lena Dunham, Kelly Clarkson and Sarah Jessica Parker, the luxury lacquer has already secured the A-list seal of approval as well as an A-list price tag.

The polish, which aims to create a textured manicure, will go on sale for £50 at Selfridges later this month.

As well as gold flecks the varnish is packed with green tea extract and biotin and was used by Deborah herself backstage at the SS15 Badgley Mischka show at New York fashion week last month. 

And this isn't the only Lippmann polish to contain an unexpectedly expensive ingredient: also available are polishes that contain powdered diamonds and crushed pearls.

As a result, the brand has become a regular on the fashion circuit with Valentino, Bulgari and Burberry among those to enlist Lippmann for their shows.

The manicurist has also created bespoke looks for some of the biggest celebrity names in the business.

Most famously, Lippmann did the nails of Reese Witherspoon on the night she took home an Oscar for her part in Johnny Cash biopic Walk The Line in 2005.

Lippmann has also teamed up with some of her celebrity clients to produce bespoke shades that are available for the rest of us to buy.

Among the A-list approved hues are Lara's Theme, a bright orange-coral created with the help of model Lara Stone, and the glamorous deep red Just Walk Away Renee, which was originally made for Renee Zellweger, Sarah Smile for Sarah Jessica Parker, and Bad Romance for Lady Gaga.

And Deborah isn't the only beauty buff with a taste for lucrative polish. Shoe designer Christian Louboutin, whose clients include Victoria Beckham, Blake Lively, Gwyneth Paltrow, and Kim Kardashian, recently launched his debut nail range complete with 31 varnishes inspired by his famous shoes.

The reason the soles of all Louboutin shoes are red is because he 'felt as though something was missing' when he saw his first prototype shoe and decided to paint the bottom with his assistant's red nail varnish. So it was only a matter of time before he unveiled a range of lacquers.

The range of polishes will set you back £36 a bottle... but at least that's a fraction of the price of his £600 shoes.
