According to WTAE, the alleged victim  said that Moffat knew she was only 13-years-old at the time and that 'he would wait for her to get off the school bus and that he allegedly threatened to hurt her if she told anyone, claiming that he slapped and choked her.'

Authorities discovered the young girl while investigating other cases involvoing Moffat, and 'used evidence lifted from Mocospace, a mobile game community, after the suspect uploaded the acts to the site.'

Moffat has also been accused of abuse and stalking by two ex-girlfriends, who both filed protection from abuse orders against him.

He is now facing charges of rape, involuntary deviate sexual intercourse, aggravated indecent assault and sexual exploitation of children. 

He has also had his own daughter since this alleged incident occurred.

'We're not friends with the guy. He seems like a normal Joe. You always hear that on the news. I had no sixth sense about it. Nothing like that,' said neighbor Steve Patton.

As for Micki Golden, who lives in the house right next to Moffat and has twin girls who are 12-years-old, she said; 'I'm appalled. He lives right there. No, I can't have that.'
