The FBI is on the lookout for a recent Army recruit who it believes was planning a ‘Fort Hood-inspired jihad against U.S. soldiers.’

According to an alert sent out by the FBI's Kansas City Division on Friday, they are searching for a man identified as Booker who had told friends of his ‘intention to commit jihad.’

Booker, also known as Muhammad Abdullah Hassan, was recruited by the U.S. Army in Kansas City, Mo., in February 2014 and was scheduled to report for basic training on April 7.

He was discharged last week after law enforcement authorities learned of his alleged plan, reports FoxNews.

Both the FBI and the 902d Military Intelligence Group at Fort Leavenworth are involved in the hunt for him.

The alert is titled, Planned Fort Hood-Inspired Jihad Against US Soldiers By Army Recruit and was issued ‘to inform and protect officers who may encounter this individual or others exhibiting the same aspirations.’

It stated: ‘On 20 March 2014, the Kansas City Division FBI became aware of an individual named BOOKER aka Muhammad Abdullah Hassan who had publicly stated his intention to commit jihad, bidding farewell to his friends and making comments indicating his jihad was imminent.

The Fort Hood shooting took place on Nov. 5, 2009 and is the deadliest mass shooting ever on a U.S. military installation

'BOOKER had been recruited by the US Army in Kansas City, Mo., in February 2014 and was scheduled to report for Basic Training on 7 April 2014.

'Kansas City Division Agents interviewed BOOKER on 20 March 2014.’

It was also sent to the Kansas City Police Department and distributed via the U.S. Marine Corps.

The Fort Hood shooting, referenced in the alert, took place on Nov. 5, 2009 and is the deadliest mass shooting ever on a U.S. military installation.

U.S. Army Maj. Nidal Hasan, a psychiatrist who had become a radical Muslim while serving in the military, killed 13 people and injured dozens more inside the Texas Army base.

Twelve of the dead were soldiers, including a pregnant private who pleaded for the unborn child's life. More than 30 others were wounded in the 2009 attack on the Texas Army post, where investigators collected more than 200 bullet casings.

Hasan, a Virginia-born Muslim, said the attack was a jihad against U.S. wars in Iraq and Afghanistan.

He represented himself at a military trial after clashing with his appointed attorneys, was sentenced to death in August.
