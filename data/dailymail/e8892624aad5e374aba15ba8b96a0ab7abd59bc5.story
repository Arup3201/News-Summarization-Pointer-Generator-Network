Hollywood star Russell Crowe broke down in tears this morning when he was told the news of the death of TV personality Charlotte Dawson.

The 49-year-old Crowe and 47-year-old Dawson were friends from their teenage years - both growing up in New Zealand but moving to Australia to call the country home.

The pair even lived near each other in the luxury apartment complex on Finger Wharf, Woolloomooloo.

Crowe was not far away from Dawson's apartment when police were called to the address on Saturday morning. A police spokesman confirmed a woman‚Äôs body had been found just after 11.15am, and that there were no suspicious circumstances.

Crowe had been with his sons and friends at the Sienna Marina restaurant at the end of the wharf when he was told of Dawson's death by a mutual friend, Woman's Day journalist Jonathan Marshall.

Apart from her work on TV, including Australia's Next Top Model, Dawson was also fashion editor for Woman‚Äôs Day and style editor for New Idea magazines.¬†

Long-time friend: Crowe had known Dawson from when they were both teenagers. Both were from New Zealand but had made Australia their home. They even lived near each other in Woolloomooloo

Crowe was visibly upset as he walked back to his own apartment in the Woolloomooloo wharf complex, and was pictured outside the restaurant with his boys - Charles and Tennyson - immediately after he was told the news.

Despite his grief he clearly wanted to make sure his boys were OK, at one point reassuringly holding Tennyson's head in his hands.

Reports were emerging on Saturday that Charlotte Dawson had long been suffering from depression.

A close friend of the star told Sydney's Daily Telegraph shortly after the news broke that Charlotte had been in 'the worst shape emotionally‚Äô in the days leading up to her death.

One friend is said to have alerted the building manager of her apartment complex after Charlotte failed to turn up to a lunch earlier this week.

That with the fact her Twitter account had remained untouched for at least 19 hours sparked fears that something was amiss.

'She was in very bad shape. Terrible shape,' a friend told the publicaton.

Fragile: Despite being in good spirits when photographed on February 12, Charlotte's friends have said that the star was in 'terrible shape' of late

'She had failed to shop up to a lunch a couple of days ago and then when I had seen she hadn‚Äôt tweeted in almost a day it was clear something was wrong.'

In the past, Charlotte had been open about her long-term battle with depression.

The model mentor was hospitalised in 2012 after she was bombarded with bullying messages by Twitter trolls because of her involvement in an anti-bullying operation.

It was reported at the time she had attempted to take her own life.

Successful: Charlotte has had considerable success on Australian television following her career in modelling

Following her stay in hospital she appeared on A Current Affair and The Project in an attempt to expose the malice behind Twitter bullying.

She also touched on the topic in her book, Kiss And Tell, which was released in October 2012.

However, her appearance on TV prompted even more abuse on Twitter, with some social media users writing comments such as: 'please hang yourself promptly' and 'neck yourself you filthy s***.'

At the time, Charlotte also revealed she had received several death threats during the ordeal.

'I‚Äôve never had death threats of this ferocity. I‚Äôve never had a campaign of this ferocity,' she said.

Model: Charlotte, pictured here in 2005, left her native New Zealand at the age of 16 to model in Europe and with Ford Models in New York

Recently Charlotte hinted in November that she was looking to step away from the spotlight after it was reported she was axed from Australia's Next Top Model due to a cast 'shake-up'.

She told the Herald Sun Confidential at the time: ‚ÄòI‚Äôm tired of the anxiety that comes with working in media, especially as a woman because you‚Äôre scrutinised daily and abused about the way you look.‚Äô

Charlotte's last Instagram post was a picture of herself, and in the caption she told how she was about to appear on the television show Mornings on Channel 9.

'About to go on @mornings9 to talk sex. As you can see I'm racking my brains & have gone blank üò≥,' she wrote.

Regular role: Charlotte was a judge on Australia's Next Top model for six years

Among those paying tribute to Charlotte on Saturday was her former Australia's Next Top Model co-judge and fashion designer, Alex Perry.

'WE LOST A BEAUTIFUL, BRIGHT, SHINING GIRL TODAY... REST IN PEACE MY SWEETHEART...I LOVE YOU. X,' he wrote.

Meanwhile, TV host Sonia Kruger wrote: 'Deeply saddened by the loss of our friend Charlotte Dawson. Our thoughts go out to her loved ones.'
