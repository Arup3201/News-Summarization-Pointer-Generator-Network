A seven-year-old boy has died after being buried alive by his younger brother as they played in a pile of sand at their rural home.

Wyatt McDaniel was pulled unconscious from the mound of sand after his five-year-old brother alerted their father.

Despite desperate efforts by Charlie McDaniel to revive his son with CPR and later by paramedics the boy went into cardiac arrest.

McDaniel was pronounced dead after being airlifted by helicopter from the family's horse farm in Bexar County, Texas.

Tragic: Wyatt McDaniel, 7, died on his parents' horse farm this weekend after he was buried alive in a large sand pile by his brother

Accident: Police are working on the theory that Wyatt was buried by his brother, but they said that no one yet knew for sure how the boy ended up in the pile.

Results of full autopsy has yet to be carried out for what police believe was a tragic  accident on Friday.

Police said it appeared the two boys had been playing in a pile of loose beach sand at the horse farm and riding school.

It is believed they had dug a hole in the top the pile of loose sand and younger brother Logan may have piled the sand back on top trapping his brother.

Paul Berry, spokesman for the Bexar County Sheriff's Office, said the five year old alerted his father.

'The brothers had been playing in the sand together when the younger son came to the father, alerting him that the older brother wasn't moving,' Berry said.

Witnesses told investigators Wyatt and his five-year-old brother Logan were playing in a sand pile while their father Charlie was giving a lesson at the Wild Sunday Farm.

Although police are working on the theory that Wyatt was buried by his brother they said that no one yet knew for sure how the seven-year-old ended up in the pile.

An aerial view of the property, taken by KABB-TV, showed a mound with what appeared to be a depression in the center.

'No one actually saw it' Berry said. 'Clearly there was an accident with sand. And it appeared as if he suffocated, but that needs to be determined by the medical examiner.'

Theresa Chamberlain, who said she knows the family, described the brothers as 'inseparable.'

The boys were 'best buddies,' she said, 'and we're concerned about Logan, and how he will handle this.'

Chamberlain said she is a longtime friend of Logan's mother and has been offering help to the family.

An 'outpouring of support' for the family was being held at Wilderness Oaks Elementary, Wyatt's school.

The community is invited to tie orange ribbons, his favorite color, around the campus.
