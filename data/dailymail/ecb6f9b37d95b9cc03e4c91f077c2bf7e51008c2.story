It has all the usual suspects of Christmas dinner, with turkey, honey roast ham, stuffing, cranberry jelly and even Brussels sprouts. 

But this festive spread is served up in 1.5lb giant toastie. 

Made from two separate sandwiches, the first toastie has up to 4oz of roasted free-range turkey and melted Camembert topped with cranberry sauce.

Flic and Barny Luxmoore who run gourmet toastie service The Jabberwocky in Leamington Spa created the 1.5lbs Mrs Claus - an entire Christmas dinner with all the trimmings in two toasted sandwiches 

The mammoth festive snack has roast turkey, honey ham, herb stuffing, roast carrots, Camembert, cheddar, cranberry sauce and Brussels Sprouts. Three chipolatas and cheesy turkey gravy complete the creation 

The second sandwich contains 2oz of honey roast ham, herb stuffing, roast carrots, cheddar and sautéed Brussel sprouts - but customers can opt remove the sprouts for a £1 charity donation.

The Yuletide sarnie is the brainchild of Flic and Barny Luxmoore, from Leamington Spa. 

The couple, who run The Jabberwocky, a gourmet street food service which specialises in toasties, have called the 1.5lbs festive feast Mrs Claus and have put it on sale for £8.50.

Their festive menu also features a mince pie toastie, made with homemade mincemeat and a scoop of brandy butter, and a turkey toastie with cranberry sauce and Camembert.

The pair - who have been creating Christmas themed toasties since 2012  - have become renowned for their seasonal toasties, even winning the BBC Midlands Street Food Award in 2013 for their very British culinary flare.

Mrs Luxmoore 30, said: 'We've had a great response from customers to the Mrs Claus toasty.

'People use it as an ersatz Christmas dinner, and just love the idea of a whole Christmas dinner - in weight as well as in content - in a single toasty.

'The most common response is a widening of the eyes as we put it together and they realise how much they have let themselves in for.

'But invariably they come back after and tell us it was amazing.'

For those put off by sprouts, the couple are offering customers the chance to remove the Brussels in return for a charity condition of £1, dubbing the option as the 'Mrs Claus clause'.

Surprisingly, they have only had one request to remove the green wintry veg, regularly selling out their entire stock of Mrs Claus toasties with sprouts included.

Mr Luxmoore said: 'We are constantly asked if we can add or subtract ingredients here and there, often making a totally different toasty.

'Before Christmas, we had a horrible premonition that we would spend the entire time taking sprouts out of the Mrs Claus.

'We thought we would at least give people an incentive to try it, seeing as they actually really work.

'Although we have had donations where people have left the sprouts in, only one person has paid to take them out, which perhaps suggest people like sprouts more than we thought.

'We only raised a few pounds for charity, but I guess every little helps.'
