Under the spotlight: Greg Snelgrove gives a running commentary on his work on Twitter but there's concern he's giving too much away

A police force has launched a review of its staff's use of Twitter after a top official was accused of leaking sensitive details on security operations.

Greg Snelgrove, whose police job at Hampshire Police is to plan for emergency situations such as a terror attack, gives a running commentary of his work on the social networking site.

But there is concern the official - who is also a part-time Prince William lookalike - has been publicising secret information that could be helpful to would-be terrorists.

On May 1 Mr Snelgrove, 25, tweeted about 'attending Exercise Emerald Prism today at the South East Counter terrorism Unit (SECTU)'.

The following day he tweeted that he 'is off to RAF Lyneham to observe Exercise Emerald Prism and how we would respond to an extended hostage/siege scenario.'

This exercise, its codenames, locations and descriptions were not in the public domain before Mr Snelgrove's tweets, according to industry expert Alan Turnbull.

Another tweet discovered by Mr Turnbull posted by the head of contingency planning at Hampshire police related to 'Exercise Crossley Star.'

Mr Snelgrove tweeted that is was to take place at the Health Protection Agency's Porton Down laboratories in Wiltshire.

He said: 'At HPA Porton Down for the Exercise Crossley Star structured debrief. We will be discussing the lessons identified and how we can improve.'

On the same campus is the former chemical weapons establishment and now research centre for bio-terrorism countermeasures.

Too much? Mr Snelgrove tweeted this picture of a police operation of an overturned lorry to his followers

Review: This is another picture of an operation he posted online although Hampshire Police say he hasn't given away any secret information although the force said it was reviewing its guidelines on the use of Twitter

A spokesman for Hampshire police 
insisted Mr Snelgrove hadn't given away secret information but confirmed
the force was now reviewing its guidelines on Twitter.

Mr
Turnbull, a media research consultant, said: 'I am not suggesting that 
the codewords are classified in the strictest sense. But they do allow 
people to join the dots and piece together the jigsaw with other 
exercises that might be classified.

'This
could lead to delicate information falling into the wrong hands. With 
regard to the tweet about Exercise Emerald Prism there was no other 
mention of it across the whole internet.

Mr Snelgrove tweets about a trip to RAF Lyneham to look at how police would respond to a hostage situation

Critics say Mr Snelgrove 'got caught up in in the vanity thing on Twitter' and warned about how public Twitter is

Prince William look-a-like Mr Snelgrove said the criticism was 'sensationalist and unfounded'

'I really can't see that the relevant authorities would have wanted these terms bandied about in the public domain and you can't get more public than a Twitter feed. I think Mr Snelgrove is a bit young and naive and has got caught up in the vanity thing on Twitter.

'Transparency in public office is one thing, but this is quite another.'

Mr Snelgrove, who has a Master's degree in crisis and disaster management, tweeted in response to Mr Turnbull's online blog on the matter, that it was 'sensationalist and unfounded.'

A spokesman for Hampshire police said: 'We have reviewed the tweets by Greg Snelgrove. We consider that no secret information has been disclosed but as a pragmatic precaution, we are reviewing our existing guidelines on Tweeting of information regarding exercises.'
