Real Madrid manager Carlo Ancelotti says Cristiano Ronaldo is a 'one-off' in terms of professionalism, and the best player he as ever seen in matches.

Ronaldo has suffered a slump in form since turning 30 and being named World Player of the Year for the second time earlier this year.

But Ancelotti backed the Portuguese forward to get back to his best thanks to his incredible work ethic and unique drive.

'A lot of people would be really surprised by him,' Ancelotti told FIFA.com. 'As I’ve said many times before, he’s a player who’s a one-off in terms of professionalism and responsibility, even at this level. 

'He was born with extraordinary talent, but he squeezes the juice from and works on that talent thanks to a level of drive I’ve seen in few other players.'

The Real boss added that Ronaldo is the player he enjoys watching more than anyone, surpassing his previous favourite Zinedine Zidane.

Ronaldo will need to rediscover his best form if Real Madrid want to close the gap on Barcelona in La Liga

'Zidane was the player I most enjoyed in training, but Ronaldo’s the one I enjoy most in matches – he scores in virtually every game!' said Ancelotti.

By the time Real kick off their Clasico at Barcelona on Sunday, it will be a month to the day since Ronaldo last scored a goal from open play in La Liga.

Ancelotti will hope his prediction of Ronaldo scoring in every game comes true this weekend, if his side are to close the gap on their great rivals at the top of the table.
