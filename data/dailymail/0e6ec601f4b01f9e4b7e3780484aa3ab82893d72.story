Before they hibernate, grizzlies (pictured) eat around 100lbs worth of nuts, salmon and berries

Scientists are studying grizzly bears in the hope they can help solve the worldwide obesity crisis - because they are surprisingly good slimmers.

A study has begun into the fearsome 1,000lbs creatures because they eat up to 58,000 calories a day but don't get fat.

Before they hibernate grizzlies eat around 100lbs worth of nuts, salmon and berries which increases their cholesterol and causes their blood pressure to jump.

Yet unlike humans, they do not suffer heart attacks or clogged arteries - and they don't become diabetics.

U.S. drug maker Amgen is now researching 12 grizzlies held in captivity at Washington State University to work out how they do it.

Dr Kevin Corbit has been looking at their fat deposits, monitoring their hearts, analysing their blood and conducting biopsies in the hope the bears will yield their weight loss secrets.

It is the only facility in the world housing adult grizzlies and offers a unique opportunity to study them.

According to the Wall Street Journal, Dr Corbit was inspired by Yogi Bear and his portly figure when trying to think of a way to research weight loss.

He said that the test results so far suggest that bears modify their sensitivity to the hormone insulin, which controls how sugars and fats are broken down and used for energy.

As they put on weight before hibernation, bears seem to be more sensitive to insulin, he said.

But when hibernation begins they seem to shut off their responsiveness to the hormone completely.

Hope for humans? Experts say that from the test results so far, bears modify their sensitivity to the hormone insulin, which controls how sugars and fats are broken down and are used for energy

Dr Corbit plans to spend the next two years working out how exactly the mechanism works.His work will be assisted by the sequencing of of the bears' genome which he hopes will be completed soon.

The Washington State University bear centre was set up 27 years ago and the animals there were born on site or rescued from places where they went too close to humans such as in a national park.

Dr Corbit, who until now has only worked with rats in a laboratory, had to take extra precautions when dealing with the grizzlies.

The facility where they are held has electric fences buried underground so the bears can't dig them up.

The bears themselves are kept in steel crates when they are being inspected and are put under before samples are taken.

Dr Corbit has also become adept at using honey to distract them whilst another resarcher scans their hearts.

Amgen research executive Dr Alexander Kamb said the grizzly bear research was unusual but given how big an issue obesity had become, it made sense to think differently.

He said: 'I want to learn how the grizzly bears work their magic'.
