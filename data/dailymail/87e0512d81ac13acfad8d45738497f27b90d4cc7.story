This colourful dress made from more than 18,000 rubber bands is sure to add a bit of bounce to any tired wardrobe.

Architect Margarita Mileva has turned her eye for fashion to making outfits from the office stationery.

Mrs Mileva, 49, spends around 90 hours painstakingly knotting and twisting elastic bands together to create each unusual 10 kilogram garment.

Bulgarian-born Mrs Mileva, who lives in New York, said: 'I always had an eye for jewellery and love to design clothes, knit and make collages.

Mrs Mileva says she feels like she is 'paining using rubber bands' when creating her garments or accessories

Her second dress, inspired by the famous German art school Bauhaus, weighed around 23 pounds or 10.5 kilograms

'So when I started making jewellery from reusing paperclips, punched business cards and rubber bands, it didn't come as a surprise to anyone.

'Rubber band dresses were the next step - I am trying to create unique pieces that I would like to be seen as conversation openers.'

Mrs Mileva, who was born in Bulgaria, made it and matching shoes for a competition and exhibition in New Zealand.

The dresses, which have been displayed in art exhibitions, can take up to three months to develop.

This
dress of 18,550 orange and black bands, inspired by the spirit of 
Polynesia and the tattoos of the Maori took around 150 hours to create.

Featuring
black, yellow, purple, green and blue rubber bands in a variety of 
shades and lengths, it felt like a 'breath of fresh air' to make, she 
said.

Mrs Mileva's daughter Iva helped her make her first red, yellow and blue rubber bands.

Her second dress, inspired by the famous German art school Bauhaus, weighed around five pounds or 10.5 kilograms.

'I didn't use any tools but my fingers.

'Slowly,
thousands of rubber bands are knotted, interlocked. twisted together 
and assembled to create the unique texture of the garment.

'The
dresses are unique and I see them as an art form. I am open to the idea
of taking specific orders, like a wedding dress for example,' she said.

'I have never worn my dresses, but the models like them.

'They are very playful and kind of 'dance' with every movement.

'Usually I wear my rubber band accessories, and always love to see people's reaction.'

Mrs Mileva, who works with her architect husband, said: 'The dresses are definitely not light but they are amusing to wear.

'They have to be seen as an art and design form.

'When creating fashion garments or accessories from rubber bands, I have the feeling of drawing and painting using rubber bands.

'They form my material and colour palette.'
