Not content to simply trust his future to his play on the back nine, a young Vermont linksman is making a name for himself with a series or golf-themed hip-hop viral videos.

11-year-old Matty Du Plessis says that he hopes to one day become a PGA pro, though for now he simply plays with his father, Lee, practicing as many as eight hours a day. 

'My best round is whatever I shoot tomorrow, but my lowest round was 64 so far,' he told reporters. 

Not content to simply trust his future to his play on the back nine, a young Vermont linksman is making a name for himself with a series or golf-themed hip-hop viral videos

He admits to occasional mistakes, the same as any linksman, but says he tries to keep a good mental attitude

One video, 'Stop, Drop, and Make a 12 Foota,' he brags about draining 12-foot putts around the globe, even in mid-flight down an airplane aisle

Homeschooled, he once played 108 holes in just one day. 

Now with the handle 'MD_18undapar, he posts videos of him sinking two balls with just one stroke or hitting the ball between his feet to YouTube, Vine, and Instagram.

'I think about what I want to do behind the ball and then hit,' he tells NBC San Diego.

'I try to make stuff that'll entertain people, but it's still golf,' he says.

His goal is to play 18 under par. 

'I don't want to just shoot 18-under-par on one course, one time--shoot it once and then you're done,' he says. 'No. Shoot it many times on all the best courses in the world.'

'You hit a bad shot? Fine,' he says. 'But the more positive you are, the less your misses will become.'

He smiles saying 'Sure hope so,' when asked if he would be the first PGA pro to manage 18-under par in one round.
