The Ministry of Defence is being urged to stop shooting and blowing up pigs for training in battlefield injuries by a group of leading vets.

In an open letter to the government, the experts argue that the use of live pigs in military training exercises is ‘morally wrong, educationally redundant and legally unsound’.

And they question the similarities between pig and human wounds, likening it to testing ‘a drug for parrots on horses’.

Training: The Ministry of Defence has defended its involvement in the 'cruel' practice of blowing up pigs

Animal rights groups have condemned the exercises and insisted modern alternatives could be found.

But last month Defence Minister Philip Dunne insisted the animals were treated ‘humanely’ and nothing was as realistic as using the ‘live pig models’.

Official figures show 115 pigs have been killed to test if they could be saved after being injured in blasts.

In one test a group of farm animals were put in body armour before being blown up at a military base in Porton Down, Wiltshire.

The letter, seen by MailOnline, argues that civil society is ‘willing to accept some forms of animal suffering, where the end justifies the means’ but if the public knew there were viable alternatives to the use of live pigs it would ‘no longer be tolerated’.

Campaigner Andre Menache said pigs and humans were too different for the tests to be useful to surgeons

They cite the decision by the MoD to stop using live goats in submarine tests after pressure from MPs and campaigners.

The letter adds: ‘As veterinary surgeons we are acutely aware of the concept of species differences. We would not test a drug for parrots on horses, so where is the logic in training human doctors on pigs?

‘We live in an age of evidence based medicine. The fact that pigs are “similar” to humans, because both are mammals and both bleed when blown up does not make the pig a predictive model of human outcome.’

They argue humans and pigs are separated by up to 97million years of evolution, and there are major differences in the way they bleed.

Some 95 percent of American and Canadian test sites use lifelike human patient simulators instead of pigs, the letter adds.

‘Pigs are a poor substitute for real life experience. British civilian and military surgeons have for years gained valuable real life experience by travelling outside the UK and providing medical help where it is most needed, in exchange for their training.’

The letter has been organised by Andre Menache, a Belgian vet and director of France-based Antidote Europe.

According to latest figures, some 21 pigs were blown up in 2010, 37 in 2011 and 57 in 2012.

ministers insist the exercise are the only way to replicate the injuries soldiers sustain on the frontline, in order to give military medics training in how to treat horrific wounds.

Official figures show that more than 100 pigs have been blown up in Britain over a three-year period for research into battlefield injuries

Responding to a parliamentary question, Mr Dunne said: ‘As a key element in their training for operational deployment, members of the UK Defence Medical Services attend military Exercise Surgical Training courses in Denmark.

‘These exercises are essential to ensure our medical personnel are capable of carrying out potentially life-saving surgery on casualties with serious bullet and blast wounds.

‘Injuries of such severity are not routinely encountered during their clinical practice in NHS hospitals, but they are regularly required to treat them when on operational deployment. Participating in Danish training minimises the number of animals involved.

‘The pigs are treated humanely with full use of anaesthetics. There are a number of sophisticated simulation models on the market that provide effective training in certain surgical techniques, and the Ministry of Defence already uses these where clinically appropriate.

‘However, none of those currently available provide a viable alternative to the serious bullet and blast wound training that our surgeons receive from live pig models.’

Defence minister Philip Dunne has rejected calls for the tests to end, insisting the pigs are treated humanely

Dear Philip Dunne,

We, the undersigned veterinary surgeons, are contacting you as Defence Minister to ask you to end the use of pigs in military training exercises and to replace them with readily available alternatives.

We respectfully ask that you take into consideration the weight of the following moral, scientific, pedagogical and legal arguments against continuing this practice.

The moral argument

Civil society is willing to accept some forms of animal suffering, where the “end justifies the means” and on the understanding that the higher the cost to the animal in terms of suffering, the greater the expected benefit to human well being.

However, if the public is made aware that viable alternatives exist to the use of live pigs in military training exercises then this practice will no longer be tolerated, as happened in a similar case involving the Ministry of Defence in 2008.

After years of conducting experiments on goats to determine the effects of extreme pressure and the ‘bends’ on submarine crews, the MoD bowed to pressure from MPs and animal protection campaigners and announced that these experiments would stop.

The scientific argument

As veterinary surgeons we are acutely aware of the concept of species differences. We would not test a drug for parrots on horses, so where is the logic in training human doctors on pigs? We live in an age of evidence based medicine.

The fact that pigs are 'similar' to humans, because both are mammals and both bleed when blown up does not make the pig a predictive model of human outcome. Pigs and humans differ in significant ways, for example:

The pedagogical argument The use of live animals to teach and train military as well as civilian surgeons, as illustrated by courses in Advanced Trauma Life Support (ATLS) has long been surpassed by the use of non harmful, alternative techniques.

The legal argument

Articles 4, 13 and 47 of Directive 2010/63/EC on the protection of animals used for scientific purposes endorse the principle of 'Replacement, reduction and refinement'.

Specifically, Article 4 states: 'Member States shall ensure that, wherever possible, a scientifically satisfactory method or testing strategy, not entailing the use of live animals, shall be used instead of a procedure.'

The availability of non harmful alternatives to the use of pigs is now internationally recognised by bodies such as the American College of Surgeons and considered as routine practice in many countries including the US, Canada, as well as the militaries of 23 of the UK’s 27 Nato allies.

The use of live pigs in military training exercises is therefore, in our view, morally wrong, educationally redundant and legally unsound. It is high time the Ministry of Defence ended the practice and instead focused on funding readily available, non-animal alternatives.

the TraumaMan System was evaluated and approved by the American College of Surgeons in 2001 as an alternative to live non-human models or cadavers for ATLS, the leading Trauma Training Course. The system is now used to train over 30,000 medical professionals each year. Since its release, TraumaMan has also become widely used in military courses
