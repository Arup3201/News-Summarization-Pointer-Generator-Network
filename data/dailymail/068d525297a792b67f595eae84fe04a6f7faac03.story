Thumbs up: Kevin Grow gives a thumbs up to fans gathered at an NBA basketball game between the Philadelphia 76ers and the Cleveland Cavaliers

The Philadelphia 76ers have signed a player with Down's Syndrome after inspiring performances in two end-of-season games for his high school.

Kevin Grow was signed with the NBA team to a special two-day contract after he shocked coaches with two varsity game performances at the end of the season.

He was allowed on court and scored a sensational 14 points including three pointers and a buzzer beater during the final two games of the season.

The whole game was caught on film and it went viral within hours.

The basketball manager at Bensalem High School was then spotted by Sixers President and General Manager Sam Hinkie who decided to sign him after coming across the clip.

Speaking of the clip Sixers coach Brett Brown said: 'You just walk away and have a little bit more appreciation for a bunch of things. It’s a grounding effect when you see something like that.'

Mr Brown later told him: 'Everybody is very proud of what you have done and what you have accomplished is sensational. You should be proud of yourself.'

Grow made his big-league debut with the team at home last night against the Cleveland Cavaliers at Wells Fargo Center.

As a ceremonial member of the team he
 got his own custom-made jersey, a stand in the changing room, and went 
out with the team to practice and eat.

He also took part in the team's high-five tunnel as the players ran on to the court. During half-time he was joined on court by his school teammates for a special presentation, in front of proud parents Earl and Dorothy.

His sister Laura said: 'By far, Kevin's favorite team is the Sixers, and he was so excited just to be able to come down here and see practice. But to be a part of the team, and when we got downstairs to see all the media there, it was even more of a surprise.

'This whole thing's just taken a mind of its own, and it's just such a neat experience.'

Player Michael Carter-Williams said: 'That's awesome. There's nothing like that really to see him out there, he's great.'
