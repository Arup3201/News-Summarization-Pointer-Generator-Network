Arsenal WAGS were out celebrating Gunners' FA Cup victory on Saturday night.

Having supported their men during the north London club's 3-2 win over Hull at Wembley, the wives and girlfriend's of Arsenal's victorious players posted a number of pictures posing with the famous trophy.

Bacary Sagna's wife Ludivine took to Twitter to show off Arsenal's prized possession and said: 'The cup and I last night.' Thomas Vermaelen's partner Polly Parsons also shared a snap of the night while goalkeeper Wojciech Szczesny posted a photo to Facebook of himself and other half Marina Luczenko holding the trophy.

On Sunday, following the club's trophy parade, Ludivine posted a picture of her and Sagna with the trophy and tweeted: 'Mr and Mrs with the Cup'.

The WAGS had attended the Wembley showdown as Arsene Wenger's men ended the club's nine-year trophy drought.

Looking forward to the Cup final on Saturday morning, Sagna's wife posted the first of a series of selfies as she sat upon a white leather poof.

This was followed by a picture of a carefully manicured hand holding an FA Cup ticket for the big game.

Ludivine 
was then joined by Mandy Capristo, Mesut Ozil's girlfriend, and their 
journey to Wembley was captured on Instagram with the accompanying 
caption: 'On the way to support our men!'.

Mrs
 Sagna is a regular tweeter of pictures from games, although these could
 be the last set taken as an Arsenal fan with her husband likely to move
 away from the Emirates once his contract expires at the end of the 
season.

The
 France international has been courted by Manchester City and more 
recently United after potential new manager Louis van Gaal identified 
him to provide more competition for the right-back spot at Old Trafford.
