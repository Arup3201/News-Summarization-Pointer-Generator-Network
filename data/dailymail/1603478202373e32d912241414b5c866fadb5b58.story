A South African man rescued his dog before his wife after their yacht hit a reef and nearly capsized in treacherous waters.

Graham and Sheryl Anley were on a three-month tour around the shores of South Africa when they hit rough waters near East London.

The couple ran aground off one of the country's most dangerous stretches of ocean along the Transkei coast on August 4.Â 

Best friends: Graham Anley with his nine-year-old Jack Russell, Rosie

They battled waves of up to seven metres and were eventually swept onto the reef.

But instead of taking his wife to 
safety first, he took his beloved nine-year-old Jack Russell 
terrier, Rosie, which was wearing a specially made dog life jacket 
with emergency strobe lighting.

Geoff McGregor, National Sea Rescue 
Institute North London station commander, said: 'As the incident 
happened Graham sent a Mayday radio distress call and activated the 
EPIRB (Global Positioning Distress beacon) but they were immediately 
forced to abandon ship.

'He first swam Rosie ashore safely before returning for his wife, whose safety line had snagged on the steering gear.'

Once all three were safely on shore, Mr Anley, who is also a sea rescue volunteer, used his mobile phone to raise the alarm.

A rescue helicopter airlifted the couple and their dog to a nearby sea rescue base.

Mr and Mrs Anley are planning to salvage what they can of their 36ft yacht called Boundless.

A spokesman said: 'Sheryl and Rosie will return to the scene and take a few days to assess the situation and salvage what they can of the yacht.'
