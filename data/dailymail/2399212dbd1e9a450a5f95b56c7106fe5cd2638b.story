The old pals' act between Louis van Gaal and Jose Mourinho appears to be contagious as former team-mates Robin van Persie and Cesc Fabregas also shared the love at Old Trafford.

Van Gaal had spoken of the 'special bond' he enjoys with his former Portuguese protege ahead of Manchester United's clash with Chelsea, and the pair embraced warmly before the game.

The love-in then extended to former Arsenal team-mates Van Persie and Fabregas whose eyes met across the crowded tunnel before they hugged it out - while Chelsea defender Branislav Ivanovic looked on somewhat unimpressed.

There is a time and place for public shows of affection - as Mario Balotelli found to his cost after deciding that losing 3-0 at half time was an ideal moment to swap shirts with Real Madrid defender Pepe.

The misfiring Liverpool forward was spoken to by manager Brendan Rodgers, who claims the 'matter is now closed'.

‘We knew what we were getting. I said before this was a calculated risk to bring someone in and nothing has changed. I haven’t been overly surprised by many things,' he added. 

Fabregas will have felt less affection for Van Persie in the tunnel after the match following the Dutchman's added-time equaliser for United.
