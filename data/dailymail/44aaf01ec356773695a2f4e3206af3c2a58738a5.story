Arsenal star Aaron Ramsey has bigger priorities than the World Cup this summer - namely tying the knot with his childhood sweetheart.

The midfielder married pretty blonde Colleen Rowlands at Caldicot Castle in his native Wales last Saturday.

Ramsey arrived by helicopter for his big day and opted for a smart navy suit and tie.

Guests included Theo Walcott, who is missing the World Cup through injury, Real Madrid star Gareth Bale and former Welsh international teammate Craig Bellamy.

After scoring the winner in the FA Cup final last month, Ramsey said of his World Cup viewing plans: 'I’ll be watching bits and bobs of the tournament, but I’ll be on my honeymoon through much of it. Maybe Wales will be there one day.'

The kind-hearted pair asked guests to donate money to the Parkinsons UK charity rather than bringing gifts.

Writing on Colleen's JustGiving page, they said: ‘We are very blessed people and we know we are also hard to buy for – so instead of gifts we would like to offer our guests the opportunity to give to charity.

‘The many hard working people at Parkinson’s UK will put your donations to very good use. Mr and Mrs Ramsey xx’

Later Ramsey tweeted: 'Thank you to everyone who was a part of the last week for making it so special for us #MrAndMrs'

The newlyweds are currently relaxing on honeymoon in Venice but Ramsey still had time to check out the Arsenal fixture list which was released today.

The 23-year-old is wanted by Bayern Munich and Barcelona but he seems content on staying at the Emirates.

He tweeted: 'Seeing the fixtures come out is making me excited for the new season. Can't wait for the first game at home against Palace!'
