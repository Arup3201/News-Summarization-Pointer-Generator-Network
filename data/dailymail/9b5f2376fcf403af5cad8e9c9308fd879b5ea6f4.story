A revolutionary piece of furniture lets you lock yourself away from the world outside (or even just get a moment of peace away from the kids).

The Orwell Sofa is a cabin-like futon that features a roll-down 'blind' letting you cocoon yourself inside.

A pair of young designers from Barcelona created the so-called private urban fort to 'recapture that intimacy which can sometimes be lost, even within our own homes'. 

When the rolled-up curtains come down they shut out light and sound

The hybrid futon, created by Álvaro Goula and Pablo Figuera, can be utilised in a number of ways from daybed to bunker depending on how its features are adapted.

The sofa was referred to as 'a piece of furniture somewhere between a sofa, a bed, and a cabin' as it sat curiously in the design studio, before being christened after the famed writer of 1984.

'Orwell invites you to rest it in its interior and resuscitate that childhood memory of a cabin,' write Goula and Figuera on their website.

'That magical, hidden place that all children wished they had.'

When the rolled-up curtains come down they not only shut out the light, hiding you from view, but also insulate against sound, for the ultimate private moment of peace.

The high back side and large surface area - similar to that of a bed - allows the sofa to be used either sitting or lying down without feeling cramped.

The sleek design lets adults who have long outgrown building forts from sofa cushions to indulge in the activity and create private territory in style.
