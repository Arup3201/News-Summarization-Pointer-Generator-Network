It is a notoriously indulgent sweet treat that could never be classed as healthy.

But Häagen-Dazs are attempting to repair ice cream's rather fattening reputation in Asia with two new low-fat vegetable flavours.

The series, called Spoon Vege, features fusions of tomato and cherry, and carrot and orange, and will be available in Japan from May 12.

The line of unconventional ice creams come in 100ml (3.7oz) mini cups with a spoon, at 284 yen (£1.65) each.

While the typical Häagen-Dazs indulgence consists of 12 to 14 per cent milk fat by composition, the Tomato-Cherry flavour, for example, is 20 
per cent fruit juice and just 8.5 per cent milk fat.

The low-fat treat is made from a 
combination of cherry juice and tomato paste. It is said to combine the 'natural sweetness of tomato with the fruity flavor of cherry', which works to accentuate the rich taste of the tomato.

Meanwhile, Carrot-Orange features a blend of concentrated carrot juice, orange juice concentrate, orange pulp, and orange peel. It has the same 8.5 per cent milk fat but less concentrated juice at just 5 per cent, say RocketNews24.

This flavour takes the gentle taste of carrot and adds to it the citrus zing and scent of 
orange, giving the carrot a 'sophisticated and refreshing twist'.
