It's every bride's worst nightmare... that an unsightly blemish might ruin their wedding photos.

And poor Solange Knowles appears to have suffered a nasty case of hives after walking down the aisle with her video director boyfriend Alan Ferguson on Sunday in a fun-filled New Orleans ceremony.

The singer was pictured with unfortunate red lumps all over of her face and neck, something which TMZ has attributed to a food allergy, as she clambered into the back of a waiting car with her sister, Beyonce, and brother-in-law, Jay Z.

Angry rash: Solange Knowles was pictures with raised, itchy-looking blemishes all over her face and neck as she left her New Orleans wedding venue on Sunday after tying the knot with Alan Ferguson

Her superstar sibling was at hand to help and appeared to be comforting her, covering her up in the back of the vehicle.

A source told TMZ: 'Solange suffered some kind of food allergy, though she isn't sure what it was from....the hives were gone in a matter of minutes.'

MailOnline has contacted the star's representative for comment.

Luckily for Solange, it seems her angry allergic breakout only occurred at the end of the ceremony and didn't ruin the whole day.

She was the epitome of elegance as she walked down the aisle with her long-term love Alan, clad in a conservative yet chic cape dress.

After the wedding bells rang, Solange opted to let loose, slipping out of her floor-length gown and into a plunging jumpsuit - her second of the day - to commemorate her nuptials.

But the 28-year-old singer seemed to be so high on love she didn't realize she suffered from a minor wardrobe malfunction while dancing the night away at a Mardi Gras style parade in New Orleans' French Quarter. 

Unfortunately, Solange had a slight nip slip, revealing a bit too much through the large cut-out in the front of her bright white caped onesie.

After recognising the dilemma, she was seen holding a hand over her chest.

Yet, nothing could keep the blushing bride from enjoying her big day, unable to stop smiling amid of any dramas.

Prior to her party, Solange was spotted in a Humberto Leon for Kenzo floor-length gown with an attached cape, which is what she wore to say 'I do' to her longtime love, reports Us Weekly.

And the star wore yet another wedding ensemble, a plunging cream jumpsuit, as she and her love arrived at the venue together, riding bicycles.

Her hair was styled in its signature Afro and she added a pop of collar to her cream ensemble with crimson lips which remained throughout the day.

The wedding festivities kicked off on Friday with Solange and Alan treating Beyonce and about 50 of their friends to cinema night at the Indywood movie theatre. 

They watched the Diana Ross 1975 classic film Mahogany, the movie they saw on their first date, as People reported. 

Before the film played, the couple screened a very personal documentary that they made of how they met.

'It was pretty adorable,' Indywood Movie Theatre owner Hayley Sampson told People. 

'They were talking about how they met and that they bonded (over) this film and then showed everybody the movie.' 

Everyone was in great spirits, a sign that the infamous elevator fight back in May - in which Solange was caught hitting Jay Z in front of Beyoncé - is all in the past.

'What's important is that my family and I are all good,' Solange told Lucky magazine. 'What we had to say collectively was in the statement that we put out, and we all feel at peace with that.' 

'At the end of the day families have problems and we're no different,' Solange, Beyoncé and Jay Z said in a joint statement after the physical altercation.

'We love each other and above all we are family. We've put this behind us and hope everyone else will do the same.'
