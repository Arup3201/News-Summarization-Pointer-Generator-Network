Pfizer last night signalled that its £63billion takeover of British rival AstraZeneca may cost thousands of jobs.

The US drugs firm told MPs its planned takeover would ‘reduce overlaps’ between the firms and create ‘significant financial synergies’.

The language is business shorthand for cost savings – such as laying off workers.

US firm Pfizer - maker of blockbuster drugs like Viagra and Lipitor - claims its takeover of UK rival AstraZeneca would create a giant British-based drugs company

The warning came in evidence handed to
 MPs ahead of chief executive Ian Read appearing before the business 
committee of the Commons today.

Pfizer
 insists its pledges of a long-term commitment to Britain are ‘tangible,
 legally binding and represent significant investment in the economy, 
skilled workforce and knowledge base of the UK’.

Business Secretary Vince Cable will be grilled by MPs tomorrow over the planned takeover

Downing Street declined to say whether Government lawyers accepted that the pledges were legally watertight.

‘We
 are taking a very robust approach on this because in the event of there
 being an agreement between shareholders we want the very best possible 
deal for the UK, and we will be exploring every way of getting that,’ 
said a No 10 spokesman.

Ministers
 are under pressure to order an inquiry into the deal, following 
warnings that it could have a major impact on British science and jobs.

Authorities
 in the United States and in Sweden, where AstraZeneca has 5,900 staff, 
are also concerned about the potential impact on jobs.

Business Secretary Vince Cable will be pressed by MPs today over whether he plans to call in the deal for scrutiny.

Astra boss Pascal Soirot will also face questioning about the likely impact on his firm of any takeover.

Labour said Pfizer’s promises were ‘not worth the paper they’re written on’.

And
 Sweden’s finance minister Anders Borg has warned Mr Cameron the pledges
 should be taken with a ‘sackful of salt’ as Pfizer reneged on similar 
promises on jobs and investment after its takeover of Pharmacia.

A
 poll last night found that just 14 per cent of the public believe the 
takeover is in Britain’s interests. Only 19 per cent of people think 
ministers are doing enough to protect jobs and skills.

The
 Survation poll for the Unite union found that 74 per cent believe a 
deal on this scale should be subject to a ‘public interest test’ by 
Government – a move that would require a change in the law.

In
 its evidence to the Commons business committee last night Pfizer 
repeated its pledge to continue investment in the UK for at least five 
years.

The Financial Times lent its weight yesterday to the growing criticism of Pfizer’s attempts to take over AstraZeneca.

In its leader column, the influential business newspaper suggested directors at AstraZeneca had a duty to employees and customers as well as to shareholders. 

It said: ‘One of the most troubling aspects of Pfizer’s bid is its lack of evident commercial logic. Pfizer’s dealmaking history is a deeply dispiriting one. 

‘The group has a reputation for delivering returns ... through cost-crunching acquisitions.’

The firm will face 
questions today over how it will reconcile its pledges to Britain with 
its nod to shareholders that the deal will result in massive job cuts 
and savings. David Rutley, Tory MP for Macclesfield, where Astra employs
 2,000 staff, last night urged Pfizer to offer further assurances.

Mr
 Rutley said: ‘Our science base is a vital national asset. This is an 
uncertain time for employees and I want Pfizer to put their cards on the
 table and provide stronger, more enduring commitments.’

City sources are expecting Pfizer to return with a higher bid this week of potentially £60 a share.

An
 offer, worth £10 a share less, has been rejected by the Astra board of 
directors. Mr Read could lose out on a £70million shares windfall if the
 controversial takeover collapses.

As
 Britain’s second biggest drugs company, Astra employs 6,700 staff in 
the UK and accounts for 2.3 per cent of this country’s exports.
