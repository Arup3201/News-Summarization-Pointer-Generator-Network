Blow: Entrepreneur Rob Law was dealt a crushing blow as judges ruled a rival to his Trunki children's suitcase does not infringe on his design rights

An inventor has become the 'Dragons' Den' most successful reject - after selling two million sit-on suitcases.

Entrepreneur Rob Law came up with his idea for the Trunki in 1997 but was turned down when he appeared on the BBC show in 2006.

Despite the rejection, he invested thousands of pounds into developing the product and it is now very popular baggage item among families.

Mr Law, of Clifton, Bristol, now enjoys a turnover of over £7 million a year and his company employs 30 people.

During his first appearance on the programme, he asked for £100,000 in exchange for  a 10 per cent share of his company.

The Dragon's initially took a liking to the product with Deborah Meadon and Theo Paphitis saying it was 'cute'.

He introduced the merchandise as a suitcase 'todllers can pack, sit on and ride... while parents can keep their children in tow.'

But Theo got hold of the product and managed to break one of the straps, leading the rest of the Dragons to question its quality.

He then received the negative verdict of 'I'm out' from all of the judges and left the Den without his desired investment.

Seven years on however, his business has turned into a success story.

This year the firm moved into a new phase when it bought its own factory in Devon and moved production of its suitcases to the UK.

To mark the two-million milestone, Trunki produced two special suitcases complete with gold horns.

A competition has been launched – and more than 1,000 people have signed up on Facebook for the chance to win one of the cases.

Sucessful: Mr Law employs more than 50 people and enjoys a turnover of more than £7 million a year

Practical: Globetrotting children can sit on the suitcase as their parents pull them along

Design: His invention is made from the same material as adult suitcase brands and can be ridden like a toy

Demonstration: He sat on one of his products during his appearance in front of the Dragons in 2006. But he left the Den disappointed as one by one the Dragons declared 'I'm out'

This year has also seen the firm win a major law case against a rival company, and land £4 million worth of funding to help pay for its expansion plans over the coming 12 months.

The factory in Devon was bought a little over a year ago and went into administration almost immediately.

But around 50 jobs were rescued when Magma Moulding, the manufacturing division of Trunki, purchased the factory out of administration.

Mr Law has never regretted the decision to take over the manufacturing side of the business.

He said: 'We had only recently started UK manufacturing when the factory went into administration.'

Test: Former Dragon Richard Farleigh was the first to try the sit-on suitcases

Curious: The Dragons were initially impressed with the product, with Theo and Deborah (second and third from right) calling it 'cute'

Dreams dashed: Mr Law felt the investment slipping away when Theo Paphitis managed to break one of the straps
