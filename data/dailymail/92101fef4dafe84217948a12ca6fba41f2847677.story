New launch: Illegal Magazine is being sold on the streets of London and vendors use the cash raised to pay for drugs

A new Big Issue-inspired magazine sold by drug addicts who can use the £2 profit on each issue  to fund their habit was today criticised by police.

'Illegal!' was launched in east London last week and argues everyone 'has a right' to do what they want with their bodies - even if that means an illegal 'acid trip in Camden' or an 'ecstasy-fuelled night in Shoreditch'.

Sellers, who pay £1.50 per copy, charge £3.50 for it and can tell buyers they will 'more than likely spend the money on drugs'.

Buyers can 'help make them a bit less criminal', the founders say. But it is not clear whether the sellers or the magazine's proprietors are breaking the law. Following the magazine's launch last week, one drug addict sold 100 copies in a few days, pocketing £350.

Its Danish founder Michael Lodberg Olsen has said giving drug addicts access to the magazine will help them get money 'beyond theft and prostitution'.

Louis Jensen, head of Illegal!’s team in London, told MailOnline he met Mr Olsen while filming a documentary - and decided he wanted to bring the magazine to Britain.

Mr Jensen, 26, said: ‘The whole war on drugs is something I've kept a close eye on over the last few years. I really like Michael's ethos, and thought education is lacking in the UK - not just on the drug itself, but how to take it, and on drug users.

‘He'd always had this dream that he wanted to take it to globally - and I said to Michael, “I want to take this to London, let's do this”.

‘There's many misconceptions about drug users. This magazine challenges those misconceptions and stereotypes. It's not necessarily there to create a revenue to spend it on drugs.

‘Michael is creating an alternative to crime and prostitution to generate revenue. He knows at the end of the day that they probably will spend this on drugs, but at least they've been given the option to sell something that doesn't cause them to commit crime.

‘He's a realist, and I'm a realist. We want to hope that the user reads the content and takes certain things on board, and hopefully gets themselves out of the hole they're in - but you know nine out of the ten are probably going to spend it on drugs. There’s that real hope that the one in ten won't.’

He added: ‘I want to create a conversation. Current drug policies clearly don't work. Drug-related crime on the increase. This shouldn't be a judicial issue. This is an educational issue.

‘I've been known to take drugs in the past, but more on a recreational level - it's never something that's been a dependency for me. 

'One of my very close friends happens to be a heavy user, and he is a vendor who sells the magazine in Brixton. I think being involved in this magazine has helped him.’

Mr Olsen added: 'We don’t think the magazine breaks any laws. We have told people that, if someone is unhappy about the magazine being sold near a particular place, then they should move on and not cause any problem.'

Illegal! has sold  around 15,000 copies in Copenhagen and last week 2,000 copies of the English language version of the magazine were handed out to drug addicts in London, who sell them on the street.

The magazine's foreword states: 'Everyone has a right to do with their body as they wish and, if that means a two-day acid trip in Camden or an ecstasy-fuelled night in Shoreditch, then so be it. What we lack is education. Welcome to Illegal! magazine in London.' 

Mr Olsen, editor-in-chief, admitted that he has not yet talked to Scotland Yard about the magazine, but said he was 'planning on doing so'.

Chief Inspector Ian Simpkins, of the Metropolitan Police, said he was 'not a big fan' of the idea.

He said: 'We would always wish to reduce crime and the generators for crime, which funding a drug habit often is of course. This initiative seeks to legitimise and formalise fundraising for illegal drug use which I'm not sure is the answer.

'There is always the risk here of funding and consequently increasing a person's drug use to the point where the selling of the magazine no longer covers the cost or the initiative fails, so you're back to square one, or worse because you're now consuming more drugs with all the health and crime risks that poses.'

MailOnline has asked Scotland Yard if they are investigating whether selling the magazine constitutes illegal activity, but the force is yet to respond. 

Illegal! magazine states in its blurb: 'Whether you smoke dried leaves, sniff coke, inject heroin or neck all the pills you can buy from a pensioner on the street, it's no concern to the police or the prison service, it's a health and social concern.

'Illegal! magazine is a helping hand to those drug users who have become dependent and forced into criminality or prostitution to get their next fix.

'They sell the magazine on the streets of Copenhagen and now London. That's their job. Help them - buy the magazine and make them a bit less criminal.'

Mr Olsen, however, said the aim of the magazine was to spark a debate about drug use.

He said: 'We are challenging the war on drugs. The magazine is about the drug culture, good and bad. The point is that anyone can sell this magazine and we hope that it will spark a debate about drug use.

'We can't just ignore that drugs are everywhere and there are heavy drug users on the streets who often fund their habit through theft or prostitution. This offers them an alternative. It is about breaking the cycle between drug use and crime.' 

Shoreditch resident Jake Furness said the 'very idea' of drug addicts selling magazines on the street specifically to fund their drug addiction was 'ridiculous'.

The 32-year-old IT worker said: 'The whole idea will just lead to a vicious circle of an ever-increasing dependency on drugs.

'Drugs are still illegal in the UK and to blatantly sell magazines which are designed to help fund the purchase of drugs is frankly ridiculous.'

Debra Greaves, 41, said: 'I'll happily buy the Big Issue as it aims to help people, but this magazine is just a money spinner for drug addicts to get more drugs.

'The legality of the whole operation must be questionable and I certainly won't be buying a copy.'
