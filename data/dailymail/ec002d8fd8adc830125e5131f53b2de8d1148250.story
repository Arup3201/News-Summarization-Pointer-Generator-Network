GIGGS WAS A JOY TO WATCH BUT HIS PLACE AMONG THE VERY BEST IS UNCERTAIN

ARSENAL DON'T DESERVE RAMSEY... HE SHOULD PLAY ALONGSIDE BALE

Listening to FA chairman Greg Dyke struggle to pronounce Luis Suarez’s name as he spoke at the Football Writers’ Association Awards last week, it struck me that he might actually not know what he’s talking about.

His passionate belief that we need to find a way to get more English players into Premier League first teams is sound enough: but the logic behind his solution is shambolic at best.

I interviewed Connor Wickham this week, the Sunderland striker who was thrown into the first team by Gus Poyet, and who subsequently rewarded the manager’s faith with the goals that produced the miracle of the great escape at The Stadium of Light.

Faith repaid: English striker Connor Wickham contributed crucial goals as Sunderland escaped the Premier League relegation zone

Right choice: Sunderland manager Gus Poyet opted for Wickham over Jozy Altidore

It might seem like a no-brainer – do you select Wickham or Jozy Altidore?

The American had a spell at Hull City but scored just one Premier League goal and he was sent off in a crucial defeat which virtually sealed the club’s relegation.

Undeterred, Sunderland decided to bring Altidore back to this country on a whopping four-year contract and he has scored one Premier League goal this season.

Some would say Wickham was overpriced at £8.1m - it fits with the myth that English players are too expensive. Well Erik Lamela cost £30m, Roberto Soldado £26m – how have they been getting on?

Joe Hart cost Manchester City £600,000 and Leighton Baines cost Everton just £5.9m from Wigan. These two would get into most top European sides.

English players don’t have to cost a fortune, not if you look hard enough. But even when they do they can be worth it. Wayne Rooney has provided Manchester United with value for money in terms of the transfer fee in the 10 years since his £27m switch from Everton.

There have been some young English players put into Premier League teams this season who have flourished: Jon Flanagan at Liverpool is a great example – he didn’t let anyone down.

Ross Barkley at Everton, Dwight Gayle and Joel Ward at Crystal Palace, Jack Colback and Wickham at Sunderland, Alex Oxlade-Chamberlain at Arsenal, Ravel Morrison at West Ham, and numerous examples at Southampton.

The answer is not to send these players to a new League 3, risking the robust health of the lower divisions.

The answer is to put them into the first teams in the Premier League. It has happened right in front of Dyke’s eyes this season and yet somehow it seems to have passed him by.

Outstanding: Ross Barkley has enjoyed an excellent season with Everton and has subsequently been called up to the England squad for the World Cup

Class: Arsenal's Alex Oxlade-Chamberlain, seen here taking on the Bayern Munich defence, has also impressed in a number of matches

Controversial: Greg Dyke's plans to introduce a League 3 between the Football League and the Conference to help foster young English talent was met with widespread criticism

Wickham scored the winning goal for England Under 17s to win the European Championship in 2010 and he was excellent throughout the whole tournament.

In the course of our conversation, Wickham told me he was surprised that more players from that England squad in 2010 hadn’t made the breakthrough. Last season only Wickham (at the end of the season), Barkley and West Brom’s Saido Berahino played regularly in the Premier League.

Others from that squad have talent and should make the breakthrough next season after serving their time on loan at a lower level: West Brom’s George Thorne is a superb passer of the ball; it’s about time we saw Jack Butland in regular action in the top flight; and I am certain that had Josh McEachran come through at Liverpool or Arsenal he would be a first team regular by now.

The current England Under 17s have made the final again this year – superb goals from Chelsea’s Dominic Solanke and Fulham’s Patrick Roberts won the semi against Portugal.

And the England Under 21s controlled the ball superbly against Wales with Nathan Redmond starring, as he has for Norwich for most of the season.

Clubs like Chelsea need a change in mentality which I think the fans would welcome – watching their most talented teenager Ruben Loftus-Cheek in recent weeks, it’s clear he is surely too good to be ignored. I hope Mourinho shows some bravery and picks him.

And I sincerely hope the fact that Loftus-Cheek is on course to be a millionaire before he even kicks a ball for Chelsea’s first team doesn’t rob him of the hunger to succeed.

Hat-trick hero: Nathan Redmond scored all three goals as England Under 21s beat Wales 3-1 in their latest European Championship qualifier

First team chance? Chelsea's Ruben Loftus-Cheek has been outstanding for their Under-21 and youth teams this season

The answer is right in front of Dyke’s eyes – he doesn’t need Danny Mills’ ludicrous ramblings to help with this one.

Dispel this appalling stereotype that English players have no technique, enforce a rule making clubs put the better homegrown youngsters in the first team, and sit back and enjoy the results.

As Everton have shown with Barkley this season, with the right coaching, the talent will emerge.

The talent is there, it needs the right guidance and coaching - and the stage for it to flourish.
