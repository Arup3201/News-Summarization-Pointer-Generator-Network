He’s been wreaking havoc in Switzerland for weeks, but now a crack team of Austrian hunters have caught the wild bear that developed a taste for picnic food.

The real life Yogi Bear became public enemy number one in the snowy Graubunden region after reports of him raiding beehives and bins and stealing food from unsuspecting campers.

The enormous animal also mistook a skidoo for a giant tasty treat and began tucking in with his powerful teeth. He ripped off large chunks of the ice machine before realising it was inedible.

After launching a bear hunt authorities finally managed to stop the beast in his tracks by shooting it with a tranquiliser gun.

‘Yogi’ has now been set free again, but not before he was fitted with a GPS system to ensure that when he wanders into areas inhabited by humans hunters can shoot him with a special type of rubber bullet to scare him away.

Hannes Jenny from the Hunting and 
Fishing Authorities in Switzerland said: ‘The problem is that the bear 
has lost his fear of human beings.

‘Normal
 rubber bullets don't affect bears but the cartridges we plan to use 
contain lots of small rubber pellets designed to drive the bear off.

‘That should teach him to avoid man in the future.

‘We want him to get his food naturally in the woods.’

Officially the bear is known by his scientific name M13 but unofficially he has become known as ‘Yogi’.

Mr Jenny added: ‘We were able to confirm that it is the same bear that been causing problems elsewhere in the area. He weighs 120 kilos at the moment.’

Prior to the capture and tagging of M13 officials in Austria and Switzerland had warned hikers to be on the lookout for the animal.

Wildlife experts said that the bears were notoriously drowsy after waking up from their long winter sleep and often showed a very bad temper.

M13 had also shown himself to be lazy in simply stealing from man and had probably been confused from his long winter sleep when he tackled the skidoo.

Mr Jenny said it was an unusual exercise for police who had to take DNA samples of the hair left by the bear at the scene in order to help the scientists to identify the beast.
