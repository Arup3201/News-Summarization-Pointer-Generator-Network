A single mom has become a bodybuilding champion after shedding more than 50lbs from her petite 5ft 1in frame.

Civil engineer Nichola Smiles, 31, from Sugar Land, Texas weighed 180lbs and wore a size 14/16 before she made fitness her priority. After seeing how 'swollen' her face looked in photo in 2008, she knew she needed to make a change.

Now Ms Smiles, who maintains a weight of 125lb, is a bodybuilding competitor, a fitness instructor, a personal trainer and a posing coach - in addition to her full-time job.

Fitness solution: After graduating from the University of Houston, Ms Smiles had gained 40lbs (left). Six years later, the 31-year-old maintains a weight of 125lbs (right)

She has kept the pounds off for six years, noting that permanent weight loss is about  'changing your relationship with food'.  

Ms Smiles explained: 'When you get to your final number, you're never done because the hardest part is maintaining.'

When it comes to nutrition, she said: 'It's not about the taste. It's about the fuel.' 

But before she underwent a dramatic physical transformation, Ms Smiles was a young mom and a full-time student struggling with her weight.

Ms Smiles, who gave birth to her son Joshua when she was 15-years-old, noticed that her metabolism started to change in college. 

Although she put on the 'freshman 15' as a student at the University of Houston, she didn't start rapidly gaining weight until after graduation.

Physical training: The civil engineer started doing workout DVDs in her living room before she had the confidence to join a gym. She is currently a group fitness instructor, as well as a person trainer 

Shocking realization: Ms Smiles said she knew she had to make a change after seeing this photo of herself at a friend's wedding in 2008 because she couldn't believe how 'swollen' her faced looked

As a civil engineer with disposable income, Ms Smiles found herself eating out more, traveling for business and indulging at after work happy hours.'

'I wasn't being conscientious of what I was putting in my body,' she said.

Within six months Ms Smiles had put on 40lbs in addition to the weight she had gained in college.

While she was aware that she was buying clothes in bigger sizes, she didn't have an 'aha moment' until she saw an unflattering photo of herself from a friend's wedding in 2008.

'I couldn't believe how swollen my face looked,' she recalled.

Ms Smiles knew her weight was out of control, and it was in her living room that she gradually started to change the shape of her body.

When she found herself watching an infomercial for one of Beachbody's many at home fitness programs, she got off of her couch and started doing the exercises from the commercial.

New priorities: Ms Smiles often ate out and indulged in happy hours after college graduation (left). She now spends her spare time teaching fitness classes and working as a posing coach for other competitors (right)

She later ordered the DVD series and worked out in her home until she felt comfortable enough to join 24 Hour Fitness, a local gym. 

Her first goal was to get down to 145lbs before going on a girls trip to Miami.

But Ms Smiles's weight loss was gradual. It took her six months to lose 30lbs.

'It was more about inches at that time,' she said. 'I didn't want to be the fat friend at the beach.'

Ms Smiles continued to challenge herself after her weight loss started to plateau. She soon made the decision to become a group fitness instructor.

'This entire a process has always been about working on myself,' she noted. 

After maintaining a weight of 130lbs for two years, Ms Smiles began working with personal trainer Dewayne Malone.

Mr Malone taught her how to balance calories as well as fat and carbohydrates. She lost 7lbs within a week of following his meal plan and training. 

The Houston trainer encouraged her to enter her first bodybuilding competition in 2012. Not only did Ms Smiles agree to compete, but she came in fourth place.

Striving for excellence: Ms Smiles (far right) started teaching group fitness classes at 24 Hour Fitness in order to continue to challenge herself

In 2013, Ms Smiles was 117lbs when she placed first in the open figure division at the Musclemania Superbody competition.

While she has weighed as little as 104lbs, she noted it is a weight that is unrealistic for her to maintain.

She instead chooses to stay at a healthy 125lbs throughout the year, so she is able to 'cheat' and go out to eat with her son and her friends.

Before she starts training for a show, she explained that she indulges in a 'last supper', which is usually at Perry's Steakhouse & Grille.

She will then dedicate eight to 12 weeks to '100per cent clean eating' in order to prepare for the competition.

Ms Smiles said that one common misconception is that people think they need to starve themselves to lose weight.

Slow and steady: Ms Smiles (right) said the hardest part of reaching your goal weight is to maintain your weight loss. She said she has 'changed her relationship with food' and has kept the weight off for six years 

Only human: The fitness competitor (right) allows herself to have cheat days when she is not training, so she is able to go out and eat with her family and friends 

'I eat six meals a day,' she said. 'I am always eating.' 

Because she has changed her relationship with food, she said she has no problem eating the same things over and over again.

She quickly rattled off items from her weekly grocery list, which includes oatmeal, egg whites, grape fruit, salmon, tilapia, green beans, Greek yogurt, lean meat and sweet potatoes. 

And while she can happily eat a salad without dressing, she admitted that she is just like everyone else when it comes to cravings.

'I always try to be a fitness inspiration,' she said, 'but I want to tell people I like cookies like any other person. 

She added: 'But I know that I can only have a certain amount of cookies... You can have things if you learn how to balance.'
