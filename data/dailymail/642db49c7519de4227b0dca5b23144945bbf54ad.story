A leading law firm has set up a new service to encourage Bulgarian and Romanian immigrants to cash in on Britain’s compensation culture.

Osbornes Solicitors LLP is offering a tailor-made ‘no win, no fee’ injury claims scheme for the thousands expected to come to Britain when entry controls are lifted at the end of the year.

The firm has hired bilingual advisers so that migrants can submit compensation applications without having to speak English, while its website provides an explanation of how Britain’s compensation system works.

The Romanian-language page says: ‘Find out, free of charge, if you can claim compensation as a result of your accident.

'Furthermore, for the vast majority of our clients we operate a policy of NO WIN, NO FEE!’

A Romanian businesswoman said: ‘Most of the new arrivals will be amazed to find that such a thing exists.’

Stuart Kightley, department head at the firm in Camden, North London, said: ‘The information on our website is simply a statement of how the system works.

'There is nothing wrong with explaining it to people in their own language.’

Up to 35,000 Romanian and Bulgarian nationals could come to Britain next year, according to their ambassadors to the UK.

The British Government has repeatedly refused to put a figure on the likely influx from January 1 2014 when border controls must be abandoned.

Ministers say it is impossible to predict numbers and fear a repeat of the 2004 debacle when the influx from eight other Eastern European countries was grossly underestimated.

There are currently around 130,000 Romanian and Bulgarian nationals living in the UK.
