Sylvia Pritchard, a grandmother to six, died while on a golfing holiday in Turkey

A grandmother holidaying in Turkey died from a brain bleed after she hit her head on a jetty while jumping into the sea.

Sylvia Pritchard, 68, was staying in the Belek region of Turkey when the accident occurred in May.

An inquest heard how the grandmother from Oswestry, Shropshire, was on a golfing holiday with her husband John and four friends.

North Shropshire coroner John Ellery recorded a conclusion of accidental death.

He said: 'I do not believe this was drowning. I believe the head injury came after hitting her head on something hard below the water.'

A post-mortem examination in Turkey had ruled Mrs Pritchard died from drowning. But Mr Ellery overruled that based on a second post-mortem examination held in the UK.

Her friend Beryl Aubrey, who was on holiday with her at the time, recalled: 'I watched her climb down the steps before dropping into the water.

'She surfaced, she took a stroke which was very weak and then she flipped over face down.'

She added: 'Mrs Pritchard was rushed to Serik Hospital where she died.'

Mrs Pritchard's husband, a Vale of Llangollen Golf Club member, said: 'I never saw Sylvia go into the water. I heard Beryl ask if she was okay when she was in the water.

'I went to look and asked if she was okay. I told her to come out of the water and then she flipped over.'

He continued: 'She went into the water and the jetty was quite a long way out. There was a bit of a swell and I think she has gone in and banged her head on something.'

Mrs Pritchard had four children and six grandchildren. She was a former ladiesâ€™ captain at Henlle Golf Club, near Gobowen.
