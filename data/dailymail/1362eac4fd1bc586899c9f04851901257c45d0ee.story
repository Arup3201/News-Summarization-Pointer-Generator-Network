Many supermarket own-brand products are cheap and cheerful, but it seems some are just plain cheap and nasty.

From Asda's porridge to Tesco's coffee, the worst items have been named and shamed in a scathing new report.

While most supermarket makes are good, low cost alternatives to expensive big brands, some should be left on the shelf, it suggests.

Named and shamed: The worst supermarket own-brand products, according to taster Martin Isark

These include diet lemonade from 
Sainsbury's to Lidl's champagne and Asda's tea bags which taste like 
'cabbage water', according to professional food and drink taster Martin 
Isark.

Isark, who runs the 
best-selling consumer app and website CanIEatIt has taste-tested a 
staggering 100,000 products in more than two decades.

He
 said a vast majority of food and drink products sold under a 
supermarket's own label are as good as their more expensive rivals.

But he also picked 11 which should stay where they are because they are not worth putting into a trolley.

Shameful alternatives: Asda's own-brand porridge (left) has been condemned as 'sludge' while its tea bags were described as tasting like 'cabbage water' by professional food and drink tester Martin Isark

'Like this coffee? Not this jar!' Tesco's Everyday Value coffee (left) was also savaged as was Sainsbury's own ketchup, which Mr Isark said would ruin your chips

Rubbish: Tesco's sugar-free cola was best 'left on the shelf' and the Sainsbury's cheese and tomato pizza would not even please a cash-strapped student, according to Mr Isark

Own brands are big business in 
Britain these days with canny consumers spending a record £118.1 billion
 a year on them, up more than 50 per cent in the last five years.

'They
 may be cheap but if they taste awful then they do not represent good 
value. And there are usually better alternatives that will not harm your
 wallet'

Martin Isark, food and drink taster

Around four in ten of all retail sales are now own label products, representing good value and, in most cases, good tastes.

But
 among those which should remain on the shelves are Asda Smart Price 
Porridge Owns which he gives a 3/10 rating and describes as 'tasteless 
white sludge.'

Martin Isark 
said: 'They may be cheap but if they taste awful then they do not 
represent good value. And there are usually better alternatives that 
will not harm your wallet.

'I
 have spent two decades tasting more than 100,000 food and drink 
products and out of those, these are the ones I would urge consumers to 
avoid.'

'Like animal cereal': Sainsbury's was also criticised for the quality of its cornflakes (left) and lemonade (right), of which he said: 'Don't bother buying it'

Give them a miss: 'Tongue-curling fizz' Comte de Brismand at Lidl (left) and 'belly filler, but tastewise a non-starter' Asda Smart Price Brown Bread (right) were also criticised
