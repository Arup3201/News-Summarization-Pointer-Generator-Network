A widow claims her house has been turned into a 'goldfish bowl' by a 60ft high school being built yards away.

Pamela Burbery, 76, says her life has been ruined by the new development which dwarfs her four-bedroom detached home in Bordesley Green, Birmingham.

Many classrooms overlook the property and pupils will be able to stare straight into her bedroom, because their new school stands just 20ft from the bottom of her garden.

Living in a goldfish bowl: The New Waverley School looms over Pamela Burbery and her house, which she claims will ruin her life

The grandmother-of-eight has been unable to sell her £240,000 home after buyers were put off by the fact that students will be able to see everything going on there.

Retired receptionist Pamela and her late husband Ray, who died this year
aged 77, battled the council for three years before the building work 
began.

Mrs Burbery says she cannot continue to live in the shadow of the New Waverley School - which will cater for 2,000 pupils from January.

'I am dreading the school term because I know that it won’t be long before literally thousands of pupils will be overlooking my house,' she said.

'Almost every classroom will have a birds-eye-view of my bedroom and I’ve worked it out that I won’t even be able to make a cup of tea without being watched.

'I feel like I’m under siege. Since my husband passed away this year I’ve been trying to sell up but no one wants to buy because of the new school being built.

'There’s going to be 2,000 children there, there’s going to be three playgrounds. It’s enormous.

'When I complained to the council I was told not to worry because the pupils will be facing the other way but that’s not the point - my home will be like a goldfish bowl with nowhere to hide.

'We’ve had some good weather this summer but I can’t go out in the garden and I can’t hang washing out because the builders are all there.

'And it will be the same when all the children are there. I haven’t been in my garden for 12 months and it’s not going to change now.

'The school overlooks my house, it’s at least 60ft high. I used to look out over fields but now I’m going to be viewed from wherever I am in my house.

'Lots of the windows look over my garden and into my house. If I am standing inside by my french windows then they can see me.'

Birmingham City Council granted planning permission to build the school on allotments at the back of her property 12 months ago.

Deborah Carpenter, Pamela’s daughter, said: 'We’re just nothing to the council, it’s a joke how people can be treated like this.

'They just sit there shrugging their shoulders.

'It’s absolutely disgusting what can be done to a 76-year-old woman.

'The council should have bought my mum’s house under a compulsory purchase order.'

Disruption: Since planning permission was granted a year ago the building has sprung up at an incredible pace

Blot: This digger shows just how close the work has been to the grandmother-of-eight's home

Council bosses have maintained that the plans were passed after consultation with residents.

A planning report to members recommended approval on the grounds that it was far enough away from houses and would not result in extra traffic.
