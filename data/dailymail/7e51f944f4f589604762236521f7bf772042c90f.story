Possible ban: Miniskirts could be prohibited in SOuth Korea after President Park Geun-hye approved a government decree, meaning that those deemed to be overexposed in public will be subject to a fine of 50,000 KRW (£30)

Miniskirts could be banned in South Korea as a controversial 'overexposure law' comes into effect this week.

Those deemed to be overexposed in public will face a fine of 50,000 KRW (£30) under the new law.

But the law has been met with criticism after being passed by new president President Park Geun-hye at her first Cabinet meeting.

Celebrities from the Asian country have posted pictures of themselves wearing provocative clothing online, while others have suggested the law could signify a wave of authoritarian rule.

Opposition leaders also criticised the move, describing it as curtailing freedom of expression.

A comparison has been drawn between the president and her late father Park Chung-hee, who was in charge of the country between 1963 and 1979.

Under his leadership, lengthy skirts were prohibited in the 1970s, with those that ended 20 centimetres or more above the knee banned.

Democratic United Party member Ki Sik Kim wrote on Twitter: 'Why does the state interfere with how
 citizens dress?

'Park Geun-hye's government gives 
cause for concern that we are returning to the era when hair length and 
skirt length were regulated.'

Mini skirts are a fashion staple amongst South Korean females, particularly due to K-pop singers - a popular musical genre that emerged from the country.

Nancy Land, a well-known television personality and performance artist, posted a picture of herself on Twitter in response to the law holding a 50,000 KRW note next to her cleavage.

Pop singer Lee Hyori wrote on Twitter: 'Is the overexposure fine for real? I'm so dead.'

But despite the widespread criticism, police said that the law relates to nudity and public indecency and does not involve clothing.

The National Police Agency's Inspector Ko Jun-ho told CNN: 'Any reports that we will be regulating what people are wearing are completely false.'

Opposition politicians have also been accused of spreading 'misinformation', with the Government saying promising to publicise the exact nature of the law and how it will be implemented.
