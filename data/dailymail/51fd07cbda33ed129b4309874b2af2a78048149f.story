We’ve had a pickled cow, that unmade bed and a shed which turned into a boat.

But, doggone it, in the roll call of  barking mad contenders for the Turner Prize, this stuffed Jack Russell surely takes the biscuit.

Standing on its hind legs, holding a placard in its paws declaring ‘I’M DEAD’, the expertly preserved terrier is the work of David Shrigley.

Award: I'm Dead (2010) by David Shrigley, who was today nominated for the Turner Prize

Light-hearted: Mr Shrigley is known for his whimsical cartoons, such as Headless Drummer (2010)

It was among the exhibits for which he was yesterday shortlisted for the prestigious £25,000 art prize.

The jury said his canine creation highlights ‘the farcicalities of life’ and typifies how he is ‘a master at blending humour and cynicism with the macabre’.

It added: ‘He leaves the audience with what he calls a “moral conundrum” – to laugh or not to at someone’s dead pet?’

Shrigley, 44, the doting owner of a  miniature schnauzer, did not stuff the terrier but gave a taxidermist precise instructions. Ladbrokes have now made ‘I’m Dead’ the 2/1 favourite to win.

Favourite: Mr Shrigley, whose work includes Untitled (2012), pictured, is considered most likely to win

Morbid: Much of Mr Shrigley's work deals with the topic of death, including Gravestone (2008)

Although better known for his cartoons and drawings, Shrigley has created other stuffed artworks, including a headless squirrel entitled Nutless.

His interest in taxidermy stems from its ‘perversity’. He said: ‘These animals represent a memorial of a living thing. It’s not like a gravestone, but a naturalistic sculpture using parts of themselves.’

A gravestone is, however, featured in the Brain Activity exhibition which earned his place on the shortlist.

The granite block is engraved with a gold leaf shopping list: ‘Bread, Milk, Cornflakes, Baked Beans, Tomatoes, Aspirin, Biscuits.’

The jury saw it as ‘a comment on the mundane practices of consumption and organisation that we rely on to make our way through life’.

Art? One controversial nominee is Tino Seghal, centre, whose works involve setting up conversations between strangers

Installation: Wantee (2013) is an artwork by Laure Prouvost, another contender for the prize

In a varied career, Shrigley has been on the ‘Young British Artists’ scene for more than a decade.

Announcing the shortlist at Tate Britain, central London, the gallery’s director Penelope Curtis said: ‘We felt he’d been overlooked for a long time because it was felt his work was just funny.

‘But it is more than that – just because it’s funny doesn’t mean it’s not good.’

Sensual: Farfromwords (2013) by Ms Prouvost features erotic shapes with an intimate soundtrack of whispers

Unusual: Another section of Ms Prouvost's Wantee, part of her portfolio nominated for the award

Also on the shortlist is Tino Sehgal, 36, a British-German artist nominated for his ‘live encounters’, such as dancers singing in a blackened room.

Juror and art critic Declan Long admitted some might struggle to accept it as art. He added: ‘But it’s exciting people will be able to see something other than what they might be familiar with as art.’

Traditional: But the subjects of Complication (2013) by Lynette Yiadom-Boakye are imaginary people

Painter: Ms Yiadom-Boakye, whose work Midnight, Cadiz (2013) is pictured, is the first black woman ever to be shortlisted for the Turner Prize

Also vying for the prize are the first black woman to be shortlisted, Lynette Yiadom-Boakye, who paints ‘imaginary’ portraits, and installation artist Laure Prouvost.

For the first time, the winner will be announced outside England. Londonderry, the UK City of Culture 2013, hosts the ceremony on December 2.
