Burnley are facing up to the prospect of losing Danny Ings in the next five months for as little as £206,000.

The Clarets are heavily indebted to their striker’s goals so far this season but, with a number of European clubs chasing the 22-year-old, are destined to part ways.

Ings has netted six times for Sean Dyche’s side – five of which have contributed directly to the winning of points – and Sportsmail understands he is receptive to a move abroad in a bid to broaden his career.

Danny Ings has scored six goals for Burnley this season but he may still ending up leaving the club

A number of clubs in Germany’s Bundesliga are interested in landing Ings, while the Independent claim he is a target for David Moyes at Real Sociedad.

Moyes would not be drawn on any interest on Friday, saying: 'I can't comment on individual players because I don't want to destabilise my club or another club, but I do know that Loren (Juarros, sporting director) and Jokin (Aperribay, club president) are working very hard to bring in players.'

The former Bournemouth man is available on a free transfer at the end of the season, with Burnley so far failing to tie him down to a new contract.

While the Premier League new boys are still due a sizeable cash windfall should Ings move to another English club, that is not the case should he seal a switch elsewhere.

Premier League teams would have to pay as much as £6million for Ings if they took him on a free

Any European team can land the England Under 21 international for a measly £206,000 because of FIFA compensation rules – worked out due to the number of seasons Ings has played at Turf Moor.

He has been free to talk to clubs on the continent from the beginning of the month and is due a chunky signing-on fee if he clinches a move away.

Premier League teams would have to pay as much as £6million if they took him on a free.

Unlike many other young English players, Ings doesn’t feel he necessarily has to be plying his trade in the domestic top flight.
