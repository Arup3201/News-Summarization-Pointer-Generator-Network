Pomp and pageantry turned to embarrassment for London's Lord Mayor when the wheels came off his inauguration parade.

Alderman Roger Gifford's debut outing through the capital ground to a halt in front of thousands of well-wishers because of a fault with the wooden wheels on the 18th Century horse-drawn carriage he was travelling in.

The Alderman had to complete the ceremonial parade - marking the inauguration of the 685th Lord Mayor of the City of London - in an open top Land Rover as the golden coach was towed away.

Not going to plan: The coach ground to a halt because a fault with a wooden wheel

The origins of the Lord Mayor’s coach date back to the mid-18th Century although 
the reason why a coach is used go back some years earlier – to 1711 - 
when then Lord Mayor Sir Gilbert Heathcote fell off the horse he was 
riding in the procession and broke his leg. Up until the 1420s, the Lord
Mayor rode all the way to the Palace of Westminster to swear fealty to 
the monarch – after that they went on a river barge down the Thames, a 
practice which continued until 1857.

A
stand-in coach was used for some years after Sir Gilbert’s fall, and in
1757 Sir Charles Asgill, a banker who was set to be the next Lord 
Mayor, commissioned Joseph Berry of Leather Lane in Holborn to make the 
vehicle still in use today.

But there were no such problems for Olympic gold medalist Jessica Ennis, who joined the parade in a Jaguar F-Type sports car.

A spokesman for the City of London 
Corporation said there was a 'seizure' of one of the rear left axle.

He added: ‘The 250-year-old coach broke down on the return 
journey from the Royal Courts of Justice to Mansion House.

'The
new Lord Mayor took office yesterday, and this was his first 
outing.

'He was taken safely home to Mansion House, where he now lives for 
the year, by the Pageant Master Dominic Reid.'

He added: 'It's the most heavily used 18th-century carriage in the world.'

Before the parade started, Mr Gifford 
arrived in the City on the royal barge Gloriana as it made its third 
official outing this year following the Jubilee pageant and Olympic 
Torch Relay.

This year's Lord Mayor's Show showcased the talents of 6,500 people, 18 vintage cars, a tank and a steamroller, among others.

The parade route was three-and-a-half miles long and passed through Bank and Aldwych.

Mr Gifford was elected in October and said he hoped all onlookers had a 'splendid' day.
