The elegant dress displays explore how the royal figures and fashions were representative of the 
spirit of each decade, reflecting and inspiring everyday trends. 

The exhibition is entitled Fashion 
Rules: Dress from the collections of HM The Queen, Princess Margaret and
 Diana, Princess of Wales and chronicles how royal style has evolved from classic, to daring 
and demure, over four decades.

Starting with the young Queen Elizabeth 
in the 50s, the display will look at her evolving style and the way she 
incorporated the character of the age and the countries she visited in 
the clothes she wore.

In the 60s and 70s parts of the 
exhibition attention will turn to Princess Margaret, the Queen’s younger
 sister, and explore how her style reflected the playful times of a 
modern era.

For the 80’s and 90’s the style of Diana, Princess of Wales is showcased.

As one of the most photographed women
 in the world, Diana had a significant impact on British style and 
fashion that still endures in our memories of her today.

Surrounded by contemporary 
photography, film and music this colourful and exuberant exhibition will
 provide visitors with a real sense of the times in which the clothes 
were worn and how they reflected and inspired everyday fashions, 
offering a nostalgic glance back at recent decades.

King’s and Queen’s State Apartments, Fashion Rules: Dress from the 
collections of HM The Queen, Princess Margaret and Diana, Princess of 
Wales aims to ensure the full 300 years of royal history is bought 
spectacularly to life in what they hope to be a popular summer
