Heather Watson's preparation for the Australian Open remained on track as she beat Sloane Stephens to reach the quarter-finals of the Hobart International.

The 22-year-old world No 49 needed a little over an hour to dispatch American Stephens 6-3 6-1 and the Briton will next play Roberta Vinci.

The Italian two-time US Open quarter-finalist fought back to beat Annika Beck of Germany 3-6 6-3 6-3.

Kurumi Nara ended Johanna Larsson's challenge with a 7-6 (7/1) 6-4 triumph and the Japanese will now challenge either third seed Camila Giorgi or Kaia Kanepi for a semi-final place.
