It is a sight which will touch even the coldest of hearts.

Like any child, this albino whale calf is sticking close to its protective mother.

These incredible aerial photographs were taken off the coast of Botany Bay in Sydney, Australia.

The baby will be feeding heavily from its mother as it lays down fat stores for the 'cold Antarctic waters'.

The white calf is believed to be the offspring of the famous albino Humpback whale known as 'Migaloo'.

The name is an Aboriginal word meaning 'whitefella'.

Migaloo is the world's best-known all-white humpback and has built up a loyal following in Australia since first being sighted in 1991.

Australia's east coast humpback population has been brought back from the brink of extinction following the halting of whaling in the early 1960s.

Migaloo was last officially sighted by a cargo ship crew on August 10 around 6 miles north of Pipon Island, in far north Queensland, according to the White Whale Research Centre.
