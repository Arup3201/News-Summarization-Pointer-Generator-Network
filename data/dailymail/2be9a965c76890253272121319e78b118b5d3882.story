Murderer Johnnie Allan wrote to the 21-year-old student after he saw her reading on the famous Carols From King's service broadcast on Christmas Eve

A 'shaken' female student fears for her safety after receiving a chilling letter from a convicted killer.

Notorious murderer Johnnie Allan, 45, sent the revealing letter from maximum security Long Lartin Prison because he saw the 21-year-old student – who wants to remain anonymous – reading on the famous Carols From King's service broadcast on Christmas Eve.

He was able to track her down after seeing the young woman's name on the BBC 2 programme's credits.

It was delivered after Mr Allan simply wrote her name above the address of the University of Cambridge on an envelope. 

Mr Allan – who was found guilty of a multi-million pound drug plot in 1997 and the murder of a fellow suspect – sent the letter after the student's 'beautiful reading […] touched [his] heart.' 

On December 29 he wrote from the prison in Evesham, Worcestershire, joking: 'I doubt I can convince you to swap places?'

He writes: 'I found you tweaking my imagination after seeing and hearing you.

'Trapped inside my concrete cube I decided to send you this speculative (almost message-in-a-bottle) type letter, taking the million-to-one chance you might be interested.

'This message could: a) Spark off a stimulating connection; b) Make you turn my envelope into a paper aeroplane floating into your wastebin.'

And it looks like Allan, who describes himself as a 'naughty but nice' prisoner who 'likes to communicate' is starting a campaign.

He adds: 'I could lay in my cell and remain paralyzed by the situation or I can try to influence my future by starting a campaign of writing to people.'

Allan claims: 'After I tried to expose high level police corruption I actually became their prime target to silence and cover their ass…

 'They fabricated and manipulated evidence using extreme tactics of fear, threat, promise and misinformation utilizing techniques developed during 'PROJECT MKULTRA,' 'KUBARK' and more recently 'Persistent Adversity' methods employed by the CIA.'

The baffled King's third year said: 'After reading a couple of lines I realised what the letter was and totally freaked out.

'I ran to my friends and had to ask them to read the rest of it for me. I was shaking like a leaf.

'I was terrified - I never expected to get anything like this. I can't believe he's allowed to do this. I'm not even sure how he managed to write to me. 

'I didn't think people serving life could just send letters out to random people.  

'I was in a state of shock at first.

'I've just about got over it now and find it funny. But I do worry for my safety.'

The student broke down when she realised the four-page hand-written note had been penned by killer Johnnie Allen, currently serving life

The convicted murderer wrote in his letter that the student's reading had 'touched his heart' and 'tweaked his imagination

Murderer Johnnie Allen has his a profile on the PenPals Behind Bars website where he describes himself as a 'naughty but nice' prisoner who 'likes to communicate' 

According to the PenPals Behind Bars, Allan could be released as early as next year.

Johnnie Allan, 50, was convicted in 1997 of an £8 million drugs conspiracy. 

Six years later, he was also convicted of the murder of his co-defendant in the drugs case.

He is currently serving a life sentence at Long Lartin prison in Worcestershire.

But according to PenPals Behind Bars website, Allan - who previously claimed he had been training in prison to become a drugs counsellor, could be released as early as next year.

It is not the first time the convict has written. 

Allan had struck up a bizarre friendship with heiress Eva Rausing after he sent her a letter.

Their correspondence lasted four years and Eva laid her innermost thoughts bare to the notorious jailed killer in dozens of letters.

In one letter on March 1, she even told the convict he was 'the only person I talk to.'

His pitiable plea describes the fortified prison as 'a metropolis of men without women, a beehive without honey, caged loneliness without privacy, a farm where all the sheep are classified as black, a cement park with barbed-wire trees and an enormous microscope under which shrinks study the smear from civilisation's ulcers.

'This prison is a place of punishment, pain, gladiatorial entertainment, stigma, labels, loss, cover-ups, state secrets, metapathologies and despair.' 

Allan isn't the only one to randomly get in touch. 

She explained: 'I've got no fewer than ten friends requests from mostly creepy guys.

'Clearly, going on TV like this only leads to a cornucopia of harassment.

'It's mostly been amusing and quite flattering but this letter is more extreme than anything I expected.'

She added that she hopes 'never to be contacted by him again'.

The Ministry of Justice said Allan's letter did not break any rules, but if the student complains he will be barred from writing to her again.  

Other readers at the service watched by millions report similar experiences but this is the only instance of criminal interaction.
