America's oldest person has passed away in her Clearwater, Florida, home, just weeks before her 114th birthday.

Born on April 5, 1899, Elsie Calvert Thompson was the fourth-oldest person in the world. She died peacefully on March 21 and her family held a memorial service in Clearwater. Her ashes will be buried in Pennsylvania, next to her late husband.

Thompson's only child George Thompson, 72, said she died as he flew from his home in California to see her. She had congestive heart failure.

'She had such a big heart,' he toldÂ The Tampa Bay Times on Sunday. 'She was such a large person.'

Thompson passed the baton to Jeralean Talley, who was born on May 23, 1899. As well as being the oldest person in the US, Talley, from Inkster, Michigan, is the oldest living black person and credits 'the Lord' as her secret to a long life.

Thompson was born during the administration of President William McKinley and just a year after the close of the Spanish-American War.

She was a stylish dresser who enjoyed ballroom dancing until shortly before her death. She also loved to sing and play the piano, the Times reported.

Susie Harper, 59, Thompson's caregiver of 13 years, said she never saw the elderly woman in a bad mood.

Secret: At age 111, Thompson divulged the secret to longevity: 'I love people,' she said

In fact, Harper said the 113-year-old 
told the Times she glided from bed every morning with a smile and was a 
'tireless hostess' who always offered guests food and drink despite 
being well over a century old.

'She would wake up and say, "Oh my, 
won't you look outside? Isn't it beautiful?" And if it was raining, she 
would say, "That's okay, we'll make our own sunshine,"' Harper said.

Thompson
 had been in the record books for her remarkable age for four years 
before she won the distinguished title of being the oldest living 
American.

At age 111, Thompson divulged the secret to longevity.

'I love people,' she told the Times back then.

She always loved entertaining and 
welcoming to visitors, but she wasn't able to celebrate earning her new 
title of America's oldest person in January as she had been advised to avoid outside contact 
because of the flu epidemic.

Big milestone: Elsie Thompson, pictured on her last birthday, was just weeks shy of turning 114

Those steps are seen as wise by many, as two of the previous title-holders died as a result of infections last month.

Both 116-year-old Besse Cooper and 115-year-old Dina Manfredini died in December.

Reporters from The Tampa Bay Times
 met with Thompson on her 111th, 112th, and 113th birthdays, but the flu
 precautions kept them away when she earned her title recently.

Thompson was known for having a zest for life that many did not expect of someone her age.

'You'll say, "Elsie, honey, you wanna get up?" And she'll say, "You betcha." Sometimes she'll talk and talk,' Harper said of the woman in January.

Harper had worked with Thompson for the past 13 years as she continued to live in her own condominium in Clearwater, Florida as opposed to an assisted living facility.

'Sometimes when she's tired, she 
doesn't want to say anything. But she has a happy and uplifting spirit 
about her,' Ms Harper told The Tampa Bay Times.

Thompson is one of the only 14 people left on Earth who were on the planet during the 19th century.

Thompson stopped traveling to California to visit her son and his family son time before her death.

He initially pushed for her to move to be nearer to him and his family when his father- her longtime husband- died in 1986, but she opted to stay in Florida.

'It has continued to work because she's well taken care of,' he told The Tampa Bay Times in January.

'It's a different world here, and she's so familiar with everything there. You should see how she gets around her apartment. She knows exactly where everything is.'
