A rich retired accountant allegedly killed by a Russian prostitute at his £1million Surrey home was planning to ask her to marry him, a court has heard.

Winston Fernandez, 69, wanted to propose to the vice girl now accused of his murder, Natalia Woolley, 38, as long as she gave up working as an escort, the jury was told.

The evidence emerged at Guildford Crown Court when transcripts of a police interview after the defendant was arrested were read out in court.

'Alluring to all men': Natalia Woolley, 38, who described 
herself on escort websites as 'incredibly sexy 
and curvacious', is accused of killing 69-year-old Winston Fernandez - who wanted to marry her, a court heard

DC Adam Ramiz said that Russian-born Woolley, who worked for an escort agency using the names of Lenka and Alice, had performed sexual services for the alcoholic pensioner - and Fernandez had posted enthusiastic comments about her performance on a website.

'He was thinking about asking her to marry him but that she would have to stop being a call girl,' DC Ramiz said.

Mr Fernandez had booked Woolley three times 
previously via an escort agency and even wrote an online review praising
 her ‘aesthetic curves’ after ‘eight amazing hours’.

He
 wrote: ‘All good – nay, outstanding. It is a pleasure to be with you 
every time! I have been addicted to you, I will spend [a] lifetime with 
you!!’

The court heard how his impressions of the £600 a night prostitute changed on the day he died.

Moments before violence erupted at his four bedroom detached home, he accused her of taking his money and not doing anything for him, jurors were told.

Mr Fernandez is alleged to have told Woolley: 'I paid you the money and you didn’t do anything'.

The crown court was told that when the defendant arrived at Mr. Fernandez’s home, she found him drunk and in a very weird mood and Fernandez swung a wine bottle at her.

'I tried to grab the wine bottle,' she said, adding 'He didn’t seem to know what he was doing'.

She said he then grabbed a bottle of beer and tried to smash it over the table.

'What are you doing? Glass could get into my eyes and I could be blind for the rest of my life,' she said.

'I thought if he is doing this and doesn’t know what he is doing I had better leave. I was very scared, I said "Open the door otherwise I shall shout and scream".'

She said she then went upstairs and he finally agreed to unlock the front door but then she alleged that Mr. Fernandez had grabbed her leg and tried to stop her escaping.

She said she kicked him in his middle and stepped over the pensioner as he was on the ground but in the skuffle that followed she stumbled and her leg landed on his head.

The defendant said she then left the house and walked to a nearby garage where she called a cab to take her back home to London.

'Sexy and curvaceous': The call girl - who plied her trade under the aliases Lenka and Alice - is alleged to have broken 17 of the old man's ribs and fractured the bones in his windpipe in the brutal assault before cutting his phone lines as she left

Scene: Woolley was convicted of the manslaughter of 69-year-old Winston Fernandez with her cowboy boots after he invited her to his £1million mansion (above) in Epsom, Surrey, for sex

Jurors heard previously she repeatedly kicked, punched and stamped on her client before cutting the telephone lines and leaving him for dead.

Prosecutor William Saunders claimed Woolley repeatedly beat the pensioner and left him dead or dying with injuries all over his body, including 17 fractured ribs and two broken bones in his larynx.

Mr Saunders added: ‘These injuries would have left him unable to move, in obvious pain, and of course he would have had difficulties in breathing as well.’

Mr Fernandez turned to drink and escort girls after the death of his wife Joan 12 years ago, Guildford Crown Court was told.

Police found Mr Fernandez’s decomposing body slumped against his bed a month later – on February 13 – after a neighbour raised the alarm.

Woolley was arrested on April 2 and when police raided her home they seized her cowboy boots among other items.

She denies murder.

The trial continues.
