Shocking footage has emerged of a girl as young as eight speaking of her love for Jihad and the Syrian uprising during a video filmed at a Muslim conference in Sydney.

The little girl made the controversial comments as she addressed a crowd at an Islamic gathering, while the Australian city continued to deal with the fallout from violent riots at the weekend.

The girl - named only as eight-year-old Ruqaya - was filmed speaking during a 'Muslims Rise' conference held by the Australian chapter of Hizb ut-Tahrir in Bankstown, west Sydney.

Authorities are now investigating the background of the little girl, who was filmed describing her love of jihad - a holy war or spiritual struggle - as well as the violent uprising in Syria and the global community, which is known as Ummah, it was reported.

According to 9News, the video shows the little girl saying: 'These uprisings have demonstrated 
that this Ummah is alive and well, that her sentiments are for Islam, 
her love is for Jihad, she has unshackled herself from the fear which 
she held.

'Children as young as myself can be 
seen on the streets joining the uprisings, risking their lives to bring 
food, water and medicine to their wounded family members, some of them 
never returning to their mothers ... Nobody is too young.'

Sydney was the scene of violent rioting at the weekend - the latest city to be affected by demonstrations across the world against a U.S.-produced anti-Islam film.

Demonstrators clashed with police in the Australian city, with 17 injured and six arrested and charged on Saturday.

Worringly, young children were also seen holding posters with inflammatory slogans on them.

Pru
Goward, the family and Community Services Minister, has been ordered by
New South Wales Premier Barry O'Farrell to urgently investigate the 
presence of a child at the protest, who was pictured holding posters 
ordering the beheading of anyone opposing the prophet.

According to 9News, Ms Goward said: 'We
cannot incite our children to violence for any reason, and we cannot 
use our children to promote messages that incite people to violence.

Detectives
are now hunting the organisers of the riots, who are thought to have 
used text messages and social networking sites to bring demonstrators 
together to 'defend the honour of the Prophet.
