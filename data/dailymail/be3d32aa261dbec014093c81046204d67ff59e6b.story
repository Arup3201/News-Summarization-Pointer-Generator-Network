Jon Venables could be the father of a woman's son

A mother has revealed how she fears James Bulger murderer Jon Venables may be her son's father.

She suspects that she briefly dated the child killer while unaware of his true identity.

But after seeing recent pictures that claim to be Venables, she was horrified when she recognised the resemblance between him and her former lover.

She believes she briefly dated Venables - who was given a different identity on release - in 2008 after he had been released from custody for the murder of toddler James.

The relationship abruptly ended before she gave birth after she discovered he was a Schedule One offender – a person who has been convicted of the worst crimes against children.

She told The Mirror she had no idea of his true identity or the exact nature of his offences.

When social services warned her that her then-boyfriend was a risk to children, she broke off their relationship, and has never heard from him since.

Social workers have warned her not to put the name of the father on her child's birth certificate.

She was appalled when she realised her son's father could be the same person as the man who tortured and killed two-year-old James in Liverpool.

'The pictures were basically the same. Except in the pictures I had he was smaller, weight wise.

'It was a bit of a shock to me. I would never have put two and two together.'

The unnamed woman is believed to have met the father of her child on a dating website, when he was 26.

CCTV footage caught child murderers Jon Venables and Robert Thompson taking James away. Venables may have fathered a child of his own

The fatal moment: Bulger holds the hand of Jon Venables, who led him away

Murderer: Robert Thompson led James away and killed him

Venables
and his friend Robert Thompson were only ten when they abducted, 
tortured and murdered two-year-old James Bulger in Bootle, Merseyside in
1993.

They were released on licence in 2001 and given new identities.

They are protected by an injunction granting them lifelong anonymity for fear of revenge attacks.

Venables was jailed again for two years in July 2010 after pleading guilty to downloading and distributing child pornography.

In another case, Venables attempted to seduce a mother-of-one over the internet by sending her flattering messages.

Sarah Finn, 36, unknowingly exchanged dozens of online messages and texts with James Bulger's killer.

They would chat about rock music, festivals and partying.

Venables told her he loved the Pirates of the Caribbean films and the rock band, Muse.

He sent flattering messages and texts to her and tried to persuade her to meet up with him but Miss Finn, who has a 10-year-old son, never accepted his invitations.

Miss Finn eased off on their online relationship after Venables' messages became increasingly sexual, culminating in him sending her a photograph of his penis.

Venables has served his child pornography sentence and a parole hearing is scheduled to take place within the next couple of months.
