North Dakota often tops the lists when it comes to binge drinking, so it may not be too much of a surprise when told the state also has the most bars per capita in the United States.

There's one bar for every 1,621 North Dakotans.The state comes just ahead of neighboring Montana.

According to Census Data gathered in 2011, there are 422 bars in North Dakota.

The stats: North Dakota leads US in ratio of bars to residents with Virginia bringing up the rear

With a population under 700,000, that gives the state its title.

Whilst North Dakota has topped lists 
for binge drinking and teen drinking in the past some have suggested 
that rural demographics could be one reason why people take to the 
bottle.

Put simply, there's not really very much to do there.

Heading
 out for drink after work or on the weekend is a popular thing to do in 
virtually every city in the country, but in North Dakota, it's not just a
 way to pass time, sit down and have a beer; it is the centre of many 
communities.

Jason Stein, 
Bar Manager of the Supper Club and Lounge in Davenport isn't shocked. 
'It's not surprising at all. There's not much else to do here.'

'It's kind of a centerpiece. There really isn't anything else to do in a town of like 200 people,' he tells ABC 6.

After considering statistics on binge drinking and drunken driving, Pam Sagness told The Forum that North Dakota’s spot on that list was no surprise.

Sagness,
 prevention administrator for the Mental Health and Substance Abuse 
division of the state health department, said easy access is one of the 
driving factors behind North Dakota’s track record of problems with 
alcohol abuse.

North Dakota: People like to drink here because there's not really much else to do...

A pair of 
2010 studies from the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention showed 
that North Dakotans binge drink more often – and in greater quantities –
 than almost all Americans.

Perhaps
 more alarming, Sagness said, is that North Dakotans don’t see much harm
 in binge drinking. She guessed that the North Dakotan attitude of 'work
 hard, play hard' steadily drove up the ratio of bars to residents.

'It didn’t get to be this way overnight,' Sagness said.

Laura Mio grew up in the Midwest, so she wasn’t surprised to hear that North Dakota ranks first in bars per capita in the U.S.

'The joke was, you have to have as many bars as churches – if not more,' said Mio, now general manager at JL Beers in downtown Fargo.

Fargo, the state capital, stands out across the country for alcohol hotspots.

Across state lines: Things are not much better in Montana, the 2nd booziest state in the nation with one bar for every 1,658 Montanans

Sagness said part of the access problem in North Dakota is that there is no statewide agency regulating alcohol – it’s left up to local governments to dole out liquor licenses.

Janet Seaworth, executive director of the North Dakota Beer Wholesalers Association, said she thinks the state’s approach to regulating alcohol has proven effective.

Bruce Schauer at the Wild Rice Grill and Bar agrees. He says they serve the community much more than just cold beverages.

'In rural communities, the local bar and grill is really the only place you can go to eat, and the food sales are usually about the same as the liquor sales.'

Montana comes in second list of bars to people. With just under a million state residents there is one bar per 1,658 members of the population.

At the other end of the pile, Virginia comes in bottom with 125 bars in the entire state, for nearly 8 million people.

New Hampshire doesn't fare much better. Although the state is small by comparison, there are just 38 bars split between 1.3 million residents.
