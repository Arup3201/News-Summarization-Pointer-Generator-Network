William Hague will tomorrow  launch a worldwide network of  British Commonwealth embassies to rival the emergence of the EU as a foreign superpower.

The Foreign Secretary is in  Canada where he will sign an agreement to open joint UK-Canadian  diplomatic missions abroad.

He also hopes Australia and New Zealand will join the initiative whereby the four countries will pool their resources to extend their combined influence on world affairs.

Hitting back: Williams Hague hopes to secure Britain's place as a world power

The move by Eurosceptic Mr Hague is seen as a counter to the EU’s fast-expanding European External Action Service, which is setting up offices in the US and other major countries.

It is seen by some UK diplomats as a direct threat to Britain’s standing  as a major world power.

Now Mr Hague is hitting back with plans to increase the number of British embassies by teaming up with the three Commonwealth allies.

Superpower: The Foreign secretary wants to create a worldwide network

In remote nations where Canada  but not Britain has an embassy,  or vice versa, they will share the embassy. Similar arrangements are expected to include Australia and New Zealand.

Mr Hague said: ‘As David Cameron said when addressing the Canadian parliament last year, “We are two nations, but under one Queen and united by one set of values.”

‘We have stood shoulder to shoulder from the great wars of the last century to fighting terrorists in Afghanistan and supporting Arab Spring nations like Libya and Syria.

‘We are first cousins.

So it is natural that we look to link up our embassies with Canada’s in places where that suits both countries. It will give us a bigger reach abroad for our businesses and people for less cost.’

One British diplomat put it more bluntly: ‘For all the grandiose talk of European unity, we have so much more in common with many Commonwealth countries than the EU – and not just the English language.

‘There is a saying in the British  diplomatic corps that “the French want to do us over, the Germans want to lord it over us and the Italians are all over the place”. 

‘We would never dream of trusting them with intelligence secrets, but we share everything with the Canadians, Aussies and Kiwis.

‘Brussels can extend its diplomatic reach – well, so can we.

The EU is so burdened by history it doesn’t know what it wants to do and is hopeless at speaking with one voice.

‘We Brits know who we are, who our real friends are, and between us we have been a rather good influence on the world in the past century.’
