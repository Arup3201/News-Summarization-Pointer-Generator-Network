An 11-year-old girl ran away from a man in a white commercial van who attempted to abduct her from a Melbourne street.

The man pulled up in the van, which had no windows, alongside the girl as she was walking along Francis St in Yarraville, an inner west Melbourne suburb, at about 3.25pm on Monday last week.

Police have obtained security camera footage of a suspect van in the area soon after the September 8 incident which was being driven erratically. 

Detective Senior Constable Brendan O'Mahoney said the driver repeatedly asked the girl to get in the van when she became scared and ran home to alert her parents.

'He's pulled up, stopped and opened the passenger door,' Detective Senior Constable Brendan O'Mahoney said.

'He asked a couple of times ... words to the effect of 'Get in the car, jump in, I'll give you a lift home'.

'When she ran he did a U-turn and, as she's looked over her shoulder, he was coming up behind her.'

The girl ran into a side street and the man drove off.

Police want to speak to anyone with in-car security cameras who may have filmed the van which had no side windows.

'We'd also like to speak to anyone who was in the area and may have been cut off by a van ... or who remembers anyone driving erratically,' Det Sen Const O'Mahoney said.

The driver is described as being of Indian appearance and aged about 30, with a distinctive scar on his inner right forearm.

He was wearing an orange turban and driving a white commercial van with no side windows.

Investigators have released a digital image of the man they would like to speak to who has the scarring they believe is on his arm.
