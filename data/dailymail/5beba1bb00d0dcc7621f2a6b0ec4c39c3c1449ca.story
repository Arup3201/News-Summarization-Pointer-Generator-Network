Bafetimbi Gomis illustrated his ability to respond to adversity by returning to the Swansea team soon after suffering a frightening fainting episode. 

He did similar at Villa Park, rousing himself after three missed chances to bury the winner in the closing stages.

Garry Monk, the Swansea manager, believes that goal, following a brilliant Jefferson Montero cross, showed his striker is ready to fill the void left by Wilfried Bony and replicate the kind of form he enjoyed at Lyon.

Every time Bafetimbi Gomis has scored this season, Swansea have won 

‘We know what the headlines would have been if we didn’t win that game,’ said Monk. ‘But Bafe didn’t let it affect him when he had those chances. He persevered and deserved that. His commitment and effort in recent weeks since Bony left has been top.’

His strike against Villa was his third Premier League goal of the season, even if all have been late winners. It was his 27th game in the English top-flight but only 14th start.

For Tim Sherwood, defeat punctured some of the building optimism around his tenure. The Villa manager insisted the club would not creep back into the ‘depression mode’ he encountered on arriving however.

‘The morale was very low when I came in. They were on the floor,’ he said. ‘I think that’s turned around now. I’m still confident even after this little blip that we’ll stay in the division.’
