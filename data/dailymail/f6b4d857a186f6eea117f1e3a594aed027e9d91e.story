A mother has told of the devastating moment she watched as her five-year-old son was crushed to death by the family car.

Harry Patterson was killed when the parked car began rolling backwards after the hand brake failed, and trapped him against the side of the family's house.

His mother Michelle, 38, had left the car in neutral when she had parked in her driveway but could only look on in horror as the silver Seat pinned her son to the wall after the brake discs slipped while they were cooling.

A coroner yesterday warned other drivers of the dangers of failing to leave their cars in gear on hills and slopes. 

An inquest heard Mrs Patterson had just brought Harry and brother Dylan, eight, home when the accident happened.

She said: 'I parked the car on the drive and put the handbrake on firmly. I was in the habit of shaking the car to make sure it was secure.

'Dylan and I got out of the car but Harry stayed inside. I told him, "Jump out Harry, I’m going to put the dinner on".

Michelle had decided to make faggots - a large type of meatball - especially for Harry. because he told her they were 'blinking beautiful'. But the inquest heard those were his final words.

His mother said: 'I went into the house and that’s when I heard Dylan shouting, "Mummy the car’s rolling down the drive".

'The first thing I thought was what damage is this going to cause; then I thought, "Where’s Harry?".'

Drama teacher Michelle rushed out to see the car trapped her son against the side of the house in the village of Alltwen, near Swansea, South Wales.

She said: 'He was on the driver's side of the car standing up with the car pushing him against the wall.

'I couldn’t pull him out, I tried to get in the car but I didn’t have keys. I ran and got them and went back the car.

'Harry had fallen to the floor, the car had gone back into my little boy.

'I lifted his head and I could feel it had been crushed inwards. There were horrific amounts of blood. Dylan was screaming, "My brother is dead".'

Harry was taken by helicopter to the University Hospital of Wales, Cardiff, where he was pronounced dead.

The family’s silver Seat Altea was taken away for examination by police accident investigators who found it had no defects.

But Philip Painting, of the South Wales Police collision investigating unit, said: 'A lot of people don’t realise that when a car is parked on a steep drive such as this one it needs to be left in gear.

'This is because when the vehicle is parked when the rear brakes are still hot as they cool down it can cause the disk brakes to slip.

'I don’t think the hand brake could be released by either of those boys.

'It is my opinion that as the brakes slipped it rolled down the hill and hit Harry.'

Recording a verdict of accidental death, Cardiff coroner Mary Hassel said: 'Harry was out playing around the car as little children do.

'It seems the car crept backwards as the discs were cooling. It was an appalling accident.

'Lots of people aren’t aware that this can happen and it is something which needs to be better publicised.'

Speaking after the inquest, Harry’s father Christian said: 'I was not aware of parking in first gear, and its a very high price to pay to find that out.

'We have set up a fund in Harry’s name and the first thing we will be doing is trying to make people aware so they will hopefully learn without having to suffer what we have.

'It was 13 weeks ago to the day that Harry died and we are just lost without him and that will always be the case.'
