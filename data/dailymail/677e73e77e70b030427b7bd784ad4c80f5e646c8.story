Mark Hill-Wood (pictured) was arrested on suspicion of fraud last week. He has used a string of different identities to dodge the authorities and escape bitter victims

A man accused of cheating the ex-wife of bankrupt tycoon Scot Young can be unmasked as a prolific fraudster and fantasist.

Mark Hill-Wood, 50, approached Michelle Young and offered to find her former husband’s missing millions.

She handed over thousands of pounds in the hope he would be able to break the deadlock after an acrimonious eight-year legal battle.

But MailOnline can reveal Hill-Wood is a ‘Walter Mitty’ career conman.

Our investigation has uncovered that the fraudster has hidden behind a string of different identities to dodge the authorities and escape bitter victims.

He has been convicted of elaborate scams including cheating elite athletes in the run up to the Olympics and conning Harrods out of a £200,000 watch.

The discovery is yet another twist to the incredible saga of the collapse of Mr Young’s empire and the bitter dispute over his lost wealth.

His death after falling onto railings outside his £3m Marylebone penthouse home has prompted fierce speculation about what happened to his fortune.

An inquest is expected to be opened this week but it could be several months before the full circumstances of his final hours are laid bare.

Meanwhile Mrs Young, who has two grown up daughters, has indicated she will continue to fight to find her ex-husband’s money and get her £20m divorce settlement.

She has employed a team of lawyers and private eyes in her search and was contacted by Hill-Wood in July.

He told her he had set up his own private detective agency known as FullProof Intelligence, which is based at a postal box in the City.

Mrs Young handed over more than £14,000 but refused a request for further funds when Hill-Wood did not hand over dossiers of her ex-husband he claimed to have retrieved.

She eventually reported him to the police and detectives from Surrey arrested him last Monday on suspicion of fraud offences.

It can now be revealed that Hill-Wood was previously known as Phillip Buffett and was labelled a ‘fantasy fraudster’ by a judge in April.

Then based in Croydon, South London, he was sentenced to a two year suspended jail sentence for duping Harrods out of a £200,000 watch.

The hearing gained national attention when the judge pilloried him for wearing a Ralph Lauren shirt in the dock and asked, ‘what's wrong with M&S?’

Reading Crown Court heard Buffett has 48 previous convictions and he was branded ‘completely unsuccessful in all that you do’.

The court was told he also cheated several companies and defrauding two men who applied to him for work under the umbrella of a company known as Uber Intelligence

One of the firms, a market leader in counter-explosive and IED products and training, was conned out of more than £27,000 pounds.

In another fraud the defendant got a luxury package to watch the Monaco Grand Prix, including hospitality on the Mercedes F1 yacht.

Photographs later emerged of him posing with former British Formula 1 racing driver David Coulthard during the racing.

In the past Buffet fleeced elite British athletes with the promise of lucrative sponsorship contracts in the build up to the London Olympics in 2012.

Hill-Wood, who has previously used the names Mark Cas and Mark Castley, was banned from running a company for seven years in 2011 after other frauds.

But he was able to get around the prohibition by simply changing his name by deed poll.

Approached at his home in Thames Ditton last night, Mr Hill-Wood declined to comment on his arrest.

Speaking through an intercom he said: ‘I think you have got your facts wrong’ but declined to elaborate or speak directly to a reporter.

Asked if Hill-Wood lived in the converted detached property, another resident replied: ‘Yes, unfortunately.’

Shown photographs of Buffet and Hill-Wood she confirmed they were her neighbour but declined to comment further.

A Surrey Police spokesman said: ‘Surrey Police is investigating an allegation of fraud at an address in Thames Ditton in October this year.

‘A man in his 50s was arrested on suspicion of fraud in connection with the offence on Monday December 15.

‘He was interviewed and has since been released on bail until June 2015 while the investigation continues.’
