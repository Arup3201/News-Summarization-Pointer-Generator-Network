A second man has this evening been charged with the horrific murder of a British solider on a London street.

Michael Adebolajo, 28, has been charged with the murder of Drummer Lee Rigby who was killed in front of horrified onlookers in Woolwich last month.

Scotland Yard said Adebolajo, of Romford, Essex, has also been charged with the attempted murder of two police officers and possession of a firearm.

He has been remanded in custody and will appear at Westminster 
Magistrates' Court on Monday.

Michael Adebowale, 22, has already been 
charged with murdering the young soldier and is due to appear at the Old
 Bailey on the same day.

Adebolajo was yesterday discharged from hospital were he had been receiving treatment after he was shot by armed police officers at the scene of the horrific murder.

Yesterday, the Metropolitan Police announced he had been discharged from hospital and taken into custody at a south London police station for questioning.

After arriving
 at the police station, Adebolajo was also arrested on the

It also emerged that police officers 
investigating the murder of Mr Rigby arrested two other men yesterday on

On Thursday, Michael Adebowale, 22, of Greenwich, appeared before magistrates also charged with Lee Rigby's murder.
