David Ospina is set to start only his second Arsenal game in the FA Cup against Hull, with Arsene Wenger claiming he has been a victim of 'post World Cup trauma'.

The Colombia goalkeeper, who will come in for Wojciech Szczesny, has struggled with injuries since moving to London from Nice last summer.

'David had a difficult start to the season,' said Wenger. 'When I speak about post-World Cup trauma, he is a big example, because he got injured during the World Cup and came back injured.

'Because he came to a new club, he wanted to get back fit as quickly as possible and got injured again.'

Ospina spent six years in France and Wenger added: 'I believe he is a great goalkeeper with a good understanding of the game and fantastic reflexes.

'He displayed that when he came on against Galatasaray at home in October. He made some fantastic saves and I think he has a great future.'

His first start for Arsenal came in the Capital One Cup defeat against Southampton, in September. He appeared as a substitute for the final half-hour of a 4-1 win in the Champions League against Galatasaray, after Szczesny had been sent off.
