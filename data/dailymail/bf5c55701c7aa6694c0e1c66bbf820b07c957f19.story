Chelsea striker Diego Costa has been in sensational form since arriving at Stamford Bridge from Atletico Madrid.

Seven goals in four games, the best start by any player to life in the Premier League, have seen him establish himself as Jose Mourinho's star performer.

But, with respect to the likes of Burnley, Leicester and Swansea, he had not, until Sunday, come up against a defender of the quality of Vincent Kompany.

Vincent Kompany and Diego Costa go shoulder to shoulder as the league's top scorer faced a tough test

In the first half Diego Costa spent more time in his own penalty area than anywhere else on the pitch

It was always going to be intriguing to see how the Spaniard coped when up against a truly world class defender, and, in the first half at least, the answer was plain. 

Isolated up front on his own Costa saw very little of the ball and didn't manage a single shot in the first 45 minutes.

Only once did he escape his Belgian opponent, on the stroke of half time, but the slightest touch from Fernandinho prevented Costa from scoring after Branislav Ivanovic's knock-down from a corner.

When the ball finally did come to Costa in the City area he was both offside and fired wide

Up until Zabaleta's red card the Chelsea striker had been unable to have any significant impact on the game

In fact, in the first half, the Spanish striker spent more time in his own penalty area than Manchester City's.

Much of this was down to Jose Mourinho's tactical set-up. Cesc Fabregas, the supplier-in-chief thus far for Costa's goals, was rarely close enough to him to provide. 

When Fabregas did get forward and try and feed Costa, Kompany was there, to intercept, to tackle, to stifle.

Willian and Ramires offered energy in midfield, but scarcely made it into the City half, as Mourinho's plan to soak up pressure blunted not only City, but also his own attack.

Eventually, early in the second half, it looked like Costa may get a chance. When the ball found him in the City penalty area, however, he was both offside and unable to find the target.

Diego Costa tangles with Pablo Zabaleta as the striker continues to be a nuisance despite little service

The frustration was clearly boiling over, but Costa still had the nuisance factor which resulted in Pablo Zabaleta's red card. 

Before that moment, Costa had been involved in 10 duels with City players and lost all of them. 

But, with the increased space, and the onus on Chelsea to come forward, the striker was finally in the game. 

Costa played a key part in Andre Schurrle's goal and the Spanish striker was quick to celebrate

Costa may have had a quiet game, but he played a crucial part in Andre Schurrle's goal 

By the time he was substituted Costa's influence had grown but he was still outclassed by Vincent Kompany

It was Costa who drove at the City defence before feeding Eden Hazard who crossed for Andre Schurrle's pivotal goal.

And, as the game wore on, he even managed an effort on target (only Chelsea's second of the game), a header straight into the hands of Joe Hart, before striking the post with by far his best effort of the game. 

It was fitting that City were back level by the time Costa was eventually removed. Denied the service he thrives on, he never offered enough against Vincent Kompany to earn the win.
