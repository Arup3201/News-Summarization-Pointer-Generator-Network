Vital weapons shipments from the United States have begun to arrive in rebel fighting units that oppose the regime of dictator Bashar al-Assad in Syria, according to sources on both ends of the transactions.

The light arms, ammunition and other small, trackable armaments – likely grenades, mortars and shells – are coming via clandestine CIA operations in a significant escalation of U.S. involvement in the 30-month-long civil war.

The White House promised in June that it would arm anti-Assad forces who were not aligned with Islamist radical groups, authorizing the CIA to do the heavy lifting and manage the pipeline.

But news of the weapons' long-awaited delivery comes at an awkward moment, a day after President Obama pledged to pursue diplomacy instead of military action.

The Washington Post reported late Wednesday night that the CIA has expanded its clandestine network of bases in bordering Turkey and Jordan over the past year, initially to help allies like Saudi Arabia and Qatar to send weapons across the Syrian border.

Now those installations are the conduit for American military hardware destined for moderate rebel factions organized under the banner of the Supreme Military Council.

That fighting force, outnumbered and outgunned, is led by Gen. Salim Idris, a former Syrian Army commander who defected in 2012.

Opposition fighters have sustained heavy losses while they waited for the U.S. to send the cavalry, in often gruesome battles that have killed more than 100,000 and turned 2 million civilians into refugees.

Last week a career U.S. intelligence official told MailOnline that the delay was in part due to a turf battle between the intelligence and diplomatic communities in Washington.

Speaking on condition of anonymity, the source said that while higher-ups in the State Department understood that CIA officials would be in charge of shipping arms to border stations and transporting them into Syria, they wanted a say in the delivery timetable.

'It was disheartening,' the source said, 'to see the anti-Assad guys gasping for breath while the brains at Foggy Bottom [where the State Dept. is headquartered] talked about choosing the right moment to turn the tide.'

The State Department replied that it 'cannot detail every single type of support that we are providing to the opposition or discuss timelines for delivery.'

'[B]ut it’s important to note that both the political and the military opposition are and will be receiving this assistance.'

News that U.S. weapons are making it to rebel fighting groups will provide the latest in a whiplash-inducing series of developments in Washington since a chemical weapons attack killed more than 1,400 Syrians on August 21.

Less than two weeks ago, Obama asked a vacationing Congress to approve a resolution authorizing him to launch military strikes in retaliation. After a week's reflection, the Republican-controlled House watched warily as the Democratic-controlled Senate rushed through committee hearings and was poised for a floor vote.

Then in what a White House official later conceded was a 'major goof,' Secretary of State John Kerry answered a reporter's question during a press conference Monday in London by quipping that if Assad wanted to avoid a U.S. attack, he could 'turn over every single bit 
of his chemical weapons to the international community in the next week.'

'He isn't about to do it,' Kerry quickly added, 'and it can't be done, obviously.'

But Russia, a key Assad ally with a strategically irreplaceable naval base on Syria's Mediterranean coast and a continuing series of its own arms deals in play, leaped into the diplomatic opening.

In the space of hours, the Russian and Syrian foreign 
ministers said publicly that Kerry's 'proposal' was to their liking.

The result was an historic backpedal by the White House on the day the president was expected to argue in favor of military force in a series of six television network interviews, and a day before a scheduled prime-time public address.

Now Russian President Vladimir Putin has emerged with a diplomatic coup, promising to help Assad surrender his suddenly declared chemical weapons stockpiles on what the White House conceded Wednesday is an unspecified timetable.

Obama was left Tuesday night to tell the American people that he had asked Congress to put his war-powers resolution on the back burner while international negotiations play out.

What Obama surely knew when he first asked Congress to approve military intervention – although the public wasn't informed – was that U.S. military hardware was already crossing the Syrian border.

It's unclear whether, at the time, the White House told key members of Congress what the CIA was doing.

Tennessee Sen. Bob Corker, the ranking Republican on the Senate Foreign Affairs Committee, crafted the war powers resolution with his Democratic counterpart, New Jersey Sen. Bob Menendez, the committee's chairman. Yet three weeks ago Corker was embarrassed when Syrians on the Turkish border begged him for the speedy dispatch of American weapons.

'It was humiliating,' he told the Post. 'The president had announced that we would be providing lethal aid, and not a drop of it had begun. They were very short on ammunition, and the weapons had not begun to flow.'

'There's been a major disconnect,' Corker said on Sept. 2, between what the administration has said it's doing relative to the rebels and what is actually happening. The pipeline has been incredibly slow. It's really hurt morale among the Syrian rebels.'

On Wednesday morning at a Wall Street Journal breakfast in Washington, Arizona Republican Sen. John McCain hinted after Obama's prime-time address that he believed the moderate Syrian opposition was still playing a waiting game with the U.S.

'I guarantee I'm going to hear from Gen. Idris today,' McCain said, 'and he's going to say, "Have you abandoned us? Have you abandoned us? Aren't you going to help us?"'

'And my answer is going to have to be, "General, I will do everything I can to try and get support for you."'

Word of warning: Russia's president, Vladimir Putin, says a U.S. strike will bring more violence

Other nations have been supplying and resupplying the anti-Assad rebels while the U.S. dithered, most significantly the Saudi and Qatari shipments that the CIA was facilitating through its stations in Turkey and Jordan.

But the Obama administration will continue to face tough questions about why its June 2013 promises took three months to fulfill.

A month after that pledge, Kerry met at the United Nations headquarters with Ahmad Al-Jarba, a former Syrian political prisoner who now leads the National Coalition for Syrian Revolutionary and Opposition Forces, the largest Western-backed opposition group.

Jarba said in a statement on July 26 that his people's situation was 'desperate' without sufficient weapons to hold its positions in Damascus suburbs, and in the more distant provinces of Homs, Aleppo and Deir al-Zor.

Opposition forces, he said then, needed swift U.S. action 'to push the international community to demand a political transition.'

In the late spring, the Obama administration's daily drumbeat on Syria included assertions that U.S. involvement was aimed at forcing Assad from power.

'We have been making clear as a matter of United States policy that we believe that Assad must not continue to rule Syria,' White House Press Secretary Jay Carney said during a briefing on May 29.

'We are unapologetic,' he added, 'about a policy position that calls for a future in Syria that does not include a tyrant who has demonstrated his willingness to murder his own people.'

But in the week following the Aug. 21 chemical weapons attack, Carney began to provide fuel to skeptics who feared American promises of concrete help for rebel groups would go unfulfilled. 

'I want to make clear,' he told reporters on Aug. 28, 'that the options that we are considering are not about regime change.  They are about responding to a clear violation of an international standard that prohibits the use of chemical weapons.'
