Cleared: Anarchist Malcolm Blackman, was accused of rape in a tent outside St Paul's

A PROMINENT anti-capitalist  activist last night claimed his career  is ‘in ruins’ after he was cleared of  raping a woman at a protest camp outside St Paul’s Cathedral.

Malcolm Blackman, 46, was found not guilty of two counts of rape at the Old  Bailey yesterday, following a high-profile eight-day case.

He was alleged to have raped a fellow  protester – with whom he was in a ‘casual’ sexual relationship – inside her tent as they took part in the Occupy London protest in January last year.

On one occasion, the jury had been told, he attacked her when she had passed out drunk. He was accused on another occasion of tying a belt around her neck and ‘throttling’ her while he forced her to perform a sex act.

The self-styled leader of the Anonymous UK group visibly shook and closed his eyes as the jury returned a not guilty verdict after 11 hours and 14 minutes.

Afterwards Mr Blackman, a street entertainer, claimed he was a ‘victim’ of the legal system and called for anonymity for those accused of sexual assault.

Speaking outside court, he said: ‘Everybody’s a victim. Twelve months my life’s been on hold, I’ve not eaten, I’ve not slept.

‘I’ve been vilified – my career is in ruins. I’m a street performer – a magician. But there’ll always be doubts – there’ll always be those who say, “Oh, he got away with it”.’

Criticising the Crown Prosecution Service for bringing the case to court, he said: ‘I feel it was never in the public interest.

‘There was never any evidence of a crime. To have to stand in the dock as long as I have with my life in limbo has had a serious effect on my health.

‘I now wish to slide back into anonymity from where I came.’

The former court security guard said he would dedicate his time to campaigning for anonymity for rape defendants. He said: ‘I feel very strongly that the law needs to be reviewed with regard to anonymity to both parties with cases like this.’

The woman who claimed she had been 
raped was not in court to hear the verdict, but afterwards, the City of 
London Police expressed their disappointment.

Detective Sergeant Marcos Gilson, the 
officer who led the investigation, said: ‘Today’s outcome is obviously a
 disappointing one for both myself and the victim.

‘The bravery and tenacity of the 
victim has been key to bringing this matter to trial and I can only 
commend her on doing it with such strength and integrity under what 
were, and have been, very difficult circumstances.

‘Her willingness to cooperate fully 
with the police should be heartening to those in a similar situation and
 I hope this will encourage others to come forward, regardless of the 
decision of the jury today.’

Mr Blackman, of Weston-super-Mare, Somerset, was accused of raping the woman on January 21 and 28 last year.

Jurors heard that he was alleged to have used rape to ‘punish her’ when she became too clingy and a ‘nuisance’.

The woman said she did not go to the police until June because she felt ‘ashamed and embarrassed’.

But Mr Blackman insisted the 
allegations were a ‘complete fabrication’ and that she had invented the 
attacks to get back at him after discovering he had slept with another 
activist on January 25.

The court heard that Mr Blackman had 
three sexual relationships during the four-month protest camp outside St
 Paul’s, between October 2011 and February 2012.

He kept a tally of his sexual 
‘conquests’ on the outside of his tent, something he dismissed as ‘a 
lads’ joke’ and an attempt to ‘boost morale’ in the camp.

The Occupy London protest, which campaigned against corporate greed, was finally removed by bailiffs in February.

His barrister, Gordon Ross, told the 
court during the trial: ‘He may be, in old-fashioned terminology, a cad,
 a bounder, a womaniser.

‘He may be a four-letter word starting in ‘S’ and ending in ‘T’, but that doesn’t make him a rapist.’
