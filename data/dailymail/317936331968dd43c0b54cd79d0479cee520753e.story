Barcelona will face Atletico Madrid in the quarter finals of the Copa del Rey after a convincing win against La Liga strugglers Elche. The game was over after Barca's 5-0 win in the first leg but Luis Enrique's side maintained their professionalism to complete the job.

Adriano heads in Barcelona's fourth to complete the scoring with just seconds to go. 

Ter Stegen is called into action as he palms out the first shot before making sure he holds on to the second effort at goal. We are into the final minute.

Elche are trying their best to score a goal but they have been unable to really test Ter Stegen.

Sportsmail's Rik Sharma: 'Alen Halilovic is the SEVENTH youth player that Luis Enrique has given his debut to since he has been at the club. Whatever you think of the coach, he's certainly buying in to the La Masia philosophy. He might as well as he won't be buying anything else because of the transfer ban.'

Halilovic produces a terrific piece of skill before curling the ball towards goal. However the woodwork comes to Elche's rescue as his shot cannons off the post. He looks a real talent. 20 minutes left to play.

Barcelona's youngsters are playing in a similar mould to the first team. Neat, intricate passing in the final third. No wonder Enrique is all smiles.

Highly-rated teenager Alen Halilovic has been brought on to make his debut for Barcelona's first team. The Catalan giants beat off competition from their European rivals to sign the 18-year-old in the summer.

It feels like a low-profile friendly match now. An easy night for Barcelona's players. Elche have rarely threatened despite trying their best to give their fans something to celebrate. 

Sportsmail's Rik Sharma: 'Some interesting goalkeeping from Ter Stegen there. Perhaps he's been watching too much of his countryman, Manuel Neuer. Then again, maybe he thinks he can handle an outfield jaunt tonight because Elche haven't been at the races so far. Chelsea youngster Pasalic, meanwhile, has made three not-inconsiderable fouls, but has thus far avoided a booking. Jose Mourinho will be taking note.'

Goalscorer Roberto will be hoping he can impress enough to earn himself a start in La Liga. However it must be hard for the 22-year-old when you are competing with Neymar and Messi.

Barcelona starlet Adama should have added a fourth however his cross-cum-shot goes just wide of Manu Herrera's goal.

The moment of the first half was definitely Mathieu's free-kick. Messi would have been proud of that strike!

Enrique's side are 3-0 up on the night without even stepping into second gear. Elche's players will be dreading the second half.

Munir is fouled inside the area - leaving Pedro to net from the spot. It's just too easy for Barcelona's 'weakened' side.

Sergi Roberto doubles his side's lead with a left-footed drive from the edge of the box. It is now 7-0 to Barcelona on aggregate. Pique must have woken up after that strike!

Substitute Gerard Pique looks extremely bored on the subs' bench. He probably wanted the night off alongside the likes of Messi and Neymar.

Pedro ran to celebrate with Mathieu after the opener. Barcelona's stand-in captain is being given the time and space to dictate play but has not been able to unlock Elche's defence thus far.

Sportsmail Rik Sharma: 'Only around 8,000 here tonight, but who can blame Elche's fans? It's been a miserable season and with Barcelona 5-0 up from the first leg, there's not even the draw of seeing any of the major Blaugrana stars. Oh, and the game kicked off at 10pm local time - on a school night.' 

Mathieu's last goal came at the back end of last season for Valencia. He was congratulated by his team-mates after his opener.

Sportsmail's Rik Sharma: 'Jeremy Mathieu has been a good signing this season but people frequently comment that he can look a bit cumbersome, a bit clumsy. There was nothing cumbersome about that free kick though. Lionel Messi has some competition for those set-plays...'

Mathieu's goal was his first competitive goal for Barcelona. I wonder if Messi will let the Frenchman take free-kicks in future matches...

Albacar gets a yellow card for a deliberate foul. Barcelona open the scoring with a tremendous free-kick through Matheiu.

18 minutes gone and Barcelona's defenders seem to be content with passing the ball around. Elche look lively but have not threatened Ter Stegen's goal.

Pedro is captaining Barcelona in the absence of Messi, Xavi and Iniesta. Adrian has just missed a great chance from close range. Nine minutes gone here.

Attention has turned to Barcelona who are hoping to book a date with Atletico Madrid. Messi, Suarez and Neymar have all been given a night off due to Barca's 5-0 lead. 

The holders are out!

Real Madrid and Atletico Madrid have drawn 2-2 in their second leg meaning Atletico go through 4-2 on aggregate. 

Fernando Torres was on target twice for Atletico.

'In stark contrast to the scenes we saw outside of the Santiago Bernabeu, with the streets full of supporters, there's little atmosphere for this game. It's largely because Barcelona ended it in the first leg, with a brutal and relentless barrage of attacks that saw off Elche. That said, there was still a fair crowd to greet Barcelona's team bus tonight.

'What tonight's about, for Luis Enrique, is giving the youngsters a chance to shine and making sure the team arrives in high spirits for the trip to the Riazor, to face Deportivo la Coruna on Sunday.'

The teams are in...

Barcelona have made a number of changes 

Barcelona: Ter Stegen, Montoya, Bartra, Mathieu, Adriano, Gumbau, Sergi Roberto, Rafinha, Pedro, Munir, Adama

Subs: Masip, Pique, Rakitic, Douglas, Halilovic, Ie, Diagne

Elche: Manu Herrera, Peral, Lomban, Pelegrin, Edu Albaca, Galvez, Pasalic, Coro, Alvaro, Fragapane, Cristian Herrera

Subs: Pol Freixanet, Enzo Roco, Domingo Cisma, Aaron, Adrian, Faycal Fajr, Moha

Hello and welcome to the Copa del Rey clash between Elche and Barcelona.

Barcelona won the first leg 5-0 at the Nou Camp last week, so there is little doubt about who will progress to the next round. 

Luis Enrique changed his Barcelona line-up for the 28th time in a row, dropping Lionel Messi, Neymar and Luis Suarez, but this time nobody was complaining as they racked up a big victory to ease through to the Copa del Rey quarter-finals.

The Asturian coach put out an entirely different side to the team that saw off Atletico Madrid last weekend and the reserves responded impressively, to offer Diego Simeone's side the chance of revenge in the next round. 

Two brilliant first half goals from Jeremy Mathieu and Sergi Roberto set Barcelona on their way, before Pedro and Adriano added two more, and their team did the footballing equivalent of putting their feet up and having a doze in front of the fire, gently stirred by the odd Elche effort whizzing over the crossbar.
