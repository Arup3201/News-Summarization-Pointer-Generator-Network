On the run: Steven Dunne was allowed out for the day, despite a judge ruling he should be detained indefinitely for killing his neighbour

A killer who stabbed his neighbour to death because he thought he was a witch has gone on the run.

Paranoid schizophrenic Steven Dunne failed to return to a low secure unit in Hellingly, East Sussex, on Wednesday evening.

The 42-year-old stabbed Gordon Stalker, 51, seven times in a frenzied attack on the doorstep of their shared house in Brighton in February last year, believing he was trying to steal his soul.

Although a judge ordered him to be locked up indefinitely under Mental Health Act last November, doctors said he posed a low risk to the public and allowed him to take unescorted leave from Southview Low Secure Unit.

But police did not warn the public Dunne had failed to return from leave at 5pm on Wednesday until almost 24 hours had passed.

In the days leading up to his death Mr Stalker repeatedly told family and friends he was terrified of his neighbour, who had threatened to 'burn him' because he thought he was stealing his soul by taking photos of him on trips out together.

The electrician reported Dunne to police twice in June 2009, but he was not thought to be dangerous enough to be locked away.

Eight months later he knocked on Mr Stalker's door and stabbed him seven times with a 20cm kitchen knife when he answered.

Last year, his victim's father Ian 
Stalker, 75, from Carlisle, Cumbria, criticised police and social 
services for failing to take the threat Dunne posed seriously.

After Dunne was sentenced, Mr Stalker said: 'It was clear to anyone with eyes to see that this man was a real danger.

'He was seriously disturbed, and needed treatment. My son did everything he could to alert the authorities, but they didn't protect him.

'They were negligent.  As a result I have lost my flesh and blood.'

However, police and doctors insist Dunne is no longer a threat to the public.

A spokeswoman from the Sussex Partnership NHS Foundation Trust said: 'Mr Dunne has been assessed by his clinical team and poses a low risk to himself and to the public, however, it is important he takes regular medication and will need to return to hospital as soon as possible.'

Sussex Police said officers have contacted Mr Stalker's family about the incident.

Detective Inspector Rob Morland said: 'We are concerned for Steven's welfare and would urge him to get in touch. 

'We believe Steven to be in the Brighton area and neighbourhood officers are working with partnership agencies to locate Steven.

'If you see Steven, please contact police immediately.'

Dunne is described as white northern European, 5'4, short brown hair, blue eyes, stocky, wearing a red t-shirt, black trousers and blue trainers.
