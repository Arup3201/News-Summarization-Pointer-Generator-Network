Four days after an earthquake changed their lives forever, a mother and daughter - whose rescue became a beacon of hope for thousands of earthquake-affected people - have been reunited.

Semiha Karaduman could not contain her joy as a nurse handed her 16-day-old Azra, who made international headlines after being pulled naked from the rubble in Ercis 48 hours after a 7.2-magnitude quake devastated southeastern Turkey.

Both were transported to an Ankara hospital, where they recovering from the affects of dehydration. 

Reunited: Earthquake survivor Semiha Karaduman is given her 16-day-old baby girl Azra at a hospital in Ankara. Azra became international news on Tuesday after being removed alive from a collapsed building

Dramatic rescue: A female doctor carries baby Azra Karaduman from a collapsed building in Ercis. Mother Semiha had to wait before she too was freed

Finally freed: Semiha and then her mother were freed from the building and taken to hospital

It comes as a teenager was pulled alive from the wreckage after 100 hours of being trapped underneath rubble.

Eighteen-year-old Imdat was found by rescuers searching for survivors.

He was lifted onto a stretcher by medical workers who carried him through cheering crowds crying 'Allahu Akbar!' to a waiting ambulance, which took him away to hospital.

Imdat Padak was placed on a stretcher and whisked off to hospital as crowds gathered to watch his remarkable rescue

Sheltering thousands of homeless families became Turkey's priority today, as chances dwindled of finding more survivors four days after an earthquake struck the mainly Kurdish southeast province of Van.

The death toll has risen to 534, with at least 1,650 injured and 185 rescued from the rubble after Sunday's 7.2 
magnitude quake, the country's biggest in more than a decade. More than 
600,000 have been affected by the quake.

In
Ercis, the town hardest hit, rain and snow overnight dashed any hopes 
of finding more survivors in the shattered buildings, and many of the 
homeless complained about having to queue for tents.

Hopes fading: Heavy rain and snow have hampered rescue operations in Ercis, and many crews have given up searching for survivors in the rubble

Freezing conditions: Powerful lighting shows the cold night air as rescuers attempt to pull more survivors from the rubble. The emphasis now is finding shelter for the thousands of homeless

Fetih Zengin, 38, an estate agent 
whose house was  badly damaged in the quake, said: 'Everyone is getting 
sick and wet. We have been waiting in line for four days like this and 
still nothing. It gets to our turn and they say they have run out.

'We
slept under a piece of plastic erected on some wood boards we found. We
have 10 children in our family, they are getting sick. Everyone needs a
tent, snow is coming. It's a disaster.

Searches for survivors continued at some sites but at others rescuers had given up hope.

Exhausted relatives clung to hopes that loved ones would still be found, keeping vigil at the sites of their destroyed homes.

Keeping vigil: A woman sits near a collapsed building in Ercis. Many are staying in the hope loved ones may emerge alive. In many other cases, people have nowhere else to go

However, while media coverage has centered on 
tales of against-the-odds rescues - including a two-week-old baby girl who 
was pulled alive from the rubble - most stories of the trapped have ended
with death and unfathomable pain for those 
left behind.

Murat Sonmez 
knows only too well the horror of Ercis: his mother, wife and four 
daughters were crushed to death in their home on Sunday.

He named them as his 32-year-old wife 
Meral, four daughters Nisa Nur, two, Meryem, 
seven, 12-year-old Asli and 15-year-old Meral, and his 65-year-old mother, 
Hatice.

Indescribable pain: Murat Sonmez lost his mother, wife and his four children in the quake. Turkish Prime Minister Recep Tayyip Erdogan blamed poorly constructed buildings for the large-scale loss of life

Lapsing into long silences at times, 
he said: 'I was not at home. God gave them, God took them away. I can't 
find anything to say. I can't describe my pain.'

He
stood by a ruined four-storey apartment building - he lived with his 
family on the second floor. The third and fourth floors were occupied by
his brother and father, who both managed to escape.

For thousands of others, the quake has left them without food, clothes or shelter.

Overnight, groups of shell-shocked 
people roamed aimlessly, with no home to go to, huddling around fires as
temperatures dropped to freezing. Others congregated in relief camps.

Huddled together: Multiple families are forced to make a home together in the Red Crescent-provided tents. Many more, however, are left outside as the wether gets colder and colder

Although
some families were staying out in the open few were ready to leave 
their land, preferring to bank on promises of temporary housing within 
about six weeks.   

Zeki Yatkin, 46, said: 'They say we will get prefabricated houses in one-and-a-half months. We can't tolerate the cold, but what else could we do?'

Orhan Ogunc, 37, was less optimistic, saying: 'After 15 days, half of the people here 
will die, freeze to death.'

Turkey's prime minister has said shoddy construction contributed to the high casualty toll in Turkey's earthquake.

Queue for shelter: People affected by the earthquake queue up for tents to be distributed near a military base in Ercis. Many have complained about the shortage of shelter for the homeless

Help is on the way: Airport employees help load a prefabricated home onto a plane at Ben Gurion International airport near Tel Aviv before it departs for Turkey

Recep
Tayyip Erdogan said Turkey had not learned enough from past earthquakes
that toppled poorly constructed buildings, trapping people inside.

He said 'concrete virtually turned to sand' during the quake, and he compared the actions of irresponsible builders to murder.

The disaster could be a chance for Mr Erdogan's government to show the Kurds how much it cares for their people.   

Having won a third consecutive term in a national election last June, Mr Erdogan aims to replace the constitution with one that will boost democratic values by, among other things, addressing some of the Kurdish minority's grievances.    

More than 40,000 people have been killed in a separatist insurgency that has lasted three decades, and last week militants killed 24 troops in neighbouring Hakkari province.

The United States and the European Union, as well as Turkey, consider the PKK separatist guerrilla group to be a terrorist organisation.   

Some quake victims have blamed Mr Erdogan's AK party for a slow response and accused officials of handing aid to supporters.

At one warehouse in Van, about 100 people looted Red Crescent trucks carrying food, blankets, carpets and clothes, while a handful of police appeared powerless to stop them.    

The British Government will provide emergency tents to house more than 5,500 people whose homes were destroyed by the Turkish earthquake, Home Secretary Theresa May announced today during a visit to the country.

Following meetings with Turkish government ministers, the Home Secretary (pictured right)  announced that Britain would send 1,144 protective winter tents from the UK's warehouse in Dubai.

The tents will be flown out to Turkey by the Department for International Development (DFID), which will co-ordinate the British efforts.

In addition, a team of British experts are planning to visit the disaster area to check on humanitarian needs and ensure the best use of the tents.

Mrs May said: 'The United Kingdom stands ready to help those affected by the recent earthquake.

'We are dispatching a plane-load of more than 1,000 tents for 5,500 people who are without shelter following a request from the Turkish government. A team of technical staff will accompany the tents to help with their deployment.

'We are also sending a humanitarian expert to assess what additional aid is needed following this devastating disaster.'

International Development Minister Andrew Mitchell said: 'Britain's aid will help provide shelter for the thousands of families who are currently forced to sleep in freezing conditions after their homes were destroyed.'

Turkish authorities estimated that around 20,000 homes have been destroyed and up to 600,000 people are sleeping out in freezing conditions, scared to return to their homes.

The tents will arrive at the disaster zone in the coming days. Each tent can accommodate a family of five.
