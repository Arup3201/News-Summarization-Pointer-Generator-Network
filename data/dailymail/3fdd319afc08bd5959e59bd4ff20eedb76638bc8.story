President Barack Obama and first lady Michelle Obama observed their 22nd wedding anniversary a day late with a celebratory dinner Saturday night in the city's Georgetown neighborhood.

For their anniversary dinner they picked Bourbon Steak at the Four Seasons Hotel, about a six-minute drive from the White House.

Shortly after Obama arrived at the restaurant, more than 100 protesters calling for justice for Michael Brown, the shooting victim in Ferguson, Missouri, marched down M Street in what appeared to be a previously planned demonstration.
