It boasts a futuristic silver exterior, a luxury 'lounge area' and most incredibly - no driver. 

This Mercedes-Benz self-driving car has been spotted cruising around the streets of San Francisco.

The F015 Luxury In Motion, first unveiled at a consumer show in January, was caught on camera by stunned bystanders as it traveled through the California city for a photo shoot last Wednesday.

Some later took to social media to share their experiences of the autonomous research vehicle, deeming it 'futuristic', 'really cool' and 'radical'. Many questioned its presence on the streets.

Sleek: Mercedes-Benz's F015 Luxury In Motion, first unveiled at a consumer show in January, was caught on camera by stunned bystanders as it cruised around San Francisco (above) for a photo shoot last Wednesday

A striking sight: Some passersby later took to social media to share their experiences of the autonomous research vehicle (pictured traveling through San Francisco), deeming it 'futuristic', 'really cool' and 'radical'

Photo shoot: Last Thursday, Mercedes-Benz said the car (pictured in front of the Golden Gate Bridge) was driving around the California city 'for running footage and photography for future communication purposes'

Impressed: One Twitter user, named Aaron Hoff, posted a photo of the city's residents looking in awe at the car on the social network. He wrote: 'This driverless Mercedes cruising around SF blowing everyone's mind'

One Reddit user, named 'sfchillin' posted a photo of the sleek F015 in downtown San Francisco on the site, asking fellow users to help identify it. 'Anyone know anything about this car?' they asked.

Responses to the post included: 'Parked in the crosswalk like a boss. Self driving car does what it wants', 'It's from the future!' and 'Must be filming a promo or something', SF Gate reported. 

Professional photographer Jake Stangel later uploaded a picture of the car to Instagram, writing that it was apparently trailed to the location for a shoot, but was now powering along a road by itself.

The F015 debuted at the 2015 International Consumer Electronic Show in Las Vegas. On its website, Mercedes-Benz says the car offers  'an innovative perspective into the future of mobility'.

The vehicle, which is not yet available commercially, features a futuristic design that centers around 'sensuousness and clarity'. It has a low-slung front end, a flat front windscreen and a smooth roof.

It also boasts an impressive 'lounge' area with walnut wood flooring, touch screens and white leather seats, which can rotate. This enables the 'driver' to turn around to chat more freely with passengers.

LED lights: It is unclear whether the F015 was being operated by a human driver or not when it was spotted cruising around San Francisco. Footage of the car was later circulated on Instagram (pictured) and Twitter

Impressive technology: To 'communicate with its surroundings both visually and acoustically', the car features large LED displays at its front and rear. It also has a laser projection system and complex acoustic features

To 'communicate with its surroundings both visually and acoustically', the car features large LED displays at its front and rear. It also has a laser projection system and complex acoustic features.

When the vehicle is self-driving, it can project lights on to the road using its LED headlights to let pedestrians know when to cross. The car can also switch to manual mode to give the driver a rest.

Cruising: The car, which seats four, measures 17ft (5.2 m) in length and 5ft (1.5 m) high. It is made of carbon-fibre, aluminium and high-strength steel. It is designed to use an electric motor and a hydrogen fuel cell

Last Thursday, Mercedes-Benz said the car was driving around the city 'for running footage and photography for future communication purposes,' adding that development is still 'underway'. 

If the F015 eventually goes into production, its particular specifications could change. It is part of Mercedes' vision for urban autonomous driving, which would include 'safe zones' for self-driving cars.

Last year, the company reportedly became one of the first US automotive manufacturers to be granted a license for testing self-driving concept cars on public roads by the state of California.

The F015, which seats four, measures 17ft (5.2 m) in length and 5ft (1.5 m) high. It is made of carbon-fibre, aluminium and high-strength steel. It is designed to use an electric motor and a hydrogen fuel cell. Using its hybrid system, it can travel 685 miles (1,100km) on a single charge.

It is unknown how much the car would be priced at if it became available commercially.
