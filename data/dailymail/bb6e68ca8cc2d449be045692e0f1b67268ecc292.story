Under-fire Sepp Blatter has provoked yet more ridicule after dancing on stage at a FIFA event on Monday night.

The 78-year-old was more David Brent than John Travolta as he, rather embarrassingly, shook his hips alongside Brazilian sultress Fernanda Lima.

But the model is unlikely to be have been overwhelmed by Blatter's moves which is sure to have left her and the audience cringing.

Blatter sparked fresh controversy on Monday when he claimed allegations of corruption around the Qatar victory to host the 2022 World Cup was being driven by the ‘racism and discrimination’ of the ‘British media’.

Football Association chairman Greg Dyke said he found the remarks ‘completely unacceptable’ and stood up to the FIFA president in an auditorium at the city’s Renaissance Hotel.

‘The only reason I did it was because of what Mr Blatter said yesterday, which I found, as I’m sure many of you found, offensive,’ he said.

Dyke shared his response to Blatter with the media. ‘I said: “Could I say that I regard the comments you made yesterday about the allegations in the British media in which you described them as racist as totally unacceptable. I have read the articles in the Sunday Times in great detail, and the allegations being made have nothing to do with racism. They are allegations about corruption within FIFA.

‘These allegations need to be properly investigated and properly answered. We need to know from Mr Garcia (Michael Garcia, the independent FIFA investigator) tomorrow if he was aware of the material in the Sunday Times before it was published and, if not, whether he will now extend his investigation to consider these allegations.

Mr Blatter, many of us are deeply troubled by your reaction to these allegations. It’s time for FIFA to stop attacking the messenger and instead consider and understand the message.’

Dyke said Blatter did not react as he stood at a lectern on the stage. ‘He said it would be addressed tomorrow in FIFA Congress,’ said Dyke.

David Gill, the former Manchester United chief executive and current member of the UEFA executive committee, echoed Dyke in a press conference after the European governing body’s meeting had finished.

When Dyke was asked if Blatter should now stand for re-election next year, he replied: ‘Dave Gill has real concerns.‘Obviously there would have to be a decision made by the FA board but I think that we all accept that four years ago he (Blatter) said he was only standing for one more term.

‘We were asked at a meeting fairly recently and our view was that among the British public there wasn’t any doubt that brand FIFA is severely damaged. And I suspect that’s the same throughout large parts of Europe.

‘I suspect there is a view within the FA that we would support that position (that Blatter should stand down) but we will decide that at the board, which is the proper place.’
