Critics have accused Prince Charles of being 'elitist' after he drew up a guide for city planners which attempts to banish unsightly concrete, phone wires, tower blocks and cars.

The prince wrote his ten-point plan as part of a 'big rethink' on how to design cities for a world population expected to hit almost 10billion by 2050.

Despite denying he wanted to return Britain to a 'Golden Age', his list prompted mixed responses among architecture experts.

Rethink: Prince Charles at his new-build town of Poundbury in Dorset. He has written a ten-point guide for city architects which shuns wires, cars, concrete and tower blocks in favour of traditional principles

Professor Alister Scott of Birmingham City University attacked his often-quoted dismissal of high-rise towers in favour of Victorian-style mansion blocks, which exist in London's most expensive areas.

'The combined impact of these principles, when backed up with the examples he uses, is socially regressive and elitist,' Prof Scott told The Independent.

'When he considers the "charm and beauty of a place like Kensington and Chelsea" he sort of forgets that the average price of property is £2,085,950.'

He added that in Poundbury, the prince's experimental town in Dorset, the 'average detached house costs £458,946' - more than £60,000 above the national average. 

Other critics told the newspaper the manifesto sounded 'cranky' and like it was written by a 'fussy grandmaster of a masonic lodge'.

Transport planning consultant Phil Jones complained on Twitter about the prince's lack of formal sources for his claim, saying he had only consulted the government's Manual for Streets.

Out: The prince said tower blocks were 'isolating and alienating'. Pictured is the brutalist Shakespeare Tower in London's Barbican Centre, which remained the tallest residential block in Britain for several years

But there were some supporters, including Swedish architect Fredrik Hellberg, who wrote: 'Hats off for anyone who speaks up, no matter what they are saying.'

Randy Nishimura, a member of the American Institute of Architects, added: 'Some think of the Prince of Wales as a dilettante. I believe he sees the big picture while his critics do not.'

Prince Charles has been outspoken on architecture issues for many years.

He founded a School of Traditional Arts and supported the new-build village of Poundbury in Dorset, which was created on his land in a bid to challenge post-war ideas about planning.

His critics have accused him of trying to influence the government after he wrote personal memos to ministers, which the government has blocked from release in a nine-year legal fight.

In his piece, the prince insisted his ten-point plan 'does not deny the benefits and convenience that our modern technology brings.

'Far from it, the aim is to mix the best of the old with the best of the new.

Symmetry: The prince called on designers to follow traditional principles and ideas about beauty

'All I am suggesting is that the new alone is not enough. We have to be mindful of the long-term consequences of what we construct.' 

Writing in the magazine Architectural Review, the Prince added: 'I have lost count of the times I have been accused of wanting to turn the clock back to some Golden Age.

'Nothing could be further from my mind. My concern is the future.

'We face the terrifying prospect by 2050 of another three billion people on this planet needing to be housed, and architects and urban designers have an enormous role to play in responding to this challenge.'

He compared well-planned cities with a rose because humans do not have to think about why a rose is beautiful - they simply know it is.

Referencing 'spiritual mathematics' and 'sacred geometry', he said the best designs, including the Taj Mahal mausoleum in India, could be drawn from points around a basic circle. 

1 Developments must 'respect the land' and not be too intrusive

2 Buildings must abide by the 'language', 'grammar' and 'ground rules' of architecture

3 New blocks should not be oversized compared to the buildings surrounding them

4 There must be 'coherence' between nearby buildings by using similar balconies or railings

5 People need 'well-designed enclosures' which encourage walking and make them feel safe

6 Traditional or regional materials should beat 'bland' concrete, aluminium, glass and steel

7 Signs, lights and utilities should be avoided and as many wires as possible should be buried

8 Streets 'must be reclaimed from the car' and pedestrians must be put first in all designs

9 Shun 'isolating' high-rise towers and instead build mansion blocks like those in Chelsea

10 Be flexible to the situation, building and area - avoid following 'rigid, conventional' rules
