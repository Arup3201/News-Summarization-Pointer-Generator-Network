A  dinner with media mogul Rupert Murdoch was the reason Prime Minister Tony Abbott overhauled his media team late last year, it has been claimed.

Over Christmas, Mr Abbott dumped his press office director Jane McMillan, replacing her with former media adviser Andrew Hirst following the dinner with Mr Murdoch in December in Sydney, The Financial Review reported. The Prime Minister also hired former ABC journalist Mark Simkin to his office.

The revelation of the dinner comes after the media tycoon tweeted that Mr Abbott should sack his chief of staff Peta Credlin after his widely scorned decision to award British royal Prince Philip a knighthood on Australia Day.

Prime Minister Tony Abbott overhauled his media team at the end of last year after dining with media mogul Rupert Murdoch

The News Corp boss took to Twitter on Wednesday to urge Mr Abbott to either get rid of his loyal staffer or for Ms Credlin to 'do her patriotic duty and resign'.

During the dinner, Mr Murdoch is believed to have criticised both Mr Abbott and his government for having 'the wrong people' in the top communication roles, The Financial Review reported.

The publication also revealed Mr Murdoch has been calling Mr Abbott to complain about Ms Credlin, to whom the prime minister is fiercely loyal.

The dinner revelation comes as influential columnist and vocal Tony Abbott supporter Andrew Bolt also turned on the prime minister on Wednesday, calling his decision to knight Prince Phillip 'fatal' for his leadership.

He said the move could spell the end for Mr Abbott, branding the call 'damaging' no matter which perspective it was looked at from.

'This is just such a pathetically stupid - gosh, I didn't mean to be that strong because I actually like Tony Abbott very much - but this is just such a very, very, very stupid decision, so damaging that it could be fatal,' Mr Bolt told 2GB on Wednesday night.

'I thought it was verging on fatal already but this is too much.

On Wednesday Rupert Murdoch called for Prime Minister Tony Abbott to sack chief of staff Peta Credlin

'This is a friendless decision, where his friends would feel stupid defending it,' he said, according to the ABC.

Among other critics of the unpopular decision are prominent broadcaster Alan Jones and fellow columnist Miranda Devine. 

The criticisms of his decision come as a new poll for approval rating has slipped by more than 10 percent, with his approval rating at just 22 percent.

The same Seven News ReachTEL poll of 3,700 people nationwide also found that 72 percent of those surveyed disagreed with Mr Abbott's decision to knight Prince Phillip.

Malcom Turnbull is the preferred prime minister with a 45 percent approval rating, with Julie Bishop in second with 31 percent. Mr Abbott scored an approval rating of just 18 percent in the poll.

Labor is leading on primary vote with 40.2 percent to the Coalition's 39.7 percent.

But senior government figures are standing by Mr Abbott and his chief of staff despite some of his biggest backers raising questions over his latest moves.

Finance Minister Matthias Cormann says Mr Abbott has learnt a lesson from his unilateral decision about Prince Phillip, and had given an assurance there would be more consultation in the future.

He backed the prime minister with 'strong and unequivocal support'.

'He is the best person to lead the Liberal Party, to lead our country,' Senator Cormann said.

He's also standing by Ms Credlin, rejecting criticism she was blocking access to Mr Abbott.

'Not in any way, shape or form,' he said.

Cabinet colleague Sussan Ley responded to the latest polling by using a tennis analogy.

'Sometimes you can make a silly drop shot in the middle of the game and you can win that game and then go on to win the match,' she told reporters during a visit to the Australian Open in Melbourne.

Power player: Prime Minister Tony Abbott's chief adviser has been singled out by Rupert Murdoch

Ms Credlin was a 'terrific asset' to the prime minister's office and the Liberal Party.

Another frontbencher Michaelia Cash dismissed the criticism of Mr Murdoch and Bolt.

'When you're the prime minister of the country, when you're the chief of staff to the prime minister, you'll always have your critics,' she told Sky News.

Liberal senator Arthur Sinodinos, a former chief of staff to John Howard, also backed Ms Credlin.

'Peta's has a hard job. She's done it as well as she can,' he said.

Mr Abbott's parliamentary secretary Alan Tudge said Ms Credlin had been an outstanding contributor to the coalition team.

'I just say to Andrew Bolt and all of the other critics, let's just keep this decision in perspective,' he said.

But following public ridicule and dissension in his own ranks, the prime minister said on Wednesday he stood by his decision to knight the Duke of Edinburgh.

But he said he accepted people were upset by it. 'I respect their right to be critical... and I take it on the chin, I take it on the chin.'

Mr Abbott has insisted his decision was a 'captain's pick' and that he did not consult with Ms Credlin. 'There does need to be wider consultation around these awards in the future'.  

Ms Credlin has been the subject of internal dissent within the Liberal Party over the past year. 

Several unnamed MPs have told the press they are chafing under her tight direction of the Prime Minister's Office, or PMO.

Prime Minister Tony Abbott has stridently defended his top political operator, telling the ABC in December: 'Do you really think my chief of staff would be under this kind of criticism if her name was Peter as opposed to Peta?'

The remarks came after a frontbencher reportedly told The Australian that Ms Credlin and Foreign Minister Julie Bishop 'were like two Siamese fighting fish in the same tank' and that their relationship had broken down.

Education Minister Christopher Pyne today hailed Rupert Murdoch as one of the greatest Australians

Murdoch met with Ms Bishop in New York at the weekend, according to the Australian Financial Review.

A column by opinion writer Miranda Devine in the Daily Telegraph today said Ms Credlin was being blamed for Mr Abbott's gaffe and she should be sacrificed.

She suggested Mr Abbott replace her with News Corp columnist Chris Kenny, a former adviser to one-time Foreign Minister Alexander Downer. 

'The Prime Minister has to make a sacrificial offering to convince his colleagues that he has learned a lesson,' Devine wrote. 

'Something that causes him pain, like chopping off his right arm. In other words, moving on chief of staff Peta Credlin.

'Justly or not, she is being blamed for the Prince Philip gaffe.

'It was Abbott's decision but it's the job of the chief of staff, who he has been known to call the Boss, to stop him from making such a blunder.' 

Education Minister Christopher Pyne has already jumped to Ms Credlin's defence, saying she was 'absolutely intrinsic to our success'. 

'I support the chief of staff, Peta Credlin,' he said. 'I don't think there is any prospect of his suggestion being pursued by the government.' 

The Prime Minister stood be his decision to bestow a knigthood on Prince Philip, saying he had made a 'great contribution' to Australian public life.

'I accept that it's been a contentious decision – I absolutely accept that – and I absolutely respect people's rights to disagree with my call on this,' he said.

'But Prince Philip has been a distinguished servant of this country throughout a long and active public life.

'He's been part of some of the big events in our national life going back to the 1956 Olympics here in this city (Melbourne).

Mr Abbott pointed to the popularity of the Duke of Edinburgh Leadership Awards as one of his major contributions. 

Rupert Murdoch was far from the only figure to criticise Mr Abbott's 'captain's call'.

Queensland premier Campbell Newman, who is in the fight of his political life on the campaign trail, told reporters he disagreed with the decision and described it as a 'bolt from the blue'.

Nationals deputy leader Barnaby Joyce told ABC Radio: 'I'm always of the strong belief that all awards should be for Australians'. 

Backbencher Ewen Jones told the ABC he was fine for previous governors-general to be made knights and dame.
