Anger: Live on air Mr Paxman said Greece could be vomited out of the Euro like a bad kebab, to the anger of a guest

Jeremy Paxman has compared Greece's potential exit from the Euro to that of 'a bad kebab' being 'vomited out.'

The Newsnight presenter was given a tongue-lashing by a Greek guest and criticised on Twitter after his comments, made on the show last night, were branded 'offensive' and 'disrespectful' to the country and its people.

The abrasive BBC journalist was describing Greece's political and financial problems when he used the 'bad kebab' analogy to explain what the rest of the Eurozone may want to do with them.

But after he was criticised Mr Paxman backed down, not defending his analogy.

Greece has another election in mid-June, which could decide whether or not they stay in the Euro.

But as pro and anti-bailout parties are neck and neck in the polls another stalemate is possible, which could force Euro countries like Germany and France to throw them out themselves.

'So the rest of the Eurozone now contemplates something we were being 
told wasn't conceivable recently, that, like a bad kebab, Greece is 
vomited out of the single European currency, ' Mr Paxman said.Â 

But former Greek finance minister Giorgos Papakonstantinou then turned on him and told him off live on air last night.

Uncertainty: Greece is in a state of political and social turmoil, that could hasten its exit from the single European currency

'I take issue with your bad kebab analogy, which I find offensive,' he said.

'The Greek economy is in a crisis and the Greek people are going through a lot and they deserve some respect. I really did not find that very appropriate.'

Backed: Mr Papakonstantinou won the support of Twitter users, one of whom praised him for making Mr Paxman 'look a total idiot'

One tweeter backed Mr Papakonstantinou, writing: 'Paxman was made to look a total idiot by comparing the Greek economy to a bad kebab.'

Another added: 'That former Greek finance minister really slapped him down.'

Greece was forced to call a June 17 vote after a parliamentary 
election on May 6 left parliament divided evenly between groups of 
parties that support and oppose austerity conditions attached to a 130 
billion-euro rescue package agreed with lenders in March.

anti-bailout SYRIZA party

Meanwhile Irish voters are deciding whether their government can ratify the European Union's fiscal treaty, a deficit-fighting pact designed to bind Ireland and other debt-crippled eurozone members to tighter spending limits.

Both sides forecast victory ahead of Thursday's start of voting. Rejection could block Ireland from tapping loans from the EU's rescue fund in 2013 when Ireland's current supply of bailout cash runs out.

All polls during the campaign pointed to the treaty's approval, but similar polls were proved wrong when Ireland voted to reject EU treaties in 2001 and 2008

Comparison: But comparing the Euro decision to food poisoning from a kebab has upset some
