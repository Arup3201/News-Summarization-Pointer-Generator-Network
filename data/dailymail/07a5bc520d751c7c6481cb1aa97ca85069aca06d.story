Louis van Gaal admitted afterwards that this was a game Manchester United had to win to maintain their improbable title dream. But the luck they had been enjoying over six successive victories ran out.

This was another incomplete performance characterised by pedestrian build-up play. United controlled possession and had a significant territorial advantage. But aside from a period at the start of the second half, they never exerted the craft or drive needed to break down the Aston Villa defence. Ron Vlaar was back to his best and Jores Okore and Ciaran Clark impressed — even when Villa were inexplicably reduced to 10 men with Gabriel Agbonlahor’s red card 25 minutes from time.

United’s clinical finishing has outweighed brittle defending of late, but neither were evident here. Despite the presence of Radamel Falcao, Robin Van Persie and Wayne Rooney, sparks failed to fly.

Given the ground United have to make up on Chelsea, a draw away to Villa is, as Van Gaal admitted, ‘two points dropped’ even after falling behind to Christian Benteke’s opening goal of real quality.

Lee Mason is the most decisive referee in the select group with straight red cards, but sometimes he sees ones which are not there. When Gabriel Agbonlahor went into a strong challenge with Ashley Young it was hard to see who made the foul. Both were committed and the Villa man’s momentum meant he caught Young on the follow-through. Mason would not have been influenced by United’s players surrounding him and he had already decided. I hope the card is rescinded on appeal. FULL REVIEW HERE.

Falcao scored with a powerful header on his return to the side but his overall influence must improve. For long periods the Colombian struggled to impose himself.

Rooney, who had a good game, vocalised United’s disappointment. ‘We were pushing them and we had good possession but just couldn’t get a breakthrough,’ he said.

‘We’re paying the price for that now. We should have got three points, so we’re a bit disappointed and frustrated.’

From a player who had previously talked up United’s title challenge, the overall sentiment was clear.

Michael Carrick’s deployment in a three-man defence may have run its course. Darren Fletcher played in midfield due to the injury and illness of Ander Herrera and Marouane Fellaini respectively.

But the Scot could not provide the creative thrust of Carrick, who switched to midfield at half time as Tyler Blackett replaced Fletcher.

Van Gaal explained: ‘We kept the ball much better but we didn’t create so much because we were not looking to the forwards. That’s why I changed Darren Fletcher with Michael Carrick at half time, because I know he’s more a of a passer to the forwards.

‘But it was not good enough to get the victory here. We were not creative enough in the second half; we didn’t keep the ball as well as in the first half but we had more aggression. So that was the plus, I think.

‘Okay, we have a draw and that’s why I’m a little frustrated because we could have won this game, we didn’t and we are responsible.’

Asked if United could win the title, Van Gaal said: ‘No, because you have seen that you have to win these matches and we didn’t win. But there is still a long time to go.

‘When you want to be a part of the title race you have to win these games.’

Carrick predicted that Falcao is set to start showing his worth. ‘He’s scored so many goals over the years and you always feels when he gets that chance he will score. After being out for a bit that’s him back and hopefully he can go on a bit of a streak for us.’
