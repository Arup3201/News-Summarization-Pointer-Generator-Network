The hole in the ozone layer above the Antarctic was this year the second smallest it has been in two decades - but still covered an area roughly the size of North America, experts said today.

The average size of the Earth's protective shield was 6.9 million square miles (17.9 million square kilometers), according to satellite measurements by the National Oceanic and Atmospheric Administration and U.S. space agency Nasa.

Researchers say warm temperatures high in the atmosphere helped preserve it.

Nasa and NOAA have been monitoring the ozone layer on the ground and 
with a variety of instruments on satellites and balloons since the 
1970s.

Long-term ozone monitoring instruments have included TOMS, 
SBUV/2, Stratospheric Aerosol and Gas Experiment series of instruments, 
the Microwave Limb Sounder, the Ozone Monitoring Instrument, and the 
OMPS instrument on the Suomi NPP satellite.

'It happened to be a bit warmer this year high in the atmosphere above Antarctica, and that meant we didn't see quite as much ozone depletion as we saw last year, when it was colder,' said Jim Butler of NOAA's Earth System Research Laboratory in the Colorado city of Boulder.

The Antarctic ozone hole, which forms in September and October, reached its largest size for the season -- 8.2 million square miles, roughly the combined area of the United States, Mexico and Canada -- on September 22, NOAA said.

In comparison, the largest ozone hole recorded to date was one of 11.5 million square miles in the year 2000.

The ozone layer, which helps protect the Earth from potentially dangerous ultraviolet rays that can cause skin cancer and cataracts, began developing holes on an annual basis starting in the 1980s due to chlorofluorocarbons, or CFCs.

CFCs, once commonly used in refrigerators and aerosol cans, are now almost non-existent thanks to an international treaty signed on September 16, 1987, amid global concern over widening holes in the ozone layer.

Still, it could take another decade before scientists detect early signs that the ozone over the Antarctic is returning, NOAA said.

The ozone hole reached its maximum 
size on September 22, covering 8.2 million square miles (21.2 million square 
kilometers), or the area of the United States, Canada and Mexico 
combined.

The average size of the 2012 ozone hole was 6.9 million square miles (17.9 million square kilometers).

The September 6, 2000 ozone hole was the largest on record at 11.5 million square miles (29.9 million square kilometers).

The ozone layer above Antarctica likely will not return to its early 1980s state until about 2060, according to NASA scientist Paul Newman.

'The ozone hole mainly is caused by chlorine from human-produced 
chemicals, and these chlorine levels are still sizable in the Antarctic 
stratosphere,' he said.

'Natural fluctuations in 
weather patterns resulted in warmer stratospheric temperatures this 
year.

'These temperatures led to a smaller ozone hole.'

This year also showed a change in the concentration of ozone over the 
Antarctic.

The minimum value of total ozone in the ozone hole was the 
second highest level in two decades.

The ozone layer acts as Earth's natural shield against ultraviolet radiation, which can cause skin cancer.

The ozone hole phenomenon began making a yearly appearance in the early 1980s.

The Antarctic ozone layer will likely not return to its early 1980s state until about 2065, Newman said.

The lengthy recovery is because of the long lifetimes of ozone-depleting substances in the atmosphere.

Overall atmospheric ozone no longer is declining as concentrations of ozone-depleting substances decrease.

The decrease is the result of an international agreement regulating the production of certain chemicals.
