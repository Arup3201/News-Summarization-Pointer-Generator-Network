The Tories have moved in a two-point lead over Labour in the first of a series of polls

The Conservatives have moved into a two-point lead over Labour following a fall in support for Ukip, according to the first in a series of polls for the Daily Mail.

The ComRes survey reveals that the Tories are up three points in a month – on 34 per cent to Labour’s 32 – while Ukip has slipped four points to 13 per cent, its lowest ebb since early last year.

The poll confirms that with fewer than 75 days to go until the most unpredictable General Election for generations, Ed Miliband has become a significant drag on Labour’s fortunes.

More than 60 per cent of voters do not believe he would make a good prime minister and one in four say they would like to vote Labour but are put off by the party’s leader. 

Even among those saying they plan to vote Labour, a quarter brand Mr Miliband a turn-off, suggesting a significant chunk of his party’s support could be soft – from swing voters – and may decline by polling day.

There is also growing concern around the country at the prospect of a Labour government being propped up by the resurgent Scottish Nationalists if Mr Miliband falls short of a majority.

More than half of voters – 55 per cent – say the SNP should be barred from making decisions on laws that do not have an impact on Scotland if it becomes part of a coalition government.

Of the minor parties, the Greens are faring best. Their share of voters’ support has risen to 8 per cent – their highest showing with the pollster since 2010 – bringing them level with the Liberal Democrats.

Though the Conservatives have moved ahead of Labour, the poll is not all good news for Mr Cameron.

Voters are almost twice as likely to say that it is time for a change of government – 60 per cent – than say Britain should stay the course with the current leadership, an option favoured by 34 per cent.

Andrew Hawkins, chairman of ComRes, said the election ‘really is too close to call’ and it appeared ‘unlikely’ that any party could command a majority.

‘The most plausible outcomes are a minority government led by either David Cameron or Ed Miliband, or another coalition which could include the Lib Dems, SNP, Northern Ireland parties and possibly even Ukip or the Greens,’ he said.

‘Britain has not had two successive hung parliaments for more than 100 years. Our first-past-the-post electoral system was designed for stability. That is fine when you have a few strong parties, but as the combined popularity of the main parties has declined so the smaller ones have flourished.

Scottish Nationalist MPs should be barred from influencing laws that affect only the rest of the UK if they enter a coalition government at Westminster, a majority of voters believe.

ComRes found more than half of Britons – 57 per cent – concede that the SNP should be able to join a UK-wide coalition in the event of a hung parliament. But 55 per cent say it should be not be allowed to make decisions on laws that do not have an impact on Scotland.

Forecasts suggest the party is on course to hold the balance of power at Westminster, winning 30 or more Commons constituencies, 24 more than it currently holds.

Scotland’s First Minister Nicola Sturgeon has indicated she would be prepared to put Ed Miliband in Downing Street, doing a deal with Labour even if it has fewer seats than the Conservatives.

But in return the SNP will demand an end to the austerity which has put the economy back on its feet and insist on a £180 billion spending spree. David Cameron has said a Labour-SNP pact could break up and bankrupt Britain.

‘Twenty years ago, Labour’s vote share under Tony Blair reached peaks as high as 60 per cent, whereas the Tories and Labour can now manage only a little more than that combined.’

 Mr Hawkins added: ‘The political landscape has changed, probably permanently.

‘A system built for certainty is delivering the precise opposite . . . ComRes will be tracking voter opinion across the country throughout the coming campaign and afterwards – for not only is the election outcome hard to predict, but the uncertainty is likely to continue for weeks, months and possibly years to come.’

The latest weekly poll for Lord Ashcroft put Ukip on 11 per cent, a record low since the peer began national polling last May, though it gave Labour a four-point lead, with 36 per cent to the Tories’ 32 per cent.

Populus had the two main parties level pegging – with 32 per cent each – and Ukip on 15 per cent.

In his latest election campaign speech, Mr Cameron yesterday stepped up his pitch for the ‘grey vote’ as he explained his commitment to protect a raft of universal benefits if he wins a second term.

The Prime Minister said all pensioners would continue to receive the winter fuel allowance, free bus passes, TV licences for over-75s, and free prescriptions and eye tests as long as he is in office. Despite criticism that the elderly have been unfairly shielded from cuts targeted at working-age benefit claimants, Mr Cameron insisted the younger generation shared his priorities.

Speaking in Hastings, he said: ‘Older people need us. They have done so much for us – this is the least we can do for them.

‘And I’ll tell you what – the younger generation agree . . . Like me, [they] want nothing more than for the older generation to be given the dignity and security they deserve.’

He insisted Labour’s plans to means-test benefits for pensioners would save only a ‘paltry’ 4 per cent of their costs.

It may be a cliché, but the election on May 7th really is too close to call. The most plausible outcomes are a minority government led by either David Cameron or Ed Miliband, or another coalition which could include the Lib Dems, SNP, Northern Ireland parties and possibly even UKIP or the Greens. The one unlikely outcome at this stage appears to be a majority for any party.

This is not supposed to happen. Britain has not had two successive hung parliaments for more than 100 years. Our first-past-the-post electoral system was designed for stability. That is fine when you have a few strong parties, but as the combined popularity of the main parties has declined so the smaller ones have flourished. Twenty years ago Labour’s vote share under Tony Blair reached peaks as high as 60%, whereas the Tories and Labour can now manage only a little more than that combined.

The political landscape has changed, probably permanently. 

A system built for certainty is delivering the precise opposite.

 In the long term, this makes constitutional change look almost certain. Nothing is off the table, including House of Lords reform, online voting and giving 16- and 17-year-olds the vote. 

Just four years after the referendum on AV, we may even see proportional representation for general elections back on the cards.

In the shorter term, it looks increasingly likely that Labour will have more seats than the Conservatives in May but get fewer votes. 

Today sees the launch of our new poll series for the Daily Mail, and it reveals a nation anxious for political change but just as nervous about Ed Miliband as Prime Minister.

If, as today’s voting intention poll finds, Labour ends up two percentage points behind the Tories nationally, the electorate will have reluctantly thrust Mr Miliband into the top job with a pitifully small and probably unsustainable mandate.

That is why it is so important to be able to bring the very latest political insight and analysis to Daily Mail readers. ComRes will be tracking voter opinion across the country throughout the coming campaign and afterwards. 

For not only is the election outcome hard to predict, but the uncertainty is likely to continue for weeks, months and possibly years to come.
