Ben Thomas, 5, suffered from Staphylococcal scalded skin syndrome (SSSS) which caused his skin to blister and peel away

A little boy is lucky to be alive after suffering a painful rash that caused 99 per cent of the skin on his body to scald and peel away. 

Five year-old Ben Thomas, from Waltham Abbey, Essex, spent three weeks in intensive care after eventually being diagnosed with Staphylococcal scalded skin syndrome (SSSS) – a condition where bacteria causes the outer layer of skin to shed.

But doctors misdiagnosed his condition twice, at first prescribing antibiotics as they thought it was tonsillitis.

Then, as the rash got worse, they misdiagnosed him with another rare condition.

Believing he had Steven-Johnsons Syndrome - a severe allergic reaction to antibiotics - they took him off the drugs in the hope the rash would go down.

But after 18 hours off medication, the rash was getting worse.

A new doctor instantly recognised the condition as SSSS and screamed that Ben should be put back on antibiotics instantly.

But it was too late by then, and Ben's mother, Annette Devonshire, 38, had to watch helplessly while her little boy spent three weeks in intensive care at the burns unit at Broomfield Hospital in Chelmsford and lost 99 per cent of his skin.

Now recovering at home, he has been left with scarring, has difficulty sleeping and has to walk on his tiptoes as the skin on the back of his legs is so tight.

Ms Devonshire, a cleaner, said she felt powerless being unable to comfort her son while he was in pain.

She said: 'He was covered head to toe in bandages, like a mummy.

'You feel totally helpless, it's a feeling you only know if your child has been sick. I'm not religious but I prayed for Ben.

'I couldn't even give him a cuddle because he'd be left in agony.'

Ben's symptoms first appeared as a red rash around his mouth, and then some spots across his body.

At first Ms Devonshire didn't think it was anything to worry about.

Ben's rash, initially around his mouth and with a few spots on his chest, got worse and his entire body began to blister. Eventually he lost 99 per cent of his skin (his face is pictured left and his leg pictured right)

Initially doctors said Ben had tonsillitis (right) but after the rash got worse he was eventually sent to intensive care. He has been left with scarring and has to sometimes walk on tiptoes as his skin is so tight

She said: 'I called the NHS line, but he seemed fine in himself still - he even went out for a bounce on the trampoline.

'That was at nine in the morning, but by three in the afternoon he was lying on the sofa poorly.

'I tried to take him to bed and he screamed in pain.

She took Ben to Princess Alexandra Hospital in Harlow, where he was misdiagnosed with tonsillitis and sent away with antibiotics.

Staphylococcal scalded skin syndrome is a widespread painful rash caused by bacteria. 

This germ produces a toxin that causes the outer layer of the skin to be shed. 

The toxin is removed by the immune system and the kidneys.

If either is not working properly the toxin can circulate in the blood and can then affect most of the body’s surface. 

In young children, especially newborns, the immune system and kidneys are not fully developed, and this explains why they are most commonly affected. 

The original infection may be relatively minor, for example an infected graze or a red sticky eye. 

After a few days a widespread patchy red rash appears and rapidly joins up to cover most of the skin surface. 

Unlike most rashes it is painful and affected children are miserable and feverish and may not want to be held or touched.

Soon there is loosening of skin, which can detach from the underlying layers, sometimes with easily-torn, fluid-filled blisters.

If large areas of skin are shed, body fluid and salts can be lost causing dehydration, and further infection may get through into the bloodstream. 

The infection is treated with oral antibiotics, which in severe cases may be given through a vein. 

The skin needs gentle cleansing and soothing creams or dressings, which may include antibiotics or antiseptics.

Special medical care is needed if fluid or salt balance is affected, or if there is a blood infection.

Hours later his rash had spread and was starting to blister so Ms Devonshire rushed him back to the hospital.

There, Ben was once again misdiagnosed, this time with Stevens-Johnson Syndrome, an allergic reaction to antibiotics or epilepsy medicine which can cause a rash.

Doctors took him off antibiotics, but in the morning, a new doctor - who instantly recognised it wasn't Steven-Johnson Syndrome but Staphylococcal scalded skin syndrome - and shouted that he needed to be put back on medication immediately, Ms Devonshire claims.

In most cases, SSSS  can be completely cured  if antibiotics are given in the early stages, but if large areas of skin are shed, body fluid and salts can be lost causing dehydration, and further infection may get through into the bloodstream.

After being off antibiotics overnight, Ben now had to be sent to a specialist burns unit for treatment.

Ms Devonshire said: 'Ben was off medication for about 18 hours. 

'When the ward doctor came round the next morning he knew straight away what it was and screamed to get Ben back on antibiotics.

'By then it was too late and they had to decide whether he should go to Great Ormond Street or a specialist burns unit.'

Ben was transferred to the burns unit at Broomfield hospital in Chelmsford.

He spent three weeks in intensive care and a week on the general ward before being allowed home.

Ms Devonshire said her son is still suffering and they expect he will have scars for life.

She said: 'Ben is still really itchy at night and it stops him sleeping and makes him tired for school. It's a nuisance for him.

'He was first diagnosed with SSSS at the end of June and he's still suffering now.

'The bacteria got past the epidermal layer on his legs so he's still recovering and we expect there will be some scarring.

'He has to walk on his tip toes sometimes because the skin on the back of his legs is so tight. It's like he has really bad sunburn.'
