The night sky of central Sydney will be awash with colour for 18 days, starting this Friday.

Vivid Sydney is back for another year, and organisers are promising a bigger and better than ever before.

Winner of Australian Event of the Year at the 2013 Australian Event Awards, last year's event excited more than 800,000 visitors and generated more than $20 million for the New South Wales economy.

'The sails of the Opera House will be splashed with colour, and the harbour foreshore and surrounds crisscrossed with breathtaking 3D-mapped projections for this signature event,' Destination NSW CEO Sandra Chipchase said.

Each evening from 6pm, for the duration of the festival, light shows will be projected on to the Sydney Opera House, Customs House and Museum of Contemporary Art.

Extending the light show precinct to include Martin Place for the first time this year, interactive art will be taken to a more personal level - with attendees able to map their face onto a 3D, 1.6 metre head.
