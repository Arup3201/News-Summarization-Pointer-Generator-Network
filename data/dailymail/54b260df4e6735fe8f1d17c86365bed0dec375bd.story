A new federal investigation has revealed that two planes nearly crashed into each other as one was landing and another was taking off at Newark Airport last month.

The National Transportation Safety Board report classified the April 24 incident between a United flight coming from San Francisco and an ExpressJet flight bound for Memphis as a near midair collision.

According to the report, the planes came within approximately 200 feet laterally and were separated by about 400 feet vertically.

Little room to spare: The planes were 400 feet away from each other vertically but only 200 feet laterally, and the outbound pilot is heard telling air traffic control that he was 'real close' to the other plane

Near miss: As the planes continued on their routes, they came closer and closer to hitting

The United flight was carrying 155 
passengers and six crew members. The ExpressJet flight was carrying 47 
passengers and three crew members.

According
 to the NTSB report, an air traffic controller waited for another plane 
to land on the east-west runway, then cleared the ExpressJet to take off
 heading north.

At that
 point, the United flight was about three miles away. By the time the 
ExpressJet flight started its takeoff roll, the United flight was about 
one mile away.

As the two planes approached each other, the United flight was ordered by the tower to abort its landing and go back up.

The ExpressJet pilot can be heard on radio telling air traffic controllers he was keeping the plane's nose down as he climbed.

Close call: A United Airlines 737 jet landing at Newark nearly collided into a smaller plane that was taking off in April (not pictured)

At one point he tells the tower the United flight came 'real close' to him.

The incident occurred at the northeast corner of the airport, where two north-south runways intersect with Runway 29, an east-west runway.

Runway 29, shorter by about one-third than the two north-south runways, normally is used to provide additional capacity or offer an alternative if high winds make the other two more treacherous.

It has been used more frequently since the Port Authority of New York and New Jersey- which operates the airport- began a 60-day rehabilitation of one of the two north-south runways at the beginning of April.

An official with the air traffic controllers' union at Newark Liberty didn't immediately respond to a message seeking comment Monday.

The landing plane was told to abort and go back up in the air when the control tower realized how close it was to an accident

Problem was caused by one plane taking off from a rarely-used runway that intersects with a busier, longer runway
