Faint signs of water have been found in the atmospheres of five distant planets beyond our solar system.

The exoplanets are all scorching ‘hot Jupiters’ - a term given to massive worlds that orbit close to their stars.

Because they are so hot, scientists believe the planets are unlikely to support life as we know it.

Scientists found faint signatures of water in the atmospheres of five distant planets. All five planets appear to be hazy. This illustration shows a star's light illuminating the atmosphere of a planet

To determine what’s in the atmosphere of 
an exoplanet, astronomers watch the planet pass in front of its host 
star.

When this happens, some of the star's light passes through the planet's atmosphere.

This interaction imprints information on the composition and motion of the planet's atmosphere into the star's light.

Scientsts can then analyse which wavelengths of light are transmitted and which are partially absorbed to detemine whether water is present in the atmosphere of the planet.

However, the finding still marks an important step forward in the search for alien life, the researchers said.

‘We're very confident that we see a water signature for multiple planets,’ said Avi Mandell of Nasa’s Goddard Space Flight Center.

‘This work really opens the door for comparing how much water is present in atmospheres on different kinds of exoplanets — for example, hotter versus cooler ones.’

The presence of atmospheric water has been reported previously on exoplanets orbiting stars beyond our solar system.

However, this is the first study to measure and compare the profiles and intensities of these signatures on multiple worlds.

The team used Hubble's Wide Field Camera 3 to analyse the atmospheres of the five planets, named WASP-17b, HD209458b, WASP-12b, WASP-19b and XO-1b.

The strengths of their water signatures varied with WASP-17b described as having an ‘especially puffed-up atmosphere’.

‘To actually detect the atmosphere of an exoplanet is extraordinarily difficult. But we were able to pull out a very clear signal, and it is water,’ said Drake Deming of the University of Maryland.

To determine what’s in the atmosphere of an exoplanet, astronomers watch the planet pass in front of its host star and look at which wavelengths of light are transmitted and which are partially absorbed.

The water signals were all less pronounced than expected, and the scientists suspect this is because a layer of haze or dust blankets each of the five planets.

Hubble's high-performance Wide Field Camera 3 is one of few capable of peering into the atmospheres of exoplanets many trillions of miles away

This haze can reduce the intensity of all signals from the atmosphere in the same way fog can make colours in a photograph appear muted.

At the same time, haze alters the profiles of water signals and other important molecules in a distinctive way.

‘These studies, combined with other Hubble observations, are showing us that there are a surprisingly large number of systems for which the signal of water is either attenuated or completely absent,’ said Heather Knutson of the California Institute of Technology in Pasadena.

‘This suggests that cloudy or hazy atmospheres may in fact be rather common for hot Jupiters.’
