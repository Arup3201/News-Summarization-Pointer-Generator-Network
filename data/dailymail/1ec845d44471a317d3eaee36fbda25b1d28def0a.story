A prisoner has been arrested after reportedly threatening to set himself on fire.

The 44-year-old man who had a device strapped to his body surrendered after police negotiations at Barwon maximum security prison on Friday morning.  

'Police were called to the correctional facility just before 9.30am and began negotiating with the 44-year-old,' a police spokesperson said.

Police are now assessing the device which Corrections Victoria suggested was thought to be ground up match heads. 

'Members from the Critical Incident Response Team (CIRT) attended the scene with Bomb Response Unit members,' police said.

'The man surrendered without incident around 11.30am and was returned to custody.

'Police will now assess a device that was located on the man.'

The man allegedly had an 'Irish Republican Army flag' strapped to his body, according to Nine News.

Earlier, a Victoria Police spokesperson told Daily Mail Australia: 'Police are currently in negotiations with a man at a corrections centre in Lara.

'Emergency services were called to the facility just before 9.30am and a number of specialists are en route to the scene.'

The prison is located 6 kilometres  from the township of Lara. 

Corrections Victoria spokesman Michael Newhouse told the Herald Sun: 'There is no immediate threat to staff or other prisoners, and no evacuations are required at this stage.'  

The prison is home to some of the state's most notorious underworld figures, bikies and violent offenders

In July, the prison, which is home to some of the state's most notorious underworld figures, bikies and violent offenders, was in lockdown after a small explosion, believed to have been triggered by a parcel bomb.

The explosion occurred in an unoccupied cell at Barwon Prison near Geelong and a second bomb is believed to have been discovered before it detonated.

The jail was locked down an hour earlier than usual for the day, while emergency authorities were on site.

Barwon Prison was where Melbourne gangland boss Carl Williams was bashed to death by Matthew Johnson in the high-security Acacia section of the prison in 2010.

Fellow underworld boss Tony Mokbell is also held there, as is multiple murderer and rapist, Peter Dupas.
