Running battles have broken out between police and protesters outside a British oil refinery facing mass job cuts.

Today violence erupted at the Coryton plant in Essex where its Swiss-based owners Petroplus have collapsed and left at least 200 out of work.

Essex police have arrested three people at the scene after they clashed with union members and political activists.

Out of hand: Protesters blockaded the site in Essex and police were called in to break it up

Battle: A protester is cuffed and dragged off as violence breaks out at the Coryton refinery in Essex this afternoon

Anger: People are on a picket line at the site because around 200 people could lose their jobs

About 850 people work at the refinery in
Stanford-le-Hope near Thurrock, and it is feared that unless another 
company steps in all the workers could lose their jobs.

Just yesterday Labour leader Ed Miliband said the Government's decision not to give financial backing to the refinery was 'completely wrong'.

'I think they are showing an absolute abdication of their responsibility to the workers at Coryton,' the Labour leader said.

Trouble: This man is cuffed and detained by two police officers today

Fury: A young man screams at a policeman as he tries to push the line of people back away from the gates

The Department for Energy and Climate Change claimed it would not be sustainable for the government to provide assistance.

Administrators PricewaterhouseCoopers have said the 200 jobs would go this week, which led to the picket line outside.

Meanwhile The UK's second biggest oil refinery, near Ellesmere Port, Cheshire, reported a big financial loss but its new owner said an efficiency drive will help it make money even when oil prices fall.

Support: Around 100 Coryton Oil Refinery workers and their supporters were there as 200 workers lose their jobs this week

Battle: Police push people back from the refinery gates but soon afterwards violence breaks out

Stuck: Drivers were unable to move their trucks out of the refinery today when trouble flared

Supermarket Asda is cutting the price of petrol.

From
tomorrow customers at Asda’s 196 filling stations will pay no more than
127.7p a litre for petrol and no more than 132.7p a litre for diesel.

Asda said this was the lowest price for a litre of fuel since February 2011.

The
latest cut means Asda has shaved 14p off the cost of a litre of fuel 
since the end of April, reducing the cost of filling up a family car by 
almost £10.

Sainsbury’s said it was reducing its fuel prices too, with petrol and diesel coming down 'by up to 2p per litre' from tomorrow.

The AA said the 14p Asda reduction since April was welcome.

While
Asda had dropped its petrol price largely in line with wholesale, the 
UK average was down 10.5p a litre since the record high in mid-April.

Tesco is also dropping prices, with its petrol and diesel coming down by up to 2p a litre from tomorrow.

India-focused Essar Energy bought the 
Stanlow refinery, which accounts for 15% of production from UK 
refineries and produces around 1.5 billion litres of kerosene a year for
aircraft fuel, from oil giant Shell in July.

The
operation made an underlying loss of 30.2 million US dollars (£19.4 
million) in the first eight months under new ownership as refining 
margins in northern Europe were squeezed by overcapacity.

But its plans to make efficiency savings and diversify the business into producing more oil-based chemicals and diesel are expected to add two to three US dollars on the margin on a barrel of oil over the next three years.

This would mean that the operation would provide 'attractive returns' throughout the market cycle.

The company said: 'In the UK, work is well under way on various projects aimed at increasing margins at our Stanlow refinery following its acquisition at the end of July 2011.

'Stanlow is operating in a tough European refining market, but we continue to see signs that uneconomic refining capacity is being removed from the market which we expect to have a positive impact on margins.'

Stanlow, which supplies Manchester airport with jet fuel, saw supplies disrupted earlier this month, leading to some flights being delayed.

The group saw profits slump nearly two-thirds to 129 million US dollars (£82.7 million) in the 15 months to March 31 compared with the previous 12 months.
