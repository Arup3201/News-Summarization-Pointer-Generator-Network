JOSE MOURINHO VS LIVERPOOL

Played 19, Won 10, Drawn 4, Loss 5

Win percentage: 52.6% 

Jose Mourinho's record against Liverpool as Chelsea boss is good, losing just five of 19 games. He has only faced Liverpool once before in the League Cup, but it was a key game - the 2005 final that gave Jose his first trophy in England.

CLASSIC CUP CLASHES

Liverpool 2-3 Chelsea (League Cup final, February 2005)

John Arne Riise’s goal after 45 seconds was the quickest in a League Cup final but Steven Gerrard’s own goal sent the game to extra-time.

Mourinho was sent to the stands for shushing the Liverpool fans and extra-time goals from Didier Drogba and Mateja Kezman sealed a Chelsea win.

Liverpool 1-0 Chelsea (Champions League semi-final 2nd leg, May 2005)

Five months on from defeat in Cardiff, Liverpool had their revenge.

After a 0-0 draw in the first leg, Luis Garcia’s ‘ghost goal’ - which Mourinho insisted never crossed the line - saw Liverpool through to that famous final in Istanbul.

CESC'S CHALLENGE

When Cesc Fabregas left Barcelona in the summer, the club explained one of the reasons for selling him was a ‘downward trend in his stats every season’. They claimed Cesc was rarely as good in the second half of the season as he was in the first.

Well, the way he has been playing in the first half of this campaign is better than most players manage over the course of four or five seasons!

The Barcelona statement stuck in my mind and it certainly will have stayed with Cesc. The challenge for him now is to continue his sensational run of performances.

The stats show Barcelona might have had a point, as his performances do tend to tail off in the second half of the season.

But now he has a manager who will be all over him if he doesn’t perform.

The way Chelsea are going, though, it’s hard to see him doing anything other than play well. Expect him to be pulling the strings tonight.

GERRARD'S FAREWELL TOUR

The next few months will feel a bit like an open-top bus parade for Steven Gerrard as he gets ready to bid farewell to Anfield, but I’m sure he will want to make a quick detour to Wembley.

This is a fantastic opportunity for Liverpool to win a trophy and it’s poignant that tonight’s game is against Chelsea, a team that so nearly plucked Gerrard from Anfield.

He could have left and won many more trophies, but he stayed true to his boyhood club and they will be desperate for him to win one more before he leaves.

BACK TO BASICS 

Brendan Rodgers is a coach who believes strongly in his own attacking philosophy.

He sticks to his principles, sometimes to the detriment of the team. If Rodgers persists with his preferred back three, Chelsea’s wide men will tear them apart

A conventional back four would increase their solidity, so it will be interesting to see how Brendan goes.

NOW WE'LL SEE WHAT MOURINHO HAS LEARNED

After losing 5-3 to Tottenham Hotspur at White Hart Lane, I felt we would only see what Jose made of that defeat the next time he faced a big team on the road.

That’s no disrespect to Swansea City, but Jose played his best team on Saturday. He has a tendency to be more cautious against the top sides away from home.

The Spurs defeat will have created doubt in his mind and it might be that he puts another holding midfielder alongside Nemanja Matic on Tuesday night.
