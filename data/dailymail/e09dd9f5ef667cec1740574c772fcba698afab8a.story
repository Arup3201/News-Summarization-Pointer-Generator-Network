As a motorcyclist weaves through traffic, it can be easy to miss their bike’s brake lights and indicators tucked below a car driver’s view.

To help make such riders more visible, an Arkansas firm has created the ultimate safety helmet accessory.

The MotoGlo Light can be fitted to any current helmet and features LEDs that glow depending on whether the rider is braking or turning.

It was created by electronics firm Whistler Group.

The receiver attaches to any three-quarter, or full-face helmet to increase rider visibility while on the road.

Sensors built into the device can detect when a bike is slowing down, or changing direction. 

The LEDs will then glow across the device to indicate the rider is braking, or only light up on the side the bike is turning.

It is battery-powered and runs for 12 hours on a single charge. It can also be recharged in under an hour using a USB cable.

‘The MotoGlo is literally head and shoulders above traditional motorcycle lighting.

‘The increased rider visibility to following drivers improves everyone’s safety,’ said Steve Sanders, Product Development Manager at Whistler.

Earlier
 this week, a team of entrepreneurs unveiled a radar for cyclists that 
gives riders the speed and distance of vehicles coming up behind them.

A rear-mounted light also warns motorists of the cyclist’s presence by flashing furiously the closer they get.

Comprised of two gadgets that clip onto a bike, the system has been designed to allay fears of being hit from behind by a car.

A microradar mounted on the handlebars detects and tracks cars behind a bike.

It gives a cyclist the speed and distance of rear approaching vehicles from up to 150 yards (140 metres) away.

Whistler will begin shipping the MotoGlo in late July 2014 for $139.95 (£81).

Inventors Tyhey claim the device gives cyclists a 'sixth sense' and boosts their safety and the group is raising money to put the device into production.

It is expected to ship in December and can be pre-ordered from $199 (£116).
