A solemn occasion turned into a violent attack on Tuesday after mourners beat a driver who honked his horn outside a church where the funeral was to be held.

A witness caught the incident outside La Iglesia de Dios in Mount Holly, New Jersey on camera.

Emotions were already running high when the driver of a red Chevrolet, irritated at funeral-goers who were holding up traffic, honked his horn.
