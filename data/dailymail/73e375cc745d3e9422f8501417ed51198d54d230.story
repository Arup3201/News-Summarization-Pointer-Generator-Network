Gas prices are falling across the country leading to the lowest prices at the pump in five years.

For drivers, shippers, airlines and other consumers of fuel, there's nothing not to like about downward trend.

The national average gasoline price has fallen for 81 straight days to $2.55 a gallon, its lowest level since October of 2009, according to AAA. 

It's $1.15 a gallon cheaper than its high for the year, saving U.S. households $100 a month as they shop for holiday presents.

"Any time gas prices go down that is a good thing," said Randy Daniels, 30, who was shopping recently at the Lenox Square Mall in Atlanta. "An extra 20 or 30 bucks in my pocket goes far."

Diesel and jet fuel prices have also plunged, helping boost the profits and share prices of airlines and shippers. 

The cheapest gas in the country is currently being sold in Missouri, where the average price per gallon is $2.23. It's probably no surprise that Hawaii has the most expensive gas, at $3.69 a gallon 

The plunge in gasoline prices that is showing no signs of slowing has dropped the national average price to $2.60 a gallon, its lowest level since December of 2009.

It's saving a typical household $60 a month compared to last year around this time, enough for an extra holiday gift or two.

Here are the 5 cheapest and 5 most expensive states for gasoline in the lower 48 states as of Friday, according to AAA. 

LOWEST STATE AVERAGES

Missouri - $2.32

Oklahoma - $2.36

Texas - $2.38

Mississippi - $2.39

South Carolina - $2.40

HIGHEST STATE AVERAGES

New York - $3.02

Connecticut - $2.96

Vermont - $2.94

California - $2.92

Washington - $2.90 

The most expensive gas in the lower 48 states was in San Francisco, where it goes for $3.04 per gallon.

Heating oil is the cheapest it has been in four years, reducing home heating prices just in time for winter for many in the chilly Northeast.

The price per barrel for crude oil has dropped 41 percent since the end of 2013, from $98.17 to $57.49. 

Prices are expected to continue to drop – especially in wake of a statement from the Organization of Petroleum Exporting Countries saying that it has no set price for oil.

The price of oil has fallen by nearly half in just six months, a surprising and steep plunge that has consumers cheering, producers howling and economists wringing their hands over whether this is a good or bad thing.

The price of a barrel of oil is just under $56, down from a summer high of $107, and lower than at any time since the U.S. was still in recession in the spring of 2009.

The plunge in prices is being blamed on a global imbalance of supply and demand that is rippling across the world economy, for better and worse.

Years of high oil prices, interrupted briefly by the recession, inspired drillers around the world to scour the earth's crust for more oil and they found it.

Since 2008 oil companies in the U.S., for example, have increased production by 70 percent, or 3.5 million barrels of oil per day. To put that in perspective, that increase alone is more than the production of any OPEC member other than Saudi Arabia.

As U.S. production was ramping up, turmoil in the Middle East and North Africa reduced supplies from Libya, Iran and elsewhere. 

More to come? Oil prices have dropped sharply around the world, easing gasoline costs for U.S. driver 

A balance was struck: Increasing supplies from outside of OPEC and from Iraq's recovering oil industry helped meet rising demand around the world as other OPEC supplies waivered.

But now those OPEC supplies look more certain despite continuing turmoil, and those non-OPEC supplies have swamped the market. OPEC estimated last week that the world would need 28.9 million barrels of its oil per day next year, the lowest in more than a decade.

At the same time, OPEC countries plan to produce 30 million barrels of oil per day next year. That supply surplus is sending global prices lower.
