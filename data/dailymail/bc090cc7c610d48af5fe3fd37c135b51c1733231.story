Kristy Cruise is one of a growing number of Australians traveling overseas to receive controversial stem cell transplant treatments

In a desperate attempt to stop the disease that was ravaging her body, Kristy Cruise booked a flight to Moscow and forked out $40,000 to receive risky stem cell transplant treatment.

The 36-year-old mother-of-two, who was diagnosed with Multiple Sclerosis early last year, is now leading the way for a growing number of Aussies who aren't prepared to wait for medical trials to be approved in Australia.

After suffering from constant bone pain, pins and needles and cognitive dysfunction before finally being hospitalized and unable to walk for four days, Kristy says she is now completely cured and is in the process of directing 80 other Australians with MS through the same treatment.

'It just hit me when I was in hospital. I was in there for four days because I wasn't able to walk properly and I was just feeling so miserable and I realised that this is going to be the rest of my life - not working, not being able to be a mum,' Kristy told the Daily Mail Australia.

'Before I went to Russia, I really couldn't be a mum. I couldn't take them anywhere alone, I couldn't pick them up and drop them off at school most of the time', the heartbroken mum revealed.

'The dialogue they constantly heard was "mummy is too tired, mummy doesn't feel very well", so I wasn't present, I just wasn't an active mother in their lives.'

The mother-of-two flew to Moscow in 2013 where she payed $40,000 for her treatment after her suffering from Multiple Sclerosis escalated

Kristy is one of 23,000 Australians living with Multiple Sclerosis (MS), a disease of the central nervous system which affects the way electrical pulse messages are sent from the brain and spinal chord to the rest of the body.  The disease exhibits itself in random episodes or attacks, where patients may lose function of parts of their body for certain periods of time. However in the majority of MS sufferers, the disease continues to progress over time, deteriorating their body slowly.

According to Dr John Moore, a senior staff specialist in hematology at St Vincent's hospital in Sydney, there is no cure for MS, but various treatments are available to suppress the frequency of such attacks.

Dr Moore is also the principle investigator of a phase two study into Stem cell transplantation in auto immune diseases at St Vincent's, where only nine patients have been given the treatment - all with positive results.

There is no cure for MS, and although studies into the benefits of stem cell therapy for the disease continue around the world, it has not yet been approved in Australia

Kristy spent five weeks in Moscow undergoing the treatment which involved intensive chemo therapy and her stem cells being drawn out of her body and filtered before being replaced

Similar research has been conducted around the world since 1996, with many country's offering the procedure for high fees.  But the treatments have not yet been approved in Australia due to ethical reasons.

'We could do it here – we could set it up in a private hospital but we don't think that it's ethical,' Dr Moore said.

'It definitely works, but we don't know which patients it works best with and we don't know if it's better than the current standard treatment.

Dr John Moore, the principle investigator of a study into the treatment in auto immune diseases at St Vincent's, said the procedure is incredibly risky

'This is not a simple procedure. It is a risky procedure and there is a risk of dying from complications.'

Despite begging Dr Moore over the phone for hours, Kristy was told she would not be accepted for treatment under the Australian study.

'It's very hard to qualify and I knew I might have to spend years and year jumping through hoops trying to qualify while I grew more disabled,' she said.

'The hardest part for me is financial. I wasn't too concerned about going overseas generally speaking, but financial it is difficult because by going overseas I've saved the Australian government about $100,000 a year – drugs for my MS would have costed $60,000 a year, plus neurologist appointments and not to mention the disability support pension.

'I've saved the Australian government over a million dollars throughout my lifetime easily, and I'm being denied access to my own super to pay for it, so from a financial point of view it’s a real travesty.'

But it has all been worth it, according to the former emergency nurse, with the symptoms being completely cleared after just five weeks in Moscow.

Before leaving to Moscow constantly  felt debilitating fatigue and vertigo, had cognitive issues and memory loss, the left side of her body was often numb and random attacks left her unable to walk for days

Pictured here with her husband Keith, Kristy says she has had a complete recovery and no longer suffers from the same symptoms

She is now completely mobile, her cognitive fog has lifted and she runs up to five kilometres a day

'Before I left, I was feeling debilitating fatigue, I had constant vertigo, I was having cognitive issues memory loss, confusion, I had a numb left side of my body, the sensation of bugs crawling around my head and shoulders,' Kristy said.

'When I left home, depending on the day, I had to use a wheelchair or a walking aid just because I would get out of my car at the supermarket and be so fatigued that I'd have to go straight back home.

'Now, I've had 100 per cent improvement. The cognitive fog has lifted, I'm 100 percent mobile -I regularly do five kilometre runs - It felt like I was back in the body I had 10 years ago.'

The process involved four days of injections that would draw the stem cells which normally sit inside the bone marrow, into the blood stream. Then, Kristy spent eight hours lying flat while the stem cells were drawn out of her blood stream. After four days of high intensity chemo therapy, the stem cells were transplanted back into her body.

After her stem cells (pictured) were placed back in her body, Kristy spent 10 days in isolation while her immune system rebuilt itself: 'My immune system was down to zero which means that a simple cold could kill you,' she said

Mr Moore described the process as  'growing a new immune system' and said it is the most risky process of the procedure as the patient's immune system has been suppressed.

'My immune system was down to zero which means that a simple cold could kill you,' Kristy said.

She thus spent 10 days in isolation while her immune system rebuilt itself, however it will take at least six months in total.

Now, the active mother spends her days inspiring others through her success story. She works about 50 hours a week, not for profit, traveling around the country and giving talks about her experience. She has also been supporting 80 other Australians with MS to undertake the same HSTC procedure overseas, and is currently working as an interpreter for her former Russian doctor.

'I am now on a mission to raise awareness of the treatment option for all the Australians suffering from MS,' she said.

'Dozens of MS patients are being effectively cured of their disease each month around the world, we just need to fight for the right to received HSCT in Australia.'

In the meantime, the studies and trials may be some time away from releasing definitive results for the treatment in other types of diseases.

'We are going to join a trial, that has started in the US, comparing stem cell transplants to the best available MS treatments and that trial will take about three years to complete and then another year to follow up,' Dr Moore said.

'But by then we will have a better idea of where MS stem cell transplants could fit into peoples treatments and which patients will best benefit.'
