A senator's daughter has passed away suddenly from a blood clot a month after she suffered injuries in a hit-and-run on Capitol Hill.

Lisa Radogno, the daughter of Illinois Senate Republican leader Christine Radogno and herself a senate staffer in Washington, D.C., died from the blood clot in her lung in hospital on Wednesday.

The 31-year-old had returned to work as an executive assistant in the office of Illinois Senator Mark Kirk following a hit-and-run on May 8, in which she suffered injuries to her wrist and knee.

An autopsy will determine if the blood clot stemmed from the crash, but an aide for her mother said they believed the two incidents were connected.

Loss: Lisa Radogno, 31, passed away on Wednesday after she suffered a massive pulmonary embolism

'My understanding is the embolism 
was the result, a complication, following the hit-and-run accident,' Radogno spokeswoman 
Patty Schuh told NBC Chicago.

Police are still looking for the driver, who was behind the wheel of a white, four-door 2011 Nissan Maxima with Maryland tags when Radogno was hit as she crossed the street at East Capitol Street.

The driver didn't stop and Radogno sought treatment for her injuries, before returning to her mother's home in Illinois to recuperate and 'get her life back'.

After the break, Radogno, who was single, returned to work and to her home in D.C. She had worked in the role for seven years.

Heartbroken: Her mother, Illinois Republican Senate Leader Christine Radogno (pictured earlier this month), said on Wednesday that the loss of her middle daughter was 'beyond painful'

Radogno shared this photo of her daughter, with her visible hit and run injuries, holding one of her newborn twin nieces

Loved: Lisa, a staffer to an Illinois senator in Washington D.C., was knocked over in a hit-and-run last month and suffered injuries. Her mother's aide said they believed the clot was connected to the crash

But on Tuesday night, she was at home on the phone when she suddenly fell ill. The person called 911 and paramedics broke down the door of her condo to reach her.

Her parents flew to Washington D.C. on Wednesday morning and headed to the hospital, where they were joined by Senator Kirk.

But on Wednesday, her mother shared the terrible news on Facebook.

'To
 all my friends: Late today, my beautiful middle daughter, Lisa Marie 
Radogno, was called home,' she wrote. 'Her death was sudden due to a massive 
pulmonary embolism.

'We knew the news was not good all day but the 
finality is beyond painful. Her Washington, D.C. 
friends have been fantastic. So great to see how much she was loved.'

Scene: Lisa Radogno was crossing this road near Capitol Hill last month when she was struck by a white Nissan

Tragic: She was on the phone when she fell ill last week and the person she was talking to contacted 911. Paramedics had to break down her door at her apartment, pictured, to get inside

Following her death, her colleagues also paid tribute to her as a great member of the team.

'She was the one who sat right outside of Senator Kirk's office, so she was the one who said, "Hey, it’s time to go, hey, we got to get moving",' Lance Trover, one of Radogno's co-workers, told NBC.

'She’s the person who kept the ball rolling.'
