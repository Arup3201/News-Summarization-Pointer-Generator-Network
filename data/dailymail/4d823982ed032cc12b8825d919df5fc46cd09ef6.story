A Year 2 boy dubbed 'devil child' and 'son of Satan' has caused a small group of angry parents to demand his removal from a small Catholic primary school

A Year 2 boy dubbed 'devil child' and 'son of Satan' has caused a small group of angry parents to demand his removal from a small Catholic primary school.

The  child reportedly 'explodes in rage, damages property and threatens staff', forcing  students to evacuate to another classroom located in the Brisbane primary school,The Sunday Mail reports. 

The Brisbane Catholic Education office has denied claims made against the boy, insisting the child has never been violent towards staff or students. 

'The claims that he has been violent towards students and staff is untrue - he does at time have angry responses', John Phelan, Communication Manager for Brisbane Catholic Education told Daily Mail Australia. 

'He is in fact quite popular with other students'. 

Mr Phelan insists there are only three parents  rallying for removal of the child.

He said two of the parents have children in the boy's year. 

'We need to be clear that it is three parents in the school who have gone off on this particular crusade,' he said.

The Brisbane school have allegedly met with the families involved and have attempted to talk through the issue without removing the Year 2 boy from the Catholic primary school.

'It is upsetting that these three parents believe the only outcome is the removal of the child'. 

It has been reported that parents have begun to pull  their children out from the Catholic school, in an attempt to avoid further disruption to their education.

Mr Phelan admits that a couple of families have left the school but does not know if it is in relation to the young boy's behaviour.

'It is important to note that there is absolutely no disruption within the class'.    

He said the terms 'devil child' and 'son of Satan' have never been heard by anyone from the school.

'The first time that anyone from the school has head the terminology was when they read it in the paper yesterday - it is completely new and incredibly childish and stupid', Mr Phelan said.

One parent aware of the boy's rage has opted to take the Catholic approach and has refused to participate in the protest

The young boy has gone through an 'extensive' assessment with a team of psychologists and paediatricians to determine how best to manage his outbursts. 

'He does not have any physical or mental impairment – his issue is behavioural.

'We have put in place a strategy which is currently working'. 

But parents insist  teachers have no control over the 'out of control' child. 

'He goes rogue... throws things', one parent said. 'When he was put in the principal's office he put holes in the wall. He's a devil child,' The Sunday Mail reports.  

Another parent aware of the boy's rage has opted to take the Catholic approach and has refused to participate in the protest.

'He does seem beyond control but this is a Catholic school and we have to support one another', he said.  

According to Kevin Bates, president of Queensland Teachers' Union, more teachers are now being forced to handle children with behavioural problems.

'The instances of this sort of behaviour coming to bear in a classroom have been on the increase and some principals just expect that teachers will put up with this sort of behaviour and just cope with it', Mr Bates said. 

Martin King, from Queensland Independent Education Union, told Daily Mail Australia that the principal has a duty of care to ensure the employees are safe in their work environment.

The young boy has gone through an 'extensive' assessment with a team of psychologists and paediatricians to determine how best to manage his outbursts. Experts have determined that the boy has behavioural issues
