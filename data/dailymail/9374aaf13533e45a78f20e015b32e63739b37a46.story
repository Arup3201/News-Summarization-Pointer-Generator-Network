England forward James Haskell has extended his contract with Wasps and will captain the Aviva Premiership side this season.

The 29-year-old came up through the youth ranks at Wasps, making his debut as an 18-year-old, and helped the club win the Heineken Cup and Premiership during a seven-year spell before moving abroad in 2009.

After stints in France, Japan and New Zealand, Haskell returned to Wasps two seasons ago.

Haskell, who had a year left on his existing contract, said: 'I'm really pleased to have extended my contract with Wasps and am honoured to have been asked to captain the club.

'Wasps is so much a part of my life, having played here for nine seasons in total. I have a lot to thank the club's coaches and support staff for, in helping me to get back into the England set up last season.

'I grew up supporting Wasps, which a lot of people don't realise. I have been a boyhood fan since I was 12. I had the privilege of learning from icons of the game here, like Lawrence Dallaglio, Joe Worsley and Paul Volley, and it is a huge privilege to now be in a position to lead the club.'

The 51-times capped England back rower takes over the captaincy from Chris Bell, who along with Matt Mullan has been named as vice-captain.

Wasps director of rugby Dai Young said: 'I am delighted that James has decided to extend his contract. It is an indication of the positive direction the club is moving in that players of his calibre and international experience are keen be a part of what we're working hard to build.'
