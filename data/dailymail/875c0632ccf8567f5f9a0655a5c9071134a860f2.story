As Tropical Storm Beryl moves across the Atlantic, tens of thousands of people were left without power as beach vacations and some Memorial Day remembrance services were drenched.

Though winds raged to 70mph soon after it hit, they later died down to about 35 mph, leading forecasters to downgrade the storm to a tropical depression and cancel all warnings and watches less than 11 hours after it made land in southern Georgia and northern Florida.

Joyce Connolly and her daughters left their home in Hurricane, West Virginia, to head south for a Memorial Day beach vacation — and ended up in the center of Tropical Storm Beryl.

While it left little damage after sweeping ashore with 70mph winds after midnight on Monday at Jacksonville, Florida, the storm still wrecked much of Connolly's trip.

She skipped a graduation because powerful winds kept her and her daughters from venturing past the beach boardwalk when the storm approached on Sunday.

And she postponed their drive home Monday as Beryl, downgraded to a tropical depression, continued to dump rain near the Georgia-Florida state line.

'It definitely changed our vacation to unfortunate circumstances that we're not happy with. But you just have to live with it,' said Connolly, who at least found the irony of her hometown's name 'pretty funny.'

Beach lifeguards turned swimmers away from the ocean because of dangerous rip currents from Jacksonville to Tybee Island, Georgia's largest public beach 140 miles to the north.

Skip Sasser, who oversees the island's lifeguards as its fire chief, said beach traffic was unusually thin for a holiday. The ocean was declared off-limits to swimmers for a second day in a row.

'It's been raining intermittently, so it's chased a lot of them off,' Sasser said. 'There was a lot of traffic this morning heading westbound out of Tybee.'

Veterans groups, meanwhile, carried out outdoor Memorial Day ceremonies despite the grim forecast.

At Savannah's historic Bonaventure Cemetery, American Legion members worked through a downpour to make sure its plot for veterans had a small American flag planted by each headstone.

'When we were setting up, I had a different shirt on and I got soaked to the skin. My socks and my underwear probably are, too,' said Jim Grismer, commander of American Legion Post 135 in Savannah.

'I had so many people trying to talk me into moving it inside. But I said then you can't have the live firing salute and the flag raising.'

Aside from ruining holiday plans, the rain was welcome on the Georgia coast for bringing some relief from persistent drought.

According to the state climatologist's office, as of May 1, rainfall in Savannah was 15 inches below normal for the past 12 months.

Emergency officials said minor flooding was reported near the coast, but the ground was quickly soaking up the water. And the winds had died down considerably.

'We've needed it for a long time,' said Ray Parker, emergency management director for coastal McIntosh County south of Savannah, who said the worst damage came by trees falling on two homes overnight.

'We were lucky that we didn't get 3 to 4 inches in 30 minutes. Most of it soaked right in before it had a chance to run off. It fell on an empty sponge.'

The rainfall stopped in Savannah and other northern parts of the Georgia coast on Monday afternoon, but more was expected through Tuesday.

A frontal system moving south from the Great Lakes is expected to cause the storm do a U-turn and push it back out to sea.

According to NBC News, Beryl is the strongest May tropical cyclone to hit the U.S. since a hurricane hit the Outer Banks of North Carolina with winds of 75 mph on May 29, 1908.

The National Hurricane Center in Miami reported that the center of Beryl made landfall near Jacksonville Beach at around 12.10am with reports that the weather system was in the process of making landfall.

'There are strong rain bands that are rotating around the center of the storm,' forecaster Al Sandrik said in an audio statement on the NHC website.

At 8pm last night, Beryl was packing sustained winds near 70 miles per hour and located about 75 miles east of Jacksonville, Florida, the hurricane center said.

An increase in wind speeds to 74 miles per hour or more would make it a Category 1 hurricane on the five-step Saffir-Simpson intensity scale.

Beach-goers and campers already had their Memorial Day weekend plans ruined as they were forced to pack up and leave the coastline to go inland.

A tropical storm warning remained in effect early today for coastal areas from Flagler Beach, Florida to Edisto Beach, South Carolina, according to MSNBC.

But the storm is forecast to weaken throughout today and tomorrow as winds die down.

'We're seeing about the best that Beryl has right now as far as its winds are concerned, with winds about 70 mph,' forecaster Al Sandrik told the station. 'The model shows significant weakening of the storm in 12 hours.'

Other forecasters said the storm surge and high tide could bring up to four feet of flooding in northeastern Florida and Georgia.

The storm's approach led some vacationers in Georgia to leave early, said Alden Alias, the front desk manager at The King and Prince Hotel on St Simons Island, a popular coastal resort town.

'The waves are pretty big,' she said. 'The winds are starting to pick up.'

City officials in Jacksonville canceled Memorial Day ceremonies scheduled for Monday and closed some local parks as the storm drew closer. "I am encouraging all area residents to stay indoors and off the streets as the storm hits," said Jacksonville Mayor Alvin Brown.

'A three-day thunderstorm is what it's probably going to be,' said Jay Wiggins, emergency management director for Glynn County, which is about 60 miles south of Savannah and includes Brunswick and St. Simons Island in Georgia. 'Unfortunately, it's going to ruin a lot of Memorial Day plans.'

Wiggins said he expects some flooded roadways and scattered power outages, perhaps some minor flooding in waterfront homes, but otherwise little damage. However, he urged beachgoers to beware of dangerous rip currents.

Computer forecast models show Beryl moving on an eventual path back out over the Atlantic after coming ashore, posing no threat to U.S. oil and gas installations in the Gulf of Mexico.

The storm is forecast to dump as much as 4 to 8 inches of rain, with as much as 12 inches in some areas, and threatens rip currents and possible coastal flooding, the hurricane center said.

Beryl formed off the South Carolina coast late on Friday as a subtropical storm, a reference to the storm's structure. Subtropical storms usually have a broader wind field than tropical storms and shower and thunderstorm activity farther removed from the storm's center.

It was reclassified as a tropical storm on Sunday.

Beryl followed the season's first major storm, Tropical Storm Alberto, which was the earliest-forming Atlantic storm since 2003.

The Atlantic hurricane season officially runs from June 1 to November 30.

While Georgia hasn't taken a direct hit from a major hurricane in 114 years, the last time a tropical storm made landfall here was in August 1988. Tropical Storm Chris hit near Savannah but did little damage as it pushed northward into South Carolina.

In South Carolina, Beaufort County Emergency Management deputy director David Zeoli said Saturday that word went out to first-responders along the coast near the Georgia line to pay attention to the storm's progress.

On Saturday, the East Coast experienced air travel chaos as a heavy thunderstorm caused Newark International Airport In New Jersey and Logan International Airport in Boston to close for a time to incoming traffic, leaving thousands delayed on Memorial weekend.

The cause was a powerful thunderstorm which was raging across the north eastern coast, with Philadelphia International Airport also experiencing departure delays of anywhere up to 45 minutes.

The storm caused even more problems as it moved over the New York City area with La Guardia International and JFK International Airport  reporting minimum departure delays of 15 minutes, with the storm passing over early Saturday evening.
