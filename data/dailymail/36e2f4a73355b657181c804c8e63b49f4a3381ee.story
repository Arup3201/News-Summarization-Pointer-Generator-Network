Politicians descending on Charlotte for the Democratic National Convention will be greeted by not one, but two highly-controversial billboards aimed at religion.

The American Atheists, a non-profit organization that promotes the 'absolute separation of government and religion,' has put up two advertisements slamming both Christianity and Mormonism.

One that attack's Mitt Romney's religion reads 'Big Money, Big Bigotry' while the other claims Christianity 'Promotes Hate, Calls it "Love."

The group tried to get the same ads placed in Tampa for the Republican National Convention, but local companies refused to post them and called them 'attack ads.'

Conversation: Politicians descending on Charlotte for the Democratic National Convention will be greeted by not one, but two highly-controversial billboards aimed at religion

Agenda: The American Atheists, a non-profit organization that promotes the 'absolute separation of government and religion,' has put up two advertisements slamming both Christianity and Mormonism

The American Atheists say that the signs are meant to 'expose the foolishness' of religion in the political landscape.

They hope that by targeting these two religions, they can push faith out of politics.

'The election of our leaders in the United States is one of the most important decisions that we as citizens make. Allowing our judgment to be clouded by sheer silliness is unacceptable,' David Silverman, president of the American Atheists, said in a statement.

'We want to show the people of our country the foolishness of mixing religion with politics.'

One sign which hovers above the Brookshire Freeway reads 'Mormonism: Magic Underwear, Baptizes Dead People, Big Money, Big Bigotry.'

A photograph of a giddy, luminescent man in his underwear is pictured alongside the message.

A different version of the ad opens with 'God Is A Space Alien.'

The second sign is located above Wilkinson Boulevard and reads 'Christianity: Sadistic God; Useless Savior, 30,000+ Versions of "Truth," Promotes Hate, Calls it "Love."'

A photograph of Jesus on a slice of toasted bread accompanies this message.

Both advertisements then say 'Atheism: Simply reasonable. Join American Atheists!'

'Our great country was founded on the secular ideals of the Constitution. Allowing religion to be the litmus test of our candidates undermines the very core of our freedoms,' Teresa MacBain of the group said.

'Article VI of the Constitution states, "no religious test shall ever be required as a qualification" for those desiring public office. How can we disregard our governing principles so blatantly?'

The two billboards, which cost $15,000, will be up for the next two months. The DNC is taking place from September 3-6.

Rejected: Jim Cullinan, the spokesperson of Clear Channel Outdoor in Tampa, said his company was willing to work with the American Atheists but that their latest campaign was not appropriate

The company that owns the billboards backed the signage.

'The upcoming Democratic National Convention will bring to Charlotte people of varying viewpoints and a diversity of opinion. The ability to express one's opinion is a right and a privilege at the core of a democratic society,' they said in a statement to the Charlotte News Observer.

Billboard companies in Florida did not feel the same way.

'When their creative simply asks questions, that's suitable, but when they issue attacks, those are not.'

American Atheists said that they were refused by every advertising company they approached about the billboards in Tampa, the city which will be hosting the Republican National Convention.

Jim Cullinan, the spokesperson of Clear Channel Outdoor, said his company was willing to work with the American Atheists but that their latest campaign was not appropriate.

'We worked with them before, but we don't post attack ads,' Mr Cullinan said to the MailOnline.

He said the company asked the Atheists if they were willing to work on a similar ad that was not as inflammatory.

'When their creative simply asks questions, that's suitable, but when they issue attacks, those are not. That's simply our policy for our billboards.'

Clear Channel Outdoor's former corporate sibling, Clear Channel Radio, has close ties to firebrands Rush Limbaugh, Glenn Back and Sean Hannity, but the billboard company says it's not interested in playing politics.
