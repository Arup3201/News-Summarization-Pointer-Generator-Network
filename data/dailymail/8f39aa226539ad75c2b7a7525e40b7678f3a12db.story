Peter Scudamore believes it is no forgone conclusion that Ruby Walsh will abandon Hurricane Fly to ride Willie Mullins-trained stablemate and favourite Faugheen in the Champion Hurdle on March 10.

Most bookmakers and pundits expect Walsh to pick the unbeaten younger horse despite Hurricane Fly, a dual Champion Hurdler, landing an historic fifth Irish Champion Hurdle at Leopardstown on Sunday to take his Grade-One race tally to 22.

Eight-time champion jockey Scudamore said: ‘With a horse as good as Hurricane Fly, it will be a tough decision.

Walsh has been tipped to abandon Hurricane Fly at Cheltenham for the younger unbeaten horse Faugheen 

‘Even for a hard-nosed sportsman, sentiment does come into it. It has to be there. In the past, Ruby stuck with Kauto Star when he could have ridden Denman.

‘Ground is also big factor. Hurricane Fly wants it soft and, with Cheltenham is as early in the year as it can be, there could be a chance the ground will be softer. That could swing the decision towards Hurricane Fly.

‘Faugheen still has to prove himself at the highest level over two miles. On his bare form, including his win in the Christmas Hurdle at Kempton, he is too short a price for what he has achieved.’

Walsh, successful 17 times on Hurricane Fly, has partnered the 11-year-old in his last 18 races, a sequence stretching back to his 2011 Champion Hurdle win.

Coral, who have Faugheen as Evens favourite for the Champion Hurdle, yesterday trimmed Hurricane Fly’s odds to 8-1.

Meanwhile, trainer Gary Moore has successfully put his reigning two-mile chaser Sire De Grugy through his first jumping session since he sustained a hip injury that prevented his return to action in November.

Sire De Grugy is being prepared to run in the Game Spirit Chase at Newbury on February 7.

Enda Bolger-trained Gilgamboa, who lost his unbeaten novice chase record when slammed by Un De Sceaux in the two-mile Arkle Chase at Leopardstown on Sunday, is set for a step up in trip.
