Former Manchester United first-team coach Rene Meulensteen has some words of warning for the players as they meet his Dutch compatriot Louis van Gaal for the first time on Wednesday.

The 62-year-old has clashed with some star names during his previous spells in charge at Barcelona and Bayern Munich, and won't be afraid to bruise a few egos at Old Trafford to get what he wants, according to Meulensteen.

He said: 'Louis has got his own management style, which has thrown up a few difficulties along the way wherever he's been, Barcelona or Bayern Munich because of the way that he is, the way he puts himself in front of players.

'Players accept it or players sometimes don't. If they don't accept it, then yeah you probably have a problem.

'They've had Sir Alex Ferguson and they've had a disastrous season with David Moyes, now another one comes in, so that will take time.

'United at this moment in time, will be seen by the opposition still a team that can be beaten unless proven otherwise.'
