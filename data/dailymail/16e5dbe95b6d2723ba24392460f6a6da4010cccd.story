In the past 30 days, more than 1,400 earthquakes have struck globally - and at least 160 of them have rocked the US across Oklahoma and the west coast. 

The US government is working with a number of experts to develop an early warning system to give residents a heads up about such natural disasters as quickly as possible. 

And one firm, called Early Warning Labs, is developing a service called QuakeAlert that monitors quakes and shaking using a smartphone app.

The California-based startup's system includes an app, alongside a series of in-home or office alarms that sound an emergency tone as soon as possible, before the shaking reaches that particular location.

The system also plays a countdown to warn the homeowner, or office worker, when the shaking will reach them, and reveals how intense it will be - ranging from light to severe.

Additionally, the app includes tips on what to do if the user is indoors, outdoors, or in a moving vehicle.

The app works as a standalone product, meaning that if an earthquake hits while a user is out of the house or office, they are still sent a warning. It does this using the phone’s in-built sensors. 

The firm developed the technology in partnership with mapping provider ESRI, as well as the US Government.

Its mission is to ‘improve, expand, and lower the costs of the existing earthquake early warning systems.’

The work is part of a larger project set up by the United States Geological Survey (USGS) to develop an earthquake early warning system (EEW) for the country - dubbed USGS Earthquake Hazards Program.

Early Warning Labs is developing a system called QuakeAlert that monitors quakes and shaking using a smartphone app and sensors built into physical alarms. It is hoped it will reduce the amount of damage caused by natural disasters in the US. The aftermath of the 1994 Northridge earthquake is pictured

A demonstration earthquake early warning system called ShakeAlert began sending test notifications to selected users in January 2012.

But, EWL said the system needs to be further tested, and additional funding is needed to complete the final research and development of the system.

The point of an earthquake early warning system is to ‘rapidly detect the initiation of an earthquake, estimate the level of ground shaking intensity to be expected, and issue a warning before significant ground shaking starts’ explained EWL.

A network of seismic sensors detect the first energy to radiate from an earthquake, known as the P-wave energy, as well as the location and the magnitude of the earthquake.

Then, the system estimates how far and wide the ground shaking will spread.

The system provides a second warning before the so-called S-wave arrives, which brings the strong shaking that typically causes most of the damage.

Warnings are sent to local and state public emergency response officials, critical infrastructure, private businesses, and the public.

EEW systems have already been successfully implemented in Japan, Taiwan, Mexico, and other nations with varying degrees of sophistication and coverage.

And the California startup is hoping to develop and release the system over the next three years.

It admits that, while the system may only provide a few seconds warning, depending on their distance from the centre, the system still gives people enough time to get to safety.

The developers added that this also gives officials time to disable gas lines and manage transport links, for example.

The app will be free, but the alarms are set to cost $100 (£60) each.
