Companies behind nuisance calls and texts will be fined up to £500,000 under a crackdown on firms which plague millions of families.

Ministers will announce today that they will change the law to making it much easier to levy tough penalties on those responsible for the menace, MailOnline has learned.

The communications watchdog will no longer have to prove messages are causing a 'substantial damage or substantial distress' before taking action against those responsible, including holding bosses personally liable for fines.

Ministers will announce tomorrow that they will change the law to making it much easier to levy tough penalties on those responsible for the menace 

Last year there were more than 175,000 complaints made to the Information Commissioner's Office about nuisance calls and texts.

Four in five people are regularly cold-called at home, according to consumer group Which?, while a third of people feel intimidated by the messages. 

Spam text messaging is also on the increase, particularly communications about debt or accident claims. Industry figures show there are one billion unwanted phone and text messages a year.

Some firms are believed to have illegally obtained mobile and landline numbers. Others are operating outright scams.

Culture Secretary Sajid Javid vowed to act after seeing evidence that so many people were suffering cold calls that six in ten people said they no longer want to answer their own phone.

A consultation was launched in October last year on lowering the threshold for legal action.

It is understood that ministers will announce tomorrow that they will go ahead with the change, to make it easier to take action against firms behind nuisance calls.

Legislation is expected to be amended shortly with the change coming into effect before the general election.

A government source told MailOnline said: 'Companies have bombarded people with unwanted marketing calls and texts, but have escaped punishment because they did not cause enough harm.

'So we're making it easier for companies to face the consequences of ignoring the law and subjecting us to calls or texts we have said we don't want.'

The ICO had levied a fine of £300,000 against the co-owner of a marketing company, Tetrus Telecoms, which sent hundreds of thousands of texts about PPI and accident claims.

But a tribunal upheld Christopher Niebel's appeal that the messages did not meet the legal test to prove 'substantial harm or distress' had been caused. 

Ed Vaizey, Tory digital minister, said: 'For far too long companies have bombarded people with unwanted marketing calls and texts and escaped punishment because they did not cause enough harm.

'This change will make it easier for the Information Commissioner's Office to take action against offenders and send a clear message to others that harassing consumers with nuisance calls or texts is just not on.

'We're also going to look at whether the powers the ICO have to hold to account board level executives are sufficient.'

According to new research from alldayPA, which handles calls for 23,000 small businesses, some companies are being targeted with as many as 30 cold calls a day. 

David Joseph, board executive at alldayPA said: 'The number of cold-callers targeting businesses is out of control and has become a real drain on the time and resources especially for smaller companies and home businesses.'

Earlier this month Information Commissioner Christopher Graham demanded more powers to rein in firms that bombard pensioners and Alzheimer's sufferers with nuisance text messages and cold calls..

He urged ministers to change the law to make it easier to clamp down on unwanted calls and spam texts by companies promising to write off debts, pursue compensation and sell anything from mobile phones to double glazing. 

Mr Graham said: 'The current rules around marketing calls are a licence for spammers and scammers.

'The elderly and vulnerable are particularly at risk, and this can only add to the worries of those who care for them. The Government is letting people down.

'Time and time again the Government talks about changing the law and clamping down on this problem, but so far it's just that – talk. We seem to be going round in circles. The Government need to lay the order, change the law and bring in a reform that would make a real difference.' 

Ministers insist they are determined to tackle the problem of nuisance calls. Rules on data sharing were changed last year to make it easier for Ofcom to give information to the ICO on companies breaking the law. 

The ICO has powers to take action against companies who break the existing rules on direct marketing. 

Since January 2012, the watchdog has taken enforcement action against nine companies for nuisance calls and text messages, hitting them with fines totalling £815,000. 

The ICO states: 'We meet with companies to discuss their compliance with the law and monitor their progress. And we now have the power to fine those who break the law.' 

Separately, Ofcom has powers to deal with abandoned and silent calls by taking action against offenders that persistently misuse a network or service resulting in annoyance, inconvenience or anxiety. 

To date Ofcom has fined seven companies totalling £1,926,500 for abandoned and silent calls.

Mr Javid said in October: 'Companies have bombarded people with unwanted marketing calls and texts, but have escaped punishment because they did not cause enough harm,' the Culture Secretary said.

'Being called day after day may not be 'substantially distressing', but that doesn't make it acceptable.

'I want to make it easier for companies to face the consequences of ignoring the law and subjecting us to calls or texts we have said we don't want.'

Consumer group Which? welcomed the announcement today. Executive director Richard Lloyd, who chaired the Nuisance Calls Task Force, said: 'These calls are an everyday menace blighting the lives of millions so we want the regulator to send a clear message by using their new powers to full effect without delay. 

'It's also good news that the Government has listened to our call and is looking into how senior executives can be held to account if their company makes nuisance calls.

'The regulator can now go after the worst offenders for flouting cold-calling rules: just one more nuisance call could see those companies facing a big fine.' 

Two companies that appeared in the BBC TV series The Call Centre, starring eccentric boss Neville Wilshire, were fined £225,000 for nuisance payment protection insurance calls in 2013.

Separately, communications regulator Ofcom has the power to deal with silent calls by taking action against firms that persistently misuse a network or service resulting in 'annoyance, inconvenience or anxiety'. To date, it has fined seven companies a combined £1,618,000.

However, watchdogs have complained the law as it stands makes prosecutions and fines difficult.

The ICO levied a fine of £300,000 against one firm but the decision was reversed on appeal as no substantial harm or distress had been shown. The watchdog warned the ruling had left it almost powerless to deter such companies even if they churn out industrial quantities of messages.
