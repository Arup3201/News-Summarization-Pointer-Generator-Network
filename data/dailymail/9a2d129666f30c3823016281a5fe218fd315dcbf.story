A nine-year-old girl who reportedly was found stuffed in a refrigerator on Monday had been dead since January, investigators said today.

Ayahana Comb, who suffered from cerebral palsy, weighed just 14lbs when she was discovered at the Happy Home Apartments in Houston, Texas. 

A neighbor, who was concerned that he hadn't seen the little girl in a few months, went to check on the apartment earlier this week. He found the front door unlocked and no one at home, so went inside and discovered the little girl's body wrapped in a blanket in a refrigerator drawer.

The little girl's mother Amber Keys told police that her daughter stopped breathing one night in January and that she could not resuscitate her. The mother said she did not know what to do with the body. She has not been charged

Firefighters who responded to 911 calls on Monday declared the nine-year-old dead at the scene. An autopsy is being conducted to determine the cause of death.

The little girl's condition required that she use a wheelchair and was bottle fed.

According to KHOU, her mother Amber Keys told police that her daughter stopped breathing one night in January and although she tried CPR, she was unable to save her.

Miss Keys said that she didn't know what to do with her daughter's body. She turned herself over to authorities on Tuesday and has not been charged.

Ayahana's five-year-old sister is now in the care of social services. A custody hearing has been scheduled so that the girl can be placed with a family member.

Estella Olguin, a spokeswoman with Child Protective Services, told Chron.com that CPS had no previous contact with the family.

Kathi Combs, the girl's grandmother, told KHOU: 'It's devastating to everyone. We loved her. All loved her.'

The girl's father Armand Comb said that he had no idea his daughter was dead and claimed to have seen her just two months ago

The girl's father Armand Comb told KHOU that his daughter suffered from cerebral palsy and even though she couldn't communicate or walk, she was always happy. 

Mr Comb claimed that he last saw his daughter two months ago and she appeared to be in good health.

He said that he last spoke to his ex-girlfriend Miss Keys on Monday and that she gave him the impression that everything with Ayahana was fine.

Mr Comb said: 'She was talking like she was there with them.'

MailOnline was awaiting a response from the Houston Police Department.
