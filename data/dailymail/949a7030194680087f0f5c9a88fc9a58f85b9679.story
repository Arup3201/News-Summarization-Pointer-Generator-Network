A 19-year-old missing woman who was the prime suspect of a homicide investigation into the death of her 52-year-old pizza shop boss in Kansas has been located in Florida and charged with his first-degree murder.

Sarah Brooke Gonzales McLinn had been living with her boss, Harold M. Sasko - the owner of three Cici's pizza restaurant franchises in Kansas - at his home in Lawrence, near Topeka.

She is now facing the death penalty, with court documents alleging she acted with premeditation in killing Sasko, whose body was found beaten to death at the home they shared on January 19.

Sasko's ex-girlfriend, Kimberly Qualls, told PEOPLE she was dating him when, in 2012, Sasko told her McLinn was coming to stay with him so he could help her with drug problems and get her away from friends in gangs.

Charged: Sarah Brooke Gonzales McLinn, 19, is accused of killing her boss and housemate, Harold Sasko, who owned and ran three pizza shops in Topeka, Kansas. She had been missing for six days before police found and arrested her in Florida

Victim: Harold M. Sasko, 52, was found beaten to death with 'an edged instrument' at his home in Lawrence, Kansas, which he shared with 19-year-old employee Sarah McLinn. Police he had been subdued before his death

Scene: The body of Harold Sasko was found here, at his house in Lawrence, Kansas, on January 19. His car and housemate were missing

Qualls told the magazine Sasko was a spiritual man who 'liked to help people' and that she feared something bad would come of the situation.

Police say Sasko had been subdued and was unconscious when he was killed.

While details of the death remain unclear, police have said the murder weapon was 'an edged instrument'.

'Based upon our investigation, evidence suggests Ms. McLinn gained control over Mr. Sasko and then killed him,' court documents obtained by KCTV allege.

Sasko's body was discovered after police went to his house looking for McLinn, whose family had reported her missing when she failed to make a meeting with her sister, Ashley.

Sasko's car was missing but McLinn's was at the house.

A search then started for McLinn, with authorities initially saying they did not whether she was a victim or a suspect in the crime.

It wasn't until Saturday, January 25, six days after the murder, that she was found inside Sasko's 2008 Nissan Altima in Florida.

A federal park ranger noticed the car parked at a campground in Everglade National Park in Dade County, some 1,560 miles from the crime scene.

After running the plates, he realized the vehicle was linked to a murder case and called for back up.

McLinn was arrested without incident.

She was found in possession of a controlled substance, police said.

Authorities believe that McLinn was living in Sasko's car at the park.

McLinn was believed to be alone but Sasko's dog, Oliver, was with her in the car.

Authorities in Dade County dropped the drug charge and the first-degree murder charge was filed in Douglas County on Sunday.

An extradition hearing for McLinn has yet to be scheduled.

If she waives extradition, she could be back in Kansas by next week.

McLinn's family had said they feared her safety and believed she was a victim.

They had sought her safe return.
