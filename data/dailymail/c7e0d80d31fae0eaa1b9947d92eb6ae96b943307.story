A Marine veteran’s death had left his widow with an uncertain financial future and just a room in her parents’ house to sleep in with her young son.

But Sara Wood, of Brazoria County, Texas, has been thrown a lifeline after she found out she will soon receive her own mortgage-free house.

The donated gift was revealed to a roaring crowd at a Houston Texans NFL game and left Mrs Wood’s son Landon hugging his emotional mother.

Widowed mother: Sara Wood, left, of Brazoria County, Texas, found out she will soon receive her own mortgage-free house with her son Landon, right

‘I’m amazed and shocked and honoured,’ Mrs Wood told Your Houston News. ‘So many people are coming together in Scott’s honour.’

Iraq veteran Scott Wood died last month aged 35 from complications after injuries sustained in combat abroad, reported Fox Sports Houston.

Staff Sergeant Wood was a big Texans fan and was even buried wearing a jersey with wide-receiver Andre Johnson’s name printed on.

Mrs Wood and Landon were invited to Sunday’s game and told they would be shown on a big screen and the boy would get Christmas presents.

But then they were also told they were 
going to get a custom-built house in Alvin, Texas - and Mrs Wood will 
have some design input.

‘Now being able to stay in Alvin and having a home in Alvin, we'll be close,’ Mrs Wood told Fox Sports Houston.  ‘That's what Landon needs.’

The house will come from Operation Finally Home, a charity started in 2005 by builder Dan Wallrath to help veterans and their families.

‘It's such a joy to see the looks on their face when they know they're getting a mortgage-free home that nobody can take away,’ he told Fox Sports Houston.

Operation Finally Home has given away 32 homes so far. Mr Wallrath had called Texans owner Bob McNair to set up the announcement.

The project gets donated materials and land, then Mr Wallrath offers his own company’s labour for free to disabled veterans and families.

'He knows daddy's in heaven. I don't know if he fully comprehends what that means. He knows daddy's
not coming back'

Sara Wood

Mother and son are expected to move into the new house by May. As the surprise was announced at the NFL stadium her eyes filled with tears.

‘He's always been very sensitive,’ Mrs Wood told Fox Sports Houston of her son. ‘When I start crying, he automatically… for mommy.’

‘He knows daddy's in heaven,’ she added. ‘I don't know if he fully comprehends what that means. He knows daddy's not coming back.’
