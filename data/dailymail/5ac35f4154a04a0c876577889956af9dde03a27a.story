Prof Bamforth said beer, particularly real ale, contains many nutrients that are important for a healthy body

Those who went on the wagon in January, giving up alcohol in a determined attempt to detox their body, may have done more harm than good.

An American academic claims that drinking regularly, but in moderation, is more likely to ensure a healthy body than simply giving up.

The claims come from Professor Charles Bamforth of the University of California, Davis and author of Beer, Health and Nutrition.

The professor said it is well understood that drinking to excess can cause serious health problems, but he argues people should not assume that going without completely is healthy.

‘Many people don’t realise that drinking in moderation has significant health benefits and that moderate drinkers have a longer life expectancy than non – drinkers,’ he said.

‘Regular moderate intake of alcohol is good for the heart and blood circulation.’

He added: ‘The key is a little and often.

'You are seriously mistaken if you think that having a month without drinking will protect you from the effects of excessive drinking for the rest of the year.

'The best advice is to drink moderately throughout the year.’

Prof Bamforth said beer, particularly real ale, contains many nutrients that are important for a healthy body.

He
 said: ‘The great thing about beer is that it is low in alcohol and 
brewed from natural raw materials so it’s a good source of important 
nutrients such as antioxidants, B vitamins and dietary silicon that 
promotes strong bones. Indeed beer used to be known as liquid bread.’

Britain’s Campaign for Real Ale welcomed his comments, suggesting older people could see particular benefits.

Chairman, Colin Valentine, said: ’The health benefits of moderate drinking may explain why you meet so many people enjoying a healthy retirement who still like going for a pint of real ale in their local.

‘The evidence also shows that sociability has significant benefits to health and well-being.  You are far better off sharing a beer with friends in a pub than sitting at home drinking by yourself.’
