These adorable pictures show two kittens being nursed back to health with the help of babies' socks after being found minutes from death.

The kittens, George and Elton, were found abandoned in a shed in Osterley, west London two weeks ago, severely malnourished and only a couple of weeks old.

Thankfully they are now on the road to recovery - partly thanks to a pair of babies' socks and some clever thinking.

Kittens George and Elton were found abandoned in a shed on August 1, just minutes from death

They wear babies' socks to keep them warm and to stop them from hurting each other - but there is only so much the vets can do to stop the cute cats from play-fighting

Since their rescue by RSPCA officers, the playful pair have been hand-reared by vet nurse Katrina Devita, who put them in the blue and white socks to keep them warm and to stop them from hurting each other.

Ms Devita, based at the RSPCA's animal hospital in Putney, south-west London, has to hand-feed them every two hours, and give them lots of love and attention.

Centre manager Sian Anderson said: 'You may wonder about the outfits.

'Unfortunately these two naughty boys have a habit of suckling each other in their sleep and making themselves sore.

'Our nurse came up with these fabulous outfits to help stop the habit.

'They are made from baby socks as they really are that small. As you can see they are very happy and not affected by them.'

The kittens will be re-homed in a month, but vets will make sure the inseparable pair go to the same owner

Despite the vets' best efforts to stop the kittens from playing with each other, George and Elton are almost inseparable.

George and Elton will be available for re-homing in around a month once they are fully weaned, but will have to be kept together because they are so close.

Ms Anderson said: 'We are seeing such a high number of kittens coming into our care, and we would like to urge people to remember to get their cats neutered to try and avoid unwanted litters of kittens.

'Hand-rearing is so time intensive and our staff are overwhelmed by the sheer number of cats and kittens that need our help.'

The RSPCA is urging people to adopt a kitten rather than buy one because of a surge in abandoned and neglected cats so far this year.

The charity has taken 14 per cent more poorly cared for cats this year than last, and has rescued 3,306 abandoned cats so far in 2014.  

Ms Anderson said: 'We are seeing such a high number of kittens coming into our care, and we would like to urge people to remember to get their cats neutered to try and avoid unwanted litters of kittens.

'Hand-rearing is so time-intensive and our staff are overwhelmed by the sheer number of cats and kittens that need our help.'
