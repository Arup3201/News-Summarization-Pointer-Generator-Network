A girl of 
two who was given a chance to take her first steps after generous Daily 
Mail readers raised more than £50,000 for life-changing surgery has been
 turned down for the operation in the UK.

The
 family of cerebral palsy sufferer Sophie Thomlinson were told to find 
money for an operation to enable her to walk after she was denied NHS 
funding.

Despite
 raising the cash, the family has been devastated by news that Leeds 
General Infirmary will not operate because Sophie’s condition is ‘not 
severe enough yet’.

Allison Thomlinson raised £50,000 for Sophie to have surgery which she believed would help her walk. But, she was then devastated to be told Sophie does not qualify for surgery

A girl of 
two who was given a chance to take her first steps after generous Daily 
Mail readers raised more than £50,000 for life-changing surgery has been
 turned down for the operation in the UK.

The
 family of cerebral palsy sufferer Sophie Thomlinson were told to find 
money for an operation to enable her to walk after she was denied NHS 
funding.

Despite
 raising the cash, the family has been devastated by news that Leeds 
General Infirmary will not operate because Sophie’s condition is ‘not 
severe enough yet’.

The
 hospital is within the same NHS Trust that last year provided breast 
enlargement surgery at taxpayers’ expense to an aspiring glamour model 
who claimed her small breasts ‘ruined her life’.

Now
 the Thomlinsons face paying £75,000 to take Sophie abroad for selective
 dorsal rhizotomy – an operation on the lower spine to improve mobility.

Mrs Thomlinson says she is particularly upset because so many people donated to help pay for the operation

Doctors at Leeds General Infirmary have told Mrs Thomlinson that Sophie does not need the operation and that it would not be in her best interests for it to be carried out

Selective Dorsal Rhizotomy is a neurosurgical technique used to treat spasticity (increased muscle tone) in the lower limbs.

The lower vertebrae are opened to reveal the spinal cord which contains the neurones of the central nervous system.

These neurones (bundles of nerve fibres) channel messages between the brain and different areas of the body.

Electrical stimulation is used to identify and sub-divide sensory and motor nerves.

This process continues until the specific nerves and nerve roots affecting the spastic muscles are identified and cut.

Due to the size of the nerves and rootlets, this is a very precise procedure and therefore the surgery can last several hours and requires a general anaesthetic.

Many months of physiotherapy are needed after the surgery to retrain the legs.

Yesterday Sophie’s mother Allison, 40, said she was ‘bitterly disappointed’ at the decision.

‘We
 knew we had to have an assessment before the operation but we were told
 she had all the right characteristics – we just had to raise the 
money,’ Mrs Thomlinson said.

‘Now, thanks to everyone who has donated, we have the money – so it was such a blow to be told no. 
On paper everything said she was an ideal candidate for the surgery, but
 when they saw her they said she wasn’t severe enough yet.'

'You
 think, ''She can’t walk, how severe do you have to be?' I was so upset 
and angry I just couldn’t speak because I knew I would cry. It is so 
frustrating to think of the girl who had the boob job.

Sophie,
 from Dukinfield, near Manchester, was born prematurely and has a form 
of cerebral palsy called spastic diplegia. She suffers painful spasms in
 her legs and cannot stand unsupported.

She
 shuffles around on her knees, which causes bruising and means she 
cannot play with her friends. Her mother said: ‘It hurts me so much when
 we go out to the park and she sees people running around. She wants to 
join in but she has to just sit there waving.’ 

Doctors said surgery would not benefit Sophie now. They advised the family to return in a year to see if her condition worsens.

Mrs Thomlinson has now been told that Sophie will be reassessed in a year's time

Mrs Thomlinson remains convinced Sophie should have the operation and is angry that she is being denied it even though the NHS does not need to pay for it

A
 spokesman for Leeds Teaching Hospitals Trust said: ‘We would only 
recommend undergoing surgery if the complex range of tests we carry out 
showed there would be a benefit.’

But
 Mrs Thomlinson and her husband Craig, 44, are worried Sophie would only
 be deferred again next year, so she will now be assessed by Dr Tae 
Park, the American surgeon who pioneered the procedure.

If
 he agrees to perform the operation, they hope to fly to St Louis 
Children’s Hospital in Missouri when Sophie is three. With intensive 
physiotherapy, she could be walking by five.

But it means the couple must raise another £22,000 to cover the added costs of surgery in the US.
