Over a glittering football career, Phil Neville won six Premier League titles with Manchester United and won 59 caps for England.

Yet despite a lifetime of sporting achievements that would be the envy of anyone, the 37-year-old football ace-turned-pundit has been forced to admit he never learned to make a cup of instant coffee.

Neville sensationally revealed he was caught out by Daily Mail sports journalist who came to his house just before Christmas for an interview.

How much milk? Phil Neville sits in the living room where he received SportsMail journalist Matt Lawton - and served coffee for the first time in his life - after first phoning his wife to ask her how the hot drink is made

He told listeners on BBC radio how he panicked after asking Matt Lawton if he would like a drink.

'When he replied coffee, my heart sank because I thought: "how do I do that?",' Neville was quoted as saying by the Telegraph. 'I ran into the kitchen and I thought I am not going to poison this guy so I rang my wife.

'The problem I then had was how much milk to put in. I forgot to ask my wife how much.

'To be fair, he [the journalist] is still alive.'

Mr Lawton's feature interview revealed how he sat in the football star's living room at 11.30am on a Monday morning and the former player told him he had just made coffee for the first time in his life.

Mr Lawton told MailOnline today that the hot drink was up to scratch. He said: 'For a first attempt it was very good, but I had no idea he was in the kitchen ringing his wife for instructions.'

Elsewhere in Neville's extensive chat with Mr Lawton, the former player told how legendary cricket pundit Geoffrey Boycott helped him improve his commentating skills after his attempts during the World Cup led to complaints to the BBC.

Glittering career: Neville won six Premier League titles with Manchester United and won 59 caps for England, but apparently failed to pick up everyday life skills such as how to make a hot drink for his guests

‘After I got back from Brazil I went to the cricket to do a Test Match Special with Jonathan Agnew,’ said Neville. ‘And Geoff Boycott was there. “Come ‘ere son,” he says, and for the next hour he took me into all the different broadcasting boxes and introduced me to everyone. And then we sat down and talked and, without really knowing it, he gave me an hour’s masterclass on commentary and working in the media.

‘”What you need to do lad is get on that radio,” he says. I started laughing. I thought he was trying to tell me I had a face for radio.

‘But he said, “Find your voice, get your confidence”. And he made the point that it’s that bit easier to make a mistake on the radio, because if you describe something wrong the guy driving down the M6 won’t know. There’s a bit more of a safety net and a chance to gain some confidence. So I’ve done loads of radio since then, and if there was a bit of lingering nervousness at the BBC it soon started to lift.’
