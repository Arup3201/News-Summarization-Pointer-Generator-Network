New Bayern Munich signing Robert Lewandowski gave a glimpse of things to come with a superb improvised finish in a pre season friendly against Borussia Monchengladbach.

The Polish centre forward arrived this summer on a free transfer from Bundesliga rivals Borussia Dortmund - and he already has two pre season goals since his arrival.

The second of those came on Sunday with a chip over the outcoming goalkeeper used as a way to get past his four markers in the box.

And while Bayern drew 2-2 before eventually winning on penalties, it was a happy occasion all round with Franck Ribery making his return to the side after the back injury which ruled him out of the World Cup.

And with Lewandowski looking like the perfect line leader for Pep Guardiola's side, the German champions could again have their opponents quaking in their boots at home and abroad.
