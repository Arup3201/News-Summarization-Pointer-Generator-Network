A Thomas Cook flight from Sofia in Bulgaria to London Gatwick was diverted to Budapest and delayed more than 17 hours after cabin crew reported 'smoke in the flight deck'.

The Boeing 757-300 flight MT-1125 was at around 34,000 feet to the south of Budapest when smoke was sighted in the cabin and the plane was redirected on Saturday. 

The aircraft landed safely at Budapest airport with the smoke having dissipated but the smell of burning still present, before Hungarian emergency services attended.

Passengers were delayed a total of 17 hours and 17 minutes after smoke was reported in the cabin

Passengers were taken to hotels for the night while safety checks were carried out on the plane.

Following inspections, it is believed the most likely cause of the smoke entering the cabin was a suspected oil overspill. 

In total the delay lasted 17 hours and 17 minutes, said Thomas Cook, before passengers were taken to Gatwick on Sunday on board the same plane. 

A Thomas Cook spokesperson apologised to passengers for the wait while engineers looked over the plane and crew took their legally required rest.

Engineers carried out checks overnight at Budapest airport and it's believed the smoke in the cabin was most likely caused by a suspected oil overspill

We'd like to apologise to our customers for the delay to their flight from Sofia to Gatwick on Saturday, which was diverted to Budapest as a precaution following smoke entering the cabin,' the Thomas Cook representative said. 

'After the fault was investigated overnight, the aircraft continued to Gatwick on Sunday afternoon – accommodation and welfare was provided during the delay. 

We know how frustrating such long delays are and we'd like to thank our customers for their patience.'
