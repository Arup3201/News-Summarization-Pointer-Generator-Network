He has become used to rewriting the record books these past few years, amending football history in style with wonderful goals and dazzling pieces of skill.

But there's one record Lionel Messi has some way to go to break - one held by England's very own Jimmy Greaves.

It is the all-time leading goalscorer list across Europe's top five divisions - England, Spain, Italy, France and Germany - but at least the Barcelona wizard is making progress up the ladder.

Messi's goal in Barca's 3-1 win at Granada on Saturday was his 269th in the Spanish league and took him into the top 10 of the all-time standings for league goals, as pointed out by MisterChip on Twitter.

However, he is still some way behind Greaves' tally of 366 league goals set between 1957 and 1971. The prolific England international striker scored 357 goals for Chelsea, Tottenham and West Ham in the English top flight, plus nine for AC Milan in Serie A.

It set some precedent, one almost matched by Gerd Muller, who scored 365 goals for Bayern Munich in the German top flight and is second in the table.

There is then a gap to the pre-war English scoring duo of Steve Bloomer (317 Division One goals between 1892 and 1914) and Dixie Dean (310 between 1924 and 1938).

German legend Gerd Muller is second on the all-time list, just one goal behind Greaves

Messi's rival, Cristiano Ronaldo of Real Madrid, is sixth on the goalscorers list

Alan Shearer, with his familiar celebration for Newcastle United, comes in eighth on the list with 283 goals

One man Messi will be desperate to catch is his rival Cristiano Ronaldo, currently sixth in the list with 291 goals in Europe's top five leagues - 84 for Manchester United in the Premier League and 207 for Real Madrid in La Liga.

Alan Shearer is eighth, with 283 goals for Southampton, Blackburn Rovers and Newcastle United in the English top flight.

If they continue at their present free-scoring rate, it's highly likely Ronaldo and Messi will one day be topping this list.

But the key question remains - in which order will they finish?
