Luis Suarez insists he never got anxious about his difficult start to life at Barcelona.

The former Liverpool striker found goals hard to come by at the Nou Camp but scored against 10-man Athletic Bilbao on Sunday night during Barcelona's 5-2 win in La Liga.

Suarez's £75million transfer last summer brought with it expectation and he has started to repay Barcelona's faith in 2015.

'I did not get nervous, because the only thing I worry about is not being able to help the team,' Suarez told Canal Plus. 'I'm very self-critical and when I play badly, I get very angry.

'But I knew that the goals would come and, with the support from my team-mates and my family, now they have arrived. It is a pleasure to play alongside phenomena like Leo (Messi) and Neymar.'

Suarez was whistled by Bilbao supporters at the San Mames Stadium as they felt he exaggerated the foul which led to Xabier Etxeita being sent off.

'I think it was unfair but I will not enter into any controversy,' he added. 'As you will see on television, I was hurt by the challenge.'
