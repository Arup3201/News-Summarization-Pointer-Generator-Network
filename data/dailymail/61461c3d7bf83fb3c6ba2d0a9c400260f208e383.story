Hilarious: Baby Sadie was caught on camera trying salt and vinegar chips for the first time - and her facial expressions are priceless

'It's pretty apparent she kept coming back for more,' dad Graham Simon told ABC News.

'I think that's the effect of the chips for everyone - the initial cringe, and then you realize how good they are. I think she reacted like most adults do.'

Simon Graham and his wife Joanna fed Sadie the chips because they are Joanna's favorite food.

'Sadie is starting to eat pretty much everything, so Joanna's been giving Sadie all her favorite foods,' Simon Graham said.

'Joanna is from Canada and dips the chips in milk, which is something they do there. These were not dipped in milk. Soon, I'm sure.'

First taste: After taking her first bite, little Sadie squinted her eyes in shock at the sour taste

Processing: Sadie, 14 months, leans back in her chair, perhaps to process the intense flavor of the salt and vinegar chips

Barely coping: It looks like Sadie is forcing herself to eat the chip, opening her mouth wide as the sour crisp touches her tongue
