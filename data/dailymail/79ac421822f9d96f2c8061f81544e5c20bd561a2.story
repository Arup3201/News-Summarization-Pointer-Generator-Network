Tragic: Nicole Waterhouse, 32, was killed in the attack in a flat in York. A man has been arrested

Police have charged a man with the murder and attempted murder of an estate agent and her flatmate.

Jeremy Green, 25, has been remanded in custody after appearing at York Magistrates' Court this morning.

He is charged with the murder of Nicole Waterhouse, 32, and the attempted murder of her flatmate Karen Browne, 23 and will reappear at Leeds Crown Court on November 6.

Miss Waterhouse was killed in a bloody attack at her city centre apartment on Sunday.

The attack also left her colleague, Miss Browne, with serious stab wounds.

Six hours after police discovered the women, who had been the victims of a 'sustained attack', officers arrested Green at an address one mile away in York.

He is said to be known to at least one of the victims.

A police spokesperson said they are not looking for anyone else in connection with the incident.

Officers were called to the women's home in an upmarket housing development in York at 8pm Sunday where they found Miss Waterhouse dead.

Her friend and flatmate Miss Browne, 23, was also found to have suffered ‘serious’ stab wounds to the shoulder.

She was described as ‘critically ill’ in an intensive care unit last night and is too poorly for police to interview her.

Detective Superintendent Dai Malyn said: ‘Both girls suffered multiple serious injuries and the attack must have been a sustained one. Clearly Nicole died from her injuries and Karen is critically ill in hospital.

'Detectives will be guided by medical staff as to the appropriate time to speak with Karen.

'To assist this investigation we appeal to anybody who can assist us with both girl's movements during Sunday 20th October from approximately 7am through to the time they were discovered at approximately 7.30pm.

'If you were with either or both of them and can assist us piece together where they have been during these hours, it is essential that you come forward.

'We are also still searching for mobile phones belonging to the victims and suspect. These are a white Samsung Galaxy phone in a pink slip cover and a white iPhone.

Investigation: Police at the block of flats in York where Nicole Waterhouse was murdered

The
victims worked for Hunters Estate Agents. Miss Waterhouse was the 
daughter of founding partner John Waterhouse and she worked as a sales 
negotiator in the York office. 

Managing
director Kevin Hollinrake said: ‘Everyone is just devastated. We are a 
very close business and our thoughts are wholeheartedly with Nicki’s 
family at this time. Nicki always had a smile on her face and will be 
deeply missed by everyone.’

Miss Browne was a sales negotiator in the firm’s Wetherby branch.

Miss
Waterhouse’s family refused to comment yesterday. Miss Browne’s family 
were believed to be at her bedside at York District Hospital.

A
relative, Lisa Browne, wrote on Facebook: ‘It’s at times like this 
reality hits and you realise that the important things in life isn’t 
what you own, what you drive, where you go on holiday but family.

‘Family
cannot be bought and cannot be replaced. Cherish them, love them, spoil
them, forgive them but most of all love them – they can be taken away 
in a heartbeat.’

A police cordon at Phoenix Boulevard, where the women lived, was still in place yesterday.

Ian
Clancy, 52, and his partner live in a top-floor flat facing the scene, 
and said they heard banging from the flats shortly before the ambulance 
arrived.

He said: ‘Minutes 
later police turned up and I knew it was something really bad going on 
because I have never seen so many police.

'There must have been nine 
police vehicles and two ambulances at one stage.

Gathering evidence: Police remove a vehicle as part of the investigation

'Then, a good half-hour 
to 40 minutes later, I saw a girl coming out on a stretcher. She didn’t 
look good. It’s just unbelievable. It’s just devastating.’

Another
resident Margaret Raisbeck said: ‘It’s very quiet around here, you 
usually never see or hear anyone. I have lived here six years and I have
never seen any police activity.’

Superintendent
Malyn added: ‘We are still looking for the weapon or weapons used.

'If 
you were in the area prior to the incident being reported to the police 
and witnessed or heard a disturbance, I urge you to get in touch.’

Sorry we are unable to accept comments for legal reasons.
