For all Anderson's faults, you can't knock his bravery. Before taking part in the ice bucket challenge last week, the Brazilian nominated his old boss Sir Alex Ferguson to suffer the same freezing fate.

It raised a few nervous chuckles inside the Manchester United camp but it would have to be an icy day in hell before Ferguson accepts this challenge, especially from a player who has flopped so spectacularly.

Ferguson had such sky-high hopes for Anderson. Back in 2007, he was going to be the new Roy Keane and the long-term replacement for Paul Scholes.

To borrow the words of Ferguson's scout brother Martin, he was set to be bigger than Wayne Rooney. He was destined to become an Old Trafford icon, it was inevitable.

These promises were enough to persuade Ferguson to part with £27m. Rooney had cost just £20m, Cristiano Ronaldo £12m but Anderson Luis de Abreu Oliveira was tipped to rise above them both.

Today, Anderson is still only 26 and United can't get rid of him quickly enough.

There was a time when Anderson against Arsenal's Cesc Fabregas was the new Keane-Vieira and, often, the Brazilian was emphatically the victor.

Now, he is being spun around in circles by League One defenders.

United and Anderson hit a new nadir in Tuesday night's 4-0 humbling at MK Dons and to say the player was ineffective was the understatement of the season.

Over the course of the last seven years, Anderson has spiralled from one of the hottest properties in world football to an overweight laughing stock. It is one of the biggest falls from grace the English game has ever seen.

The man has four Premier League winners' medals and lifted the Champions League in 2008, but nobody would deem his time at United a success.

He should be in the prime of his career but looks like a man winding down in the twilight years. He is washed up, unloved and unwanted, with even a few months on loan at Fiorentina last season failing to revitalise him.

Anderson is a lost talent and the Brazilian legend Tostao summed up his demise in a recent interview with FourFourTwo magazine.

'When [Brazilians] move to the Premier League, I think they become more disciplined, get to know the importance of the collective game and develop the tactical part.

'The point is to learn all this without losing technique. If they cannot do this, it's their fault.

'Anderson is a classic case. If you remember him as a young player, he was pretty much like Neymar, but after playing there he became predictable.

'But he's the only one to blame for this. It's not down to the Premier League.'

Little wonder the Brazilian national team selectors turned their back on him six years ago, they could see any skill had been sacrificed and there wasn't a lot left.

For someone billed as a devoted, box-to-box midfielder, it is surprising that fitness has been such an issue. In 71 starts for United, he has finished only 20 games.

Unwanted: David Moyes included Anderson in just eight games before sending him out on loan

Injuries to his knee, hamstring and calf have all struck over the last four seasons but, when fit, Anderson has been unwilling to put in the effort to try and impress.

Ferguson gave up on him long before his retirement and David Moyes included him only eight times, usually in short cameos from the bench.

Louis van Gaal has given every member of his squad a fair hearing but his inclusion at stadium:mk came only as a result of a debilitating injury crisis.

Now the future is uncertain. Anderson is part of the deadwood the Dutchman wants off the wage bill, yet no one seems willing to take him.

There was talk of a return to Fiorentina for another loan spell but their interest has cooled. United will listen to any offers.

It is, alas, a classic case of massive potential unfulfilled. Anderson's nomination of Ferguson for the ice bucket challenge may well be the most memorable thing he does this season.
