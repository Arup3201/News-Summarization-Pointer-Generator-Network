An over-eager fan who ran onto the court to touch Cavaliers All-Star guard Kyrie Irving was crash-tackled and handcuffed by security during Cleveland's 99-79 victory over Utah at Quicken Loans Arena on Friday night.

The dramatic moment, which happened during the fourth quarter and was caught on camera, sees the ambitious admirer pushed to the ground within seconds of getting up close to the towering NBA star, who seemed startled by the encounter but not scared.

While the fan - who is yet to be identified - is facing a public nuisance charge, if speaking with Irving was what he set out to do then he succeeded.

After the game Irving spoke of the incident and what the two managed to say to each other in the brief moment, according to Cleveland.com.

'He told me he loved me, I told him, ''I love you, too, bro'',' Irving said.

'The police didn’t think it was a joke.

'It goes back to the emotional and deep-rooted support the fans have for the team.

'It was a great honor, but to do it during the game … maybe he could have waited until after the game?'

It is the second time a fan has approached Irving on the court this season.

It is also the third time in le3ss than a year that ther3 has been a fan incident at the Quickens Loans Arena.

In December a fan walked up to Irving during a game against the Clippers in an apparent attempt to get him to look at his “Kyrie, Don’t Leave” t-shirt.

A recent ESPN.com report indicated that Irving might not be totally happy in Cleveland, where the Cavaliers are on track to miss the playoffs for the fourth straight year.
