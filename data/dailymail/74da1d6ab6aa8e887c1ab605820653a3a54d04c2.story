Casey Anthony refused to tell lawyers why she made up her story about Zanny The Nanny kidnapping her daughter Caylee and threatened to storm out of a new deposition released this week.

The mother, who was cleared of killing her daughter in 2011, was facing fresh questions from attorneys for Zenaida Gonzalez, who is suing Anthony for defamation.

Gonzalez says the similarity of her name to Zanny The Nanny meant that some people thought she was to blame for Caylee's disappearance.

Hiding: Casey Anthony, pictured in March last year, has been seen little since she was acquitted of her daughter's murder in 2011

But Anthony insisted to Gonzalez's lawyers that Zanny The Nanny was a real person and she had not made up the name as a code for the prescription drug Xanax.

In the 
contentious January 23 deposition, Anthony claimed that Zenaida 
Fernandez-Gonzalez was someone she'd last seen in 2007 and who had baby-sat
 Caylee just once.

‘I met her at Universal Studios in 2006… through a mutual friend,’ Anthony said, adding: ‘We were friends a little over a year.’

But she admitted that the real Zanny The Nanny did not kidnap Caylee, as she initially claimed after disappearance.

Miss Gonzalez 
sued in 2008 after Anthony claimed that a similarly-named nanny had 
kidnapped two-year-old Caylee.

Authorities ultimately determined the 
nanny didn't exist and the girl was dead, although Anthony was eventually acquitted of murder in Caylee's death after a high-profile trial.

Court battle: Zenaida Gonzalez argues her lawsuit should survive the bankruptcy because Anthony was 'willful and malicious' in damaging her reputation

In the contentious January 23 deposition, Anthony claimed that Zenaida Fernandez-Gonzalez, the nanny she claimed had kidnapped her daughter, was a real person

On July 5, 2011, the jury found Casey not guilty of first degree murder, aggravated child abuse, and aggravated manslaughter of a child, but guilty of four misdemeanor counts of providing false information to a law enforcement officer.

The not guilty murder verdict was greeted with public outrage, and was both attacked and defended by media and legal commentators who complained that the jury had misunderstood the meaning of reasonable doubt.

During the deposition, Anthony admitted she made 
up the story about dropping her daughter Caylee off with the fictional 
babysitter at the Sawgrass apartments in Orlando, Florida, the same 
address as the woman suing her. And she admitted to lying to the police 
about it.

But when Gonzalez' lawyer Keith Mitnik pressed and asked 
what happened to Caylee and whether she knew her child was alive or dead
 at the time she claimed to have dropped her off with the fictional 
babysitter, Anthony threatened to walk out.

‘At the advice of 
counsel, I decline to answer questions about my daughter. If you ask me 
again, I will walk out of this room,’ she said.

A transcript of the two hour deposition was filed in federal court on Tuesday.

Mitnik
 expressed skepticism of Anthony's claim that the nanny was a 
real person.

‘Now, is there any way in the world that you could 
suggest to me that I might find this person to see if she ever existed?’
 Mitnik asked Anthony.

Anthony replied: ‘I don't know if you could or not, sir.’

Mitnik
 reminded Anthony that Baez said at trial that she had difficulty 
telling the truth: ‘Do you have a significant problem with not telling 
the truth?’

Victim: Caylee Marie Anthony went missing in June 2008 and was found in a wooded area near her grandparents house six months later

‘No, sir, I do not,’ Anthony replied.

She also denied 
that the nickname ‘Zanny the nanny’ was a reference to the knockout drug
 Xanax, and that she had ever given drugs of any kind to her daughter.

The
 deposition was part of the ongoing legal wrangling surrounding Anthony's 
Chapter 7 bankruptcy.

Gonzalez argues her lawsuit should survive the 
bankruptcy because Anthony was ‘willful and malicious’ in damaging her 
reputation.

At the crux of the suit are comments Anthony made to her 
mother, Cindy, during a jailhouse visit.

Anthony allegedly said she 
hadn't ruled out Gonzalez as a suspect, information her mother relayed 
to reporters.

Anthony said she didn't 
authorize her parents to represent her in the media: 'I had zero control
 over that. I was in jail, Mr. Mitnik. I had no control over anything.'

As the deposition neared its end, Anthony emphatically said she never blamed the woman suing her for Caylee's disappearance.

'That's
 never been the case and that will never be the truth. So let's get that
 straight right here and now. You can ask a hundred more ridiculous 
questions. I'm not going to answer them,' she said. 'I'm done here.'
