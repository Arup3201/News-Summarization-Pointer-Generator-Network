A neighbour of Oscar Pistorius testified at his murder trial  that she heard gunshots, screaming and then a second set of gun shots on the night that the double-amputee runner fatally shot girlfriend Reeva Steenkamp.

The testimony by Anette Stipp matched some of the testimony by other witnesses who have said they also heard a woman screaming around the time that Pistorius killed Steenkamp before dawn on Feb. 14, 2013.  

The defence has countered that the neighbours were actually hearing Pistorius screaming in a high-pitched voice after he shot Steenkamp, a 29-year-old model.

Pistorius has said he shot his girlfriend by mistake through a locked toilet door, thinking that she was an intruder in his home.

Under questioning from chief prosecutor Gerrie Nel, Stipp said she heard gunshots while lying awake around 3 a.m. on the night of the shooting, and then heard the 'terrified, terrified' screams of a woman.  

'The screaming at that stage just continued,' said Stipp, who recalled looking out from a balcony at two houses with lights on in the gated estate where her family and Pistorius lived.   

She said she told her husband Johan, who 
previously testified, that the screaming sounded as though a 'family 
murder' had taken place.

Defence: Lawyer Barry Roux has said that after Pistorius fired into the door that he battered the door with a cricket bat to try to get to Steenkamp after realising she was inside the toilet cubicle 

'There was definitely a female screaming for quite a period,' Anette Stipp said. 'You could definitely hear two different voices.'  

She said she then heard a second set of shots, and the screaming stopped.  

Defence lawyer Barry Roux has said that after Pistorius fired into the door that he battered the door with a cricket bat to try to get to Steenkamp after realising she was inside the toilet cubicle. 

Roux insists that some neighbours who testified mistook the sound of the cricket bat striking the door for gunshots.

Nel has said he will wrap up his case against Pistorius this week after calling four or five more witnesses to support his contention that the Olympian intentionally killed Steenkamp after an argument. 

The defence will then present its case. 

Judicial officials say the trial will continue until May 16, with a recess in April.

Prosecutors at Oscar Pistorius' murder trial have presented a 'golden thread' of evidence suggesting Reeva Steenkamp screamed before she died, leaving the double-amputee athlete with 'serious questions' to answer and his defense likely hinging on his own testimony, a legal expert in South Africa said.

Three neighbours say they heard a woman scream before and during the deadly gunshots coming from Pistorius' home in the early hours of Valentine's Day last year.The pathologist who performed the autopsy on Steenkamp's body said it would have been 'abnormal' for her not to scream from some of her injuries.

A police ballistics expert concluded that the first shot Pistorius fired through a toilet door hit Steenkamp in the hip and caused her to collapse, but didn't immediately kill her.

The second shot missed. From the policeman's testimony, Steenkamp likely had time to yell out before she was hit by two more shots as she covered her head with her arms in a desperate attempt to protect herself.

'Suddenly what we have is Oscar Pistorius firing at Reeva Steenkamp while her hands are covering her head while she's screaming in the toilet, and that's murder,' said Marius du Toit, a defense lawyer and former state prosecutor who says he has worked on at least 100 murder cases.

Du Toit, who is following the trial but not involved, said the prosecution has 'definitely' made a case for murder against the Olympic runner for the fatal shooting of Steenkamp, and Pistorius' defense must now respond.

Chief prosecutor Gerrie Nel has so far presented a specific line of evidence compellingly, du Toit said.

Using the accounts of neighbors and backing them up with the expert opinion of pathologist Gert Saayman and police ballistics investigator Capt. Christiaan Mangena, Nel may have shown to the court that it was 'reasonable' that Steenkamp screamed during the four shots fired at her, du Toit said.

'There's definitely a golden thread here,' du Toit told The Associated Press in a telephone interview, using a courtroom term that refers to the prosecution's duty to prove guilt beyond a reasonable doubt.

'A golden thread of someone who was screaming and who was shot. The objective facts, which are the injuries she sustained, coupled with the expert opinion, tied with your circumstantial evidence presented by witnesses. And if that ties up with one another then Oscar has got a major problem.'
