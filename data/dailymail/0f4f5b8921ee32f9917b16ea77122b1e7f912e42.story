A town is ‘under siege’ from travellers who have set up 79 illegal camps in a year.

Caravans have been parked on verges, roundabouts, cycle tracks and school grounds in Harlow, Essex.

Residents say they feel intimidated, and accuse the Irish travellers of leaving piles of rubbish behind as they move from place to place avoiding authorities.

A line of caravans on a pavement in Harlow, Essex, where residents say the number of illegal camps is quickly growing and have demanded action

More than 2,000 people in the town have signed a petition calling on authorities to tackle the problem

One weekend last month, 18 vehicles descended on a special needs school, which was left unable to open on the Monday morning amid fears of what would happen as children arrived. With police on their way, the headteacher persuaded the group to move on.

Evicting and cleaning up after the group, believed to be mostly from three or four families, cost taxpayers more than £41,000 up to August. That bill is now estimated to have passed £50,000.

Yesterday, local Tory MP Robert Halfon said: ‘Residents have been living under siege, in fear and misery for the past year. It’s shocking that this is allowed.’ 

The camps have ranged in size from one caravan to more than 30, and may last a few days – or several weeks. Sometimes the group move of their own accord, and sometimes they are moved on, only to find another spot close by.

Mr Halfon said they were ‘holding a gun to the council’s head’ in an attempt to get a legal permanent site. He wants a change in the law to make it a criminal offence to set up an illegal camp.

Last night mother-of-eight Theresa Donovan, wife of the travellers’ leader Patrick Donovan, 47, said: ‘We’ve been served a notice to move on – we’ll leave this camp but we won’t leave Harlow.

‘Our kids are all booked into local schools so we won’t be leaving. We’ve got nowhere else to go.’

She added that the group hoped to win a legal camp.

‘There’s already two Marks and Spencer shops in the town and they’re building a third – if they had a choice why would they not give it to the traveller people?’ 

Locals say 70 sites have appeared in the town in the last year, but little has been done to tackle the issue

Mrs Donovan said they came to Harlow in October 2013 after being evicted from land they purchased in nearby Epping. Section 61 of the Criminal Justice and Public Order Act allows police to force trespassers to leave if they have more than six vehicles, damage land or use threatening words or behaviour. Councils can get an injunction or a county court possession order to protect land.

More than 2,000 Harlow residents have signed an e-petition calling for official action.

A resident wrote online: ‘Travellers feel they have the right to intimidate people for using public footpaths that they have decided to set up camp by. Why should these people have more rights than those who abide by the law?’ 

The town is less than 30 miles from the Dale Farm camp, which was cleared out following legal action in 2011

Harlow has two legal traveller sites with a total of 44 pitches, but there is not enough room for the newcomers. Council officials have started a day-by-day diary to keep up with the group as they move from one illegal camp to another.

It shows all 79 encampments and how many caravans were at each.

Yesterday’s entry states there are now three illegal camps in Harlow. The largest, 21 caravans, sits on a cycle track owned by Essex County Council. Two caravans are in a Harlow Council car park, and nine on private land near a social club.

Essex Police visited the cycle track yesterday and gave the group a deadline of 9am today to leave.

The travellers are said to split into smaller groups so councils have to take out more eviction notices.

Harlow Council said it is taking action to protect its land and a possession hearing is due to take place next week. It has written to the Government calling for new laws to end the ‘expensive and disruptive cat-and-mouse game where travellers merely move from one site to another’.

Council leader Jon Clempner said the ‘balance’ between travellers’ and residents’ rights needed to be reviewed, adding: ‘We are doing everything we legally can.’

Chief Superintendent Sean O’Callaghan, of Essex police, said the force would ‘not hesitate to serve Section 61 notices’ where possible. He said a number had been served, but added that police cannot stop camps forming: ‘We can only use this power if it is lawful, necessary and proportionate.’

Harlow is 29 miles from Dale Farm, Britain’s most notorious illegal camp until it was dismantled after violent confrontation with bailiffs and riot police. The eviction, after a ten-year stand-off at the site near Basildon, cost £7million.
