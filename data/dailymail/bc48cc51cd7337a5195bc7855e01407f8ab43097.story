The heiress to the Walmart fortune is demanding $90,000 from a multi-millionaire property developer because she claims construction work on a Bel Air mega-mansion destroyed a beloved eucalyptus tree.

Nancy Walton Laurie claims a wall at the sprawling Los Angeles property being developed by multi-millionaire Mohamed Hadid has 'cut the roots to the family's cherished eucalyptus tree, causing it severe damage and putting it at risk of falling over.'

The house called 901 Strada Vecchia has caused outrage among neighbors, with many contesting that it has violated building permits and size restrictions. 

Hadid is the former husband of Real Housewives of Beverly Hills star Yolanda Foster and father of supermodel Gigi Hadid, 19.

He is renowned for building enormous properties in LA including the $195million 'Palazzo di Amore' - said to be the most expensive home on the US market. 

Angry: Nancy Walton Laurie claims a Bel Air mansion property being developed has 'cut the roots to her family's 'cherished' eucalyptus tree, causing it severe damage and putting it at risk of falling over.'

Developer: Mohamed Hadid (pictured with his model daughter Gigi, 19) is renowned for building enormous properties in LA including the $195million 'Palazzo di Amore' - said to be the most expensive home publically available on the US market

According to a summary judgement filed to the company, obtained by the Beverly Hills Courier, LW Partnership contends the home's designer Mohamed Hadid's company 'with full knowledge of the boundry line between the parties' properties, nevertheless constructed a wall that stands at least 100 feet on the neighboring family's property without the family's consent. 

'In the process, his company cut the roots to the family's cherished eucalyptus tree, causing it severe damage and putting it at risk of falling over.'

Hadid's attorney, Bruce Rudman, insists the new wall has been built in exactly the same place as the old one.

He said: 'We have an arborist who says the tree is thriving, and at one point in time was suffering from the drought. 

'This isn't about money. This is about principle. The wall serves the land much better than little piece of land they are complaining about.'

In September construction was halted at the home after neighbor and entertainment lawyer Joseph Horacek III waged war at Hadid and the project. 

He claimed Hadid illegally demolished the original house located there and stipulated the construction had exceeded height limits. 

While 'bombarding' city officials with complaints about the project, he nicknamed it the 'Starship Enterprise'.
