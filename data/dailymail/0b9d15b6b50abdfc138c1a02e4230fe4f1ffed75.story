A 53-year-old man has been charged with a racially aggravated public order offence after Millwall fans appeared to hurl racist abuse at a Leeds striker.

Gerrard Scanlon, 53, from Enfield, north London, is accused of using threatening, abusive or insulting words likely to cause harassment, alarm or distress.

The delivery driver was released on police bail and is due to appear at Bromley Magistrates' Court on February 27.

Caught on camera: A fan is filmed making racist remarks during a Millwall game by Sky Sports News

He was arrested after Sky Sports News
broadcast footage that appeared to show some Millwall fans 
hurling insults at Senegal forward El-Hadji Diouf during a game at The Den, in south-east London, on November 18.

Millwall said they were 'appalled' by
the footage and vowed to reopen an investigation into allegations of 
racial abuse, which initially emerged online.

Club captain Danny Shittu said he was 'deeply saddened' by what he had seen in the documentary.

Millwall have promised to ban any individuals for life if they are found guilty.

Abuse: Sky Sports News picked up another fan making racist remarks

Millwall chief executive Andy Ambler
said that an initial investigation by the club was closed after Diouf said he heard
no racist abuse aimed at him.

'Like all Millwall fans and football fans generally, we're appalled by the footage we've seen,' Ambler said.

'Sadly racism exists in our society and certain individuals want to bring it into football grounds. It's down to us in football do to more.

Shittu later released a statement on the club website which read: 'I am deeply saddened by the documentary on Sky Sports showing racism by the minority at matches including at Millwall FC.

Anger: Leeds forward El-Hadji Diouf was believed to be the target of racist abuse

'As the current Millwall captain, racism is something I do not stand for or condone.

'I am currently in talks with the club about any further measures we can take in dealing with and eradicating racism at matches.

'I do not want the events shown yesterday to tarnish the hard work done by the club thus far and their efforts in tackling this issue.

'Every player at all levels has the right to represent their club without being subjected to homophobic or racial taunts. I will do all I can to help eradicate racism at my club and in football.'

Bolton forward Marvin Sordell has previously made allegations of racial abuse towards Millwall's fans.

A banner stating 'Sordell is a c***' was unfurled at a later game which came in the wake of his claims, while a 13-year-old boy was banned from the ground.
