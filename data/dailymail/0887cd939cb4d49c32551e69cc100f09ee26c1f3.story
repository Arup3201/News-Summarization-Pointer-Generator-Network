Arthur hit Canada's Maritime provinces Saturday with near-hurricane strength winds and torrential rains, knocking down trees and leaving more than 200,000 customers without power.

Canadian Hurricane Centre spokesman Chris Fogarty said that winds were easing, but more rainfall is predicted for already drenched southwestern New Brunswick.

Arthur was downgraded from a hurricane to a post-tropical storm Saturday morning by the time it reached Atlantic Canada after swiping a day earlier at North Carolina's Outer Banks, but it still packed a punch.

Environment Canada measured wind gusts topping 72 mph (116 kph) in Halifax, while more than 4 inches (11 centimeters) of rain had already fallen on parts of southwestern New Brunswick.

At 3 p.m. ADT (2 p.m. EDT, 1800 GMT) Saturday, Arthur was 28 miles (45 kilometers) southwest of Moncton, New Brunswick, with maximum sustained winds of 62 mph (100 kph), the Canadian Hurricane Centre said.

Late Saturday morning, Nova Scotia Power said 113,000 of its customers were without power. The utility in New Brunswick reported almost 100,000 outages by mid-afternoon. It warned some residents they could be without power for up to 48 hours because of widespread damage caused by the storm.

NB Power said the largest number of outages was in Fredericton where winds of more than 62 mph (100 kmh) had knocked down a number of large trees. Police in Saint John, New Brunswick, said some local roads were closed because they were covered by flood water.

The storm also caused flight cancellations and delays at the region's largest airport in Halifax, Nova Scotia.

The Royal Canadian Mounted Police in Prince Edward Island said a number of electrical poles had been knocked down by the storm and roads were blocked by downed trees.

The Canadian Hurricane Center said the storm would end in the Maritimes overnight and then track northeast through the Gulf of St. Lawrence toward Newfoundland on Sunday.

In the United States, North Carolina's popular beach towns began returning to the business of recreation Saturday, after Arthur lashed the state's coast with forceful winds and heavy rain and then churned northward without leaving a trail of significant damage.

New England was largely spared from damage spawned by the storm, but some 19,000 people in Maine and 1,600 in Vermont were without power after high winds and heavy rains pounded the region. There were reports of localized flooding in coastal areas of Massachusetts and the Nova Star Ferry suspended service Friday and Saturday morning because of dangerous seas. No injuries or deaths have been reported.

The hurricane's effects in North Carolina were mostly confined to Hatteras and Ocracoke islands, and some vacationers were already back on beaches to the north and south on Friday. But the ocean churned by Arthur remained dangerous Saturday with the risk of rip currents able to wash the strongest swimmer to sea. That didn't stop thousands of people from enjoying the sun and sand and leaving lifeguards to remind beach-goers of the danger.

'We're going to try to keep people out of the water and keep them safe,' said David Elder, lifeguard supervisor for the town of Kill Devil Hills. 'However, if conditions abate, I'd be glad to drop' the no-swimming warning. More than 600 of the 700 lifeguard rescues by Elder's department last year were required because of rip currents, he said.

The only road onto Hatteras Island was reopened to all traffic on Saturday afternoon, hours after permanent residents were first allowed to return. The island had been closed to visitors since early Thursday. With many weeklong cottage rentals running Saturday to Saturday, local businesses were hoping to salvage the second half of the holiday weekend.

A small section of fragile North Carolina Highway 12 buckled after being submerged by churning waters during the Category 2 hurricane. Officials also tested the two-mile-long Bonner Bridge onto the island to ensure it was safe for traffic. The road also suffered extensive flooding in some areas and officials warned drivers to watch for pockets of sand on the highway.

Farther south, Ocracoke Island's electricity distribution system was badly damaged by Arthur, leading officials to order residents to quit using air conditioners and water heaters so that generator-supplied power could provide refrigeration and other necessities during a cycle of planned outages. A nightly curfew between 10 p.m. and 6 a.m. was declared until power was fully restored. Vacationers were being coaxed to leave with the offer of free ferry rides out.

Parts of Rodanthe and Salvo were flooded on Friday across nearly the entire width of Hatteras Island from the ocean to the sound. Trailers toppled in campgrounds where they were left, pictures from a Coast Guard helicopter that flew over the island showed.

Josh Fiscus was still cleaning up the mess at his Salvo home Saturday.

'We had about two feet of water here in my garage,' he said.

Jackson Whitley, 14, was back to another day of picking up wind-blown debris and fallen tree limbs from around his family's Buxton home much as he did Friday. Apart from the lack of normal summertime crowds, he said streets were pretty much back to normal.

Linda Savage, 65, said she and a neighbor collected a small refrigerator and a trash can with lid intact left behind by flood waters about three feet deep. The flooding rose almost to the front door of her Salvo home without seeping inside, but Arthur's winds of almost 100 mph caused other damage.

'I lost a tremendous amount of shingles from my roof,' Savage said.

She planned to shop for groceries Saturday, and hoped the cable television and Internet would be restored soon.

On
 North Carolina's Outer Banks, which were hit by the brunt of the storm, 
Arthur left behind flooding, washed out roads, damaged homes and more 
than 41,000 without power on Friday morning, but the beaches were 
reopened by the holiday.

'The
 North Carolina beaches are open for business and they're open for 
tourists,' Gov. Pat McCrory said. 'The umbrellas are going up as we 
speak right now.'

Tens
 of thousands evacuated the barrier island chain and fled inland ahead 
of the storm. There were no deaths and few injuries reported, and 
McCrory even attended a parade in Southport.

Jesse and Carol Wray could see outside their home in Salvo on North Carolina Highway 12 that the road was submerged under several feet of water Friday morning.

The six-foot-tall lamppost at the end of their driveway was under water except for its top, and that was after the sound a quarter-mile away receded several feet since first light, said Jesse Wray, 68, a retired Norfolk, Virginia, firefighter.

'I'm surprised that it got this bad. There's all kind of debris floating around here. I know a lot of people who lost their houses around here' if they were built on the ground instead of elevated, Jesse Wray said. Wray's home is on pilings nine feet off the ground and avoided water inside.

About seven
 miles south on the island, Frank Folb, 70, said his brick home on a 
rise in Buxton suffered no damage. Tomato plants in his garden were 
twisted and broken, but 'overall it's not bad,' he said. 'I've been 
losing electricity but I slept through the night pretty well.'

Paul
 Wernock said water about 3 feet deep surrounded his Rodanthe, North 
Carolina, home but was receding early Friday. 'We have one giant mess' 
from tree damage and debris, but no obvious structural damage to homes 
on his side street, he said.

Four cruise ships were also diverted to avoid the path of the storm. Norwegian Gem cancelled a scheduled port of call at Great Stirrup Cay in the Bahamas due to the incoming storm.

Three ships operated by Royal Caribbean also cancelled scheduled stops at CocoCay in the Bahamas in a bid to move on and stay ahead of Hurricane Arthur and its surrounding high winds and rain.

Majesty of the Seas, Enchantment of the Seas and Grandeur of the Seas will instead spend extra time at sea.

More than 20,000 customers were without power near North Carolina's coast early on Friday morning, according to utility Duke Energy.

Officials in many cities prepared for the worst. The
 annual Boston Pops Fourth of July concert and fireworks
show was rescheduled for Thursday because of potential heavy rain from 
Arthur. The fireworks thundered and flashed over the Charles River, just
 beating the storm.
