The fiance of a missing South Carolina woman was seen leaving the woods where her SUV was found carrying a shovel, police say.

Witnesses positively identified David Hedrick, 34, as leaving the woodland where Dara Lee Watson's burnt out SUV was found, police told a news conference yesterday.

Hedrick committed suicide by shooting himself in their Mount Pleasant, South Carolina home on Friday, hours after his 30-year-old accountant girlfriend was reported missing.

Missing: Dara Lee Watson, a 30-year-old accountant, was reported missing by her fiance David Hedrick on Friday

Friends said the couple had 'the perfect relationship'.

The pretty brunette was last seen by her mother on February 6. Watson's boss and sister both 
received text messages from her on February 8, although police now 
believe they were sent by Hedrick, WCBD TV reported. 

On Monday, locals reported what appeared to be fresh digging about 10 miles from the scene where Watson's SUV was found.

A forensic team  are investigating, 
but police told the local station that the uprooted soil seems to be unrelated to 
Watson's disappearance.

Police found Hedrick dead from a self-inflicted gunshot on Saturday at 12.45 a.m. He
had previously told Mount Pleasant police officers the pair had argued 
on Monday night and Watson had left their home on Tuesday morning.

Charleston County Coroner, Rae Wooten, confirmed during a news conference yesterday that David Hedrick's death was a suicide.

He did not leave a suicide note and police believe he took knowledge of Dara's whereabouts with him when he died.

Charles Gilbert and Patrick O'Neil 
who found Hedrick dead on Saturday said he was mild-tempered, didn't 
like confrontation and deeply in love with his fiance.

O'Neil said. 'He's always been 
tip-top, done the right thing, very successful, nice house,' 'It's very 
cliché but they're the perfect couple.'

'They were the most successful out of all of us, seemed like the happiest,' he added.

Something must have made Hedrick 'snap.' one friend told WCIV Charleston. 'Why else would he kill himself?'

Search party: More than 100 officers combed the Francis Marion National Forest on Saturday and Sunday after Dara's white GMC Envoy was found there on Friday

Found: Police are uncertain how long Miss Watson's SUV was in the woods. It has been taken away for investigation

More than 100 officers combed the Francis Marion National Forest on Saturday and Sunday after her white GMC Envoy was found there on Friday. They were joined by Watson's relatives.

'They just wanted to get a feel for the 
area - where the vehicle was located and just get a feel
for the area of the search and the magnitude of what was going on with 
the search,' Charleston County Sheriff's Office spokesman Major James Brady told WCIV

Search groups turned over leaves in 
several miles of wooded area, but the search ended around 3.30 p.m. with
no results, WCIV reported.

'We came out to expand the search that we initially started yesterday,' Brady said.

They
were looking for 'any evidence, any clues of anything that might tie 
into the case for the missing person, and to give it a better 
opportunity to search the areas a little bit deeper than yesterday'.

Brady told the news channel that search efforts would not continue in the area unless there were new leads.

Speaking to ABC4, Mount Pleasant 
police chief Harry Sewell added they were uncertain how long Watson's 
SUV had been in the woods.

'The vehicle was towed and is being searched for evidence,' he added.

'We're just trying our 
best to locate this young lady. We've had dogs searching the area 
looking for bodies. We've been looking for evidence. We don't really 
know what we're looking for.'

Watson's
mother - the last person apart from Hedrick to see the missing woman - 
saw her daughter on Monday in Boone, North Carolina.

Police
told ABC4 that Watson's mobile phone was last used on Wednesday 
February 8 at 7:30 p.m. in Mount Pleasant, according to cell tower 
information.

Mysterious: Police now believe texts from Watson's phone on February 8 were sent by Hedrick

Together: It is believed Watson and Hedrick had been a couple since 2009 and lived together in North Carolina

Watson's boss had also received a text 
message that day saying that she was fine - but the 30-year-old has not 
been heard from since.

Police stressed that they are still treating the case as a search for a missing person.

Even
though the missing person's report and apparent suicide occurred within
hours of each other, police have said it is too soon to link the 
incidents.

'At this point 
it's an active investigation,' Sewell said. 'We're trying to put the 
pieces of the puzzle together. Nothing is more important than finding 
Watson.'

Scene: Hedrick was found dead in his $410,000 home on Saturday. Neighbours said they had heard gunshots

Hedrick owned local bail bond company 
Palmetto Surety. In 2010, he bought the $410,000 house on North Creek 
Drive where his body was found, according to the Post and Courier.

Watson,
who also lived at the home, met Watson in April 2009 at the Heritage 
Golf Tournament in Hilton Head, according to her Facebook page.

The
accountant's social networking page is crammed with photographs of her 
taking trips - many with Hedrick - to destinations around the world, 
including Australia, Italy, Costa Rica and Peru.
