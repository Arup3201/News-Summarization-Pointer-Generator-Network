Ipswich striker Conor Sammon decided against copying Frank Lampard and celebrated with glee after scoring against former club Wigan.

Unlike Lampard, who stayed stony-faced after scoring for Manchester City against Chelsea on Sunday, Sammon rushed over to the Ipswich fans arms aloft after sealing a win that took Mick McCarthy's Tractor Boys up to seventh, only a point outside a play-off position.

The 27-year-old was roundly booed by the home fans who remembered he scored only once for them in 18 months after being brought down from Scotland by Roberto Martinez.

Meanwhile, Wigan boss Uwe Rosler must hope chairman Dave Whelan is more patient with him than Owen Coyle, who was sacked after a similarly poor start last season.

Wigan have declined steadily since winning the FA Cup at Wembley just over a year ago and started Monday night 17th in the Championship.

To try and stop the rot, manager Uwe Rosler gave home debuts to three deadline day signings; French striker Andy Delort, his former Brentford midfielder Adam Forshaw, and Danish international William Kvist, who has been capped 48 times by his country.

History was against visitors Ipswich who had never won at Wigan, but form was on their side after two consecutive victories, both with clean sheets.

Their hardy fans who'd made the 475-mile round trip for a Monday televised game had something to shout about when Daryl Murphy tested Scott Carson with a fierce drive and  Sammon headed narrowly wide as the visitors started as brightly as their orange shirts.

Their reward came after 20 minutes. David McGoldrick, who nearly joined Leicester City in the transfer window, crossed low from the left and Luke Hyam timed his run into the penalty area perfectly to convert from six yards. It was only the third goal of his career.

Shellshocked Wigan tried to rally and winger Callum McManaman, their best player when they won the FA Cup, was taken out by Christophe Berra as he sprinted down the flank to chase a quick equaliser. Berra was booked and McManaman had a not-so-friendly word in his ear once he'd got up.

The England under-21 international didn't fully recover and was replaced by James McClean after 36 minutes.

And Wigan felt further aggrieved when Shaun Maloney was knocked over by Tyrone Mings when advancing on goal, the defender receiving only a yellow card.

McCarthy and Rosler both had successful playing careers at Manchester City but it was the Wigan boss left feeling Blue when Forshaw failed to level with a 20-yard drive.

Ipswich then added a second after 64 minutes when Sammon raced onto McGoldrick's pass. Sammon hit Carson with his first effort but the ball ricocheted to him kindly so he could tap in the rebound from close range.

Ipswich's loan signing from Derby County Conor Sammon made his presence felt against Wigan Athletic

It was the striker's first goal for Ipswich since arriving on loan from Derby County in the summer.

Wigan threw themselves a lifeline after 83 minutes when James McClean's shot from 12 yards was turned in from close range by Martyn Waghorn, though the striker didn't know too about it as the ball struck him just above the knee.

Then, in a tense finale, Oriol Riera struck the post from eight yards as the home crowd rose to acclaim an equaliser.
