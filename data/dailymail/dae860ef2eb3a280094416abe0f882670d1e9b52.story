Michael Carrick could be forgiven for thinking that Manchester United’s season cost him his place at the World Cup — and there is some justification for that belief.

As someone involved in that extraordinary campaign, it’s safe to say it was a rollercoaster ride, and draining emotionally.

It’s a real shame for Carrick that one  side-effect was losing his place on the greatest stage. He was downbeat about the news — and I know because I was with him when he got the call to say he wasn’t going. Nemanja Vidic and I took him to the pub for a consolation drink.

Cost of failure: Michael Carrick paid the price for a poor season at Manchester United, says Rio Ferdinand

If anything, I was even more shocked than Carrick. If there is an obvious replacement then fine, but there isn’t. He’s been under-appreciated in an England shirt and never had the respect he deserves.

He’s the best holding midfielder England have. He knows the role. He’s not constantly wondering whether to stay or go because he plays it, week in, week out. But he’s not been utilised by the national managers, not given that run of eight, nine, 10 games over a sustained period to settle.

Unsettled is perhaps a good description of our club season. We weren’t playing well and those fluctuations in consistency take their toll. United fans rightly want success and it gets stressful for everyone when it’s elusive.

Shock to the system: Rio Ferdinand (L) admits the uncertainty surrounding David Moyes contributed to their woes

The pressure mounted. Questions started to be asked about David Moyes’s future as manager. That adds pressure all round. Who might he buy? Who would play? Was he even staying, or going?

We didn’t know. He didn’t know. After 27 years of Sir Alex Ferguson, that uncertainty was a shock at United.

It was always going to be a tough season. Moyes replacing Sir Alex has to be the toughest gig in football. You have to give Moyes some credit for his efforts but it was a tough year — and ultimately Carrick paid. I hope England don’t suffer now, too.
