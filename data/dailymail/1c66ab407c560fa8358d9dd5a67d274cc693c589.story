A lonely Australian widow who travelled half way across the world to find love has been found dead in suspicious circumstances in a rented villa in South Africa.

Family members had urged 67-year-old Jette Jacobs, from Wagin, West Australia, not to fly to Johannesburg to be with a Nigerian man she was having a relationship with on the internet.

She had already sent at least £50,000 to her Nigerian on-line lover, calling himself Jesse Orowo Omokoh, after meeting him on a dating website four years ago.

Two years ago Miss Jacobs travelled to South Africa to meet Omokoh and spent some time with him without incident. She vowed to return to Johannesburg to be with him again.

But now on that second visit her body has been found in her rented South African villa – and her money, credit cards, jewellery, laptop computer and other personal items have vanished.

As she planned her second trip, police in Western Australia sent Miss Jacobs a letter that she might be the victim of fraud – but the letter arrived at her home shortly after she had left Australia.

‘The circumstances of Miss Jacobs’ death are still being investigated, but there is evidence that it is suspicious,’ said Detective Senior Sergeant Dom Blackshaw of West Australia’s Major Fraud Squad.

Miss Jacobs’ son, who did not want to be named, told Sydney’s Daily Telegraph that her family and friends had tried to talk her out of making her second trip to meet the Nigerian, but she could not be dissuaded.

‘Mum went over for a couple of months and did not return,’ he said.

Urging others who ‘find love’ on the internet to be cautious, he added: ‘As you can see, one consequence of the internet scammers has taken her life.’

Miss Jacobs’ son said people who find what they think is love on the internet should not follow through with it.

‘Don’t go, because at the end of the day they are running a business or a scam or what they want to believe it is, to lure people to go to Africa…there’s a possibility it’s a one way ticket and no return.

‘If you do meet someone who is truly in love with you, money doesn’t buy it.’

Miss Jacobs, who had travelled to South Africa from her home in Wagin, 150 miles south east of Perth, had lost her husband in 2002 and her subsequent partner in 2009.

She was looking forward to meeting Omokoh again, but she received a message from him saying he could not get a visa to join her immediately.

Detective Blackshaw said there was evidence that Omokoh had arrived in Johannesburg two days before reporting her death and giving a statement to local police.

West Australian police run a warning website about relationship fraud that urges people not to respond to out-of-the-blue social media messages from strangers requesting romance, such as a friend request on Facebook.

Other warnings include:

Be wary of overseas-based singles, especially if they confess their love for you after a short amount of time or want to know about your financial status.

Remember that just because someone shares personal photos does not mean the pictures are of them - scammers often steal other people’s photos.

Alarm bells should ring if someone you do not know personally requests money, particularly by a wire transfer service…which could be going to an account set up with a stolen identity.
