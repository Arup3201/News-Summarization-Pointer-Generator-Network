It might seem like common sense that it’s better to make important decisions after you’ve eaten.

But a study has claimed the exact opposite - that we actually make better decisions on an empty stomach. 

Researchers found that people who were hungry made better snap decisions and could also appreciate future big rewards better than those who were fully fed.

Researchers at Utrecht University in The Netherlands say people make better decisions when they are hungry, including in activities such as gambling (stock image shown). In studies they found participants could better appreciate short and long rewards on an empty stomach

The research was carried out by scientists at Utrecht University in The Netherlands.

In the study participants were asked to fast for a night, and when they arrived at the laboratory the next day some were given food and some were not.

They were then given a variety of tasks to simulate decision making. 

In two of the three tasks participants took a psychological test known as the Iowa Gambling Task (IGT), which is said to simulate real-life decision making.

The Iowa Gambling Task (IGT) is a psychological test to simulate real-life decision making.

It is widely used in research of cognition and emotion.

In the IGT participants are presented with four virtual decks of cards on a computer screen.

Depending on the card drawn, some will win game money, some will lose money and some also carry a penalty.

Some of the decks are ‘bad decks’ and some are ‘good decks’, and it is down to the participant to work out which decks are best to selecting winning cards from.

By testing a group of participants the test can be used to show how certain factors affect decision making.

However, some critics of the IGT say it is not as accurate as thought.

The first study involved 30 university students participating in the IGT in exchange for money, while the second was similar but involved 50 students.

The results of these two studies indicated that people were better at making quick decisions while operating on an empty stomach

In the third study, which involved 46 students, the participants were presented with 27 questions requiring them to choose between being given a small amount of money in the present or a larger amount of money in the future.

In this study, the participants who had not eaten were more likely to choose the latter option, and vice-versa for those who had eaten. 

Overall it was found that the participants who were  hungry made more advantageous decisions in the task than those who had eaten.

Hungry people also had a better perception of future big rewards.

This suggests that making decisions in a ‘hot state’ is actually beneficial.

A 'hot state' is what psychologists call the moment when high levels of emotion can cause you to make quickly and sometimes irrational decisions.

The results challenge the thought that being hungry leads to rash decisions. This is known as a 'hot state', when emotions influence actions. The researchers say not eating (stock image shown) may actually allow us to make better decisions. And they also say quick decisions may not be as bad as thought

‘These studies for the first time provide evidence that hot states improve decision making under uncertain conditions, challenging the conventional conception of the detrimental role of impulsivity in decision making,’ the researchers write.

They conclude that the pre-conceived notion that people make irrational decisions on an empty stomach is not necessarily true.

‘It may be that hot states in general, and hunger and appetite in particular, do not necessarily make people more impulsive but rather make them rely more on their gut feeling which benefits complex decisions with uncertain outcomes,' they add.

‘Alternatively, it may be that hot states do increase impulsivity but that impulsivity is not necessarily bad.’
