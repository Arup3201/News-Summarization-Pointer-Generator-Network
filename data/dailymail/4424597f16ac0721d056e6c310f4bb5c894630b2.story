Fulham have had two bids rejected for Costa Rica World Cup defender Giancarlo Gonzalez.

The 26-year-old plays for Major League Soccer side Columbus Crew, but has become a target for the West London side after impressing at Brazil 2014.

Gonzalez played in every minute of Los Ticos' World Cup campaign, which saw the Central American outfit become the surprise team of the tournament as they bowed out in the quarter-finals, having taken Holland all the way in a penalty shootout.

The defender has 40 caps for his national side, and his experience is of interest to the Cottagers who are aiming to bounce back to the top flight having been relegated from the Premier League last term.

The defender has previously played in Europe, featuring in 37 games for Norwegian side Valerenga during the 2012-13 campaign.

Should Fulham be successful with a third offer, Gonzalez could become the club's tenth summer signing, joining a group of players including Ross McCormack who arrived from Leeds for £11million.
