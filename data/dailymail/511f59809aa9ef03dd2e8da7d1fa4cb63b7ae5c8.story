Saido Berahino is confident England will reach Euro 2015 by remaining cool under provocation in Croatia - as he edges closer to becoming the Under 21s all-time leading scorer.

The West Brom forward's late penalty on Friday gave England a 2-1 advantage to protect in the play-off second leg in Vinkovci on Tuesday night and was his 10th goals in 12 appearances at this level.

Alan Shearer and Francis Jeffers hold the record with 13 but if the Under 21s beat Croatia, Berahino would have plenty of chances to move out on his own.

‘Of course it is a target,’ said Berahino. ‘I have worked hard on my game. It is great that it is paying off and I am getting the rewards.’

The 21-year-old and the rest of England’s players are braced for intimidation on the pitch and hostility from the terraces.

Parallels have been drawn with the experience to which England were subjected in Serbia two years ago, when the black players in Stuart Pearce’s squad were racially abused and a brawl erupted as the home nation’s frustrations boiled over.

Croatia showed in Wolverhampton they can play rough but England staff have briefed the group about what to expect as they bid to reach the tournament in the Czech Republic.

‘We won’t worry about anything until it happens,’ said Berahino. ‘We are going to let the referee handle it and we won’t get involved. That is how we will qualify.

‘We will definitely need more of the character we showed on Friday. We have to go out and get goals. We are confident we can win the game.’
