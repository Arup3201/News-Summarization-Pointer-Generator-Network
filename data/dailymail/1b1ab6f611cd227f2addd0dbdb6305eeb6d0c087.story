When temperatures reaching a stifling 37 degrees, even these well-adapted tigers need to find a way of escaping the heat.

The beautiful big cats are pictured at the controversial Tiger Temple in Kanchanaburi, Thailand, where around 100 live alongside Buddhist monks.

Many were brought to the reserve as cubs and have grown up around humans. But even so these pictures show just how remarkably close these fearsome creatures can get to their keepers.

Chilling out: With temperatures soaring to more than 37 degrees in Thailand, the tiger sprawls out to make the best of the heat

An adult tiger is, at first, sprawled out on the ground sunbathing, but then cuddles up close to one of his fellow residents in the shade.

Elsewhere, a young tiger was spotted 
happily playing around in a pool of water with a fascinating new toy. 

Along with soaring temperatures, the humidity in Thailand can reach an exhausting 90 per cent in the summer months.

Founded in 1994, the Tiger Temple has 
attracted criticism from some wildlife groups who claim it is an illegal
 breeding facility and that the tigers are not sufficiently cared for. 

The first cub arrived in 1999 after her mother was killed by poachers nearby.

She
 died, but others have since arrived and the tiger population has 
gradually grown. The centre has become a tourist attraction where 
visitors can pay a fee to have their picture taken alongside the 
animals.

The organistion 
insists that it is a legitimate conservation centre, that the animals 
are well-cared for and that the aim is to release them back into the 
wild in the future.
