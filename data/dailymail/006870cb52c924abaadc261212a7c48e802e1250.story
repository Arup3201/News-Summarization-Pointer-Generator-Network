Cristiano Ronaldo picked up his third Ballon d'Or trophy on Monday night, beating Lionel Messi for the second year in a row.

Huge events like this gain much media attention, and users on social media were tuned in throughout the evening. Indeed, Ronaldo's name was trending long into the night.

One particular moment though, caught the imagination of Twitter users around the world.

Cristiano Ronaldo celebrates winning the Ballon d'Or for the second consecutive year with a loud scream

The Real Madrid star's shout perhaps looks less out of context after he has scored on a football pitch

As the Real Madrid maestro stepped up to the podium to collect his award, he let out a deep scream into the microphone, to the surprise of the watching millions.

Of course, Twitter exploded. Ronaldo later commented to Spanish television station Cuarto that the noise was part of a Real Madrid celebration.

He said: 'The scream? The players know I always do that shout when I score a goal or when we win - it's our team shout.'

But that didn't stop parody videos of the moment spreading across the globe. Here, Sportsmail have compiled the best of the bunch for your viewing pleasure.
