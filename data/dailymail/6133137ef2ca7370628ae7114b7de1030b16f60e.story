Scattered around Britain in secret bunkers, they were poised to strike fear into Hitler's troops had they reached the mainland.

The brave young men of the lethal Auxiliary Unit had been trained in the art of sabotage - from booby traps to 'time pencil' fuses.

Now, a collection of Second World War artefacts is up for auction which sheds light on the nation's secret last line of defence.

It includes cleverly disguised guides to bomb-making - hidden inside a calendar and fertiliser manual - which were used by the deadly wing of the civilian Home Guard.

The items for sale belonged to Louis 
Pugh, a chemical factory owner-turned-guerrilla fighter charged with 
heading the sabotage division of his local cell.

A collection of WWII artefacts from the deadly Auxiliary Unit wing of the Home Guard has come to light, including cleverly 
disguised manuals on bomb-making and sabotage. The manuals were disguised as calendars and fertiliser guides (above)

The items for sale belonged to Louis Pugh, a chemical factory owner-turned-guerrilla fighter charged with heading the sabotage division of his local cell of the Auxiliary Unit. The resistance division was the brainchild of Winston Churchill, who ordered a network of hidden bunkers to be set up around the country in case of invasion by Hitler's troops.

The Auxiliary Unit was the brainchild
of Winston Churchill, who ordered a network of hidden bunkers to be set
up around the country in case of invasion by Hitler’s troops.

The unit’s creation came after the Allies suffered heavy losses and had to be evacuated from Dunkirk in northern France in mid-1940.

Many of the concealed bases were in East Anglia, the most probable landing point for Hitler’s planned attack Operation Sealion.

Their very existence was on a strictly need-to-know basis and they were manned by only the most trusted members of the community.

The volunteer members were trained in guerrilla warfare as assassins and saboteurs with orders to attack from behind enemy lines should the Nazis invade.

Pugh (above) was one of six men based at a hideout at Gibbet Oak Farm in Tenterden, Kent. Hidden in woodland, it boasted a hydraulic entrance that had been fitted by the local garage owner

The artefacts are tipped to fetch a total of £3,000 when they go under the hammer next week. Above, Pugh's radio transmitter

Among Pugh's collection of mementos are manuals on how to make bombs using readily available chemicals and how to set booby traps

Members anticipated being shot if they were captured, and were expected to shoot themselves rather than be taken alive.

Thankfully, victory for the Allies in the Battle of Britain put paid to Hitler’s plans for invasion and the Auxiliary Unit were never called into action.

Amazingly, the unit’s existence only became public knowledge many years after the end of the war.

Pugh was one of six men based at a hideout at Gibbet Oak Farm in Tenterden, Kent.

Hidden in woodland, it boasted a hydraulic entrance that had been fitted by the local garage owner.

Pugh lived until 1984, and his secret role in the war only came to light when relatives discovered his possessions

Also for sale are Pugh's 1939-45 medal and defence medal. Other items include a silver pocket watch and compass

The patrol had to abandon the original site for the hideout when two courting lovers stumbled upon it.

After the Gibbet Oak Farm patrol was disbanded, Pugh joined the RAF, finishing the war as a Flight Lieutenant.

He lived until 1984, and his secret role in the war only came to light when relatives discovered his possessions.

Among Pugh’s collection of mementos are manuals on how to make bombs using readily available chemicals and how to set booby traps.

One manual is disguised as a calendar from 1937 while another is hidden inside a farming guide to fertilisers.

Also in the collection are two homemade incendiary bombs plus the Auxiliary Unit badge Pugh was awarded following the end of the war in 1945.

Among other items are his 1939-45 medal, defence medal, dog tags, a silver pocket watch, a compass and military dressings.

The artefacts are tipped to fetch a total of £3,000 when they go under the hammer.

Jeanette May, from auctioneers Eastbourne Auction Rooms, said: 'Churchill set up the little-known Auxiliary Unit in the run-up to the Battle of Britain as a secret part of the Home Guard.

'Fearing a German invasion, Churchill recruited the most trusted men in the community to form small bands of resistance fighters dotted around the country.

'The idea was that should the Germans invade, the Auxiliary Unit members would hide in their network of secret bunkers from where they could spring surprise attacks.

'The Auxiliary Unit members, usually young men, were trained in sabotage, fighting and bomb-making.

'They were like the SAS of the Home Guard.

'Louis Pugh ran the local chemicals factory and was so trusted he was made Head of Sabotage in a six-man patrol based at Gibbet Oak Farm in Tenterden.

'Originally, the patrol had been based at another secret location but their hideout had been stumbled upon by two courting lovers.

'While they were relocating, Louis had to take all the equipment back to his home, which was very worrying for him as he knew by doing so he was putting his family in danger.

'The possessions from his time in the unit are fascinating.

'Among the highlights are two secret manuals on how to make bombs and booby traps plus the radio receiver and telephone from the base.

'With much of the fighting taking place in Europe it’s easy to forget the brave people who stayed at home to defend their country.

'We expect there to be plenty of interest in these artefacts.'

The auction will take place at Eastbourne Auction Rooms in East Sussex on October 24.
