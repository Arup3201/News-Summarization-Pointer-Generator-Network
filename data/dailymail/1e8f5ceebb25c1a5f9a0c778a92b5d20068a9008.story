String bends, tapping, vibrato and whammy bars are all techniques that add to the distinctiveness of a lead guitarist's sound, whether it's Clapton, Hendrix, or BB King.

Now guitarist and physicist Dr David Robert Grimes has described the physics underlying these techniques in the journal Plos One.

And, he says, using his methods guitar players can improve their technique and become better musicians.

There have been plenty of songs written about spiders and their webs, and now scientists have found the creatures are musical in their own right.

Using lasers, researchers found spiders pluck their complex constructions like guitar strings to gather information about their surroundings.

Spider silk transmits vibrations across a wide range of frequencies so that when a thread is plucked, the sound created carries information about prey, mates, and even the structural integrity of a web.

The discovery was made by researchers from the universities of Oxford, Strathclyde, and Sheffield who fired bullets and lasers at spider silk to study how it vibrates.

They found that spider silk can be tuned to a wide range of harmonics.

'Very good guitarists will manipulate 
the strings to make the instrument sing,' explains Dr Grimes.

'On a 
piano, you've got the 12 chromatic notes in a scale. On a guitar, you 
can bend the strings to get the notes in between.

'I wanted to understand
 what it was about these guitar techniques that allows you to manipulate
 pitch.'

Dr Grimes is a postdoctoral researcher in Oxford University's Department of Oncology, and normally spends his time working on mathematical models of oxygen distribution in order to improve radiotherapy in the treatment of cancer.

But he is also a keen guitarist, and has been a session musician and member of a band in Dublin in the past.

In spare time at his previous position at Dublin City University and now at Oxford University, he worked out the physics behind the instinctive playing of the best guitarists.

Dr Grimes derived equations describing how string bending, vibrato and whammy bars change the pitch of a note.

He found that the properties of the strings had a big effect on the change in pitch - in particular the Young's modulus (a measure of how much the string stretches under force) and how thick the strings are.

This is one of the equations derived by Dr Grimes. He tells MailOnline it explains the bending of a note: 'It says that the pitch is related to the length of the vibrating string length, the angle you bend it through, the tension of the string T, the area of the string A and finally the Young's modulus of the string E'

He also worked out how easy hammer-ons and pull-offs are, depending on the height of the guitar strings above the finger board.

Finally, he confirmed the equation for string bends experimentally, measuring the frequency of the sound produced for strings bent through different angles on a guitar.

'I took one of my oldest guitars down to the engineering lab at Dublin City University to one of the people I knew there and explained that I wanted to strip it down to do this experiment,' explains Dr Grimes.

'We had to accurately bend the strings to different extents and measure the frequency produced.

'He was a musician too and looked at me with abject horror. But we both knew it needed to be done - we put some nails into my guitar for science.'

The physics of vibrating strings and string instruments has been long understood, but no one has previously worked out how effects like bending the string change the pitch of the sound.

Another unknown was pitch depends on the tension of the string, the force applied, and the angle through which it is bent.

'It turns out it's actually reasonably straightforward,' says Dr Grimes.

'It's an experiment a decent physics undergraduate could do, and a cool way of studying some basic physics principles.

'It's also potentially useful to string manufacturers and digital instrument modellers.'
