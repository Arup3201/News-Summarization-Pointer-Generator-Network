A U.S. emigre, Daniel Pomerantz, on Tuesday launched the first Hebrew language edition of the popular men's magazine.Â 

Playboy has been widely available in Israel for years, but this marks the first local edition of the magazine. It features Israeli models and articles by Israeli writers.

It's not clear how well the magazine will be received in the Holy Land, where religious sensitivities simmer under the surface and observant Jews and Muslims live by strict modesty rules.

A Hebrew edition of adult magazine has been launched in religiously-conservative Israel and will feature local models

Adult magazines and videos are freely available, but not with local models and not in Hebrew.

Playboy was launched in 1953 with the iconic Marilyn Monroe centerfold. It peaked in popularity in the 1970's. Circulation has declined since the rise of adult Internet sites.

It is not the first time the magazine has faced anger from the religious community.

In August Playboy featured the first Indian woman to pose naked for the magazine, incurring anger from the country's moral guardians.

Small-time Bollywood actress Sherlyn Chopra, 28, says she is proud to have pushed the envelope in a country where public nudity in any form remains largely a taboo.

Playboy, along with a host of other foreign adult magazines, is banned in the country.

'I had no apprehensions and have no regrets; just feelings of pure liberation and sheer excitement,' she said of the Playboy shoot in Los Angeles.
