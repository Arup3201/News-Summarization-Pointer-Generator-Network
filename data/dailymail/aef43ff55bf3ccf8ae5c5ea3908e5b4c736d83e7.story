A group of Danish teenagers filmed a boy and a girl posing as a boyfriend abusing his partner to see if ‘the man on the street’ would intervene.

The experiment follows on from the viral video showing a freezing boy at a Norwegian bus stop where a majority of people offered up their clothes for the shivering child.

However, the Danish were not as kind as their Scandinavian neighbours when it came to a young woman being subjected to threats and violence.

Social experiment: Two Danish teenagers staged domestic abuse on the streets and in the parks of Copenhagen to see if people would intervene - the results were disappointing

The four-minute video was shot around Copenhagen by local 18-year-olds Arian Kashef and Emil Behrndtz on Valentine’s Day.

Mr Kashef was filmed in several locations, in a park and on busy streets, pretending to mentally and pysically abuse their friend Soraya, posing as his ’girlfriend’.

Shockingly, it is not until a minute into the video that a lone man interrupts the experiment when se sees Mr Kashef grabbing and slapping his ‘partner’ on a park bench.

Before this, a group of young women, stronger than Mr Kashef in numbers, are filmed walking past the ‘arguing couple', and although they look, they do nothing.

In the video, Mr Kashef can be heard shouting things such as ‘You know what you've done!’, I’m going to kill you!’ and ‘Are you not listening to what I’m telling you?!’ while also being physically abusive against his pretend partner.

Shocking: The young woman to the left has just unlocked her bike from right behind the 'arguing couple', but does nothing to stop the abuse

Exposing the truth: Arian Kashef and Emil Behrndtz, both 18, filmed the video on Valentine's Day where Mr Kashef pretended to abuse his 'girlfriend', a friend of theirs, in public

In the description on their YouTube page the pair explains:

‘This experiment was filmed on Valentine’s Day as this day represents love between two people.

‘Unfortunately, not all live in a healthy relationship, but rather one in which they are subjected to violence.

‘We wanted to see how people here in Denmark would react to a young lady being threatened and subjected to physical violence.’

Mr Kashef who runs YouTube channel ArianPlanet with Mr Behrndtz, said a majority of people who stopped him were women.

‘A quarter of witnesses helped out, a majority of which were younger women,’ Mr Kashef told MailOnline.

‘There were also a lot of older women who said something, but did not physically confront me, which is understandable.

‘I don't think this behaviour is specific for Denmark, I think people across Western society are scared of taking responsibility.

‘Personally I think we have a responsibility to stop this, like myself and Emil Behrndtz for example, we are just two teenagers who do these videos for no financial benefit, just in hope of changing the way people think.’

Hero: A lone man intervenes in a park, and pushes the 'boyfriend' away from the girl

Faith restored: A witness walks in between the pair to stop the pretend abuse

The pair were disappointed that so few intervened and shocked that a majority of people simply walked past, doing nothing.

This
 includes the jawdropping moment towards the end when a woman towards 
the end when the pair are arguing in front of a row of parked bikes, who
 unlocks her bike next to the arguing pair and almost has to nudge them 
out of the way to get it out.

Earlier in the video, Mr Kashef subjects Soraya to physical and verbal abuse next to two people sitting on a bench who do not even appear to acknowledge the fighting ‘couple’.

‘I grew up with women and have a huge respect for them and staged this experiment to see how people would react,’ Mr Kashef told MetroExpress.

‘I wanted to see if, for example, my little sister can feel safe on the street in that situation.

 ‘It was disappointing to see so few intervene and so many people just walk past, including grown men.

‘I was standing there saying “I’m going to kill you,’ and two girls next to us just hurried off. Is it really going to take a black eye for people to react?’
