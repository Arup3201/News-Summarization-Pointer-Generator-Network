Warning: Former Home Secreatry Jacui Smith said Labour had to start telling voters what they would do

Ed Miliband’s plans to overhaul Labour party policy has been ridiculed as late and empty.

Former home secretary Jacqui Smith has said she worries Labour's policy review resembles a pregnant panda - a long time in the making but with no-one sure if there is anything in there.

It was a reference to giant panda Tian Tian, who is thought could give birth at Edinburgh Zoo soon but keepers are not certain she is even expecting.

Mr Miliband’s infamous ‘black sheet’ policy review was ordered in September 2010, but three years later there has been little detail confirmed.

Instead the review has been delayed several times, with aides to the Labour leader insisting he will not be rushed into writing his election manifesto.

However Miss Smith, who lost her seat at the last election, said it was time for Mr Miliband to start putting ‘flesh on the bones’.

She said eye-catching policies need to emerge at next week's Labour Party conference as she analysed how the gathering will help the opposition win the 2015 general election.

Writing for New Labour pressure group Progress, Ms Smith said: ‘August is never going to be the time to outline major future policy initiatives - that has to be at conference.

‘I sometimes worry that our policy review resembles a pregnant panda - it's been a very long time in the making and no one's quite sure if there's anything in there anyway.

‘At this conference, some eye-catching policies need to break out of the conference centre and resonate more widely.

‘Ed Miliband has the tough job of following last year's brilliant speech with the next instalment fleshing out his character and beliefs and telling people about the country he wants to lead and how Labour can deliver it.

‘Couple that with some lively media performances from the excellent shadow cabinet in support, some strong policy announcements to exemplify the overall direction and resisting the temptation to air any internal angst in public - and those of us who aren't making the trip to Brighton might just sit up and take note.’

Pressure: Ed Miliband is expected to start outlining key Labour policies at the party conference in Brighton next week

The former MP believes leader Ed Miliband faces a tough job to follow his ‘brilliant’ speech last year, with the next part ‘fleshing out his character and beliefs’, telling people about the country he wants to lead and how Labour can deliver it.

Resisting the temptation to air any ‘internal angst’ in public combined with strong policy announcements, lively media performances and shadow cabinet support might make people sit up and take note, Ms Smith adds.

Ms Smith, who says she will not attend the conference in Brighton, said the party should avoid getting into a debate about coalition because it has a realistic chance of forming a majority government.
