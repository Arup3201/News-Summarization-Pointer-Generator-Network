Suddenly it feels a little like Springtime in women’s tennis, that the game might be starting to bloom again after a long spell spent in the the long shadow cast by their male counterparts.

It seems we may be arriving at a point in the cycle when renewal is setting in with some exciting new blood about to reinvigorate what has remained, despite a relative lack of stars in recent years, a hugely successful form of women’s sport.

Over on the men’s tour you sense a slight trepidation about how things will be when, inevitably, the golden generation of present starts to fade away in the next few years.

Not so with their female counterparts, which is welcoming an assortment of new names and personalities who are going to challenge for the highest honours, quite possibly as soon as this Wimbledon.

It was a huge blow for women’s tennis that as intriguing a figure as Marion Bartoli immediately retired after last year’s Championships, going the same way as marquee figures such as Kim Clijsters and Justine Henin, who have been hard to replace.

There are a host of relative newcomers to look out for this year with different playing styles and blessedly barely a grunt between them. While not all will make it to the very top, some are sure to go all the way in the next few years.

And, unlike in the men’s game, a healthy handful of the brightest represent what is still the game’s key market, North America. Canada has the startlingly grown-up Eugenie Bouchard while America has the long identified Sloane Stephens, the fresh new talent of teenager Taylor Townsend and the player who some cognoscenti feel could be the best of all, Eastbourne champion Madison Keys.

Bouchard excelled at the recent French Open, as did beaten finalist Simona Halep of Romania and the athletic Spanish-Venezuelan Garbine Muguruza. France’s Caroline Garcia is another of whom great things have been predicted and we might be saying the same of  Laura Robson, if only she could manage a sustained spell free of injuries.

Opportunities will be coming with the top two seeds – Serena Williams and Li Na –  both 32, while there is plenty of mileage on the clock already for Maria Sharapova, despite her being only 27.

Bartoli was the second surprise Wimbledon champion in three years, after the triumph of Petra Kvitova in 2011. Eight of the last fourteen Grand Slams have been won by different women, a situation that contrasts sharply with the locked-out men’s game - only six on the victor’s podium from the last 37 Majors.

The most dominant player has been the younger Williams sister and there is no question that her best level is still superior to anyone, even Sharapova, who she could meet in the quarter finals in the tougher top half of the draw.

However there are signs that the surge she has enjoyed following her 30th birthday, which coincided with her hooking up with French coach Patrick Mouratoglou, may be running out of momentum.

In three of the last four Majors she has gone out of the fourth round or earlier, having won three out of the four that preceded them. Perhaps it has been physical or a fractional drop in motivation –  quite understandable as, like her almost direct contemporary Roger Federer, she approaches her 33rd birthday.

The tendency to implode is making the biggest titles harder to come by, and serves only to encourage the others. As one leading coach observed of her: 'Sometimes it seems as if she cannot really beat up an opponent then she gets frustrated and is not prepared to hang in there like she used to.'

Last year saw some rare carnage in the women’s draw with many of the big names struggling with their footwork early on. By the time we got to the semi-finals the players left were ranked 4 (Agnieszka Radwanska) 15 (Bartoli), 20 (Kirsten Flipkens) and 23 (Sabine Lisicki).

The weather has been warmer and drier in this year’s build up and this may add up to more assured performances from the top eight seeds. Any slips ups this time and there is a queue formed of the younger generation itching to take advantage.

1. CHARLOTTE DOD (1887)

The youngest ever ladies singles champion, ‘Lottie’ won the title aged 15.

2. MARTINA HINGIS (1997)

At 16, the youngest Wimbledon singles champion in the modern era. Also the youngest ever winner of the girls title, aged 13.

3. MARIA SHARAPOVA (2004)

The 17-year-old Sharapova beat Serena Williams in the final. Bouchard remembers watching that day: ‘I thought what she was doing was so cool, and I wanted to do the same thing.’

4. VENUS WILLIAMS (2000)

A 20-year old Williams dropped only one set on the way to the first of her five Wimbledon crowns.

5. STEFFI GRAF (1988)
