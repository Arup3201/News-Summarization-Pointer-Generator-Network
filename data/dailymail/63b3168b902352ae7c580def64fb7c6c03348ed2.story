A woman has had to be treated in hospital after she was attacked by a bat in Northern Territory.

Debbie 'Hammie' Riley, 55, was walking near Roper River when a bat flew straight at her and believed to have latched on to her leg.

'I heard something drop on the roof and the next thing I know there was a bat just aiming for me through the sky and he just bit on to me,” Ms Riley told NT News.

'It’s wings were flapping and he peed all over me and when I looked down all I could see were its eyes. I grabbed its wing and yanked it off.'

Ms Riley was treated for tetanus, rabies and lyssavirus, which included painful injections directly into the wounds on her leg and fingers when the incident occured on August 19.

'I just want people to be aware of what to do. Wash the wound for five minutes and then apply antiseptic and get medical treatment as soon as possible,' she said.

'Even if it’s the tiniest bite, if it draws blood it needs attention. These disgusting things carry lyssavirus and rabies it also affects you mentally.'
