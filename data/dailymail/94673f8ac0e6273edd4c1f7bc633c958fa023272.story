A state of emergency has been declared in the Galápagos Islands after a ship ran aground nearby last week.

The ship, called the Floreana, had been carrying food and other supplies - including some potentially polluting liquids and 45,000 litres (10,000 gallons) of fuel.

For now the ship remains in one piece, but officials are working to remove its fuel in case it splits and spills into the surrounding waters.

Speaking to the Wall Street Journal, some scientists warned there could be some impact on the area if the ship broke apart.

'Naufragio is a bay with great biological diversity,' Dr Carlos Valle, a professor at Universidad San Francisco de Quito, told the Wall Street Journal.

'There is a potential risk of its being affected, especially for very large colonies of sea lions and invertebrate species from the coast.'

Officials were keen to downplay the risk of danger to the surrounding area, saying that the 'greatest danger has passed.'

Nonetheless, they are still in the process of removing all the fuel from the ship, with about 12 per cent still left on board.

Ecuador declared the state of emergency on Wedesnday, and the alert 'will allow authorities to have immediate (financial) means to deal with the situation,' a Galapagos National Park spokesman told AFP.

This was amid fears the boat poses an imminent risk to the fragile ecosystem of the Unesco World Heritage Site.

Located some 1,000 kilometers (620 miles) off Ecuador's Pacific coast, the Galapagos are famed for the large number of species that have developed there in isolation, such as giant tortoises (shown)

On January 28, the ship Floreana, which runs supplies to the Galapagos, ran aground at Puerto Baquerizo Moreno.

It was carrying 1,400 tons of cargo, including food and hazardous substances, as well as some 10,000 gallons (45,000 litres) of fuel.

There has been some leakage into the pristine waters but that has been controlled by booms.

Meanwhile the ship, whose hull was destroyed, is in the process of being refloated and removed.

It is at least the third such incident in the past year at the islands.

This is the third time a ship has run aground in the Galapagos in the last year, including Galapaface I in May 2014, which was stranded for more than a month.
