The temporary installation of new outdoor urinals along a party street has been met with revolt.

For more than 10 years, Gold Coast City Council has been trying to manage public urination in Surfers Paradise's busy nightclub strip and hope these portable toilets will be the answer.

The loos are aimed at longtime perpetrators - believed to be drunken men - who have been relieving themselves in front of businesses and alleyways, one councillor told Daily Mail Australia.

But when two blocks of portable urinals were put up on Friday night, locals were 'disgusted' and 'offended' by what they could see.

Three blocks of portable urinals were put up in Surfers Paradise on Friday night as part of a one week trial by Gold Coast City Council

Council says they are trying to find ways to deter drunken men from urinating in front of shops and alleyways

Councillor Lex Bell says public urination along Cavill Mall and Orchid Avenue in Surfers Paradise, southeastern Queensland, has been an issue for 10 to 12 years.

'We've had drunk people urinating in shop fronts, on windows and all over footpaths for a long time now,' he told Daily Mail Australia.

'I don't like the urinals either but they're are less offensive than the alternative.

'These urinals are just a way for us to manage the problem as council simply doesn't have the power to arrest people who urinate in public.' 

To deter drunken men from having a tinkle in inappropriate places, council put up two blocks of portable loos on Friday night.

The podiums are designed so up to three men are able to use them at the same time.

But since they were installed, council have been receiving public backlash from Gold Coast locals.

Among them include Richard Holliday who took to social media to express his detestation for the public conveniences.

'Merry Christmas from Surfers Paradise. Disgusting public loos greet millions of visitors and residents,' he tweeted on Tuesday.

'At every level they are grossly wrong.' 

Cr Bell says many are also concerned about the design of the loos.

'They have modesty panels but I don't think they're big enough so tomorrow we're installing bigger shields which will approach the full body length,' he said.

'The urinals will only be operating between midnight and dawn so during other times they will be locked so people can't use them.'

The toilets are on a one week trial and will be reviewed by council after December 26.

Cr Bell says it's too early to judge whether the urinals have been successful. 

'It's a seasonal issue for us, obviously becoming worse during this time of year,' he said.

'So Boxing Day will be the big test.'
