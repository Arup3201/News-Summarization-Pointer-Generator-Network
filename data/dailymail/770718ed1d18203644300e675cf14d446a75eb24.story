France lurched closer to recession yesterday as a dramatic slump in output dented President François Hollande’s hopes of reviving the flagging economy.

A report showed French businesses have suffered their worst month in nearly three-and-a-half years, plunging the eurozone’s second largest economy into turmoil.

The decline in France was echoed across the region and piled pressure on European leaders to get a grip on the single currency debt crisis.

Problems: Economists suggested that the downbeat picture from France, showed that unemployment running a 13-year high and a raft of tax rises announced by Socialist President Francois Hollande may be weighing on activity

Ben May, a European economist at the 
research group Capital Economics, said: ‘There is little here to alter 
the view that the eurozone recession looks set to deepen in the latter 
part of the year.’

Mr Hollande, a Socialist, swept to 
power in May promising to reverse austerity, but his popularity has 
tumbled as  the economy has flatlined.

The government is due to outline spending cuts and tax rises worth around £25billion next week.

These are likely to include a 75 per 
cent rate of tax on those earning more than £800,000 – a move that 
threatens to drive many French wealth creators overseas.

The measures may not be enough to cut
the deficit from 4.5 per cent of gross domestic product this year to 3 
per cent next year, forcing Mr Hollande to consider even deeper cuts.

The closely watched purchasing 
managers’ index of activity in France – where a number below 50 
represents decline – fell from 48 in August to a 41-month low of 44.1 
this month.

It was the seventh month in a row 
when the number has been below 50 and suggested the French economy could
shrink by 0.6 per cent in the current third quarter of the year.

That follows nine months of zero growth.

At the same time, the Italian 
government said yesterday it expected its economy would shrink by 2.4 
per cent this year, double its earlier projections.

Shrinking: The data suggested that France's 2 trillion euro economy, which posted zero growth in the last nine months, could shrink by as much as 0.5-0.6 percent in the third quarter, said Markit Chief Economist Chris Williamson

For 2013, Italy now expects its economy to contract by 0.2 per cent, after earlier predictions of 0.5 per cent growth.

It came against the backdrop of better-than-expected PMI figures from Germany. 

During European morning trade, the 
EURO STOXX 50 declined 0.53 per cent, France’s CAC 40 slumped 0.51 per 
cent, while Germany’s DAX 30 dropped 0.30 per cent.

The Markit/CDAF flash composite 
purchasing manager's index (PMI), a preliminary estimate of firms' 
activity that covers both manufacturing and services, slid to 44.1 in 
September, its lowest level in 41 months, from 48.0 in August.

It
was seventh consecutive month that the composite indicator remained 
below the 50-point threshold separating a contraction in activity from 
expansion.

'France is really starting to struggle quite substantially,' said Markit Chief Economist Chris Williamson.

'Its
economy is suffering as its neighbours are seeing demand weaken and ...
there are few signs of demand to stimulate growth in France.'

The
data suggested that France's 2 trillion euro economy, which posted zero
growth in the last nine months, could shrink by as much as 0.5-0.6 
percent in the third quarter, he said.

September's
gloomy outlook came despite positive news flow on the euro zone crisis,
including the announcement of the European Central Bank's bond-buying 
programme that lifted stock markets.

'It may be too early for the good news to have filtered through,' Williamson said.

'But the fact that businesses grew gloomier is a big concern.'

Business orders, which had slowed the pace of their contraction in recent months, fell at the fastest rate in 3-1/2-years as both weak final demand and uncertainty weighed.

Hollande has made reviving France's stalled economy a priority since he took office in May but his efforts have been hampered by a wave of layoffs from companies including retailer Carrefour (CARR.PA) and car maker Peugeot (PEUP.PA).

After 7.2 billion euros in tax rises this year, Hollande has already indicated he will hike levies on households and businesses by much more in 2013 in an effort to trim France's public deficit to 3 percent of GDP.

"It could be that French-specific factors have played a role, with the upcoming fiscal consolidation of more than 30 billion euros next year likely having made consumers as well as producers reluctant to spend, hitting activity," said ABN Amro economist Joost Beaumont.

High international energy and commodity costs pushed input prices higher, while weak demand meant that output prices continued to fall, forcing companies to accept smaller profit margins.

"Investment will be hurt, as will unemployment. Companies will be moving further into cost cutting," Williamson said.

Layoffs accelerated to the fastest rate in 34 months, with manufacturers and service providers both recording steeper falls in payrolls as work backlogs declined.

The contraction in activity was most severe in the manufacturing sector, which is more exposed to the weak international outlook.

Activity here fell for the seventh consecutive month, sinking to a 41-month low of 42.6.

Overall new manufacturing orders fell more sharply than export orders, suggesting that deteriorating domestic demand was mostly to blame.

Household consumption, the motor of France's economy, is closely linked to unemployment, which is running at more than 10 percent.

Service activity, meanwhile, worsened for a second straight month, sliding to a four-month low of 46.1, from 49.2 in August.

Service providers' business expectations, which had improved sharply in August, slid back into negative territory in September for the first time since February 2009.

The indices for outstanding business and new business in the services sector were also sharply weaker.
