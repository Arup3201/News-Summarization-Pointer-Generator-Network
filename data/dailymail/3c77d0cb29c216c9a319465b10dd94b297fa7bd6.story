Women giving evidence in court should not be allowed to hide behind the veil, one of the country’s most senior judges said yesterday.

Baroness Hale said judges should be able to insist that women reveal their faces to juries when necessary.

She said she had come to the conclusion after ordering a mother in a family court case to remove her veil – when she realised the woman had been lying.

Lady Hale said: ‘We should devise ways of making it possible and insisting people show their full face when it is necessary. There must come a point where we can insist.’ 

The deputy president of the Supreme Court has spoken out after a decade of controversy over whether Muslim witnesses and lawyers should be allowed to keep their faces covered in the courtroom.

Despite a promise last year from the Lord Chief Justice, Lord Thomas, of a public consultation and clear new rules, the senior judiciary has been stalling, leaving judges and magistrates to decide for themselves what to do on a case-by-case basis.

Taking up the issue, Lady Hale said: ‘We don’t object to allowing people to do things for sincerely held religious reasons if they don’t do any harm. If it does harm, we have to be a bit tougher.’

Recalling her own experience, she told how a mother in a family case arrived at court in ‘full purdah’. 

‘In that particular case it really was very obvious both that she loved her children fantastically and that there were occasions when she was lying,’ Lady Hale said.

‘I don’t think it would have been as obvious if I had only been able to see her eyes.

‘There are other situations, not only giving evidence, when it is necessary to be able to recognise people and identify people. If it is necessary to see their face, then ways have got to be found to allow that to happen.’

A number of senior figures, including former Justice Secretary Kenneth Clarke, have made it clear that they believe judges should be able to insist that a witness remove a veil.

The Lord Chief Justice has said that it is the responsibility of the senior judiciary to give guidance, and last year promised a public consultation ‘in the very near future’.

Dawson's barrister Susan Meek had successfully argued at a pre-trial hearing that her client had a right to wear the niqab in court 

Lord Thomas and fellow senior judges had been waiting for the European Court of Human Rights to give a view on French laws which ban the wearing of the burka or niqab in public places.

The Strasbourg judges ruled in July that the French ban was justified in the cause of social cohesion. However, the consultation has not materialised. 

Lord Thomas said last month: ‘We have not got back to taking it into account, but I would hope to be able to do so as soon as is reasonably practicable.’ He explained that other, more pressing issues had come to the fore, adding: ‘There have been, one might say, some other problems but not that one.’

One case in which the veil was an issue was the trial in January of Muslim convert Rebekah Dawson at Blackfriars Crown Court in London.

She refused to remove her niqab to give evidence in her trial for witness intimidation despite the demands of the judge.

Eventually she chose not to go into the witness box, claiming it was against her religious beliefs to show her face to men. Later she was jailed for six months after changing her plea to guilty.

Lady Hale also spoke out on the issue of divorce in an interview with the Evening Standard, joining a list of senior judges calling for measures to make the process easier for families.

Previously she proposed no-fault divorce laws when she was head of the Law Commission in the 1990s. John Major’s government adopted her plans, but the scheme proved unworkable and the idea was dropped by Tony Blair.

Reviving the issue, she said: ‘You would make a declaration that your marriage had irretrievably broken down and if you were still of that view a year later, then you get your divorce.’

The most senior family law judge, Sir James Munby, has called for couples to be allowed to register a divorce at a register office without the involvement of the courts.
