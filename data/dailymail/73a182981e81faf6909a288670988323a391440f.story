Ashya King's brain cancer treatment will start next week after a series of successful tests at Prague's Proton Therapy Centre today.  

The five-year-old's father Brett admitted that his unwell son 'will be scared' but his mother Naghmeh will be there to hold his hand and both have 'every confidence' Czech doctors will cure him.

Ashya was flown by private jet from Spain to Prague, where he is expected to start pioneering treatment for his brain tumour next week after being monitored by experts today.

Good news: Ashya King leaves the Prague clinic this afternoon clutching a teddy  bear after a day of tests that mean his cancer treatment can start next week

Brett King, father of the five-year-old Ashya King, spoke today and believes that the care his son will receive abroad will save him

Doctors  warned Mr King that his son will suffer headache-like-pain as he inspected the proton beam machine that will treat him.

He said: 'I'm so happy we can finally bring Ashya here. It is incredible, I have every confidence in it.

'It is daunting and Ashya will be scared but his mother will be holding his hand.' 

With his devoted parents by his side, Ashya King finally arrived at hospital in the Czech Republic yesterday – as his father declared: ‘It’s all worthwhile – he will get better.’

Just days ago, his parents were in a Spanish prison cell after being arrested for removing the youngster from an NHS hospital in Southampton without doctors’ permission and taking him abroad. 

But following a public outcry, the couple were released and reunited with their son, before being allowed to transfer him to Prague for the proton beam therapy treatment they desperately want for him. 

In a statement, the Proton Therapy Centre said: 'If all goes well and the physicists will be able to prepare Ashya's irradiation plan in four days already instead of standard 10 days, he will start the first irradiation on Monday

'His plan takes 30 irradiation visits and is combined with chemotherapy.

'The chemotherapy will be applied by specialised oncologists at Motol University Hospital, where Ashya is hospitalised with his mother.'

Love: Brett King gives his son a kiss ahead of crucial tests to determine what care he can receive

As Ashya was stretchered from the ambulance yesterday, his father Brett, 51, said: ‘It’s amazing, I’m excited. Power to the people.

‘When you see my son you see why the whole thing we’ve been through has been worthwhile to get him better. He will get better.’

Ashya’s mother Naghmeh, 45, added: ‘I’m so happy to be here.’

Their emotional arrival came as it emerged Ashya’s treatment is expected to cost up to £70,000 – and could be paid for by the NHS. 

Miloslav Ludvik of the Motol University Hospital – where Ashya will stay while he is treated at the Proton Therapy Centre – said it was a ‘good question’ who would foot the bill. 

He said: ‘We are not concerned about the financial issues at the moment, what matters is treating the child. 

Parents Brett, 51, and Naghmeh, 45,  were reunited with their son after 72 hours in jail and later dramatically granted permission by a High Court judge to allow Ashya to undergo proton therapy in Eastern Europe

'But there are three options for payment eventually. Either the parents will pay, or the NHS will pay under new EU regulations or the parents will pay and then take the bill to the NHS for reimbursement.’

The NHS funds proton beam therapy abroad ‘whenever it is considered clinically appropriate’. 

However, NHS England does not fund proton therapy for medulloblastoma – the cancer that Ashya has – because of concern that patients not fit enough to travel would be delayed from receiving radiotherapy and subsequently have a reduced chance of a cure. 

Last year 99 children were fully funded by the NHS to go abroad for proton beam therapy.

One method of funding is the S2, an arrangement between the NHS and the state healthcare provider in the EU country patients are visiting, which requires prior approval.

A spokesman for University Hospital Southampton NHS Foundation Trust said: ‘It is good news that Ashya’s treatment can be resumed without delay and we are delighted for him that the situation has now been resolved.’

Ashya is expected to be taken to the Proton Therapy Centre today for assessment, and if all goes well a six-week treatment programme will start next there on Monday.

British paediatricians who treated Ashya have insisted that proton therapy is not suitable for his type of tumour. They want him to receive conventional radiotherapy. 

After being taken from Britain to Spain and then being isolated from his parents and family, Ashya King arrived in Prague for cancer treatment yesterday

The couple stroke young Ashya's head as they arrive in Prague yesterday. The five-year-old's mother said she was 'so happy' to be in the Czech Republic  

The family travelled on a private jet from Malaga to Prague after being released from prison where they spent 72 hours 

An ambulance carrying the child arrives at the centre where Ashya's treatment is expected to cost £70,000 

The five-year-old's mother Naghmeh accompanied him on both ambulance journeys in Spain and the Czech Republic

Ashya's parents removed him from Southampton hospital on August 28 without doctors' consent 

The £30million Proton Therapy Centre where Ashya King is to be treated boasts state of the art cancer-fighting technology.

Built in 2012, the gleaming white lobby of the five-storey building on the outskirts of Prague appears more like a modern hotel – complete with an 18ft tropical fish tank and red sofas.

The centre says its treatment is more accurate than conventional radiotherapy because proton beams stop once they reach their target. For brain tumours, this reduces the radiation doses to other parts of the body by 60 per cent and halves the risk of secondary tumours, staff claim.

A course of treatment takes from five to 30 visits. Sessions never last more than 30 minutes.
