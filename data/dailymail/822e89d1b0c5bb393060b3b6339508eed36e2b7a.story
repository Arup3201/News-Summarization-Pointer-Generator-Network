The daughter of Rolf Harris broke down yesterday as she described confronting her father about his affair with a teenager, telling him: ‘How could you? It’s my best friend.’

Bindi Nicholls said she went into a ‘head rush’ after hearing about the entertainer’s long-running relationship with her inseparable childhood playmate.

‘It was just horrible, It felt like the whole world had changed in an instant,’ she told Southwark Crown Court in London.

Rolf Harris's daughter Bindi (left) said her father, Rolf (centre, with wife Alwen Hughes) could not have assaulted her teenage friend in the 1970s

‘I immediately went into “My dad’s a 
b******, my friend’s a saint” type of thing. I rang him up and said, 
“What on earth has happened here, you have had an affair with my friend,
 how dare you, how could you, it’s my best friend”.

‘I was just so angry with him... He said, “Sorry, sorry love, I’m so sorry”.’

She
 later became suicidal and began hitting her head against a wall and 
wanted to stab herself, the court heard.

Taking the stand, Miss 
Nicholls, 50, also told the court of her home life with the entertainer,
 saying he ‘didn’t take much notice’ of her.

And she told the jury how she feared the stress of the trial might kill her parents, who are in their 80s.

Harris
 is accused of subjecting his daughter’s friend to a 16-year campaign of
 abuse which started when she was 13 while on holiday with his family in
 Hawaii in 1978. The 84-year-old star denies molesting her, but says 
they had a consensual relationship after she turned 18.

Rolf Harris's daughter Bindi Nicholls (left), told the court of her shock when she heard of her father's affair with the woman in later life, but said the alleged victim did not mention any underage abuse

Miss 
Nicholls told how she had known the alleged victim ‘from the moment I 
was born’. ‘She was my absolute bestest friend in the world,’ she said. 
‘I loved her to bits, we were inseparable.’

They remained friends as
 adults and met at the Harris family home in Bray, Berkshire, soon after
 Miss Nicholls had her son, Marlon, in 1996.

During the get-together,
 Miss Nicholls confided in her friend that she suspected Harris of an 
affair with his ‘spiritual healer’ and housekeeper, Andi Kingston.

But
 she said she was ‘shocked’ by the response from her friend, who said: 
‘The bitch, the old cow, she is so ugly, what on earth does he see in 
her? How dare he? What a s*** he is. Your dad is a right b******.’

Miss
 Nicholls said: ‘I felt like she was in love with my dad, which is just 
weird. It was like a light went off in my head and I said, “Have you 
been seeing my dad?” and “Has something happened between you and my 
dad?”, and she said, “Yes”.’

She added: ‘She said, “It has been going on since I was 18 or 19, Bindi, it has been going on for ages”.’ 

In
 tears, Miss Nicholls said her friend even described how Harris 
discussed with her how he could improve his relationship with his 
daughter. ‘She said, “He took me out for dinner and all he wanted to 
talk about was you and your relationship. I wanted him to talk about 
me”.’

Miss Nicholls told the court she was so angry with her father 
that before she left the family home she took photos of herself off the 
wall and put them face down.

The television presenter denies all counts.

Jurors heard she was ‘absolutely 
devastated’ by the news and became depressed after returning to her home
 in Devon.

She told the court: ‘How would you feel if your dad and 
your best friend were having an affair? I was suicidal. It was only 
Marlon that kept me going.’

Miss Nicholls denied that her friend had
 told her that Harris had abused her since she was 13. The friends last 
met in 2004 but had an argument in which her friend hit her, Miss 
Nicholls told the court.However, she said she had since worked things out with her father.

‘I
 realised we are all human,’ she added. ‘I had him on a pedestal and now
 I can see him as a father and a man.’

In cross-examination Sasha Wass 
QC, said she had ‘colluded’ with Harris so that their evidence matched.

She
 replied: ‘This is not about me helping my father, this is about telling
 the truth.’

She added: ‘I have been having counselling because it’s 
really difficult being the daughter of a famous man and dealing with 
that on your own is really difficult.’

Speaking of her childhood, Miss Nicholls said: ‘Dad didn’t really take much notice of me, or anyone for that matter, at home.

‘I
 think when he is out in the world he wants to give everyone his time 
and everyone is new and he can tell new jokes and new everything.

‘But when he is at home he is very much switched off, very quiet, quite often working, making something.’

Describing
 the effect of the trial on her parents she said: ‘My parents are 
80-something, this is appalling for them. I have put my life on hold for
 two years. I’m frightened they are going to die in the middle of this 
court case.

‘Have you thought about how your parents might feel in 
this sort of case?’ But Miss Wass shot back: ‘Have you given [the 
alleged victim] any thought?’

Harris denies 12 counts of indecent 
assault against four women aged between seven or eight and 19, over a 
period of almost 20 years, between 1968 and 1986. The trial continues.

Bindi Nicholls compared her famous father’s £11million fortune to ‘winning the lottery’, the court heard yesterday.

She sent Harris an email in July 2012 asking what he wanted to do with his estate and ‘dreaming about the things you could do’, jurors were told.

Miss Nicholls, who denied being ‘financially dependent’ on Harris but admitted he gives her a ‘monthly income’, said the letter was taken out of context.

She said: ‘My dad is very vague about money and I would like to feel a bit more understanding about what he wants and what mum wants and what I can do for them in their old age.’
