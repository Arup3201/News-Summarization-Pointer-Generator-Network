Cara Delevingne, who is known and loved in the fashion industry for her fun-loving and quirky personality, caused a stir when she made a selfie video on the Giles Deacon runway last week.

And in an attempt to top her hilarious antics, the goofy supermodel was seen skipping down Stella McCartney's catwalk at the designer's prestigious AW14 show in Paris today.

The 21-year-old party girl did keep her composure during the main event when she served as Stella's clothes horse but let loose in the finale she and Joan Smalls giggled, shimmied and danced their way down the catwalk in front of the likes of Rihanna and Clemence Poesy.

Composed to crazy! Cara, known and loved for her wacky personality, showcased Stella's knits before breaking into skips, runs and jumps during the finale (right)

Cara and co showcased Stella's new range in all its knitted glory. From oversized tweedy knit jumpers to matching knitted body bags worn across the chest, it seems that Stella shares the fashion industry's vision for full-on knits (take note come Autumn).

But far from drowning her girls in her wooly creations, Stella employed her expert tailoring to offer a streetwear-meets-rap inspired collection in the most flattering form.

She can't be stopped! Cara was seemingly in great spirits in Paris today as she took the fun factor backstage as well

Winter warmers: From oversized tweedy knit jumpers to matching knitted body bags worn across the chest, it seems that Stella shares Mark Fast and Sibling's passion for full-on knits this season, which she gave a sports luxe edge with zips, swirled rope embellishment and chunky neon soled shoes

Close: Stella McCartney and Cara Delevingne share a hug backstage at the show. Cara, who is currently prioritising her acting career, only walked in a few shows this season and Stella was one of her top picks, as well as Burberry and Giles

Best buddies: While Rihanna and Cara haven't been spotted hanging out a lot lately, the duo were reunited at the show in the French capital today

Continuing the sports luxe love-in, the 42-year-old designer served up little evening dresses with a sporty edge and sporty sweats with zip embellishment.

Attention to detail didn't go amiss by Paul McCartney's daughter with hairy textures and silky tassels decorating her garments, plus splashes of tie-dye emblazoned on silky trousers and T-shirts (bound to be a wardrobe staple of Cara's next season).

It was a case of 'the bigger the better' when it came to parkas and anoraks, which came complete with mountaineering toggles and digital prints.

McCartney, who took a bow with her children at the end of the show, was possibly revisiting the raving youth of the Noughties - also seen at Topshop Unique - and who better to show it off than the ultimate wild child, Cara D?
