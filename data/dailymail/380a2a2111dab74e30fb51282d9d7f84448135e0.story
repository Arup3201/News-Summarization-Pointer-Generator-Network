When Cheryl Cole wore a purple and orange outfit at her U.S. X Factor debut, the colour combination was about as popular as her judging.

But 'porange' outfits have grown on us.

Nicole Scherzinger, Kim Kardashian, Jessica Alba and Rihanna have all since sported the trend. And next year it will gain 70,000 new followers as all London Olympics volunteers will be kitted out in a 'regal purple' and 'poppy red' jacket.

Sparking a trend: Cheryl Cole's orange and purple outfit, which she wore in May, may have inspired the London Olympics volunteer's uniforms

The uniforms, which will be worn by 'Games Makers' at the London 2012 Games, were unveiled yesterday

They were created by a London 2012 and adidas design team and are apparently a throwback to the historic Grenadier Guards uniform - note the epaulettes and the buttons on the sleeves.

Classic British sporting events such as the London 1948 Games, Wimbledon tennis championships and the Henley Regatta provided additional inspiration.

But the design team also seem to have taken into account the latest fashion trends.

London 2012 chief executive Paul 
Deighton said of the volunteers: 'They will be high profile in London and in our venues 
across the UK at Games time and so it's important they look the part.'

The jacket has a turn-back feature to suit different arm lengths and different-coloured epaulettes will 
identify specific groups, with white for medical staff, red for team 
leaders and green for anti-doping personnel.

Games Makers: Volunteers reveal the various uniforms which will be worn at the Olympics

The uniform will be worn by volunteers at both the Olympics and the Paralympics. Only the logo on the jacket, the hat and T-shirt will change depending on which games the person is working at.

All will be given the beige trousers and the grey trainers with red laces.

The 4,500 technical officials at the 
Games will have a formal or casual uniform, depending on the sport they 
are helping to regulate.

The
formalwear design team, made up of 
representatives from London 2012 and the high street fashion chain Next,
also had ideas about British heritage up their sleeves for the 
uniforms.

Full uniform: Games Makers will get an overall kitbag including a jacket, polo shirt, trousers, trainers, socks, cap, bag, water bottle and an umbrella

They will wear engraved buttons with Big Ben and the Houses of Parliament plus embroidered collars featuring the London skyline.

Games Makers will get an overall kitbag 
including a jacket, polo shirt, trousers, trainers, socks, cap, bag, 
water bottle and an umbrella - a vital accessory for the British summer.

Each Technical Official uniform will 
come with jacket, pair of trousers and skirt for women, a shirt, a belt 
and a laptop-sized bag.

A trilby hat and a tie tops off the men's kit while there is a scarf for women technical officials.

An effort has been made to make the uniforms sustainable to fit in with the Games' ethos.

The polo shirt is made of 100 per cent recycled polyester, as is the jacket shell, while the outer and inner lining consists of partly recycled polyester, along with the trousers. Sustainable materials have also been used in the bag and water bottle.

Deighton said: 'What we've come up with is a uniform which celebrates the best of Britain's heritage in a modern and sustainable way.

'Delivering the Games is hard work and so the uniform needs to be functional. However we also want our teams to wear it with pride. We showed it to them this morning and the response was incredibly enthusiastic.'

Games Makers will start picking up their uniforms from April 2012.
