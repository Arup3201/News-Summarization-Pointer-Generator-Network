Ukrainian government forces came under artillery fire late on Saturday near the strategic port of Mariupol in eastern Ukraine - just 30 hours after leaders declared a ceasefire.

The presidents of Russia and Ukraine had said earlier that the truce - part of a plan intended to end more than four months of conflict - was largely holding across eastern Ukraine, where Kiev's forces have been battling pro-Russian separatists.

Witnesses reported that heavy explosions were coming from Mariupol's eastern outskirts, where Ukrainian troops have held defensive lines against the rebels.The port has been a key flashpoint in the past week of fighting.

There were also reports of a truck, a gas station and an industrial facility ablaze in the city, while pictures taken on Saturday night showed a Ukrainian army checkpoint up in flames.

One Ukrainian fighter said on Facebook that Grad rockets were fired at their positions surrounding Mariupol, a city of about 500,000 on the coast of the Sea of Azov.

Trucks were seen moving eastwards with agitated-looking pro-government militia volunteers, according to reports. Tanks and armoured personnel carriers were also seen headed in the same direction.

One Ukrainian officer told Reuters: 'There has been an artillery attack. We received a number of impacts. We have no information about casualties.'

The area had been quiet since the ceasefire took effect on Friday evening, but many in Mariupol and in Donetsk - the other main flashpoint in the conflict - expressed doubts that the ceasefire could last.

Meanwhile, 
the International Committee for the Red Cross said on its Twitter 
account that its workers had tried to deliver food aid to the city of 
Luhansk, which had endured weeks of heavy fighting, but turned back 
after shelling northeast of the city. It did not give further details.

In the days leading up to the ceasefire, pro-Russian opened a new front on the coast of Mariupol, leading to fears that the separatists were trying to secure a land corridor between Russia and the Crimean Peninsula, which Russia annexed in March.

Earlier on Saturday, both sides said the cease-fire was mostly holding, but the truce still appeared fragile as both sides of the conflict claimed violations.

Ukraine's President Petro Poroshenko said he and Russia's Vladimir Putin
 had agreed in a telephone call that 'overall the ceasefire was being 
implemented' and that they needed to find ways to make it more durable. The Kremlin later released a similar statement.

Col. Andriy Lysenko, a spokesman for Ukraine's national security council, told reporters that rebels had fired at Ukrainian forces on 10 occasions Friday night after the ceasefire took effect.

In Donetsk, the largest city controlled by the Russian-backed separatists, the night passed quietly - a rarity after several months of daily shelling in residential areas.

Ukraine,
 Russia and the Kremlin-backed separatists signed the cease-fire deal 
Friday in Minsk, the Belarusian capital, in an effort to end more than 
four months of fighting in the region.

The
 negotiators also agreed on the withdrawal of all heavy weaponry, the 
release of all prisoners and the delivery of humanitarian aid to 
devastated cities in eastern Ukraine.

Andriy Lysenko, the spokesman of 
Ukraine's National Security and Defence Council, said Kiev wanted the 
exchange of prisoners of war to take place 'as fast as possible' but 
gave no timeframe.

He said the rebels were holding more than 200 Ukrainians captive.

Mr Poroshenko agreed to the ceasefire 
after Ukraine accused Russia of sending troops and arms onto its 
territory in support of the separatists, who had suffered big losses 
over the summer. Moscow denies sending troops or arming the rebels.

If
 the ceasefire holds, it would be a landmark achievement for both sides.
 Fighting between pro-Russian rebels and Ukrainian government troops has
 ravaged the already teetering Ukrainian economy, claimed at least 2,600
 civilian lives and left hundreds of thousands homeless, according to 
United Nations estimates.

A
 previous 10-day cease-fire, which each side repeatedly accused the 
other of violating, yielded few results at the negotiating table.

U.S. President Barack Obama said he was hopeful the cease-fire would hold but unsure the rebels would follow through.

'It has to be tested,' President Obama said Friday at the close of a two-day NATO summit in Wales.

Mr Poroshenko spent Thursday and Friday 
at the NATO summit in Wales where David Cameron, U.S. President Barack 
Obama and other leaders urged Putin to pull its forces out of Ukraine.

NATO also approved wide-ranging plans to boost its defences in eastern Europe in response to the Ukraine crisis.

The Ukraine conflict has revived talk of a new Cold War as the West accuses Putin of deliberately destabilising the former Soviet republic. Putin says he is defending the interests of ethnic Russians facing discrimination and oppression.

The European Union announced new economic sanctions against Russia late on Friday over its role in Ukraine but said they could be suspended if Moscow withdraws its troops and observes the conditions of the ceasefire.

Russia's foreign ministry responded angrily on Saturday to the measures, pledging unspecified 'reaction' if they were implemented. Moscow responded to a previous round of U.S. and EU sanctions by banning most Western food imports.
