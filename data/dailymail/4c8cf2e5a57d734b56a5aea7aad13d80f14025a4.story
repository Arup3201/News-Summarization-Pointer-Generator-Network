Salman Rushdie’s attempts to wed for the fifth time were wrecked after a marriage proposal to his latest girlfriend was reportedly rejected.

Michelle Barish turned down his request and gave back the seven-carat emerald-cut diamond ring he had given her, reported the New York Post.

The controversial 64-year-old author proposed to the stunning ex-wife of Chris Barish, the co-owner of nightclub chain Marquee, last December.

Unlikely lothario: Salman Rushdie dances with Michelle Barish at a previous birthday party. She turned down his marriage request and returned a pricey ring

That came just two days after she 
split from billionaire boyfriend Steve Tisch, New York Giants NFL 
co-owner and producer of Forrest Gump.

Ms Barish has a daughter named Bee 
with Mr Barish and declined Mr Rushdie’s offer so she can focus on her child, 
reported the New York Post.

She had been dating Mr Tisch since 
last August after a friend set them up, but they reportedly ended their 
relationship last December.

Their time together came to an end at a lavish party in the Gramercy Park Hotel in Manhattan, New York, at which Mr Rushdie was also present.

The evening was co-hosted by designer 
Stacey Bendet, a mutual friend of Ms Barish and Mr Rushdie, and she 
invited the author to the party.

The author chose to have a drink with 
Ms Barish in a separate part of the hotel away from the main party, a 
source close to him told MailOnline.

This came after Mr Rushdie ended his 
relationship with young socialite Devorah Rose. Neither Mr Rushdie nor 
Ms Barish have commented.

Ms Rose, the busty and beautiful 
reality TV wannabe, said in December that Rushdie is a 'literary genius 
with the emotions of a horny child'.

Couple? Devorah Rose tweeted this photo of herself with Salman Rushdie at dinner, prompting him to say the pair were never romantically involved

She said she admired the acclaimed 
author, but when she wouldn't sleep with him, he dumped her and sullied 
her name in the press, she claims.

He is said to have dumped her by text 
after she tweeted a photo of them together, though he claimed the pair 
were never romantically involved.

Three years ago he insisted he 
wouldn't rule out relationships completely but had no desire for a fifth
union, saying: 'There is no need to marry'.

Mr Rushdie married his first wife 
Clarissa Luard in 1976 and had a son, Zafar. They split up in 1987 and 
he married Marianne Wiggins a year later.

They divorced in 1993, before he 
married his third wife Elizabeth West and then his fourth wife Padma 
Lakshmi, whom he split from in 2007.
