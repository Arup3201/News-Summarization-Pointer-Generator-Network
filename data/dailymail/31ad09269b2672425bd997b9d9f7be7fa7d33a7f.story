A decision to destroy two RAF dogs that guarded Prince William just days after he quit the service has angered animal experts and upset staff on his former base.

Brus, a Belgian Shepherd, and Blade, a German Shepherd, were put down on Friday, shortly after the prince completed his final shift as a search and rescue pilot at RAF Valley on Anglesey.

Charities said the animals had been disposed of like a piece of worn-out military kit while one animal behaviour expert suggested the decision was ‘a euthanasia of convenience’.

The dead dogs were among 288 that the  Ministry of Defence has put down in the last ten years.

Base workers pointed out they had been 
very  popular and said animal-lover William – who has a dog of his own –
may also have been shocked by their fate.

They were part of a unit brought in to
provide additional security while the second in line to the throne was 
based at RAF Valley.

A 
Ministry of Defence spokesman last night insisted that the decision to 
destroy the dogs was ‘entirely coincidental’ and that the animals could 
not be rehomed or redeployed because of medical and behavioural issues.

But
the decision was the talk of the air base yesterday. One member of 
staff said William – who has a spaniel, Lupo – could often be seen 
giving the dogs a pat.

‘Everyone is talking about the dogs and people are upset they’ve been put down,’ the staff member said.

‘I
saw William stroke the German Shepherd a few times and made a fuss of 
him. They were really popular and William always said hello to all the 
handlers.’

Local resident 
Huw Williams, 59, added: ‘I know a few of the lads on the base and I 
know the dogs were well liked there. One told me  William would often go
and pat the dogs when he saw them. I bet he will be sad that they 
couldn’t have found a safe home.’

Kensington Palace declined to comment yesterday, saying the issue was a matter for the MoD.

William
had been based at RAF Valley since 2010. He completed his last flight 
as a Sea King pilot nine days ago and has now officially left the 
military. Blade and Brus were in a two-dog section set up to patrol the 
airbase during the future king’s deployment. They patrolled the station 
to protect military personnel, equipment and facilities. But once the 
prince left the unit was closed,’ a source said.

The
two animals were assessed by a squadron inspector to see if they could 
be returned to the Defence Animal Centre, which helps train new 
handlers. But they were both deemed unsuitable. Blade, nine and a half, 
suffered from osteoarthritis in the hips and had been diagnosed with the
onset of a spinal condition, which is common in German Shepherds of 
that age. It was decided he should be destroyed for medical reasons.

Brus,
seven and a half, was said to display high levels of stress which 
resulted in him ‘self-harming and displaying excessive aggression’. He 
was deemed ‘a risk to himself, his handler and others’.

But
animal behaviour expert Dr Roger Mugford commented: ‘Behavioural 
problems are often used as a bland excuse for putting dogs to sleep. 
What you have to do is work hard at making their environment better for 
them. It begs the question, would these dogs still be alive if Prince 
William was at the base? It sounds sound like a euthanasia of 
convenience.’

A spokesman 
for the Dogs Trust charity said: ‘Dogs are not pieces of disposable kit 
that can be decommissioned at the end of their useful military life. We 
fully understand that most service dogs cannot be rehomed as pets. 
Deployment to another role or retirement to a specialist handler are two
alternative options.’  A spokesman from People for the Ethical 
Treatment of Animals said: ‘Dogs are not tools and are not ours to use 
and toss away like empty ammunition shells.’

Asked
by the Mail whether both dogs were deemed healthy and fit to work up 
until the time they were destroyed despite the issues they were said to 
have suffered from, an MoD spokesman said: ‘I don’t think we are in a 
position to confirm this.’

An
RAF spokesman said: ‘Whilst security was increased during Prince 
William’s tour of RAF Valley, which included the introduction of canine 
security patrols, these dogs and with their handlers, were not solely 
assigned to HRH The Duke of Cambridge as personal protection.

‘The
timing of their sad demise was purely coincidental. The MoD’s policy is
to re-home all military working dogs at the end of their service life 
wherever practicable.  These dogs had a record of veterinary and 
behavioural issues which meant that they could not be reassigned to 
other duties and they were too aggressive to be kept at home.’
