Premiership giants Manchester City have the Etihad Stadium, Arsenal have the Emirates Stadium, and now a small club from Wales have jumped on the sponsorship bandwagon after renaming their home - The Cigg-e Stadium.

Fans of Merthyr Town FC are fuming after the club announced details of a £60,000 three-year sponsorship deal with electronic cigarette firm Cigg-e.

Already suffering from a slight persecution complex - they are nicknamed the Martyrs - diehard supporters fear their new name will cause rival fans to roll-up with laughter.

Fresh lungs: Cigg-e has breathed new life into Merthyr Town FC with a new sponsorship deal

Fuming: Fans are less than impressed with the news their beloved ground is to be renamed The Cigg-e Stadium

Despite the club describing the development as 'fantastic news' on its website, the fans have not exactly reached for the celebratory cigars.

Dave Williams, 57, said: 'We should have stubbed this out before signing the sponsorship deal.

'We will be the laughing stock. Arsenal calling their stadium the Emirates and man City the Etihad is one thing, but the Cigg-e Stadium sounds just daft.'

Liz Thomas, another fan, 50, added: 'We will be the butt of everyone's jokes. I can't image fans saying "are you goiing down the Cigg-e ground?" or "see you at the Cigg-e".

'We'll have all the cigarette jokes about signing Players, getting a Regal reception and scoring from a Lucky Strike.'

Merthyr is one of the poorest towns in the country where the average age of someone taking up smoking is just nine.

New name: Part of the deal involves the ground being renamed The Cigge-e Stadium

Thirty per cent of the town suffers from a long-term illness, many of which are smoking related.

Cigg-e, which distributes electronic cigarettes from its Cardiff base, is about to open a shop in the town.

Operations manager Scott Davies said: 'Cigg-e are delighted to have 
entered into a partnership with Merthyr Town FC, and that they are 
looking forward to a long and prosperous relationship both on and off 
the field.'

The club's commercial manager Brent Carter added: 'This a first of its kind deal for Merthyr Town FC, and this will 
considerably aid the long term stability of the club.'

The team, which has a proud 105-year history and currently plays in the Division One South and West League, will continue to light-up the pitch at the less controversially named Penydarren Park until September.

Medicine: E-cigarette's such as this one here are to be reclassified

Last month the Government announced electronic cigarettes were to be classified as medicines in a bid to tighten up regulation.

Although they contain nicotine, electronic cigarettes are marketed as being less harmful than real ones because they do not contain harmful toxins such as tar.

But research has shown the levels of nicotine each e-cigarette contains varies from batch to batch. By regulating the products, they will have to come up to a required standard.

It is estimated about 1.3million people use e-cigarettes in the UK, which are inhaled like normal cigarettes, although the vapour is mainly made up of water.

Fearing the unknown consequences, some countries, such as Brazil and Mexico, have banned them altogether, even though actual tobacco remains legal.

The USA, already vehemently opposed to smoking with many states banning it in public places, is also sceptical about the supposed benefits of electronic cigarettes.

Boston is the latest city to be considering introducing an outright ban on people using them. In 2011 bans preventing under 18s and people using them in the workplace were brought in.
