Dexter Richardson, 47, a former police officer in Riviera Beach, Florida, was charged Tuesday with having uninformed HIV infected sexual intercourse with his girlfriend

A former police officer from Florida has been arrested for allegedly failing to disclose to his long-term girlfriend that he was HIV positive.

Dexter Richardson, 47, of Riviera Beach, was charged Tuesday with having uninformed HIV infected sexual intercourse.

Police first became aware of the allegations back in May when Richardson’s girlfriend contacted the department accusing the former cop of infecting her with the virus.

The woman said when she confronted the 47-year-old man, he initially denied being HIV positive but then admitted that he has been living with the illness for about a decade.

It has been determined by detectives that Richardson has been aware for several years that he had tested positive for HIV, Palm Beach Post reported.

The former Riviera Beach cop, however, kept that information about his health status from his girlfriend, according to investigators.

Richardson had a troubled past in law enforcement; he was fired from the Riviera Beach Police Department in 1998 after allegedly sharing information with another officer who was under investigation at the time.

In the late 1980s, Richardson served on the force in Pompano Beach but was terminated for being involved in up to eight 'unjustified accidents' in his patrol car.

After being hired by the Riviera Beach police, the cop got into six more crashes between 1993 and 1996.

That year, Richardson was also arrested for getting into a confrontation with a gas station clerk in Delray Beach who refused to let him use the bathroom. 

Dexter Richardson was taken into custody in the HIV case on Sunday. He has since been released on bond.

Police suspect that he may have had other sexual partners who were unaware that he was HIV positive. 

Richardson’s arrest marks the second time this year that an officer from Palm Beach County has been accused of knowingly spreading HIV. 

In January, Greenacres cop Ervans Saintclair has been charged with two counts of criminal transmission of the potentially deadly virus.

Saintclair entered a not guilty plea in March and is due back in court later this month.
