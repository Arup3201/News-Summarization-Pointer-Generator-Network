The east coast of Australia can finally say goodbye to the winter weather and welcome the start of spring this week with temperatures set to rise along the New South Wales coast. 

Over the past 16 days, foul weather has struck the east coast of Australia, with flooding, heavy rain and strong coastal winds across NSW and parts of Queensland.

Despite 10 or 11 dry days at the start of the month, August has seen the most days of rain since the 'February to forget'.

Overall good news for the east coast of Australia, which should expect to experience less wet days during the first month of Spring and warmer dry days

According to the Bureau of Meteorology, NSW coast has seen the wettest August in over a decade and one of the wettest on record, reporting 209mm of rain compared with an average of 80mm.

Thankfully, by Sunday morning showers are expected to clear, with most places dry by sunrise and sun expected to shine across all of NSW, with only partly cloudy areas in the Hunter and northern parts of Sydney.

Warm weather is expected to continue on Monday, reaching a scorching top of 24 degrees but by the evening temperatures will drop sweeping through with showers on Tuesday and Wednesday.

Illawarra, NSW – 277mm (wettest August since 1998)

Sydney, NSW – 191.8mm (wettest August since 1998)

Coffs Harbour, NSW – 198mm (wettest August since 2007)

Brisbane, QLD - 89.6mm (wettest august since 2010)

Melbourne, VIC - 38mm

But rainy winter weather isn't the only thing expected to settle down, as a huge swell swept across NSW's coast on Friday, Sydney Morning Herald reported.

According to the Australian Bureau of Meteorology the low over the Tasman Sea is expected to slowly shift towards New Zealand, as windy conditions and moderate to large swells along the NSW coast ease as the low moves away and weakens.

Southerly winds over the past two days have called for all NSW beaches to be considered 'closed', as 4-metre offshore swells and up to 2-metre surf cause for dangerous conditions.

Sarah Chadwick, senior forecaster at the Bureau of Meteorology, said in August swells greater than 2.5 metres occur only about 10 per cent of the time.
