Luke 'Sasha' Fleischman, the 'agender' teenager who was set on fire in an alleged hate crime on an LA bus

An 'agender' teenager set on fire by another boy on a bus in Los Angeles is allegedly thought to have been the victim of a 'hate crime.'

Luke ‘Sasha’ Fleischman, 18 - who does not identify as a man or woman but rather as ‘agender’ - was set on fire on an AC Transit bus in Oakland by another teenager on Monday.

Thousands of dollars have already been raised for a fund, set up in the victims hometown, to pay for his treatment for second and third degree burns, according to local sources.

The Maybeck High School student is expected to need several surgeries, including skin grafts, and months of recovery time.

Police say they used surveillance video to track down the 16-year old accused of the attack to Oakland High School.  He is now in custody and has been charged with the crime.

The suspect, who has not been named, is alleged  to have used a lighter to set fire to Fleischman’s skirt.

‘This is extremely disturbing,’ said Oakland police spokeswoman Johnna Watson.

‘This is a horrific crime: a human being set another human being on fire. I mean, that’s senseless and horrible.'

Investigators are still looking for a motive in the incident, including the possibility it is a hate crime.

‘This could happen anywhere to anyone, unfortunately it happened to our victim,’ said Johnna Watson.

By Wednesday morning backers at raised more than $8,300 towards their $18,000 goal to pay for the teenager's treatment at St. Francis Memorial Hospital in San Francisco, according to Kron4 News.

The incident happened  when the victim was asleep in the rear of an Alameda-Contra Costa Transit bus in Oakland, shortly after 5 p.m on Monday.

Fleischman woke up with his clothing was on fire and tried to put it out himself.

Other passengers came to his aid but he suffered severe burns to his legs.

Once the bus driver realized what happened, he stopped the bus and called for assistance but the suspect fled the scene before police arrived.

The Helping Sasha Have a Speedy Recovery fund is aiming to raise over $20,000 dollars for the teenager.
