A young man who brutally murdered a 73-year-old by stabbing him 22 times after the pensioner discovered him  breaking into his south London home has been sentenced to life.

Aaron De Silva, 21, will serve a minimum of 32 years for the murder of Joseph Griffiths in his £1.5million home in Fulham, south London.

De Silva had admitted the manslaughter of Joseph Griffiths, but denied murder. However he was found guilty of murdering the 73-year-old on Tuesday following a trial at the Old Bailey.

A Metropolitan Police spokesman said 
the 21-year-old, of Earls Court, south west London, was also sentenced 
to 12 years to run consecutively after admitting aggravated burglary 
armed with a lock knife.

De Silva killed Mr Griffiths after he broke into the basement of the grandfather's six-storey house armed with a knife.

The
 victim of the 'brutal' attack was asleep with his wife at the time and 
got out of bed to challenge the intruder in the hallway.

He was then discovered in a pool of blood by his wife and a friend, who was visiting for a wedding.

Prosecutor Brendan Finucane QC told the jury when he opened the trial: 'There were no eye witnesses but people were awoken by a completely brutal and overwhelming assault on an elderly man in his own home, where he was knifed 22 times to the body.'

In the act: CCTV footage shows de Silva in the process of robbing the home before the murder

Weapon: The knife used during the brutal confrontation was found in the terraced house in south west London

After the attack De Silva was caught 
on CCTV taking a 'cool, calm and collected walk' back to the Earls Court
 hostel where he was staying to wash his clothes and get rid of 
evidence, Mr Finucane said. He was arrested three days later.

The
 court heard that De Silva had gone into a number of gardens on the 
street before stealing a pair of bolt croppers from a shed.

Using
 the tool, he broke a rear window on the basement level of Mr Griffiths’
 nearby  terraced home and walked around the lower two levels.

Mr Finucane said: 'Mr Griffiths must have been woken by the defendant coming in, must have challenged him in the hallway, outside his own bedroom door.'

It was at this point, Mr Finucane said, De Silva carried out the 'brutal and overwhelming assault', stabbing him 22 times in his chest and abdomen.

He added: 'This awoke his wife and friends, but by the time they got there he had left.'

Mrs Griffiths found her husband lying on his back in a pool of blood. The front door was still locked, and Mr Hall found the rear basement door had been opened.

Closure: Mark Griffiths said after the hearing that Mr Griffiths' friends and family felt a 'great sense of relief'

Family: Simon, the victim's son, arriving at the Old Bailey

Paramedics tried to resuscitate Mr Griffiths, but he died in the house.

Mr
 Finucane said: 'Given the savagery of the attack on Mr Griffiths and 
his behaviour before and after, there can be no doubt that he had the 
intention to kill or cause really serious harm.'

He
 added: 'Anybody who stabs a person 22 times with a knife like that has 
at the very least the intention to cause really serious harm, and 
further you can be sure that he did it with the intention to kill the 
deceased.'

De Silva looked impassively as the verdict was read out. He is said to have 31 previous 
convictions from the age of 12 to his arrest for the murder when he was 
19, for matters such as robbery, burglary and carrying a knife.

Mr
 Griffiths’ eldest son, Mark Griffiths, 53, said afterwards: 'There is a
 great sense of relief for all the family, friends and customers of 
Joe.'

The victim had a car repair business in which his son still works.

He added: 'We are overwhelmed with all the support we have had from the police, and very impressed with the way they’ve handled it from day one.

'We are very happy that the legal system of this country has proved to be one of the best in the world, as usual, and we have come to the correct verdict.'

Scene: The brutal attack took place in a £1.5m six-storey terraced house in Fulham, south west London

In an impact statement written by Mark
 Griffiths, on behalf of the family, which was read to the court, he 
said: 'The murder of Joe in such a senseless manner has left a gaping 
hole not just in our family, but every family who knew him.'

The statement added: 'We as a family are living with the devastating consequences of that act of violence.'

The trial judge, Timothy Pontius, sentenced De Silva’s father Emmanuel de Silva to 24 years’ imprisonment in 2002 for robbery.

Court reports at the time said he was part of a gang that was responsible for a number of well planned and executed robberies in the London area between January 2000 and May 2001.

The reports said that Emmanuel’s nephew, Orson de Silva, was jailed for 24 years for similar offences.

Investigating officer Detective Inspector Simon Pickford, of the Homicide and Major Crime Command, said: 'De Silva is an extremely violent individual who had no hesitation in stabbing the victim repeatedly in a frenzied and brutal attack after he was disturbed having broken into Mr Griffiths’ home.

'I must pay tribute to Mr Griffiths’ family who have been left utterly devastated by what happened. They have conducted themselves with the utmost restraint and dignity throughout this tragic incident and my and my team’s thoughts are with them.'

CCTV showed De Silva back at his hostel around an hour after the murder listening to music, seemingly entirely unaffected by what he had just done.

Mr Griffiths had two grown-up sons and seven grandchildren.
