Psychiatric patient Richard Plotts (pictured) opened fire at the hospital

A psychiatric patient had dozens of bullets on hand when he killed his caseworker and intended to kill more people at a suburban Philadelphia hospital complex on Thursday afternoon, authorities say

Richard Plotts, 49, had a problem with the hospital's ban on guns, although it's not clear if that was the direct motive for the shooting, Delaware County District Attorney Jack Whelan said.

Psychiatrist Lee Silverman told police he fired back at Plotts with his own weapon after Plotts opened fire at an office adjacent to Mercy Fitzgerald Hospital in Darby.

Whelan says Silverman routinely carried a gun and had no specific fear of the suspect.

Authorities
 say Plotts is sedated but in stable condition after surgery from his 
gunshot wounds. They expect to charge him with murder at his bedside 
once he awakes.

Police say 
Plotts has a lengthy history of gun arrests, violence and mental health 
problems. They say he had 39 bullets on him after the shooting.

The
 psychiatrist, Dr. Lee Silverman, was grazed in the temple during the 
gunfight in his office Thursday afternoon with patient Plotts.

'There were some issues between the doctor and the patient, but whether or not he actually feared him is unclear,' Whelan said.

The slain caseworker, 53-year-old 
Theresa Hunt of Philadelphia, had accompanied Plotts to the psychiatric 
crisis center at Mercy Fitzgerald Hospital in Darby, just southwest of 
the city, authorities said.

'When the caseworker was shot, (Silverman) crouched down behind the desk to avoid him being shot,' Whelan said.

'He
 was able to reach for his weapon, and realizing it was a life or death 
situation, was able to engage the defendant in the exchange of gunfire.'

The
 struggle spilled out into the hallway, where another doctor and 
caseworker jumped in to help Silverman and secure Plotts' weapon, Whelan
 said.

Police in Upper Darby
 were aware of at least three mental health commitments involving Plotts
 — once after he cut his wrists and once when he threatened suicide — 
but said such stays can last just one to three days.

Plotts also had at least four gun arrests, along with assault and drug charges, according to police and court records.

And he has been barred from at least 
one residential shelter because of his violent history, Upper Darby 
police Superintendent Michael Chitwood said Friday.

'The
 case workers and the doctors and the catchment centers — they know who 
violent individuals are, because they're frequent fliers. And the system
 is not geared toward keeping these people housed somewhere until they 
start to be better. So you put whole communities at risk,' Chitwood 
said.

Plotts may have been 
angry with Silverman over his treatment plan, Whelan said. Colleagues 
heard arguing during the appointment and saw Plotts aiming a gun at 
Silverman when they peaked inside the door. They quietly backed out and 
called 911. The shooting soon began, just before 2:30 p.m.

However, Whelan did not know if Silverman was carrying a gun because of a specific fear of Plotts.

The
 psychiatrist was recuperating at home Friday. His wife said he did not 
want to discuss the shooting, and she also declined to comment.

Plotts does not have a listed home number, and it was unclear if he has relatives in the area.

Hospital
 policy bars anyone except on-duty law enforcement officers from 
carrying weapons on campus, a Mercy Health System spokeswoman said. She 
otherwise declined to discuss the reports that Silverman was armed at 
work.

'We remain focused on 
working with the Delaware County Police Departments to understand fully 
the details of the event,' said the spokeswoman, Bernice Ho.

Yeadon Police Chief Donald Molineux said that 'without a doubt, I believe the doctor saved lives.'

'Without
 that firearm, this guy (the patient) could have went out in the hallway
 and just walked down the offices until he ran out of ammunition,' the 
chief said.

Both guns were 
recovered from the scene. The exchange of gunfire occurred on the third 
floor of the Wellness Center at Mercy Fitzgerald, a 204-bed community 
teaching hospital.

There
 are no surveillance cameras in the doctor's office or the waiting area 
outside, and no metal detectors at the entrance, authorities said.

Cathy
 Nickel, a neighbor at Plotts' last known address, an apartment complex 
in Upper Darby, saw a caseworker move him out of the building about a 
year ago. As he was taken away in a van, she said, he yelled, 'You 
haven't heard the end of me!'
