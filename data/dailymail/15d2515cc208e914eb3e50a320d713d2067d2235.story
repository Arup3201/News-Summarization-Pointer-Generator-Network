Sitting on the steps of the now infamous Ivy Apartments in Dallas this is the woman who Ebola victim Thomas Eric Duncan flew to the States to marry.

Seen here for the first time, Louise Troh, 54, is pictured next to her nephew Jeffrey Cole, who arrived in Dallas from Liberia just days before Mr Duncan.

Now both Ms Troh and Mr Cole are in quarantine along with her 13-year-old son and a friend.

While 42-year-old Mr Duncan's life continues to hang in the balance, District Attorney Craig Watkins has revealed that his office is actively investigating whether or not Mr Duncan will face criminal prosecution should he recover.

A spokesperson for the Dallas DA has told MailOnline that he could face the charge of Aggravated Assault with a Deadly Weapon – with the Ebola virus as that weapon. If convicted this carries a jail term of two to 20 years. 

Prayer: Louise Troh, 54, the 'wife' of Thomas Eric Duncan sitting on the steps of her apartment before with nephew Jeffrey Cole, who is also now in quarantine with her

Hope: Ms Troh told her pastor that she broke down in prayer on hearing Duncan is getting a new drug

Debbie Denmon said, 'We are investigating whether Mr Duncan exposed the public to a deadly virus knowingly which would be criminal intent. We are looking at what he said on record at the hospital and to the people he was with and around.'

Ms Denmon revealed that the DA had received several complaints from members of the public angry at the revelation that Mr Duncan allegedly lied on exit documents which asked if he had been exposed to the dreaded virus.

Meanwhile, it also emerged that a gofundme site set up to raise money for Duncan and his medical treatment had only seen $50 donated (of a target $100,000) in the six days it has been active - despite the huge publicity his case has raised and the terrible fight for survival he finds himself in.

The day before he was due to travel he carried a pregnant woman home when she was desperately sick with Ebola and had been denied treatment at a Liberian hospital. She later died of the illness.

Ms Denmon said that this was something the DA was taking 'very seriously'.

She said: 'It's the District Attorney’s role to keep the public safe and you just can't have people circumventing procedures and thinking that they can just hop on a plane, lie on documents, from Liberia and just enter the country here in Dallas county thinking that there are no consequences'. 

Prosecution: Officials told MailOnline that Duncan faces a charge of aggravated assault with a  deadly weapon if he recovers because he lied on forms to come into the country. Pictured here arriving on US soil

The DA has previously successfully prosecuted an HIV positive man who had unprotected sex, while knowingly infected, with the charge currently being considered in Mr Duncan's case.

But Ms Denmon added ‘On a humane level we're saddened that somebody is fighting for their life. Here’s someone who tried to help a pregnant woman and your heart does go out to him.

'It would be inhumane to prosecute someone on their deathbed so we're treading very lightly on this one. We're weighing all of that. It's a very delicate matter'.

Mr Duncan’s condition remains critical though his family have drawn hope from the fact that he started receiving experimental drug treatment on Saturday afternoon.

George Mason, Senior Pastor at Wilshire Baptist Church, where Ms Troh is a member, is in daily contact with the stricken woman as she and her family wait out their 21 days of isolation,.

He said: 'I can tell you that Louise just began to thank God and broke out in praise when she heard that they were giving Eric the experimental drug.

'She was so deeply relieved that they could begin that. It has cheered her tremendously.' 

Earlier Pastor Mason told MailOnline of the family's relief at having been moved from the Ivy Apartments – which Ms Troh describes as an 'apartment of sickness' – to a secret location within city limits.

Ms Troh, who has a 19-year-old son by Mr Duncan, left Liberia more than a decade ago after a falling out saw the couple split.

It has been reported that they renewed their relationship following a visit by Ms Troh to Monrovia earlier this year.

But, although they spoke of marriage Pastor Mason said that they had only actually reconnected recently over the telephone.

Support: Duncan's nephew, Josephus Weeks, is comforted by Jesse Jackson who arrived in Dallas today after an invitation from the family to help them

Plea: A gofundme page set up for Duncan has only raised $50 in six days. Many commentors on the page are angry over Duncan's false claim that he hadn't been exposed to the virus before traveling to the US

Care: Duncan's mother, Nowah Gartay, was driven 15 hours from Charlotte, NC, to be by Duncan's bedside

He said: 'Louise hasn't been out of the country in a long time. When they reconnected it was over the telephone. Their relationship had never led to marriage in Liberia but that is what they were talking of when Mr Duncan came here.' 

Pastor Mason and his congregation have shown nothing but compassion for Ms Troh and her family during their ordeal with the faith community funding their stay in this new location and providing meals and support.

But a GoFundMe page set up by Mr Duncan's nephew, Josephus Weeks, has shown a different face to this crisis with just $50 donated since October 1.

It reads: 'Mr. Eric Thomas Duncan is the first diagnosed case of EBOLA within the United States. He came to visit with his son and watch him graduate high school. Eric needs your help to assist with the costs incurred by medical treatment. He is fighting for his life in an isolation unit in Texas. Please support his cause in donating to this noble charity. Thanks for your consideration!'

Instead of raising funds it has seen criticism heaped upon Mr Duncan by members of the public angry at the alleged lie that allowed him and his deadly virus, into the country.

Commentors have largely been unkind and lambasted the 'audacity' of the page. One states that Mr Duncan should be 'charged with attempted murder if he survives'.

For now his survival depends entirely on the treatment he is receiving at Texas Presbyterian Hospital.

And just who is footing the medical bill that has already run to tens of thousands of dollars remains unclear. MailOnline has put the question to Texas Presbyterian Hospital and is awaiting a response.

Meanwhile, Mr Duncan's mother has traveled to be close to her son as he fights for his life against the deadly virus. 

Nowah Gartay, was driven 15 hours by family members from her home in Charlotte, North Carolina to Dallas on Monday where she hopes to find a way to talk to her son.

In a video message filmed for her son with NBC last week, Mrs Gartay said: 'I love you. I pray for you to get well. My whole thinking is on you.'

Today Rev Jesse Jackson Sr embraced Weeks and Gartay after he landed in Dallas to help the family.

Rev Jackson landed in Dallas this morning having come, he tweeted, ‘Upon request of family #ThomasEricDuncan…to bring comfort& to seek best humanitarian relief America has to offer.’

He spent the morning with community leaders at the South Dallas Café and will lead a prayer vigil outside the hospital at 5pm this afternoon. 

A spokesman for the hospital said on Tuesday afternoon: 'Mr. Duncan remains in critical condition. His condition is stable. He is on a ventilator and receiving kidney dialysis. His liver function, which declined over the weekend, has improved, but doctors caution that this could vary in coming days. He will continue to receive the investigational medication brincidofovir.'

Speaking to MailOnline Dallas City Councilor Jennifer Staubach Gates who represents District 13 in which Vickery Meadows is located complained about the negative stigma that the case has brought the area. 

She said: 'I've had 15 men come to me today, turned away from their jobs. I've referred them to lawyers through legal aid. They work at various Dallas based companies and have been told not to come back for 21 days unless they can provide a note from the Health Department.'

Ground zero: The final clean up of Troh's apartment has been carried out. Duncan was staying there

Safety: Troh and three others who were in the apartment are now at an undisclosed location donated by others

Ms Gates stressed that none of these men were being tracked or traced by the CDC and that none were considered in any way 'at risk'.

She said that addressing the fundamental misunderstanding and fear that governs such decisions was her priority in ensuring that an already vulnerable community did not suffer further.

She said: 'In order to understand what’s happening you have to understand the community. Vickery Meadows is 3 square miles and 25,000 people living in 94 multi-family complexes.

'It’s a high-density population and the average income is very low. There is a high number of immigrant families and a lot of agencies place refugees there because of the affordable houses.'

She said that the cultural diversity which meant that an estimated 40 languages and dialects are spoken in this small area presented real challenges when trying to disseminate vital information.

Ms Staubach Gates was instrumental in pushing for the family at the center of the crisis to be relocated from their cramped and contaminated apartment.

She said she has spoken to an 'enormously relieved' Louise Troh on Friday shortly before she was relocated. That apartment has now been decontaminated in two phases and at an estimated cost of $65.000.

Ms Staubach Gates said she did not know whether the family would ever return to the apartment and that the details of what might happen once their ordeal is resolved have not yet been discussed.
