Jose Mourinho has admitted Fernando Torres' Blues career could be drawing to a close as AC Milan intensify their attempts to sign the striker. 

And the Blues boss confirmed Diego Costa is a huge doubt for the clash against Everton with a hamstring injury.

Talking on Torres, Mourinho said: 'If he wants to leave, I believe it's because he wants to try a new life, possibly a new league.

On his way? It looks more and more likely that Fernando Torres will leave Chelsea in the coming days 

Hopeful: Diego Costa is racing against time to be fit for Chelsea's trip to Everton on Saturday

'What we have clear as a club is we need three strikers to face season. He's one. I like him as a person and player. 

'If he wants to leave - and I have not heard that from him - any possibility would be analysed.

'But if he leaves in the last hour of the market then we are in trouble because we believed we were finished in the market.'

Costa will be given every opportunity to to prove his fitness ahead of the trip to Goodison Park, and Mourinho revealed he's relieved the niggle isn't anything more serious. 

'We will see today, if the reaction is positive he can come to Everton,' the manager added. 'If not we don't select him.

'It's a better scenario than for a few weeks, but tomorrow is a big game.' 

Not mincing his words: Manager Jose Mourinho confirmed that Costa is a 'big doubt' 

The clash on Merseyside is Romelu Lukaku's first chance to face his ex-employers, but Mourinho holds no ill-feeling towards the Belgian, who had made it clear he wanted to leave the club.  

'He is happy and that's the most important thing,' Mourinho said. 'He wants to be first choice - he was happy there last season. 

'He's a young kid, he wants to play and has a big career in front of him.'
