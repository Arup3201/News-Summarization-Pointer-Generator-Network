A woman has turned to Facebook in a bid to track down her father, who met her mother in a Florida club three decades ago as he worked as a drummer in a band.

Jennifer Coker, a married mother of three young boys living in Tifton, Georgia, posted an image to her Facebook page showing her holding a sign with the few details she knows about her dad.

'Please help!' she wrote on a poster. 'My name is Jennifer and I am searching for a
 needle in a haystack, my biological father.'

In the image, which has been shared 
more than 34,000 times since April 1, she explains that she has never met him, nor has
 she seen a picture of him.

Search: Jennifer Coker shared this image to Facebook in a bid to track down her biological father

Her mother, Lori, has only been able to give her scant information.

She knows that he went by the name of 'Bobby Yaeger', but Coker worries that he could have adopted that as his stage name.

She also believes he was in the band at the Imperial Lounge with a cousin named 'Mike Malarba' - but she is not sure of the spelling of the names.

'The only info I have
 on him is he was in Tampa, Florida around June/July 1980,' she wrote. 'He is between 
55-65 years old and has a tattoo of a tweety bird.'

Family: She is pictured in 1982 with her mom Lori, who met her dad in a Tampa bar when he was in a band

She did not reveal where the Tweety tattoo is - but her mother wrote on Facebook that 'it is NOT on his arm', without revealing further details.

'I have searched & searched for him,' her mother Lori wrote. 'I am TRULY sorry I know nothing more. I wish I would have gotten more info about him. I hate myself sooooooo much for this.'

As Coker shared the photograph to Facebook, she asked that others help spread the word.

'Please share this and
 help me,' she wrote. 'I feel like this is my last chance to find him. Thank you.'

Speaking to WFTS, Coker explained that she wanted her father to know that he has a daughter and three grandsons. She also wants to fill gaps in her medical history knowledge - and her life.

Today: Coker, a married mother of three, said she is looking for her father to fill a void she has felt since she was small. She also wants to let him know he has a daughter and three grandsons

'I just want to fill that void, that emptiness that I have,' she said.

She added that she has wondered who her father was since she was in kindergarten but that her previous attempts to track him down have been fruitless.

She said she wants nothing from her father and simply wants to know who he is and what he looks like.

Coker said she accepts that this effort may also not work out, saying: 'I may never know.'

But so far it looks promising. After posting her picture to her Facebook
 page, as well a special group set up for the search, it has been shared
 more than 34,000 times.

Scene: He once played at the Imperial Lounge, which was at this site in Tampa before it closed

'I am having such an OVERWHELMING response to the post I posted about finding my biological father, I can't keep up with the amount of messages I am receiving,' she wrote on Facebook.

The Imperial Club Lounge where her parents met has now closed.
