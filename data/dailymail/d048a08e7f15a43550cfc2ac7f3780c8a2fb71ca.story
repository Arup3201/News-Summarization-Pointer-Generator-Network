Anas Iqbal who is on trial at Snaresbrook Crown Court along with four others accused of grooming young girls

A gang of men groomed young girls from troubled backgrounds before sexually assaulting them and forcing them into prostitution, a court heard today.

Naeem Ahmed, 25, Nabeel Ahmed, 24, and his brother Jameel, 24, Anas Iqbal, 25, and Hassan Raza, 23, allegedly targeted six girls, three of whom lived in care homes, between January and December last year.

They were given drugs and alcohol before being passed on to other men for sex, Snaresbrook Crown Court heard.

One girl claims she was pinned down on a bed by one of the men so another two could rape her.

The same girl, who was 17 at the time, claims Naeem Ahmed, promised to be her boyfriend if she let him sell her to other men for money.

The court heard she did it ‘because I thought I was in love with him and wanted to make him happy.’

In the following months Naeem, known as Ricky, pimped her out to his pals sometimes for just £20 a time, a jury heard.

The gang tried to recruit other girls from the care system but when they refused to have sex with them they told Ricky’s girlfriend she would have to do it instead to ‘show him she was his top girl,' prosecutor Kate Bex said.

The court heard that the gang told a teenage girl she could work for them if she had a threesome.

A teenage girl was allegedly told: 'It’s just a bit of fun, we’re all friends here.'

The court also heard how Raza forced the 18-year-old to strip while he took pictures of her on his mobile phone.

He attempted to tear her clothes off and shouted 'Why aren't you f**king smiling,' it is claimed.

The gang’s activities only came to light after the girls confided in care workers at the home who were concerned they may have become involved in prostitution.

It took time to identify them because the victims did not know the full names of the men and they often used English pseudonyms.

It then emerged they had been questioned by officers in May 2012 after they were accused of raping an 18-year-old girl who they picked up after seeing her row with a friend.

Two more girls, aged 16 and 17, later came forward claiming they had also been abused by the gang after being offered a lift by them.

The younger girl alleges she was raped five times by Iqbal after being plied with booze and cocaine while her friend claims he also tried to rape her.

The five men now face 17 charges between them including sexual assault, rape, inciting child prostitution, paying for the sexual services of a child and controlling a child prostitute.

The alleged offences mostly took place at a house in Chadwell Heath, east London, but the girls say they were also taken to hotels in Ilford and Barking for sex.

The girls, who cannot be identified for legal reasons, claim on many occasions the men did not use any contraception.

Two of the girls were also forced to pose for nude pictures which the gang took on their mobile phones, jurors were told.

Opening the case, prosecutor Miss Bex said: 'This case is about the sexual exploitation of young girls by the defendants.

'All of these girls are from difficult, troubled backgrounds and are vulnerable young people.

'They share many of the same characteristics; the majority have no concept of self worth, they have been deprived of material possessions, love and often both.

'The men concerned in the grooming of such young people pray on this. They are fully aware that they have been starved of affection and use this as a way to feed their own criminal means and as a tool to exploit them.'

Referring to a report made by a care worker to the police Miss Bex said: 'He describes how these young people have never received any therapeutic intervention or help and that as a result they struggle emotionally and may be incapable of giving or receiving love, making them vulnerable to predators and manipulators.

'From the work he has done in the past 10 years he is able to say that these vulnerable people have not experienced warmth and affection and that because of their past experiences sexual contact is often viewed as affection.'

Under the law girls are classed as children if they are forced into prostitution before they are 18.

The men, all from Essex and east London, deny the charges.

The case continues.

Sorry we are unable to accept comments for legal reasons.
