A team of zoo keepers in Sydney channelled their animal instincts and hammed it up in front of the camera in a series of pictures that have gone viral.

The tongue-in-cheek snaps of staff at Symbio Wildlife Park in Helensburgh, about 50kms south of Sydney, have found their way into news feeds and timelines across the globe. 

The first picture was of four keepers mimicking a quarter of marmoset monkeys, and has now expanded to include recreations of their favourite kangaroo, koala and tiger poses.
