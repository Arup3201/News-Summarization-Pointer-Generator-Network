A trip to the optician saved a little boy's life after an eye test revealed cancer in both his eyes.

Will and Georgina Plant took their son, Benjamin, for an appointment after noticing a 'cat's eye' reflection in his pupils.

The optician was so concerned she immediately phoned the local hospital to refer the one-year-old to a specialist, who later diagnosed retinoblastoma in both his eyes.

Luckily the tumours were spotted early enough and Benjamin is expected to survive and retain his vision.

Benjamin Plant was diagnosed with retinoblastoma after his parents, Will and Georgina, took him to the optician with a 'cat's eye' reflection in his eyes

Praising the optician who spotted the symptoms, Mrs Plant said: 'If it hadn't been for her speed of action we might not be in the same position now.

'The main message I would like to give to other parents is, if you have any concerns at all, go and get your child checked out.'

Mrs and Mrs Plant, of Royal Wootton Bassett, Wiltshire, first noticed the reflection in their son's eyes last spring.

Unbeknown to them, it is a classic sign of retinoblastoma - a fast-growing form of cancer which develops in the cells of the retina.

They took Benjamin to the local branch of Haine and Smith in their town and were immediately referred to hospital, despite it being the May Bank Holiday weekend.

Mr Plant said: 'I asked my optometrist at Haine and Smith to look at Benjamin's right eye because we were concerned about an odd, cats eye reflection that we had noticed intermittently and under very specific lighting conditions and angles.

The tell-tale signs of retinoblastoma most commonly include a white reflection in the pupil often noticed in photographs or dim lighting (file picture - left eye is affected)

'On seeing something extremely serious that needed immediate investigation, the optometrist stayed on late to prepare a referral letter, and even phoned the hospital on the Sunday to ensure Benjamin was seen by the ophthalmologist as soon as possible.'

An examination at the Great Western Hospital in Swindon revealed a loss of sight in Benjamin's right eye that his parents had previously been unaware of.

After an examination under anaesthetic the family were referred to a specialist retinoblastoma clinic at the Royal London Hospital.

Retinoblastomas are graded based on their position and size, with a grade A being the least and E the most dangerous.

The optician was so worried about Benjamin that he was immediately referred to Great Western Hospital, in Swindon. He was found to have cancer in both his eyes and has had to have six cycles of chemotherapy

Doctors graded Benjamin's right eye at D and the tumour in his left eye as an A because it had been caught early.

He has undergone a six-cycle course of chemotherapy and been given a greater than 99 per cent chance of survival.

Doctors expect the vision to be saved in his left eye and say there is a 50/50 chance of saving his right eye and any remaining vision.

He has now completed his chemotherapy but is continuing to go to London every four to six weeks for monitoring and further treatment.

Mr Plant added: 'Benjamin has coped well with all the trips to and from hospital and despite his illness is a lively, happy boy.'

Retinoblastoma develops in the cells of the retina - the light-sensitive lining of the eye - and generally affects children before the age of five.

The tell-tale signs most commonly include a white reflection in the pupil often noticed in photographs or dim lighting.

Children may also have a new squint, a change of colour to the iris or a red, sore or swollen eye without infection.

Retinoblastoma is a rare type of eye cancer that usually affects children under the age of five.

As it is usually caught early in the UK, 98 per cent of children with the disease are successfully treated.

About 50 children develop the cancer every year in the UK.

Retinoblastoma is a cancer of the retina - the light-sensitive lining at the back of the eye.

It can affect one or both eyes.

In about 40 per cent of cases it is caused by a faulty gene - this can be inherited from the parents or may randomly develop.

Small tumours can usually be treated with laser treatment or freezing treatment.

Larger tumours require chemotherapy or surgery.

The most common symptoms are the pupil looking like a cat's eye, and the child developing a squint.

The cat's eye look is most commonly seen in photos.
