A collection of eight New York bartenders has shared what it's like to 'sit back and enjoy the show' of couples who meet on the mobile phone app Tinder meet each other in their restaurants.

Tinder, through which prospective couples can arrange dates if they both 'like' each other, now makes 10million matches a day, sending users into bars to see each other in person.

Patrons may not want to add any extra pressure by having their meetup become a spectacle, but bartenders are adept at knowing when a couple comes in on a Tinder date, according to a video from The Daily Share.

Eight bartenders explained what it is like to watch some of the dating app Tinder's 10million matches a day meet each other for the first time

The restaurant workers agreed that they could always tell when a couple had met online and enjoyed watching the show

'Usually they're dressed a little bit too well and they're showered a little bit too recently' said Bryan, who works at The Jakewalk in Brooklyn. 

Bartenders said they text their coworkers and other bartenders they know when they see a particularly entertaining date.

While Tinder date customers look to end their loneliness, they also often recruit a friendly bartender to their side to share the awkwardness of their first encounter with a potential new flame. 

Kerryn, who works at Greenpoint Heights,  said that once a woman arranged to touch her forehead to signal if her date did not look like his picture on the app. She ended up vigorously smacking her brow.

Bad dates sometimes end with one of the parties simply taking off when the other is going to the bathroom, leaving bartenders to break the news that the date had been ended to the other customer. 

Another woman told her date that she was leaving to go find her missing glove, but never came back. 

Junior, who works at the Brooklyn bar Commonwealth, said that seeing failed goodbye kisses is like 'watching a dog get put down'

Goodbyes may be the most dramatic part of the first date ordeal, with multiple bartenders saying that women often turn their head to the side when a man goes in for a kiss.

'It's a heartbreaker. It's like watching a dog get put down,' said Junior, who works at Commonwealth. 

But a lack of connection doesn't deter some app-users. 

One bartender named Carla said that she once saw a woman bring in three Tinder dates to her restaurant in the same night, according to Your Tango. 

Other customers on bad dates will use their dating app again before even saying goodbye to a failed romance. 

The bartenders said it feels rewarding when the dates go well, even if it sometimes ends up with customers wildly displaying their new-found affection in public.

The best dates from the amount of laughter, said Kerryn.
