North Korean leader Kim Jong-un was today rumoured to be expecting his second child after his wife appeared in public in a maternity dress.

Speculation mounted after onlookers noticed Ri Sol-ju wearing what appeared to be the same loose-fitting outfit she wore before the birth of their daughter in late 2012.

A photograph of her attending a recent sporting event that featured on the front of the state-run Rodong Sinmun newspaper suggests she has also put on weight.

Are they expecting? Rumours have grown that Kim Jong-Un's wife Ri Sol-Ju is pregnant again after she was spotted wearing what appeared to be same maternity dress she wore before the birth of their first child (left) during a public event last week (right). These two images were published by a South Korean newspaper

Pictures of Ri apparently wearing the dress last week and during her first pregnancy have also been published on the website of South Korean newspaper The Chosun Ilbo.

Observers say Kim Jong-Un, 31, who is believed to 
also have a daughter with another woman, will be desperately hoping for a
 male heir to continue the family's dictatorship.

Toshimitsu Shigemura, a professor at Tokyo's Waseda University and an authority on North Korean affairs, told The Daily Telegraph: 'There have been rumours that Ri is pregnant again for a few weeks now.

'This
 is not really a surprise as Kim needs a son as a successor for the 
dynasty that has ruled North Korea since it was founded by his 
grandfather, Kim Il-sung.

'It's absolutely impossible that a daughter could take over as leader, so his wife needs to give birth to a son.'

Ri, previously the lead singer with Ponchonbo Electronic Ensemble, has been out of the spotlight in recent weeks, like she was during her first pregnancy.

In March last year, speculation grew 
that she had given birth after photographs seen on North Korean TV 
showed her wearing a neatly-fitting two-piece skirt suit in contrast to 
the loose-fitting clothing she was seen wearing in the December before.

With
 no official confirmation, the only other evidence of the birth came in 
September when basketball star Dennis Rodman said he held the baby girl 
during a visit to the country.

Will he give up the smoking? A former playmate revealed over the weekend how Jong-Un is a Hollywood-obsessed playboy who grew up with the lavish excesses of a rock-star childhood

Kim, who is often seen smoking in public, may have to re-assess his habits if he does become a father again.

According
 to an interview with a former playmate over the weekend, Jong-Un is a 
Hollywood-obsessed playboy who grew up with the lavish excesses of a 
rock-star childhood.

Kenji 
Fujimoto, 66, recalled a child who learned to drive his own Mercedes at 
the age of seven, who downed whole bottles of vodka and was a secret 
smoker in his teenage years.

Fujimoto
 spent more than a decade as head chef and confidant of Un's father and 
the countryâ€™s late dictator Jong Il before escaping North Korea in 2001.
