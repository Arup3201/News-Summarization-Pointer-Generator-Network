Hacked: The Old Bailey was told that Sven-Goran Eriksson had his phone hacked by the News Of The World for almost his entire time as England manager

Sven-Goran Eriksson had his phone 
hacked by the News of the World for most of his reign as England 
football manager, a court heard yesterday.

A private investigator working for the
tabloid targeted him for four years, listening to messages about his 
fling with Football Association secretary Faria Alam as well as 
discussions on players.

The Old Bailey heard that Glenn 
Mulcaire was paid £100,000 to hack phones by the tabloid and was tasked 
with intercepting the England boss’s voicemails between May 2002 and 
June 2006.

During that time Eriksson, now 65, 
became the subject of several high profile stories, including one about 
his affair with Miss Alam.

Police found scrawled notes detailing 
Miss Alam’s London address, phone number and references to resetting the
personal identification number of her voicemail box in June 2004.

A 
month later, the News of the World broke the story of ‘Sven’s secret 
affair’ featuring salacious details about their romance.

It was followed a week later with the story that Miss Alam was also sleeping with FA executive Mark Palios.

The prosecution pointed to a number of
alleged incidents of hacking, claiming each had occurred shortly before
a major story about Eriksson in the News of the World.

In January 2006, Mulcaire hacked his phone five times in three days, the court heard.

The court was told that Glenn Mulcaire, left, monitored Eriksson and his lover Faria Alam, right, between 2002 and 2006, leading to several high-profile stories

Job: The England boss's phone was also hacked just a day before his team were due to kick-off their 2006 World Cup campaign, the jury was told

Two days later, Eriksson was exposed 
in a sting by News of the World undercover reporter Mazher Mahmood, 
known as the Fake Sheikh, who duped the manager into making a string of 
indiscreet remarks about his future as England boss.

Earlier, the court 
heard that on April 12, 2002 a mystery woman claiming to be the mother 
of Milly Dowler called a recruitment agency the News of the World 
suspected of employing the missing 13-year-old.

This was after Mulcaire had hacked 
Milly’s voicemails and found a message about a job interview which had 
been left in error by agency staff.

Partnership: The court heard that after the expose of Eriksson's affair, several stories followed - including Miss Alam's thoughts on his then partner Nancy Dell'Olio, right

Dell'Olio was left embarrassed last night when a prankster wearing a Sven-Goran Eriksson mask followed her into the Shaka Zulu restaurant in Camden, north London

Go away; Dell'Olio, who split with the football coach in 2007, did not appear to be amused by the mystery man donning a mask of her former partner

A team of reporters chasing the false 
lead camped outside the home of the agency boss, the Old Bailey heard.

Valerie Hancox said a co-worker received a call from a woman who said: 
‘We know what’s going on with Milly Dowler and we believe she’s working 
for you. I’m her mother and I want to know where she is.’

Milly’s parents were not told about 
the News of the World story until April 13, so her mother could not be 
the caller. Milly’s body was discovered five months later. She had been 
abducted and murdered.

Former News of the World editors 
Rebekah Brooks and Andy Coulson, both 45, former head of news Ian 
Edmondson, 44, and the tabloid’s former managing editor Stuart Kuttner, 
73, all deny conspiring with others to hack phones.

Brooks further denies two allegations 
of conspiracy to pervert the course of justice – one with her former 
personal assistant Cheryl Carter, 49, and a second with her husband 
Charles, 50,  and former News International head of security Mark Hanna,
50. They also deny the charges.

Brooks denies two counts of conspiring
to commit misconduct in public office, linked to alleged inappropriate 
payments to public officials.

Coulson denies two allegations that he
conspired with the News of the World’s former royal editor Clive 
Goodman, 56, to commit misconduct in public office.

The trial continues.

Andy Coulson, pictured, was described as being 'very ambitious but not ruthless' by one of his oldest friends Dean Keyworth who gave evidence at the Old Bailey today

Former News of the World editor Andy Coulson is 'very ambitious but not ruthless', the jury in his trial for alleged phone hacking has heard from one of his oldest friends.

Dean Keyworth told the Old Bailey that he had met Coulson while he was a 19-year-old journalism student - before he embarked on a successful career in the media and later politics.

Coulson, 45, denies conspiring with others to hack phones between October 3, 2000 and August 9, 2006 during the time he worked at the now-defunct tabloid.

Mr Keyworth told the jury: 'He is a very loyal friend and despite becoming extremely busy and very important he retained his friendships, he took care of them and the few people who were close to him.

'He is very ambitious but I don’t think he is ruthless,' the witness said, adding that Coulson 'wanted to get the story but not at any cost'.

The witness also said the two would have fun in nightclubs and at celebrity parties during Coulson’s time as editor of showbiz column Bizarre.

He described his friend of 26 years as 'self-deprecating' and someone who 'played himself down'.

The court heard that Mr Keyworth met with then editor of the NotW Rebekah Brooks in April 2002 when she was on holiday in Dubai with her former husband Ross Kemp.

Coulson, who was NotW deputy editor at the time and who the court has previously heard was in a secret relationship with his boss Brooks, put his friend and lover in contact so that he could arrange a stay for her and Mr Kemp at the seven star Burj Al-Arab hotel.

Mr Keyworth said he had met Brooks, then known as Rebekah Wade, for drinks and then lunch at a time when, the court was told, the NotW was investigating the disappearance of schoolgirl Milly Dowler by hacking into her voicemail.

However, he claimed he had mainly spoken to Kemp about soap opera Eastenders, which the actor and television presenter had left months before.

Mr Kemp, who shot to fame with his role as 
hard man Grant Mitchell, was pleased that he had been moved to the Burj 
Al-Arab because he liked the Hermes toiletries the hotel offered to 
guests, Mr Keyworth told the jury.

Mr Keyworth said he had met Rebekah Brooks in April 2002 while she was on holiday in Dubai with her former husband, actor Ross Kemp. The couple are pictured here together in 2002

Mr Keyworth said he had seen Brooks talking on the phone with the NotW office on April 13, the date when, the court has heard, the newspaper took evidence obtained from Milly's voicemail to Surrey Police

Answering questions from prosecutor Andrew Edis QC, Mr Keyworth said he had seen Brooks talking on the phone with the NotW office on April 13, the date when, the court has heard, the newspaper took evidence obtained from Milly’s voicemail to Surrey Police.

However, he said he had not heard what Brooks, who he had met previously at birthday parties, was talking about.

He said that she had got up from the table 'a couple of times' to talk on the phone, but was mainly listening rather than talking.

The prosecution claims that the decision to inform the police about what turned out to be a false lead found on the voicemail a day after it was hacked by private investigator Glenn Mulcaire was taken at the highest level.

Yesterday, Mr Keyworth’s friend William Hennessy, who also met Brooks on the same holiday, claimed that he had heard her mention 'the missing Surrey schoolgirl' at the time.

Brooks, 45, of Churchill, Oxfordshire, denies conspiring with others to hack phones between October 3, 2000 and August 9, 2006.

Mulcaire has admitted hacking phones.
