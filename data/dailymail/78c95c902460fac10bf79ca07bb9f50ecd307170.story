Supermarket Asda has defended a 'wearable England flag' it has launched for the World Cup after claims it resembles a Ku Klux Klan outfit.

The £3 St George’s Cross, with the word 'England' emblazoned across it, features a hood which Asda said was to allow fans to stay dry in the unpredictable British weather.

But some fans took to Twitter today to point out the similarities between the hoods and those worn by the racist US organisation, also known by its initials 'KKK'.

Asda customers say the new 'Wearable England Flag' looks like the notorious uniform of the Ku Klux Klan

The supermarket insists the outfit is merely designed to allow fans to watch England come rain or shine

One website user called Kieran posted a picture of himself at his @KieranCPhoto account, writing: 'Asda are selling wearable England flags, they look dodgy to say the least...'

Another user called Simon replied on his account: ''ENGLAND RULES OKKK' Honestly, do Asda simply not bother to see how these things look when worn? *sigh*'

The flag’s description on the Asda website simply says: 'Support England in the World Cup with this unique wearing flag!'

A company 
spokesman said it had also produced a wearable Brazilian flag ahead of
 the competition, with starts in the South American country on June 12.

Shoppers took to the Twitter today to point out the sinister similarity of the World Cup outfit

The spokesman said: 'We know there’s chatter on Twitter about our wearable World Cup flags, but it’s simply a flag with a hood - nothing more, nothing less.

'We opted for a hood on our wearable England and Brazilian flags as you never know what the British weather will bring.

'We want customers to get behind the team without getting wet.'

In September last year, the supermarket giant was forced to make a £25,000 donation to the mental health charity Mind after apologising for advertising an 'mental patient fancy dress costume'.

The costume - comprising a ragged, blood-spattered straitjacket and pictured being worn by a model covered in blood and brandishing a machete - was on sale for £20 through the supermarket's clothing arm George.

Asda has dismissed the mocking tweets and insist the hood was merely added to keep fans dry

The Ku Klux Klan was a racist organisation set up in Tennessee, southern USA in 1866 to resist plans to create racial equality.

Believing in white supremacy, the group's members terrorised leaders, both back and white, who called for greater integration.

Confederate general Nathan Bedford Forrest was the first leader, or 'grand wizard', and presided over a hierarchy of 'grand dragons', 'grand titans' and 'grand cyclopses'.

Members of the Ku Klux Klan at a cross burning in the 1960s, the organisation has since all but died out

Member's wore white costumes with masks and conical hats designed to scare opponents and hide their identities.

After dying out in the 1870s, the group was reformed around 1915 and took up the sign of the burning cross at rallies.

Partly fuelled by fears over immigration from the First World War and Russian revolution in Europe, the group swelled to its largest ever size of around 4million members in the 1920s.

Despite a slight resurgance during the civil rights struggles of the 1960s, the group has slowly died away and is now thought to have fewer than 5,000 members.
