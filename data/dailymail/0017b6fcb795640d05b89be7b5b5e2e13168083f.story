The world's most expensive Valentine’s Day menu has been unveiled today, with the extravagant dinner costing a stomach-churning £61,000.

Michelin starred chef Adam Simmonds came up with the eight-course menu for a ‘no expense-spared’ romantic.

It comes with almus white caviar worth £3,000, Natives South Sea oysters including pearls at a cost of £6,000, £2,000 worth of gold leaf and truffles costing £1,000.

It also features bluefin tuna, which some wildlife campaigners claim are 
as close to extinction as the panda or white rhino, but an alternative course of Pickled Mackerel, Cucumber, Horseradish and Charcoal is available should the customer have sensitivities around the fish.

The most expensive Valentine's Day menu ever was unveiled today featuring a stomach-churning price tag of £61,000

A number of the ingredients, including watermelon, are supposed to share similarities with Viagra.

And these aphrodisiacs may come in handy when it comes to the extensive drinks menu, which come courtesy of Corney & Barrow.

To wash the food down, there is a £17,000 bottle of La Romanee-Conti wine and a magnum of 1976 Salon Blanc de Blancs worth £3,000. In total, the wine bill alone costs a wallet-busting £30,700.

The Valentine’s Day dinner was 
unveiled by the luxury website VeryFirstTo.com, which teamed up with 
Adam Simmonds and GreatBritishChefs.com.

Adam
 said 'Each dish has been created with romance in mind and to allow the 
spectacular ingredients to work their magic, in both creating delicious 
food and the perfect mood for romance.'

Chef Adam Simmonds designed the eight-course menu, that includes almus white caviar worth £3,000, South Sea pearls (right) at a cost of £6,000, £2,000 worth of gold leaf and truffles costing £1,000

The meal also comes with confit foie gras, smoked eel, rissotto with carbineros prawns, saffron and silver leaf. 

The finale of the meal is vanilla and smoked chocolate with kopi luwak ice cream. 

Marcel Knobil, founder of VeryFirstTo, added: 'The menu awakes all the senses and the luxury element further intensifies the pleasure of this meal. 

'VeryFirstTo will also be enhancing the experience by covering the table in rose petals; releasing a dozen white doves, lighting 50 rose scented candles, and entertaining the couple with a harpist and a romantic poet.'

Workers harvesting bluefin tuna from Maricultura's tuna pens near Ensenada, Mexico

Bluefin are the largest tuna and can live up to 40 years. They migrate across oceans and can dive more than 4,000 feet.

Bluefin tuna are made for speed: built like torpedoes, have retractable fins and their eyes are set flush to their body.

They are tremendous predators from the moment they hatch, seeking out schools of fish like herring, mackerel and even eels.

They hunt by sight and have the sharpest vision of any bony fish.

There are three species of bluefin: Atlantic (the largest and most endangered), Pacific, and Southern. Most catches of the Atlantic bluefin tuna are taken from the Mediterranean Sea, which is the most important bluefin tuna fishery in the world.

The Atlantic bluefin is a highly sought-after delicacy for sushi and sashimi in Asia—a single fish has sold for over $1.75 million! Driven by such high prices, fishermen use even more refined techniques to catch tuna. And the fish are disappearing as a result. Although tuna do provide food and livelihoods for people, they are more than just seafood. Tuna are a top predator in the marine food chain, maintaining a balance in the ocean environment.

In the Mediterranean, WWF has been working for over 10 years to protect Atlantic bluefin tuna. We work to stop overfishing and ensure recovery of the Eastern Atlantic and Mediterranean stock. WWF has been very influential in most of the decisions made by the International Commission for the Conservation of Atlantic Tunas (ICCAT), the body that regulates the fisheries.
