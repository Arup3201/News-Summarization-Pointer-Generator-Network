A wealthy British expat turned into a ‘sex-crazed monster’ after luring women to his upmarket apartment on the French Riviera, a court heard today. 

Robert Dolby, a 74-year-old described by one of his victims as a ‘lonely pensioner’, appeared at Alpes-Maritime Assizes, in Nice, accused of murder, attempted murder and rape. 

If convicted he faces life in prison.

Wealthy British expat Robert Dolby, 74, described by one of his victims as a ‘lonely pensioner’, appeared at the Alpes-Maritime Assizes court, in Nice (pictured) accused of murder, attempted murder and rape

He is said to have killed a woman he invited to dinner in 2010, and then is said to have sexually assaulted and then tried to strangle another victim in 2012.

The crimes are said to have taken place in Dolby’s flat in Beausoleil, the Riviera resort town just outside Monaco, and at another apartment nearby.

On February 25 2012, a 29-year-old Frenchwoman identified only as Cindy was found nude in the Beausoleil apartment block, with her nose broken, and covered in blood and bruises.

‘Dolby tried to kill me,’ Cindy told investigators, confirming she had met her alleged attacker in the bar of a Monte Carlo hotel.

‘When he complained about being lonely, I felt sorry for him,’ Cindy told the court, saying he had originally been ‘like a father figure to me.’

She said the ‘reassuring, protective, thoughtful’ Dolby originally became a friend, and she soon accepted his offer to move into the flat he had shared with his wife up until her death in 2009.

But, after she moved in as a ‘lodger’, Cindy said Dolby turned into a very different character with a ‘weird grin and the voice of a monster’.

She said that within a few days of her becoming a lodger, Dolby entered her bedroom naked and ‘raped me and tried to strangle me’.

‘I fought with all my might,’ said Cindy. ‘He beat me all over. He tried to break my neck. Without the help of a neighbour, I would be dead.’

The British neighbour, who has not been named, confirmed the account, saying he had ‘heard a primal scream, like an animal being killed.’

The neighbour said Dolby was a ‘strange man’ who liked to boast about his numerous conquests, especially after his wife died from cancer.

Dolby, who denies all the charges, admitted that he often met Russian women in bars, but his sexual relations were consensual.

When police began to investigate Cindy’s complaint, they uncovered evidence linking Dolby with another crime in in 2010.

It was in that year that a 60-year-old woman identified only as Annie-Claude died in his former home in Roquebrune-Cap-Martin, also on the Riviera.

Annie-Claude’s death was initially blamed on a cardiac arrest after a night of heavy drinking, with her body found half-naked on Dolby’s couch.

But when her body was exhumed for further investigation, toxicology tests found traces of Zolpidem – a powerful sleeping pill often prescribed to people suffering from insomnia.

Irene, another witness in the case, today described how spending an evening with Dolby was ‘the worst life of my life’.

The young Russian woman said ‘Robert’s voice changed, his faced took on a horrible expression. He threw me on the carpet, and gave me a brutal head butt. I sensed he was going to kill me.’

Irene said Dolby was ‘obsessed by sex’, and often used to spend the whole day in bed.

Judge Michele Lis-Schaal today outlined how Dolby had a long list of previous convictions for crimes committed in the UK.

In 1991, he was found guilty for sexually assaulting a work colleague and sentenced to four years in prison. He also has more than a dozen previous convictions, mostly for theft and burglary.

The case, which is expected to conclude at the end of the week, continues.
