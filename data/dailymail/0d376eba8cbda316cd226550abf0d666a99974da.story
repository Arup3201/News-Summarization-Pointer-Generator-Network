River users say Asboy (pictured) is taking after his notorious father Asbo, who attacked boats

Rowers thought it was safe to return to the river after a swan, named Mr Asbo, who terrorised them three years was finally moved.

But now people living by the River Cam in Cambridge say his son is following in the aggressive swan's footsteps - and they have already nicknamed him Asboy.

They say the young swan is taking an active interest in boats and has the same 'cocky' nature as his dad.

Mr Asbo was moved to a secret location by the river authorities last year after his attacks on rowers escalated.

Oarsmen reported he would plough into them in 'drone-style' attacks and bite their arms and legs.

Although Asboy is yet to attack any rowers, some believe it is only a matter of time.

Steve Austin, 65, who has lived near The Plough pub in Fen Ditton, Cambridge for about 10 years, believes Asboy is capable of the same level of violence that his father was known for.

He said: 'We know this river, and it might sound stupid but we know all the animals. We see them grow up and this is the son of Asbo, no doubt about it, and we call him Asboy.

'He's just started taking an interest in the boats and he is so cocky.

'He walks into my garden, just like Mr Asbo used to, and we spar. He walks up to me with his wings out just like his dad did.

'He's not attacking the boats at the moment, but maybe that's because they did not have any young this year. He's still a young-un himself.'

The Conservators of the River Cam decided to move Mr Asbo because they said his behaviour was risking the safety of river users as well as himself.

The move, to a secret location about 60 miles away, was approved by Natural England.

The conservators declined to comment on whether they were keeping tabs on Asboy or any of Mr Asbo's other offspring.

Bill Key, president of the Cambridgeshire Rowing Association, said he had not heard of any reports of attacks on rowers.

He said: 'That part of the river has been a pleasure to row in. You might get the odd swan fluttering their feathers during mating season, but compared with what we went through it's nothing.

'That was unbelievable. I was physically attacked on more than one occasion from a height.'

Locals were repeatedly attacked by the notorious swan before he and his mate were transferred
