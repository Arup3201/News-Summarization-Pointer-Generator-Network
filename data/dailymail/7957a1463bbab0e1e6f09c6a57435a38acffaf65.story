When Anne Morshead, a couples counsellor for Relate, met her partner Liam she wasn't aware of his dependency on alcohol.

'Over the next five years I changed into someone I didn't recognise,' she writes in her new book, in which she tells the story of their relationship in Ireland. 'Someone my friends started not to recognise.

'I became physically ill, certainly emotionally distraught and I am forced to admit now what my mental capabilities were suspect as well on many occasion.'

Initially, Anne thought she could change Liam. That she could fix him. She felt his recovery depended entirely on her being there - and not only because Liam was an alcoholic, but because he was also going blind.

In Blind Drunk Anne tells the story of how they met, fell in love, tumbled into the destructive co-dependency of addict and carer, and eventually saved themselves and their relationship by having time apart.

Writing about when she and Liam first met (in a pub), Anne wonders if it was his 'helplessness' that drew her in and attracted her to him.

She says: 'Had Liam just been drunk I wonder whether we would have got entangled, but since he was blind and drunk, disadvantaged in life, presently fearful and very anxious [...] I felt for him thinking I could ease his emotional pain.'

Similarly, Anne's strong personality was a draw to Liam, who had endured an abusive relationship at the hands of his alcoholic father.

She writes: 'He had tried to cling to his mother and she probably did her best to protect him, especially as he was visually impaired.

'As a result, my guess is that he was attracted to me as a solid, older woman who had surprisingly stayed and listened to him.'

Anne expects that Liam used alcohol to drown the sorrows of a traumatic childhood and a degenerative eye condition

But Liam's blindness made their relationship trickier, with Anne often excusing his behaviour to herself and to friends, or thinking he was acting in certain ways because he couldn't see, not because he was inebriated.

'Suddenly his mood would change,' she says. 'Not to mention the staggering, knocking into furniture and falling down, but after all, I told myself, he was blind.

'His eyesight was a big stumbling block for me! Sometimes it seemed I had become the carer of a delinquent teenage rebel.'

As Liam became emotionally absent and began lying to her and hiding alcohol, Anne became angry and aggressive. Life, she says, was 'unmanageable'.

Things came to a head on 7 July 2005, the morning of the 7/7 bombings, when Anne told Liam she wouldn't see him again until he stopped drinking.

At this point Blind Drunk becomes a guide to being the partner to an alcoholic. Anne says an alcoholic must want to recover themselves, and that your insistence that they do so is simply not enough.

She advocates 'detachment': distancing yourself from your dependent and focusing instead on improving your own life.

'By detaching and leaving him to it I showed I cared. It sounds perverse but by staying, coping and being a martyr in effect, I was exercising pity and indicating Liam was a failure and had no hope of going it alone or recovering.'

And it worked. Liam benefited from their detachment, recovered, and the couple are still together.

'When they make it sobriety really is reincarnation in the same lifetime,' Anne says.

Alcohol is a drug that is extremely addictive

What to remember:

Your family member or friend is not a bad person

They crave a drug that is addictive

This addiction is probably 10% physical, 90% psychological

No one forces them to put a glass to their lips, but they never meant their lives to go down this route

Anyone can become addicted: if you drink enough for long enough, even you

Most people deny they have a problem

Denial has many sides, layers and levels to it

The drinker has a disease, and that disease is progressive

You and the whole family are affected by it

The drinker can stop, but only if they stop drinking
