Super healthy schoolboy Jack Thomas from Oakdale, South Wales, died in his girlfriend's arms while having a cup of tea

A healthy sports-mad schoolboy who died watching TV had nothing wrong with him, an inquest heard today.

Jack Thomas, 15, was photographed looking happy and smiling less than five minutes before he suddenly stopped breathing.

The keen sportsman let out a 'couple of light groans' as he sipped a cup of tea and then died in his girlfriend’s arms.

The inquest heard a post mortem examination found that Jack was 'a perfectly healthy, normal teenager' with no medical problems.

Pathologist Dr Edward Williams said: 'There was no sign of any injury and no abnormalities in the heart and arteries.'

Jack had represented Wales at Taekwondo and was an accomplished rugby player, cricketer and all round sportsman.

The inquest heard Jack, of Caerphilly, South Wales, had walked three miles to his girlfriend’s home on the day of the tragedy in February.

Jack and his girlfriend Emily Brown, 15, settled down on the settee to watch Wales play Scotland in rugby’s Six Nations.

Her father Richard Brown told the hearing: 'At half time Emily took photographs of Jack smiling and pulling faces.

'But then she realised something was wrong.

'Jack tipped his cup of tea over himself and let out a couple of light groans.'

Mr Brown carried out CPR on Jack until an ambulance arrived.

He added: 'Jack was at our home for about 40 minutes and didn’t complain of feeling unwell.'

The inquest in Newport recorded a verdict that Jack died of natural causes.

It was said 'the most likely cause of death' was cardiac arrhythmia where the heart beats out of control - but leaves no trace that can be seen in a post mortem.

Jack was 'full of life and energy' and on the day he died walked three miles to his girlfriend's home

Gwent Coroner David Bowen told the teenager’s parents: 'Jack had not been in an accident and there was no sign of drugs or alcohol in his bloodsteam.

'This may not provide you with the clear-cut answer you were looking for, but whatever it was, it was wholly natural in origin.

'Jack would have known nothing at all - there would have been no warnings.'

He was predicted to get A stars in his GCSEs this summer and had won a place at a sixth form college.

His heartbroken parents Grant and June Thomas are now campaigning for young people to be screened for potential heart defects

Mrs Thomas said: 'He was a very happy, intelligent, fun-loving young man.

'None of us will ever forget him - he’ll be in our hearts for ever.'

Electrician Mr Thomas said: 'Jack had never been ill in his life - the worst illness he’d had was tonsillitis and had his tonsils out when he was three.

'He was full of life and energy - he was a super-fit Taekwondo expert who trained six times a week.

'We as a family are in bits, words don’t even come close to to explaining how we feel.

'Jack wasn’t just my son he was my best friend. He really was the perfect son in every way.'
