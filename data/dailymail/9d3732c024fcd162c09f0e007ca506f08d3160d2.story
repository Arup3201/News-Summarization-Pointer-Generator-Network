Protocol has not always been Olympic hero Sir Bradley Wiggins’ strongest point.

But yesterday, cycling’s ‘Modfather’ was determined not to put a loafer-clad foot wrong as he was knighted by the Queen.

So much so, in fact, that when asked about meeting Her Majesty after the ceremony at Buckingham Palace, he said: ‘To be honest, it’s such a blur. I can’t remember what she said or what I said.

‘You concentrate so much on the protocol of what you have got to do, what she actually said I can’t remember now. It was more nerve-racking than the Olympics.’

Humble: Sir Bradley Wiggins was knighted by the Queen at Buckingham Palace today for services to cycling

The new Sir Bradley said he felt 'inferior' to others receving honours at Buckingham Palace today

The new Sir Bradley, who last year won Olympic gold and the Tour de France, said he felt humbled

But in typical style, the record-breaking cyclist talked down his achievements, saying he had 'just won a bike race' and felt 'a little bit inferior to everyone, really'.

The record-breaking cyclist - the first Briton to win the Tour de France who also garnered seven Olympic medals in a glittering career that saw him being crowned BBC Sports Personality Of The Year 2012, was shaking with nerves after the investiture.

But the no-nonsense father of two who is known for his sideburns and dapper brown suits, said he was still planning to attend training tonight.

Sir Bradley said: 'It was quite nerve-wracking actually. I'm just incredibly uncomfortable in those circumstances and I'm still shaking now, to be honest.

'I'm glad it's over. The Queen asked what I'm doing now, and it was an incredible summer last year.

'It's quite humbling, really, being here. I was just talking to some of the other people getting stuff, and asking them what they've been honoured for, and they're historic things, ground-breaking sciences or whatever.

Sir Bradley, who wore a trademark brown suit for the occasion, showed his medal off to Beefeaters afterwards 

'I've just won a bike race'.

He added: 'It's just the end of the road in a sense, in that it tops off the closure of last summer.  It's a great honour.'

Sir Bradley said he was not going to celebrate tonight as he was training for forthcoming races, adding: 'I'm looking forward now, trying to concentrate on the next Olympic cycle now.

'I'll probably be training this evening - it's just ongoing at the moment.'

Sir Bradley touched on the recent spate of cyclist deaths in London, saying that 'people have to help themselves'.

He said: 'With successes in the sport, more people get on bikes and obviously accidents happen.

'I think the fact that there is more publicity around it means more is being done now. There's more publicity towards cycle safety now, with people wearing helmets, being visible, etc.

'It's not going to happen overnight and people have to help themselves at the end of the day. It's a long old process.'
