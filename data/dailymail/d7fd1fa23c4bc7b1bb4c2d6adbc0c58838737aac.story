Buster Douglas, whose defeat of heavyweight boxer Mike Tyson ranks as one of the greatest upsets of all time, said that his motivation for the fight stemmed from his mother's belief in him.

Mr Douglas, who was a heavy underdog against Mr Tyson, said that his mother Lula Pearl had told him she thought he could win before she died of a stroke three weeks before the fight.

Mr Tyson, heavyweight champion of the world, was 37-0 at the time and favored at 42-1 odds to crush his opponent when they faced off in Tokyo, Japan.

Six-foot-four-inch Mr Douglas knocked him out in the 10th round.

Mr Tyson, a  soft-spoken but ferocious 5ft10in fighter, was thought to be tuning up for his match with Evander Holyfield, whose ear he would later bite in his most notorious fight. 

When the Associated Press reminded Mr Douglas that few believed in him, he talked about his mother and said, 'Yeah, but she did.' 

'I believed in myself and that I had the ability to do that. It's something that my mother instilled in me at a very young age: You can do whatever you want,' he said.  

Mr Douglas shocked the world when he won the fight despite still grieving the loss of his mother.

Someone from the crowd told the young man to win the fight for Ms Pearl right before the match.

'He planned on doing a lot of things for her after this fight coming up. He was always thinking of her,' Mr Douglas's trainer and maternal uncle J.D. McCauley said in an obituary for his sister before the Tyson match.

The 29-year-old hung in the ring with the shorter Tyson during the opening rounds by fending him off with his jab.

However Mr Douglas's Cinderella story was almost ended prematurely when he was knocked down late in the eighth round.

'He ended up catching me with a good shot. When I got up off the ground, I knew I had to get back on focus, on point, with what I was doing,' Mr Douglas, now 54, said.

He retaliated by dominating the ninth round as Mr Tyson suffered with a swollen left eye.

Mr Douglas knocking his opponent out one minute and 22 seconds into the 10th round with a quick combination of what he called 'four terrific shots'.

Though Mr Tyson's camp would dispute the result later based on the timing of Mr Douglas's eighth-round fall, the young man from Columbus, Ohio, had accomplished the impossible and handed the champ his first professional defeat.

Mr Douglas's reign as the world's top heavyweight didn't last long, however, and he was knocked out by Evander Holyfield in a Las Vegas fight eight months later.

He earned $7million from the unsuccessful defense, enough to live on comfortably.  

His body began worsening, and he almost died in the mid from a diabetic coma after allegedly ballooning to 400lbs.

He also suffered from depression, according to ESPN. 

'I was distraught. I was just in a shell. No one could understand my plight. I lost my best friend, my mother. I had really no one to turn to,' the fighter said.

After being hospitalized he lost weight and made a comeback attempt in the late 90s before retiring from professional fighting in 1999 with a record of 38-6-1.

Now slimmer and in middle age, Mr Douglas lives outside of Columbus.

He trains young boxers five days a week and also spends time with his four sons and wife Bertha. 

The coach said that he has only run into his opponent once since their match, a few years ago in Cincinnati. 

'It's not like we sat down and talked about it and (became) friends, anything like that. He was still kind of short (with me). So I didn't push it any further,' he said.

The heavyweight said that he has watched the fight on video more than 50 times, though he likes to watch it alone, according to The Japan Times.

'When I just have time to myself, I pop it in and check it out,' he said.

'The thing about it is the emotions that I was going through at the time,' Mr Douglas added.

The fighter earned $7million from his unsuccessful title defense against Evander Holyfield and moved back near his hometown

At one point Mr Douglas's weight neared 400lbs, but the boxer slimmed down before a comeback in the late 90s and now teaches the sport
