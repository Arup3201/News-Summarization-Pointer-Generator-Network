Ronnie O'Sullivan beat Graeme Dott 4-1 to progress to the semi-finals of the World Grand Prix in Llandudno, but called his performance 'diabolical'.

The 39-year-old did not reach the heights he is capable of, but was still more than good enough to get past the Scot - the man he beat to win the second of his five World Championships in 2008.

Ronnie O'Sullivan was in no mood to pat himself on the back after beating Graeme Dott

Neither man made a break of three figures and O'Sullivan missed a handful of easy-looking shots, but Dott was unable to punish him, most notably in the fourth when he missed a green off the spot as he tried to clear to level at 2-2.

O'Sullivan made him pay, but was in no mood to pat himself on the back.

'Graeme has had a good tournament, been consistent and is always a tough match,' O'Sullivan told ITV4. 'We both played poorly, I felt nervous for some reason and couldn't see the wood for the trees. It was strange, one of those evenings and it was lucky Graeme played as badly as me.

'I was sitting there thinking of how good Stephen Hendry and Steve Davis were and they started twitching, and thought 'is this my time?'. I missed so many balls, it was diabolical.

Martin Gould beat Peter Ebdon 4-2 to book a place in the last four in Llandudno

'I'm just relieved, tomorrow is another day, but you want to build momentum as this stage of a tournament.'

Earlier in the day, Martin Gould beat Peter Ebdon to ensure O'Sullivan would avoid a collision course with his old nemesis.

He called the veteran, a man who has tormented him in the past, 'Peter f****** Ebdon' in a newspaper interview this week, but Ebdon was dispatched 4-2.

O'Sullivan will face Stuart Bingham in the last four after he beat Mark Davis 4-0 in a low-scoring affair.
