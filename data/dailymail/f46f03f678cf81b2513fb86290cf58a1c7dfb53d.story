Russia's answer to high-end supermarket Waitrose has been hit by food sanctions imposed by the Kremlin, banning imports of foreign produce.

Affluent shoppers looking to buy Mediterranean tomatoes, Spanish peaches, or Italian fennel at the Azbuka Vkusa chain have been instead met with their home grown - and inferior - counterparts.

Earlier this month Russia banned all meat, fish, dairy, fruit and vegetable imports from the United States, the European Union, Norway, Canada, and Australia for one year in retaliation for the sanctions imposed by these countries over Ukraine.

The Sunday Times reports that tomatoes from southern Russia are being stocked instead of those usually imported from the Mediterranean, Norwegian salmon has been replaced by Russian smoked trout, and parma ham has also been banned in favour of a Russian meat called tagansky.

It was recently reported that the Kremlin has been urging people to eat Siberian reindeer as beef from the West disappears from Russian supermarkets.

Schools and hospitals in Chukota - a far-flung region close to Alaska where football tycoon Roman Abramovich was once governor - are to be supplied from local herds to replace American imports.

It comes as a McDonald's outlet in the Siberian city of Novosibirsk, and a Burger King in Krasnoyarsk, are the latest to be targeted by the Russian authorities in what is seen as punishment for Western sanctions.

The chains are being hid by inspections over alleged administrative or sanitary abuses, a move widely seen as having political connotations.

The Russian government has targeted Western food imports in a tit-for-tat move for sanctions imposed over the Ukraine crisis.

This has led to an embargo on meat from the US and EU.

As Scottish and American beef vanish from the shelves, TV news reports in Russia are instead strongly promoting the delights of reindeer delicacies from producers across Siberia.

'Reindeer meat is ecologically clean, and that is why neither French foie gras, nor Spanish jambon not any other foreign delicacies can compare with it,' said a Russian TV report trumpeting the benefits of home-grown produce.

In the Yamal region of northern Russia, some 70,000 reindeer will be slaughtered this year for venison, reported The Siberian Times

Supplies are now to be switched to central Russia.
