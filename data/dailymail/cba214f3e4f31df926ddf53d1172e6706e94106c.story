Thousands of hospital beds are set to be scrapped under secret plans drawn up by NHS managers.

Doctors warn the loss of so many beds will put patients at risk in an NHS that is already ‘overwhelmed’.

Cutbacks: The number of hospital beds could be cut by up to 25 per cent in some areas (stock image)

The proposals, tucked away in documents published by Trusts planning to close or downgrade A&E departments, reveal:

The plan suggests that GPs and other services will play a bigger role in providing care in the community

The disclosures come just days after 
the publication of a report warning that hospitals are ‘full to 
bursting’, with Government figures showing that 94 per cent of beds were
occupied last month – more than the recommended maximum of 85 per cent 
to ensure patient safety.

Campaigners
argue the proposed cuts are being ‘smuggled through without proper 
debate’. Dr Clare Gerada, chairwoman of the Royal  College of GPs, said:
‘I’m shocked. The NHS is heaving. We don’t have enough beds. We’ll be 
looking after sicker and sicker people in the community, with nowhere to
put them.

‘We can’t cope. Community services are stretched beyond belief. Patients will suffer in the end. We could end up with beds in corridors all over again.’

A report for NHS North West London, which was leaked to The Mail on Sunday, assesses proposals to close four out of the area’s nine casualty units. The opening page of the report, which was written by independent public-health specialist Dr David McCoy, warns that its contents should not be ‘quoted or disseminated’ and are strictly for ‘limited circulation’.

The report says the closures involve ‘a significant shift of health care activity and expenditure’, to be achieved by closing A&E wards and ‘a reduction in the number of hospital beds’.

Dr McCoy writes: ‘A potentially more serious issue than the closure of A&Es is the reduction in number of hospital beds by nearly 25 per cent .  .  . However, details of the clinical rationale and modelling used to arrive at the proposal are absent.’

He adds that ‘any shortcoming in the plans to compensate for this by strengthening and improving out-of-hospital care will have serious consequences for patients and families’.

None of the hundreds of bed closures in North-West London – mostly acute beds along with 20 paediatric and maternity – are explicitly mentioned in a 78-page consultation document supplied to local residents.

'Putting lives at risk': Campaigners argue hospitals are currently operating at full capacity and community services are already at breaking point

Dr John Lister, director of campaign 
group London Health Emergency, described the plans as ‘shockingly 
irresponsible’. He said: ‘This is being smuggled through without proper 
debate. The consultation document told local people and health 
professionals only part of the story, and kept key details tucked away 
in obscure documents. We urge a reopening of consultation and a proper 
debate with all the facts on the table.’

In
South-East London, a special administrator appointed by the Government 
to oversee changes at South London Healthcare NHS Trust, which is close 
to bankruptcy, has highlighted the need to close hundreds of beds.

The information is on page 54 of Appendix K of the administrator’s draft report and reveals there should be 618 bed closures by 2017 – 15 per cent of the current total. This includes 173 at Lewisham Hospital and 224 at Guy’s and St Thomas’ NHS Foundation Trust. However, a spokeswoman for Guy’s and St Thomas’ denied there were any plans to close beds.

Documents from a consultation in Trafford, Greater Manchester, show similar plans. The ‘pre-consultation business case’ says: ‘Hospital beds required by the population of Trafford are reduced and those beds are replaced by the extended supported care in the community.’

At Barts Health NHS Trust in East London, bed numbers are forecast to drop by 21 per cent by 2016-17.

Elsewhere in the Trust, Newham University Hospital will lose 72 beds and Whipps Cross University Hospital 138.

Karen Reissman, a nurse and Unison representative from  Bolton, said plans to reorganise health services in Manchester would also include bed losses, despite the public consultation  literature failing to explicitly mention such changes. She said: ‘They’re saying 25 per cent of  people in hospital do not need to be treated in hospital. It’s all about affordability, and it’s shocking.’

Shadow Health Secretary Andy Burnham said: ‘This reveals the full extent of the risks being taken with patient care. Hospitals are sailing dangerously close to the wind. Ministers must take urgent action to ensure patient safety.’

Katherine Murphy, chief executive of the Patients Association, said: ‘Changes should happen with patients, not simply to patients. The Government’s decision to drive through £20 billion of NHS savings is having a real impact on care. They need to rethink.’

A spokesman for NHS North West London denied the figures had been ‘hidden’, adding: ‘The figures are all given in the document and explained in detail in the appendix. We have published all these  figures on beds in 73,000 distributed copies of our consultation plan – to which we received over 17,000 responses. Modern health care means people can be better supported at home.’

A spokesman for the Health for North East London consultation, representing King George Hospital, said the bed losses could be revised lower but ‘significant reductions’ were planned. He said: ‘These relate to efficiency gains. They are not a consequence of the A&E changes. The Trust needs to bring itself back into financial balance and in line with national benchmarking around length of stay.’

@highlight

Some areas could see the number of hospital beds cut by 25 per cent

@highlight

The plans suggest GPs playing a larger role providing care in the community

@highlight

The number of patients treated in hospital will be restricted, with care increasingly provided by GPs or other services in the community.

@highlight

In North-West London, almost 800 beds – one in four – could be lost across nine hospitals.

@highlight

King George Hospital in Ilford, Essex, could see its capacity cut from 387 beds to just 47 in a few years.

@highlight

In South-East London, 618 beds are to be scrapped across seven hospitals over the next five years.

@highlight

There are also plans to slash beds in other parts of London and Manchester, but the scale of these cuts is yet to be revealed. There are likely to be similar reductions in bed numbers across the UK.
