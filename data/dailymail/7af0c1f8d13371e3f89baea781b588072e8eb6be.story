A Tibetan man died after setting himself on fire outside a Chinese government building yesterday afternoon.

Dorjee Rinchen, 58, burned to death outside the Armed Forces department in Labrang, occupied Tibet, in the second fatal self-immolation protest this week.

Security forces later clashed with mourners when they tried to bring his body back to his village in Gansu province, northwestern China.

On Monday a 50-year-old man died in Labrang after setting himself alight at a nearby monastery, whilst shouting slogans for Dalai Lama’s return to the Himalayan region.

Mr Rinchen’s death is the eight self-immolation death in ethnic Tibetan areas this month, London-based organisation Free Tibet said.

The horrific protest action has increased in the last 18 months, with 58 incidents reported since March 2011.

Chinese security forces tried to prevent local people from returning Mr Rinchen's body to his home in a nearby village, but after a brief confrontation, they were allowed to pass.

When Tibetan monks from the Labrang Monastery, the scene of Monday’s self immolation, later attempted to visit Mr Rinchen’s home to pray, they were stopped by security and forced to pray by the roadside.

Free Tibet Director Stephanie Brigden said: 'Dorjee Rinchen is the second Tibetan to set himself on fire in Labrang in two days.

'Like many Tibetans in the last eighteen months, he set himself on fire in front of a government building that symbolises China’s occupation.

'Tibetans are paying a terrible price for the Communist Party leadership’s determination to maintain stability.'

China maintains that Tibet has always been part
of its territory, but many Tibetans say the Himalayan region was 
virtually independent for centuries until Chinese troops invaded in the 
1950s.

Streets in Tibetan areas are lined with Chinese military personnel, and recent changes in education policies have seen almost all subjects in Tibetan schools now taught in Mandarin.

Beijing blames the exiled Tibetan 
spiritual leader, the Dalai Lama, for fanning anti-government sentiment 
and routinely purges monasteries and nunneries, where support for the 
Dalai Lama and Tibetan independence runs high.

The first self-immolation in 
connection with the fight for an independent Tibet was reported in 2009.

The protests, which sees individuals douse themselves in flammable liquid and set themselves alight, are reportedly inspired by the acts of Buddhist monks during the Vietnam war in the 1960s.

Tibetans currently have no legal recourse to protest against Chinese rule, making traditional demonstrations impossible.

Those who do face severe repercussions, with reports of physical assaults on Tibetans by Chinese security forces.

One recent victim, a 17-year-old girl, was beaten by security guards and given a three year prison sentence for throwing up pieces of paper calling for the 
freedom of Tibet on the street.

The escalation of self-immolation since 2011 is a result of further Chinese government clampdowns on the Tibetan people.

The Chinese response to protests has in turn fuelled further grievances, which have lead to the increase in self-immolations as the desperate Tibetans see no other way of having their voices heard, Free Tibet said.

Apart from cases where Tibetans have set themselves alight in pairs, Free Tibet have no indications that the self-immolations are anything but individuals acting on their own accord.

The controversial method of protest is much debated among Tibetans themselves. Some Buddhists say suicide is violence, and therefore unacceptable, while others see self-sacrifice for a greater cause as legitimate.
