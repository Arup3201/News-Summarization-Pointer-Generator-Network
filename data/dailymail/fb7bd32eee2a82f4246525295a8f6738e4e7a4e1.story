Doughnut chain Krispy Kreme has apologised after bizarrely branding a half-term club KKK Wednesday - the same initials used by the US race hate group the Ku Klux Klan.

A billboard at the Hull branch advertised the outlet's half-term Krispy Kreme Klub 'KKK Wednesday'.

But after details appeared on social media the company faced complaints that the initials were the same as the racist group, the Ku Klux Klan.

A Krispy Kreme doughnuts store in Hull came under fire after customers pointed out one of its half-term activities had taken the initials associated with the Ku Klux Klan

The Ku Klux Klan were a robed and hooded group known for violence against African Americans in the 19th and  20th centuries and still exists today.

Krispy Kreme created KKK Wednesday  with the store in St Stephen's Shopping Centre, Hull as part of a calendar of activities designed to keep kids occupied during half term.

But after posting the event on Facebook, readers were quick to point out the blunder.

A member of staff at the Hull branch said the advertisement had been taken down.

She said: 'We have now taken down the sign from our point of sale. We don't have a new name for the event yet but it is still going ahead this week.'

The club will allow youngsters a chance to decorate their own doughnuts and also other activities.

The store, based in the St Stephen's shopping centre in Hull (pictured), has since removed the advertising

The Krispy Kreme Klub hoped to allow children on school holidays to come to the store and decorate snacks

Krispy Kreme issued a formal apology and said: 'Krispy Kreme apologises unreservedly for the inappropriate name of a customer promotion at one of our stores.

'This promotion was never intended to cause offence. All material has been withdrawn and an internal investigation is currently under way.'

The Ku Klux Klan was a racist organisation set up in Tennessee, southern USA in 1866 to resist plans to create racial equality.

Believing in white supremacy, the group's members terrorised political leaders and campaigners, both back and white, who called for greater integration.

Confederate general Nathan Bedford Forrest was the first leader, or 'grand wizard', and presided over a hierarchy of 'grand dragons', 'grand titans' and 'grand cyclopses'.

Members wore white costumes with masks and conical hats designed to scare opponents and hide their identities.

After dying out in the 1870s, the group was reformed around 1915 and took up the sign of the burning cross at rallies.

Partly fuelled by fears over immigration from the First World War and Russian revolution in Europe, the group swelled to its largest ever size of around 4million members in the 1920s.

Despite a slight resurgence during the civil rights struggles of the 1960s, the group has slowly died away and is now thought to have fewer than 5,000 members.
