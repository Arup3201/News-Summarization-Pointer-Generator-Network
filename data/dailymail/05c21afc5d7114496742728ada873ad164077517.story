Notorious: David Aves has been jailed for 13 months after selling three vehicles he didn't own

A prolific conman has been jailed after selling three vehicles he pretended to own for £9,000 - his 158th offence.

David Aves had only been out of prison a matter of days when he sold a Kubota KX 71, a Mercedes Vito and a JCB to Mindaugas Virketis.

Despite Mr Virketis paying £9,000 into Aves's bank account, he never recieved the vehicles - because Aves didn't actually own them.

Aves, 54, of Bradfield St George, near Bury St Edmunds, Suffolk, was jailed after he admitted one count of fraud at Ipswich Crown Court.

The court heard that Aves, who was once freed after forging release papers, had only been released from jail on September 27 last year.

In total he had a string of 157 previous convictions which date back to 1976, most of which were for dishonesty.

Katherine Moore, defending, said that Aves had spent most of his adult life in and out of prison.

In mitigation she said that the defendant's mother had recently died and that his own health was failing.

But he was sentenced to 13 months in jail.

Sentencing Aves, Judge John Devaux said: 'You have proved yourself ingenious and resourceful in the past and your present offending shows little sign there has been any diminution in your behaviour.'

Aves was released from Norwich Prison in 1995 after he faxed forged released papers but later recaptured.

He also went on the run from Hollesley Prison in 2008.

The conman gained such notoriety from the sale of fraudulent farming vehicles and equipment that his photo has previously been circulated in industry publications urging farmers not to do business with him.
