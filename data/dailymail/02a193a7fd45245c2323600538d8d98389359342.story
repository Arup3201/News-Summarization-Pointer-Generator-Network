Leather pants are typically the last thing one might want to wear to work out. But a new collection from Lululemon looks set to change that.

The yoga wear chain this week launched the &go capsule on its U.S. website, designed to be as comfortable in the gym as it is chic in the office or a cocktail bar.

Comprising leggings with flattering leather-look panels ($118) and a peplum-waist top ($58), it delivers on style big time.

An open-back black top ($58) promises to be an instant wardrobe essential, while leather-look running shorts ($54, actually made from stretchy, durable Warpstreme) seem made for Downtown fashionistas.

There is even a dress ($128) with a high neckline and full skirt that will likely be a hit on and off the tennis court.

Lululemon's Chief Product Officer Tara Poseley told MailOnline that the line was designed with time-short women in mind.

'We know that every minute counts and 
that our guests want a wardrobe that carries them seamlessly from 
daybreak to midnight,' she said.

'The versatility of the &go capsule coupled with how the product makes our guests feel when they wear it connects fashion with function and is what athletic style is all about.'

Sizes for the capsule run from a U.S. 4 to 10, which may disappoint some shoppers - the largest size Lululemon currently offers is a 12.

But regardless, it is already proving popular - a number of pieces, including the dress, have already sold out online.

The collection is being tipped to help revive the troubled brand, according to financial analysts, following a tough 2013 during which it was forced to recall millions of dollars worth of 'too-sheer' yoga pants.

Camilo Lyon, an analyst at Canaccord Genuity in New York, told the Financial Post: 'Our contention has been that Lululemon must press the fashion quotient to keep competitors at bay and customers engaged.

'We believe the &go line is another great step in that direction that should serve the company and the brand well.'
