A starving boxer dog was so desperately hungry and emaciated that it was found eating a raw onion, after it was left with no food or water for weeks,

The female boxer, called Rio, was discovered just 'days from death' and on the brink of starvation at an address in Birkenhead, Merseyside.

The dog was so desperately thin that she had developed sores on her shoulders and pelvis where the bones had rubbed painfully as she had tried to lie down on the ground to sleep.

RSPCA officers also discovered the 
body of a starved dead gecko while searching the property, with no signs
 of a heat source or food or water.

Owner Kelly Gilfoyle has now been banned from keeping animals after the dog was discovered by the RSPCA in a severe state of dehydration and was found eating a raw onion - which can be poisonous to dogs.

Inspectors revealed the property, on Clifford Street, was covered in rubbish and faeces and there was no food or water to be found.

Rio was just skin and bone and was rushed to a vet who gave her a body score of just one - one being emaciated and five being obese.

Gilfoyle, 32, pleaded guilty to causing unnecessary suffering to the dog by failing to investigate and address the causes of her poor body condition and weight loss.

RSPCA Inspector Anthony Joynes said: 'Rio was on the brink of starvation and a vet who examined her said she would have died within a few days from organ failure due to the starvation and dehydration'

Appearing at Wirral Magistrates Court, Gilfoyle was banned from owning any animals for 10 years and given a 14 week prison sentence, suspended for two years.

She was also ordered to carry out 140 hours community service, a 12 month supervision order and told to pay costs of £1,740.

Speaking after the sentencing, RSPCA Inspector Anthony Joynes said: 'Rio was on the brink of starvation and a vet who examined her said she would have died within a few days from organ failure due to the starvation and dehydration.

'Since she has been in our care she has made an amazing recovery - and this is a result of us simply feeding her and giving her water.

The officer added: 'Since she has been in our care she has made an amazing recovery - and this is a result of us simply feeding her and giving her water'

'The worst thing for me was the fact that poor Rio had pressure sores on her shoulders and pelvic bones because she was so thin her bones were painfully rubbing on the ground when she laid down.

'As a result she now has scars from this awful neglect.

'Sadly cases like these do appear to be becoming more common.

'But I hope this sentence sends out a clear message that it is unacceptable to leave an animal like this and the courts will take these offences seriously.'
