As a self-confessed expert in ‘supermarket sociology’, David Cameron may have just been carrying out research for his theories on people’s shopping habits.

But just days after being called ‘stuck up’ for preferring the type of people who shop in Waitrose, the  Prime Minister popped in to a branch of value chain Asda.

Mr Cameron made a point of chatting with Ange on the fish counter, before meeting customers and hugging babies as he hailed the creation of 12,00 new jobs by the supermarket giant.

In the tradition of politicians on a walkabout, the Prime Minister found a baby to hug, 11-month-old Luca who was hopping with mum  Tara Leniston

Last week Mr Cameron made a brave intervention into the politics of the weekly shop, claiming there was ‘something about’ Waitrose customers who are more ‘engaged people’.

Labour accused the PM of making a ‘bizarre and empty-headed intervention’ at a time when many families were struggling to make ends meet.

In an apparent attempt to prove he is just as comfortable at the budget end of the market, Mr Cameron toured an Asda store in Clapham Junction, London today.

Admiring the fish counter, he tweeted a picture of himself ‘talking to Ange at Asda, a company announcing 12,000 new jobs and helping show our Long Term Economic Plan is working’.

He also toured the meat section and had a cup of coffee with some Asda staff in the store café.

In the tradition of politicians meeting ordinary members of the public, Mr Cameron also took time to hug a baby – 11-month-old Luca who was shopping with mum Tara Leniston.

Mr Cameron did not seem to struggle striking up conversation, despite his theory that people in other supermarkets usually ignore him.

Speaking last week, Mr Cameron said: ‘I have got a piece of supermarket sociology, which is that there is something about Waitrose customers ... they are the most talkative.

‘I found that if I shop in Waitrose it takes me about twice as long as everyone wants to stop you and have a chat. Whereas in other supermarkets I find I can dart round very quickly and get everything.

‘It is something about your customers, they are very talkative, engaged people.'

Mr Cameron revealed that he shops at Waitrose - regarded as a favourite of the middle classes - whenever possible.

Mr Cameron said he was 'delighted' that Asda is continuing to invest heavily in the UK

After claiming the people in Waitrose were more talkative and engaging, Mr Cameron was keen to show that staff in Asda were chatty too

On the up: Mr Cameron was in the store to promote the news that Asda is to create 12,000 new jobs over the next five years

But today he was in Asda to promote the firm’s announcement  that it is to create 12,000 jobs in the UK over the next five years.

Mr Cameron said: ‘Supporting business, creating jobs and cutting taxes are all part of our long-term economic plan.

‘Yesterday, our tax reforms cut income tax for 26million people and will help businesses to create jobs.

‘I am delighted that Asda is continuing to invest heavily in the UK, creating another 12,000 jobs that will give people financial security for the future.’
