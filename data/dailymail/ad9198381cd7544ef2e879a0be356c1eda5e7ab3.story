The U.S. will re-evaluate its role in the Middle East peace process with Secretary of State John Kerry saying it's 'reality check time.'

Mr Kerry, who is returning to Washington today, has lamented negative Israeli and Palestinian moves and has urged them to act to stop negotiations from collapsing.

He added that efforts on the Middle East peace process are not open-ended and that it has been regrettable that both sides have taken steps not helpful in promoting peace over the last few days.

U.S. Secretary of State John Kerry, pictured left during a trip to Algeria, says the Middle East peace process has reached 'reality check time'

The Secretary of State told AP that 
the United States would 'evaluate very carefully exactly where this is 
and where it might possibly be able to go.'

Today Palestinian protesters clashed with Israeli police near Ofer military prison in West Bank town of Betunia.

Masked men launched stones using slingshots and catapults with the Israelis responding with tear gas.

Yesterday,
 Mr Kerry was in Algeria for strategic security talks and has been in 
the Middle East twice in the past 10 days to help rescue the peace 
process.

And
 even though he vowed to continue his efforts towards peace but added 
there would be a limit to what the Obama administration can do.Â

He also said he could not force 
Israeli Prime Minister Benjamin Netanyahu or Palestinian President 
Mahmoud Abbas to continue peace talks, let alone resolve the 
long-running conflict.

He
 explained: 'You can facilitate, you can push, you can nudge, but the 
parties themselves have to make fundamental decisions and compromises.

'The leaders have to lead and they have to be able to see a moment when it's there.

It
 is thought Mr Kerry spoke with both leaders yesterday afternoon and 
that U.S. mediators continued talks with both Israeli and Palestinian 
negotiators in Jerusalem overnight.

The Secretary of State has spent much of the last two weeks working on the Middle East peace process.

Mr Kerry is returning to Washington today after strategic security talks in Algeria. He has been on a lengthy trip of Europe and the Middle East

While in Algeria yesterday, Mr Kerry met with Algerian Foreign Minister Ramtane Lamamra. They are pictured looking at the U.S.-Algeria Peace Treaty from 1795

He met with Mr Netanyahu in Israel on Monday and Mr Abbas last week in Jordan, but cancelled a third trip to the region on Wednesday after the Palestinians said they would seek greater United Nations recognition over Israeli objections.

Mr Abbas announced the move after Israel refused to release a group of Palestinian prisoners it had earlier agreed to free.

But despite eight months of talks, there have been few, if any, tangible signs of progress.

Mr Kerry said both the Israeli and Palestinian leaders have told him they remain committed to talks.
