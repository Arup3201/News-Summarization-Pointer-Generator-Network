The original calfskin Domesday Book has survived for over 900 years, considerably longer than a mirror project by the BBC launched in 1986 on laser discs.

The corporation’s aim was to celebrate the 900th anniversary of the book with a modern-day version using quotes, maps and videos - but the discs just didn’t take off and within 10 years the equipment that could read it was obsolete.

Now the whole project has been rebooted, with the Domesday Project loaded onto a computer with a 52in touch-screen that’s on display at The National Museum of Computing at Bletchley Park.

The book was commissioned in December 1085 by William the Conqueror. He had taken England by force in 1066 and wanted to know precisely what his spoils of war were.

The finished tome contained records of no less than 13,418 English settlements.

The BBC’s project in 1986 was welcomed by historians as like the original, it would provide a handy insight into life in 1986 - but market forces consigned it to history.

To view the discs you needed to put an Acorn BBC Master computer, an SCSI controller and a Philips VP415 Domesday laserdisc player on your shopping list.

None of this equipment endured the test of time, so the BBC set about finding alternative hardware to do the job.

Luckily, a joint U.S-UK project called CAMilEON (Creative Archiving at Michigan & Leeds: Emulating the Old on the New) saved the corporation’s blushes.

Researchers emulated a BBC Micro and the laser disc player and extracted the BBC’s data in a form that could be easily transferred to 2011 technology.

In April this year Domesday Reloaded was launched which saw extra information and observations about life in 2011 added to the original documents and loaded onto the touch-screen device.

Called the Domesday Touchtable, it contains 50GB of information and can be browsed by four different people at the same time.

Peter Armstrong was the team leader from the original project and contributed to Reloaded.

He told the BBC: ‘I think it's amazing. We're very very pleased. It's taken us a generation - 25 years later. A new generation of programmers made this happen.'

The exhibition at The National Museum of Computing Bletchley Park opened yesterday. Key data from the Domesday Book has been available online since 2004, while the original book is kept under lock and key at the The National Archives in Kew, London.
