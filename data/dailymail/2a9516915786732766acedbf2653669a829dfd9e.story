'Hen do from hell': Katherine Gillanders and Chelsea Montgomery attended the hen party in Essex

A hen party appalled by a foul stench at their seaside guest house discovered it was coming from a decomposing corpse in the room next door.

Friends of the bride-to-be told how she spent her hen night vomiting due to the 'disgusting' smell at Benson's Guest House in Southend-on-Sea in Essex on Friday.

The girls, who described flies buzzing around at the Victorian building, told how a cleaner discovered a man's body in the neighbouring room the following morning - and said it is thought he could have been lying there for days.

Chelsea Montgomery, 26, who attended the hen weekend in Essex, told The Sun newspaper: 'It was the hen do from hell.

'The bride threw up all night because of the smell.

'We spent the weekend spraying deodorant everywhere,' she said.

The guest house investigated after the girls complained about the smell spoiling their party, but because the room next door was let to a permanent tenant staff said they could not enter without permission.

It wasn't until the cleaner went in the following morning that the source of the stench was discovered, the girls said.

Ms Montgomery, who travelled from Windsor to the seaside resort with friend Katherine Gillanders to celebrate the hen's impending wedding, said they arrived after police had been called to the guest house.

The Victorian guest house, described on its website as a 'home-from-home' ideal for a holiday, business trip or short break at the beach, declined to comment when contacted by MailOnline today.

Body: The body of man in his 40s was discovered in the room next door to the one the girls were staying in at Benson's Guest House in Essex

A spokesman for Essex Police said: 'Police were contacted just after 10.30am on Saturday with reports of the sudden death of a man at a property in Hartington Road in Southend.

'Officers attended and found the body of a man believed to be in his 40s. The death is not being treated as suspicious and a file is being prepared for the coroner,' she added.
