It was a beautiful sunny morning for the Searle family as they sat by the pool in their Phuket hotel on Boxing Day in 2004.

Jillian Searle and her two boys, from Perth, WA, were oblivious to the horror  that was about to unfold as the devastating tsunami hit the popular Thai island.

Ms Searle recalls playing with Lachie, five, and Blake, two, as the first wave hit, before she was faced with a decision no mother should have to make - which of her two sons she should save.

She was getting young Blake and Lachie ready for a swim. Her husband had momentarily gone back to the room to get a spare pair of swimmers. 

'I remember hearing what sounded like jet planes so I looked up at the sky and didn't see anything so I thought that was quite weird,' she told Daily Mail Australia.

'At that point I also saw all these birds flying away and thought that was weird too.

There were more than 5,000 people killed in the tsunami that struck Thailand - 26 of which were Australian.

A decade on, commemorations have begun for the thousands of lives lost during the disaster.

The tsunami, triggered by a 9.1-magnitude earthquake, hit just off the west coast of Sumatra, Indonesia and struck coastal communities across the Indian Ocean.

It left about 230,000 people dead and caused about $10 billion in damage.

When the disaster struck Australia pledged $1 billion in humanitarian funds and played a key role helping with the overwhelming task of identifying thousands of victims.

'Then these two security guards ran past us and were on their walkie talkies which is when I looked up and saw this enormous amount of water coming towards us at a very fast pace.'

She grabbed her two-year-old and yelled at  Lachie to run for his life.

'I had Blake in my arm and grabbed Lachie's hand and I never looked back,' Ms Searle said.

'I remember getting into the hotel lobby, trying to get up on the breakfast bar but it was too full.

'I was yelling for help and then I saw this teenage girl, Elise, and she put out her hand which is when I let go of Lachie because I thought he would be okay with her.

'I knew we would all die if I didn't let go of one of the boys. I just wouldn't have had anything to fight the water.' 

That was the moment she let go of Lachie, hoping he would survive, as she got pulled under the water while she held onto Blake.

'At one point I thought I was underwater forever,' Ms Searle said.

'But every now and then when I got up above the water I could hear Blake screaming - so I knew he was still alive.'

Once she found safety, Ms Searle waded through the water in desperate search for Lachie.

'I saw Elise and I asked where he was and she said she had to let go because they were getting pulled out by the water again,' Ms Searle said.

'When she told me that I just screamed.' 

But there wasn't much time for Ms Searle to grieve as she was alerted of a second tsunami that was on its way.

'I could hear whistles blowing and people were yelling that the next wave was coming soon,' she said.

She was rushed to higher ground where she met her husband and told him the devastating news.

'I told my husband at the time that I'd lost Lachie,' Ms Searle said.

'Brad just took off and I didn't see him for awhile because he went looking for our son.' 

Once the worst had surpassed, everyone was taken up to the roof of the hotel where Ms Searle had to play the painful waiting game.

'When I finally saw Brad up on the roof he told me that he couldn't find Lachie and I just lost it,' she said.

'I was hysterical. Sobbing and screaming. I started to feel bad and there was so much guilt.

'I had all sorts of things going through my mind - like bringing back Lachie's body bag and packing up his bedroom back at home. I wasn't sure how I would get through his birthdays and the Christmases without him.'

For Lachie, who's now 15, the fear and the memories of his nightmare holiday still remain

An hour had passed and Lachie was still missing. Ms Searle was convinced she would never see her son again.

'I thought he was dead. Lachie couldn't swim,' she said. 

'So by that point everyone knew I'd lost Lachie but then someone said: "hey isn't that the Lachie who's been missing?".

'I opened my eyes and tried to wipe away my tears because everything was so blurry that I couldn't see. But then I saw a blue rashie - one that Lachie wore - and I just knew it was him.

'I just couldn't believe he was there, right in front of me.

'He didn't even have a scratch on him. He was perfect and was found by some security guards. And the first thing he said to me was "mummy I'm really dirty, I need a shower".

'I felt really lucky. It obviously wasn't our time and somebody was watching over us.

'Amazing - that's one word to describe it.'

Although Lachie, who's now 15, doesn't remember much of the day he remembers hanging onto a door for a couple of hours.

'I don't know how I survived but I guess when you're in survival mode and that strong mentality, you really don't know your own strengths,' he told Daily Mail Australia.

'I didn't even know what a tsunami was. I was only five. I just knew it was this big wave that wiped out everything.' 

In hindsight, Lachie says his mum made the right decision in letting him go.

'My brother was younger and had no chance of survival,' he said.

'I knew it had to be done and I think mum made a smart decision.'

While the Searles were the lucky few who lived to tell their tales of survival, there were more than 5,000 people killed in the tsunami that struck Thailand - 26 of which were Australian.

A decade on, commemorations have begun for the thousands of lives lost during the disaster.

The tsunami, triggered by a 9.1-magnitude earthquake, hit just off the west coast of Sumatra, Indonesia and struck coastal communities across the Indian Ocean. It left about 230,000 people dead.

But since the terrifying ordeal, Lachie and his family haven't been able to go back to Thailand.

'I think I'd like to go one day for a bit of closure but I just wouldn't put the boys through that at the moment,' Ms Searle said.

For Lachie, the fear and the memories of his nightmare holiday still remain. 

'Maybe I'll go when I'm a bit older but I wouldn't like to go now,' Lachie said.

Countries in the Indo-Pacific prepare to commemorate the 10th anniversary of the devastating Boxing Day tsunami in 2004 which left an estimated 230,000 people dead.

The main commemoration ceremonies are planned in Thailand and Indonesia where the worst death and destruction took place.

A series of ceremonies will be held in the country over the next three days to remember the victims. More than 4,000 people lost their lives at Khao Lak, north of Phuket, where many Germans and Scandinavians were holidaying. 

Thousands of Indonesians gathered in Banda Aceh, the capital of Aceh province on Sumatra, to hold a memorial service. Banda Aceh was largely flattened by the earthquake and subsequent waves and around 170,000 people died.

Indonesia bore the brunt of the disaster, with 130,736 people losing their lives. Sri Lanka suffered the second highest number of deaths with 35,322 people killed in the tragedy.

The tsunamis also devastated coastal communities in India, the Maldives, Myanmar (Burma), Malaysia, Somalia, Tanzania, Seychelles, Bangladesh and Kenya.

Coastal towns in India's Tamil Nadu state were devastated by the 2004 tsunami.
