Missing Irishman Donal 'Donie' O'Sullivan has been miraculously found alive, five days after he went missing on a street in broad daylight in Sydney, Australia.

A caretaker at an office tower around 100m from where O'Sullivan was last sighted found the 33-year-old naked and injured down a rarely used stairwell around 8.30pm on Wednesday.

Lapsing in and out of consciousness, Donie was able to give his mobile phone number and address back in Ireland before the man rushed next door to Easts Leagues Club to raise the alarm and call an ambulance.

Two hours later, his relieved brother, Johnnie O'Sullivan, learned Donie was alive, soon after he had returned home from a third night out scouring Sydney suburbs for the missing man.

More than a hundred young Irish nationals living in Sydney went out in pairs on Wednesday night, each assigned a search grid on a map drawn up by Donie's brother, a housemate and friends.

After spending several fruitless hours looking, Johnnie received a call telling him Donie had been admitted to St Vincents Hospital.

'He went straight there and Donie was able to talk,' a friend told the MailOnline. 'He recognised Johnnie.

'He's got head and back injuries, and he's very dehydrated, but he's now stable. He's quite stocky and that might have helped over five days without food.'

Johnnie O'Sullivan said he was 'very relieved' his brother has been found and was able to communicate with the person who found him.

Five day ordeal: Donie O'Sullivan was found in an office block stairwell as his brother and more than a hundred young Irish people were out on their third night of searching for him

Donie and Johnnie's sister and brother-in-law, Anna and Liam O'Hare, boarded a flight in Ireland on Wednesday and are due to land in Sydney tonight, when they are expected to go straight to St Vincents Hospital.

It is unclear how Donie came to stumble down the stairwell in Easts Tower. He had not taken his mobile phone with him for his night out last Friday at a party.

Donie, who is one of eight brothers and sisters from Clooney in Western Ireland, has been living in Australia since June 2012

He had returned from the all night party in Sydney's Eastern Suburbs on Saturday morning with one of his housemates and was looking for something to eat before returning to his home, just metres away.

CCTV footage showed him minutes earlier walking into the nearby Tea Gardens Hotel, buying a drink and sitting down.

Last sighting: After disappearing from the street near the Cock'n'Bull Bar (above) in Sydney's Bondi Junction, Donie O'Sullivan stumbled down a stairwell just metres from the bar and lay there injured for five days

Mystery: it is still unclear what happened to Donie O'Sullivan, 33, captured on CCTV (above) after having a drink in the Tea Gardens Hotel last Saturday morning and his discovery on Wednesday naked and injured in a nearby office block

He was last seen around 10.30am on Saturday on Bronte Road, Bondi Junction, walking in the direction of the Cock â€˜n Bull Bar on Ebley Street.

The bar is a short walk via a series of back lanes and a loading dock from the Easts Tower where Donie was found.

Last Sunday night, Donie's brother, and flatmates Amy Croffey and Jerry Calahane, were worried enough to report him missing to Waverley Police Station.

They said a woman police officer did not regard the case as serious and they had to return again to the station to speak with other officers a day later.

On Monday morning, Donie usually picked up his fellow workmates at around 4am to drive the two hours to the Australian capital, Canberra, where they spent the week working as pipe layers for Sydney company, KNF.

Donie didn't turn up, and the company vehicle he used for the drive was still parked outside his shared Bondi house.

On Monday night, Donie's flatmates met with other young Irish nationals to spread out over Sydney's Eastern and Inner City suburbs searching for him and putting up 'missing' posters with his photograph.

They renewed their search on Tuesday night and again on Wednesday before getting the news about Donie's discovery alive.

Police had stepped up their efforts to find Donie. Easts Leagues Club told the MailOnline police had approached them for clues, but that none of the club's CCTV footage was of use in the investigation.

Police say they are continuing their investigation as to how Donie sustained his injuries.
