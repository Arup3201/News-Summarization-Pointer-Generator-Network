Distraught relatives have made desperate pleas for a soldier who went missing last week to return but his cryptic last Facebook post suggests that he ran away purposefully.

Josh Warner kissed his wife goodbye early Wednesday morning when she thought he was headed to work at Fort Lewis in Spanaway, Washington but only knew something was wrong a few hours later.

'Trust me, Im doing everyone that knows me a favor. Good bye world,' Warner wrote on his Facebook page at 5.37am that morning.

Missing: Josh Warner, 38, worked as a mechanic for the 2nd Stryker Brigade at Fort Lewis in Washington and his fellow soldiers became concerned when he did not show up for physical training Wednesday morning

Family man: Warner has two sons, ages 5 and 6, and their mother has since told them that he was missing

The 38-year-old father-of-two works as a mechanic for the 2nd Stryker Brigade at Fort Lewis and his fellow soldiers realized there was a problem when he did not show up for that morning's physical training.

His wife Brandi Warner told local station KOMO that he has disappeared in the past but this is different.

'Not like this, not like this. Not for this long,' Mrs Warner said.

She hopes that he is 'out in the woods' and hasn't given up on the prospect of finding him.

History: Mrs Warner said that her husband has disappeared in the past but never for this long

'Just taking a break. Got overwhelmed with something, is just going to come back out of it, ya know? I hope,' she said.

Mrs Warner was alerted that there was a problem when officers the Pierce County Sheriff's Department came to her home for a welfare check, which came after he didn't show up for training.

Members of his brigade followed up and went to his home as well.

Mrs Warner said that she put off telling their sons- ages 5 and 6- that their dad was missing and not just at work for two days- waiting until the Friday of Memorial Day weekend to break the news.

She is now asking for the public's help in searching for her husband, who was last seen driving his brown pick up truck with Oregon license plates.
