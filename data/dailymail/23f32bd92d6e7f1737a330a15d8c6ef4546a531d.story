Rethink: Chanel will either have to rename the product or drop the caital 'J' in Jersey

Luxury fashion house Chanel has lost a legal battle to trademark the word 'Jersey' for its new perfume after officials in the Channel Islands campaigned against it.

The iconic French brand sought rights to the name because its founder Coco Chanel famously made clothes from jersey fabric.

But Island officials were concerned that using the region's name with a capital 'J' would lead buyers to believe the fragrance was produced locally.

The UK's intellectual property office's ruling means the name will be protected for Jersey farmers and small businesses.

Officials from the Economic Development 
Department were happy for Chanel to call its lavender scent 'Jersey' but wanted
 to safeguard the title for locals.

Senator Alan Maclean said: 'It was important that we challenged this. This was about ownership of the name Jersey.

'It is not about stopping Chanel using the name. It is fantastic to have a perfume named Jersey.'

Geographical trademarking has been a thorn in the side of many big businesses.

High-end fashion house Yves Saint 
Laurent was forced to destroy Â£10million of publicity material for its 
'Champagne' fragrance in 1993.

A
 court ruled that the name infringed upon the protected status of the 
famous wine that is produced in France's Champagne region.

According to the Intellectual Property Office, there are 13 applications in 
the UK asking for protected geographical status.

Protected: The use of a capital J in the perfume's name linked the product to the island

The makers of Yorkshire Wensleydale cheese, Scottish wild salmon, 
Lincolnshire sausages and traditional Bramley apple pie filling have requested geographical protection.

The Cornish pasty was awarded a 
protected status in 2011 which means that only Cornish pasties made in 
Cornwall and following the traditional recipe can legally be called 
â€˜Cornish pastiesâ€™.

Last month, a rare breed of Cumbrian sheep bred in the Lake District was awarded protected status.

There
 are now three registered abattoirs in Cumbria. If animals were born, 
reared and slaughtered at one of them, they can be classified as 
Lakeland Herdwick.

Coco Chanel started incorporating jersey fabric, a knitted woollen material originating in Jersey, into 
her designs in the 1920s.

She
 transformed what was previously seen as a utilitarian, mundane fabric 
ideally suited for rugged sailors' sweaters into something celebrated 
for its elegance.

Champagne: The name is reserved for wine producers in the French region. Yves Saint Laurent were forced to rename their perfume 'Yvresses' after the fashion house was banned from naming it 'Champagne'
