Stalinist: Ed Miliband's proposal has been compared to the land grab in Communist Russia

Developers would have their land seized if they fail to build on it, Ed Miliband said yesterday.

The Labour leader also unveiled plans to allow towns to expand into rural areas, riding roughshod over local objections.

His proposals were immediately condemned as a ‘Stalinist land grab’ and a threat to the countryside.

Mr Miliband warned of a housing crisis unless 200,000 homes were built a year – twice the current level, and one million over the life of the next parliament.

But in a move that critics warned would undermine property rights, he said town hall chiefs would get draconian new powers to fine developers who hoard land that has been granted planning permission – or even seize it altogether.

‘We’ll say to private developers, you can’t just sit on land and refuse to build,’ he told Labour delegates.

‘We will give them a very clear message – either use the land or lose the land – that is what the next Labour government will do.

‘We’ll say to local authorities that they have a right to grow, and neighbouring authorities can’t just stop them.

‘We’ll identify new towns and garden cities and we’ll have a clear aim that by the end of the parliament Britain will be building 200,000 homes a year, more than at any time in a generation.’

A senior aide said Labour would ‘give councils the power to charge developers escalating fees for sitting on land with planning permission to incentivise them to release the land... and if this doesn’t bite, they would be empowered to use compulsory purchase powers to release the land’.

The aide said towns such as Stevenage ‘need to expand’ but have been ‘blocked by neighbouring councils’.

Ovation: Delegates were on their feet at the Labour Party Conference, but new policies have been attacked

Graeme Leach, of the Institute of 
Directors, condemned the plans, comparing them to Joseph Stalin’s 
notorious seizure of land from prosperous Russians known as the Kulaks.

‘Mr Miliband’s “use it or lose it” declaration is a Stalinist attack on property rights,’ he said.

‘The fundamental problem with the housing market is the public sector planning system, not private sector builders.

'It’s hard to imagine a more statist solution to a problem caused by the state.’

Shaun Spiers, of the Campaign to Protect Rural England, backed moves to make developers build on brownfield sites with planning permission to prevent further development on greenfield land.

But he condemned the ‘right to grow’ as a threat to the countryside.

‘If they are really saying that regardless of environmental considerations and the wishes of local people, towns can expand in the face of objections from neighbouring authorities, that is going to get them in very hot water.

‘That will end up raising hackles and I don’t think they’re going to be able to deliver it.’ 

Tory chairman Grant Shapps pointed out that Labour has failed to meet previous pledges to build more homes.

He said: ‘The last Labour prime minister famously promised three million homes by 2020 and ten  eco-towns.

‘Instead the Labour government presided over a housing boom and bust which saw the house building industry brought to its knees.

‘Yet again, instead of supporting our policies which will help thousands of hardworking families take their first step on the ladder and backing planning reforms which are bringing through much needed planning permissions, Ed Miliband is offering only more empty promises based on more borrowing and more debt.’

In 2007, Mr Miliband’s predecessor Gordon Brown set a target of building 240,000 new homes a year by 2016.

He said he would make house-building a ‘national priority’, as it was in the inter-war years and the 1950s.

He set an overall target of three million new homes by 2020.

At the time, Tory leader David Cameron accused Mr Brown of recycling old policies, saying that he had made  similar promises on four occasions since 1994.

But for every year before 2007, Labour had built fewer social houses than when the Conservatives were in office.

Mr Brown had promised to speed up the planning process and to bring surplus public land into housing use.

Sodom and Gomorrah: Mr Blunkett has compared atmosphere to 1930s Berlin

Online porn should be blocked automatically to protect society from ‘bestial activities’, according to David Blunkett.

The former Home Secretary supported the opt-in system backed by the Daily Mail.

Under this, internet pornography would be blocked unless customers ask their internet service providers to lift the controls.

Speaking at an event run by the think-tank Demos, Mr Blunkett said: ‘I think we have a job in this country, in a civilised, free, open democracy,  to protect ourselves from the most bestial activities and from dangers that would undermine a civilised nation.’

Mr Blunkett also likened today’s lax moral climate to the atmosphere in Germany under which the Nazis flourished.

‘In the late 1920s and early 1930s, Berlin came as near as dammit to Sodom and Gomorrah,’ he said.

‘There was a disintegration of what you might call any kind of social order.’

Helen Goodman, Labour’s media spokesman, stressed that the internet should be regulated.

She said it ‘should not be like the forest in the 13th century’ where bandits operated ‘outside the law’.

‘That was not a sustainable position then and it’s not a sustainable position now,’ she added.
