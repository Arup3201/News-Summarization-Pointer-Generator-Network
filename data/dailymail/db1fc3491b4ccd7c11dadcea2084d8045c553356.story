A young dog that was branded with a swear-word by cruel thugs who used chemicals to burn away her fur and skin is on the road to recovery after undergoing plastic surgery.

Felicity, a six month old pitbull mix, was discovered in a sorry state tied to a fence in Lexington, Kentucky last month, suffering from severe burns.

Authorities believe her torturers had used a caustic agent or bleach to burn her before simply abandoning her.

Lexington Humane Society officials said they have found her a home but wanted to do surgery to try to hide the four-letter word.

Hundreds of wellwishers donated cash to pay for the operation.

Thankfully the surgery, which was performed last week by staff veterinarian Liz Ubelhor, was a complete success.

Lexington Animal Control has received several tips about who may have hurt Felicity but none have so far led to an arrest.

The Lexington Humane Society is now offering a $3,500 reward for information on the person responsible.

Society development manager Ashley Hammond told WKYT: 'I don't think emotionally she's going to have any problems. She seems to be pretty forgiving.'
