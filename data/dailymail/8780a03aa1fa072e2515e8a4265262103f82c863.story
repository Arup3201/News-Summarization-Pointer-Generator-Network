It has always been said that Britain is a nation of animal lovers.

And research seems to back that up, with many of us showing more empathy for a battered dog than a battered human.

We are, it seems, moved the most by the suffering of puppies and children. A study has found that while they were the most emotive subjects, dogs elicited more empathy than abused humans.

Emotions: A study found that many of us show more empathy for a battered dog than a battered human

Researchers say this is down to a perception of vulnerability.

Professor Jack Levin and Professor 
Arnold Arluke, from Northeastern University in Boston, Massachusetts, 
examined the opinions of 240 people who received one of four fictional 
news articles.

One concerned the beating of a 
one-year-old child and a second an adult in his 30s. The other two were 
about a puppy or a six-year-old dog being abused.

The difference in empathy between 
child and puppy was ‘statistically non-significant’. But the dog 
garnered more feeling than the adult.

How humans react: We are, it seems, moved the most by the suffering of puppies and children

Professor Levin told the annual 
meeting of the American Sociological Association: ‘The fact adult human 
crime victims receive less empathy than do child, puppy, and full-grown 
dog victims suggests adult dogs are regarded as dependent and vulnerable
not unlike their younger canine counterparts and kids.

‘In addition, it appears that adult 
humans are viewed as capable of protecting themselves while full-grown 
dogs are just seen as larger puppies.’

Professor Levin reckoned findings 
would be similar for cats. He said: ‘These are animals to which many 
individuals attribute human characteristics.’
