It then turns over on its side.

Suvorov is forced to swerve out of the way to avoid a collision.

The pair's respective Facebook pages identify them as friends who both attended Sayreville War Memorial High School. 

Suvorov offered his video to the prosecutor's office but sent it to NJ Advance Media before authorities saw it.
