A nature photographer has captured breath-taking photos of frozen trees in a remote part of Western Russia where the temperature drops to a chilling -35C.

Set against the red and orange glow of the sky, the trees carve eerie shapes on the frigid landscape as they buckle under the weight of ice and snow.

They make for unworldly figures as they stand against a magnificent, wintry backdrop in Perm Krai and Sverdlovsk Oblast.

Photographer Sergey Makurin captured the stunning shots while trekking through the Ural mountain range in Western Russia

Mr Makurin said 'it's not always easy to get the perfect shot' it sometimes too him hours or even days to get it right

The stunning shots were captured by Russian photographer Sergey Makurin in the Ural Mountains, which extend south from the coast of the Arctic Ocean.

Sergey trekked through sub-zero weather to access an area which is extremely isolated with very few human inhabitants for miles around.

Some of his images show clusters of bent trees, which make it seem like a single tree has been sliced in half. 

Sergey Makurin decided to photograph the Ural Mountains at winter to 'share this incredible region with the rest of the world'

Photographer Sergey Makurin says the area has so much natural beauty that it can be comforting being miles away from the nearest human

Sergey Makurin describes the trees as 'eerie' and says it can be 'a little unnerving' being in such an isolated area

Sergey, 45, said: ‘When I was 12 years old I got to see the Ural Mountains for the first time and I was amazed.

‘I felt I had to share this incredible region with the rest of the world.

‘The trees do look eerie and knowing that you are in a very isolated area can sometimes be a little unnerving.’

 It may look like a scene from the magical world of Narnia, but these photos were snapped in a remote part of Western Russia

 Sergey Makurin says he's at his best when he's photographing natural beauty spots like the frozen trees in the Urals

Mr Makurin became fascinated with the winter wonderland after seeing the Ural Mountains for the first time when he was 12 years old

He added: ‘During the winter months the area has so much natural beauty and it can be a comforting thought that you are so far away from anything.

‘It's not always easy to get the perfect shot, and sometimes it takes me hours or even days to get it right.

‘But the shooting process carries me away from everything and I feel at my best when I'm taking pictures of breath-taking natural beauty like the one found in Ural.’
