A neo-classical masterpiece, Thomas Jefferson's Monticello estate is one of the most revered pieces of architecture in the United States.

And now there are two.

Replicating the 1772 plantation brick-for-brick, a designer has painstakingly created his own version.

He even used identical materials.

Take two: This is a brick-for-brick replica in Somers, Connecticut, of Thomas Jefferson's neoclassical Monticello plantation

Original: Jefferson started work on the Charlottesville, Virginia, residence in 1772 when he was just 26 years old after inheriting land

Work of art: Throughout his presidency, Jefferson adapted the property to feature different trends of 18th century Europe

S Prestley Blake, co-founder of Friendly's ice cream parlor and an amateur architect, undertook the project as his 'swan song' in the run-up to his 100th birthday.

Construction began on the Somers, Connecticut, replica in the summer of 2013 after Blake purchased the ten-acre property, which connects to his own 80-acre property by a wooded horse trail.

He tore down the church and home that existed on the land, which had been owned by Big Y supermarket co-founder Gerald D'Amour.

He then decided to use the property to build a reproduction of the Charlottesville, Virginia, home he has referred to as 'the country's most architecturally beautiful residence.'

Adapted: He allowed for more modern interiors to be installed in the 10,000-square-foot home which is now on the market

Tribute: Homages exist throughout including the blue sky ceiling mural in the hall that recalls the skylight in Jefferson’s dome room

Inspired:  Jefferson's design was inspired by Italian Renaissance architect Andrea Palladio and he adapted it throughout his life

And now, it is on sale for $6,500,000 with William Pitt Sotheby's. 

Jefferson, America's third president, started building Monticello - which means 'little mount' in Italian - when he was 26 years old after inheriting the land from his father. 

Slaves worked the 5,000 acres of land farming tobacco and other crops. 

Vast: This is one of the 11 rooms in the home, which also boasts acres of land, which would have been farmed on in Jefferson's day

Historic: Despite relaxing his rules, Blake still wanted to give the interior a historic feel with oak-paneled walls and chandeliers

Idyllic views: Like the third president, would-be buyers will be treated to views of sprawling countryside out of floor-to-ceiling windows

His design was inspired by Italian Renaissance architect Andrea Palladio, widely considered the most influential individual in the history of Western architecture.

Throughout his presidency, he adapted the property to feature different trends of 18th century Europe.

Jefferson was buried on the grounds, which is now owned by the Thomas Jefferson Foundation. 

Live like a ruler: The domed ceiling stands over two sweeping staircases reminiscent of architecture in the deep south

Domesticated: The property, though a novelty, is fully equipped with kitchen appliances for the new owners to enjoy

Grandeur: Guests will be able to enjoy breakfast atop this vast marble breakfast bar in the extended kitchen area

Winding: The 10-acre property connects to Blake's own 80-acre residence by a wooded horse trail

With nearly 10,000 square feet of living space, the replica has a total of 11 rooms with five bedrooms and five bathrooms and four en suites.

The replication did not extend to the interior, which was built to accommodate a more modern lifestyle.

However, homages exist throughout including the blue sky ceiling mural in the entryway that recalls the skylight in Jefferson's dome room.

Revered: The property appears on five-cent coins and is widely recognized as the most beautiful building in America
