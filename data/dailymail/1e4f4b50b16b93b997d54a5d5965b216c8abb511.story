Calum Best is embarking upon a hair overhaul: the model and actor has shaved off his enormous bushy beard as he prepares to undergo his third hair transplant in just two years.

The 33-year-old star - son of the late footballing legend George Best - is clean shaven again after finally ditching his hipster beard, which took him six months to grow to its full length. 

The model had followed the lead of stars such as David Beckham, George Clooney, Bradley Cooper and Ben Affleck, who all made beards fashionable again in the last year.

Before and after: Calum tired of the daily maintenance involved in maintaining the beard, which he nicknamed 'Gandalf', so decided to shave it off and now he's about to undergo a hair transplant

But Calum tired of the daily maintenance involved in maintaining the beard, which he nicknamed 'Gandalf' after the Lord of the Rings wizard played by Ian McKellen. 

Calum said: 'It turns into a daily grind making sure it is ship shape. It needs a lot more maintenance than your head hair and you have the added complication of keeping it clean. I feel ten years younger without it.'

Calum grew the beard earlier this year for his lead role in the movie Countryman. He also featured as a heavily bearded executive in an advert for Rolls Royce in Dubai.

He soon found that being hirsute helped him to find work as a model and actor. He explained: 'I was originally going to shave it off after the film but I found it was definitely good for business. A beard of that length gives you a whole different look and gives you a unique selling point.' 

'Losing that beard has taken a decade off me,' he said. 'There is no doubt a beard ages you. People associate them with middle-aged men.' 

Party-loving Calum admitted that the reaction from women had been mixed. 'Some love that whole caveman thing and can't get enough it,' he explained. 'But there is no doubt many others find it a turn-off and don't fancy kissing a guy with a bush on his chin.' 

Calum also ditched his beard for practical reasons because next month he is undergoing his third £6,000 hair transplant. 

The star has already had two procedures after first  losing his hair in his early 20s. He believes he damaged his hair follicles by pulling it back in a tight ponytail.

His best asset: Calum found that being hirsute helped him to find work as a model and actor. 'I was originally going to shave it off after the film but I found it was definitely good for business. A beard of that length gives you a whole different look and gives you a unique selling point', he said 

He also thinks he hastened his hair loss by over-bleaching. He refused to take the clinically proven drug Propecia, which would have halted his hair loss, because it affects the sex drive of 2 per cent of patients.

'It may only be two guys in a 100 but I didn't want to take the risk,' he laughed. 

Calum, from Fulham, London, is having 3,000 hairs transplanted from the side to the front of his hairline which is still receding, particularly at the temples. 

He said: 'All the transplanted hair is permanent - the problem I have is that I am still losing my natural hair.'

'These procedures have completely changed my life. They have given me so much more confidence and enabled me to wear my hair just the way I like. The fact that I still have my hair helps me to get film roles.' 

Ageless: Calum says he feels ten years younger without his shaggy beard. 'There is no doubt a beard ages you. People associate them with middle-aged men,' he said

Dr Shahmalak of the Crown Clinic in Manchester, who has performed hair transplants on a string of celebrities and will be doing Calum's for the third time, said: 'If you make your living in the public eye, you need to look good. 

'How many movie heart-throbs are there who are bald? Lots of men need more than one transplant, particularly if they prefer not to take Propecia. 

'Like Calum, Wayne Rooney has also had two hair transplants. I suspect Wayne will also need a third procedure because his natural hair is still thinning.'
