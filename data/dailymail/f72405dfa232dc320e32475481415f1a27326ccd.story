These luxurious calf leather handbags with beautiful silk detailing are helping women in Pakistan out of poverty.

The Popinjay brand uses local artisans in rural Pakistan and offers fair wages, which allows them to become self-sufficient and provide for their families.

The company is the brainchild of American-educated engineer Saba Gul.

Saba Gal, who set up the company in 2011, with two of the workers

Saba, who is from Pakistan herself, says she felt heartbroken at the lack of opportunities for women in her home country but it was hearing the story of a 12-year-old Afghan girl called Azaada Khan that inspired her to take action.

Azaada
 pretended to be a boy for in order to be allowed to attend 
school during a time when girls had not rights to an education.

This story inspired Saba to create a programme that could provide a livelihood and skills for young women in a similar predicament in Pakistan.

The Pakistani women who create the handbags, one such worker pictured above, were once living in poverty

So in 2011, Saba left a successful career as an engineer in America and moved to Pakistan.

In the summer of 2011 she launched the company's first handmade products under the 
label BLISS, which was re-launched as Popinjay in the autumn of 2013.

Popinjay's mission is to provide fair-wage jobs for women when they leave school.

The pilot programme originally began as a non-profit scheme, which Saba funded with her own savings and money raised through an Indiegogo campaign.

The women who make the handbags (pictured in the mustard fields

However, running a non-profit programme came with unforeseen complications for someone with a start-up mentality.

Saba explains: 'I heavily underestimated the frustrations of raising non-profit money. As a non-profit, BLISS was unable to convince top-tier professionals to join because equity couldn't be part of the package.'

In January 2013, Saba rebranded BLISS as Popinjay, and started running it as a commercial business. The company moved from Attock to Hafizabad, which has high levels of female unemployment.

Saba decided to focus on high-end handbag designs, which involved retraining the artisans and replacing cotton with fine leather and silks.

The collection now includes 100 per cent calfskin leather totes, which sell for $420 (£260), and clutch bags with embroidered silk detailing for $185 (£114).

The beautifully handcrafted bags can be bought online (but expect to pay $25/£15 for shipping to the UK) and are also available in boutiques across the US.

The company now employs 150 women who earn $2.50-$3 (£1.50 - £1.85) per hour, which is two to three times what they were making at BLISS and approximately five times the national average in the garment trade.For more information: http://www.popinjay.co/
