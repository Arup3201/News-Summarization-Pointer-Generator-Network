When police officer Derek Pratico was called out to a burglary, he couldn't help but feel the victim's heartache.

The mother was devastated that thieves had stolen her three-year-old son's birthday present from the car - and she had no money to replace it.

Officer Pratico was so touched by her plight that he went beyond the call of duty to buy the boy a birthday present, cake and a card with his own money.

'Amazing heart': Police officer Derek Pratico presents a three-year-old boy with a birthday present, cake and card which he paid for with his own money after burglars took the ones his mother had bought him

He also paid for a $100 gift card to help the unnamed mother and son replace some of the other items stolen in the raid.

When Jacksonville Sheriff's Office learned of their officer's generosity, they were keen to tell the world.

In a message on its Facebook page, the force said: 'We just heard about it and thought everyone needed to know what an amazing heart Officer Pratico has.

Modest: Officer Practico insisted he didn't do it for the publicity, but that it was the 'right thing to do'

'Great job, Officer Pratico! We are so proud of you.

'Thank you for making a positive impact on this Jacksonville family.'

Officer Practico agreed to have a picture of him presenting the boy with his gifts posted on the site, but insisted he didn't do it for the publicity.

He said: 'I did not do this for any recognition. I just felt it was the right thing to do at that moment.'
