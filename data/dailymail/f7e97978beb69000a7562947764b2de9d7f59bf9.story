Horrific: A sickening game based on the Boston Marathon terror attack which shows runners dead and injured in the street has been developed

Horrific images from the game show cartoon scenes of people cheering on the streets while runners lie injured or dead on the ground.

In one image, an injured man can be seen in a wheelchair with part of his leg missing. 

According to Buzzfeed, the game has been created by members of the notorious 'Lolokaust' group of trolls.

The deadly twin bombing at the marathon finish line on April 15 left three people dead and more than 200 others injured.

Martin Richard, 8, Krystle Campbell, 29, and Lu Lingzi, 23  were killed in the attack.

In recent years, other sickening games have emerged on the internet, including Kindergarten Killer and Ethnic Cleansing.

Brothers Dzhokhar and Tamerlan Tsarnaev are alleged to be behind the bomb attack.

Tamerlan was killed in a shootout with police officers.

His brother Dzhokhar was found by police officers hiding in a boat on Friday morning following a huge manhunt across the city.

His condition has been upgraded from 'serious' to 'fair,' as he recovers from wounds he sustained during a firefight with authorities.

Dzhokhar
 has reportedly confessed that he and his brother Tamerlan planted the 
pressure cooker bombs, and were driven to commit the attack by the wars 
in Iraq and Afghanistan.

Tamerlan Tsarnaev was an ardent reader of jihadist websites and extremist propaganda, including Inspire magazine, an online publication produced by al Qaeda's Yemen affiliate.

The English-language magazine is dedicated to spreading al Qaeda's message, and even includes instructions on how to construct explosive devices.
