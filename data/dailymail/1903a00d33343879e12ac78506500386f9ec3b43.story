No matter how small your house or flat is, chances are there are corners of rooms where you struggle to get a Wi-Fi signal.

The eero system has been designed to banish these so-called Wi-Fi ‘dead zones’ by boosting a router’s signal inside, and outside, a house.

A square eero box measures 4.75 inches (121mm), meaning it can be placed discreetly around a house, and it regularly runs checks on the network to avoid crashes and interference.

The eero system has been designed to banish so-called Wi-Fi ‘dead zones’ by boosting a router’s signal inside, and outside, a house. The square eero boxes measure 4.75 inches (121mm) and can be placed around the home to create what’s known as a ‘mesh network’ to boost Wi-Fi signal

Eero is based in San Francisco and was founded by Nick Weaver, Nate Hardison and Amos Schallich.

It creates what’s known as a mesh network.

Mesh networks are typically used by businesses because they transfer data in ‘multiple hops’. By comparison, a traditional router and extender only lets data make a single hop.

Width: 4.75 inches (121mm)

Depth: 4.75 inches (121mm)

Height: 0.85 inch-1.26 inch (22-33mm)

Processor: 1.0GHz dual-core

Apps: iOS, Android and web browser

Price: Individual boxes cost $125 (£85), a pack of three eero boxes costs $299 (£196)

Release date: Summer 2015

By sending data in multiple hops, it minimises how much signal is lost.

Signal is also lost as it travels through walls, and can suffer from interference from home electronics and a neighbour’s Wi-Fi, for example.

‘Eero is the world’s first Wi-Fi system,’ explained the firm.

‘[Eeros] work in unison to deliver hyper-fast, super-stable Wi-Fi to every nook of every room. 

'And from your backyard, too.’

It boosts the signal by using multiple paths to transfer data.

For example, if a door closes or a cordless phone causes interference, eero routes around it by taking an alternate path or by using a different frequency band.

Eero is based in San Francisco and was founded by Nick Weaver, Nate Hardison and Amos Schallich. Wi-Fi signal degrades as it travels through walls, and it can suffer from interference from home electronics and a neighbour’s Wi-Fi, for example. A box is pictured on a typical desk

It regularly runs checkups on the network and scans for devices that are connected to a network, including the speeds each device is achieving throughout the home, and any interference.

And from a security point of view, eero alerts users whenever a device joins a network and will send a weekly report of all devices that have used the network.

A pack of three eero boxes can be pre-ordered for $299 (£196), while an individual box costs $125 (£85) - although eero said a network can contain up to 10 boxes, for larger houses.

Devices are expected to ship this summer, and will initially only be available in the US and Canada. Shipping will add $10 (£6) to each order. 

The company has not announced when the devices will go on sale in other regions.
