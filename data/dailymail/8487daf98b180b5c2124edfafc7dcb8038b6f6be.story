Nazi plans to build a bridge linking the Crimean region of Ukraine to Russia look set to be revived after Russian Prime Minister Dmitry Medvedev created a company to take on the project.

The proposed bridge would span the the Strait of Kerch between the Chushka Spit in Russia and the Kerch Peninsula in Ukraine, giving Russia one of only three major entrance points to the strategic Crimean peninsula - the others being the M17 and M18 motorways from mainland Ukraine.

The idea for a bridge linking the countries was originally conceived by German architect Albert Speer during the Second World War in the hope it would aid the German invasion of the North Caucasus.

Medvedev said plans signed by Russia and Ukraine in 2010 to build the bridge are still binding, despite increased tensions between the countries following Russia's decision to send troops into the Crimean region following the ousting of Ukrainian president Viktor Yanukovych last week.

Russia has refused to recognise the new 'unconstitutional' government in Kiev which, it said, is run by militants and ultra-nationalists.

It claims to have entered Crimea in order to protect Russian-speakers who make up the majority of the population in the southern and regions of Ukraine.

During a meeting with his deputies on Monday, Medvedev demanded practical work on the bridge begin immediately, saying: 'Ukraine has always been and will remain an important trade and economic partner to us, and the government should work on these issues.

'We are following the developments closely,' he added.

Idea: Adolf Hitler personally commissioned a three-mile rail and road bridge based on Speer's plans (pictured) in 1943 in the hope it would help him conquer the Soviet Union

Plans: The proposed bridge would link the Crimean peninsula to the Russian region of Krasondar Krai

The Kerch Strait Bridge has a long history, little of which Medvedev will want to be associated with.Â 

Adolf Hitler personally commissioned a three-mile rail and road bridge based on Speer's plans in 1943 in the hope it would help him conquer the Soviet Union.

The iron and concrete structure was to replace a rope bridge that had been built to support the retreat the German Organisation Todt the previous year.

Speer was given just six months to build the new bridge, and in his memoirs raised doubts over how realistic the project was given how quickly the Soviet army were approaching.

'Even at that time it was clear that the bridge would never be completed,' Speer wrote.

As Soviet troops began their push towards Berlin later in 1943, the retreating German army left behind an incomplete 2.8 mile stretch of bridge that began to crumble within two years.

By the 1960s the remains of the Nazi bridge, much of which was now under the sea, became so dangerous to passing ships that they were cleared completely.

Since the Second World War, various projects to span the strait have been proposed or attempted.

The idea of a Kerch Strait bridge 
once again resurfaced after the collapse of the Soviet Union in 1991, but in 1994 the 
Russian and Ukrainian sides failed to finalise the project and it appeared to have finally been scrapped.

In 2010, however, Ukrainian President Viktor Yanukovych and 
Russian President Dmitry Medvedev signed a new agreement to build a bridge 
across the Kerch Strait.

In late January this year, the Ukrainian and Russian governments decided that a new pan-national company would be commissioned to handle the construction of the bridge, while the Russian state enterprise Russian Highways would become responsible for it long term.

Medvedev's signing of a decree on Monday stated his intention to see the project through, despite the Ukrainian government being ousted, and increasing tensions between the countries.
