Bradford forward Chev Walker admits the relegation-threatened Bulls have hit 'rock bottom' but sends out a note of defiance ahead of their game against Hull KR at the Provident Stadium on Friday night.

Captain Matt Diskin takes charge of his first match as caretaker coach following the sacking of head coach Francis Cummins and assistant Lee St Hilaire in the wake of Sunday's demoralising 46-18 defeat at Salford.

It was the latest twist in a season of woe for the Bulls which began with the deduction of six points for going into administration and leaves them with the unlikely task of needing to win at least five of their last 11 matches to preserve their First Utility Super League status.

'Sadly we are used to things going against us but we're not rolling over and calling it quits,' Walker said. 'Obviously confidence is shot at the minute.

'Disko has put his hand up and his first day as coach was good. We had a good session and he delivered his messages and his game plan over to us really well.

'Credit to Disko for doing that. Obviously Lee and Franny were a big part of our group and held us together for so long so it's sad, but as a group we owe it to them and to ourselves to try and get some performances.

'We are trying to gain something to give us that little bit of confidence to move forward.'

Cummins paid the price for the below-par performances of his players and the 31-year-old Walker, who had a two-year spell at Hull KR from 2008-09, acknowledged he endured an off day at Salford, which was a sad way to mark his 300th career appearance.

'There is no point looking at the table, we know where we're at,' Walker said. 'We're all striving to be that bit better in what we're doing.

'I know at the weekend I was second guessing over things that I'd normally take for granted. I don't know if it was pressure, it just seemed to be one of them where we fall in a heap. It seems to come down to a lack of trust in your own ability and the situation that we're in.'

If Bradford are to pull off 'mission impossible', a win over a weakened Rovers is essential and Walker sees the visit of his old club as a potential life-saver.

'It's a winnable game but we've not been helping ourselves at times,' he said. 'Our backs are completely against the wall now, we are at rock bottom, so we definitely need to come out fighting.

'Regardless of the result, we need to get some confidence back, and hopefully off the back of that the performances and wins will come.

'Hull KR are in a similar boat to ourselves. They've got a decent enough squad to be able to play well but they are a bit hit and miss. It should be a good battle between two teams looking for a bit of momentum.'

Rovers have slipped out of the top eight after conceding 88 points in their last two matches, and former Bradford favourite Jamie Langley joined fellow forwards Justin Poore, Kevin Larroyer and Jordan Cox on the sidelines with a season-ending knee injury sustained in last Friday's home defeat by Warrington.

The Robins beat the Bulls 16-0 at home in March but coach Craig Sandercock, who is in talks over a new contract, admits the change of coach makes Bradford dangerous opponents.

'I am disappointed for Francis as a coach but when teams change coaches there always seems to be one or two weeks where they really up the ante,' Sandercock said.

'On paper they have a good squad and at their home ground they are always tough to play against so we are under no illusions.'
