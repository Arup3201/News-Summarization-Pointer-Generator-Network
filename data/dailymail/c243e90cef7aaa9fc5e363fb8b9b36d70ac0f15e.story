Derek Passmore smashed the skull of his disabled victim. Police have been searching for the 49-year-old, who beat Paul Craig to death in a  jealous rage, since last June

At least three killers are on the run after absconding from open prison, including a murderer who smashed his disabled victim’s head in.

One of the men has been at large for nine years, it emerged last night.

MPs said the public were being put at risk by the policy of allowing dangerous life-sentence prisoners to go on day release.

The revelations came as police 
continue to hunt for Michael Wheatley, the serial armed robber known as 
the ‘Skull Cracker’, who disappeared from his open prison in Kent on 
Saturday.

The thug – who was serving 13 life sentences for a string of raids on banks and building societies – was spotted in the Strawberry Hill area of Twickenham, South-West London, on Monday night.

A member of the public dialled 999 and said Wheatley had been seen in several pubs and a ‘club’, which is believed to be a snooker hall.

But police failed to apprehend him and fear the fugitive could try to travel to Ireland, Cheshire or North Wales where he has friends, including other former prisoners.

At Westminster, Justice Secretary Chris Grayling came under pressure to explain why Wheatley – who battered his victims with an imitation pistol – had been moved to open conditions.

The case also threw the spotlight on other hardened convicts who had absconded. Officials admitted that police were hunting three other  killers, including two murderers and a man guilty of manslaughter.

Chillingly, one of the murderers – Derek Passmore – smashed the skull of his disabled victim. Police have been searching for the 49-year-old, who beat Paul Craig to death in a  jealous rage, since last June.

At his sentencing in 1997, the court heard Passmore battered his victim’s skull after ‘erroneously’ thinking Mr Craig was seeing his estranged girlfriend. Mr Craig, who was crippled with arthritis, was left dying in a flat in Hampton, Middlesex.

Passmore was sentenced to a minimum of 11 years behind bars and had been moved to HMP Ford, in Sussex, to prepare him for release when he fled while on day release.

The other murderer, 53-year-old David Richards, absconded in 2005 and has still not been found. Since 2004/05, a total of 106  murderers have walked free after being allowed to serve their sentence in an open prison. The  figure was revealed in a Parliamentary answer to backbench Tory MP Philip Davies.

The revelations came as police continue to hunt for Michael Wheatley (pictured here in a police handout in 2002), the serial armed robber known as the 'Skull Cracker', who disappeared from his open prison in Kent on Saturday

Last night, he told the Mail: ‘The public will be horrified that people like this are in open  prisons in the first place and  that they can just walk out of  the gates.

‘These instances show that it is not a theoretical risk that  dangerous prisoners will abscond – it is a practical risk. The Michael Wheatley case is not a one-off. The public is being put unnecessarily at risk.’

He added: ‘There are 640 people serving life sentences in open prisons. We can’t allow the public to be put at risk in this way.

‘We need an urgent review of who is being put in open prison, and action taken to stop murderers and rapists from being put there in the first place.

‘Open prisons should be for people like [tax evader] Lester Piggott, not murderers and  rapists.’ Mr Grayling admitted there had been ‘too many’ absconds from open jails, with one inmate going on the run every two days. Between May 2010 and April 2013, more than 580 prisoners absconded. Eighteen are still at large.

Wheatley was serving 13 life sentences for a string of raids on banks and building societies, and was spotted in the Strawberry Hill area of Twickenham, South-West London, on Monday night

Asked why Wheatley was in open jail in the first place, Mr Grayling said: ‘I want to know that as well and I am carrying out an inquiry into the individual circumstances of the case.’

He told Sky News: ‘I have not been happy with the system we have had in place. We have had a number of incidents over the past few months’.

Mr Grayling said he was changing the rules so offenders would have to wear a tag when they were on day release, but admitted he did not yet have the ‘technology’. Officials say the system may not be up and running until the autumn.

Mr Grayling said that, if and when he was caught, Wheatley would be put back in closed  conditions and would be made to spend a ‘considerable time longer’ behind bars.

Other killers who have gone on the run over the past year include Paul Flint, a convicted murderer and burglar who walked out  of Ford.

Sussex Police said they believed he may be linked to two burglaries while he was at large.

He was recaptured last  September after being on the loose for four months.

 Justice Minister Jeremy Wright said: ‘We take all absconds very seriously. Under this Government, absconds have fallen to historically low levels – down by 84 per cent in the past ten years.

‘We rigorously risk-assess all those placed in open prison  to ensure they are suitable for those conditions.

‘The rules have also been toughened up so prisoners will only be allowed out on day release for a specific purpose, such as gaining work experience.’
