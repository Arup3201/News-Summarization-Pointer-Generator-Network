Manchester City have an interest in England midfielder Ross Barkley, as do all of the Premier League's top clubs, but they have yet to set wheels in motion for any bid.

Any such action would likely depend on Yaya Toure and what comes of his planned talks with City's hierarchy.

It is understood he and his representative Dimitri Seluk have made contact with the club owners to dampen the initial furore that surrounded his claims of feeling unloved.

Wanted man: Ross Barkley is attracting interest from Manchester City

Young star: Barkley had a good World Cup for England - despite being knocked out early

On his way? Yaya Toure could leave City this summer

City are relatively relaxed as the 31-year-old is on a lucrative four year contract but there is an unease that the problem could arise again.

Paris Saint-Germain have made no secret of their interest should Toure be made available while reports in France have linked Manchester United, Chelsea and Real Madrid.

City hope to maintain control of the situation while the sale of such a talent would sorely test any buying club's Financial Fair Play guidelines.

Should the worst happen and Toure goes then Barkley would come into their thinking but he would not be their only option.

Suffice to say Everton have no plans to sell Barkley. After last season's step forward, it would be a huge fall backwards to sell the 20-year-old.

The statement it sends out would undermine what the club is striving to achieve.

They know they could command £50million plus but Barkley is pivotal to the plans of Roberto Martinez. If those plans come to fruition that should convince Barkley his immediate future is at Goodison.

Correa could see Atletico move collapse due to heart problem

Atletico Madrid beat Manchester City to the signing of Angel Correa, who was hailed as Argentina's latest wunderkind.

However, during the 19-year-old's medical in May, it was discovered that the San Lorenzo teenager had a heart defect and he was sent for surgery at a New York clinic.

The latest prognosis is that he must avoid all football for another six months to allow his body time to repair and re-adjust.

The clubs have now decided to suspend the transfer and will monitor his recuperation with Atletico poised to make a statement in the coming weeks.

Correa, who hails from the same city as Lionel Messi, Rosario, only made his full debut last year and had agreed a five year contract with the clubs agreeing a £6m transfer fee.

Liverpool keen on PSV's Bakkali

Liverpool admire Zakaria Bakkali at PSV Eindhoven but are unlikely to make a bid at this stage. The 18-year-old has been watched closely by Arsenal and Tottenham this season while Valencia have an interest too.

Liverpool are continuing talks with Stoke over the permanent sale of Oussama Assaidi for £4.5m, rising to £7m, while Sunderland are trying to find money to pay for Fabio Borini.

Liverpool plan to sign Divock Origi from Lille, who would then be loaned back. QPR's Loic Remy, Southampton's Dejan Lovren and Swansea's Ben Davies are the other players in their sights at this stage.

Wilfried Bony's price and wages are an obstacle that Tottenham and Liverpool are wrestling with and if the figures don't change he may well stay at Swansea.

Tottenham are also among clubs to have enquired about 23-year-old Mattia Destro at Roma but they are unlikely to pursue a deal for former Chelsea striker Samuel Eto'o, who it is understood has been offered to them.

Burnley have taken former Leeds United winger Gboly Ariyibi on trial. The 19-year-old endured a difficult loan spell at League One Tranmere last season but Sean Dyche is willing to give him a chance as he looks to inject some pace into his squad.

American-born Ariyibi came through Southampton's youth academy and was picked up by Leeds manager Brian McDermott as one to be developed for the future but the changes at Elland Road soon put paid to that.

Dortmund sign World Cup winner Ginter

Borussia Dortmund have completed the signing of Germany man Matthias Ginter. Although Ginter, 20, can also play as a defensive midfielder, the deal has increased speculation that Dortmund may be willing to allow Mats Hummels to leave.

Manchester United and Barcelona have both been linked with Hummels but the Spanish side are concentrating on Jeremy Mathieu at Valencia.

United have watched Hummels for some time but had reservations about his lack of pace with injuries having taken their toll. He remains outstanding in the box but may struggle if in a high line of defence.

New manager Louis van Gaal remains keen on Arsenal's Thomas Vermaelen and Roma midfielder Kevin Strootman but there are talks planned between staff and some Dutch agents at a Manchester hotel which may clarify other targets.

United are not pursuing Arturo Vidal at Juventus, though.

Shola Ameobi is the latest Premier League player to be courted by clubs in China. Fresh from his World Cup exploits with Nigeria, the former Newcastle striker is a free agent and weighing up offers from home and abroad.

Chinese clubs are willing to pay lucrative contracts but it's not always easy convincing players to go. Guangzhou Evergrande, coached by Marcello Lippi last week signed Alberto Gilardino to join former West Ham forward Alessandro Diamanti.

They have agreed to match his wages at Genoa plus bonuses which are understood to be around £4m a year. Guangzhou R and F made an approach for Ameobi in February and remain keen on the 32-year-old.

Hammer time for Taider

West Ham have been offered the chance to sign Inter Milan midfielder Saphir Taider.

The 22-year-old Algeria playmaker was one of several of his countrymen to impress at the World Cup and Inter, who are in the throes of rebuilding, are ready to sell to re-inforce their squad in other areas.

West Ham would prefer a loan but have other options. They are pursuing left-backs, another wide player and a centre-back.

Benatia on Chelsea's radar

Chelsea have expressed an interest in Roma defender Mehdi Benatia. As reported in Sportsmail, the 27-year-old is an option for Manchester City and Manchester United also.

However, Chelsea are keeping a keener eye on talks between Raphael Varane and Real Madrid this week. If there is any indication that he could leave, Jose Mourinho will try and sign the French defender who he rates as one of the best in the world.

The 21-year-old, a favourite of Castilla coach Zinedine Zidane, wants re-assurances about his role in the team with Carlo Ancelotti favouring he more experienced Pepe and Sergio Ramos for most of last season.

Michu close to Napoli move

Napoli expect to wrap up the finer details of Michu's transfer from Swansea today. The 28-year-old Michu was due to fly to Verona today before getting a connection to Dimaro, in Trentino, northern Italy, where Napoli hold their pre-season training camps.

The deal will be a loan with a guaranteed £8million to follow at the end of the season. Swansea's Pablo Hernandez is close to finalising his move to Al Arabi but they expect to finalise Jefferson Montero's transfer from Monarca Morelia.

Napoli have maintained interest in Tottenham's Sandro and may try to offer Valon Behrami as part of negotiations having baulked at the initial £20m valuation of Sandro.
