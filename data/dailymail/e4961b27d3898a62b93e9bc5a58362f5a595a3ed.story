Former University of Oklahoma fraternity member Levi Pettit publicly apologized this afternoon for leading a racist chant aboard a bus in a leaked video that shocked the nation.

Pettit, who grew up in a wealthy  suburb of Dallas, Texas, started his contrition tour with one of his most vocal critics - state Senator Anastasia Pittman.

Pittman accepted his apology, but said it's not enough - that he needs to offer contrition to black church leaders and students, as well. 

'Some have wondered why I hadn't spoken out publicly. The truth is I have had a mix of pain, shame, sorrow and fear over the consequences of my actions,' said Pettit, whose voice quivered slightly as he spoke. 'I did not want to apologize to the press or to the whole country until I first came to apologize to those most directly impacted.'

Mea culpa: Levi Pettit, one of the University of Oklahoma frat boys who led a racist chant on a bus last month, publicly apologized for his actions Wednesday after meeting with a group of black leaders

What he said: The 20-year-old, who has been expelled from OU, said he was 'upset and embarrassed' that he failed to stop the chant. He also claimed he did not know the words he was using were 'wrong' 

Addressing Senator Pittman directly, the 20-year-old expelled OU student said: 'You're a blessing to me, my mom, and my dad. I can't than you enough for the way you've embraced me and opened my eyes to things I had not seen before.' 

Pettit then formally apologized for his behavior, which was captured on camera last month, resulting in the disbandment of OU's chapter of the Sigma Epsilon Alpha fraternity.

'Let me start by saying that I am sorry, deeply sorry. I’m so sorry for all the pain that I’ve caused an I want you all to know that directly from me,' Pettit, dressed in a dark suit and red tie, said from a podium, surrounded by black leaders. 'Although I don’t deserve it, I want to ask for your forgiveness. There are no excuses for my behavior.'

The young Texan said he never considered himself to be a racist and added that he was 'upset and embarrassed' that he failed to stop the infamous chant on the bus filled with his fraternity brothers.

Mending fences: Pittman said she admires Pettit for having the courage to reach out to her 

'All the apologies in the world won’t change what I’ve done,' Pettit said off a podium at an Oklahoma City Baptist church.

When asked by a reporter whether he was aware in the moment that the words he was chanting were racial slurs, Pettit pleaded ignorance.

'I knew they were wrong, but I never knew how or why they were wrong,' he insisted. 'The people I've met with...have really opened my eyes to the impact of those words.

'The truth is what was said in that chant is disgusting ... and after meeting with these people I've learned these words should never be repeated,' he stated.  

Pettit answered only a few questions from reporters but declined to say who taught him the chant or where he learned it.

Pittman, D-Oklahoma City, said she believes Pettit's apology is genuine and she has forgiven him.

'I admire his courage of reaching out to me and saying: "I want to meet with you face to face and apologize to you directly,"' Pittman said. 'I believe he is sincere.'

Going forward, student groups at OU are considering inviting Pettit to participate in panel discussions on race relations at the university – but the events would have to take place off-campus or online because he has been barred from stepping foot on OU grounds after having been expelled. 

It comes as the high-power attorney hired by the now-disbanded Oklahoma chapter of Sigma Alpha Epsilon says no other members of the fraternity will be expelled over the incident.  

Thank you all for being here today. Even though I wish with all my heart today’s meeting was not necessary, I am deeply appreciative to the leaders that joined us.

Thank you Senator Pittman for inviting me here today - for you are a blessing to me and my mom and dad. I can never thank you enough for the way you have embraced me and opened my eyes to things I had not seen before.

Let me start by saying that I am sorry … deeply sorry. I am so sorry for the pain I have caused, and I want all of you to know that directly from me. Although not deserved, I ask for your forgiveness.

There are no excuses for my behavior. I never thought of myself as a racist. I never even considered the possibility. But the bottom line is that the words I said in the chant were mean, and hateful… and racist. I will be deeply sorry and deeply ashamed of what I have done for the rest of my life.

Some have wondered why I hadn’t spoken out publicly. The truth is I have had a mix of pain, shame, sorrow and fear over the consequences of my actions. I did not want to apologize to the press or to the whole country until I first came to apologize to those most directly impacted. So I decided it would be best to wait until the student and community leaders I met with today were back from Spring Break.

I think the best way to express the truth about who I am and what I feel is to read to you a letter that I sent to President Boren a few days after the bus ride.

The words in that letter are all heart-felt words, and I thank President Boren for accepting my apology.

Yesterday, I was humbled by the fact that I had a chance to meet face to face with members of the football leadership team. They accepted my apology and together discussed steps we can take to make sure this never happens again.

Over the past week or so, I have met with a number of pastors and leaders in the community to seek understanding of the meaning behind the words I spoke on the bus.

Meeting with a few people does not change what I did, but it has begun to change me, and my understanding of those hateful words. Without question, my words on that bus were disgusting and these words should never be repeated under any circumstance.

I am also upset and embarrassed that I failed to stand up as a leader and stop this chant. I now have a clearer understanding of what lives behind the words. From this point forward, I will be the leader I should have been on the bus and stand up against racism in any form.

Now, before I take a couple of your questions,

Let me just say this:

All the apologies in the world won’t change what I have done. So I will spend the rest of my life trying to be a person who heals and brings people of all races together. That is what I hope and pray will come out of this.

 

Oklahoma state Senator Anastasia Pittman, one of the most vocal critics of Sigma Alpha Epsilon, has arranged for Pettit to meet with black community leaders, including students, for him to apologize

Stephen Jones, who defended Oklahoma City bomber Timothy McVeigh says he reached a deal in his legal proceedings with the university. The other details of the agreement are not clear.

Before Pettit's brief press conference this afternoon, he met behind closed doors with top black politicians, pastors and students. 

'I wanted him to be educated on some of the struggles they've endured,' Pittman said. 

'I think that will enlighten him and give him a new perspective on a culture that he is completely unaware of.'

Pettit's parents outed him as one of the instigators of the song 'there will never be a n***** SAE,' which he was recorded singing gleefully on a bus full of members of the Sigma Alpha Epsilon fraternity. 

Pettit is one of two students expelled from Oklahoma over the video. The SAE fraternity was also kicked off campus and the brothers were evicted from their house by the university. Parker Rice is the other student identified on camera. 

Among those scheduled to attend the private meeting on Wednesday is Marilyn Luper-Hildreth, the daughter of the late civil rights leader Clara Luper, an Oklahoma City schoolteacher who led sit-ins at segregated Oklahoma City drugstore counters in the late 1950s. 

Pettit's parents, who live in the Dallas area, issued an apology on his behalf two weeks ago after the video's release caused an uproar on the university's campus in Norman, which is located about 20 miles south of Oklahoma City. A second student from the Dallas area, Parker Rice, also issued a statement apologizing for his role in the chant.

OU President David Boren severed ties with the fraternity, ordered its members to vacate the fraternity house and expelled two students for leading the chant. The university also launched an investigation into the role other fraternity members may have had in the chant, and Boren says further disciplinary action is possible.

The national Sigma Alpha Epsilon fraternity also disbanded its OU chapter and announced it is taking steps to become more inclusive, including requiring all of its members nationwide to go through diversity training and setting up a confidential hotline for people to report inappropriate behavior.

Boren also planned to meet later Wednesday with student leaders of the university's fraternity and sorority system to discuss race relations and the reaction of students to the incident.
