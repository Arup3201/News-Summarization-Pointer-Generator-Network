Tattooing or piercing your pet will become a crime in New York after new laws were introduced to ban the 'cruel' practice.

While people can choose the pain of tattoos or piercings to satisfy their own 'aesthetic predilections,' companion animals don't have that luxury said Assembly member Linda Rosenthal, who sponsored the legislation.  

'It's simply cruel,' added the Manhattan Democrat, after the law was signed in Monday by governor Andrew Cuomo. It will take effect in 120 days. 

The new laws were introduced after this picture of a Pit-bull mix called Zion was posted on Instagram by Brooklyn artist Alexander Avgerakis under the moniker 'Mistah Metro'.  Assembly member Linda Rosenthal, who sponsored the legislation called animal tattoos 'cruel'

'This is animal abuse, pure and simple,' Cuomo said after inking in the new law which will see penalties for violations range up to 15 days in jail and fines of up to $250, according to staff at his office.

Rosenthal's chief of staff Lauren Schuster said support grew this year after a Brooklyn tattoo artist posted a photograph of his tattooed dog online in March. 

'My dog is cooler than yours,' bragged Alexander Avgerakis, who uses the moniker 'Mistah Metro', when he posted a picture of his poor pit-bull mix, called Zion, on his Instagram account. 

'She had her spleen removed yesterday, and the vet let me tattoo her while she was under (anaesthetic),' he wrote next to the image of his zonked out pooch, which has since been deleted. 

Inked onto a shaven area on the dog's shoulder, the heart tattoo was inked with the names Alex and Mel. 

At the time, a spokesman for the American Veterinary Medical Association said they had policies against tattoos because, 'it's not good for the dog.' 

Those views were backed up by Teresa Chagrin, an animal care and control specialist for People for Ethical Treatment of Animals (PETA) who said that tattoos caused pain to the animals.  

Tattooing and piercing animals violates existing laws against animal cruelty in all 50 states, she said, adding that it wasn't immediately aware if other states that clarified their laws like New York did.

After posting the picture, Avgerakis explained his dog had just had to have her spleen removed and was still under anaesthetic when the tattoo was done. But the American Veterinary Medical Association said they had policies against tattoos because, 'it's not good for the dog'

Avgerakis later removed the post. Anyone attempting to tattoo or pierce their dog in New York will face penalties which range up to 15 days in jail and fines of up to $250, according to staff at governor Andrew Cuomo's office

However, Schuster said she thought Pennsylvania was the first state to introduce similar laws, following the 2011 case of a woman who was piercing kittens and selling them on the internet as 'gothic.

Similar legislation was introduced this summer in New Jersey. 

The New York law will however, exempt markings done under a veterinarian's supervision for a medical reason or identification.

Rosenthal said that's intended, for example, for pets like her cat, which was spayed by a vet and given a little green mark to indicate that.

Any identification tattoos should include only numbers and letters allotted for a tattoo identification registry.   

The law also does not apply to ear tags on rabbits and guinea pigs.
