There were only 27,099 supporters there to see it but Barcelona's lowest crowd of the season watched them give one of their most ruthless displays beating La Liga's bottom club Elche 5-0 in the Copa del Rey.

Jeers for Luis Enrique and cheers for Lionel Messi echoed around the 98,000 capacity arena early in the first half. The coach is still battling to save his job and he picked his strongest possible side with Messi, Neymar and Luis Suarez reunited up front - all three scored in the first half to all but put Barca in the Cup quarter-finals where they will face Atletico Madrid or Real Madrid after the formality of next week's second leg.

Many Barcelona supporters were left asking why tinkerman Luis Enrique had rested Gerard Pique, Dani Alves, Ivan Rakitic, Neymar and Messi in the previous Sunday's difficult trip to Real Sociedad to then play them all against lowly Elche who are currently the worst side in Spanish football.

Neymar, Luis Suarez and Lionel Messi proved to be too strong for La Liga strugglers Elche during the Copa del Rey clash at the Nou Camp.

The home side got back to winning ways after losing to Real Sociedad by scoring five goals against their opponents.

A double by Neymar and goals from Suarez, Messi and Alba ensured Barcelona pretty much guaranteed their place in the next round of the Copa del Rey, despite there being another 90 minutes of the two-legged tie.

That's all from me, stay tuned to MailOnline for all the latest news in the world of sport.

I told you he looked disappointed. Neymar was consoled by team-mate Adriano when leaving the pitch.

Pedro goes close to making it 6-0. The Barcelona substitute tries to lob Tyton but his effort fails to hit the target.

Tyton stretches down to his left to save a free-kick by Messi. The Elche goalkeeper has actually played OK despite conceding five goals. There's 10 minutes to go at the Nou Camp.

Messi and Suarez remain on the pitch as Enrique elects to take off... a defender. Pique is replaced by Samper which results in Mascherano shifting to a more defensive position. 

Enrique may have decided to take off Neymar in order to protect the Brazilian from injury. He appeared to pick up a knock on his shin but was still unhappy at being denied the chance to grab a hat-trick. 

Neymar looked disappointed after coming off but Enrique is looking at the bigger picture. Atletico Madrid at home will be no easy challenge. Just ask Real Madrid. 18 minutes left here at the Nou Camp.

Neymar is denied the chance of scoring a hat-trick as Enrique decides to replace the Brazilian with Pedro.

Their defeat against Real Sociedad appears to be out of Barcelona's system. They are having fun out there on the Nou Camp turf.

Barcelona don't appear to be easing off and Enrique is yet to take off any of his attacking players. Elche will want the referee to end the game now.

Neymar gets his second with the goal of the match so far. He cuts inside before lashing the ball past the diving Tyton, who clutches at thin air.

Messi unlocks Elche's defence once again with a delightful ball to Barcelona left back Jordi Alba. The Spain international scores by placing the ball through the legs of Tyton.

Former Barcelona midfielder Yaya Toure has just been named Africa's player of the year for a record fourth straight year. His former fans will be proud.

Just 27,099 fans have attended today's game at the Nou Camp. 

Messi acknowledged the Barcelona crowd after scoring his side's third goal of the match. 

Barcelona face Atletico Madrid at the weekend, so Enrique may decide to rest the likes of Suarez and Neymar during the latter stages of this game. 

Enrique's side have had 11 shots at goal whereas Elche have had none. 

The home side scored their three goals in the space of 10 minutes. Elche will be pleased to get back into the dressing room as Barca were starting to move into second gear. 

Messi wouldn't have been content with his performance unless he got on the scoresheet. It was a blatant penalty on Neymar by Enzo Roco, who received a yellow card for the part he played in the incident.

Barcelona found their stride in the closing stages of the first half with their key players all getting on the scoresheet. Neymar, Suarez and Messi are far too good for this Elche side.

Messi adds a third just before half-time with a low penalty past Tyton.

Barcelona have been awarded a penalty as Neymar has been taken down inside the area.

Suarez follows up his assist for Neymar's open with a goal of his own. The former Liverpool forward jinks his way past Elche's defender before beating Tyton at the near post.

Neymar puts his side in the lead by ending an outstanding Barcelona move. The Brazilian has the easy task of tapping the ball into an empty net after intricate play by Messi and Suarez.

Enrique may choose to turn to Iniesta, pictured below, or Pedro during the second half if his side fails to unlock Elche's defence. 

Suarez has scored just three goals for Barcelona since joining the club in the summer. The Uruguayan will not be too pleased with his form at the club so far. 

Neymar latches on to a cross by Messi but his cross-cum-shot towards the fast post goes narrowly wide. Barca are starting to pile on the pressure with just under 30 minutes on the clock. 

Luis Enrique has failed to name the same starting line-up since taking over the reins at the Nou Camp. He has picked 26 different line-ups during his time at the club.

Luis Suarez just blocked a goalwards shot by team-mate Ivan Rakitic. His time at the club really hasn't gone to plan since his move to the Nou Camp.

Barcelona will be glad to get back on the football pitch after a hectic week at the Catalan giants. It is all change with Carles Puyol and sporting director Andoni Zubizarreta leaving the club. Will Luis Enrique be smiling at the end of tonight's match though? 

The resulting free-kick ended with Dani Alves going close to putting his side in the league. Tyton punched Messi's free-kick to the Brazilian defender who unleashed a ferocious shot which whistled past the post.

Lionel Messi and Co. are finding it hard to break down Elche. However they do have a free-kick on the edge of Elche's box...

Barcelona have won the Copa del Rey a record 26 times with their last triumph in the competition coming in the 2011-12 season. Luis Enrique will be hoping he can help his side add to their outstanding record.

Lionel Messi jigs his way into a shooting position however his shot goes into the arms of Elche goalkeeper Tyton. 

Neymar and the Barcelona crowd make an appeal for a penalty but the referee waves away the protests. Elche will be pleased they haven't conceded after 10 minutes.

Both Barcelona and Elche paid tribute to Fernando de Arcilla before the match at the Camp Nou.

Elche are giving Barcelona's players the space and time to control the game. You get the feeling the likes of Rakitic and Neymar will enjoy tonight's game.

Neymar and Luis Suarez link up to create the first real chance of the match but Elche's defence manage to stand firm. Their defence will face a tough task against Barca's attacking players.

Just in case you missed it, former Barcelona goalkeeper Victor Valdes has signed an 18 month deal at Manchester United. 

Elche have struggled for form in La Liga this season, winning just two of of their 17 league games. They will be hoping for better luck in the Copa del Rey but will face a tough challenge at the Nou Camp.

Elche starting line-up: Tyton, Damian, Roco, Lombán, Cisma, Herrera, Coro, Pelegrín, Faycal, Edu Albacar, Pasalic

Barcelona boss Luis Enrique has made eight changes to the side which were beaten 1-0 by David Moyes' Real Sociedad at the weekend. 

The likes of Lionel Messi, Dani Alves and Neymar have all returned to Barca's starting line-up for the Copa del Rey clash against Elche.

Barcelona starting line-up: Ter Stegen; Alves, Pique, Bartra, Alba; Roberto, Mascherano, Rakitic; Messi, Neymar, Suarez
