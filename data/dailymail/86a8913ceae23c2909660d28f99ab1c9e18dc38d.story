When it comes to booking a cruise, the myriad choice of ships can leave holidaymakers feeling overwhelmed.

Now a cruise company has produced an infographic that explains the options on offer, along with some staggering cruise-related facts.

Cruise1st's graphic has been released to coincide with the final episode of ITV's The Cruise 
Ship.

The four-part documentary goes behind the scenes on board the passenger ship Royal Princess, which was launched last June by the
 Duchess of Cambridge.

The infographic reveals that a record 1.79 million British holidaymakers took a cruise in 2013 and 21.7 million people worldwide plan to book a trip this year.

Passenger figures have risen by 21 per cent in the past five years and the average cruise lasts 7.2 days.

The Caribbean is the top destination, followed by the Mediterranean and Europe. Far-flung destinations in Australia, New Zealand, Alaska, Asia and South America are also a hit with travellers.

Passengers
 said they enjoyed cruising because it offered value for money, 
‘amazing’ destinations, fine dining, and meant that they could travel 
far but only had to unpack once.

They
 also like the fact that the ships were a 'floating resort for all' and 
they could choose to do little or a lot on their trip.

Cruise giant: Royal Caribbean International's Allure of the Seas is the world's largest cruise ship

Floating resort: Allure of the Seas is as big as three and half football fields and nearly four times longer than Big Ben clock tower

The majority of modern cruise ships are at least twice the size of the Titanic but the so-called ‘megaships’ tower above the competition, carrying over 6,000 passengers on board.

At 362 metres, Royal Caribbean International's Allure of the Seas is the world’s largest cruise ship, equal to 
three and half football fields and nearly four times longer than Big Ben
 clock tower.

Weighing a staggering 225,300 tonnes - the equivalent of 9,000 warrior army tanks - it can carry 6,296 guests and 2,384 crew, has 2,700 rooms, and required 158,503 gallons of paint 
to decorate it.

If the ship's electrical cables were laid end to end, they would stretch from Fort Lauderdale in Florida to Juneau in Alaska.

Costly: Smaller luxury cruise ships such as Silverseas' ship Silver Whisper cater to a more 'exclusive' clientele and offer longer itineraries to exotic ports

Next up are the mainstream cruise 
ships, such as Cunard's ocean liner Queen Mary 2, which is longer than the Eiffel Tower 
and weighs the equivalent of 21,200 double decker buses.

The
 graphic reveals that the famous ship once carried the first U.S. copy 
of J.K. Rowling’s book Harry Potter and the Half-Blood Prince across the
 Atlantic in a locked steamer trunk.

The smaller
 luxury cruise ships, such as Silverseas' ship Silver Whisper, cater to a more 'exclusive' clientele and offer longer itineraries to 
more exotic ports.

Silver Whisper carries 382 passengers, weighs the equivalent of 175 Boeing 747 jumbo jets and just pips the Statue of Liberty when it comes to length.

Finally, the relatively small adventure vessels, such as Windstar Cruises' ship Wind Spirit, are usually sail-powered and frequently visit out-of-the-way destinations that are inaccessible to larger ships.

The Wind Spirit is slightly longer than Nelson's Column at 110 metres long, carries 148 passengers and weighs the equivalent of 3,800 average family cars.
