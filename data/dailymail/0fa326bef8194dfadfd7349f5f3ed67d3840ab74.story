A three-year-old boy from Virginia accidentally shot and wounded his twin brother on Monday morning after handling an unattended firearm in his mother's home.

The three-year-old who was shot is in critical condition at VCU Medical center after a .25 caliber bullet went through his bottom and into his abdomen after his mother rushed him to the hospital. The young shooter, also injured, was taken to his mother's boyfriend's other girlfriend's house.

The twins' mother Reashonda Jones, 28, along with her boyfriend Lewis Walter Jones, 29, who sometimes goes by the first names 'Masson' or 'Smoke' are deemed fugitives.

The tragic shooting occurred at the housing project in Hopewell, Virginia off 8th street where the family live

Lewis 
Walter Jones allegedly took the twin who shot his brother to his other 
girlfriend's house at Fourth and Poythress Streets and thereby captured a witness to a crime.

'He
 was taking a potential witness. Even though they’re only three, it’s 
potentially obstruction of justice,'said CBS-6 legal analyst Todd Stone. 

'You have a lot of issues at play.'

According to wanted posters emailed from The Hopewell Police Department to The Mail Online, Reashonda is wanted for Possession of a Firearm by a convicted Felon, Filing a False Police Report, and Felony Child Neglect.

Lewis Walter is wanted for Felony Child Neglect, Obstruction of Justice, and Evidence Tampering.

Hopewell Police Chief John Keohane said that there are several conflicting versions of the story following the shooting. 

Cops originally thought that the shooting might have occurred in the playground at the Hopewell project but evidence found in the home trumped that theory

He said that one thing was certain, however.

'There was a child that got his hands on a firearm and used it,' said Keohane.

He also said that they boy who 'shot his brother' also had injuries such as potential burns or worse.

'We are not sure if the action of the .25 caught him on the hand as it recycled the round,' said Keohane.

Police originally thought that the shooting might have happened in the playground but they later found a . 25 caliber shell casing at the mother's home where the family live.

'In the hood you hear one story but the real story isn’t out yet,' said Joe Marsh, who lives in the housing project.

Police were able to collect evidence on Monday along with an impounded car and two guns.

Police say that the shooting could have been prevented had the weapon been properly locked and stored.

'It’s matter of inches and this whole thing could’ve changed,' said Keohane. 'It’s disturbing.'

Reashonda Sharelle Jones is 5'6" and weighs 180 pounds.

Lewis Walter Jones is 5'6" and weighs 170 pounds.

Anyone with information regarding the whereabouts of the fugitives are asked to call 804-541-2202.

Lewis Walter Jones has been known to change his date of birth by one year and change the last number of his social security number to avoid being identified by law enforcement.

Police say Child Services are also involved in the case.
