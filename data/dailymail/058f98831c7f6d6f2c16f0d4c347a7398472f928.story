Xavi has been named Barcelona's new skipper for the forthcoming campaign after getting the nod from his team-mates.

The armband has been vacant after Carles Puyol hung up his boots at the end of the season, with a vote determining his successor.

Spanish star Xavi topped the poll, which was announced on Thursday, closely followed by Andrés Iniesta, Lionel Messi and Sergio Busquets, who will be vice-captains.

Main man: Xavi has finally got the armband after six years as second in command

Xavi has been waiting in the wings for the past six years, but has finally been awarded the honour after one-club man Puyol retired. 

Messi and Busquets are both newcomers to the role, despite skippering the side during isolated incidents in the past.

Xavi will lead his team out as the new captain for the first time when Barcelona kick off their La Liga campaign against Elche on August 24.

Pointing the way: Lionel Messi has the added responsibility of being a vice-captain this campaign
