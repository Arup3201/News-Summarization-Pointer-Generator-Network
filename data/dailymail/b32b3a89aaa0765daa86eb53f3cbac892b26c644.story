Aggression: Lord West has called for Britain to send a nuclear submarine to the Falkland Islands to signal the intention to defend the territory if Argentina attempts another invasion

A former head of the British Navy has said 'aggressive' demands by Argentina over the Falkland Islands should be countered by sending a nuclear submarine to the region.

Lord West has also suggested staging a exercise demonstrating Britain's ability to reinforce the South Atlantic islands would leave Buenos Aires in no doubt the country would defend them in case of conflict.

The peer slammed a new agreement by Argentina, Brazil and Uruguay to ban ships that fly the Falklands flag from their ports as 'outrageous'.

Speaking to London's Evening Standard, he said: 'They are basically becoming more and more aggressive. I find that worrying.

'Far
from trying to settle in a grown-up way and having better and better 
relations with the Falkland islanders, they are upping the ante and 
becoming confrontational.'

He
added that he did not believe Argentina would launch another invasion, 
but that sending a nuclear submarine to 'stick its mast up' as it 
patrolled the area would signal Britain's intent.

The former First Sea 
Lord, who commanded HMS Ardent on which 22 crew were killed during the 
Falklands War in 1982, added: 'When one is there, we should make a point
of making it clear that it is there.'

The
Foreign Office has condemned the decision to ban vessels flying the 
Falklands flag from entering ports in the three countries.

A spokesman said: 'We are very 
concerned by the latest Argentine attempt to isolate the Falkland 
Islands people and damage their livelihoods, for which there is no 
justification.

'No one should doubt our determination to protect the Falkland islanders' right to determine their own political future.'

Tensions were already high in the 
region after Argentina intensified its campaign of intimidation against 
fishing boats operating with UK licences.

Tensions: Uruguay President Jose Mujia and Argentinian counterpart Cristina Fernandez de Kirchner at the Mercosur summit in Montevideo. The bloc announces ships with Falkland Islands flags would be banned from its ports

In
the latest breach of international law earlier this month, Spanish 
vessels bound for the islands were intercepted and boarded by troops.

Today
Uruguayan president Jose Mujica said at a summit for the Mercosur 
trading block - which also includes landlocked Paraguay - in the capital
Montevideo that solidarity among South America's neighbours was key to 
his country's foreign policy.

He said: 'For the moment, this means accepting that this territory is a colonial British position in our America.'

Mr Mujica said British-flagged civilian ships that may supply the islands would be allowed to use its ports, but not military vessels.

The decision by the countries is the latest in a series by Latin American authorities designed to show solidarity with Argentina, which calls the islands Las Malvinas.

Roger Spink, president of the Falklands Chamber of Commerce, said they were a small community and felt increasingly under blockade.

He told the BBC: 'If we were Palestine, the European Union would be up in arms.'

The dispute has created a fresh diplomatic headache for Britain.

Last week Uruguay said it was banning ships flying the Falkland Islands flag from its ports, prompting the Foreign Office to call on Uruguay's ambassador in London to explain the move.

The government in Buenos Aires has stepped up its official policy of blockading the British territory by ordering its navy to board ships that it claims are fishing there illegally.

Argentine president Cristina Fernandez de Kirchner last year issued a decree requiring all vessels passing through its territorial waters to and from the Falklands to secure consent from Buenos Aires.

President Kirchner secured a record election win in October as she was voted back into office with 54.1 per cent of the vote. Her nearest challenger was more than 37 per cent behind.

Diplomats have played down the escalation of tensions over the Falklands as 'sabre-rattling' by President Kirchner as she campaigned for reelection, despite the islanders' wish to remain British.

A top Argentine official hanged himself during the summit meeting of Mercosur.

Ivan
Heyn, the under secretary of foreign trade and a rising star in 
President Cristina Fernandez de Kirchner's government, was found dead at
the Radisson Hotel in Montevideo.

Ms
Kirchner was so upset on hearing the news she left a meeting of South 
American leaders and had to be treated by a medical team.

Argentina's
embassy confirmed Mr Heyn's death and said Uruguayan authorities were 
taking 'all necessary legal steps with regard to this tragic incident'.

Mr Heyn, 33, was an economist who belonged to the Peronist youth group La Campora that supports Ms Kirchner's government.

A
former leader of the Argentine University Federation, he occupied other
positions in the Economy Ministry during Ms Kirchner's first term and 
took up his new post just 10 days ago.

But Argentina managed to secure a resolution from 32 Latin American states at a conference endorsing its claim to the islands, which were ceded to Britain in 1833.

The row began to escalate in January last year when oil exploration rigs arrived off the islands.

Rockhopper Exploration, which carried out test drilling in the waters around the islands, said in September it had made significant finds and could begin pumping by 2016.

Britain has around 1,200 service personnel on the islands, and there are three Royal Navy warships in the area along with four RAF Typhoon fighter bombers.

In 1982, Argentina's junta invaded the islands. Then prime minister Margaret Thatcher sent a task force including aircraft carriers equipped with Harrier jump jets and an invasion force to retake the territory.

A 74-day war claimed the lives of 649 Argentines and 255 Britons as the Falklands were successfully defended.

Concerns have been raised, however, that defence cuts this year could leave the territory vulnerable to another attack by Argentina.

Former military chiefs said in September the dwindling budget left the islands 'ripe for picking' if Buenos Aires invaded with support from its allies.

The United Kingdom National Defence Association report urged ministers to boost military spending from 2 to 3 per cent of GDP, and warned Britain would struggle to repel Argentine forces if they were supported by China, for example.

It said: 'Once lost, the islands would be very difficult to retake, particularly with no air cover over a task force.

'Our assessment is that current force levels are inadequate to hold off even a small-size invasion.'
