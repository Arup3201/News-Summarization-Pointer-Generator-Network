David Cameron is testing an iPad app that helps him run the country.

Developed by the Cabinet Office, it is called the 'Number 10 Dashboard', and lets Cameron and other ministers see key information at a glance.

A description of the app says that 'with a few taps or swipes of his fingers, he can see very quickly what important new information has come to light, how certain government services are performing, and a selection of relevant and important news reports'.

The Prime Minister is testing a 'Number 10 Dashboard' app to help him keep on top of Government business.

The app is hosted by the Government Digital Service (GDS) inside the Cabinet Office, and consists of a number of onscreen tiles, each of which can be selected to show more detail.

They include:

Mr Cameron has been using it to keep track of live data relating to jobs, housing and other areas, it has been confirmed.

Alice Netwon, one of the developers behind the project,  worked with him, giving him early versions of the app and getting direct feedback.

'It's a dashboard to give the prime minister and other senior official the most up to date view of government priorities from housing to national business or growth,' she said.

'They will have access to the latest government and external data, as well as commentary and analysis by top analysts in the government.

''When the prime minister opens up the app the first thing he will see is a page giving him the daily political context.

Miss Newton worked with the PM to develop the project.

'This had been built with the Prime Minister.

'It was incredible valuable to speak to my users, but my favourite thing he said was that he was looking forward to showing it to Obama at the G8.'

Miss Newton said Mr Cameron 'in particular liked the statistical side, where we could give him quotable facts about what was going on,' she said on a website about the project.'

It also monitors polls and posts on social media, allowing the PM to instantly see reaction to policies and news events.

Much on the work on the app has been around making it simple to understand, and the Cabinet Office said data would be 'visualised in a very simple, easy-to-digest way.'

The Cabinet Office said the app would be offered to more government figures next year.

Mr Cameron is 'looking forward to showing it to President Obama at the G8 summit', a person working on the project told the BBC.

Mr Cameron's iPad was a gift from Apple, according to a gift list disclosed by the government, and he has previously admitted to being a huge fan of the game Angry Birds.

The new app, which is actually a web page, was developed by the Cabinet Office's digital team and takes data from sources including Google, Twitter and Facebook, putting them on a single page.

The app is believed to resemble the data.gov.uk site with large tiles showing key information

The Cabinet Office confirmed to the BBC today it was 'working on a data visualisation dashboard to provide ministers and civil servants with information on key public services as well as other indicators.

'The dashboard is in working form and is now undergoing further development'.

The app is believed to have a look and feel similar to that of the government's data website, data.gov.uk.

A Cabinet Office source confirmed to the BBC that the app, which is still in its testing phase, is currently on the prime minister's iPad, as well as devices used by a select group of staff within the Cabinet Office.

It is believed the app will be rolled out across Government next year as part of a major digital overhaul.

'If you want to provide ministers and officials with information about performance of government, you can look at government data - but you can also look at data from the real world,' said the source.

'All we're doing is bringing government into line with what leading companies, big and small, have been doing for several years.

'It's radical for government, but it's not radical for 2012.'

The Prime Minister recently boasted that he had completed every level of the game Angry Birds.

At the time, Andy Payne of the Association for UK Interactive 
Entertainment, who met Mr Cameron to discuss gaming, said: ‘He 
absolutely loves it. He wants to know what other top games he should get
for his iPad.'
