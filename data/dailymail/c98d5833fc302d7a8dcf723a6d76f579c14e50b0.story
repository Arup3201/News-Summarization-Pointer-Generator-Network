A man who allegedly made bombs for a terrorist group responsible for a string of attacks in New York more than 40-years ago has been revealed to be living in leafy suburbia as a high school teacher.

Ronald Fliegelman is said to have built explosives for the far-left group Weather Underground who ran a terrifying campaign across the country during the 1970s.

But according to a new book seen byThe New York Post, after avoiding prison on a technicality he managed to build a successful, 25-year career in the classroom after the group disbanded - and still hasn't served a day in prison.

Bryan Burrough's book, Days of Rage: America's Radical Underground, the FBI, and the Forgotten Age of Revolutionary Violence, states Fliegelman is now living a quiet life in Park Slope in Brooklyn after retiring.

But the author, who also penned the books Public Enemies about America's crime wave in the 1930s and 40s, say's the culprit is not sorry for what he has done.

Burroughs told The Post: 'Ron is proud of what he did.'

The Weathermen, as they were popularly known, was set up in 1969 and run by the co-founder Bill Ayers. 

He went on to become a University of Chicago professor and his friendship with Barack Obama was questioned during the 2008 race for the White House.

The group was  mostly of white and middle class and advocated the overthrow of the US government. 

Their name was based on the Bob Dylan lyric: 'You don't need a weatherman to know which way the wind blows.' 

In 1970 they waged they issued a 'Declaration of a State of War' against the United States.

The same year a bomb exploded inside a Greenwich Village, New York, residence prematurely, killing three members. 

They also staged attacks on the Capitol Building in Washington D.C after the invasion of Laos in 1971, and targeted the New York Department of Corrections building in Albany after 29 inmates died during the Attica prison riot the same year. 

According to The Post one of the Weathermen told Burroughs: 'We believed Third World countries would rise up and cause crises that would bring down the industrialized West, and we believed it was going to happen tomorrow, or maybe the day after tomorrow.'

Former group member Howie Machtinger added: 'The myth, and this is always Bill Ayers’ line, is that Weather never set out to kill people, and it’s not true — we did. 

'You know, policemen were fair game.' 

The New York Post approached Fliegelman in leafy Park Slope and asked him about his past.

'What happened 40 years ago is different from what’s going on today. War was a big thing. It was on TV every night. You don’t know that with the Iraqi war, the Afghanistan war. There was the draft, as well,' said Fliegelman.

When it was put to the 70-year-old that he was a not a freedom fighter but a terrorist, he reportedly disagreed.

'Did you ever notice how many people were hurt by our bombs? People were not hurt by our bombs,' said Fliegelman.
