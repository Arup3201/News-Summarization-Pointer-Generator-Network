Mady White shared a picture of herself with one of Moo's kittens before Moo was gruesomely killed

The woman whose cat was decapitated in a gruesome attack last month has fled the Gold Coast after a sustained hate campaign against her.

Mady White, 20, was the owner of a cat named Moo, whose head and paws were cut off and whose blood was used to write a threatening message on a garage door in Arundel on the Gold Coast on June 17.

The message 'Whers [sic] my money? Tik tok!' was found daubed on the garage door, in what was believed to be a revenge attack against the homeowners.

Jordan Isaiah Christie, 19, was charged with injuring animals, wilful damage and arson after Moo's body was found on the doorstep of a house.

Christie faced court on July 1 and was denied bail because he was deemed an 'unacceptable risk' of him reoffending.

Ms White told Daily Mail Australia that she was shocked to discover the dead cat in news reports was hers and said she didn't believe her cat had been specifically targeted.

'Pretty much it was my cat being in the wrong place at the wrong time,' she said.

Ms White, who suffers from cystic fibrosis, said she was deeply affected by the death of her cat and spent two to three weeks in hospital after Moo was killed.

'The stress makes me sick. Whenever I get put under too much pressure I get sick,' she told Daily Mail Australia.

Ms White said her problems have continued in the month since her cat was killed.

Her home has been broken into twice since the incident and her car was stolen, which Ms White thinks is part of a sustained hate campaign against her, leading her to flee the Gold Coast.

Ms White said her cat's death was the first in a series of 'payback' crimes against her

Ms White's cat was used in a gruesome crime last month, though Ms White believes her cat was just in the wrong place at the wrong time

Ms White said her black Holden Cruze was stolen on Wednesday after she gave a lift to someone she knew.

'I was doing a friend a favour, I was giving him a lift, he held a weapon to me and told me to get out of the car,' Ms White said.

The theft was particularly devastating because her car contained a month's supply of an experimental drug worth $30,000 that treats cystic fibrosis.

Ms White has now gone six days without the medication, Kalydeco, which must be administered 12 hours apart and she said her condition has already begun to deteriorate.

As well as her car being stolen, Ms White's house was broken into twice – on the night of carjacking and on the following night.

'Phones, money, jewellery, clothes –  all were taken. As was my wallet, my ID, my Medicare card, my health care card, cash,' she said.

At the time of the break-ins Ms White had a friend and her friend's baby living with her.

'She was very terrified for her child,' said Ms White.

Ms White is convinced the three events, which she has reported to police, are related and are part of a sustained hate campaign against her.

'I don't think it's about the cat thing,' she told Daily Mail Australia. 'The person who took my car thinks I've done something to him, which I haven't done.'

She believes the person who stole her car also orchestrated her house burglaries and 'wants to get more people to target me'.

Ms White has fled the Gold Coast and is now staying with family.

'I just want to get away and get healthy. I don't even want to be in the Gold Coast anymore.'

Ms White says she is not scared, but she wants the abuse to end.

'I don't know what to feel. I haven't personally been threatened, but everything of value to me has been taken.'

Police are searching for Ms White's car, which was involved in a petrol drive-off at a service station on Sunday night.

Yesterday morning the car was spotted in the Arundel area but police were not successful in apprehending the offenders.
