England are much improved under the stewardship of Stuart Lancaster, but I can’t help feeling Wednesday’s announcement can only damage our chances for next year’s World Cup.

Lancaster, Andy Farrell, Graham Rowntree and Mike Catt have developed into a settled and effective coaching team and have established a working environment that has produced results and shown great promise. Starting with four great Test matches next month, we are in for a hugely exciting year, culminating in a home World Cup with these men rightfully at the helm.

I believe they will all remain within the England set-up for some time. Indeed, I have always felt Lancaster would eventually move up to a director of rugby position, with Farrell taking the helm as head coach. I can also see the business sense from the RFU’s perspective - the announcement implies belief, stability and consistency in the set-up.

But nobody was crying out for the coaching team to change, no-one was concerned they would be snapped up by other nations. So why make such a public announcement?

Is the RFU going public good for England’s World Cup hopes? No.

It is a distraction that could diminish the team’s hunger and fear factor. All of England’s coaches are thoroughly professional and those who know them best will testify that their determination and drive will be a safeguard against complacency. But I am talking about the potential for the smallest of subconscious slips - and equally importantly, the smallest of fillips for the opposition.

Coaching in elite sport is not about job security, it is about knowing that if you lose the next few games, you’re history.

I wouldn’t want my players thinking about the coach being around for years to come while their position is forever on the line. I’d rather they thought: ‘This guy’s job is on the line, so I’ll put my body on the line for him.’

The extensions are deserved but can only do harm rather than good to England's 2015 World Cup challenge

On the opposite side of the coin, if I was in the New Zealand or Australian camps I’d be thinking: ‘So they think they’ve cracked it? I’m hungrier than the bloke in the tracksuit up in the stand. I’ve got more to play for.’

It is a problem of perception that could have been avoided.

Throughout my time as England coach, one of my mantras was that everyone’s noses must be pointed in the same direction. Right now, every nose in the England set-up should be pointed at a home World Cup.

Every sinew and brain cell should be focused on next year: the 2015 World Cup will set the tone for the development of rugby in this country for a long time. We must get every detail right.

My 2003 England team agreed that there would be no distracting announcements as we went into the World Cup. It was clear that some of the senior players would be retiring, but nothing was said as it would have created a sideshow.

Similarly, I signed a contract extension as we were getting ready to fly to Australia. Again, nothing was announced. That time had to be about England, not about individuals.

Lancaster has done a terrific job, picking up England from a low point after the last World Cup. I don’t want anything to damage that progress at such a crucial point in the international cycle.

The closer you get to a World Cup, the tougher it gets for an international coach. Every year gets harder. All the big national sides renew their focus, they turn the intensity of their game up a notch or two.

On Wednesday we learned that the England coaching team will also prepare the team for the 2019 World Cup. We didn’t need to know that. No-one should be thinking that far ahead. Let’s deal with 2015 first!

The real test of how far England have progressed comes next year, in brutal World Cup pool clashes against Australia and Wales.

Awarding these contracts could also undermine ambition. It could erode the ambition of other Premiership coaches who think they should have a crack at coaching England. It could also kill the ambition of players who are outside the England set-up. Lancaster’s team will think the news is great, that their man is now secure in the job for years to come. But what about the Ciprianis and the Armitages? No matter how much Lancaster says he is keeping the door open, they will fear international rugby has passed them by.

There’s an interesting debate to be had as to whether an international coach has a natural shelf-life, a time after which new ideas are needed.

We certainly haven’t reached that stage. Lancaster and his fellow coaches have already proved enough to deserve an extended run in the job. But I fear their new deals could hang over them like a dark and menacing cloud, that their contracts will become the story.

World champions New Zealand could take extra motivation, believing England have become complacent

Newcastle United’s Alan Pardew, who was awarded an eight-year contract by Mike Ashley, is feeling the weight of this decision now.

If England lose two of the autumn internationals, if they fail to win the 2015 Six Nations, will the length of Lancaster’s contract become a similar weight?

What if England don’t get out of what is a really tough World Cup group?

I hope I am wrong about the RFU’s hasty announcement. I want nothing more than for Lancaster’s England to win the World Cup next year. Then we can debate whether he should keep going until 2019 or to move upstairs and let Farrell take over.

But I fear Wednesday may have weakened England, even by the tiniest amount.

International rugby is not a cosy environment. To get to the very top, a team needs to have an edge about them.

England need an amazing intensity and a real fear factor for the next 12 months. They don’t need to be thinking about Japan in 2019.
