More than £10million worth of red wine has been found in a derelict house in China.

A staggering 10,000 bottles of the tipple, Chateau Lafite Rothschild, were discovered by police at an abandoned house in Wenzhou, Zhejiang Province.

Police are yet to determine whether the wine - one of the most expensive reds in the world - is fake or genuine, but if they are the real the haul could be worth up to £10million.

Mystery: The home's owner told police his house has been empty for nine years and he knew nothing about the potentially valuable find

Haul: Police are yet to determine whether the wine - one of the most expensive reds in the world - is fake or genuine

The owner of the large house told 
police it had been empty for nine years and that he knew nothing about 
the potentially valuable find.

However, as there are only 50,000 
bottles of genuine Chateau Lafite Rothschild imported into China each 
year, police believe it may be a fake stash.

They are now searching for the illicit workshop where it may have been produced.

As of March, the estate which makes 
Chateau Lafite Rothschild has won six lawsuits against Chinese companies
over fake wine and was awarded at least £80,000 in compensation.

The wine estate in France has been owned by members of the Rothschild family since the 19th century.

Cases of Chateau Lafite Rothschild 
are extremely popular with collectors.

Single bottles cost between £700 
to more than £1,000 depending on their year.

In 2010 three bottles of 1869 Lafite Rothschild became the world’s most expensive wine after fetching a record £147,020 at a  Sotheby’s auction in Hong Kong.
