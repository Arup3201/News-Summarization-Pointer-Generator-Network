This is the hilarious moment a polar bear cub belly flopped into icy water in a failed attempt to catch its lunch.

Instead of diving gracefully, the two-year-old was seen suspended in mid-air before face-planting  with such force that his prey was scared into hiding.

He then clambered back onto the ice in Kaktovik, Alaska, looking a little soggy before sulking away from the camera.

Wildlife photographer, Michael D. Stern, 70, watched the youngster skid around on the ice before suddenly deciding to go for a dip.

'The cub was in a very playful mood when it jumped head first into the water,' he said.

'The ice was very slippy and it looked a little off balance on the run up to the edge.

'The bear had been happily playing on its own when it decided it wanted to go for a swim.

'It tried its best to dive into the water but instead it just belly flopped straight into the icy water.

'I was in Kaktovik for an intensive photography expedition when I saw the hilarious moment and I spent approximately 8 to 10 hours a day on the ice.

'They are a beautiful animal species and while looking somewhat harmless they are very powerful and very dangerous.'

Known for their incredible ability to swim across huge expanses of open water, the powerful animals can swim over 100 miles without stopping.

Polar bears are the largest land carnivores in the world, rivaled only by the Kodiak brown bears of southwestern Alaska.

They spend much of their time on Arctic sea ice, so their fur is thicker than any other bears' and covers even their feet for warmth and traction on ice. 

A thick layer of blubber beneath their fur provides buoyancy and insulation. 

The long neck and narrow skull of the polar bear probably aid in streamlining the animal in the water while warming the air that they breathe, and their front feet are large, flat and oar-like, making them excellent swimmers.

Polar bears feed almost exclusively on ringed seals and bearded seals. They are also known to eat walrus,beluga whale and bowhead whale carcasses, birds' eggs, and (rarely) vegetation.

The World Conservation Union (IUCN) estimates that there are between 20,000 to 25,000 polar bears in the world.
