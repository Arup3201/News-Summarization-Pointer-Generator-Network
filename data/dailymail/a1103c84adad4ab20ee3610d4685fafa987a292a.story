'Well handled': Pupils at King Edward VI Grammar School, Chelmsford, Essex, are exclusively male until sixth form when it becomes mixed

A male teacher at one of Britain's top grammar schools is returning to the classroom as a woman after undergoing gender surgery.

Teachers at King Edward VI Grammar School in Chelmsford, Essex, held a special assembly to inform pupils that the schoolmaster is having the operation and plans to return next term.

Tom Sherrington, who has been headmaster since 2008, also sent a letter to parents of the 860 pupils - explaining the procedure.

He wrote that the teacher, who has so far not been named, has throughout his life struggled with his gender identity.

'He is undergoing the process of gender reassignment,' he said.

Mr
Sherrington said the teacher had been allowed to give up work for the 
rest of the term so that he can begin planning for his new life.

He
would be returning to the school when the new term starts in September 
with his new name and will be referred to in future as 'Ms.'

He added: 'I would like to acknowledge the teacher’s courage in deciding to go through the transition process.'

The
school issued an official statement which said : 'King Edward VI 
Grammar School is proud of its commitment to equality and diversity 
among its staff and students.

'We
support them all. We treat them with respect and have due regard for 
their well-being and privacy at all times, regardless of their age, 
disability, gender, gender reassignment, ethnicity, religion or sexual 
orientation.'

Former pupils at the school, founded in 1551, include former Conservative cabinet minister Lord Norman Fowler, the former Conservative Opposition leader of the Welsh Assembly Nick Bourne and artist Grayson Perry.

One sixth former told a local newspaper in Essex: 'The whole thing was incredibly well handled.

'Our head of year read from a script and told us that the teacher was going to have gender reassignment surgery and will return in September as a Ms.'

The sixth former added: 'She is really popular and massively eccentric and I must say one of my favourite teachers.'

The teacher involved is understood to teach history.

The school takes pupils from 11 to 18. From Year seven to 11, the pupils are exclusively male, although it becomes mixed in the sixth form (years 12 and 13).

The school’s motto is 'Quicquid agas sapiens age fortiter ex animoque', which means ' Whatsoever thy hand findeth to do, do it with thy might.'
