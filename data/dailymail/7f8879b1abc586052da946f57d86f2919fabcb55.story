In 1938, London stockbroker Nicholas Winton decided to use his two weeks vacation to get to work.

As violence began escalating against Jewish people in Europe, the 29-year-old traveled to Prague and ended up saving the lives of 669 children, mostly Jews, from almost certain death.

Winton - now 104 - has spoken to CBS' 60 Minutes about his incredible story, which included theft, forging documents and even blackmailing officials to get his way.

'It worked, that's the man thing,' he said, grinning.

Some of the children saved by Winton have also come forward to reveal they did not know that this humble man was responsible for rescuing them until five decades after.

Heroic: Nicholas Winton, a former stockbroker from London, spent his 2 weeks vacation in 1938 saving hundreds of Jewish Czech children by organizing for them to be sent to England

As the Nazis marched into Czechoslovakia, Winton - who had no experience or connections in this sort of work - decided that he would travel to Prague to see if he could save people.

He had actually booked a vacation to go skiing in Switzerland, but changed his plans at the last minute when a friend involved in Jewish refugee work asked him for help.

'All I knew was that the people that I met couldn't get out,' Winton, who was born to German Jewish parents in London, told CBS' 60 Minutes in a special interview.

'And they were looking of ways of at least getting their children out... I work on the motto that if something's not impossible, there must be a way of doing it.'

Unassuming: Winton was 29 when he went to Prague and made a list of children to be saved

He set up shop in the city and people soon started coming to him, forcing him to work late into the night, historian David Silberklang told CBS.

When he returned to London, he had lists of hundreds of children and got to task convincing the British authorities to take them.

He pretended to be more official than he was by taking stationery from an established refugee organization, adding 'Children's Section' to its header and making himself chairman, CBS reported.

He admitted it took 'a little smoke and mirrors' to convince authorities to believe him - but he said it mostly took getting a printing press to print the paper.

He continued his work as a stockbroker by day, before returning to the office to work on getting the children to the UK. His mother and volunteers also helped at the office.

He said he contacted American authorities to take the children, but they said they were unable.

But British authorities said they would take them if Winton found each one a home, so he got to work advertising their pictures so that families would take them.

When he had secured them homes, the youngsters were ready to leave - but he found that the British authorities were slow to issue their travel documents.

Plot: He had no experience in such matters so when he got back to the UK, he got a printing press and forged headed paper saying he worked for the Children's Sections of the Committee for Refugees

Rescuer: Winton, pictured in Prague in 1938 with a young boy, kept his involvement quiet for 50 years

Desperate to help the children get out, he forged their documents and also paid off officials, he said.

'Took a bit of blackmail on my part,' he admitted. 'It worked. That's the main thing.'

The first children left Prague on March 14, 1939 - just hours before German troops occupied Prague.

Eventually, seven trains carried more than 600 children to Holland, where they caught ferries to England. The Nazis allowed them to leave, happy that the country was being 'cleansed' of Jews.

Another train was scheduled to leave on September 1, but was stopped by the declaration of war.

Winton said he has reason to suspect not many of those children survived.

One of the children who did escape, Hugo Meisl, recounted the moment he was put on a train by his parents.

Saved: Among the children saved were 14-year-old Alice Eberstark, left, and 10-year-old Hugo Meisl, right

Thankful: Alice, who now lives in Bethesda, Maryland, said she only heard Winton's name after 50 years

Survivor: Meisl said he was always hopeful that he would return home and find his parents

'I remember that they told us that we were going to England maybe two or three months,' he said. 'It would be a holiday for us. And that they would join us very shortly thereafter...'

But his parents never came for him, and their names are now painted on the walls of Prague's Pinkas Synagogue, where every Czech Jew who was murdered in the Holocaust is remembered.

Also among the children was 14-year-old Alice Eberstark, now 88 and living in Bethesda, Maryland.

She recounted her mother handing her items, including a delicate, embroidered nightgown, to take on the train when she left for England. She never saw her parents again.

'Many survivors feel guilty for having 
survived - I feel very grateful to my parents,' she said. 'Our parents' courage, I think, is the most 
important because most people said, "We will go together or not at 
all".'

After the war, Winton trained pilots for 
the Royal Air Force, married, raised a family and lived comfortably. He 
cared for mentally handicapped people and built homes for the elderly.

But he hardly told anyone about what he had done.

'I didn't really keep it secret,' he told CBS. 'I just didn't talk about it.'

But in 1988, his wife Grete found a scrapbook in their attic listing the names of the children, their parents and the families that had taken them.

Later that year, the BBC learned about the story and he went on a show, where he met scores of the children he had saved.

In 2002, he was knighted, and he was also celebrated in a documentary called 'Nicky's Family'. Next month, his daughter is releasing a book about her father.

But he doesn't care for the attention.

'I'm not interested in the past,' he said. 'I think there's too much emphasis nowadays on the past and what has happened. And nobody is concentrated on the present and the future.'
