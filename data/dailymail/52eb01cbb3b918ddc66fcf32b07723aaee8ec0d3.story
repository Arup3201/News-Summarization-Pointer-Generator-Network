So, is this how the Formula One cars of the future will look?

Ferrari have released images of a ‘concept’ design, a cross between their 2015 challenger and a supercar.

They have called on their fans to voice their opinion, and, despite its seemingly radical nature compared to today's cars, the Maranello marque insist few changes to the current regulations would be required for F1 to venture down such a route.

With the sport looking to make changes for the future, and with ideas up for discussion at an F1 Commission meeting in Geneva on Tuesday, Ferrari have unveiled their own idea as to how an F1 car should look

Explaining the release of the pictures, Ferrari said via their website: ‘Would it be possible to come up with an F1 car which not only is technologically advanced, but also captivating to the eye and aggressive-looking? And could this be made without having to overturn the current technical rules? 

‘At Ferrari, we believe so. Let us introduce you to the ‘concept design’ that was conceived by our design studio together with the Scuderia’s aero department.

‘Minimal changes give the car a look that is way different from what have been familiar with so far.

‘Our challenge was to create something that was – to put it short – better looking.’

Ferrari’s aggressive design comes on the day the Formula One Commission is considering aesthetic changes to the cars for the 2016 campaign and beyond.

Wider cars and tyres have been agreed on in principle, but a date is yet to be settled on.

Red Bull are keen to bring in changes for the 2016 campaign, with last year’s pacesetters Mercedes prepared to wait until a year later.
