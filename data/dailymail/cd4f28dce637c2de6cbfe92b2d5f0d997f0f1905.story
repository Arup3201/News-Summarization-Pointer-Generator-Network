Animal control officers are hunting for kittens believed to be infected with rabies that were given away in a supermarket car park.

Cat-lovers in Georgia, U.S., may have unwittingly adopted a kitten infected with the deadly disease after two women were spotted handing out six of the animals outside a Walmart in Henry County.

One of the kittens was found to be rabid
when it was brought to a vet after scratching its new owner then 
becoming lethargic - a symptom of the virus.

Officers from Henry County Animal 
Control - who are now urgently trying to locate the other kittens - 
warned it was 'highly likely' the remaining five were also carrying the 
infectious disease, which can be passed to humans through an animal bite
or scratch.

Rabies 
Control Officer Vince Farah told Georgia's Channel 2 News it was vital 
that anybody who had come into contact with the kittens be identified.

'If one kitten was positive it's highly likely the others are positive for rabies as well,' he said.

Officials believe the kittens' mother may have contracted rabies while it was pregnant and passed it on to the litter.

A man who brought one of the kittens 
home took it to a 24-hour veterinary clinic after it scratched his wife 
and then began acting lethargic.

The
animal was put down because the vet did not believe it would survive a 
10 day quarantine. Its remains tested positive for rabies.

The owner had accepted the kitten from two women outside the McDonough Walmart on August 25.

It
is not known whether the women, who were captured on CCTV camera giving
away six of the animals, were aware that one or more of the kittens 
were rabid.

The supermarket said it had been unaware of what the women were doing.

Mr Farah said: 'We do not know who handled these kittens. We don't know who the women were giving the kittens away.

'It's urgent that those who came in contact with the cats be identified because rabies is life-threatening.

'If gone untreated, death. That's the bottom line,' he said.

If an animal infected with rabies bites or scratches a human, the virus can spread to the brain through the nervous system.

Once the symptoms of rabies - which include fever and hallucinations - have developed, the condition is almost always fatal.
