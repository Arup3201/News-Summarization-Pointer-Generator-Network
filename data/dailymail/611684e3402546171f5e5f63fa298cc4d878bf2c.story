A father who went on the run with his son two weeks ago during a custody battle has posted a YouTube video in which the eight-year-old apparently makes damning comments about his mother.

Maurizio Rigamonti and his son Leo went missing from the central Italian city of Parma on January 3. On Wednesday a video appeared of the two together in which Leo says his mother forced him to 'say bad things' about his father.

Rigatoni introduces the footage as 'Leo's spontaneous statements', after which the boy says: 'You may think that my dad is bad, but itâ€™s the opposite, my mum is bad.'

After being prompted several times by Rigamonti, Leo adds that during a recent court appearance his mother 'threatened me to say tons of bad things about my dad.'

Authorities began a Europe-wide search for the father and his son two 
weeks ago after the boy's mother, Laura Carder went to collect her son but found the pair 
missing, according to La Repubblica.

On January 9 the boy's grandfather claimed the pair had gone to Trentino, in northern Italy, for a skiing holiday, though Carder believes Rigamonti may have fled to Spain.

Carder, an American, has previously claimed the boy suffered years of domestic abuse at the hands of his father and has since had to undergo therapy.

During court battles Carder has claimed that Rigamonti abused the boy, who had to be given therapy

The latest disappearance and video come as part of a four year custody battle in which a judge ruled the boy must stay in Italy with Rigamonti, where he was born.

Carder launched an unsuccessful appeal against the ruling, and has since used an online petition and a website in order to try and keep her son in the US.

When asked about his therapist by his father, Leo tells YouTube viewers: 'She is stupid, she threatens me to say things as well - bad [things] about my dad. I hate her'.
