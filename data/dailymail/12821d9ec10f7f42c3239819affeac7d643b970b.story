A pet dog left savaged by thugs is learning to walk again with three false legs after a groundbreaking operation.

Glory, a four-year-old cross-breed, needed a triple amputation following an attack in its native Romania. 

Proud owner Vanessa Bamkin, from Carlisle, Cumbria, adopted Glory after learning of her plight on an animal charity website.

The pet had been living as a stray in the town of Bacau, which sits 200 miles west of the Black Sea. A local factory worker took pity on her and cared for her.

But when he went away for a week, in April, the little dog was attacked by a gang of thugs.

The damage to her limbs was so extensive that both her front legs and one of her back paws had to be amputated.

Workers at the animal charity who saved Glory were so moved by her courage that they told her story on their website. And 2,000 miles away, in Carlisle, Cumbria, Vanessa and Roger vowed to help.

The big-hearted couple paid for her to be vaccinated then travelled to Romania to collect her.

They did some fundraising on the internet and were astonished when £4,000 poured in - enabling them to buy Glory's new legs from Gloucester firm Orthopets.

Vanessa said: 'She's such a brave little dog. The first time she put them on she was very wobbly, but she did really well and walked a bit.

'She's wearing her new legs three times a day for a few minutes at a time. She seems very happy with them."

'But we can't wait to give Glory a new lease of life. It will all be worth it.'

Rod Hunt, technical director of OrthoPets Europe, which is producing the limbs, said: 'It will not be a case of putting three new legs on Glory and then she will just run off into the sunset - it's a long-term project.

'We have never heard of a triple prosthesis in Europe so it's going to be a case of watch this space and see how she does.'

Once Glory has her new limbs fitted, the experts at OrthoPets will watch videos of her taken by Vanessa and make any adaptations to limbs which might be needed.

Mr Hunt said: 'She might walk like Pingu at first, but she will be dealing with three new limbs.

'Once she gets used to them, they'll give her a new lease of life.'

Who's a lucky boy? Roger and Vanessa paid £4,000 for Glory's groundbreaking treatment. It is believed to be the first time a dog has had three false legs fitted in Europe
