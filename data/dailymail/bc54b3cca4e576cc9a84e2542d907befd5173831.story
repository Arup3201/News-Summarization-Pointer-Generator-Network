These candid photos reveal what life is like in a poverty-stricken village in Cuba – and how much the Caribbean island’s rural communities could benefit from an influx of American tourists.

Thawing relations between the US and Cuban governments could open isolated communities to new economic opportunities once the US fully lifts its ban on trade and travel.

It’s in villages such as Gabriel where visitors can experience a side of the Caribbean island that few holidaymakers bother to see.

Cuba's rural communities, where there are few jobs, could benefit the most from thawing relations between the US and Cuban governments

Like in Havana, posters or paintings of revolutionary hero Che Guevara are visible everywhere in the village of Gabriel

In Gabriel, there are very few cars, workers harvest tomatoes by hand, farmers sell produce and meat at roadside stands, goods are transported by horse and buggy or tractor, and – just like in the capital of Havana – posters or paintings of revolutionary hero Che Guevara are visible everywhere.

While life goes on as normal in 'the real Cuba', talks continue to take place between US and Cuban officials to restore full diplomatic relations and move towards opening trade.

The old Cold War foes are claiming progress after a second round of discussions to end a half-century diplomatic freeze.

Presidents Barack Obama and Raul Castro have promised to restore embassies in each other’s capitals, although a few hurdles remain, including Cuba’s place on the US state sponsor of terrorism blacklist.

It is likely that with economic sanctions lifted, Cuba will change forever, and there are fears it will lose some of its unique identity

The US is planning to ease travel and trade restrictions with Cuba, a former Cold War foe, after agreeing to restore ties severed since 1961

While most US tourists will likely stick to Havana or all-inclusive resorts on the sea once the ban on travel is lifted, rural villages who do welcome foreigners are not prepared to handle them in large numbers.

Many lack running water, suitable accommodation and modern facilities, including toilets.

With Cuba poised to open itself up to a massive market for holidaymakers, tourists from outside the US are being warned that if they want to see 'the real Cuba' they should book their trips now, before the Caribbean country becomes 'Americanised'.

With many issues unresolved, the US is hoping to reach agreement on reopening embassies in time for a regional summit in Panama in April

Some travel experts are encouraging tourists to visit Cuba sooner rather than later if they want to see unadulterated local culture

The number of tourists visiting Havana has seen a steady increase following the normalisation of Cuba-US relations last year

While the landmark thaw in relations signals a positive future for Cuba, travellers looking to explore the 'timewarp' nation are being urged to go before it changes forever.

TravelSupermarket travel expert Bob Atkinson recently told MailOnline Travel: 'It really is a unique place to visit, and once it becomes fully open to the Americans, they will without doubt pile in.

'Havana was seen as a party destination for Americans years ago, such was its close proximity to Florida.

Presidents Barack Obama and Raul Castro have promised to restore embassies in each other’s capitals, although a few hurdles remain

One of the biggest hurdles is Cuba's place on a US list of state sponsors of terrorism, from which Cuba is pushing to be removed

If the US lifts its restrictions on travel and trade, one of the biggest draws for American tourists could be Major League Baseball games

'However you look at it, opening up to the Americans will change the way it feels and I think this will be to the detriment to the culture and heritage of the place.

If restrictions are lifted and Cuba becomes a popular destination for US tourists once again, one of the biggest draws could be the countries’ shared love of baseball.

Major League Baseball is considering playing spring exhibition games on the baseball-mad island nation, where American teams played before Fidel Castro came to power.

Major league teams regularly held spring training camps in Cuba in the 1940s and ‘50s, and there have been discussions to bring them back to the country once the governments officially end the diplomatic freeze.
