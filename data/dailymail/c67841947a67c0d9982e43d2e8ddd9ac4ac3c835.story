'Dog killer': Baltimore police officer Jeffrey Bulger, 49, was booked Wednesday on charges after slitting the throat of a dog in police custody

A policeman cut the throat of a dog that bit a woman despite a colleague having it under control, police said.

Baltimore Police Officer Jeffrey Bolger has been charged with animal cruelty, with officials saying there was no reason to kill the dog if it was already restrained.

The alleged attack happened on Saturday morning in Brewers Hill, a south-eastern district of the city, after police responded to a report of a woman being bitten.

Deputy Commissioner Dean Palmere said officers gained control of the animal, a seven-year-old Chinese Shar-Pei, with a dog pole and an officer used a knife to cut the dog's throat.

Late last night, Detective Jeremy Silbert issued a statement identifying that policeman as Bolger.

Announcing that internal affairs were investigating the killing, Mr Palmere called the incident 'outrageous and unacceptable'.

Witnesses told police that as Bolger got out of his vehicle, he said: 'I'm going to f****** gut this thing.'

He waited until colleagues got control of the dog before bending down and slashing its throat with a knife, witnesses said. It bled to death before animal control arrived, police told the Baltimore Sun.

The dog was initially thought to be a stray, but later was determined to have escaped from its home. Its owner says her pet, called Nala, was not vicious but just lost and scared.

'I never thought in a million years the police would show up and cut my dog’s throat,' Sarah Gossard told CBS Baltimore.

Miss Gossard had posted pictures of Nala online after the dog had gone missing. It is understood that the woman who was bitten had been trying to read the dogs tags, which were engraved with an address and phone number.

'She went missing Saturday and after looking for her all day, I found out through a neighbour that she was put down,' Miss Gossard told CNN.

'Police never contacted me until today. Only after did I find out more details. I learned from the news that she was stabbed in the throat. I want justice.'

Shar-Pei's are a fighting breed originally used as palace guards in China. The protective and loyal dogs take well to training and are easily socialised but can be stubborn. Largely silent, they only bark when playing or worried.

Bolger, who has been on the force since 1992, has been suspended without pay. Police are investigating why Bolger's colleagues didn't report the incident until Monday - two days later.

Deputy Commissioner Jerry Rodriguez told a news conference: 'We have no words to describe this. To say that we’re appalled at the allegations I think is an understatement.'

Mr Palemere told reporters: 'This is an outrageous and unacceptable breach of our protocol. The BPD does not condone and will not condone such actions.'
