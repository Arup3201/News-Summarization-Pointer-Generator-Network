Snow has finally arrived in the Alps!

And with the heavy flakes comes some very good news for skiers: prices are also falling in 19 of the 21 top European resorts, according to a new survey.

According to the latest Post Office Travel Money Ski Resort Report, the more substantial the downfall, the larger the savings, with Soldeu in Andorra offering some of the best value.

With snow having finally arrived, some of the best value skiing can be found in Soldeu, Andorra (pictured)

The cost of a six-day ski vacation at Bansko tallies £261, while Slovenia's Kranjska Gora comes in at £300

Soldeu, which also benefited from early snow, currently comes in at just £331 for a six-day ski vacation, including rental equipment, lift passes, ski school, meals and drinks.

Andorra's top ski resort saw the biggest fall in price overall, according a new report compiled from resort research by ski-holiday operator Crystal Ski Holidays.

But the best value is offered in the Bulgarian resort of Bansko - charging just £261 for a six-day trip.

Other good value ski destinations - where both snow and prices have fallen - include some of Europe's most fashionable resorts such as Italy's Sestriere and Courchevel in France.

Prices have fallen 16 per cent in Courchevel (£503) and 13 per cent in Sestriere (£354), which makes it the best value resort in this category for the second year in a row.

But savings aren't to be found everywhere. In the Swiss resorts of Zermatt and Saas Fee, despite recent snowfalls, prices have risen substantially.

Not all resorts offer snowfall savings! Zermatt in Switzerland has increased by 16 per cent

Saas Fee is now 10 per cent pricier than it was a year ago and Zermatt, now the highest-priced overall resort in Europe, is a 16 per cent more expensive. 

The strength of the sterling has had a positive impact on prices for UK skiers in all European resorts, but another key factor has been local price falls.

Although the strength of sterling – currently worth over six per cent more year-on-year against the euro – has had a positive impact on prices for UK skiers in all the European resorts surveyed, another factor has been local price falls. 

The evidence suggests that the need to attract back skiers after the market contracted 3.6 per cent last season may have been a catalyst for price cuts in top resorts. 

The report found local price falls in 16 of the European resorts surveyed, helping to compound the benefit of a stronger UK pound. 

Switzerland is home to some of the most expensive ski resorts in the world, such as Saas Fee

In the Balkans, Bulgaria's Bansko remains the cheapest ski resort for the second year in a row

Andrew Brown of Post Office Travel Money said: 'Although skiing is still cheapest in Bulgaria and Slovenia, growing competition for business means there are great bargains to be struck in many of the most popular European resorts this season. 

'What's more, the continuing strength of sterling against the euro and other European currencies provides the added bonus of more pounds in their pockets for UK skiers.

'While it is great news that skiers can look forward to lower prices in most European ski resorts this season, it is still important for them to do their homework and check all the resort costs they will face. 

'Adding these to the package price before deciding on a ski destination will provide a more accurate picture of what their holiday is likely to cost them.'
