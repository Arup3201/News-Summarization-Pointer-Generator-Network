Michael van Gerwen is ready to avenge his previous two defeats by Terry Jenkins at Alexandra Palace on Monday, and insists he is a better player than his third-round opponent.

The reigning world champion has lost his last two matches against Jenkins, but is adamant he will win on Monday night if he can hit top gear.

The world No 1 said: ‘I know I’m a better player than him (Jenkins) when I play my own game and when I’m playing at 100 per cent I am going to beat him.

‘But there is a lot of work to do before you can get to that level and you need to concentrate very hard to do that.’

Van Gerwen has been unconvincing in his opening two wins against Joe Cullen and Sascha Stein and admitted to being more nervous this year having become the prize scalp for the rest of the field.

He said: ‘I’m a bit more nervous, but I feel really good. I know my top game is inside me and I know I’m going to show it in my next game.

‘He (Jenkins) is playing well and is into the tournament. I’m not playing my best game, but I’ve still won quite easily and that’s a good thing to know.’ 

Jenkins, meanwhile, almost hit a nine-dart finish in his second-round whitewash of Laurence Ryder and is confident he can cause an upset against the Dutchman.

‘Michael will be out to beat me as much as I will be out to beat him so it should be a good game,’ Jenkins said.

‘You can’t think about who you’re playing against, you’ve just got to go up there and concentrate on winning that game. You know what you’re doing in practice, get your practice right and make sure you’re on form all the time.’

Jenkins believes he is playing some of the best darts of his long career despite scaling down the number of tournaments he plays.

‘It’s my age – I’m getting too old,’ Jenkins laughed. ‘I get tired now.’

The 51-year-old added: ‘I’m more relaxed now. When you’re younger you can want it too much. You can over try and put too much practice in and want it too much. Then when you go up there you try too hard.

‘I’m not doing so much practice and when I do go up there I’m a lot keener.

‘Before I was doing a lot of practice and when you get up there I think you’re just tired. You’ve got to get your head right as much as your arm.

‘You can go up there and practice 10 hours a day and not be as good as somebody who practices two hours a day.

‘I still want to win, don’t get me wrong, but I think you learn to cope with it better when you get older and you don’t see many dart players coming through until their late 30s to early 40s and that’s when they start to shine.

‘There are a lot of young kids who are praised up but they fade out and don’t come back until they’re a little bit older.’

This year’s tournament at Alexandra Palace also sees a return for Jenkins’ famous moustache, which was shaved off by James Wade at a charity evening last year.

Jenkins explained: ‘When I had my haircut I always played a load of rubbish in a Players Championship. I think “I wonder if that took a bit of my strength”. I never have my haircut now before a competition.

‘Everybody kept asking where my tache had gone. I said “I’ll grow it back just for the World Championship”, but I’m shaving it straight off after.

‘Some people say they don’t like it, but you can’t please everybody.’
