Police were called to an elementary school in Pennsylvania after police found several packets of heroin in the boy’s first grade class on Friday.

According to court documents, Pauline Bilinski-Munion, 56, told police she ‘lost track’ of the heroin at her house while she was babysitting the boy and a one-year-old baby on Thursday.

She was taken into custody on Sunday after a teacher at Caln Elementary found the drugs on her grandson.

Grandmas stash: Pauline Bilinski-Munion, 56, is facing child-endangerment and drug charges after her 7-year-old grandson brought heroin to his elementary school, authorities said

Teachers spoke with the little boy and found nine bags in his pants pocket, officials said.

The heroin was stamped ‘Victoria Secret.’ The child initially claimed he’d found the drugs in the school yard, but later admitted he brought the drugs from home, police said.

The child told investigators that he found the heroin by a washing machine where his mother, father and grandmother live.

Bilinski-Munion admitted to investigators that she is an active heroin user, and told them that she found the drugs outside her home on Thursday, according to court documents.

The documents say the grandmother admitted that she didn't call authorities and instead kept the heroin 'in case of an emergency.'

The school told parents that a 'dangerous and illegal' substance was found in the grass and parents should check to see if their children had any.

Detectives then interviewed the boy with his relatives, at which time they learned he usually stays with his aunt in Coatesville, but recently had been living with his mother, father, and grandmother.

A search warrant was executed at the residence on Saturday evening, and detectives allegedly located heroin bags in the home, as well as an empty heroin bag in a pair of children's shorts.

Chester County District Attorney Tom Hogan is livid after learning about the heroin find through media reports.

'We’re lucky we don’t have a dead seven-year-old on our hands from ingesting heroin,' he told CBS News.

'The school district didn’t call 911. Didn’t call the DA’s office. Did not freeze all the kids in place. Did not call emergency personal to see if the kids were okay.'

The School District released the following statement:

'Caln Elementary School administrators contacted the Coatesville Area School District Police Department within minutes of discovering an unknown substance within the possession of one of its students.

The Coatesville Area School District Police Department immediately contacted Caln Township, Coatesville city and South Coatesville Police Departments.'

Bilinksi-Munion is being held at the Chester County Prison after failing to post her $25,000 cash bail.
