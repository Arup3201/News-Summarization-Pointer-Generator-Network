Fellow Republicans on 
Saturday debated the fallout over new allegations that Gov. Chris 
Christie made inaccurate statements about his knowledge of lane closures
 orchestrated by top aides as apparent political payback.

Some
 said the accusations could derail any hopes of Christie running for 
president in 2016 if he can't shake the scandal soon, while others were 
quick to express faith in the governor while discrediting his accuser 
and questioning his motives.

A letter released
 Friday by a lawyer for a former Christie loyalist who ordered the 
closures on the heavily traveled George Washington Bridge said evidence 
exists suggesting the governor knew about the closings as they happened 
in September, which would contradict Christie's previous assertions.

Governor Chris Christie will need to prove he didn't know about the lane closings if he wants to run for president

The
 governor's office has denied the claims by David Wildstein, a former 
executive with the Port Authority of New York and New Jersey who was 
among four people who lost their jobs in the scandal.

Reaction
 among top Republicans on Saturday appeared mixed, with most believing 
he could weather the storm but acknowledging the latest allegations 
hurt.

'It's not good for him,' said Matt 
Beynon, a Republican operative who worked on former Sen. Rick Santorum's
 2012 presidential campaign and still has him as a client. 'The longer 
the story goes on, the worse it gets for him. If this is still an issue a
 year from now, he's going to have trouble pulling the trigger. ... Gov.
 Christie will have to think long and hard about running.'

But Ken Langone, a co-founder of Atlanta-based Home Depot Inc. and a staunch Christie supporter, expressed no such reservations.

'I
 have complete faith and trust that the governor is telling the truth, 
and I continue to believe that he would be a superb president if he were
 elected in the future,' Langone said.

David Wildstein, former Port Authority of New York and New Jersey Director of Interstate Capital Projects and an ally of New Jersey Governor Chris Christie, said Christie knew about the lane closures

Matt 
Mackowiak, a Texas-based Republican consultant, agreed that Christie's 
chances on a national stage won't be harmed so long as he has been 
honest about what he knew.

'As long as he was 
telling the truth, he is fine,' Mackowiak said. 'But if he knew about 
this, it brings him in directly and adds - potentially - dishonesty to 
the charges.'

Christie, who has kept mostly to
 the sidelines during the run-up to this year's Super Bowl, which his 
state his hosting, received a smattering of boos and some cheers during a
 pre-game ceremony in New York on Saturday. He didn't appear affected by
 the crowd's reaction during the Times Square ceremony.

As
 the new head of the Republican Governors Association, Christie's 
priority this year is raising money for the party's gubernatorial 
candidates around the country. Republicans maintain that donors are 
staying loyal to Christie so far.

'My donors 
are saying they believe what Gov. Christie is saying. They're giving him
 a lot of rope,' said Ray Washburne, who leads the Republican National 
Committee's fundraising effort.

Gov. Chris Christie made inaccurate statements during a news conference about the lane closures near the George Washington Bridge, according to a letter released Friday

'He's not 
raising money for himself,' Beynon added. 'If you're a donor in 
Cleveland, you're thinking about (Ohio Gov.) John Kasich and not Chris 
Christie.'

The head of the state legislative 
panel looking into the traffic jams said Wildstein's new allegations 
validate the skepticism committee members have expressed throughout the 
probe, an investigation Christie once referred to as the Democrats' 
obsession and some state Republicans have called 'a witch hunt.'

Assemblyman
 John Wisniewski, a Democrat, said he doesn't know what evidence 
Wildstein may have but said it could be an email or document that fell 
beyond the date range called for in the original subpoena.

Wildstein
 is among 20 people and organizations close to Christie who must comply 
with a new round of subpoenas by Monday, though Wisniewski said almost 
all the recipients have requested more time.

When
 Wildstein, a former political blogger who has known Christie since high
 school, appeared before the legislative panel, he asserted his right 
against self-incrimination and refused to answer any questions. His 
lawyer, Alan Zegas, has said Wildstein would testify if granted immunity
 from prosecution.

Wildstein has been 
identified as the person who ordered the lane closings. He resigned from
 a $150,000-per-year job that he got with Christie's blessing because of
 the scandal.

'Any time you have disgruntled 
employees leave an operation you always wonder what's going to happen," 
Mackowiak said. 'You could see this coming. Their lives have changed 
forever.'
