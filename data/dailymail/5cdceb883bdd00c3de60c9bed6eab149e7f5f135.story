Admittance: Child killer Ian Brady, murdered another four people

Letters emerged last night in which Ian Brady reveals the details of four more murders he claims to have committed.

In the handwritten letters, the Moors Murderer said he killed two men in his hometown of Glasgow and a man and a woman in Manchester.

He also claims the body of missing Keith Bennett is buried in Yorkshire, and not on Saddleworth Moor, near Manchester, where painstaking searches have taken place over many years.

The previously unseen letters emerged as Brady was told he must remain in a mental hospital indefinitely after his request to return to prison was refused.

A mental health tribunal yesterday concluded the child killer’s mental disorder was severe enough to justify his ongoing treatment at Ashworth high-security hospital.

Brady, who was convicted of the murders of five children aged between ten and 17, has made several claims over the years that he killed more victims.

In 1987 he wrote to the BBC claiming he had killed five more people.

Four of these he confessed to killing in the latest letters, which he had written to Brendan Pittaway, a former journalist he was in contact with while in Ashworth Hospital.

Brady describes the four murders as ‘happenings’ and claims he killed a man on ‘waste ground behind the station’, a ‘woman’ in a ‘canal’, a man in Glasgow and another man ‘above Loch Long’, a picturesque sea loch at the mouth of the Clyde.

He also gave details of the four alleged murders to Detective Chief Superintendent Peter Topping, who led the search for Keith when Brady confessed to killing him in 1985.

The claims were discussed in Mr Topping’s 1989 autobiography, in addition to an 18-year-old youth Brady claimed to have killed and buried on the moors. 

But the detective said he had serious doubts about whether Brady was telling the truth, and even the killer himself had suggested some of his claims might be ‘figments of his imagination’.

According to Brady, Mr Topping told him a ‘mentally retarded man’ had confessed to the killing near the station but was never charged, and the woman found in the canal had been classed as a suicide despite ‘the absence of a suicide note and the presence of a bruise on her head’.

He alleges the detective told him records at Strathclyde Police did not go back as far as the death of one of the men in Glasgow and the second did not match any reports of missing persons.

Brady also claims he gave Mr Topping ‘names, places and methods used’.

He writes: ‘My statements were an embarrassment to the police, who, rather than admit irregularities had taken place, will move mountains to cover up.’

In the same letter, dated November 24, 1989, he writes: ‘As for Keith Bennett. The area of the site is in Yorkshire, not [double underlined] Lancashire, and should have been dealt with by the Yorkshire Police.

‘I have already stated my readiness to questioning under Sodium Penthatol [sic] so-called ‘truth drug’, but not [double underlined] by the Manchester Police.’

It is unclear if Brady's claim that 
Keith's body is buried in 'Yorkshire, not Lancashire' is in reference to
his disagreement with boundary changes, and does not mean Greater 
Manchester Police, who he has a grudge against, have been searching in 
the wrong area.

Last night it emerged the mental health tribunal process could be repeated almost immediately because Brady has the right to ask the authorities to review his detention every 12 months.

Victim: Keith Bennett, 12, was snatched and murdered in 1964

The tribunal was delayed from last year due to Brady’s ill health, meaning he could ask for another hearing later this year.

Under the Mental Health Act, Brady also has the right to challenge yesterday’s decision, which would require a further hearing at an Upper Tribunal.

The victims’ families last night branded the tribunal system ‘a farce’ and ‘circus’.

Terry Kilbride, 59, whose brother John was killed aged 12 in 1963, said: ‘That he should be allowed to have another tribunal with the huge cost and heartache it has caused is a total farce.

'He uses the system as a plaything. It really does beggar belief.’

In the tribunal, estimated to have cost the taxpayer £250,000, Brady argued he merely suffered from a personality disorder which should not preclude him being returned to a normal prison.

The 75-year-old painted himself as a victim, saying the conditions at the hospital in Merseyside were the ‘catalyst’ for his 13-year hunger strike – although the hearing was told he regularly enjoyed cups of soup and toast.

He denied eating in secret and refused to say whether he would try to starve himself to death if he was transferred from hospital to a prison.

Martin Bottomley, Head of Greater 
Manchester Police's Cold Case Review Unit, said: 'In the 1980s, Brady 
"confessed" to a number of other unrelated murders.

'All these claims were thoroughly investigated at that time and found to be completely unsubstantiated.

'A week hardly goes by when we do not receive some information which purports to lead us to Keith's burial site.

'All of these claims are investigated and it remains our aim to find Keith for the sake of his surviving family members.

'Only one person knows where Keith is buried and he refuses to disclose 
that information, preferring to taunt Keith's loved ones, assisted by 
those who seek to profit from his manipulative scheming.'

He added that the police force has seen similar correspondence between 
Brady and his confidantes and advisers, who 'have similar plans to 
capitalise on his notoriety after his death'.

A Police Scotland spokesman said: ‘We have no ongoing inquiries into Ian Brady.’
