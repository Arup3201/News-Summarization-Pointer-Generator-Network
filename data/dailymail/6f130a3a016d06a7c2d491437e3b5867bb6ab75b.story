It takes a high level of fitness as well as a great deal of focus and dedication to achieve a black belt in taekwondo.

So you would think that doing it while pregnant would be out of the question.

But one single mother proved that she had what it took to become one of the few women to gain a fourth degree taekwondo black belt when she was eight months pregnant with her first child.

Girl power: Katie Billingham trained for her fourth degree taekwondo black belt up until she was eight months pregnant

Katie Billingham, 29, put herself through a gruelling four-year schedule before gaining the qualification on October 25 this year.

She said:  ‘It's such a long training period.

‘When I fell pregnant I just thought I will do what I can and keep going until the time comes when I have to stop.

‘I styled my training back as it got nearer because sparring would have been silly.

‘But you can lower the intensity and still get a lot out of it. And exercise during pregnancy is always very important anyway.'

Dedication: The single mother only stopped training when she 'was wobbling up and down' but continued teaching up until she went into labour

The former carnival queen fell pregnant with first son Leo, now two-years-old, midway through the training but remarkably, continued with her programme.

And she only stopped fighting in December 2010 when she was eight months pregnant, one month before she gave birth by emergency caesarean a month later.

She said: ‘I got together with my instructor for a Christmas meal and I decided I had to throw in the towel until I gave birth.

Back to it: The single mother started training again just months after her first child Leo was born by caesarian

‘I was wobbling up and down then. But I
continued teaching my classes until I went into labour, only calling to
cancel the class from the hospital bed.

The single mother revealed she started training again just months after her first child Leo was born and was back to her best within a year.

Miss Billingham, from Stourport in Worcestershire, added: ‘After giving birth I had to slowly ease myself into it. It was difficult because the whole mentality of taekwondo is to push yourself harder and harder.

Achievement: Miss Billingham pictured with a certificate for her fourth degree taekwondo black belt

‘I was back teaching after six weeks and it was a couple of months before I was training again.

‘I even didn't wear my black belt for
a while because I didn't feel I was at that standard.

'It took me a year
to get back and it was a difficult challenge but it was worth it.’

Miss
Billingham, who teaches taekwondo across the Midlands, gained the 
fourth degree, or dan, at an assessment day in Bristol with 640 other 
black belt holders this October.

Despite giving birth midway through her training, she recorded the fifth highest score at the event.

And the single mother, who is also a personal trainer and fitness instructor, revealed that slowing her training before she gave birth might have helped her.

Katie, who started taekwondo aged just 12 and gained her first black belt when she was a student ten years ago, added: ‘I think lowering the intensity helped enable me to perfect the positions.

‘I think it's done me a lot of good in terms of my skills.

‘There's not many females above fourth degree and one of the reasons for that is child birth.

‘A lot of women feel they are not the same after that so stop.

‘I meet a lot of mums who lose themselves a bit after having children and I would like them to know that the body is still capable of amazing things.

‘I've got five years until my next degree but I haven't got any plans to have another child at the moment.’

In taekwondo, a black belt is not the highest qualification, as further degrees can be given, depending on the amount of time spent training.

A ninth degree of black belt is the highest achievement but there is no known UK resident with that qualification.
