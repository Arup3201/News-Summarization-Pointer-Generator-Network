Had Charli Evans not suffered a stroke, the two-inch tumour in her brain would have remained undetected and could have killed her

A schoolgirl's life was saved when she suffered a stroke - because doctors discovered she had a deadly brain tumour.

Charli Evans, 15, had been in constant pain for two years and endured crippling headaches and completely lost her appetite.

Playground bullies teased her about her shrinking size and a dietitian said she was suffering from an eating disorder.

But despite repeated visits to her doctor and specialists, Charli's tumour was only detected after she suffered a stroke and collapsed at home.

Doctors told her parents Carol and Andrew, 43, that if she hadn't suffered the attack, the two-inch tumour would have remained undetected and could have killed her.

Charli had an eight-and-a-half hour emergency operation to remove the growth - with no guarantee of survival - but is now on the road to recovery.

Charli's health problems started in October 2010 when she was just 13. She was taken to the family doctor near 
her home in Bonnyrigg, Midlothian, complaining of a loss of appetite and
a lack of energy and was diagnosed with glandular fever.

But her condition deteriorated and her weight dropped dramatically.

She was so tired that she was forced to give up playing football as training sessions became too much.

Before being diagnosed, Charli (with mother Carol) had been in constant pain for two years and endured crippling headaches and completely lost her appetite

It was only after a massive stroke that doctors found a rare brain tumour that had been growing for two years

Charli said: 'It was 
gradual. It started off with me not wanting to eat breakfast, then I 
wouldn't want to eat lunch and then I wouldn't want to eat anything on a
daily basis.

'I didn't want to do anything, I didn't 
want to go anywhere and I didn't want to see anyone. I didn't feel well 
enough to go out. It was horrible.

'I just got thinner and thinner. I used 
to get teased every day and I didn't want to get changed for P.E. 
because people looked at me funny.

'I was sick of people telling me that I had an eating disorder and that I had an issue with food.'

An MRI scan revealed a benign tumour two-inches 
wide growing upwards towards her skull. Charli had to undergo a 
gruelling eight-hour emergency operation to remove the tumour

The type of tumour Charli had - haemangioblastoma - usually forms on the kidneys or the liver, so doctors were baffled to find it on the brain

The real cause of Charli's condition 
only emerged after her stroke last September when an MRI scan revealed a
benign two-inch tumour growing upwards towards her skull.

She said: 'At the time, I just thought "15-year-olds don't have strokes". It was horrible, but it's the best thing that has ever happened to me.

'I can't really remember the stroke, but I remember being scared and shouting. I had pins and needles in my arm, then it spread to my leg, then my face, then I couldn't feel my tongue.

'When the doctor told me the worst possible scenario would be a brain tumour, I didn't take it in. I didn't think it was a possibility.'

It's thought that Charli's stroke was triggered by pressure from the tumour building up in her brain.

Around 4,300 benign tumours of the 
central nervous system are diagnosed each year in the UK but of these 
only two in 100 are haemangioblastomas.

Her mother Carol, 47, said: 'The type of tumour that Charli had - haemangioblastoma - was uncommon and usually forms on the kidneys or the liver, so doctors were baffled to find it on the brain. They'd never seen it there before.

Charli on the day of the brain tumour surgery (left); she is now on the road to recovery and said: 'Having a stroke was horrible, but it's the best thing that has ever happened to me'

'They told us that if it wasn't for the stroke then it wouldn't have been detected.

'It was a nightmare. You think that these things happen to somebody else, you never think that it could happen to you.'

She has since gained over two stone in weight, rediscovered her appetite and is attending school a few days per week.

Mrs Evans, a a security officer at Edinburgh University, said: 'People need to be aware that just because kids are young doesn't mean that they want to look like size-zero models.

'The stigma of kids not eating because they want to be thin and like models is not always the case.

'Looking back I feel relieved. As a mother I'm delighted that she is back with all her friends and doing what she has wanted to do for the past two years.

'Our life has changed as a family and we take every day as it comes. I know it can only get better now.'

Martin Ledwick, head information nurse 
at Cancer Research UK, said: 'It's important that any symptoms in 
children are taken seriously and any unexplained symptoms should be 
investigated if they persist.

'But the signs of brain tumours can be 
quite vague and hard to identify and most GPs and A&E departments 
will hardly ever see a case.'
