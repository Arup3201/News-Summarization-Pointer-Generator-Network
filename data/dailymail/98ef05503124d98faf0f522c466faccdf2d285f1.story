One of the world's rarest motorbikes once owned by Steve McQueen is expected to raise as much as $750,000 at auction next month.

The canary yellow 1915 Cyclone was among Hollywood star McQueen's extensive collection of classic motorbikes when he died from cancer in 1980 aged 50.

The Cyclone is one of the the most desirable motorbikes in the world due to its exclusivity - it was made for just three years between 1913 and 1916 and only six are known to exist today.

They were built for board track racing, a popular motorsport where riders would compete around a huge bank-sided oval circuit similar in shape to a velodrome.

The bikes, made without brakes, could hit record speeds of more than 110mph courtesy of a 996cc 45hp engine.

Cyclones were sold for just $350 - the equivalent to about $7,000 today.

But failures in various parts meant running costs were high and by 1916 the company behind them, the Joerns Motor Manufacturing Company, had folded.

Worth a fortune: The Cyclone bike is tipped to fetch a staggering $750,000 when it goes under the hammer at Mecum Auctions in Las Vegas

It is not known how long McQueen, an avid motorcycle fan, had owned the Cyclone for when he died.

He is best remembered for his role as Captain Virgil Hilts in the 1963 film The Great Escape, based on the story of an escape attempt from the Stalag Luft III POW camp in Poland.

The iconic final scene sees McQueen's character jump a barbed wire fence on a motorbike before being captured by Nazi guards.

The Cyclone bike is tipped to fetch a staggering $750,000  when it goes under the hammer at Mecum Auctions in Las Vegas.

That price would make it one of the most expensive motorbikes ever sold at auction.

The world record was set last year when the Harley Davidson from the film Easy Rider sold for $1.3million.

A spokesman for the auctioneers said: 'This combination of Steve McQueen and Cyclone is unique in the world - it is by far the most interesting motorcycle owned by the King of Cool.'

The motorcycle was bought by world renowned American collector EJ Cole at an auction of McQueen's bikes in 1984, four years after his death, then restored to its former glory.

Now 89 years old, Mr Cole has decided now is the right time to sell it off along with more than 220 vintage American motorbikes from his collection, which he has spent 50 years amassing.

Mr Cole said: 'If my age hadn't gotten ahead of me I'd still be out trying to add to my collection, but being that I'm 89 I feel like it's time to quit.

'Here at my place nobody gets to see them and they need to be out where people can enjoy them.'

The auction will be held in Las Vegas on March 20.

McQueen's old vehicles have a history of attracting fortunes at auction and several cars once owned or driven in movies by the star have raised millions of dollars.

In August last year, a British car collector spent £9million on a 1967 Ferrari because it was once owned by the actor.

The actor bought the Ferrari 275 GTB/4 while filming police drama Bullitt. In the film, his character Frank Bullitt is followed in his 1967 Ford Mustang Fastback by a black Dodge Charger in one of the best car chase scenes in Hollywood history.

McQueen insisted during filming that he would perform most of his own stunts, including the high-speed car chase.
