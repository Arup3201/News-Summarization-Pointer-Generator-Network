A businessman whose wooden flooring company buildings were devastated by 10ft-high floodwater says the poor weather caused £1million worth of damage.

Neil Craddock has run Wood Flooring Engineered, a specialist firm which has been based in Burrowbridge on the Somerset Levels for the past ten years.

But the factory has spent the whole of 2014 under up to 10ft of water, with the floods destroying the company's expensive equipment and stock.

Mr Craddock, 64, returned to the site for the first time since flood waters have receded today to find £250,000 of timber ruined, with total losses running up to £1 million as he was unable to insure the site following flooding the previous year.

'It was a mangled mess of wood, machinery and debris,' said the businessman.

'No one thought this would happen. The water was ten-foot deep in the factory, you can see the watermark. The place is a terrible mess.

Loss: Mr Craddock could not insure his business due to a previous flood

Clear up: Staff desperately try to remove the last of the water and debris from the workshop

Enduring: Despite the recent improvement in the weather, water still remains inside this workshop

Wreckage: Mr Craddock described his property as 'a mangled mess of wood, machinery and debris'

Value :Mr Craddock says the value of timber ruined is £250,000, while machinery is worth an additional £600,000 - with the money coming out of his own pocket

Recovery: Mr Craddock has rented a factory to get back to production and hopes to be able to salvage some of the equipment and materials from his warehouse

Stock: The jumble of flood-ruined wood inside Mr Craddock's workshop

'People talk about floods, but until you see the actual devastation you don't really understand.

'We've been numbed by the experience, it's unbelievable. I don't think anyone can really prepare for what's happened.

Mr Craddock says the value of timber ruined is £250,000, while machinery is worth an additional £600,000 - with the money coming out of his own pocket.

He added: 'The total loss is going to be around £1 million and we've got no insurance. After last year's floods we couldn't get cover.

'We haven't been able to do anything since Christmas, but we are open for business again and have a good order book. Our customers have been very sympathetic.

'We've rented a factory to get back to production. We might be able to salvage a bit, but it's a case of wait and see.'
