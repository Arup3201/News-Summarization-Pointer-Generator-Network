These pictures show more than 1,000 cyclists laying across a central London road in protest at dangerous traffic conditions.

Dubbed a 'die-in', protesters blocked roads outside the Transport for London headquarters in Southwark as part of a vigil for six cyclists killed in the capital this month.

The demonstration saw riders spread across Blackfriars Road with their bikes strewn around them, while others held candles in tribute to the latest spate of casualties.

Protest: Cyclists lay across a central London road as part of a mass 'die-in' outside Transport for London

'Die-in': Thousands attended the Stop Killing Cyclists protest - held as part of a vigil for six riders who have died in the city this month

Donnachadh McCarthy, 54, one of the organisers of the Stop Killing Cyclists protest, said the plan was inspired by riders in Holland, who used similar tactics to push for investment in safe transport infrastructure.

Beginning the 15-minute die-in, he said: 'We Londoners are going to join the Dutch, and follow them until we get our roads safe.

'So I respectfully ask you now, London cyclists and pedestrians and drivers who have come to join us today, to lie on the pavement with your bicycles, turn on your lights and let them flash in the memories of people killed and injured in the last eight years.

He added: 'We are here because Londoners are fed up of being killed. We need to have modern, European, safe cycling network. We believe it’s a human right for children and pensioners to cycle around our city safely, and at the moment they can’t. 

Action: The protestors, inspired by riders in Holland who used similar tactics to call for investment in transport, were calling for better safety measures on the roads

Calls: Participants were calling for £600million to be spent on safer cycling in London following scores of deaths on the roads

'We have brought the battle to TfL’s headquarters because these are the people making the decisions. We want representations and we want real funding. We want £600 million a year spent on safer cycling in London.

'We believe that we need a separate, segregated modern cycle network that is at least two metres wide. We can do that in London, there is plenty of space to do it.'

Six cyclists have been killed on the capital's roads in the past month.

Brian Holt, 62; Francis Golding, 69, Roger William De Klerk, 43, Venera Minakhmetova, 24, a 21-year-old man from St John’s Wood and a man believed to be in his 60s all died between November 5 and 18.

Scale: Protestors laid in the road with their cycles for around 15 minutes for the 'die-in'

The number of cyclists killed in London so far this year, 14, now stands equal to those who died in 2012.

Scene: A cyclist his 30s died in Gateshead

A cyclist died after colliding with a double-decker bus.  

The incident happened in Shipcote Lane, Gateshead, Tyne and Wear at 4.08am this morning.  

The cyclist, a man in his 30's, was taken to the Royal Victoria Infirmary in Newcastle where he was later pronounced dead.  

Police and paramedics attended the scene and the A167 Durham Road is closed between Shipcote Lane and the Five Bridges roundabout while enquiries are carried out. 

Leon Daniels, managing director of TfL Surface Transport, said one of the protesters’ key demands - segregated cycle routes - were to be introduced in the next 10 years.

He said: 'We are all shaken by the recent spate of deaths on the roads, and our sympathies are with all the friends and families of those affected. The protesters are rightly demanding safety should be at the top of our priorities. It is.

'That’s why we are investing nearly £1 billion in upgrading the existing superhighways with greater segregation, introducing major new segregated routes and backstreet quiet routes, and overhauling dozens of junctions to give more protection to cyclists.

He added: 'Delivering such major improvements will take time, but we are working flat-out to do so. We and the mayor have set out our plans and the first major improvements, such as the segregated extension of the Superhighway to Stratford, are now being seen.

'Over the forthcoming weeks and months Londoners will see many more improvements as the investment we are making bears fruit.'

The protest, organised in part by cycle activist group Critical Mass, follows a police operation that stationed hundreds of officers at busy junctions around central London.

Vigil: 14 cyclists have been killed on the London roads this year - equaling the number who died in 2012

Investment: TfL have said they are working flat-out to make improvements

Operation Safeway deployed 650 officers to 60 junctions during evening and morning rush hours on Monday, primarily targeting cyclists who breach the highway code.

London Mayor Boris Johnson said: 'This targeted operation has been hugely effective at raising awareness of road safety among motorists and cyclists.

'This is a balanced operation reminding everyone of their duty to take care of each other while out on the roads, and I hope the figures put to rest concerns by some groups that they are being singled out.'

On November 5, hospital porter Brian Holt, 62, died on Mile End Road in east London as he cycled along Cycle Superhighway 2. He was crushed by a tipper lorry as it moved off from stationary during the evening rush hour.

Architect Francis Golding, 69, crashed with a coach in Holborn, central London also on November 5. He died on November 8.

The following Tuesday, November 12, Roger de Klerk, 43, died after he was crushed by a single-decker bus outside East Croydon station in south London.

Cyclist: Venera Minakhmetova with her bicycle. She died on Wednesday November 13

Latest victim: Richard Muzira who died after being knocked from his bicycle by a lorry in Camberwell

The next day Venera Minakhmetova, a Russian entrepreneur died after being hit by a lorry at the notorious Bow roundabout on the Cycle Superhighway at rush hour.

That evening a 21-year-old man from St John's Wood was hit by a bus at 11.30pm in Aldgate, near the Cycle Superhighway 2. He died the following morning.

A cyclist in his early 60s died on November 18 after a collision with a lorry on Camberwell Road in South London. He was named the next day as Richard Muzira.
