Two teenage girls who were attacked with battery acid in Zanzibar should return to the country to help with the police investigation, detectives have said.

Kirstie Trup and Katie Gee were left badly injured after two men on a moped threw acid at them while they walked to dinner.

The two friends, who were volunteering on the Indian Ocean island of Zanzibar, are now back in the UK and will undergo skin grafts.

But it emerged today that police officers tracking the men on the tropical island may ask the girls to return to help convict any potential suspects.

Police have been given hope after the two friends said they would be able to identify their attackers if they saw them again. 

Mussa Ali Mussa, Zanzibar’s commissioner of police, said the girls could help with identification of suspects or any future trial.

Speaking to the Evening Standard, he 
said: 'It will depend on the circumstances of the investigation (but) 
yes, we shall ask them. We shall contact the UK authorities.'

Miss Gee, from Hampstead in London, 
suffered burns to 80 per cent of her right arm and 50 per cent of her 
torso. Miss Trup, from East Finchley, London, was less seriously injured
 after jumping into the sea to wash off the acid.

Miss
 Gee had an operation yesterday in the Chelsea & Westminster 
hospital while Miss Trup will return for a skin graft on Thursday.

The family of Katie have said they want her to recover from her injuries before they consider returning to Zanzibar.

Speaking to the Evening Standard, Doug Morris, boyfriend of Katie Gee’s mother Nicky, 45, said:  She is not in the condition to travel, and the family’s primary concern is her recovery.'

Katie's mother Nicky told this week how she was struggling to come to terms with why someone could do ‘something so evil’.

Mrs Gee told BBC News: ‘This whole thing is unexplained. It's difficult to think of someone doing something so evil. This is an extremely long journey. It's very, very sensitive.’

The pair were attacked by two men on a moped in Zanzibar City. They were flown to hospital in Dar es Salaam in mainland Tanzania, then on to London.

Zanzibar’s police have said a third British woman was sent threats apparently from the same attackers. The unnamed 29-year-old insisted she would not stop her charity work on the island.

Members of both teenagers' families have been keeping a bedside vigil after the pair were flown home and immediately sent to London's regional burns centre.

Katie has already taken to Twitter to thank well-wishers for their support, while a photograph released by the teenagers' families showed the injuries one of them suffered in the attack.

The women were enjoying the last week of a trip as volunteer teachers to the predominantly Muslim island when the corrosive substance was thrown at them in an apparently unprovoked attack.

They had originally planned to return in time to collect their A-level results this week, with Kirstie hoping to study history at the University of Bristol while Katie is considering the University of Leeds.
