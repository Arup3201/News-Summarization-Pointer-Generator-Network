A very special therapy dog bringing joy to hospital patients around Melbourne is proving that a dog certainly is man's best friend.

Ralf the Giant Schnauzer was adopted  in 2005 by the Lovick family, who quickly realised that their new dog was much more than just a pet.

The gentle giant has been visiting sick children and aged-care homes for nearly ten years, bringing his special brand of magic to the people who need it most.

'Everybody knows what it feels like to have a bad day. Ralf is happy to be your friend and have a hug. He thinks you’re beautiful and perfect exactly the way you are,' Ralf's owner Caroline Lovick, told Daily Mail Australia.

The Lovick's often have to remind themselves that their beloved family member is a dog, as he behaves in a way that is more human than they could have ever expected. 

'He looks at you and replies even though he hasn't said a thing. He's a very perceptive dog and loves watching Australia's Funniest Home Videos and scenes from Frozen,' Caroline said.   

Ralf's special talents were first spotted when Caroline and her family took the Giant Schnauzer to compete at the Royal Melbourne Show in 2005 and a small girl with Asperger's Syndrome rushed over to pat him.

'Ralf melted like a marshmallow,' Caroline said in 'Ralf', the newly released biography of his extraordinary life.

One of the organisers of the show relayed the incident to a representative from Dog's Victoria, which runs programs to train dogs to be therapy animals.

Caroline, along with her husband Sam, are passionate about volunteering, and jumped at the chance to give back to the community through the talents of their beloved family member.

Ralf quickly became a reguar visitor at the Trinity Manor family owned aged care home in Melbourne, visiting the residents for up to six hours each week and bringing a smile to the faces of many who lived there.

'When Ralf came in he brought an element of magic. He helped us see the best in people, helped us see them come out from the shadow of dementia,' said Jessie Bainbridge, the Lifestyle Co-ordinator of Trinity Manor.

'He really made a difference to people’s lives,' she said.

Ralf visited the residents in common areas, in their rooms, even in the centre's hair salon, offering companionship and quiet solace and even sparking memories in some of the patients suffering from dementia.

Caroline said the way that Ralf interacted with the residents was all the reward she needed. 

‘I wish I could bottle those moments,' she said in the biography.

After six and a half years visiting the manor and building friendships with the staff and residents, Caroline and Ralf decided it was time to move on.

When a friend suggested that the gentle giant might be a good therapy dog for the Melbourne Royal Children’s Hospital, Caroline and Ralf began visiting every second Friday. 

Ralf became a hit at the hospital, and parents began requesting appointments on Fridays so that they could tell their child that they were going to see Ralf.

Caroline said that Ralf fell in love with all the children and that it gave her so much joy to see him working and playing with them. 

Ralf already had experience with 'children', as he was the father of Ivy, another Giant Schnauzer who he fathered with his 'wife' Lulu.

'He particularly loves babies, and he'll go down on all fours to make himself smaller than the child so that they're not afraid of him,' she said.

‘I think now, “I’ll do anything to make your child smile, to make you smile, to make your life a bit better",' Caroline said in the book.

One child who had a special bond with Ralf was Zeke Harrison, who met the therapy dog while he was in the Intensive Care Unit for a MSUD, a rare condition which turns protein in toxins.

Zeke had been in and out of hospital since he was only a few days old, and had been hospitalised 28 times since his first birthday, causing great distress to his parents.

The 15-month-old was in the RMCH with a virus, and instantly brightened when the shaggy black Schnauzer arrived at his bedside.

'It just made him so much happier...I was happy to see his little smile. And Ralf's adorable,' said Jazmin Hall, Zeke's mum.

A photograph snapped of the toddler walking alongside his huge furry friend quickly made the rounds in both local and international media, shooting Ralf to fame and raising awareness of the work that the RMCH does.

Summer Wilson, a five-year-old who had been suffering from an undiagnosed illness which caused liquid to pool in her vital organs, also created a special bond with Ralf.

Two days before a scheduled heart transplant, Ralf was at the hospital for a visit, and provided some much needed relief for her parents Samantha and Chris.

‘Before Ralf came, nothing positive had happened, everything was bad…Seeing the joy on Summer’s face made us forget what was going on, it was like a little breakthrough. It was like hope,' Samantha said in the biography.

Two-and-a-half year old Claire Couwenberg had been a series of medical tests and treatments since doctors had found a cancerous growth the size of a football on her kidney.

The formerly lively young girl was refusing to walk or even move from her wheelchair, and her mother Marie was delighted when Ralf transformed her attitude when he offered himself for a walk.

'She was so determined to walk with Ralf. Nothing else mattered to her- for a moment it was like she wasn't even sick. It made me so happy,' Marie said in the biography.

Claire's parents attribute the speed of Claire's recovery to Ralf, and said that the meeting gave them renewed hope.

'If you can make someone smile at a low point in their life then that is wonderful. It’s like a gift, like someone giving you a beautiful present, and I get to watch and witness little bits of happiness every time Ralf and I visit,' Caroline said. 

Ralf turns 11 this year, which is 'ancient in Giant Schnauzer years', and suffered his own health scare when he was diagnosed with arthritis and cancer in his toe.

Caroline said that while she knows Ralf won't be around forever, she has treasured the moments she has shared with him and the people they have met, and is incredibly proud of the work ralf has done.  

‘I feel completely spoilt and privileged that I go to work with Ralf- I’ve loved every minute of it,' Caroline said.

'It’s a little window, a nugget and it’s not going to last forever. I feel so incredibly lucky to have Ralf in the world’.
