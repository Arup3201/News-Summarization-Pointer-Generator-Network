Wayne Rooney will shortly establish himself as the most-celebrated player in English football history.

Against Slovenia next month he is expected to win his 100th cap for England, putting him in prime position to break Peter Shilton’s all-time record of 125 appearances.

Sir Bobby Charlton is also in his sights, his goalscoring record for both England and Manchester United also within range.

But in Croxteth, the suburb of Liverpool in which he grew up, it appears he remains what he always was: just another street player ready for a kickabout.

The England captain has revealed that on his frequent visits back to Merseyside, he still enjoys a game on the streets where he grew up.

In case Louis van Gaal and the Manchester United medical staff start worrying, he insists that it is very low intensity stuff – keepy ups and tricks rather than a full-scale game.

Nevertheless, it is a delightful image to imagine, the man who will captain England against Estonia hanging out by a park bench with his mates and knocking a ball around.

‘I’ve always believed myself to be from the streets in terms of football,’ said Rooney. ‘I’ve always played on the streets with friends and still do now and again when I get time, I go and do that. That is where I learnt to play football. There was a lot of help along the way from the academy but the majority of my football was learnt on the streets.

‘Now and again I go back and see friends where I am from and we have a kick around. Everywhere we go, we sit there and there is a ball. I’m obviously not running around but we stand there and have a kick-around. Nobody is really fussed. I’m back there quite a lot. It’s just keepy-ups and messing around.’

Given England’s start to their qualifying it seems certain Rooney will be captaining England into Euro 2016 and probably the World Cup in Russia, 2018. By that time the significant England records should have been broken by him: Shilton’s 125 caps and Charlton’s 49 goals.

‘I couldn’t imagined that when I made my first appearance for England,’ said Rooney. ‘At that age you don’t look beyond the next game. You are lucky and it is a privilege to play for England in the games that I’ve clocked up. It’s there now, two more games. I’ve always said that I don’t want to stop playing for England after I get 100 caps, I want to get many more after that and try to do my best for the team.

‘I used to love watching England. I remember the 1998 World Cup and the stand-out moment was Michael Owen and what he did. That is when I really started watching England closely, then at Everton everything happened so quickly for me in terms of the progressing through the youth team and then the first team, then within six months into the England set-up. It is always a dream playing for England and thankfully I’ve done it many times.

‘It’s an honour to play for England, which I’ve said many times. Everyone has seen the likes of Steven Gerrard, Frank Lampard and Ashley Cole in recent times pass the 100-cap mark and hopefully I play in the next two games and I can do that. It will be a proud moment for me.’

Wayne Rooney made his England debut as a substitute in a 3-1 defeat by Australia at Upton Park in 2003

Rooney’s first appearance came in controversial circumstances, a 3-1 defeat against Australia in 2003 at Upton Park in which Sven Goran Eriksson was heavily criticised for substituting the entire team at half. At least Eriksson got something right: Rooney was one of the second-half substitutes.

‘It was a bit strange,’ said Rooney. ‘Australia at West Ham and we lost 3-1. It was a complete change at half-time. I came on. It was great as me and Franny Jeffers played the second half up front together. We were from the same area and same school and had a few coaches coming up from the school taking the kids to watch. I’d only just left school as well. It was a great day.’

Eleven and a half years on, the century looms and then at least another two years of games. Suddenly Shilton’s record of 125 caps seems well within range. ‘I believe so,’ said Rooney. ‘I think it’s 16 or 17 games before the Euros start so I obviously won’t be too far away then and then I have at least another two years after that. I’m happy if they all fit in. There is no reason to think about stop playing.’
