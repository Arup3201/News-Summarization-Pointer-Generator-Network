Seven tourists died today when they were struck by huge rocks tumbling down a mountain in one of China's most popular beauty spots, according to the People's Daily Online.

The rocks - including a three-metre wide (10ft) boulder - hit the group of travellers as they waited to board boats on Li River in the Diecai Mountain scenic area in Guilin.

Twenty-five people were also injured in the accident, who are receiving medical treatment at Guilin People's Hospital and Guilin No. 2 People's Hospital. Among them 13 have left the hospitals.

Pictures from the scene showed a large rock resting on a slope by the lake, with other fragments resting on shattered pavements, and pools of blood on the ground close to handbags, shoes and other personal items.

People who claimed to have witnessed the tragedy wrote on a local internet forum that the tourists were hit on the heads and abdomens.

Some tourists were pushed down the river by rocks, said the same source. 

Death: Seven of the tourists were killed when the boulders fell, while 25 more were injured

Devastation: One boulder was three metres wide, but appears to have shattered into many smaller ones

Officials said four people in the group - believed to be a mix of mainland Chinese and Taiwanese tourists - were killed at the scene, while three others died later at hospital.

Among the injured tourists, eight have been confirmed to be Taiwanese. 

Local authorities are currently identifying the victims.

The beauty spot, in the southern region of Guangxi, is known for its karst mountains and caves, and is a popular site for Chinese and foreign visitors, with Diecai Mountain - also known as Folded Brocade Hill - offering stunning views.

This particular area is prone to rockfall due to its geographic feature, according to Chinese media. 

The local government are taking further actions onsite to ensure the area is safe to travel again.
