Armed robber Keith Haney, 54, was awarded £500 compensation after delays in the prison system breached his human rights

A paedophile and a dangerous armed robber have won hundreds of pounds in compensation after judges controversially ruled delays in the prison system breached their human rights.

In a ruling certain to spark outrage among victims, Keith Haney, 54, and Geoffrey Massey, 55, were awarded controversial pay-outs because they were forced to spend longer in prison.

The Supreme Court said a shortage of places on treatment courses meant the criminals had been forced to endure ‘excessive delays’ to their release dates.

It is feared the decision could open the compensation floodgates and lead even more prisoners to bring legal claims if they are not freed on schedule.

The ruling is also another blow to Justice Secretary Chris Grayling who last week was told his ban on sending books to inmates in jail was unlawful.

Taxpayers have already spent more than £20,000 in legal aid so they could fight the cases which had already been thrown out by the High Court and Court of Appeal.

Haney, a career criminal from Fenham, Newcastle, was jailed for life in 2003 for a ‘very serious’ armed bank robbery committed with two other masked men. 

The raiders – at least one of whom carried a sawn-off shotgun – jumped down from the roof of the Lloyds TSB branch in Ryton, Newcastle, after closing time while only a skeleton staff was on duty.

They ordered four terrified female bank clerks to lie on the floor and think of their families, then forced their way into the safe and escaped with £78,000 cash.

Haney was told in June 2011 he would shortly be moved to an open prison at HMP Kirklevington Grange, North Yorkshire (pictured). The move was postponed because of a 'logjam'

Haney, who was arrested by armed police outside Newcastle General Hospital as he took his girlfriend to be treated for a broken arm, was later handed a life sentence under the ‘two strikes and you’re out’ policy.

At the time of the offence he had been out on licence for just two months following an eight-year sentence for an attempted raid on a security van in Wallsend. 

He had also received a five year sentence in 1992 for his part in another armed robbery on a security van.

Haney was told in June 2011 he would shortly be moved to an open prison at HMP Kirklevington Grange, North Yorkshire.

But the move was postponed because of a ‘logjam’ caused by other prisoners whose progress through the system had been affected by the shortage of treatment courses.

Judges at the Supreme Court ruled Haney had endured a 12-month delay and awarded him £500 compensation.

In the second case, Massey, who had a string of criminal convictions for robbery, fraud, theft and indecent assault, was convicted in May 2008 of a series of sex offences against young boys.

The former railway guard, from Leicester, was given an IPP (imprisonment for public protection) sentence with a minimum term of two-and-a-half years.

Paedophile Geoffrey Massey also received a pay-out following a hearing at the Supreme Court (pictured above) in Westminster

But a shortage of sex offender treatment places meant his release was ‘delayed unacceptably’ by about a year, said the Supreme Court. He was awarded £600 compensation.

Both cases were a breach of Article 5 of the European Convention on Human Rights, which protects the right to liberty.

The judges said the delays had ‘deprived [them] of a reasonable opportunity to demonstrate that [they were] no l longer a danger to the public.’

The court rejected similar claims by sex offender Andrew Robinson, 53, who has a series of convictions against young girls, and Faisal Kaiyam, 33, serving a minimum term of two years and eight months for a offences including robbery.

A Ministry of Justice spokesman said: ‘We welcome the Court’s findings that indeterminate sentence prisoners are not being detained arbitrarily, even if there are regrettable delays in providing them with access to course work which they definitely need in order to reduce their risk.

‘We will study other parts of the judgment carefully to determine how best we can support those on indeterminate sentence towards their potential release.’
