Who could forget that yellow tartan skirt suit, the iconic uniform worn by rich kid Cher Horowitz in the cult movie Clueless.

The film is loosely based on Jane Austin's 1816 novel Emma, following the life of the rich and popular Cher Horowitz (Alicia Silverstone) who has a softer side and strives to help the less fortunate.

Clueless has since become one of the 90s most iconic films seeing it grossing over $56m and now it is seeing a certain resurgence as it takes the fashion world by storm.

Seeing double: Metail allows customers to 'try on' Cher Horowitz's wardrobe in an online fitting room

Iggy Azalea channeled the preppy film star in her recent video for her single Fancy and the Clueless style obsession doesn't end there.

Online fitting company Metail have today launched a digital fitting room based on the one that Cher Horowitz originally used in the 1995 classic film.

The digital wardrobe allows customers to create their own 'MeModel' by inputting three basic body measurements (height, weight and bra size) and then try on Cher's famous wardrobe and create different outfits.

The clothing options include some of Cher's most famous looks, including the infamous yellow plaid skirt suit

Metail's Horowitz picks include this classic Cher look, the yellow plaid skirt  and preppy white shirt both available at Warehouse

Bold choice: Plaid may not be an obvious style option now but it was the thing to be seen in during the 90s

Each MeModel in this digital fitting room will automatically wear Cher's white socks and black T-bar shoes for immediate visual recognition and then customers can then customise their MeModel according to their taste.

The fitting room  experience is made even authentic by allowing customers to gain a second opinion from their friends.

Each outfit created on a MeModel can be shared on Facebook, via email or a link to friends. Outfit choices can also be viewed by the customers' friends on the site acting as their much trusted style advisors.

Metail's CEO, Tom Adeyoola says that adding the share option makes online shopping even more realistic for customers, recreating a true-to-life shopping experience.

'Adding the share capability to our product is a key milestone for us which will be rolled out with our commercial partners in the forthcoming months.

'We know through feedback that the share option is key to moving our user experience forward. Sharing outfit combinations with friends for comment and advice in the same way that consumers shop for clothing on the high-street has been a key experience missing from the online shopping experience, until now'

The software takes customers measurements allowing for a truly authentic fitting

Metail's bespoke Digital Fitting Room launches on 2 July 2014 with the #ShareYourCher wardrobe. MeModels are also available to create on fashion retail sites around the globe including Warehouse and Dafiti.

In celebration of the launch Metail are giving away £500 to the best Cher look that is shared on the site, so get sharing!

Once consumers have created their own personal MeModel, it can be accessed on any website offering the MeModel service online.
