An airman who came home from deployment in Afghanistan a month early surprised his teen son by dressing as the opposing team for a heart-warming reunion.

Master Sergeant Joseph Martel's wife Julia knew he was coming home early, but they kept the news from their son Justin.

Kendall picked up her husband at Spangdahlem Air Force base in Germany last September and the two of them took a road trip to Brussels, Belgium, where Justin was participating in a school football game.

Joyous reunion: Master Sergeant Joseph Martel returned home from deployment in Afghanistan a month earlier than expected, so he and his wife Julia decided to give his son a big surprise

As they arrived at the The International School of Brussels two hours later, Martel suited up in his disguise and marched out onto the field.

He stood before his son briefly, before taking off his helmet and revealing his identity.

Touching video of the moment shows Justin heaving with tears beneath the helmet as he embraces his dad before a hushed crowd.

'I had no idea it was going to happen,' Justin later said. 'All of a sudden he was just there.

'I
 thought he was, I don't even know how many miles (away). The next thing
 you know he's standing there and I'm giving him a hug.'

Road trip: Julia and Martel, who'd landed at their home at Germany's Spangdahlem Air Base, drove two hours to Belgium, where their son Justin was playing a football game

Touching: Martel wore a helmet onto the field and stood before his son. He then revealed his identity and they embraced as before a hushed crowd

Overcome: There wasn't a dry eye on the field, and that included Justin who took off his helmet, as well, exposing his tears of joy

'I had no idea it was going to happen,' Justin later said. 'All of a sudden he was just there'
