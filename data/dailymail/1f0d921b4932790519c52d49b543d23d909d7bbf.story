White Dee announced she is finally off benefits today and admitted the welfare system is far too open to abuse.

The Benefits Street star had sparked anger by insisting she still deserves handouts while headlining bar crawls in Magaluf and pocketing fees for TV appearances.

After reports that the Department of Work and Pensions was investigating her benefits, she revealed today that she is no longer receiving state support.

White Dee has revealed she is no longer claiming benefits after raking in money from media appearances

Dee hit out at the welfare system on ITV's This Morning, saying it allowed some people to live 'too comfortably'

After four years unemployed, she said too many benefits claimants are milking the system and have no motivation to get a job.

She told ITV's This Morning: 'Maybe it shouldn't be made so comfortable for people on benefits.

'There are genuine people on benefits who do really want to find a job but then there's other people who are so comfortable that they are thinking: "Well why should I find a job, because I'm perfectly happy living how I am?"'

Despite presenter Phillip Schofield revealing Dee was getting £500 for the 20-minute appearance on the show, she insisted most the deals her agent got her were 'not that lucrative'.

Dee - real name Deidre Kelly - claimed she still suffers from the 'bereavement depression' which has prevented her from getting a job, but hoped her new career as a reality TV star would mean she can now support herself.

She said: 'It's something that's happened to me. I've been absolutely catapulted into a completely different world, but if now is a chance to provide a better future for my children then I'm going to do it, but I'll do it legally.' 

Dee renewed her war of words with Josie Cunningham, who recently appeared naked after demanding a boob job on the NHS. Dee, who Cunningham has attacked online, said Cunningham was openly mocking taxpayers

The mother-of-two also insisted she was only drinking shandy and water during an appearance in Magaluf

She added: 'I didn't go on them [benefits] with the view of staying on them for the rest of my life.'

Dee renewed her hostilities with Josie Cunningham, who became famous for insisting she deserved a breast implant operation on the NHS.

Showing off her gold-painted nails, Dee, 42, said: 'She's actually just rubbing it in the taxpayers' faces. I mean, fund it yourself, it does really make me angry.'

The pair clashed after Cunningham claimed Dee was jealous of her youth. Dee replied: 'I'm perfectly happy with my life, thank you very much.'

Dee's lifestyle came in for criticism when she appeared downing drinks and knocking back beers on the stage of a 'Carnage Magaluf' night earlier this year.

Today, she claimed she had only been drinking water and shandy but had pulled the stunts as part of her appearance on the bar crawl night.
