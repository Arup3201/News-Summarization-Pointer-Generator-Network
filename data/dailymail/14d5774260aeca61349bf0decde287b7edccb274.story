President Barack Obama made a rare visit to his hometown yesterday.

The President jaunted over to Chicago, Illinois, last night for a pair of Democratic Party fundraisers after a trip to Cooperstown, New York, to visit the National Baseball Hall of Fame.

At the fundraisers, Obama noted how nice it was to finally see his friends. 'All of you look the same and I look like Morgan Freeman,' the president told attendees of a Democratic Senatorial Campaign Committee event, according to the White House pool report.

'So the job has been wearing me down a little bit, I admit, grey hear and all that. But Michelle still thinks I'm cute. She’s not ready to trade me in yet.'

The president told his friends it was 'good to be home, now that it's warmed
up.'

'It was a rough winter,' he said.

'But you guys - you
look like you survived it, you're not any worse for wear.'

The DSCC reception was co-hosted by Illinois Senator Dick Durbin at the residence of Michael and Tanya Polsky, whom the president said he was responsible for bringing together.

'I did not know what a significant role I played in making sure that this thing worked out,' he said of their marriage.

'I was wondering, how did Michael get such a beautiful woman?  And now I realize he was basically dropping my name and said, Yeah, the President is my great buddy."

'And so now I know, now I understand, ' Obama said, to laughter.

After the reception, Obama attended a dinner at the home of Fred Eychaner for another DSCC fundraiser.

The White House says tickets to the two events cost between $1,000 and $35,000.

president then slept in his own bed last night at his home in Chicago and had
 breakfast at one of his favorite spots, Valois Restaurant, before 
trekking back to Washington, D.C. today.
