The entire staff at a Los Angeles school where one teacher is accused of feeding his semen to students and another allegedly abused two girls will be removed, it emerged today.

The 88 teachers and 40 support staff at Miramonte Elementary School are being replaced because a full investigation of allegations is disruptive and staffers will require support to get through the scandal, Superintendent John Deasy told parents.

The move comes after three dozen parents and supporters protested in front of the main doors of the school earlier in the day, some carrying a banner that read: 'We the parents demand our children be protected from lewd teacher acts.'

Anger: About three dozen parents gathered outside the school yesterday morning before joining a 100-strong group for a meeting with the school's administrators last night

Accused: Mark Berndt, 61, (left) was charged with carrying out lewd acts on 23 children who were aged six to 10. His colleague Martin Springer (right) has been held on $2m bail over claims he fondled two girls.

Their outrage comes after teacher Mark
Berndt, 61, was charged with carrying out lewd acts on 23 children who 
were aged six to 10.

He 
allegedly blindfolded the students in his classroom and fed them his 
semen with a spoon. Children were allegedly told it was a 'tasting 
game'.

Teacher
Martin Springer, 49, was arrested on Friday - just four days later - on
suspicion of fondling two girls in his classroom.

An
entire staff has been trained to come into Miramonte's classrooms to 
take over teaching for the time being and there will be a psychiatric 
social worker in every classroom to help students and staff cope with 
any issues.

Worried about the students: Los Angeles School District Superintendent John Deasy announces that the entire teaching staff of Miramonte Elementary School will be relocated in the wake of the arrests of two teachers over child sexual abuse allegations

Voicing concerns: A student passes protesting parents on his arrival at Miramonte Elementary school yesterday. More than a quarter of students were absent yesterday while parents demanded more protection

Furious: Parent Tessi Garcia airs her grievances to reporters over the sex abuse scandal that has rocked the school

'The last thing I'm worried about is a budget issue,' Deasy said. 'The No 1 thing I'm worried about is the students.'

All employees will be paid during the investigation, district spokesman Tom Waldman said. Officials didn't know how long the investigation will take.

School officials cancelled classes at the school on Tuesday and Wednesday as a cooling-off period, Waldman said. All current staff members will report to another location, where they will be interviewed, he said.

Deasy emphasized that all staff members being brought into the classroom went through a 'very rigorous screening process.'

Deasy told reporters after the meeting that he was trying 'to govern emotion, because that's important.'

Comforting: A parent hugs her child at the start of the school day. School bosses say they are trying to 'govern emotion' as the investigation continues

Driven to act: The protest was an unusual event in the poor, overwhelmingly Latino neighborhood, where many parents and students struggle with the English language

Reassurances: Mr Deasy emphasised that all staff members being brought into the classroom went through a 'very rigorous screening process'

United Teachers Los Angeles said in a statement that union leaders and staff have met with instructors at Miramonte.

'We support a thorough, vigorous and fair investigation of all allegations,' the statement said. 'It's everyone's responsibility to ensure that any and all allegations are thoughtfully and carefully investigated.'

Maria Jimenez, 51, said the parents of children enrolled at Miramonte are divided over the move. 'Some are in favor. Others are against it because they did this without advising us or consulting us,' she said.

More than a quarter of the students at Miramonte were absent from school Monday while parents demanded more protection at the school, with attendance reaching just 72 percent, according to figures from the Los Angeles Unified School District.

The protest was an unusual event in the poor, overwhelmingly Latino neighborhood, where many parents and students struggle with the English language.

Many people finally gathered around 
former state senator-turned-lawyer Martha Escutia, who lectured them in 
Spanish about how to organize for the media and suggested a catchy name 
for their fledgling movement: Mothers of Miramonte.

As night fell, about 100 angry parents marched from the elementary school to the nearby meeting with administrators.

School police watched and sheriff's deputies were on hand, but there was no violence.

Berndt,
who worked at the school for 32 years, was charged with committing lewd
acts on 23 children, ages six to 10, between 2005 and 2010.

Mixed emotions: Parents are divided over the move to remove all the school's staff. Some feel they should have been consulted first

The acts cited by authorities include blindfolding children and feeding them his own semen in his classroom in what children were allegedly told was a tasting game.

Berndt, 61, remains jailed on $23million bail and could face life in prison if convicted.

Springer, 49, was arrested on suspicion of fondling two girls in his classroom. He was being held on $2million bail.

Springer taught at Miramonte for his entire career, which started in 1986, the district said. He taught second grade.

The school board is scheduled to discuss firing him in a closed-door meeting Tuesday.

Furore: Members of the media gather outside the Miramonte last Friday following the arrest of Springer, who was pulled from a classroom just days after Berndt was charged

Concern: Students are escorted to a bus outside Miramonte, which will be closed for two days this week

Investigators said they know of no connection between the Miramonte cases. Berndt and Springer know each other and took their classes on at least two joint field trips in the past decade, according to the Los Angeles Times.

The district set up a toll-free hotline on Monday to receive reports of suspected abuse at Miramonte, said school board President Monica Garcia in a statement.

Garcia added that the district would step up efforts to ensure students and staff realized the importance of reporting misconduct.

In the same school district, a janitor at a San Fernando Valley elementary school was arrested on suspicion of committing a lewd act with a child on a campus.

Paul Adame, 37, was taken into custody after a mother told police on Sunday that he had inappropriate contact with her child during school hours Friday at Germain Elementary School in the Chatsworth area north of Los Angeles, police Capt. Kris Pitcher said at a news conference.

The captain declined to provide details but urged anyone who might know of other possible victims to contact police.

Adame was booked and released on $100,000 bail Monday. It could not be immediately determined if he had an attorney.

There was no immediate connection between the arrest of the janitor and the cases at Miramonte, which is 15 miles (24 kilometers) away in an unincorporated county area of South Los Angeles.
