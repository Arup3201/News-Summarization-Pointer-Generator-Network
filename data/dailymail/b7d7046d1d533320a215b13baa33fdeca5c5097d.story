Whether you're a wine connoisseur or malt whisky lover, the state you live in could reveal far more about your drinking habits than you might expect.

Those living in Delaware, Washington and Massachusetts, for instance, are the nation's biggest boozers, according to a survey of their tweets.

Overall, Washington D.C. had the most tweets per capita about wine and beer, and they also had the second most tweets about liquor.

In terms of alcohol related tweets, Delaware tops the list, following by D.C, Massachusetts, Nevada and Rhode Island. As a nation, the US enjoyed talking about beer and malt liquor far more than they do about wine

However, when it came to announcing abusive behaviours – such as getting drunk or 'crunk' – Washington didn't even get into the top five. That unfavourable distinction went to New Jersey.

Meanwhile, the South – often portrayed in media as the beer-drinking capital of America – had only three states that ranked in the top 10 for beer tweets.

In fact, it's the only region in the U.S. that prefers hard liquor to beer and malt liquor, according to the survey.

The data was compiled by California-based addition helpline, Project Know, who wanted to raise awareness of the US' drinking problem.

The research also shows 31 per cent of men drink to get drunk compared to only 21 per cent of women. Age is a factor as well, with 40 per cent of college students reporting they drink to get drunk - or 'crunk'

To find out more about drinking habits around the country, the team surveyed more than 1,000 people and analysed 450,000 tweets about beer, liquor, wine, and drinking.

As well as the types of alcohol consumers, the research also shows 31 per cent of men drink to get drunk compared to only 21 per cent of women.

Age is a factor as well, with 40 per cent of college students reporting they drink to get drunk.

Hard liquor is the strongly preferred choice of college students (66 per cent), but beer is the overall preferred drink of Americans.

The survey also found that 25 per cent of men have taken 'shower beers', and 13 per cent of women admit to doing the same.

A 'shower beer' is better you take into the shower when you're in a hurry to go out or want to relax from a long day.

According to the American Council for Drug Education (ACDE) around 10 to 15 million people in the United States can be classified as alcoholics.

The statistics show that alcohol dependence will affect 17 per cent of men and eight per cent of women at some point in their lives.
