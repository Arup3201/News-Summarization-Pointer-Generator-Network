Arsenal striker Lukas Podolski has shot down reports that he is being lined up for a £10million move to bitter rivals Tottenham.

The World Cup winner posted a message on his Twitter account, saying: 'Hell would freeze over before this transfer would happen #Poldi #aha #AlwaysAGunner #Nevercheatyourclub #afc #RedArmy'.

Reports suggest the Germany forward has grown frustrated at his lack of playing time - with Arsene Wenger yet to start him in the Premier League this season, preferring Alexis Sanchez and Danny Welbeck.

Lukas Podolski has swiftly nipped rumours of a move from Arsenal to Tottenham in the bud

The World Cup winner made it clear in no uncertain terms that he wouldn't be leaving for White Hart Lane

The fact the 29-year-old has been unable to force his way in even though Arsenal have also been without long-term absentees Theo Walcott and Olivier Giroud has led to uncertainty over his future.

Speaking after winning his 120th cap for Germany in the 1-1 draw with the Republic of Ireland, Podolski said: 'I have assessed my position in the team, and it has to change now.

'Let's see what happens in the winter. The fact is that I'm not happy with it, that's clear.'

What is also clear is that, should the former Cologne forward decide to leave the club, he will not be moving across north London to White Hart Lane.

Podolski arrived at the Emirates for £11m in 2012 and has scored 28 goals from 74 appearances - with 20 of those coming from the bench.
