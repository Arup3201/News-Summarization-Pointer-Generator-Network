Just days after it bought Beats, the headphone firm founded by Dr Dre and Jimmy Iovine, Apple has revealed plans to abandon the headphone socket and make consumers buy headphones with a new connector.

Apple's plans allow headphone makers to use the Lightning socket normally used for charging and adding accessories.

The firm is expected to use the Beats brand to launch the first headphones to use the connector.

Apple recently bought Beats, the headphone and music firm set up by Dr Dre (pictured) and Jimmy Iovine. Now it is expected to use the firm to create headphones that connect via the lightning port, bypassing the headphone socket.

Beats was founded in 2008 by Dr. Dre, now a hip-hop producer, and Iovine, a longtime recording industry executive who is currently chairman of Universal Music Group's Interscope Geffen A&M Records.

It now dominates the luxury headphone market.

Its equipment also has been a big seller in Apple's stores.

Operating from its Culver City, California, headquarters, Beats commands 62 percent of the $1 billion U.S. market for headphones priced above $100, according to NPD Group.

The gear, which emphasizes bass, also has been endorsed by several star athletes, including San Francisco 49ers quarterback Colin Kaepernick and New Jersey Nets forward Kevin Garnett.

Beats Music, the music streaming subsidiary of the electronics maker, has more than 250,000 subscribers, according to Cook.

According to 9to5mac, Apple revealed the new system earlier this week.

'We’ve learned Apple has quietly introduced a new specification for manufacturers in its Made-For-iPhone/iPad/iPod (MFi) program that allows them to create headphones that connect to iOS devices using a Lightning connector instead of the usual 3.5mm headphone jack,' the site said.

The Lightning headphones will be capable of receiving lossless stereo 48 kHz digital audio output from Apple devices and sending mono 48 kHz digital audio input.

The input means that the headphones will also support a microphone for audio input following Apple’s upcoming update.

Manufacturers will be able to add buttons to launch apps.

Headphones will also be able to draw power from the phone - useful for noise cancelling features, for instance.

A previous report claimed Apple was working on a version of its own in-ear EarPods using a Lightning connector and planned to enable higher-resolution audio playback in iOS 8.

The $3bn acquisition of Beats is by far the most expensive in Apple's 38-year history, and comes three weeks after the deal was first rumoured - although the initial price was believed to be $3.2bn.

Apple Boss Tim Cook revealed the deal, saying 'We have known these guys forever, we've dated, we've gone steady and now we are getting married.'

'I’ve always known in my heart that Beats belonged with Apple,' said Jimmy Iovine.

As part of the acquisition, Beats co-founders Jimmy Iovine and Dr. Dre will join Apple.

'The idea when we started the company was inspired by Apple’s unmatched ability to marry culture and technology.

Apple’s deep commitment to music fans, artists, songwriters and the music industry is something special.'

The price consists of $2.6 billion in cash and $400 million in Apple stock that will vest over an unspecified time period.

The deal is expected to close before the end of September.

It is believed Apple is also interested in Beats expertise in developing wearable products and it edges closer to a much anticipated iWatch launch, 

With $1.1 billion in revenue last year, Beats is already making money and will boost Apple's earnings once the new fiscal year begins in October, Apple CEO Tim Cook said in an interview.

'This relationship started a decade ago, so we know there is an incredible cultural fit.

'These two guys have a very rare set of skills. It's like finding a particular grain of sand on the beach. It's that rare.'

Iovine, 61, and Dre, 49, will both become key executives in Apple's music divisions, though Cook said their roles haven't been determined yet.

Cook said Beats' music streaming service was the main selling point in the deal.

The growing popularity of music streaming services such as Pandora and Spotify has been reducing sales of songs and albums, a business that iTunes has dominated for the past decade. 

U.S. sales of downloaded songs slipped 1 percent last year to $2.8 billion while streaming music revenue surged 39 percent to $1.4 billion, according to the Recording Industry Association of America.
