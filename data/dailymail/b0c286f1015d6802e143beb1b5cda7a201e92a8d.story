Alan Pardew is banking on forgotten man Papiss Cisse rescuing goal-shy Newcastle United.

The Magpies have failed to score in more matches than any other League club in 2014 and are one of only two yet to find the back of the net in the top flight this season.

Even Tuesday’s 1-0 win at League One Gillingham in the Capital One Cup arrived courtesy of an own goal from former Sunderland player John Egan.

Better times: Papiss Cisse celebrates scoring against Chelsea at Stamford Bridge in May 2012

Papiss Cisse and Nikica Jelavic were both winter-window signings in 2012. Before the end of the season Cisse had scored 13 times for Newcastle, while Jelavic had netted 12 for Everton following his £5m transfer from Rangers. 

In two years since both have struggled for league goals. Cisse has 10 and Jelavic only netted his 12th for Hull at the weekend. 

Pardew insists that goals do reside in his team and says he was not tempted to enter the race for Shane Long who cost £12million, Ross McCormack, who cost £11m, and Jordan Rhodes, whose proposed £12m move from Blackburn to Hull collapsed yesterday.

Instead, Pardew will wait for Cisse. The Senegal forward has been sidelined since April with a broken kneecap but will return to training next week.

The 29-year-old, however, had seemingly been written off by the management team at St James’ Park after starting just 15 league games last term, returning two goals.

Cisse, of course, was one of Europe’s hottest properties two years ago having smashed 13 goals in three months following a £9m January switch from Freiburg, a first-time volley from an impossible angle at Chelsea the pick of that haul. He has, though, netted just 10 times since.

Out of favour: The Senegalese striker failed to impress at St. James' Park last season, starting just 15 league games and finding the net only twice 

Help: Pardew's (left) £6m summer signing, Emmanuel Riviere (right), is yet to find the net for the Magpies 

But with £6m summer signing Emmanuel Riviere yet to get off the mark in three attempts, Pardew is hoping Cisse can rediscover the free-scoring form of 2012 as the United boss risks a £35m close-season investment being undone by a lack of firepower.

‘I do remember not so long ago us all talking very highly about Papiss and whether we could keep him,’ said Pardew, whose side drew 0-0 at Aston Villa on Saturday despite dominating in the second half.

‘I think with Papiss that there’s a possibility that he could score a lot of goals in this team so I wouldn’t write him off by any stretch of the imagination.

‘If we’re going to bring in a player they have to be better and above Riviere and Papiss, otherwise there is no point.

‘When you look at the transfers, Jordan Rhodes, McCormack to Fulham and Shane Long to Southampton, and you look at their prices, I don’t think we would have done those three transfers.’

Team Games Failed to score %

Newcastle 21 14 66.67

Hartlepool 27 14 51.85

Blackpool 27 13 48.15

Norwich 23 11 47.83

Cardiff 23 11 47.83

 

Pardew’s side have failed to score in 14 of 21 Premier League matches this calendar year, and – at 66 per cent - that is a higher ratio than any of the 92 League clubs.

Cisse appeared in half of those scoreless outings, but Pardew said: ‘The chances he was given last year didn’t really help his cause and there were a lot of games where he trawled through for us because we never created enough for him.

‘He had like two or three chances a game and he fluffed his lines a little bit but he probably needs more than that. Top strikers do need more than that and I’d never put off the fact that he can come again - and come again here.’
