A Seattle high school teacher who admitted to having sex with a 17-year-old student was sentenced to 20 months in prison on Tuesday.

'I was selfish,' the 33-year-old told the judge.

Allen pleaded guilty in August to charges of first-degree sexual misconduct with a minor and violation of a no-contact order, reports Komo.

Guilty: Former high school biology teacher Michael Allen, 33, was sentenced to 20 months in prison on Tuesday

Court documents reveal that Allen had sex numerous times with a 17-year-old student and despite being arrested and charged he continued to contact the victim.

'What I did was inappropriate and wrong,' he added.

The News Tribune reports that Allen got no argument from Judge Frank Cuthbertson.

'You hurt a lot of people,' said Judge Cuthbertson.

Allen is married and has two young children, both of whom are utterly confused about the situation.

'You hurt your children. You obviously hurt your wife and her family, and you did great harm to the victim in this case. Her life was completely disrupted. Her family was completely disrupted,' said the judge.

The initial contact with the victim began in January 2014. The two exchanged text messages and formed a relationship that escalated sexual intercourse.

School administrators learned of the inappropriate contact on January 17 and they placed Allen on administrative leave and he was ordered not to contact the victim.

Father and husband: Michael Allen didn't only damage the victim, he hurt his wife and children by chasing a 17-year-old student in an inappropriate relationship 

Administrators launched an internal investigation and found thousands of messages between Allen and the victim even after he was told not to reach her.

The school reported the incident to the police on February 11 and the victim told detectives she had sex with Allen three times after he was placed on leave.

Allen was given a court order not to contact the victim and was placed on $25,000 bail.

On February 24 the victim confessed that Allen contacted her via Twitter through a friend and that he gave her a pre-paid cell phone so that they could continue to talk.

Allen was then charged with violating a court order and a new bail was set at $125,000.

After Allen finishes his prison sentence he will have to undergo a psychosexual evaluation, treatment, and register as a sex offender.

Perhaps even more challenging, he will need to suffer the consequences of hurting his wife and children.

His wife wrote a letter to the judge detailing how Allen’s actions tore their family apart.

Deputy prosecutor Sabrina Ahrens read the letter that brought Allen to tears.

'We used to be a happy family,' the letter stated.

It also spoke of Allen's children's confusion about their father's absence.

Allen's wife is filing for divorce and Allen has become an outcast among his loved ones.

'I’ve made some horrible decisions, your honor, and I’m ashamed of them,' Allen said.

‘There are no excuses for my actions. That time period, I don’t know who I was.'

'You’re right about one thing,' the judge told Allen. 'It was selfish.'
