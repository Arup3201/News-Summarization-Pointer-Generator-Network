An unclaimed camera that led the crew of a United Airlines international flight to divert to Boston has been X-rayed and found to be safe, police say.

Passengers were evacuated from the plane during an inspection by bomb technicians at a remote area of Logan International Airport at about 9.45 pm yesterday.

Massachusetts State police spokesman David Procopio said the flight was now resuming.

According to the Boston Globe, he said: 'Passengers will be allowed back on.

'Once the X-ray proved negative for anything hazardous, it was not necessary to sweep the plane with our bomb dogs.'

The North American Aerospace Defense Command deployed fighter jets to escort the plane, but the aircraft landed before the jets reached it, Mr Procopio said.

United spokesman Rahsaan Johnson said the crew decided to divert Flight 956, en route from Newark, New Jersey to Geneva, Switzerland, after flight attendants found the camera in a seat pocket of an unoccupied seat. 

Johnson said there was 157 passengers and 11 crew members on board the Boeing 767. 

The Transportation Security Administration said the plane was diverted ‘out of an abundance of caution’ and its officers responded.
