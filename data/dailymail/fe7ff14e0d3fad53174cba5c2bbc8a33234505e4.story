The QWERTY keyboards on BlackBerry phones may have fallen by the wayside in favour of touchscreens, but many users still prefer the feel of real keys when typing on devices.

With this in mind, a Californian firm has developed an iPhone and iPad case that adds tactile keys to touchscreens.

And with the slide of a button, the keys disappear so the owner can use the touchscreen for games and other apps.

Called Phorm, the case was designed by Tactus Technology which specialises in physical keyboards for mobile devices.

Phorm consists of a case, with a slider on the rear, and a screen protector lined with 'microfluidics'.

These small amounts of fluid raise up from the screen when the slide is activated, and disappear when the slider is moved back into position.

These bumps are called Finger Guides and sit above each individual key on the keyboard, other than the space bar.

The case has been designed for the iPad mini and iPhone 6 Plus and works with all native iOS keyboards, as well as downloadable keyboards Swiftkey, Swype and Fleksy.

The case is available for pre-order for $99 in the US now, and will go on sale widely in the summer.

Tactus said it plans to launch in other regions once the pre-orders are shipped and it is working on cases for other phones.

‘Once installed, Phorm acts as a protective case and screen protector for your device’ said the firm.

‘When you want to type, you can raise up the Finger Guides on the screen protector by sliding the slider on the back. The Finger Guides appear on top of the on-screen keyboard.

‘You type normally as you always do on your device's touch screen - Phorm takes care of the rest.’

The company added that the case does not impact on the battery life of the phone or tablet, and people don’t need to learn a specific typing technique.
