Three lap dancers and an actress kidnapped a club boss who failed to pay them £42,000 after the premises were closed down during the Cheltenham National Hunt Festival, a court heard yesterday.

The women appeared in the dock with two men accused of acting as 'heavies' for them in the kidnapping.

Their alleged victim was subjected to violence and threats, and robbed during his ordeal, Martin Steen, prosecuting, told the court.

The dancers, thought to have been 
from a well-known club in London, had been hired to perform in the club 
during the racing festival.

Miss Devaney had been asked to arrange the dancers, waitresses and hostesses for the club by the alleged victim's partner.

But police raided and closed down the
 club, and the club boss did not pay the dancers.

'We say he was kidnapped and subjected to various forms of violence and threats', Mr Steen told Gloucester Crown Court.

'Items were taken from him in a 
robbery. It is not disputed by the Crown that the ladies in question 
were owed money by the victim.'

Actress Charlotte Devaney, 34, of 
London, and dancers Rachel Goodchild, 24, and Mandy-Laura Cool, 29, both of 
Southampton, and Stephanie Pye, 30, of Sutton Coldfield, together with 
brothers Robert Morris, 26, and Alexander Morris, 22, of Southampton, 
are all accused of kidnap on September 3 last year.

All but Pye pleaded not guilty to the
 charge. Pye's lawyer asked for the charge not to be put to her because 
she intends to mount a legal argument asking for it to be dropped.

The Morris brothers also denied robbing the alleged victim of a £4,650 Breitling watch and £60 in cash on the same date.

Alexander Morris further denied 
having a Stanley knife in a public place – the Northway Trading Estate 
at Tewkesbury, Gloucestershire – where the alleged victim works.

Barrister Audrey Archer, representing
 Goodchild, said that she is taking civil court action against the club 
boss for recovery of the money she claims he still owes her. The other 
women were already taking similar court action, she said.

It is the prosecution case that the women were recruited to dance in a room at the Embassy Club in 
Cheltenham during the four-day National Hunt Festival in March last 
year.

On the day the club was closed down 
the women made a complaint to police that they had not been paid the 
£42,000 they said the alleged victim owed them.

It is alleged that the women then 
decided to get the money out of the boss themselves by recruiting the 
two brothers to help them.

Judge William Hart transferred the 
case to Bristol Crown Court on a date to be fixed. He made it a 
condition of bail that the defendants must not contact the alleged 
victim except through solicitors.

Charlotte Devaney describes herself as an international DJ, producer, actress and model.

She had a part in 2008 film How to Lose Friends and Alienate People, which starred Simon Pegg, and has a single coming out this summer with American rapper Snoop Dogg.

A statement released by her publicist said: 'On behalf of myself and the other girls involved in this case, I would like to state categorically that we are not guilty of this charge.

'In actual fact, we have been the wronged party and are confident the truth will come out.

'We are looking forward to going to court later this year to prove our innocence.'
