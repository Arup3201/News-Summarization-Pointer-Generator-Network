A 91-year-old military man who fought in and survived three wars has died from injuries he sustained in a savage home invasion on his Northern California house, just days out from Veterans Day.

John Masson was brutally bashed by a group of thugs who broke into his North Highlands house in the middle of the night on October 28.

Masson, who fought in World War II, the Korean War and Vietnam, put up a fight when the thieves demanded his car keys.

His stepdaughter and caretaker were tied up and blindfolded as part of the invasion, CBS 13 reported.

Veteran: John Masson, who served in the Air Force for a total of 43 years, died in hospital Saturday following a home invasion at his North Highlands house on October 28

Beloved: Masson, seen left with his wife and right more recently, attempted to fight off his attackers

Scene: The incident occurred in the middle of the night on October 28 while Masson was sleeping

Masson managed to get the bandits out and they fled without his car.

However he was severely beaten in the process.

The group also made off with jewelry, prescriptions drugs and some cash.

His stepdaughter, Akemi Girion, told CBS 13 that Masson tried to fight off the thugs 'because he's a military man'.

'His face was all broken,' she said.

'Jaw, cheek, head. Everything was broken.'

Masson died in hospital on Saturday, one week after the attack, the Sacramento County Sheriff’s Office said.

Pleading for help: Girion described her father as a loyal military man and has asked for help from the public in finding the people who attacked him

He served a total of 43 years in the Air Force.

'We were two peas in a pod, and they stole that from me,' Girion said.

'They stole my father.'

No arrests have been made in the case.

It will now be handled as a homicide. 

'Please, help us to catch the people who did that to my father,' Girion said.
