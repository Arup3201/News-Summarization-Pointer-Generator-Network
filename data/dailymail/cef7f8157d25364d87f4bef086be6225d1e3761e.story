He emerged from his Chelsea home with a characteristic smirk and a dark glance, and girlfriend Trinny Woodall firmly on his arm.

Then, with brutally sardonic humour, Charles Saatchi proceeded to make a joke of yet another disturbing set of pictures of him sitting at an outside table at Scott’s, his favourite Mayfair restaurant, and seemingly reducing a girlfriend to tears.

Last summer, it was this very restaurant — and, indeed, this very table — that was the location for the ‘throttling’ lunch that spelled the end of Saatchi’s marriage to Nigella Lawson.

Lunch: Charles Saatchi had a meal with girlfriend Trinny Woodall at Scott's, the Mayfair seafood restaurant, a week after she was spotted there in tears

Charles Saatchi enjoys a glass of wine during lunch on Sunday at Scott's with Trinny Woodall. The two sat outside in a public display which came as pictures of them arguing at the same spot a week earlier were published

In pictures revealed yesterday, he is seen there again. Only this time, it is Trinny, his girlfriend of almost a year, who is clearly seen in serious distress, weeping over her ginger ale.

Saatchi looks on apparently unmoved, smoking cigarettes and drinking most of a bottle of red wine. 

At one point, Trinny removes her sunglasses to wipe away the tears. At another, she leaps to her feet, apparently shouting in fury.

A witness to the incident says that Saatchi glanced around him to check if anyone had noticed what was going on.

Lawyers for the couple deny there was an argument of any sort. But Trinny, 50, who friends declare is ‘the nicest woman in London’, appeared animated, even distraught at times.

After the meal, the pair left together in a taxi. Saatchi, 70, got up first and stood at the taxi rank while Trinny took a few moments, seemingly to compose herself, before joining him.

The parallels to the infamous Nigella incident are crashingly obvious.

Those shocking pictures, in which the multi-millionaire art collector repeatedly put his hands around Nigella’s throat to her evident distress, resulted in a police caution for him.

So, how did Saatchi explain this latest damaging contretemps yesterday?

Standing outside his Chelsea home, the former advertising executive merely declared to the Mail that he and Trinny were ‘unconsciously coupling’.

In keeping with his dark sense of humour, Saatchi twisted the phrase ‘consciously uncoupling’, coined by actress Gwyneth Paltrow to describe her separation from Coldplay star Chris Martin.

Saatchi then ushered Miss Woodall, 50, into a taxi, adding: ‘There, are you happy now?’ 

And off they went for Sunday lunch. Where? Why, to the very same table at Scott’s, of course.

Someone who knows both of them intimately insisted to me yesterday: ‘There is no story. They are very happy together.’

But can this be true — or is history about to repeat itself in Saatchi’s new relationship?

Certainly, it seems that Saatchi, a dictatorial bully, has replaced one vulnerable woman with another.

But, until now, he and Trinny have found a certain peculiar contentment with each other.

The pair started dating only eight weeks after the schism with Nigella and before the trial of the Grillo sisters, the couple’s former housekeepers.

It was during the trial that Nigella admitted she occasionally used cocaine and Saatchi contended that his actions during their notorious lunch were merely intended to help his wife ‘focus’.

It was a strange time to begin a hunt for a new love — but the extraordinary truth is that Saatchi actually selected Trinny from a shortlist drawn up by his second wife, Kay Hartenstein, to whom he is still close.

She was terribly worried that he was ‘falling apart’ without a woman by his side.

Others on the list included Martha Fiennes, the newly single film-maker sister of actor Ralph.

I’m told that upon meeting Trinny, Saatchi murmured, horror-struck: ‘My God! Those lips!’ But despite his initial misgivings, the liaison became very serious, very quickly.

Trinny, too, wasn’t bothered by Saatchi’s reputation.

One friend even went so far as to ask her on her publicly accessible Instagram account last October: ‘I have a personal question. How can you date a man who tried to strangle his ex-wife? You are a smart woman, I can’t understand. You are worth so much more!’ 

Trinny responded: ‘My darling girl — don’t believe what you read in the Press!!!!’

Within three months, Trinny was keeping a toothbrush and clothes at the house in Chelsea that Saatchi used to share with Nigella and her children.

He and Trinny dined out incessantly, often at Scott’s.

During the Grillo trial in December, they seemed to be in high spirits, which is more commonly seen in much younger lovers.

I
 am told Saatchi has spent time with Trinny’s ten-year-old daughter, 
Lyla, by her former husband Johnny Elichaoff. The truth is that Trinny 
enjoys Saatchi’s dictatorial bent.

A few months after her 50th birthday, Woodall looks unhappy as she dines out with boyfriend Saatchi. The meal a week ago ended with the TV personality in tears

And
 while Trinny, a recovering drink and drug addict, is notably more 
sensitive than Nigella Lawson, she, too, seems to love the lifestyle Saatchi 
provides her with.

For example, over Christmas, Saatchi treated Trinny and Lyla to a Caribbean trip on a £25million yacht.

In February, he took her on a romantic break to Madrid to celebrate her 50th birthday.

With
 her fondness for twice-yearly Botox, Victoria Beckham dresses and £180 
pots of Sisley face cream, she is not a low-maintenance partner. But neither is Saatchi.

In echoes of Nigella, Trinny jokes that she is now addicted to ‘sugar and spending’.

And
 she, too, has something of an attraction to ‘damaged’ lovers. Her 
romantic history, which includes  liaisons with a playboy who died of a 
cocaine overdose and a marriage to a banker who fought an addiction to 
painkillers, may mean she is able to handle someone as temperamental as 
the thrice-divorced Saatchi.

A
 month ago came a surprising  episode. Trinny and Saatchi were guests at
 the opening of superchef Alain Ducasse’s restaurant at the Bulgari 
Hotel in Knightsbridge.

It
 was the sort of event that Trinny and her socialite friends adore — but
 to observe the notoriously reclusive Saatchi enjoying blue lobster and 
purple artichoke with half of London’s canape society came as a shock. 

All indications — until these new unsettling images — were of a very happy romance indeed.

So why the tears?

Yesterday,
 friends of Saatchi’s were pressing the suggestion that Trinny may have 
been complaining of continuing back pain, as only four weeks ago she had
 a disc replaced.

That relatively major surgery saw her bed-bound for a week.

She is contemplating facing the school holidays with her daughter in less than perfect health.

The only clue to her condition is she is wearing thick-soled trainers rather than her usual heels.

Saatchi, 
meanwhile, knows only too well that his romance with Trinny has been a 
surprisingly effective tool in rehabilitating his image. If people 
believe he has been bullying her as well, he will lose the PR war he has
 fought heartily since his split from Nigella.

When contacted by a Sunday newspaper about the pictures, Saatchi denied there had been an argument.

In
 a callous piece of humour, he emailed the reporter: ‘Why not send a 
photographer to Scott’s tomorrow lunchtime and I will give Trinny a good
 throttling in time for your deadline?’ 

Next came bluster, when he again emailed the reporter saying: ‘Please don’t do this. There was no argument. This is so stupid.’

After what appeared to be a public fight at Scott's restaurant last weekend Trinny Woodall seems to have forgiven Charles Saatchi and returns to his home with a couple of suitcases

Just before Trinny Woodall turned up at his Chelsea home with two suitcases last weekend after their public spat, Charles Saatchi and his 19-year-old daughter Phoebe arrived there and appeared to be in a playful mood

Finally, came bullying.

‘Oh just run what you like,’ he exclaimed. ‘How would you like it if someone was  looking at you [when you were eating]? It is a lie.

‘Ask Trinny. This is beyond comprehension. I don’t care what it looks like, you can ask me formally through my lawyer. How dare you. I give up.’ 

A letter from a lawyer acting for Woodall and Saatchi swiftly followed.

For her part, Trinny has even employed the same dark humour. Musing in February about her landmark birthday, she wrote online: ‘It’s great that, at 50, life can still grab you by the throat and shake you up.’

Unfortunately for Saatchi, little has dented Nigella Lawson’s popularity. Her U.S. TV show The Taste has been given a third series and she lives happily in west London with her children.

What poison this must be for him.

But, in the wake of recent events, the question must be: is Saatchi’s search for a life partner on again?
