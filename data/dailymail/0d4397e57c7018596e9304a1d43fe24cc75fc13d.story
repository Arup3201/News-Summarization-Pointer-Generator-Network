When Matthew Crawley got down on one knee before Lady Mary in the Christmas snow outside Downton Abbey, it seemed to be the quintessential fairytale proposal.

And now one lucky super-fan of the TV series has had her own fairytale come true, after her clever boyfriend popped the question in exactly the same spot.

Emma Harris, 30, was delighted when her boyfriend Andy Chapman, 38, asked her to marry him in the setting for her favourite ITV drama - Highclere Castle in Hampshire -  pretending to be Matthew Crawley to her Lady Mary.

Miss Harris, who lives in Upnor in Kent, became the future Mrs Chapman during a surprise day out in the grounds of the stately home - the fictional estate of the Earl of Grantham and his family - on a fundraising tour organised by the charity Young Epilepsy.

The surprise began when she turned up at work at 9am that morning and found Mr Chapman waiting for her in the office, ready to whisk her off to Hampshire.

Originally thinking the day out was the whole surprise, Miss Harris was shocked when during the tour her boyfriend got down on one knee and asked her to marry him, just as Matthew Crawley (played by Dan Stevens) had to Lady Mary Crawley (played by Michelle Dockery) in the series.

She said: 'When we 
drove up the huge driveway to the castle I knew it was Downton Abbey, I 
was so excited. It's my favourite show on TV.

'We walked around the grounds of the estate and then out of the blue, Andy proposed. I was overwhelmed and so happy to accept in this beautiful setting.

'The whole experience was lovely - thank 
you so much to Young Epilepsy for organising the day, what you do is 
such a great cause.'

The couple
 toured Highclere thanks to a special event that saw people buying 
tickets for a tour, with the proceeds going to the Young Epilepsy 
charity. The open day at the castle raised £20,000 for the charity.

hristine Mankelow, a spokesman from 
Young Epilepsy, said: 'Andy told us about the proposal before the day. 
It was such a lovely idea and we were more than happy to accommodate the
 happy couple.'
