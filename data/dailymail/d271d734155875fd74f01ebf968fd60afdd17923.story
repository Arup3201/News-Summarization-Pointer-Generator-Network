Bacary Sagna will hold formal talks with Manchester City next week and looks increasingly likely to join the Barclays Premier League champions.

Sagna is set to sign a four-year deal worth £100,000-per-week at the Etihad Stadium.

The right-back wants his future sorted prior to Brazil 2014 because he wants to head into the tournament with a clear mind.

And now, barring a collapse in discussions next week, Sagna will become the latest Gunner to join City - following the lead of Gael Clichy and Samir Nasri in recent seasons.
