A picture of Aaron Hernandez brandishing a gun may show the weapon that was used to kill Odin Lloyd, prosecutors have claimed.

The photo of the New England Patriot, taken in 2009 and published in TMZ last year, shows the football player posing with a Glock pistol.

At a court hearing on Monday for Hernandez, who is trying to have a murder charge dismissed, prosecutors said the gun appeared to be the same type as the weapon used to kill Lloyd.

Questions: This 2009 photo of Hernandez posing with a gun could show the weapon used to kill Lloyd, prosecutors claim

The picture, taken in an apartment Hernandez used to live in, was part of the evidence put forward as to why the charges should still stand.

'It was consistent with the ballistic 
evidence in this case, projectiles recovered from the body of Odin 
Lloyd, as well as the shell casings that had distinct markings that at 
least were consistent with the markings from the Glock manufacturer,' 
prosecutors said.

Hernandez's attorneys had asked a judge to throw out one of the former NFL star's murder cases, saying prosecutors lacked evidence.

Prosecutors countered that they can tie Hernandez to Lloyd's shooting and that the killing was part of a pattern of Hernandez committing acts of violence following nightclub disputes.

Also during the court hearing, Hernandez pleaded not guilty to charges that he attacked a handcuffed inmate and threatened to kill a guard and his family while at a county jail in Dartmouth.

Former New England Patriots NFL football player Aaron Hernandez's attorneys challenged the evidence in one of his murder cases, arguing at a pretrial hearing that prosecutors have not established probable cause

Hernandez faces murder charges in the June 17 slaying of Lloyd, a semi-pro football player, as well as a separate case in which he is accused of shooting two men in Boston from inside a SUV in 2012.

He has pleaded not guilty in each case and is being held without bail.

The former New England Patriot sat passively in a blue blazer and khaki dress pants as his attorneys argued that the charges in the Lloyd slaying should be dismissed.

Defense attorney James Sultan said the prosecution might be able to prove Hernandez was with Lloyd the night he was killed, but he argued that does not make Hernandez culpable.

'You can't throw a bunch of stuff at the wall. That's not probable cause,' Sultan said.

Prosecutors said their evidence includes a flurry of phone calls and text messages among those involved and the fact that Lloyd's body was found about 1,000 yards from Hernandez's home in North Attleborough, where Lloyd didn't know anybody but Hernandez.

Prosecutor William McCauley also said the state's investigation into incidents in Boston, Providence and Florida show a 'common pattern' of allegations of violence against Hernandez following disputes at nightclubs.

An associate of Hernandez, Alexander Bradley, has filed a lawsuit alleging that Hernandez shot him in the face in Florida after they argued at a strip club.

A tentative trial date of October 6 has been set in the Lloyd murder case. The judge did not immediately rule on the motion to dismiss the murder charge.

It remains to be seen who will defend him.

In May,Â  he made legal filings requesting Suffolk County court give him two months 'to make financial 
arrangements to retain counsel'.

WCVB reports his current attorneys may not be able to represent him all the way through settlement of the cases.

In their most recent court filing, Boston-based attorneys Charles Rankin and James Sultan said their representation was 'limited to 
arraignment only and related proceedings'.

Over three years in the NFL, Hernandez earned a reported $18 million.
