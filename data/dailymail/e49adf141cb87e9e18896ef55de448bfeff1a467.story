A computer hacker who famously stole nude photos from Paris Hilton’s cell phone and posted her contacts online has apologized some nine years after publicly embarrassing the socialite.

Cameron Lacroix, now 26, was just a teenager when he cracked Hilton’s T-Mobile account in 2005 in the first example of a celebrity’s phone being hacked.

Lacroix, who has spent the past 10 years carrying out a range of cyber-crimes, is attempting to put his house in order before he begins a four-year sentence in federal prison.

‘Paris, I’m sorry I put your information online,’ he told NBC News. ‘I should never have done it. I wouldn’t want it done to me.’

Along with embarrassing Hilton, Lacroix, from New Bedford, Massachusetts, also famously hacked Burger King’s Twitter account last year.

Along with these high profiles crimes, Lacroix has also hacked federal law enforcement databases, changed his community college grades and caused more than $1 million in damage to private firms.

Lacroix was just 16 in 2005 when he cracked the code to Hilton’s Sidekick phone.

Lacroix hacked into T-Mobile’s computer system and decided to check if there was a phone registered in Hilton’s name since she was advertising the Sidekick 

He had decided to hack into T-Mobile’s computer system because he wanted a free phone, but on realizing how easy it was he decided to check if there was a phone registered in Hilton’s name since she was advertising the product.

‘Sure enough, it was under her name. I went into it and was shocked at what I saw,’ he said.

Publishing Hilton’s phonebook and nude photos online made Lacroix feel good about himself.

‘I wanted to be a celebrity,' said the computer obsessive whose mom had died of a drug overdose when he was young and who had dropped out of high school, ‘it was mind-blowing for me. … I felt famous.’

But Lacroix also got noticed by federal officials and was soon serving 11 months in a federal juvenile facility for the Hilton hacking and other offences.

Over the next seven years he served several stretches inside and says that when he wasn’t in prison he was committing further cyber-crimes including steeling credit card numbers from online retailers.

Lacroix's other high profile hack happened in February 2013, when he gained access to Burger King’s Twitter account and changed the logo to McDonald's golden arches

Lacroix's other high profile hack happened in February 2013, when he gained access to Burger King’s Twitter account. 

He replaced the fast-food chain’s logo with McDonald’s golden arches and said that Burger King had been sold to its competitor because 'the Whopper flopped.'

In October he was sentenced to four years in federal prison and has vowed to go straight when he gets out of jail in 2018, by which time he will be 30. 

After his release, Lacroix plans to put his hacking skills to good use for the federal authorities and credit card companies that he has spent the past 10 years scamming. 

'I’ve caused a lot of harm. I’ve got to fix this,' he said.
