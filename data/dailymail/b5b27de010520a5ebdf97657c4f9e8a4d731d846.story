Magnus Pehrsson's last close encounter with an England international ended with Chris Waddle advising him to try American Football instead, so the Estonia boss will feel there is room for improvement.

Pehrsson joined Bradford on loan from Djurgardens in November 1996, with a plan to spend four months in Yorkshire playing in the second tier of English football but he played only once, in a 3-0 home defeat to Oldham, when he was replaced after an hour.

One moment stands out in his memory. 

‘I was playing in midfield with Chris Waddle, who was a bit older then but still a terrific player,’ said the 38-year-old Swede. ‘When we got this dangerous free-kick situation I was confident enough to tell him I should take it and he said: “Go on then son”. I kicked it 10 metres over and he did this field-goal sign, and was laughing when he said that I should try American Football.’

He was too polite to mention Waddle’s penalty in Italia 90, also launched into the sky.

Pehrsson, who previously managed Aalborg and Djurgardens, took control of Estonia at the end of last year and his first campaign started with an encouraging win at home to Slovenia.

But that upbeat mood was punctured by defeat in Lithuania on Thursday with Ken Kallaste sent off and therefore suspended on Sunday.

‘The World Cup was not what Englishmen expected or hoped for but they are at start of something new with young players with key roles,’ said Pehrsson.

‘It’s now a team with more pace. We have to be a compact unit and put out a perfect performance and then there is a chance.’
