Prime Minister David Cameron, pictured arriving at BBC Television Centre for the Andrew Marr Show, says he will cease benefits to 40,000 children who live in other European Union countries

Millions of pounds in child benefit paid to families living outside the UK will be axed under David Cameron’s plan to claw back powers from Brussels.

The Prime Minister insisted it was wrong that the British taxpayer is giving cash to 40,000 children who live elsewhere in the European Union.

He revealed stopping migrant workers in the UK from claiming child benefit for their offspring back home would be a key demand of his plans to renegotiate a fresh deal with the EU before staging an in-out referendum by 2017.

Under EU rules, the benefit has to be paid to European nationals who are working in Britain and paying National Insurance – even if their families are based abroad.

Here are around 24,000 families claiming for 40,000 children, with two-thirds of the children based in Poland.

Mr Cameron said: ‘I don’t think that is right and that is something I want to change.’

He warned stopping the export of benefits across the EU would ‘take time’ because a deal would need to be struck with other member states or wait for the new treaty he hopes to negotiate if he is still Prime Minister after the next election.

He told BBC1’s Andrew Marr show: ‘There are other European countries who like me think it’s wrong that someone from Poland who comes here, who works hard - and I am absolutely all in favour of that - but I don’t think we should be paying child benefit to their family back at home in Poland.

‘Now, to change that, you’ve either got to change it with other European countries at the moment, or potentially change it through the treaty change that I’ll be putting in place before the referendum we will hold on Britain’s membership of the EU by the end of 2017.’

Child benefit is paid at £20.30 a week for the first child and £13.40 for every other child.

Since last year families in the UK with one person earning more than £50,000 have had their child benefit cut, and removed altogether if one earner has a salary of more than £60,000.

Mr Cameron made clear that tackling immigration from Europe would also be a key demand of renegotiation talks.

Crackdown: Cameron said he wants to stop people getting paid less than the minimum wage

‘My job is to put in place proper controls so people can’t come here to claim benefits; to put in proper controls to investigate that people aren’t being paid less than the minimum wage; to make sure we deal with illegal immigrants; to make sure if people can’t sustain themselves, they are removed from our country. All those steps we’ll be taking.’

He said he wanted to change Britain’s relationship with the EU before putting it to a vote in an in-out referendum.

like me think it’s wrong that someone from Poland who comes here, who 
works hard - and I am absolutely all in favour of that - but I don’t 
think we should be paying child benefit to their family back at home in 
Poland'

He refused to say if he would campaign to leave the EU if he failed to secure enough concessions, insisting his renegotiation was ‘doable’.

‘We need flexibility, we need more competitiveness, we need less costs added to our small business, we need to fix all these things.’

But the PM came under fresh pressure to explain why he had not published a forecast for the number of Romanians and Bulgarians who will arrive this year after work restrictions were lifted.

‘We are not making a forecast because I think it is unlikely we would get that forecast right,’ the Prime Minister said.

But he defended moves to charge foreign nationals to use A&E departments on the NHS, denying it was to bureaucratic to be enforced.

He said: ‘We should do it. We can do it. Our NHS is a national treasure, we can all be incredibly proud of it and it’s right that we all pay into it and everyone here has access to it for free.

‘But people who come to our country, who don’t have the right to use it, should be charged for it, and we’re putting that in place.’

Mr Cameron's tough stance on EU immigration is seen as a response to the growing popularity of the UK Independence Party, which predicts it will win elections to the European Parliament in May.

UKIP leader Nigel Farage dismissed the Prime Minister's announcements as rhetoric designed to echo his own policies.

He wrote on Twitter: David Cameron seems to be trying to sound like me. But the thing is, I believe in what I say.'
