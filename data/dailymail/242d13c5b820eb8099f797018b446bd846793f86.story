Goodbye to the Lob, farewell to the Pob and anybody sporting a Frob had better start growing out that fringe fast. This autumn it's all about the Wob, or wavy bob.

Yes, after the long bob, the Posh (Victoria Beckham) bob and the fringed bob, the wavy bob is the only hairdo in town.

Queen of the wob brigade is Jennifer Lawrence, who grew out last year's pixie cut into the casual flicky style. Beyonce, Nicole Richie and Sienna Miller have gone for the chop - and every time I switch on Strictly I see Caroline Flack's wob bouncing across the dancefloor.

Going for the chop: Lydia with long locks and, right, her new carefree wavy bob

The name may be silly but the look is sizzling: youthful, edgy and seemingly low-maintenance, as messiness is the key to the wob's appeal. What's more, it is supposed to work on almost every face shape.

'The wob is carefree,' says Beverly Hills-based celebrity stylist Nelson Chan. 'The waviness brings out the sexiness in women.'

Well, it certainly looks lovely on Lawrence. But would it suit me, 20 years her senior at a ripe old 44, at least a stone heavier and with no hairstylist in my entourage?

I wasn't so sure. My hairdo isn't so much low-maintenance as no-maintenance. I don't even own a can of hairspray and the last time I visited the salon with a photograph, saying 'I want to look like her', it was the mid-Nineties and I was clutching a picture of Jennifer Aniston.

On me, the 'Rachel' was a disaster. I couldn't be bothered to style it properly, so it ended up more Rod Stewart.

I grew out the layers and since then I've kept my hair one length, usually just below the collarbone.

So maybe it was time for a style reboot, and perhaps a wob would be the answer. My ten-year-old daughter was solidly behind the idea.

But when I sat down in Jo Hansford's Mayfair salon, I found myself feeling wobbly. All around were chic-looking women with cascades of glossy hair - yet I was sacrificing my long locks for a short, deliberately scruffy bob. Was I insane?

Stylist Michaela Galvin was reassuring. 'It will definitely suit your face shape,' she said. But was I too old for such a trendy look? 'Oh no! We've had all sorts of people asking for them.'

Then she sliced through six inches of hair in a single snip and there was no going back.

A wob may look carefree but it's quite complicated to create. First Michaela snipped my hair off in a straight bob just below the chin. Then she set to work with thinning scissors to reduce the volume - a relief, as otherwise I could see myself with a triangular 'do' like Wendolene Ramsbottom, Wallace's love interest in A Close Shave.

'The problem is you've got about five times as much hair as Jennifer Lawrence,' Michaela explained.

Once my hair was lying closer to my face, she chopped into it at the bottom to add the required touch of shagginess. Finally she added a few romantic waves with curling tongs. 'Don't curl the hair right to the end,' she counselled. 'You want to leave a little flick out at the bottom, so it looks very casual.'

For the final touch she sprayed my hair with Shu Uemura's Art of Hair Texture Wave spray, which contains cottonseed oil for shine-free hold (glossiness is a no-no in a wob, apparently).

Et voila! Two hours later, I had the season's ultimate un-do.

Looking in the mirror, I was shocked to see air where I'd once had hair. But gradually I found myself warming to my wob. The casual waves added width to the top half of my face and made my eyes look wider and my jawline slimmer.

Less time on hair styling means more time on rehearsing: Strictly Come Dancing's Caroline Flack is another fan of the style

'Wow!' said my husband that night. My eldest daughter loved it too. 'It's epic!' she shrieked. The eight-year-old wasn't so sure. 'You look messy,' she said, fetching the hairbrush.

It was next morning that the wob's real benefits started to reveal themselves. I leapt out of bed, flung on my clothes and hustled the children off to school without bothering even to comb my bed-head. But as I crashed through the school gates, I had a smug conviction that this morning I looked chic rather than shabby.

Then I went to the gym and didn't get my hair caught in the machinery. My friends said I looked younger.

My wob wasn't too hard to style. That night, for a party, I re-did it using my sister's hair tongs to add the waves, then glued them in with L'Oreal's Tecni-Art Fix Anti-Frizz.

Not everyone liked the look. My mother was frankly puzzled. 'What does it mean?' she asked. And in truth, the style is not quite as easy to wear as its fans claim. A messy hairdo can look fabulously edgy with smoky eyes, glossy lips and a designer outfit, much less so with no make-up and yoga pants.

I've cut down on hair-brushing time in the mornings but have to spend extra minutes applying mascara and lipstick. That's a small price to pay, though, for never having a 'bad hair day'.

And the wob's real secret is that if you do need to look sophisticated, a few brush-strokes and a blast with the dryer can turn it into the sort of sleek bob even your mother would admire.
