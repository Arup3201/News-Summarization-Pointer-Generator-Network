Packets of peanuts were dished out as wedding confetti on Sunday as a couple tied the knot on an airplane.

Dottie Coven and Keith Stewart from Louisville, Kentucky, said 'I do' at 32,000 feet on a Southwest Airlines Boeing 737 jet from Nashville to Dallas Love Field.

They managed to secure 30 seats for family and friends with frequent flyer points they'd accumulated, while the 111 other guests were complete strangers.

Mr Stewart wrote a letter to Southwest Airlines and the wedding request was accepted.

The company chose its first non-stop, two-hour flight from Nashville to Dallas for the occasion.

For the Sunday afternoon flight the boarding area was transformed into a wedding reception hall with balloons surrounding the gate.

Refreshments were also served as a live band performed.

Continuing the flying theme, Ms Coven and Mr Stewart will be jetting off to Puerto Rico on their honeymoon courtesy of Southwest Airlines.

'A lot of things around flying tend to not be fun. Let's make it fun again!' Ms Coven concluded.
