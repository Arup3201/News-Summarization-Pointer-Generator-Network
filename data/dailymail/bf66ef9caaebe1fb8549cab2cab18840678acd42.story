At school I always bridled at teachers who referred to us as ‘young people’. Invariably they were icky groovers, smelling of toothpaste and piety. Yesterday the same rebellion rose in my gorge while watching a creepy Sky News-Facebook TV show that forced party leaders to matey up to selected yoofs.

Ed Miliband, Nick Clegg, David Cameron and that Aussie from the Greens took turns to be quizzed.

The programme, Stand Up And Be Counted (did they mean the ratings figures?), was all about ‘young people’ and their alleged indifference to electoral politics. The camera angles were look-at-me edgy, all wobbly with up-the-nose shots. Oh, please.

The late-teen/early 20s inquisitors, pretty plainly politics obsessives, soon had Mr Miliband in trouble by asking what ‘life experience’ he had to be PM. Odd Ed should have said ‘more than you, wonkface’ or ‘It’s the middle of the day, why aren’t you festering in your bed?’.

Instead he scrunched his lips and claimed, in that frogman-still-wearing-a-snorkel voice, that ‘ah’ve done a number of things’. He had been a Treasury spin doctor and had briefly taught (politics) at Harvard. That had given him ‘the ability, I hope, to engage and listen to people’.

Normal 20-somethings would have treated this lame answer to hog-whimpering derision and armfarts. The political trainspotters recruited by Sky heard it in respectful silence.

Mr Clegg, when his turn came, discarded his tie – hey, look, I’m a cool guy! – and went all glottal-stoppy and Northern English. His Pied Piper of Hamlyn act was embarrassing, belittling, wet – just like the programme.

Public school-educated Cleggy started saying ‘coontry’ instead of ‘country’, ‘loonchtime’ instead of ‘lunchtime’. We had ‘kindof’ this and ‘kinda’ that, and he gave his sentences a California-surfer uplift. What a fraud. Yet the credulous boobies fell for it. Thus is our politics infantilised.

Enter David Cameron. At least he and Ed Mil’ kept their ties on. He was asked what he thought about Prime Minister’s Questions (one of the so-called youngsters, who actually looked quite middle-aged, trotted out the Establishment view that rowdiness in the Commons is disgraceful).

Mr Cameron was also asked about the price of tampons. The show was fronted by Sky’s political editor, one Faisal Islam. Amazing to think this chump is successor to the serious, worldly Adam Boulton. In his shiny suit, the twinkly-eyed Islam could have been an under-manager at a boutique hotel. He kept mewing about what ‘young people’ were interested in.

To keep the little darlings interested, the producers had laid on ping-pong, table football, a sweetie stall. Islam’s co-presenter Jayne Secker showed us these and even announced that there was ‘a break-out zone, as young people call it’. After the show Islam and Secker repeatedly told us how ‘extraordinary’ the programme had been. Right! The Greens’ Natalie Bennett, in her session, announced she wanted ‘peaceful political revolution’.

Given that this involved encouraging more immigration and scrapping council tenants’ right-to-buy, it was open to question how peaceful such a revolution could be.

But her views went little challenged. Ms Bennett said she had been a feminist since the age of five. Haven’t we all, dear? There was no sign of Ukip’s Nigel Farage. Apparently he was in Europe. Perhaps he had spotted a stitch-up in the offing.

Instead it was Ed Miliband who was kippered, and not just with that excruciating piffle about his ‘life experience’.

After his main session, he was pursued by a scruffy Sky hack who in a selfie-stick interview asked what Ed had done when he was 18.

Our hero said he had been just like any other teenager, really: he had lived in New York with his Marxist-historian father, had ‘cared a lot about the world, been very interested in British politics and global issues’ – and had ‘drunk a bit too much’.

Do we believe him? Is the problem with Ed Miliband not that, rather like the eggheads assembled at yesterday’s patronising Sky/Facebook stunt, he has perhaps never drunk quite enough?
