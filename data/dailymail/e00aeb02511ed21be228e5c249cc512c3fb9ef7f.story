Carson Tinker knows a thing or two about triumph. He wrote a book about getting over adversity, too.

Before joining the NFL’s Jacksonville Jaguars, Tinker was in the midst of a hugely successful college career with Alabama before his life was one of many to change on April 27, 2011.

As tornadoes devastated the Yellowhammer State, fifty two people perished in Tuscaloosa. One of them was Tinker’s girlfriend, Ashley Harrison.

‘Tornadoes come like spur of the moment; you don’t really have a lot of time to prepare,’ the 24-year-old long snapper recalled.

Carson Tinker does not wish to be defined by the 2011 tragedy and has forged a career in the NFL

‘We were watching the weather. They said it was coming and my room-mate and I went outside and we looked for it, but it was behind us so we couldn’t see it. My grandfather called and said we need to take shelter, so we took shelter in the property. About 30 seconds later it hit the house.’

In a closet alongside two of his room-mates, Tinker cuddled and reassured Ashley that everything would be OK. But winds of 190mph shredded the house, ripping it from its foundations.

The twister threw him 50 feet, and while both his friends survived, when he woke in hospital the next morning, he discovered the devastating news.

‘You’re not defined by what you go through. You’re defined by how you respond. And that’s how I want to be defined.

‘And the circumstance of the tornado, suffering loss and being injured, my vision was to play football and three years later, I’m playing football in the NFL. And I think it’s really cool how far I’ve come.

‘Football has given me a really unique platform to be able to encourage people and inspire, challenge and motivate and not only in America, but now in London,’ he said before the Jaguars’ game against the Dallas Cowboys at Wembley on Sunday.

Tinker suffered a broken wrist, severe concussion and an injury to his ankle which required a radical new technique from Dr Michael Beckenstein.

‘I got a skin graft from a cadaver. That’s not my real skin on there,’ Tinker says, pointing to a not unsubstantial scar near his right ankle, ‘that’s somebody else’s skin. It’s a pretty new procedure.

‘He did the skin draft in the locker room after one of our college games. It was able to heal in the middle of the football season, under the most hostile conditions. They tried it on a few hundred people and mine was one of the only ones that worked.’

Swept away by the love and support of his college and the community, the inspirational Tinker helped to rebuild a town which had seen nearly 2,500 homes damaged by a deadly mile-wide trail of destruction.

He became a household name in America and was named as a finalist for Sports Illustrated’s Sportsperson of the Year award in 2011.

After 18 months of reflection, he released a book in May (A Season to Remember: Faith in the Midst of the Storm), about the aftermath of the tornado and the Crimson Tide’s championship-winning season. All proceeds go to his charity, the Be A Blessing foundation, which helps those who have suffered loss or hardship.

‘I thought it was an opportunity to help people and to inspire people and my mantra has been some people ask for blessings, but I ask that I can be a blessing, and that’s what I wanted to do with the book.

‘I definitely wouldn’t be where I am today if it wasn’t for my family and my friends, my team-mates and the rehab staff at Alabama College. That’s another reason why I wanted to give back to them because they lifted me up when I needed it most. I can’t thank them enough.’

A deeply religious man, Tinker draws strength from his faith and also from his parents, who have both survived cancer.

‘My mum when I was in third grade and my dad when I was in eighth grade. Just growing up and having them as role models and being able to watch them face adversity and how they handled it. Actions speak louder than words.’

Which is clearly a mantra that  Tinker lives by.
