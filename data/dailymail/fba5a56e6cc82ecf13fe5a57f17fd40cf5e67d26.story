FA chairman Greg Dyke will continue to be hounded by FIFA for the return of his £16,000 Parmigiani watch despite the resignation of ethics investigator Michael Garcia, who had pursued him over the matter.

FIFA sources have indicated Dyke is believed to be the only one of the 65 international delegates at the FIFA Congress in Sao Paulo in the summer who received watches from the Brazilian Football Federation not to have returned it to Zurich after Garcia ruled the cost of the gifts breached the ethics code.

Dyke’s watch is now with the FA-designated charity Breast Cancer Care after the chairman preferred to pay £3,000 in import duty and auction it for the charity despite correspondence with Garcia in which disciplinary action was threatened if the watch was not given back.

Bizarrely, considering the mess FIFA are in following Garcia’s departure, the case of Dyke’s watch has been handed over to compliance chief Domenico Scala, who has the more pressing matter on Friday of deciding how much of Garcia’s report on World Cup bid corruption can be shared with the FIFA executive.

FIFA want Dyke to send the watch to Zurich, where it would have been sold to benefit a Brazilian charity. Or they said Dyke could have kept it among the many gifts the FA receive.

Meanwhile, UEFA president Michel Platini has had a change of heart and returned his watch, after first saying he would be keeping it to give away himself since he never returns presents.

FIFA’S anger at American lawyer Michael Garcia causing such turmoil with his complaints about colleagues, followed by his resignation from his ethics committee investigative role, is compounded by the fact they paid him $6million for his work.

Only the elitist MCC in their online ballot for Lord’s tickets for the Ashes Test next summer could have a drop-down list of titles that includes not just the usual Mr, Mrs or Miss, but the following: Baron, Brigadier, Count, Earl, His and Her Royal Highness, Judge, Lord, Prince, Queen, Sir, Viscount and Wing Commander.

An MCC spokesman said the options cover all their upmarket membership.

The interminable sports awards season reached a new low on Thursday when Match of the Day magazine’s interview of the year went to their own chat with Xavi.

A spokesman refused to comment on the in-house triumph. 

African football confederation president Issa Hayatou ordered the BBC and the rest of the media to be ejected from the FIFA executive’s hotel in Marrakech after being ambushed by Beeb cameras in the lobby of the five-star La Mamounia.

Hayatou has had a deep hatred of the BCC since a 2010 Panorama documentary alleged he had taken bribes from FIFA’s former marketing partners, ISL. Hayatou insisted the 100,000 French francs benefited the confederation.

Hayatou complained to the hotel management when he found out it was the BBC who were filming and asking him valid questions — and on Thursday there was a ring of steel around La Mamounia.

England Supporters Travel Club have put aside their dispute with the FA over changing the loyalty points system ahead of Euro 2016 (attendance at Wembley now accrues twice the points gained from away games) by taking a football team to Belgium for a Christmas Truce match against Germany. 

But no such peace and goodwill from Garford Beck, team manager of England fans, who is making an official complaint to Police Scotland about the England band providing musical accompaniment for anti-IRA chanting during the recent international friendly at Celtic Park.

The England Cricket Board is carrying out a cull of its older officials: the only member of the commercial department being asked to re-apply for his job is over 50.

Ironically, 67-year-old Colin Graves of Yorkshire, who is behind the pro-youth reforms, will become the oldest ever chairman of the board when he succeeds Giles Clarke in the new year.
