Millions of families face a double-digit increase in the cost of gas  and electricity after EDF became  the latest energy supplier to announce a price hike.

The firm – which has 5.5million  customers and is the country’s biggest electricity supplier – is raising tariffs by an average 10.8 per cent.

It means the annual bill for a dual fuel customer who pays via monthly direct debit will be £1,252 – an increase of £123.

Heating up: EDF Energy is pushing up gas and electricity bills for customers by nearly 11 per cent from December 7. It is the fifth of the 'big six' energy firms to impose a price rise this winter.

EDF
is the fifth of the ‘big six’ energy firms to raise tariffs in the last
few weeks. The sixth, E.ON, is expected to follow suit in January.

The companies have blamed Government policies for the rise in prices, 
including requirements to pay for a switch to green and nuclear energy, 
and funding the insulation of cold homes.

Earlier this month, David Cameron told suppliers he intends to bring  in
legislation forcing them to offer customers the cheapest tariff.

Currently, 75 per cent of households are on their supplier’s most 
expensive scheme, with 60 per cent admitting to having never switched 
firms in the past 15 years.

Downing Street yesterday confirmed the law will be changed to force firms to charge a fair price.
Audrey Gallacher, energy expert at customer group Consumer Focus, said: 
‘Another price rise, hot on  the heels of those we’ve already seen, will
again feed into consumer concerns on pack behaviour and whether price 
changes are driven by real supply and demand issues.’

EDF's 10.8 per cent hike,
which will affect three million customers from December 7, is due to rising cost of distribution, efficiency,
buying energy and wholesale prices.

EDF director Martin Lawrence said: 'We know that customers will not welcome this news and do not want to see prices going up.

'Our
new prices will however be cheaper on average than those of all the 
other major suppliers which have announced standard price rises so far 
this autumn.'

Rising bills: EDF's price rise, announced ahead of winter, will add £120 per year to household bills, affecting 3 million customers

Mr Lawrence also
added that it is the first supplier to automatically switch vulnerable
customers, for example those receiving pension credits, to its cheapest tariff,
benefitting 85,000 customers.

A nine per cent
rise from Scottish and Southern Energy (SSE) started earlier this month,
while price increases from Scottish Power, British Gas and nPower will hit
customer bills before the end of the year. 

The EDF hike
is the biggest percentage rise, so far, this year – however, a spokesman said
that its average price is still cheapest average tariff, even after the increase.

It brings an EDF
annual duel fuel direct debit bill to an average of £1,251, just £7 cheaper
than its nearest rival nPower which will charge customers £1,258 annually, after
its rise.

Audrey Gallacher, from Consumer Focus, said: 'The latest energy price rise will leave even more customers worried about their energy bills.

'EDF Energy’s tariffs will still be slightly cheaper on average than other suppliers who have increased their prices – but this will be little comfort to those seeing a double-digit percentage rise on their bills.'

The
news will come as a blow to millions of households who have little 
escape from energy price rises this winter just as the cold weather 
hits.

Ann
Robinson, from uSwitch.com, said: 'This is the final hammer blow for 
energy bills this side of Christmas. Consumers now face a winter of 
rationing their energy usage - many will be forced to turned their 
heating down or off for fear of the impact of these hikes.'

How much? How EDF Energy compares in the average duel fuel bill price league after the hike

Mark Todd, from Energyhelpline.com, said: 'The
energy price rise domino effect is in full swing, and we expect E.ON to
make their announcement soon for price increases in the New Year.'

EDF Energy
said that the rise is due to sharp increases in its costs since the start of the
year, with distribution charges going up by 9 per cent and energy efficiency
schemes increasing by more than 50 per cent.

A spokesman
also said that the cost of buying energy had gone up by 4 per cent, a fee which
makes up around 50 per cent of the typical gas and electricity bill.

Gary Hornby, an energy analyst at Inenco, said the current price rises were just the start, with further increases in bills expected next year.

He said: 'Wholesale gas and power prices have risen by approximately 8 per cent since the lows seen in June, and investment in cleaner forms of generation is still costly and these increases were always going to be passed onto the consumer.

'These rises come at a time when household budgets are already stretched and, despite the positive GDP figures released yesterday, the UK economy continues to struggle.

'In addition, more gas will be needed as a fuel for power generation from 2013 onwards with older, more pollutant coal power stations coming offline due to emission regulations.

'As gas burn is much more expensive than coal burn currently, the recent spate of price rises could be in anticipation of higher wholesale prices in the future.'
