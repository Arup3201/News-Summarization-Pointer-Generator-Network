Tyler Vallance, 21, has been jailed for nine years for killing his 12-week-old daughter Isabella (pictured)

A father has been jailed for nine years for killing his 12-week old baby after shaking her so violently that she suffered catastrophic brain injuries. 

Tyler Vallance, 21, described as a 'violent and unpredictable man', left his daughter Isabella 'effectively dead' after carrying out the 'extremely violent assault' in Bromsgrove, Worcestershire in November 2012.

The court heard how Vallance twisted Isabella's legs in such a violent way that she sustained fractures to both, as well as eight broken ribs.

He then gripped and shook her, causing her to lose consciousness while still in his arms.

The little girl -  who had successfully overcome a premature birth at 34 weeks - died five days later.

Vallance had previously pleaded guilty to the manslaughter of his daughter Isabella. 

Today, at Worcester Crown Court, he was also sentenced to 18 months to run concurrently after pleading guilty to inflicting grievous bodily harm in an earlier attack on Isabella months earlier.

The child's mother Jessica Wiggins, 20, from Redditch, was also sentenced to nine months in jail, suspended for 12 months. She was convicted of allowing Isabella's death at the hands of her ex-partner.

Sentencing, Judge Juckes said Vallance was a 'violent and unpredictable' man, who had issues with anger management and ADHD, for which he took medication. 

Addressing the defendant, he said: 'What undoubtedly, Tyler, you had done in that moment was to twist Isabella's legs in such a way so violently as to fracture the left femur and right tibia, gripping and shaking her so violently you caused catastrophic brain injury so that bleeding began and led to her very quickly losing consciousness.

'It was an extremely violent assault, from which she never recovered.'

He added that Vallance 'must have been aware how badly' he hurt his daughter.

During the hearing, the court heard how Isabella's injuries were so serious that the first paramedic on the scene described her as looking 'completely dead and lifeless'.

The court heard how Vallance also 'knew immediately' what he had to his daughter, but offered no indication as to what had happened.

It was only after Isabella's death that a post mortem discovered the tell-tale internal injuries he had inflicted on the vulnerable baby on that occasion.

He later sought to blame Wiggins' parents for the initial attack, the court was told.

Judge Juckes said Isabella was 'a baby who had been fine, and in many ways thriving' but had 'suddenly collapsed'.

The judge praised the medical care at both the Alexandra Hospital, Redditch, and later Birmingham Children's Hospital as swift and professional.

But he said that, from the moment of Vallance's violent outburst, his daughter had been left 'effectively dead' and nothing could be done to save her.

Life support for the little girl was withdrawn and she died five days later. 

The judge added that violent assault was the result of a 'sudden extreme loss of temper', but whether born of 'anger or exasperation' there was still intent to cause harm.

Judge Juckes also said he accepted that Wiggins, who the court heard raised her own siblings, was 'a good mother'.

He accepted evidence in court from both social and healthcare workers that she was 'skilled' and competent.

Isabella's mother Jessica Wiggins (pictured with Isabella) was also handed a nine-month jail term, suspended for 12 months, for allowing the death of her daughter

But he said he could not square the 'truly remarkable imbalance' of her fine ability as a mother with her apparent failure to share concerns about Vallance with the hospital doctors and police.

It was only when a friend in whom Wiggins had confided threatened to tell police about her suspicion Vallance had carried out the fatal attack, that she 'hinted' her fears to police, the court heard.

Judge Juckes told Wiggins: 'At the heart of what is worse is what you did throughout what followed (the fatal assault). You lied to doctors and police about what you knew or suspected.' 

Vallance, who also has a mild form of Tourette's, had sat impassively as the judge spoke. As his sentence was passed down he started chewing the inside of his mouth and looked across at Wiggins.

Yesterday in court, Vallance was described by the prosecution as a manipulative man who had threatened Wiggins with suicide if she ever left him.

The court heard Vallance (pictured left and right), who pleaded guilty to manslaughter, 'knew immediately' what he had done to his daughter but did not reveal any information to paramedics or police

In evidence, the court heard how he had attacked her in public on at least two occasions, once grabbing her throat and hair in front of friends.

QC for the Crown Christopher Hotton said Vallance 'had little or no part' in the care of his baby girl, adding 'it is clear Jessica Wiggins did not trust Tyler Vallance with the care of Isabella'.

He spoke of a text Wiggins had sent a friend in which she described an incident at the family home where Vallance had nearly accidentally struck his daughter.

Mr Hotton said the young couple's relationship was stormy and they had once broken up, before being reconciled when Wiggins learned she was pregnant with Isabella.

The judge said it seemed clear Isabella 'did not take to her father'. He also made it clear that health and social workers, as well as Vallance's relatives, had done everything to offer support to the young family.

He added that it was an aggravating factor that the attack happened 'in spite of and in the face of' that assistance.

Neighbours reported hearing a row in the family home on the morning of the fatal assault. A later one-second phone call made to 999 from Wiggins' phone was never explained by either parent. tje coirt was told. 

It was an hour-and-a-half after that phone call that Wiggins rang for an ambulance, saying her baby had suddenly collapsed.

The judge accepted from hearing the call's recording, she was 'plainly a mother in real distress'. 

Judge Juckes said a letter of apology from Vallance expressed his 'sense of loss', but needed to be weighed against another letter he had written to a female girlfriend while in prison in which he had attempted to shift the blame for the killing onto others.

Vallance was convicted in August last year of sexual activity with a 14-year-old girl, and of causing a child to engage in sexual activity, for which he was sentenced to six months in custody.
