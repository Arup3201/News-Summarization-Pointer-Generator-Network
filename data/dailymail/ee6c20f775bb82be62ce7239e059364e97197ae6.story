Chris Froome leads a British team full of options for the Road World Championships in Spain later this month.

Froome, the 2013 Tour de France winner and runner-up in the Vuelta a Espana which finished on Sunday, is joined in the nine-man squad by Commonwealth Games champion Geraint Thomas, British champion Pete Kennaugh and David Millar, who will be racing for the final time in a Great Britain jersey before retiring at the end of the season.

Also in the squad for the men's road race on September 28, the final day of the World Championships in Ponferrada, are Steve Cummings, Luke Rowe, the Yates twins Simon and Adam and Ben Swift, who is another who could be a protected rider for if the race ends in a sprint.

Sir Bradley Wiggins, as expected, is named only for the time-trial, which takes place on September 24, alongside Commonwealth Games champion Alex Dowsett.

It means Wiggins, the 2012 Tour de France winner, and Froome will not have raced together since last year's World Championships in Florence, when not a single Briton finished in a desperate showing.

The pair have not raced in the same Team Sky squad since the Tour of Oman in February 2013 amid suggestions of a feud dating to the 2012 Tour.

Wiggins, who is currently negotiating a new deal with Team Sky, is turning his attentions to the track for the Rio de Janeiro Olympics.

Sir Dave Brailsford, the Team Sky principal who resigned as British Cycling performance director in April, is overseeing the squad as British Cycling technical director Shane Sutton concentrates on the build-up to the track season.

Lizzie Armitstead leads the six-rider women's squad, which also includes two-time junior world champion Lucy Garner.

Hannah Barnes, Anna Christian and mountain bike riders Annie Last and Alice Barnes complete the line-up. Hannah and Alice Barnes are sisters.

There is no entrant in the women's time-trial following Emma Pooley's retirement as it is not believed anyone has medal potential.

Sutton said: 'I'm pleased with the teams we've selected for the UCI Road World Championships. Across the board, we have some real podium contenders.

'Sir Brad showed great form at the Tour of Britain this year, winning the time-trial stage, and of course Alex did a fantastic ride to win the time trial at the Commonwealth Games so it will be interesting to see how they get on.

'Fellow Commonwealth Games champion Lizzie Armitstead has a great team around her including two mountain bikers who should be able to support her on the reasonably hilly course.

'For the men's road race, Chris proved he's in good shape by coming second at the Vuelta and I'm pleased David Millar will be leading the team in his last outing in Great Britain kit.'

- Men's elite time-trial: Alex Dowsett, Sir Bradley Wiggins.
