No-one will linger long over this. At some point on Thursday morning it will be gone, expunged from the memory, all thoughts turning to a significant European Championship qualifier with Gibraltar on Sunday.

For both nations this was what it was. An improving Northern Ireland have their own qualifier against Finland and, like the Scots, had an eye on the bigger prize. 

The 85th-minute corner from debutant Matt Ritchie which placed the ball onto the head of goalscoring substitute Christophe Berra salvaged the night from irrelevance.

A captain’s performance from Darren Fletcher was also worthy of note. Throw in some decent runs and crosses from Derby left back Craig Forsyth in his first start and Gordon Strachan will take value from this. 

With Ikechi Anya, the enigmatic Watford winger who tried his utmost to enliven a comatose friendly, there was evidence of a promising new line of attack.

Yet the truth is this. It was no night for snap judgments. Strachan fiddled with his resources, never really fielding anything resembling his strongest first 11. At times this was a stark reminder of why the Home International Championships are now a distant, mothballed relic.

‘I thought it was important to win this game,’ said the Scotland boss. ‘Just to make us feel good about ourselves. The performance was good at times. We got used to the pitch as well - which is a bit slick. Northern Ireland have improved immensely over the last year, beating Hungary and Greece.’

They never threatened a repeat.

Their boss Michael O’Neill, an old face on the Scottish scene, said: ‘For us I thought there were more positive than negatives. But we didn’t get enough good balls in the box. We left a lot of our first-choice players out, seven or eight of our players that will probably start on Sunday [against Finland].’

Berra’s breakthrough came in his first appearance for his country since November 2013. It came late, as people crept towards the exits, resigning themselves to a mediocre scoreless draw. 

The Ipswich defender’s header from the penalty spot crept through a ruck of bodies and into the net via the inside of the post.

It was a reward Scotland just about deserved. They had given it a go in the opening half, but looked to have run out of ideas after a raft of substitutions. 

Thank goodness for Anya, a cult figure amongst the Tartan Army, who brings an energy and industry to his work. Even on nights like this. Nights when, bluntly, others can’t quite find their game.

Reared a mile or so from Hampden his endeavour and tempo kept things interesting when an unspecified crowd estimated at less than 30,000 allowed their minds to drift towards the latest plot on Coronation Street.

Anya was at the heart of the first major chance in just four minutes, scurrying down the left flank and playing a one-two with Forsyth. A sharp cut-back was turned towards goal at the second attempt, Northern Ireland keeper Michael McGovern – also Hamilton’s keeper – producing a terrific save to push the ball over the bar.

The early touch gave the keeper confidence. He would need it as Anya embarked on a one-man war of attrition. The little winger, whose goal in Germany last September has already become an iconic moment, was hellbent on adding to his tally.

He smashed a low right-foot shot from 20 yards in nine minutes. Scuttled forward and hit one wide with his right in 20. Then wasted a great chance after James McArthur nicked the ball off the toe of Chris Baird and teed him up two minutes later, thumping past the post again.

It took half an hour for another Scotland player to have a crack on goal, Steven Fletcher’s low shot from 18 yards taken comfortably by McGovern.

Five years have passed since Fletcher, Sunderland’s £14million man, last scored for his country. The only strike in 19 appearances for a player people screamed for during the infamous Craig Levein spat.

No-one remembers the goal – in a 2-1 World Cup qualifying win over Iceland in April 2009. Instead they remember Barry Ferguson’s V-sign to photographers or goalkeeper Allan McGregor’s smirk in the aftermath of the infamous Boozegate episode. A Steven Fletcher goal celebration in a Scotland shirt is now a solitary event.

He had another chance to change that before half-time, making the run to take a Maloney pass and trying to dink a shot over McGovern. To his credit the Irish keeper – an old hand around these parts – would not be beaten. Fletcher lasted an hour before accepting that this, once more, would not be his night for a goal.

The substitutions are a necessary nuisance in these games. Keen to try as many players out as possible before Sunday, Strachan made plenty.

Steven Naismith and, critically, Berra joined McGregor as half-time replacements, the Hull City No1 replacing Celtic’s Craig Gordon. On the hour mark, James Morrison and Jordan Rhodes – Fletcher’s replacement - were also handed a half hour to turn things around.

For Northern Ireland, the arrival of the mercurial Paddy McCourt - scorer of extraordinary goals for Celtic - and former Rangers skipper Steven Davis also raised interest levels.

For Matt Ritchie, it was a tentative, but promising debut. He ran around a lot and showed sharpness, and almost made the decisive impact in 69 minutes – taking a neat lay off from Naismith and thrashing a long-range shot a couple of yards wide.

With the best assist record in English football, he also takes a decent corner. A swirling inswinging ball picked out Naismith for a firm header which hit the target, but failed to seriously trouble the confident figure of McGovern.

Ritchie had better luck with his delivery from a corner five minutes from time when Berra claimed his third goal for Scotland. And just when Northern Ireland boss O’Neill thought his young, inexperienced side had come through the game unscathed.

Against a Gibraltar team who have shipped 21 goals in four qualifiers, O’Neill expects Scotland to do likewise.

‘There is a lot more depth in the Scotland squad at this moment in time,’ he said. ‘They moved the ball well and looked strong and powerful. Anya, in the first 15 or 20 minutes, caused us problems. I don’t anticipate Gibraltar will give you too many problems. I certainly hope not.’

In that regard he probably spoke for a nation.
