'Without warning': Bodybuilder Dale Burns was Tasered four times in less than a minute by police as they struggled to arrest him

A bodybuilder died after being stunned by a Taser four times in the space of a minute as police tried to arrest him.

Dale Burns, 27, suffered a fatal heart attack just over an hour after officers zapped him with the electric shock gun ‘without warning’, an inquest jury heard.

The taxi driver was also hit with pepper spray while officers held him down and put on handcuffs and leg restraints.

The court was told the father-of-two had taken illegal stimulant drugs before eight police arrived at his rented flat in Barrow-in-Furness, Cumbria, following a report that he had damaged a bathroom and was in an agitated state.

When Mr Burns advanced towards one of the officers – PC Kevin Milby, who had an X26 Taser – he was stunned four times in just 52 seconds, the court heard.

Coroner Alan Sharp said: ‘Dale’s behaviour became more agitated and aggressive.

'He started to throw articles about the room and objects out of the window. There was a risk to passers-by.’

He said after Mr Burns threw a glass out of the window he began to approach PC Milby ‘his eyes rolling to the back of his head and his fists clenched’.

‘He was fearful he would be attacked and feared for his own safety,’ said Mr Sharp. ‘The officer stated that there was simply no time to issue a warning.

‘Barbs lodged in the skin of Dale’s torso, and he received five seconds of electrical charge.’

Mr Burns fell back and knocked his head on his television cabinet, but the shock failed to stop his resistance so three seconds later the officer shocked him again.

Pepper spray was then used on Mr Burns before the third shock, 23 seconds later, and then a fourth nine seconds later.

Yesterday’s hearing at Kendal County Hall heard Mr Burns had taken the illegal stimulant drug MDPV before the incident, which is similar to speed.

'Gentle giant with a drug habit': Lisa Wilson (right), Mr Burns's former partner and mother of his two children, said he would take pills and inject anabolic steroids as part of his bodybuilding regime, a sport he started to become interested in when he was just 13, his mother Donna Rodden (left) told the inquest

Distressing: At Mr Burns's hearing the jury had to watch distressing CCTV footage of a wild-eyed, semi-naked and agitated Mr Burns, pictured with daughter Honour, in the police van after his arrest for criminal damage

After the shocks were administered, 
he was carried downstairs and into the police van, where CCTV footage 
showed him naked and struggling.

He was driven to Furness General Hospital and was administered with diazepam which sedated him.

However, a short while later he suffered a cardiac arrest.

Mr Sharp told the jury the drugs were
‘the primary initiating cause’ of Mr Burns’ death, but there was some 
disagreement as to whether the use of the Taser and other restraint 
techniques played a part.

'General dissatisfaction': Mr Burns, pictured with son Ethan and daughter Honour, began to suffer from depression from 2009 onwards, his mother said

The X26 Taser transmits up to 50,000 volts and uses compressed air to fire two electric barbs at a target at up to 21 feet.

If the Taser shocks are found to be 
responsible or partially responsible for Mr Burns’ death, it is thought 
he would have been the first person in Britain to die in such a way.

The hearing was told Mr Burns worked in railway maintenance for Network Rail, and also as a nightclub bouncer and a taxi driver.

He had a daughter, Honour, now five, with his ex-girlfriend Lisa Wilson and a son, Ethan, now three, with partner Sarah Keverne.

Miss Wilson agreed with the 
description of Mr Burns as a ‘gentle giant with a drug habit’, adding 
that he was ‘never aggressive’.

His mother Donna Rodden added: ‘Dale 
was a big bundle of fun. He was a big gentleman who loved everybody and 
wanted to be loved back.’

He developed an interest in 
bodybuilding at the age of 13 and won several medals, later taking 
steroids as an adult to boost his performance.

But he also suffered from depression and began taking recreational drugs including cocaine, ecstasy and cannabis.

The inquest continues.
