Under fire: Maria Miller's political career could be harmed by a ruling over her expenses

Maria Miller’s political future was in doubt last night after expenses watchdogs found fault with the Culture Secretary’s £90,000 claims on a second home.

This newspaper has learnt Mrs Miller is to be criticised by parliamentary standards officials over claiming the taxpayer-funded allowances on a home where her parents also lived.

The move has sparked a row at Westminster, with some Tory MPs outraged at the report.

It comes amid speculation that David Cameron is seeking to promote more women to his frontbench team as well as hold on to the female Ministers he already has.

But last night, one Tory MP privately admitted that criticism over her expenses could make Mrs Miller’s position in the Cabinet ‘untenable’.

The former marketing executive, 49, has been under investigation for the past year over second-home allowances claims between 2005 and 2009.

Mrs Miller claimed for a ‘second home’ mortgage and costs on the London home where her parents and family lived – not on two properties she rented in her Basingstoke constituency over the same period.

The case has drawn comparisons with the case of ex-Labour MP Tony McNulty, who had to repay almost £14,000 in second-home expenses after it emerged he was claiming for a constituency property where his parents lived rent-free.

However, Mrs Miller has repeatedly maintained her claims were ‘entirely above board’, insisting they had been ‘audited twice independently’.

But The Mail on Sunday understands the Commons’ Standards Committee, which rules on MPs’ conduct, has been advised that for at least part of the four years, Mrs Miller should not have claimed second-home costs for her London home.

Sources said a report to MPs by Parliamentary Standards Commissioner Kathryn Hudson concluded Mrs Miller should have nominated her rented  Basingstoke home as her second home. But when the report  was delivered to the Standards Committee two weeks ago, it sparked a furious row.

Claims: The dispute centres around expenses payments for Mrs Miller's London home while she was also renting properties in her Basingstoke constituency, including this barn

A source said ‘many Tories don’t agree with Hudson’s view’ and hinted they want to avoid Miller suffering a damning verdict in the committee’s final report.

Another source said: ‘The commissioner is arguing that as Mrs Miller owned the London property, that really was her main home and she’s sticking to her guns.’

However, the source suggested that Ms Hudson, who became standards commissioner over a year ago, may have got the expenses rules wrong.

The source predicted that Miller would get ‘a rap on the knuckles’ but could escape the humiliation of being asked to repay any money.

Last night, Mrs Miller declined to comment. But sources close to the Culture Secretary said she had sent in a full rebuttal of the commissioner’s conclusion.

Friends of Mrs Miller said: ‘We’ve always been clear that Maria’s expenses are entirely above board. She is co-operating with the Standards Committee inquiry and she will wait for its conclusion.’

Ms Hudson’s office said her report had now been sent to the committee but refused to comment on its contents.
