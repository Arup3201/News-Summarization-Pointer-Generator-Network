Thibaut Courtois must become Jose Mourinho's first-choice goalkeeper at Chelsea if he wants to continue as Belgium No 1, national team coach Marc Wilmots has warned.

The 22-year-old has established himself as one of the world's leading goalkeeper after winning La Liga while on loan at Atletico Madrid last season but he is now back in West London and fighting with Petr Cech for a starting place.

But despite choosing Courtois as Belgium's stopper for the World Cup in Brazil, Wilmot has declared that the Chelsea man is not assured of his place if he cannot break into his club side.

No 1? Thibaut Courtois must be Chelsea's first choice to remain as Belgium's stopper, says Marc Wilmots

No guarantees: Belgium coach Wilmots will consider dropping Courtois if he does not play regularly at Chelsea

Competition: Petr Cech is also vying to be Chelsea's top dog in goal ahead of their Premier League opener

Big decision: Jose Mourinho will have to decide which man to select for their Premier League season opener

Speaking in The Sun, Wilmots said: 'Courtois will remain my No 1. But I know he could end up on the bench at Chelsea.

'In that case I will re-assess.'

Despite playing the full 90 minutes of Chelsea's 2-0 victory over Real Sociedad at Stamford Bridge on Tuesday, Courtois is not assured of his place in Mourinho's side.

When asked about who would be between the sticks come the Blues' Premier League opener with Burnley on Monday, Mourinho was non-committal.

He said: 'The fact he played (against Sociedad) does not say that he is my first choice for Monday against Burnley.' 

Warm welcome: Courtois was introduced to a rapturous applause at Stamford Bridge on Tuesday evening

Pedigree: Courtois won La Liga with Atletico Madrid last season and established himself as a top goalkeeper
