For those interested in seeing what really goes on at the annual Burning Man festival - but who don't want to spend a week in the remote Nevada desert - this video offers the perfect insight.

The incredible drone footage -filmed high above Black Rock Desert - reveals what really happens at the festival, which this year saw nearly 70,000 people attend.

With wide scenic shots show a hive of revellers having fun as well as the festival's effigy - a large statue of a man - being set on fire at the conclusion of the week-long rave.

Welcome to the playa! Black Rock City is the week-long festival's pop-up, self-contained community 

There were dust storms and extreme weather conditions during last week's Caravansary-themed celebration in Black Rock City: the self-contained community that is both built and dismantled during the festival.

Money is banned for the duration of the quirky art and music festival 110 miles north of Reno.

And revellers must bring all food, water and other necessities required for their extended stay.

The festival's effigy is meant to be a symbol of catharsis, reflection and new beginnings for participants.

The drone footage, captured high above the remote desert, captured images during the day and evening of quirky art installations, the sprawling tent metropolis and even a Ferris wheel.

This year also marked the 26th anniversary of the festival, which had its biggest turnout yet.

Overall, the weeklong festival leading up to Labor Day was successful and safe except for Thursday's death of a 29-year-old Wyoming woman who was struck by a bus carrying passengers on the playa of the Black Rock Desert.

Crime statistics will not be released until later this month. But the festival's eclectic artwork, offbeat theme camps, concerts and other entertainment drew praise from participants from around the world.

'Actually, I feel renewed faith in humanity,' John Bacon, of Seattle, told KRNV-TV.

Ron Adair, of Ojai, California, said: 'It's a little hard to have that many nights in a row and get by on four, five, six hours of sleep every night.'

After it moved from San Francisco, the inaugural Burning Man in Nevada drew only about 80 people in 1990.

This year's Burning Man was also met with controversy.

Some festival-goers complained the essence of the event - a society without currency based on communal effort and giving - had been ruined by the high number of billionaires and tech professionals bringing with them RVs, bodyguards, and other high price tag luxuries.
