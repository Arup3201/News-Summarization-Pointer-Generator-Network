Bobby Beale being unmasked as the killer of his half-sister Lucy in EastEnders was not the only surprising plot twist in the last seven days.

Over in west London, Matthew Benham, the owner of Championship Brentford, confirmed the equally remarkable news that the club and manager Mark Warburton would part company in the summer.

And if fans of the BBC soap were left disappointed that after 10 months of twists and turns an 11-year-old was revealed as the killer, then the Griffin Park faithful were left equally confused that the man who led them to promotion last season and is in the process of guiding them to their best season in 70 years is now set to depart.

It took less than a minute for the fans on the Ealing Road Terrace to start chanting Warburton’s name during Saturday’s excellent win.

But anyone thinking that was a dig aimed at the owner were proved wrong as those same fans started singing ‘There’s only one Matthew Benham’ straight after.

Benham, 43, invested in the club when they faced going out of business and by funding the new ground half a mile down the road has secured Brentford’s long-term future.

Many see Benham’s decision to part with Warburton and adopt a more continental style of management as a gamble. But that is exactly what Benham is. A gambler.

A physics graduate from Oxford University, he became a financial trader before moving on to become one of the world’s leading gamblers.

He set up Smartodds, a company which provides statistical and qualitative research to its clients in order for them to bet on football matches. The firm has developed a sophisticated probability model which takes into account theories, trends and anomalies to help get the best results.

Matthew Benham, the owner of Championship Brentford, has had a clash of philosophy with Warburton

Since taking over Brentford in 2012, Benham has shunned publicity and rarely gives interviews. But he did talk to Michael Calvin for his 2013 book on football scouting called The Nowhere Men.

‘If I am looking at a striker I absolutely do not care about his goalscoring record,’ Benham told Calvin. ‘For me, the only thing that is interesting is how the team do collectively, offensively and defensively, within the context of an individual’s performance.

‘I always thought Alan Shearer gave his team an amazing outlet. The team would be under pressure. You knew if you hoofed it in his general direction there’d be a high chance the ball would stick, and he’d win a foul. That’s the great defensive service Shearer is offering.

‘The fact a front player can hold the ball up means you are not going to concede another attack.

‘We’re working towards a new football model, we’re pretty far away. It is a computational issue.’

This approach does not fit well with Warburton’s philosophy. After Saturday’s win the manager said: ‘The emphasis is going slightly more to that mathematical model allied with the traditional scouting methods.

‘That is what the club have chosen and I have to respect that. But if I disagree with something now then I would rather be honest rather than leave in six months and look back with regret.’

For a club like Brentford the way to success is either to do what everyone else is doing and try and do it better. Or do things differently and try and get an edge.

The owner accepts that getting rid of Warburton and going down this new route is a risk. But what else would you expect? 

GRAPPLE OF THE WEEK

Shab Khan might swap the Conference North for the WWE after his weekend display. Worcester City’s left back was fouled by Stockport’s Charlie Russell — and threw him to the ground with a wrestling move.

Khan saw red, Russell a yellow. But at least the 10 men of Worcester won the game 2-0.

WHAT’S CAUGHT MY EYE... 

MK Dons’ 3-0 win over Peterborough brought an end to Darren Ferguson’s second spell at London Road. Back-to-back defeats have left Posh down in 15th in League One and he walked away with chairman Darragh MacAnthony describing him as ‘one of the finest managers in our club’s history’.

Striker David Connolly, 37, scored a 90th-minute winner for AFC Wimbledon as they beat Luton 3-2, 11 years and nine months after he scored his final goal for the original Wimbledon in 2003.
