His father is hailed as the greatest racehorse of all time, unbeaten in 14 spectacular outings.

Now meet the family: Son of Frankel, his thoroughbred mother. . . and a new brother or sister on the way.

They have nicknamed the little one Frank, for the moment at least – and upon his already impressive haunches may rest the chance of securing not just a fortune for his owners, but another place in history for the Frankel dynasty.

Grandstanding: The foal showed off his confident stride and juvenile physique for the cameras at Kensington Palace yesterday

Bidding for the three-month-old foal, sold with his pregnant mother, opened at £1million yesterday. At a landmark auction in the grounds of Kensington Palace, he became the first 'Frankelfoal' the champion has sired since retirement to be offered at a public sale.

The three-in-one package sold for £1,150,000 – or £1,462,800 including premium and tax.

That works out at more than £11 for every minute of Frank's 90-day life so far. He was bought by Michael Vincent Magnier, who runs one of the most prominent bloodstock operations in Europe.

Afterwards he said with some understatement he believed he had bought 'a nice horse'. He added: 'It's a little bit of history.'

Smiling, he looked forward to this time in 2016, when Frank will be ready to race. 'It will be quite an interesting week,' he said.

Mr Magnier also has a famous pedigree – he is the son of John Magnier, the business partner of former Manchester United manager Sir Alex Ferguson until they fell out spectacularly over another horse, Rock of Gibraltar.

Judging by little Frank's grandstanding performance yesterday, Mr Magnier landed a bargain.

With a confident stride, and the juvenile physique that quickly marked his father out as a winner, Frank may already have taken his first steps towards becoming a champion.

Was he showing off a teeny bit for the cameras? 'He knows he's special,' stud hand Frankie Price told me as she led him around the lawns of the palace orangery. 'He's got a real cool dude mentality. He's an absolute joy to be with.'

Frankel is rated the best horse ever on the Flat and was retired to stud in 2012, his bloodline is now highly sought-after

With Frank for his red-carpet style premiere was mother Crystal Gaze, due to give birth next year to another Frankel offspring.

Two of her previous foals have won races. Those who know are confident that Frank is another good 'un, as punters might phrase it.

The sale, by auction house Goffs and the Al Thani family of Qatar, was held on the eve of Royal Ascot, as the biggest names in racing gather in London.

Frank was meant to come last on a list of
 60 horses, a place he is unlikely to occupy often if he lives up to 
expectations.

But organisers brought his lot forward to stop him getting
 impatient.

They probably needn't have bothered. He simply stole the show.

David Redvers, owner of Tweenhills stud, which bred Frank and the awaited sibling, said: 'He's such a little superstar.

'He has never been off the farm in his life and here he is, showcasing a sale like this, taking the whole thing incredibly well.'

He confessed to 'a huge amount of regret' at selling Frank, adding: 'He has the same physical attributes as Frankel... just look at the hind quarters.

'That's where the engine is, and this is definitely a Formula One engine.'

But the best may be yet to come. Frankel took £3million in prize money in three years, retiring in 2012.

Well, a sort of retirement – he works six months a year as a stud.

So far, his prowess off the course has raked in five times in stud fees what he won on the track.

And if you were a betting man, you would probably take the odds that he's produced a clear winner to follow in his hoofsteps.
