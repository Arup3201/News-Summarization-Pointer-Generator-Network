Everton manager Roberto Martinez has claimed John Stones and Ross Barkley are 'as good as it gets' for their respective positions.

Martinez feels 20-year-old Stones is leading the way as a 'young centre-half' while 21-year-old Barkley is at the top as a 'No 10 in English football'.

Both are England internationals and Martinez has backed Stones as a future captain of Everton.

'He has got the essence, the material, the responsibility,' Martinez told the Daily Telegraph. 'He understands what it takes for a player to be a leader by action. 

'He's getting integrated into the Everton culture. It's been impressive how he's reacted every time he's had a game, how he became better the next time.

'Players with that sort of character need to be in the firing line. We can always replace a player with an experienced player but it's going to limit you. If we replace players with younger players who have incredible potential, we're going to have a period of learning, getting experience, but the benefits at the end will be untold. 

'In terms of a young centre-half with potential, John is as good as it gets. As a No10 in English football, Ross is as good as it gets. Ross knows exactly what he wants. When you love the game as he does, and get an education as he has at Everton, it's not a surprise that we keep producing these characters.'
