The hassle and embarrassment of wrestling with a wind-blown umbrella could now be a thing of the past, thanks to a hemlet-style head protector.

The Rainshader's canopy protects users from the wind and rain without obstructing their view and during tests in gale force seven - around 40mph - winds the umbrella didn't once blow inside out.

It was designed by Warwickshire-based company Hospitality Umbrellas and has been designed not to drip on other people or poke passers-by in the face.

Warwickshire-based entrepreneur Stephen Collier, pictured, redesigned the traditional umbrella with his Rainshader model. It is based on the design of a motorcycle helmet and its fibre-glass ribs and polyester canopy means it won't blow inside out, drip on other people or poke passers-by in the face

The Rainshader is based on the traditional motor helmet.

It folds up and is secured by a cleverly concealed internal 
Velcro strip and then fits into its handy shoulder carry case.

The Rainshader has:

Ten Spoke Fibre Glass Ribs

Black Aluminium Shaft

Rubber Motor Style Grip Handle

Polyester Canopy

Shoulder Carry Case

Height 90cm 

Width 5cm (when closed)

Canopy Width 65cm (when open)

Weight 0.5 kg

Entrepreneur Stephen Collier, 48, who owns Hospitality Umbrellas, came up with the idea during last year’s wet and windy Grand National.

He wanted to design an umbrella that could be used specifically for watching sporting events in a crowd.

The Rainshader has a cut-away front, which was based on the design of a motorbike helmet.

This means people can see out the front of the Rainshader while protecting their head and shoulders from the wind and rain.

It's design also means it doesn't obstruct the view of people standing nearby, or drip onto their shoulders. 

The Rainshader can also be used to protect users from the sun.

Collier said: 'It was pouring with rain, the wind was howling and I was 
struggling with my umbrella.

'I thought there had to be a better way.

'Traditional umbrellas have a lot of drawbacks in busy environments as 
they can blow inside out and make it difficult to navigate through 
crowds.

'The basic design of the umbrella hasn’t changed for centuries, so the 
time is ripe for to make it more suitable to modern settings.'

'I came up with a classic motorcycle helmet shape that is shaped like a dome so it doesn't stick out and there is no longer the fear of poking somebody in the eye.

'Anyone with a normal umbrella has to lift it over their head to see where they are going but the front of the Rainshader is opened up. 

Collier worked with Warwick University on his Rainshader umbrella. He then tested the design in a wind tunnel at Coventry University, pictured. The Rainshader was subjected to winds up to 40mph and didn't break, rip, or turn inside out

'Because it is slender, it is also more resistant to the wind than a normal umbrella.

'We tested ours out in a wind tunnel at 40mph and it still kept its shape whereas the regular one had popped inside out.'

Collier got help from designers and product developers at the Warwick Manufacturing Group (WMG) at Warwick University. 

He then tested the design using a wind tunnel at Coventry University.

The customisable Rainshader costs £24.99 and was specifically designed to be used in a crowd at sporting events or large outside gatherings. The caonpy completely covers the user's head and shoulders without dripping water on people stood nearby. It doesn't have the traditional 'spikes' of other umbrellas either, so doesn't poke other people in the face, or obstruct their view

Not only did Collier test the Rainshader to see if it blew inside out, it also used the wind tunnel at Coventry University to see how much the model protected his face from the wind and the wind chill

Collier tested a traditional umbrella in the tunnel, at wind speeds of gale force seven, and then tested the Rainshader.

While the traditional umbrella turned inside out almost immediately, the Rainshader was relatively unaffected - it didn't turn inside out and could be used to shield Collier's face from the wind. 

The Rainshader has ten spoke fibre-glass ribs covered by a customisable polyester canopy

It comes with a black aluminium shaft and rubber grip handle.

The canopy is 65cm wide when open and the whole umbrella weighs half a kilogram.

The Rainshader is 90cm tall and can be folded up and put into shoulder carry case.

It was funded by the European Regional Development Fund and the University of Warwick's International Institute for Product and Service Innovation.

The Rainshader costs £24.99 but the company insists it will last longer than traditional umbrellas.

During wind tunnel tests at Coventry University Collier also tested the traditional umbrella design. The umbrella turned inside out immediately when subjected to gale force winds. Collier came up with idea for the Rainshader after getting rained on at last year's Grand National
