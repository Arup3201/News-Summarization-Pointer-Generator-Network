A devastated English class have received a grovelling
apology from their headteacher after they were wrongly told they could take a
copy of a text into an exam.

Horrified teachers only realised their mistake when the exam
board contacted them to say it was in fact a closed book exam – and all results
would be cancelled.

The Year 11 students from Kenton School in
Newcastle sat through the entire AQA English Language AS Level exam earlier this month,
believing they could refer to their copy of Eden Close by American writer Anita
Shreve.

Headteacher David Pearmain, delivered the blow to
the students and their parents yesterday and said the school was 'mortified', putting it down to a 'really bad mistake'.

Blundering teachers allowed students to take a text into the exam which meant they were disqualified. Library picture

But exam board AQA insists the guidelines were clear and it had
no choice but to disqualify all the participants.

Mr Pearmain said: ‘It was a bad mistake and I have
personally apologised to the students affected by it and also to their parents.

‘The school, very unusually, made a mistake and it is a
terrible mistake on exam entries.

‘But one thing to understand - and I will keep apologising
to school pupils and parents - as it happens it will not disadvantage any of
those students in their future.

‘That is a bit of good news.’

Students were told they were allowed to refer to their copy of Eden Close by Anita Shreve during their English exam

The pupils had taken GCSE English at the end of Year 10 ahead
of their peers as they excelled in the subject.

The top-set pupils were given the chance to take their
AS-level English language and literature exam early.

They had sat Unit 1 of the exam separately, and will be able
to keep those results.

In a letter sent out to parents, Mr Pearmain, said: ‘I am
very sorry to report that a serious mistake was made by the English department
and the students were led to believe they were allowed to take their texts into
the exam.

‘This was not the case and as a result AQA took the decision
to disqualify all candidates who were entered for Unit 2.

‘This means the students will be awarded a grade for their
Unit 1 examination,  which is unaffected
by this, but their Unit 2 result will be cancelled.

‘This will not be recorded as a "fail" but will be classed
as a "non-entry" and will mean the students have completed 50 per cent of this
AS course.’

He also told parents that students who sat the exam and
return to the school in September will be given the opportunity to complete the
course in January with the help of extra lessons.

The school has now launched an investigation into how the
mistake happened.

Mr Pearmain said: ‘It was still a mistake that was made by
the school and we are mortified to have made that mistake and will make sure it
will never happen again.

‘It is a really bad mistake.’

Parents, who are being invited to meetings at the school to
discuss the issue, reacted with shock and anger when they found out.

A spokesman for AQA said: ‘The guidance we provide to
schools and colleges is very clear, so issues like this are quite rare.

‘However, if situations like this arise we need to be fair
to all students taking our exams.

‘We therefore, unfortunately, have no option but to take
this action, but we do so knowing that they have further opportunities to sit
this unit.’
