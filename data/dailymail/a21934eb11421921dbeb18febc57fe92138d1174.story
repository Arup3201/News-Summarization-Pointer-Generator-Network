A drug used as a cancer treatment has been found to slow the progression of a fatal lung disease significantly.

Scientists from Southampton General Hospital discovered that nintedanib makes a dramatic difference to idiopathic pulmonary fibrosis (IPF).

The condition, which affects mainly men and former smokers, causes inflammation and scarring of the lung tissue. Sufferers have an average life expectancy of between three and five years, with 5,000 deaths and 5,000 new cases every year.

The drug nintedanib was previously used to treat cancer and has been shown to slow the progress of idiopathic pulmonary fibrosis

Nintedanib works by blocking the chemical signals that activate the disease by creating excess tissue and scarring and causing breathing problems.

The two studies, led by Professor Luca Richeldi, a consultant in respiratory medicine at Southampton General Hospital, compared the breathing capacity of 638 people with IPF who used the drug with 423 who took a placebo.

Breathing capacity is measured by the amount of air a person can expel after their deepest breath, which is seriously affected in IPF sufferers.

Researchers found that the decline in the breathing capacity of patients taking nintedanib was cut by around half over the two studies. The drug is now likely to be licensed worldwide within the next year, and avail-able to patients in the near future.

Professor Richeldi said: ‘The impact of this study cannot be overstated. These are exciting results and mean nintedanib has the potential to offer patients a new direction in treating this aggressive disease.’

He said: 'The prognosis for patients with IPF is worse than many cancers and cases are increasing by 5,000 a year in the UK alone, so the need for new, targeted and more effective treatments has never been greater.

'Nintedanib specifically targets some key molecular pathways known to be involved in IPF, which gives us a much clearer insight into how the body works and how we might be able to further develop treatments.

He added: 'We expect an advance use programme to begin in Europe before next summer, so the drug may become available to at least some patients within the next few months.'
