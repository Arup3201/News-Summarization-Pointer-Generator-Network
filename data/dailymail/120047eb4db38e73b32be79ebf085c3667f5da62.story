They are the unique eye-catching 'Doodles' which have become the signature of the world's biggest search engine.

Now one lucky designer will get the chance to have their art seen by Google's millions of daily visitors, after the Internet giant began its search for a new Google Doodle creator.

Google is advertising for a new 'Doodler' to create its trademark designs which celebrate anything from famous historical figures to landmark dates on its home page.

Unique: One of Google's recent Doodles, which celebrated what would have been writer May Ziade's 126th birthday

Creative: A February 6 Google Doodle, which marked the 80th birthday of film critic Francois truffaut

Abstract: This imaginative Doodle in January this year marked what would have been the 374th birthday of Danish anatomist Nicolas Steno

The search engine says the successful applicant will have a 'sense of humor, love of all things historical and imaginative artistry'.

Google's advert for the Doodler position, which will be based at the Mountain View headquarters in Silicon Valley, California, reads: 'Every day, hundreds of millions of online users visit the Google homepage. Yes, to search. But also, to be delighted, informed, and surprised (And maybe even to laugh a little).

'The Google Doodle makes this possible - it's the change that is constant on Google.com.

'From Jules Verne to Pac-Man, you have the reins to our brand and iconic logo and can run free with your innovative ideas.'

Credentials: Applicants for the post at Google, which will be based at the Mountain View, California, headquarters, are said to need at least four years' experience

Memorable: Google's Les Paul interactive Doodle last year was one of their best efforts

Commemorative: Other Doodles remember significant dates, such as this one from January 23 which marked Chinese New Year 2012

Festive: Another design in January this year wished Google users a Happy Holiday season

Although no details of salary are given for the post, Google has said candidates should have a minimum four years experience and a 'wide range of artistic styles'.

The selection process for jobs at Google is said to be notoriously tough, with candidates having to pass several interview stages and testing before landing a role with the search engine.

In its information to applicants, Google states: 'Virtually every person who interviews at Google talks to at least four interviewers, drawn from both management and potential colleagues.'

Since first introducing the Doodle on its homepage, Google has commemorated dozens of famous people and historical dates and anniversaries.

When Google marked what would've been the 96th birthday of guitar pioneer Les Paul with a playable guitar on its homepage, the interactive Doodle was said to have cost Â£166m in lost productivity.

Last year alone Google produced 260 Doodles, including tributes to U.S. author Mark Twain, Muppets creator Jim Henson and pioneering physicist Marie Curie.
