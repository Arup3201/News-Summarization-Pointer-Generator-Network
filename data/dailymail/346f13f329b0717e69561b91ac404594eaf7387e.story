England beat San Marino in a convincing 5-0 win at Wembley on Thursday night to maintain their 100 per cent record in qualifying for the Euro 2016 finals to be held in France.

Phil Jagielka, Wayne Rooney, Danny Welbeck and Andros Townsend were all on the scoresheet for Roy Hodgson's Three Lions while the visitors Alex Della Valle completed the rout with an own goal. 

Sportmail's Sam Cunningham provides his players ratings for the England players.

Joe Hart - 6

Had barely anything to do, apart from view England pass the ball around their opponents for 90 minutes plus stoppage time.

Calum Chambers - 6

Solid at right back on his first England start, but rarely tested. A comfortable evening, but could perhaps have pushed on more.

Phil Jagielka (centre) put England ahead against San Marino on 24 minutes heading home a corner

Phil Jagielka - 7

Headed in the vital first goal which England needed as their opponents frustratingly threw everyone behind the ball.

Gary Cahill - 6

One of the quietest nights he will have this season and in the entire qualification process for Euro 2016.

Kieran Gibbs - 6

Like his counterpart on the opposite flank, there was no threat from San Marino on the wings and he went untroubled.

Jordan Henderson (right) played well in centre midfield for England, keeping things ticking over

Jordan Henderson - 6

Another in a more defensive position whose job was to go through the motions and keep concentrated, which he did.

Jack Wilshere - 5.5

Strangely misplaced a few passes – usually his strong point – but found space well. 

James Milner - 5

Poor from the midfielder to pick up a yellow card for a needless foul in the first half, knowing that two bookings will see him banned for a match.

Raheem Sterling (right) proved a constant menace to San Marino with his direct running and trickery

Raheem Sterling - 7

Looked sharp and was a constant danger, finding holes and making runs. Always looked the most likely to do some damage for England.

Danny Welbeck - 7

Got the goal to keep his hot streak going, with seven goals in his last eight games for club and country.

Wayne Rooney - 7 - MOTM

Won and scored the penalty to ease England to victory. Nothing spectacular, but then nothing spectacular was needed.

That goal moved Rooney to 41 international goals - just two behind Jimmy Greaves in England's all-time list

England subs: Oxlade-Chamberlain 7 (for Henderson 46min) Lallana 6.5 (for Sterling 46) Townsend 7 (for Welbeck 66)  

Not used: Forster, Lambert, Clyne, Shelvey, Delph, Baines, Foster.

Manager: Roy Hodgson - 7

A no-win situation for him but he made positive changes at half-time to up the tempo.

Referee: Marcin Borski - 7 

No controversial decisions and made the right call for the penalty and Milner’s yellow.

San Marino (5-4-1): Simoncini 5; Palazzi 5 (Buscarini 73, 5), F Vitaioli 5, Della Valle 5, Brolli 5, Battistini 5; Hirsch 5, Tosi 5 (L Gasperoni 63, 5), Chiaruzzi 5, M Vitaioli 5; Selva 4 (Rinaldi 87).
