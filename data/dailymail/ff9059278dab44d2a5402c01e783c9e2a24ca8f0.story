Asda is leading the way among the major supermarkets in tough economic times by offering Christmas dinner for as little as £2.47 per person.

A Christmas food prices survey saw the Walmart subsidiary chain ahead of Morrisons at £2.49, Aldi at £3.04 and Sainsbury's at £4.32. 

With families across Britain already suffering thanks to increasing gas bills and petrol costs, the cheap option may prove tempting.

Deals: Families will be able to enjoy a cheap Christmas dinner if they want, thanks to Asda, Morrisons and Co

Three 550g turkey breast joints with Lincolnshire style stuffing will cost customers just £3 each from Asda.

Along with mince pies, Christmas pudding, potatoes, stuffing, parsnips, carrots, and, of course, Brussels sprouts, the total cost is £14.84 for a meal which serves six.

Some customers are already starting to 
prepare by purchasing products in advance, spreading the cost of 
Christmas over the weeks beforehand.

By purchasing cheaper goods now, they 
will not be hit with a big bill during the festive period - as long as 
the products bought have long enough sell-by dates.

Richard Dodd, from the British Retail Consortium, told the Sunday Express: 'A third of all groceries in supermarkets are on offer, competition for Christmas customers is intense and Christmas shopping is starting now.'

But despite supermarkets slashing prices
in the hope of attracting customers with a value option Christmas 
dinner, the average amount spent on a meal for up to six people will be 
£93.

The price of Brussels sprouts, report
the Sunday Times, has risen 42% from last year, while in Sainsbury's a 
pack of six mince pies, which cost £1 last year, now is £1.65.

Poor supplies thanks to wet weather mean more food is being sourced from overseas, which can contribute to rising prices.

Some shoppers have turned away from their usual stores to do their shop - with many using budget chains like Lidl.

The amount of new customers more accustomed to luxury goods who shop there now had has forced the store to produce a range of deluxe products.

Nick Nairn, the youngest Scottish chef to win a Michelin star, has been employed to come-up with a Christmas menu based on the Lidl range.

They are set to take on the upmarket likes of Marks and Spencer, Waitrose and Sainsbury's - at a fraction of the cost.

Lidl said that it had greatly expanded its luxury range 'due to customer demand.'

The budget chain says Christmas would not be the same for the middle classes without 'affordable luxury'.

So Nairn - who has cooked for The Queen - has produced recipes that include reindeer, lobsters, goose, pheasant and partridges.

Christmas favourite: Brussels sprouts have risen 42% in price from last year - but will still fly off the shelves

'This year we have expended our deluxe range due to customer demand,' said a spokesman for Lidl. 'It is a reflection of our growing customer base.

'They seem to be going down well with customers - where else can you get a lobster for the price we sell at? It is luxury at affordable prices and Nick has worked with that for this year's festive guide.'

As mentioned earlier, people are already beginning to make their Christmas preparations with sales of puddings up 62 per cent from a similar time last year.

Mince pie sales are up 32 per cent and Christmas chocolate selection boxes are up 42 per cent.

These figures come from Waitrose but are likely to be replicated across other stores, which are also stocking Christmas foods and giving away festive carrier bags.

On sale: Christmas puddings are being snapped up weeks in advance - last year they were hot property

The increase in sales seems to have been driven by retailers starting their Christmas sales push earlier than ever.

Tesco began selling Christmas-themed confectionary as early as August 29, sparking something of a backlash.

Separately, advertising watchdogs have received complaints from parents unhappy that early marketing is encouraging children to pester them far in advance of December 25.

Waitrose began selling Christmas lines on September 24, which was not long after many families had returned from their summer holidays.
