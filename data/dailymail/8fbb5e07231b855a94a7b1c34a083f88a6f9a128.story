Not just any doodle: Acclaimed Scottish artist Jack Vettriano painted Suddeny Last Summer to liven up the door on his boiler cupboard

It has all the benefits and advantages you would expect in a flat with a £2 million price tag.

But this particular property comes with an added extra – an original artwork from one of the nation’s most successful living painters.

Scottish artist Jack Vettriano is selling his luxury one-bedroom Knightsbridge apartment and it comes complete with one of his pictures painted directly on to a cupboard door.

He painted the picture to disguise the dull functionality of the boiler cupboard.

The work, which is entitled Suddenly Last Summer, shows a woman in 1940s costume resting one gloved hand against a car as she gazes into the distance.

Wearing sunglasses and with a black scarf over her head, her dark ensemble and coy pose add the hint of allure found in much of the artist’s work.

Speaking in 2009, Vettriano, 61, said: ‘To cover up the boiler cupboard I painted directly over the door. It was inspired by a love affair I had with a married woman some time ago and I called it Suddenly Last Summer.’

Art expert Bernard Williams of auctioneers Christie’s last night agreed the painting would be a great selling point for the property.

Everything must go: Lovers of art and property could have a dream deal on their hands with a one-bedroom apartment in Knightsbridge and an original painting

He said: ‘Jack Vettriano has still got a huge following. It is a one-off so it’s a difficult thing to value. I would say at least £100,000 but it could very well reach up to £300,000.’

Vettriano,
who counts Hollywood superstar Jack Nicholson and football legend Sir 
Alex Ferguson among his fans, bought the flat in 1998 for £450,000. 

Known
as the ‘people’s painter’, he has attracted both acclaim and criticism 
since he took up art professionally, with descriptions ranging from 
‘biscuit tin’ art to ‘badly conceived soft porn’.
