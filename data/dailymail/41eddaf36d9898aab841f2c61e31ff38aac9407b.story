A lawyer for Gerard Depardieu today claimed that his prosecution for drink driving was illegal – because the actor was ‘not completely sober’ when he was told about it.

During bizarre proceedings in a Paris criminal court, defence barrister Eric de Caumont admitted the Hollywood actor had been drinking champagne before he fell off his moped in the city last November.

But by the time he was questioned by detectives and then charged he was still too drunk to understand what was going on.

Mr De Caumont’s claims were denied by Paris police who said in a statement that Depardieu was ‘conscious, lucid and able to respond’ when he was charged.

Depardieu meanwhile failed to turn up in court today because he was away filming a thriller with Elizabeth Hurley in a country notorious for its human rights abuses.

Despite all this, prosecutors called for Depardieu to be banned from driving for 10 months and to be fined the equivalent of £3,400.  

The 64-year-old French movie star’s case had been postponed three times because he kept staying away.

He was accused of driving his moped through Paris while more than three times over the drink-drive alcohol limit.

‘He’s very busy in Grozny,’ said Mr De 
Caumont, referring to the capital of Chechnya, where Depardieu and Miss 
Hurley are working.

Mr De Caumont said Depardieu 'asked me to represent him in court where he wants to be judged, as he always said.'

Mr De Caumont also said he wanted to get Depardieu’s case struck out because correct procedures where allegedly ignored when police measured the amount of alcohol in his bloodstream.

But judges went ahead with the case and, after hearing evidence, deferred judgement until June 21st.

Depardieu, the star of some 150 films including Green Card and Cyrano de Bergerac, and Miss Hurley are making a movie called Turquoise in Chechnya, a country with a notorious human rights record which is run by the controversial Ramzan Kadyrov.

Kadyrov, a close friend of Depardieu, has been implicated in numerous crimes including torture and extra-judicial killings, but denies any wrong doing.

Miss Hurley said she was initially told that the film would be shot in Moscow, and ‘had to take a very deep breath’ when she was informed that filming would also take place in Chechnya.

Miss Hurley has claimed she has not met Kadyrov, but the leader has in turn posted pictures on social media showing him accompanying the actress and Depardieu around Grozny. Depardieu’s Paris court case continues.
