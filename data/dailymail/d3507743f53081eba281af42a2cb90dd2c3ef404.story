A vegan PETA employee loves tofu so much she wanted to write 'I love Tofu' as 'ILVTOFU' on her license plate but was denied by the state of Tennessee because they thought the plate was 'too vulgar.'

Whitney Calk has dedicated a lot of her time to living the vegan lifestyle and even works for PETA as an assistant manager for youth marketing.

When she moved from Virginia to Murfreesboro, Tennessee and tried to change her license plate, officials feared her message 'ILVTOFU' might be misinterpreted as meaning 'I love to f%*k.'

Soyvay!: All Whitney Calk wanted was to share her love for tofu on her license plate but was denied by the state for being too vulgar

You love to what?!: This is what the 'offensive' plate might look like had it been on the back of Whitney's car

'All I’m trying to do is spread a pro-vegan message with my license plate,' said Whitney Calk to WKRN-TV.

'It just seemed logical to change my license plate to something I believed in,' she continued.

When Calk called to ask the state why she'd been denied they told her message could be read as vulgar and that she wasn't the first person to be denied that specific license plate.

People in Florida, Virginia, and Colorado have also been denied the license plate with the same wording.

In Denver, Colorado in 2009, Kelly Coffman-Lee, 38, wanted her license plate to read 'ILVTOFU' as well but she also denied her request.

Coffman-Lee told The Huffington Post that tofu is a big part of her vegan diet because she is unable to eat meat.

DMV officials say that state plates must stay away from all abbreviations that are deemed gang slang, drug terms, or considered obscene.

Whitney from Tennessee got some suggestions on how to change her plate from people on social media but despite original ideas such as 'TOFULVR,' she decided to back off the issue.'I knew what I wanted, but I didn’t want to compromise with what was written,' Calk finished.

Lots on her plate: Whitney Calk is not the first person to try for the 'ILVTOFU' license plate and says that people have been turned down in Tennessee, Florida and Colorado
