This shocking footage shows a man kicking a helpless cat while videoing himself committing the act - all with a smirk on his face.

Staff at the Liverpool hostel were horrified when they were checking CCTV and spotted a man on camera kicking the little black and white cat named Catters into a doorway.

Moments before, the man had asked to use the hostel's bathroom but instead of leaving and thanking staff he brutally kicked their pet.

The unknown man is then pictured walking up to the cat as if he is about to enter the bathroom

The man then looks around to make sure that no one is watching him

Staff at Hatters hostel now want to see the callous abuser brought to justice and are asking for anyone who recognises the man to come forward.

They have also reported the incident to the RSPCA and pictures of the man have been shared on social media.

Catters was a stray before he moved into the hostel six years ago. Staff now lovingly care for the little cat, feeding him every day and even giving him a hot water bottle when it is cold.

They also spent their own money building a wooden hut for the cat and there is a mural in the hostel devoted to it.

But manager Paul Mercer, 32, said that although Catters used to be friendly and affectionate, since the attack his personality has changed completely.

He said: 'He doesnâ€™t seem to be suffering physically but he is definitely wary of humans at the moment.

'He will normally wander up to people and stand and the door and wait for them to let him in.

'Now he will start running rather than come up to you - he is very wary.'

Mr Mercer described the attack as 'disgusting'. He said: 'It was the fact that he was videoing himself doing it which was disgraceful.

'We want to find the guy because you would not have thought this is the first time he has done it.

'We want to see him caught.'

He is then pictured taking out his phone, ready to film the attack on the camera of his iPhone

The man can be seen lifting up his leg to kick the cat

The man then starts to turn round with a smirk on his face as if he is about to go back down the corridor

Mr Mercer said he was 'shocked' when he learned about the attack. He said: 'I was disgusted that someone could do it and it looked like he enjoyed it.

'It's the size of the guy in comparison to the cat.

'If you see someone hitting a kid you just donâ€™t do it. 

'The cat is part of the family.'

But the man then goes back to the door and pictures the cat lying on the bathroom floor

The man then gives the cat a second kick after the first attack

The man then walks off again and appears to be re-watching the footage on his phone

The man came into the hostel last 
Saturday night at around midnight and asked to use the bathroom.

He then walked down to the ground 
floor toilets and came out of the bathroom before kicking the cat back 
through the bathroom doorway.

He then returns a second time and kicks the animal again. The man is smiling throughout and videoing the attack on his iPhone.

Mr Mercer described the man as in his mid to late 20s and with Hispanic features.
