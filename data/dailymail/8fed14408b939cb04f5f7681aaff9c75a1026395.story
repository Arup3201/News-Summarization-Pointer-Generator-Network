Sick of getting sick, an antique shop owner has decided to take action by putting up a cheeky sign at the door, asking customers not to share their germs.

Owner of Antiques and Flash Trash in Buderim Queensland, Veronica Reynolds erected the sign because she says she can't afford to get sick with the flu.

The 66-year-old former breast cancer sufferer, who also contracted pneumonia a couple of years ago says she's very susceptible to getting sick.

'My doctor told me to stay away from the store but it keeps me going. I don't want people to cough all over me and make me sick,' she said.

The woman placed the sign in the store and has copped criticism over it

The sign, which has sparked a media frenzy, saw one customer up in arms.

Ms Reynolds said a woman got quite aggressive with her husband John when she came into the store on Saturday, claiming it was offensive. She said her husband told the woman she was being a 'smart arse' after she would not accept his explanation about his wife's dire health. It's then the woman turned on him saying he looked like he had the flu.

Ms Reynolds told how the customer then proceeded to rip up the sign and throw it on the floor, which was all caught on camera.

Following on Monday, the Reynolds' received a phone call from, who they believed to be the Terry White pharmacist at the Sunshine Plaza.Â 

'They asked if we wanted a carton of masks for customers to use in the shop.'

But after contacting the store back the next morning, Ms Reynolds realised the phone call was a hoax. She believes it was the woman who came into her store on Saturday.The incident prompted a call to Maroochydore police, fearing the woman would continue to harrass her but said they simply weren't interested in her claim.

When Daily Mail contacted Maroochydore police they said they were unaware of the report but would look into it further

'We will be sending officers down to the shop to follow up and see if there is anything we can do.'

The move has also drawn plenty of positivity. 'I've had great reaction.' said Ms Reynolds. ' I haven't had one negative comment and I won't back down, I won't be removing that sign.'As for surrounding businesses, they were slightly oblivious to the attention the sign had received but weren't too sure it was the best of ideas.'We need all the business we can get and it's not something we would do.' said staff at Will and Harry's Takeaway.
