A couple have defied all the odds to become parents to two daughters.

Ellen and Jonathan Mather have two children thanks to IVF treatment, but having children nearly cost Mrs Mather her life.

Mrs Mather had two rounds of IVF in 2008 the first of which failed and the second resulted in an ectopic pregnancy.

Ellen and Jonathan Mather endured six rounds of IVF to have their two daughters - Katie (right) and Emily (left)

She had to have her fallopian tubes removed following the ectopic pregnancy.

In 2009 Mrs Mather, from Barrow in Cumbria, conceived again after more IVF but the pregnancy proved difficult.

Despite having had her fallopian tubes removed, Mrs Mather was convinced she was suffering a second ectopic pregnancy.

‘I asked “what’s the chance of it happening again?”’ said Mr Mather, 31, a support worker.

‘We were told there was more chance of winning the lottery three times in a week.’

Mrs Mather, 33, was pregnant with twins but unbeknown to medical staff, one of the embryos was growing in the scar tissue of one of the removed fallopian tubes.

Before Katie was conceived, Mrs Mather had a failed cycle of IVF and another that resulted in an ectopic pregnancy - this meant she had to have her fallopian tubes removed

‘Deep down I knew I was having an ectopic pregnancy,’ said Mrs Mather.

It is known that the chance of having an ectopic pregnancy is slightly higher after IVF treatment than after a natural conception.

She was admitted to A&E when she was nine weeks pregnant and started to suffer intense pain.

An ectopic pregnancy is when a fertilised egg implants itself outside the womb, usually in one of the fallopian tubes.

This means the egg will not develop into a baby.

Most women suffering an ectopic pregnancy start to show symptoms between week five and week 14 of the pregnancy.

These symptoms can include abnormal bleeding and abdominal pain.

If the ectopic pregnancy is detected at an early stage, the pregnancy can be terminated using medication.

If it is detected at a more advanced stage, surgery may be required to remove the egg.

Without treatment, there is a risk that the egg could continue to grow and cause the fallopian tube to rupture.

This can cause life-threatening internal bleeding.

Signs of a ruptured fallopian tube are a sudden pain, feeling faint, feeling or being sick and shoulder pain.

About one in 90 pregnancies in the UK are ectopic pregnancies.

Mrs Mather was bleeding internally and by the time she reached theatre she was dangerously ill, despite having received blood transfusions.

She said: ‘At that time I was given a one in 50,000 chance of being alive.’

She was in theatre for five hours, with Mr Mather facing the agonising prospect of losing his wife and unborn children.

‘When they opened her up they could see the membrane with Katie inside and they were going to take everything out,’ recalled Mr Mather.

‘[The consultant] said he wouldn’t have given a million to one chance of the baby surviving, let alone Ellen. He didn’t tell us about that until much further along when we found out we were having a girl.’

Instead of removing the womb in theatre, the consultant, Mr Vincent Bambigboye, managed to save both Mrs Mather and one of the twins, Katie – he had to remove the one who was growing outside the womb.

‘The consultant said he had never seen anything like it in his whole career,’ said Mr Mather.

Baby Katie, the surviving twin, was born prematurely at 35 weeks by Caesarean section.

She arrived on January 19, 2010, weighing 6lbs 1oz.

But Mrs Mather’s hopes for her family didn’t end there.

When Katie was two the couple started IVF treatment again in the hope of having a second child.

They had two failed attempts before Mrs Mather became pregnant with their second daughter, Emily.

Mrs Mather was carefully monitored throughout her pregnancy again under the care of Mr Bambigboye.

The
 pregnancy went well until 37 weeks when Mrs Mather developed 
pre-eclampsia and Emily was born by emergency Caesarean on March 8, 
2013.

Katie was one of twins but her twin developed outside the womb and caused Mrs Mather to suffer internal bleeding. As a result, the twin had to be removed to save Mrs Mather and Katie

‘It’s all been worth it,’ said Mrs Mather. ‘It was tough at the time. Jonathan took some persuading after the second time round but he did say that if it wasn’t for me we wouldn’t have Emily. I’ve got a few nice scars but a couple of trophies to go with it.’

The couple are indebted to Mr Bambigboye and the staff at Furness General Hospital.

Mr Bambigboye said: ‘I only played a small role so it is the hard work and dedication of all the nurses, doctors, midwives, and others that led to such a positive outcome for Ellen and her family.

‘On behalf of myself and my colleagues, I’d like to thank Ellen for her kind words, and wish her, Katie, and the rest of the family, all the very best for the future.’

Ellen Mather's first cycle of IVF failed and the second one resulted in an ectopic pregnancy - Mrs Mather had to have her fallopian tubes removed

This baby had to be removed and doctors feared Mrs Mather would die
