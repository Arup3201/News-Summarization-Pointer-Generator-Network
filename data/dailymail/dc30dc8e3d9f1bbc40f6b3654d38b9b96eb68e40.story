This building has stood against the elements for more than 170 years - but now nature is reclaiming its place.

Weeds, stems and shoots creep up the Victorian exterior, and have even made their way inside on the highest levels of the crumbling, derelict property.

St Edmund's Hospital is the name by which the building was most recently known, but it was actually constructed as a workhouse for the poor in 1936.

Growth: Plantlife is creeping through the windows of this first-floor corridor

Desolate: The former hospital site is now full of debris, and plant-life from outside is beginning to creep into the building

High climber: These plants have established themselves even on the upper floors of St Edmund's Hospital

Danger: Fences surround the building, discouraging others from entering

It has stood abandoned for 15 years since the hospital closed after 70 years of service. And, thanks to its place in history as one of the buildings spawned by the 19th-century Poor laws, it has proved difficult to get rid of.

Though a tide of outrage at the suffering of those who laboured inside - fanned by tales like those in Charles Dickens's novel Oliver Twist - closed the workhouses for good, they have a lasting place in history.

The significance of the building - designed by architect Sir George Gilbert Scott, who was behind London's St Pancras Station and the University of Glasgow - was reaffirmed last year when the Government slapped down an application to remove its listed status.

Outside: Vegetation is encroaching on the derelict building, in Northampton

Decay: A combination of vegetation (left) and the work of graffiti artists (right) have helped speed the decline of the building, constructed in the 1830s

Crumbling: Parts of the building's walls have collapsed, leaving some rooms completely exposed to the elements

But inside the former medical centre 
is a haunting and dangerous sight. Frequented by the homeless for 
shelter, its windows are mostly smashed and sharp debris covers the 
floors.

Little medical 
equipment remains, except for dust-covered signs and the occasional 
abandoned bedpan. Elsewhere the crumbling walls, potentially unstable 
floors and exposed lift shafts make it an uncomfortable site to visit.

St Edmund's was converted into a hospital in the 1930s, and continued for almost 70 years until it was closed down and its functions moved elsewhere.

The land was bought up by developers and other buildings, which are part of the original hospital site, have been demolished and replaced by a Tesco Express store and a restaurant.

Former developers Rochmills had planned to turn the site into retirement homes and office space, but their plans, submitted in 2010, were withdrawn shortly after.

Ward: Signs remain identifying the different areas of the hospital, as well as the occasional medical item such as the pictured bedpan

Untouched: The dusty sign to the right identifies the Wordsworth Ward area of the former hospital

Dangerous: This staircase, left, leads to potentially unstable upper floors, while lift shafts such as this (right) are now exposed through the hospital

Disused: Wallpaper peels from the wall around this abandoned piece of equipment

Worse for wear: The hospital complex has been abandoned since 1998

Planning permissions for the site has now lapsed, which means that the local authority would have to approve any further work before it can take place.

Last year there were attempts by an anonymous applicant to remove the building's listed status - claiming that it never should have been granted in the first place - which would have made it easier to develop the site.

But the Government, supported by advisory body English Heritage, rejected the bid because of the building's importance as a former workhouse.

At the time an English Heritage spokesman told the local paper: 'We’re pleased the Government has agreed with our recommendation to keep St Edmund’s Hospital in Northampton on the statutory List.

'Built in 1836-7, it was one of the first generation of New Poor Law workhouses, designed by the eminent Victorian architect George Gilbert Scott, and it represents a key moment in changing social attitudes towards the provision made for the poor and destitute.'

Bare: The hospital site has long been stripped of any medical supplies

Message: The walls still feature instructions to patients and visitors

Bedding down: The eerie development, formerly a workhouse for the poor, is now used occasionally by homeless people for shelter
