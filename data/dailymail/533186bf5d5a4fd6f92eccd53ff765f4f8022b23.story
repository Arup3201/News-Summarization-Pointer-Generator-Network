A pensioner says he is a prisoner in his own home after a busy bus stop was placed at the end of his drive.

Retired caretaker Ivor Souter, 66, came home one day to find the yellow bus stop markings outside his bungalow.

Mr Souter, of Sheffield, South Yorkshire, says local services now regularly pull up in front of his driveway - every three minutes.

Retired caretaker Ivor Souter came home from a hospital visit to find the entrance to his home had been turned into a bus stop

The markings take in the entire entrance to Mr Souter's bungalow, making him a prisoner in his own home

It also means the passenger pick-up point now sits squarely at front of Mr Souter's home.

He said he was stunned to discover his local council had extended an existing bus stop to outside his drive.

Mr Souter said: 'I go to the hospital, I come back, and they've done it. It's absolutely barmy.

'I've no idea why they've done it. There was no consultation. I can't get in and out of my drive.

'They've extended the bus stop right past my dropped kerb. It's making me a prisoner in my own home.

'This road is a major artery to Crystal Peaks shopping centre, so I must have buses coming and going every 10 minutes.

Two at once: The retired caretaker came home from a hospital visit to find the entrance to his home had been turned into a bus stop

Right outside: Mr Souter said: 'I go to the hospital, I come back, and they've done it. It's absolutely barmy'

'Then there's the other routes which also stop here. There are at least 20-odd buses going past every hour.'

A spokesman for Sheffield Council said: 'This is part of an Â£18 million Better Bus programme over the next five years.

'At the end of the day this is a public highway and major route into the city. More than 20 per cent of passengers use this service.

'This is part of a package of measures to make buses better and safer in the city, and includes making buses wheelchair and pram friendly.

'This may mean moving some bus stops, but there has been a huge amount of consultation with residents and bus users in this area.

'We aim to strike a balance between making sure people can access safer, better buses with keeping all residents happy.'

A spokesman for Sheffield's Passenger Transport Executive, the body responsible for maintaining bus stops in the city, said: 'There have been improvements to the bus stop but that has only been a tactile pavement for visually impaired passengers.

'We are not going to remove the tactile paving.'
