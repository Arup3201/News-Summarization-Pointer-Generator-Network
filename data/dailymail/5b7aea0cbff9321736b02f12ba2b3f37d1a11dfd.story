Dutchman Florentijn Hofman could well be the world's unluckiest artist.

The 37-year-old has already had to endure having his installation of a giant rubber duck stabbed 42 times, attacked by an eagle and washed away in a storm.

Now another of his works, an enormous white rabbit fabricated out of waterproof paper to guard it from the rain, has been destroyed in a blaze.

Bunny blaze: Dutch artist Florentijn Hofman's 82ft tall sculpture of a Moon Rabbit on display at the art festival in Taiwan before it was destroyed by fire

Hofman had been commissioned to create the 82ft tall 'Moon Rabbit' for the Taoyuan Land Arts Festival in Taoyuan County northern Taiwan, where it had proved a big hit with visitors.

But at the end of the 11 day festival, as workers were disassembling the huge sculpture, a fire, believed to have started by sparks from a chainsaw, tore through the rabbit's torso and paws.

A spokesman for Taoyuan County's Department of Cultural Affairs said: 'The workers have disassembled and set aside the rabbit's ears and head before removing the limbs of the rabbit'.

Aftermath: The Moon Rabbit was gutted by the blaze which is believed to have been started by sparks from a chainsaw

Flammable: The rabbit had been made from Tyvek a waterproof, paper-like material used in the construction industry. It had been positioned lying on its back on a grass bunker staring up at the moon

In a statement Hofman said he was 
relieved that no one had been injured and joked that the blaze was the 
result of the warmness that the Taiwanese people had shown towards his 
work.

Festival
 organisers had reportedly been attempting to disassemble the rabbit as 
quickly as possible before a typhoon was due to strike the region.

The
 idea of a Moon Rabbit comes from ancient Chinese mythology which states
 a giant rabbit lives on the moon as a companion of the moon goddess 
Chang'er.

However Moon rabbit myths also exist 
across East Asia and in Aztec mythology based on markings on the surface
 of the moon which are said to resemble a rabbit.

Hsin-yi
 Hu, exbihition manager for Blue Dragon Art Company, the Taiwan-based 
group responsible for bringing the rabbit to the festival tpold CNN: 
'The fortunate thing is that Moon Rabbit was especially designed for the
 short-term exhibition for Taoyuan Land Arts Festival, and the festival 
was over yesterday.'

Around 2.5 million visitors had attended the 11 day festival.

Another
 of Hofman's artworks, a 21-metre-long wooden sculpture of a 
hippopotamus is currently on display semi-immersed in the River Thames 
in London.
