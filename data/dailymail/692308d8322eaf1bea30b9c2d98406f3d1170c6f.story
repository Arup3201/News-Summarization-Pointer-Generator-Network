France’s match-winner Paul Pogba hailed his winning goal as one of the best moments of his life as Les Bleus swept into the World Cup quarter-finals by beating Nigeria 2-0 in Brasilia.

Pogba’s header came in the 79th minute and Joseph Yobo’s stoppage time sealed the win for Didier Deschamps' side after a hard-fought game against the Super Eagles.

And the Juventus midfielder said that his goal was 'liberating' as it lifted the pressure on France as favourites to advance to the last eight.

'I have no words to describe this feeling,' he said. 'The whole country is behind us and scoring that goal really liberated us. I am so happy for the team and all of France.

'To score a goal for your country, especially in such an important game as this, to get into the last eight of the World Cup is one of the best moments of my life.'

Deschamps said he was 'very proud' of his side but admitted that France had suffered from the tension.

He said: 'We’re in the quarter finals now and we will do everything we can to go one step further.'

Nigeria coach Stephen Keshi said he did not know what would happen about his future, and criticised USA referee Mark Geiger.

Keshi said: 'I thought the referee made a lot of mistakes and was very lenient to the French players. There was a very bad tackle on Ogenyi Onazi and he is probably out for weeks.'
