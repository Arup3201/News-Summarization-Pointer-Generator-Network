Every parent thinks of their own offspring as a little angel. But for Matt and Stephanie Brown the comparison is closer than most.

Their two-year-old son Oliver was born with a rare skin condition that makes him look like he has feathered wings across his upper back.

The unusual mark runs half way down his spine from his hairline and across his shoulder blades. But it must be checked by doctors at least every three months, his wings may turn lethal.

Little angel: Two-year-old Oliver Brown, from Fenstanton in Cambridgeshire, who was born with a large birthmark on his back on the top of his back that looks like a pair of angel's wings

Mixed blessing: The unusual mark runs half way down Oliver's spine from his hairline and across his shoulder blades. But it must be checked by doctors at least every three months, his wings may turn lethal

Baby love: Oliver with his mother, Stephanie. His parents have been told he will live a full and healthy life unless the condition spreads to his brain or spine. He also faces an increased risk of aggressive skin cancer

Oliver was at birth diagnosed with Congenital Melanocytic Naevi (CMN) - oversized moles or birthmarks which affect just one person in every hundred.

Despite the diagnosis Oliver is likely to live a full and healthy life, but he must be careful: children with particularly large marks are at increased risk of the most aggressive forms of skin cancer.

Because of that, he has to wear a sunsuit and prescription sunscreen to protect him from the sun's UV rays.

There is also a risk of the condition spreading to the brain or spine, where the lesions and moles could cripple his nervous system.

Mrs Brown, 34, from Fenstanton, Cambridgeshire, told Mason's News Service: '[Oliver] is one of the fortunate ones. Some children are riddled with moles and even get them on their eyelids.

'He actually has his on the top half of his back so it looks like wings. There can be lots of questions because it comes up to the nape of his neck and so is visible.

'As he gets older we would hope he can accept himself for who he is. We have all got these bits of ourselves that we do not like and we have to accept them.

'He is wonderful the way he is and I'm sure in the dark times he will realise this.

'He is lucky in the sense he is such a cutie pop, everyone seems to think so, and I think people will overlook his condition.'

Marks: The latest research has found the cause of 80 per cent of CMN cases is a mutated gene which develops as the baby is in the womb, said Lucy Hardwidge of the Caring Matters Now help group

Precious: Babies and children with CMN have regular MRI scans to check the spread of the condition

Oliver attends Addenbrooke's Hospital in Cambridge every three months for a check-up.

Doctors examine the moles to see if any are turning cancerous and Oliver is given MRI scans to see if he has developed any tumours on his brain or spine.

Lucy Hardwidge of the Caring Matters Now help group, said: 'Children with CMN have to be very careful.

'There is an increased risk of cancer so factor 50 sun cream is a must and we now have UV protection clothing which can be used.

'But it's also important to let them have their childhood and the kids still need vitamin D.

'Sometimes the birthmarks can break down and crack so they have to have cream to help them.

'In some cases it turns into CMN syndrome which sees pigmentation on the brain and spine which can cause fits and stop development and can be fatal when tumours develop.

'In children with CMN the cancer is 10 times more aggressive and it's untreatable once it reaches the brain.

'Our latest research has found the cause of 80 per cent of CMN cases and it's caused by a mutated gene which develops as the baby is in the womb.

'This is why it's so important to give babies MRI scans at birth and regularly to keep an eye on it in case it spreads.'

Charity work: Oliver with his seven-year-old brother Josh and other pupils at Fen Drayton Primary School, which is helping to raise money for Caring Matters Now by staging a 10km fun run

Ms Hardwidge said likening children's birthmarks to shapes lets them know they are special.

'When children have interesting shaped birthmarks it's a great way of telling them them about the condition and letting them know they are special,' she said.

'Oliver's mum does it by telling him he has angel wings.

'My own daughter has one on her leg shaped like a paw print and that was a great way of telling her about it.'

Oliver's seven year-old brother Josh's school, Fen Drayton Primary, is holding a 10k fun run to raise money for Caring Matters.

Oliver was diagnosed with Congenital Melanocytic Naevi (CMN) - moles or birthmarks which are present at birth and usually oversized. CMN stands for:

Though CMN means birthmark or mole at birth, around 1 per cent of CMN appear after birth, usually in the first year of life. 

The condition affects 1 per cent of people and having it means there is a risk that lesions and moles can also grow on the brain. This is called CMN syndrome, which can cause fits and stop development. If tumours develop, it can be fatal.

Children with particularly large marks are at increased risk of being diagnosed with malignant melanoma, the most lethal form of skin cancer. As a result, they must wear factor 50 sun cream and wear clothing with UV protection, if possible.

'In children with CMN the cancer is 10 times more aggressive and it's untreatable once it reaches the brain,’ said Lucy Hardwidge of the Caring Matters Now help group. 

Research has shown the majority of CMN cases are caused by a mutated gene. 'Therefore why it's so important to give babies MRI scans at birth and regularly to keep an eye on it in case it spreads,’ said Ms Hardwidge.
