Callum Salmond was reportedly found by other tourists unconscious in a pool in Turkey

A three-year-old British boy has died while on a family holiday after he was found unconscious and floating in a hotel swimming pool.

Callum Salmond was rushed to hospital from the five-star Voyage Belek resort in Turkey but was pronounced dead on Tuesday morning after several days in intensive care.

The nursery pupil from Kirkcaldy, Fife, was on holiday with his mother, Donna Ness, 31, father, Graeme Salmond, 32 and 9-month-old brother Max.

According to reports in the Turkish media, Callum was rescued after a British doctor who spotted him floating unconscious in one of the luxury resort's five swimming pools.

The British woman doctor, who was at the poolside when Callum was in the water, rushed to try to save him.

In a statement to Turkish police, the woman said she thought at first he was just playing in the water. But after looking more closely she realised the toddler was struggling in the pool. 

She performed CPR on him before paramedic arrived, and he was taken to hospital.

Turkish National Police said Callum's mother, Donna Ness, had been attending to her nine-month-old son Max, who had 'a rash', when the tragedy occurred.

Private Kemal Dincer of Belek police station, who took statements from Donna, 31, a marketing manager, and dad Graeme Salmond, 32, a garage service manager, said he was 'very sorry for what has happened'.

He said: 'The family were staying in 
the Voyage Belek, five star hotel and their kid, Callum, he fell in the 
water in the big pool.

'A British woman saw him. She was a 
doctor. She took him out the pool. She thought he was playing or 
swimming but when she carefully looked then she realised he was drowning
in the water.

'She got him out the pool and did first aid, CPR.

'Donna was near the pool when it happened but she had been dealing with the little boy, Max, because he had a rash.'

He added: 'Police have taken statements from the mama and papa and some other people who saw what happened.

'I am very sorry for what has happened.'

The youngster was resuscitated by 
paramedics who rushed him to a private hospital in the nearby town of 
Belek on Turkey's south coast.

He
was later transferred to the regional Anadolu Hospital, where he clung 
onto life for five days on life support following the tragic accident 
last Thursday.

An 
investigation has now been launched into Callum's death and the exact 
circumstances of how Callum had his accident remain unclear.

The family had booked their break with Thomas Cook, who confirmed 
yesterday that Callum had died following what they termed a 'near 
drowning'.

A spokeswoman said: 'I can confirm 
that Callum was not found dead at the hotel and that he died after 
spending several days in intensive care in hospital. He was taken to 
hospital after near drowning.'

Ulrich Sperl from Thomas Cook UK &
Ireland added: 'We would like to offer our sincere condolences to the 
friends and family of the deceased at what must be a truly difficult 
time.

'The welfare of our 
customers is our top priority, and a health and safety team is 
conducting a thorough investigation into the incident in collaboration 
with the relevant authorities.

'Our
team in resort continue to offer every support and assistance to the 
deceased's loved ones. In the interests of customer confidentiality, we 
are not at liberty to provide any further details at this time.'

Holiday destination: The Voyage Belek resort in Turkey where little Callum was discovered in a pool

The
all-inclusive Voyage Belek has five swimming pools, which include a 
shallow children's pool and a larger water park area with flumes and 
slides.

The resort boasts that it offers 'various activities' to children which are 'under the supervision of expert personnel.'

Staying at the resort, for a family of four, costs in the region of £3300 for a fortnight.

Parents at Strathallan Primary school in Kirkcaldy, where Callum attended nursery were issued with a letter on Tuesday morning notifying them of his death.

In it, headteacher Isabelle McBain said Callum had died after a 'tragic accident'.

The letter said: 'Our thoughts are with the family at this time.'

One parent said: 'This is every parent's worst nightmare.

'I've no idea what happened but my thoughts are with the wee boy's family just now.'

Karen Millar, chairwoman of Strathallan Primary's parent council, said: 'I know the whole school will be devastated at this news.

'Our thoughts are with Callum's family at this terribly sad time.'

Michelle Selby, who runs St Brycedale playgroup in Kirkcaldy where Callum used to attend, spoke of parents shock at the death.

She said: 'It's beyond a tragedy - it's every parent's worst nightmare.

'The children at the school were given a letter at the school to explain what's happened.

'He was only three, the children don't understand.

'He was a happy little soul - he moved on from playgroup and he seemed to have made friends.'

A member of staff at the Ford garage in Cupar, where Graeme works as service manager, confirmed the tragedy yesterday but said he could not comment any further.

A Foreign Office spokesman said last night: 'We are aware of the death of a British national in Antalya, Turkey on May 28. We are providing consular assistance to the family at this difficult time.'
