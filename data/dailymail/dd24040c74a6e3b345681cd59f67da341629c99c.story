An engineer who helped to design the award-winning Olympic velodrome will lead an event in memory of budding architect Stephen Lawrence.

The 18-year-old had dreamed of becoming an architect before he was stabbed to death in an unprovoked racist attack in 1993.

Now, in a fitting tribute to the teenager, Professor Chris Wise will talk about creating the world’s fastest velodrome, at the Olympic Park, at the Annual Stephen Lawrence Memorial Lecture next Tuesday at the Royal Institute of British Architects in London.

The event is in aid of the Stephen 
Lawrence Charitable Trust, which helps disadvantaged students to pursue a
career in architecture.

Professor Wise said: ‘The Stephen Lawrence Charitable Trust’s work will eventually become the most tangible product of Stephen’s legacy.

‘It’s a legacy that will last a very long time, and will profoundly affect the lives of many people, many of whom have not even been born yet.’
