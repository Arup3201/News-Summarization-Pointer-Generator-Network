A paraplegic woman has told how she managed to lose more than half her body weight and drop 11 dress sizes after ditching her electric wheelchair for a manual.

Mia Vayner, 54, who identifies as transgender and is currently based in Queens, New York, said after being left immobile in her forties her 6ft 3in frame came to tip the scales at around 540lbs.

But when doctors told her she only had one year to live because of the impact her large size was having on her health, she desperately sought ways to get active.

'I decided to get rid of my electric wheelchair because all I did was move my thumb,' she told MailOnline.

Without the $1,000-plus needed to buy a sports wheelchair, the DIY-minded Mrs Vayner used her knowledge of putting together kit cars as a teenager to craft her own version.

She purchased several broken chairs from Craigslist and built a 'Frankenchair' as she calls it for a mere $300.

The sportier design - complete with leopard print trim and off-road wheels - allowed her 
to move around more efficiently using core strength.

Grit and determination: Along with pushing her wheelchair Mia took up rock climbing and swimming - both activities building on her upper body strength

With the support of her wife, Evelyn, she started pushing herself around the block of their neighborhood.

Gradually she regained muscle memory from her days as a proficient practitioner in judo, lacrosse and rugby.

'I find that people actually what to have a
 conversation with me now and with my new wardrobe Iâ€™ve brought 12 new outfits'

In the first month, she lost 50lbs and by the time she had lost 100lbs, she was clocking up a mile every morning and then two.

The lifelong vegetarian complimented her new exercise regime with a cleaner diet, ridding the home of any tempting treats and cut back on her sportswoman-like portion sizes.

Today, four years on, she weighs a healthier 265lbs and she's lost 36inches off her waist taking her from a size 38 to a 16.

Source of support: Mia says her transformation would not have been possible without the help of her wife, Evelyn (right)

On the health front, her cholesterol and blood pressure levels are now normal, and
 she no longer has type 2 diabetes.

Her dream is to get surgery to remove the 20lbs-plus of excess skin hanging off her body -but at $8,000 it will require a little bit of saving first.

She describes the transformation as life-changing.

'The weight-loss has changed her 
outlook on life and given her another way
 to connect with her community'

'I find that people actually what to have a
 conversation with me now and with my new wardrobe Iâ€™ve brought 12 new outfits.'

Mia first sustained spinal injuries when she was physically assaulted as a child back in her native Australia. She spent a year in a specialist hospital unit and doctors eventually gave her the all-clear.

However, in her forties she experienced a bad fall during an epileptic seizure which caused the complications to return. This time around medics confirmed he damage was more serious.

Mia - with minimal feeling in her legs - lost the ability to stand, walk and was left wheelchair-bound.

New sense of self: Mia's wife says the weight-loss has 'changed her outlook on life and her self-respect'

In the past she had enjoyed being active, running restaurants and doing stand-up comedy but unable to work and spending the majority of time at home she became increasingly depressed.

'I was lying in bed and on steroid-based medicine. I went from being 240lbs of solid muscle to 400lbs. And then it's not much of a jump to 500lbs,' she recalled.

But now with her life back on track she is working on a sequel to her 2011 novel the Secrets The Mirror Kept and is even considering participating in a triathlon.

Evelyn Vayner told CNN that she is proud of her wife's unwavering sense of determination.

'Mia
 is a go-getter. She has lived a life with setback after setback yet 
she manages to look at the future and go after what she wants with more 
vigor and fight than anyone else I have ever known.

'The weight-loss has changed her 
outlook on life and her self-respect, and also has given her another way
 to connect with her community.'
