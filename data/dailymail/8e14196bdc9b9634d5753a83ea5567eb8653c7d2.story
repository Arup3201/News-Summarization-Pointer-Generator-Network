For Peterborough, the first half of this season turned out much like last.

A strong start, some raw talent unearthed by shrewd dealing in the transfer market; followed by a slump that has seen them fall away from automatic promotion contenders to play-off outsiders.

In fact, Darren Ferguson’s side are far closer to the League One drop zone in terms of points than they are the top two – 16 off second-placed Swindon yet only eight clear of Crewe in 21st.

The damning statistics go on. Following Sunday’s 0-0 draw at home to Doncaster, Peterborough have won just once in their last 10 league games. That is relegation form.

Now, while you’d be a brave man to tip Posh to go down, chairman Darragh MacAnthony knows the club must arrest this slide quickly. They cannot afford to stagnate.

On Monday, he announced on Twitter that he would be conducting a full review in to 2014 as we head in to the new year.

In all competitions, Posh played 57 games this year, winning 22 and losing 25. That is not good enough for a club wanting Championship football.

But they have no divine right. Sheffield United and Preston are both in their fourth consecutive seasons in the third tier. As they will both testify, the longer you stay down, the harder it is to get back up.

There was a sprinkling of quality added to Ferguson’s side over the summer, not least with the addition of winger Marcus Maddison from Gateshead, but it has not been enough to account for the loss of Britt Assombalonga.

Posh made a £4million profit in just over a year on the 22-year-old striker. Selling him to Nottingham Forest for £5.5m in August represented a fantastic piece of business for a League One club.

When mulling over that offer, MacAnthony will have cast his mind back to the summer before when Peterborough sold top scorer Dwight Gayle to Crystal Palace and managed to replace him with Assombalonga, spending less than a quarter of the fee received for Gayle.

But, despite all showing flashes of promise, young strikers Conor Washington, Luke James and Kyle Vassell have not hit anywhere the heights of Assombalonga, or of Gayle before him. 

And Assombalonga’s 23 goals could only take Posh to a play-off semi-final in May.

Ferguson will no doubt want more money to spend in January and will perhaps expect it given the three promotions he has earned at the club in two spells and the money earned from selling Assombalonga.

But the fact of the matter is that at least six of the nine sides above Peterborough in the League One table heading in to 2015 went in to the season with lower expectations and are working on tighter budgets.

Ferguson needs to get the best out of what he’s got already and with nearly two weeks until their next match while that review of 2014 takes places, the training field is where he has to find the answers.

He has tinkered plenty with formations and players over the course of the year with frustrating consequences for the Posh faithful.

Ferguson needs to settle on a team and show his managerial credentials, because Peterborough can’t afford another year like this one.

Good Christmas for… NEWPORT

A maximum six points from two games has seen the Welsh side leap up in to the League Two play-offs. Sunday’s 1-0 win at Cheltenham was followed a 2-0 home defeat of Plymouth - results which see Justin Edinburgh’s side enter 2015 in fifth place and just three points off the automatic promotion places.

Bad Christmas for… MILLWALL

While the likes of Bolton, Fulham and Reading have been upwardly mobile in the bottom half of the Championship in recent weeks, Ian Holloway’s side have been sinking like stone. 

A 6-1 drubbing at Norwich on Boxing Day was followed by a 2-0 home defeat by league leaders Bournemouth on Sunday. 

With the resources available to Wigan and Brighton beneath them, the Lions are now second-favourites for the drop behind stranded Blackpool.

Talent scout: Tom Bradshaw (Walsall)

After making his debut for Shrewsbury aged 17, Welsh striker Bradshaw has long been tipped for big things and now, aged 22, he is really beginning to fulfil his promise. 

Three goals in two games over the festive season have seen Bradshaw takes his tally for the season to 12 in just 15 League One appearances. 

A summer move to Walsall has kickstarted his career but Bradshaw may not be at the club much longer if he keeps scoring at this rate.
