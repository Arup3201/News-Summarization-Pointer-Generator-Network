With just the clothes on their back and the rucksacks on their shoulders, an Italian port is swamped by hundreds of immigrants as yet another boat unloads its cargo of desperate travellers fleeing the horrors of their homeland.

The crowds of men, women and children have disembarked at Port Augusta in Sicily after making the terrifying journey across the Mediterranean - a trip which has claimed the lives of more than 1,000 people over the last 12 months - in the hope that they will be able to find asylum and a better life in Europe.

Many arrive from Libya, where human traffickers have begun to take advantage of the breakdown in order following the toppling of Colonel Gaddafi in 2011, while others come from other north African countries such as Eritrea.

Hoping for a new start away from the horrors of their homelands, these refugees arrive at Port Augusta in northern Sicily with, some with just the clothes on their backs 

The long line of migrants are led to a refugee camp by guards to make their claim for asylum - and their bid to start a new life 

The migrants have travelled across the Mediterranean, fleeing war-torn countries including Libya, which has seen a breakdown in social order since the collapse of Colonel Gaddafi's regime in 2011

As their application is processed, they are housed in blue tents with their families after being given clean clothes and fed with milk and biscuits 

Upon their arrival their first step is to hand over documents from the country they have fled before their photo is taken.

They are then fed with milk, water and biscuits, washed and given clean clothing before being taken to one of the many refugee camps around Europe, some seeking ultimate refuge in the UK. 

Some 140,000 illegal migrants have entered Europe via Italy since January – more than last year’s entire total. 

Today Italy's search and rescue services found six more bodies in the Mediterranean to add to the 19 people who drowned while a ship tried to make the crossing. 

The navy said it has now rescued almost 4,000 migrants over the weekend, with Italian vessels continuing to look for victims of a boat which capsized north of the Libyan coast on Sunday evening.

It comes after 200 migrants were feared to have drowned after a boat sank less than a mile from the coast of Libya  on Friday.

Investigators believe one in five want of those who travel to Port Augusta aim to end up in Britain.

The journey from Sicily to Dover can take a mere seven days, with some boarding trains towards Calais while others take the bus.   

Despite the death of an Afghan Sikh in a shipping container at Tilbury docks last week, hundreds are still determined to risk their lives to reach their destination by any means possible.

A man holds up his hands and gives the peace gesture to the camera after his arrival at Port Augusta. His journey into Europe could take him as far as the UK 

A young boy stares into the camera lens as he wraps his arms around his father's shoulders. Many families arrive on the shores together seeking a new life 

Men, women and children arrive at Italy's shores from all over the world. Some only have one bag on them while others just have the clothes on their backs

Paramedics are on standby to treat anyone taken ill during the journey. Last week an Afghan Sikh was found dead in a shipping container at Tilbury docks as he tried to cross from Zeebrugge, Belgium, into the UK 

Many migrants do not make it to the mainland without help from the authorities. These travellers are waiting to board the San Giusto Navy ship,  off the Sicilian island of Lampedusa, after being rescued at sea

After being rescued from the water or another vessel, they are loaded onto a navy ship, given life jackets, and made to huddle close together for the final leg of the trip

The Italian Interior Minister Angelino Alfano has renewed his demand for the European Union to relieve the pressure on Italy's naval services. They are called upon on a daily basis to save those who have failed in their attempt to cross the Mediterranean Sea

A group of men are crammed into a raft off the coast of Lampedusa. Some have to be rescued because rickety boats they travel in sink 

Once they board the ship, they will be taken to Sicily where their application for asylum will be considered
