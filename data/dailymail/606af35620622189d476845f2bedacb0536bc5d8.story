Aston Villa owner Randy Lerner has given his unequivocal backing to beleaguered manager Paul Lambert, whose two assistants have been suspended pending an investigation amid allegations of bullying.

The American billionaire praised Lambert’s ‘total loyalty and commitment’ to the club and acknowledged that the loss of Ian Culverhouse and Gary Karsa could have proved difficult for the Glaswegian.

But the removal of two people who were intrinsic to Lambert’s success at Norwich City and have formed part of his coaching team for the past eight years, dating back to Wycombe and Colchester, does leave him in a difficult position and desperate for a quick improvement in results.

Supportive: Aston Villa owner Randy Lerner has given his back to boss Paul Lambert after assistants Ian Culverhouse and Gary Karsa were suspended amid allegations of bullying

Lots to think about: Villa lost their fourth Premier League game on the spin at Crystal Palace on Saturday

As he approaches the end of his second
 season in charge at Villa Park, fans are questioning whether progress 
has been made.

They point to a record 10 home defeats as evidence that 
the club have stagnated.

Should that become 11 on Saturday when 
Southampton visit, then there is likely to be open revolt in the stands.

Lambert,
 44, relied on Culverhouse but has now turned to club legend Gordon 
Cowans, who has been promoted from development coach, and goalkeeper 
Shay Given, who in February stated that Villa ‘want me out of the door’.

The 37-year-old Republic of Ireland international has two years left on
 his contract but has not played a league game for the club since August
 2012.

Culverhouse was said 
to have cultivated a ‘poisonous’ atmosphere with his methods during 
training. Several players are believed to have grievances, with Fabian 
Delph and Gabriel Agbonlahor particularly upset at an incident in the 
week preceding the Fulham match.

Disappointed: Gabriel Agbonlahor was left out against Fulham but returned in the defeat at Palace

The defender started his career at Tottenham in 1982 but is best remembered for his time at Norwich.

During nine years at Carrow Road he played 370 times for the club, including in the famous win over Bayern Munich. He is in the Norwich City Hall of Fame.

He then moved on to Swindon and Brighton and after a spell youth coaching at various clubs became Paul Lambert's assistant at Colchester in 2008 before following the Scot to Norwich and then to Villa Park.

It
 is understood allegations of  bullying by Culverhouse and Karsa have 
been made by others who work at Villa, forcing chief executive Paul 
Faulkner to act.

The move 
was supported by Lambert, whose relationship with Culverhouse had broken
 down beyond repair and came to a head during the 1-0 defeat at Crystal 
Palace,  Villa’s fourth consecutive loss.

The
 players were told about the changes at training on Tuesday and the 
following session laid on by Cowans was said to be the ‘best in ages’.

Lerner
 said: ‘Our manager has been faced with some unexpected issues that 
could have very easily set the club back.

'In watching him handle 
matters, along with our chief exec, I’ve seen total loyalty and 
commitment to Aston Villa, while Gordon, a Villa man through and 
through, has repeatedly stepped up to support the club regardless of the
 ask.

Gary Karsa did not have a very distinguised playing career and his first coaching job came at Enfield in 1998, where he was football and community officer.

He then moved to Barnet (where he joined up with Ian Culverhouse) but his big break came when he became head of youth at Wycombe in 2006 under Paul Lambert.

He followed Lambert to Colchester, where he became football operations manager, and was part of the team that moved to Norwich and then Aston Villa.

‘Shay, too, has been 
unhesitating in answering the manager’s call. I couldn’t ask for more 
from people who are up for this challenge and the very real obstacles we
 have to overcome, as is everyone at the club.’

Villa
 lie 14th in the Barclays  Premier League with 34 points, four above the
 drop zone, and are fighting relegation for a second season under 
Lambert.

Fans were promised an exciting brand of football when he replaced Alex McLeish.

‘If
 they lose against Southampton, the atmosphere will turn,’ said David 
Michael, who runs the MyOldManSaid fan site and is a director at Aston 
Villa Supporters’ Trust.

‘This now is almost a trial. I can’t see the 
fans standing for him if we end up on anything below 40 points. His 
position may become untenable.’

Walking into trrouble? Fans have turned on Lambert, increasing the chances he could be leaving
