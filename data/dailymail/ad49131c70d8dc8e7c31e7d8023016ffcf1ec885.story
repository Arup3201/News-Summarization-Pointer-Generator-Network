There’s nothing like a Ryder Cup for lifting the profile of a player into the stratosphere. Just look at Ian Poulter.

Now here comes Europe’s latest hero Jamie Donaldson, long considered one of the best ball strikers on the European Tour but one who is going to have to get used to a whole new level of acclaim following his stunning performance at Gleneagles.

Three points out of four and clinching the winning point; who could have imagined that two years ago when he was paired with eventual winner Rory McIlroy in the third round of the USPGA Championship at Kiawah Island, and looked like a man painfully short of belief.

‘The game’s all in there but it’s a hard task getting him to feel like he belongs with these guys at this level,’ said one of his advisors. Then 36, it seemed questionable whether it would ever come out.

Ian Poulter has known him for 15 years and believes everything changed when the personable Welshman defeated a strong field to win in Abu Dhabi in January last year. ‘You could almost see him grow after that victory,’ said Poulter. ‘Since then he has been so consistent. He’s got some serious game.’

Donaldson circled the start of Ryder Cup qualifying in August last year. To that point he’d never considered it a possibility he could make the team but he knew this time he had a chance. In March, he played in the WGC-Cadillac Championship in Miami and racked up loads of qualifying points.

Poor performances at the Bridgestone Invitational and the PGA this August, however, left him in grave danger of missing out.

He rang captain Paul McGinley, who spelt it out in stark terms. ‘You’ve got to go and play the Czech Open and the Italian Open (the final two qualifying events),’ said the Dubliner. ‘I’ve got to be honest, the picks usually go to experienced players.’

The pressure was seriously on then, but how Donaldson delivered, winning the first of those events. He had shown he belonged.

Asked on the eve of the Ryder Cup what it was like to make his debut at the age of 38, he replied: ‘Everyone’s time is different. I was nowhere near the level of making the team in my 20s but my time is now.’ Donaldson was delighted when Lee Westwood was assigned to partner him. Their careers might have developed in different ways but the two men have a lot in common.

What a fine partnership it proved, with their two foursomes victories. They were a combined nine-under-par for those two matches and had just two bogeys.

So to the singles on Sunday, and a tough match in prospect against American firebrand Keegan Bradley. Donaldson never gave him a look-in. When it was over, he draped the Welsh flag over his shoulders and got rid of his inner racing-car driver by spraying his team-mates from a jeroboam of champagne.

‘It’s just been an amazing few weeks for me,’ he reflected. ‘I feel so lucky for it to have come down to my match for the winning point.’

With that, he stopped and a little moisture came to his eyes. As ever, his team-mates were ready to help him out when necessary. As one, they took the opportunity to break into a round of applause.

It was D-Day at Gleneagles and while there might never be one like this, there should be more great days for Donaldson in the years to come.
