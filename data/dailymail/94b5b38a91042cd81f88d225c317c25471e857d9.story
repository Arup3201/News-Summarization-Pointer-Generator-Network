Brazilian police solved a gangland execution after stopping a teenager for speeding, and discovering horrific footage of the killing on his mobile phone.

Motorist Levon Valencia Puga, 16, was found to have no driving licence and was driving a car that did not belong to him, and as a result police decided to arrest him and take him in for questioning.

But back at the police station when they checked his mobile phone, they found a video which showed the shocking execution of another teenager who was killed for apparently being a snitch.

Horrific: Footage police found on a mobile phone shows Marcos Vinicius Caixeta Monteiro being executed, with one of the suspects filmed stamping on his head

Shocking: The teenager tried desperately to get away but was gunned down as he fled

 The killing took place in a remote area on the outskirts of the municipality of Goiania

Executed: The boy is shot at point-blank range in the head

The shocking video shows teenager Marcos Vinicius Caixeta Monteiro, 18, in the back of a car with three other men. The car has been identified as Monteiro's own vehicle, and he had apparently been forced into the back by the trio who are then seen driving to a remote area on the outskirts of the municipality of Goiania, in the central Brazilian state of Goias.

The teenager looks extremely worried after the trio tell him he is going to die because he is a snitch, and had given information to police that led to a criminal being arrested. 

When the car stops, he climbs out and tries to run away from the vehicle off-camera before three shots ring out.

Cold-blooded: The clip shows a hand gun being loaded with bullets

Scared: Monteiro looks extremely worried as the men tell him that he is going to die for being a snitch

The video then shows one of the three men walking up to the young man lying on the ground, who is clutching his head, and stamping on him repeatedly. 

They then reload the gun before a second man shoots him point-blank range in the head, with at least one of the bullets missing and thudding into the earth. They then walk back to the car, discussing everything calmly as if nothing has happened.

Puga is heard on the video saying: 'Go with God'.

A police spokesman confirmed the arrest and said they were still trying to identify and arrest the other two men shown in the video.

Local police chief Kleyton Manoel Dias said: 'One of the most shocking things about this case is that the arrested driver really didn't seem bothered when the video was discovered. He was completely calm and described what happened, and gave all the detail we wanted without showing any emotion at all.'

The family of the dead teenager meanwhile said they wanted justice and added: 'He did not deserve to die like this.'
