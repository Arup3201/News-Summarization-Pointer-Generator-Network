He may have just committed himself to returning to Arsenal one day, but Gunners legend Thierry Henry will have worried his supporters with a bizarre choice of head-wear this week.

The Frenchman, who announced he was leaving New York Red Bulls this week, was spotted in the club's dressing room wearing a Spurs bobble hat.

Fortunately for Arsene Wenger, who has hinted Henry could return to the Emirates Stadium as a coach, the former Arsenal striker has not switched allegiances to north London rivals Tottenham.

Arsenal's record scorer was actually wearing a piece of San Antonio Spurs merchandise, an NBA franchise that Henry supports.

The 37-year-old Gunners legend was filmed wearing the hat as he said goodbye to his  Red Bulls team-mates after his final game.

They lost to the New England Revolution on aggregate last weekend in the MLS play-offs, after which Henry announced he was leaving New York.
