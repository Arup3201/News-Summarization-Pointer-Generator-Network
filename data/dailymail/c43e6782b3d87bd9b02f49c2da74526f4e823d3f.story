Actors Jude Law, Kim Cattrall and Naomie Harris, One Show television presenter Alex Jones, model David Gandy and Saturdays singer Mollie King are among those who have captured images of UK locations with a special meaning to them.

The National Trust said it had conducted research in which that 84 per cent of people said they have a favourite place they go to which has a positive impact on their well-being and happiness.

Four out of five people said visiting their favourite place had a bigger impact on their well-being than shopping or going to the cinema.
