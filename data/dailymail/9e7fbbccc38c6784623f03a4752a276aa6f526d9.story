Olivier Giroud scored two first-half goals to ensure Arsenal came away from their game against Newcastle with all three points.

French striker Giroud struck twice inside four minutes to grab the Gunners a cushion going in to the break at St James' Park.

The hosts managed just one shot in the opening 45, but grabbed a route back into the game when Moussa Sissoko netted just after the break.

However, it was a case of too little too late for Newcastle as they failed to break through a stubborn Arsenal defence.

Olivier Giroud celebrates scoring Arsenal's first goal against Newcastle in the Premier League on Saturday

NEWCASTLE (4-1-4-1)

TIM KRUL 6 – Dutchman had little chance with either of the Arsenal goals but otherwise looked solid behind a makeshift defence.

RYAN TAYLOR 6.5 – Sound defensively, getting in a good early block on Sanchez, and launched the attack for Newcastle’s goal with a lovely nutmeg

Danny Welbeck and Ryan Taylor do battles as both vie for the ball during the battle at St James' Park

DARYL JANMAAT 6.5 – Pressed into action as an emergency centre-back in the absence of Fabricio Coloccini, and the full-back coped well on the whole.

MIKE WILLIAMSON 5.5 - Can’t claim to have come off best in his duel with Giroud and was too busy trying to wrestle the Frenchman when he headed in the second.

JACK COLBACK 5.5 – First touch let him down on a couple of occasions, not least when he ended up conceding the freekick that led to Arsenal’s first goal

Newcastle United's Spanish striker Ayoze Perez vies for the ball with Arsenal defender Gabriel Paulista

VURNON ANITA 5 – Guilty of playing Colback into trouble on the first goal, and looked vulnerable at times. Replaced by Gutierrez with 20 minutes left

MOUSSA SISSOKO 7 – Stylish finish to get Newcastle back in the game and went close to an equaliser with a flick header. A real threat.

SAMMY AMEOBI 5.5 – Had his moments but tended to drift in and out of the game. A little better in the second half.

YOAN GOUFFRAN 6 – Another one who struggled to make an impact. Should have done better than poke an effort straight at Ospina from eight yards out in the 60th minute.

REMY CABELLA 7 – Really came alive in the second half and did well to pick out Sissoko for the Newcastle goal.

AYOZE PEREZ 7 – An isolated figure in the first half but had more support after the interval and went close with a wonderful curling effort.

Subs: Gutierrez (Anita 72), Elliot, Obertan, Riviere, Armstrong (for Ameobi 89), Satka, Kemen.

Scorer: Sissoko 48

Booked: none

Moussa Sissoko of Newcastle United scores to halve the deficit against Arsenal in the Premier League match

ARSENAL (4-2-3-1)

DAVID OSPINA 7 – Kicked the ball more than he handled it in the first half such was the lack of threat from Newcastle, but called upon to make some important saves after half-time.

CALUM CHAMBERS 6 – Like the rest of Arsenal’s defence, coasted through the first half but ended up hanging on towards the end. Rarely put a foot wrong though.

GABRIEL PAULISTA 6 – One of three changes from the Monaco game in midweek and looked solid enough on his return to the line-up.

LAURENT KOSCIELNY 6.5 – Dealt comfortably with Perez in the first half but more of a battle after that, and got a punch in the back of the head from Ospina for his troubles.

NACHO MONREAL 5.5 – Strolled through the first half but had his hands full after that as Cabella and Perez stepped up their game.

FRANCIS COQUELIN 7 – Did well snuffing out any trouble in midfield and spilt blood for the cause after a bang in the face, ending the game in a blank shirt.

AARON RAMSEY 7 – Wasted an early chance when he was guilty of a heavy first touch but kept things over nicely and orchestrated many of Arsenal’s best moves.

ALEXIS SANCHEZ 6 – Couple of sublime touches but subdued by his standards and replaced by Tomas Rosicky towards the end.

SANTI CAZORLA 6.5 – Picked up two more assists as he delivered the set-pieces for both Giroud’s goals. Otherwise, the Spaniard was effective without ever setting the game alight.

DANNY WELBECK 6.5 – Got the flick-on for Giroud’s first goal but had few opportunities himself. Never stopped driving at the Newcastle defence.

OLIVIER GIROUD 8 – Scored both Arsenal’s goals, making it eight in six against Newcastle. They will be glad to see the back of the Frenchman for another season.

Subs: Szczesny, Gibbs, Mertesacker, Rosicky (for Sanchez 71), Walcott, Flamini (for Cazorla 71), Bellerin (for Welbeck 89)

Scorer: Giroud 24, 28
