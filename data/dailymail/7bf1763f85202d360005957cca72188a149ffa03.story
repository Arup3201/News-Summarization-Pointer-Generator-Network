For almost 20 years, Dame Catherine Cookson was the most popular author in British libraries, with more copies of her novels borrowed than any other writer.

But she has suffered a massive drop in popularity – not even managing to make the top ten most popular authors of the past nine years.

Out with the old: Cookson's popularity has waned

And in the latest annual charts, for 2010-2011, she ranked a lowly 147th in the list of most borrowed writers, as readers find her work – inspired by her illegitimate childhood and grinding poverty in the North East – increasingly irrelevant. Instead they are opting for ‘grittier’ crime novels by authors such as James Patterson. 

Ms Cookson’s spectacular fall from popularity is detailed in figures that have been obtained from the Public Lending Right, which distributes library royalties to authors. 

She made the top 20 authors in only three of the past nine years, with around 3.5million of her titles lent over that time. It is a far cry from 1997, when nine of the top ten most popular library books were hers.

The figures are the second blow to Cookson’s reputation in less than  a year, after South Tyneside Council decided to drop its ‘outdated’ Catherine Cookson Country tourist slogan.

South Tyneside mayor Eileen Leask, 64, said Cookson’s popularity was on the wane as a new generation of readers found it hard to relate to her. 

She said: ‘I don’t think it’s something we should be too upset about because she had her day and she brought  history to life.

'I think people my age could actually connect with the stories in a certain way, but times have changed and people have moved on.

‘Her books tended to be the same story every time and they were based on certain types of characters, such  as the strong woman bringing up her  family against the odds.

'She had a very hard life, partly because she was illegitimate, but that is a stigma people simply can’t relate to any more.’

Cookson was the most borrowed author in Britain for 17 consecutive years from 1984 to 2000, but she fell off the top ten in 2005.

And from 2002 to 2011, she ranks No 15.

A new chapter: Authors such as James Patterson have overtaken Cookson in the popularity stakes

Dr Jim Parker, registrar of the  Public Lending Right, said: ‘I suspect a couple of things are going on.

Her death in 1998 means there are no new books and our experience is that if you are not getting books on to the shelves, then popularity fades away.  

Top ten: The most borrowed authors

‘Another reason is a change of taste.

We have seen the growing popularity of what we might call gritty crime thrillers, both Scandinavian and American.

Authors like James Patterson are mopping up at the moment.

‘It was my mother’s generation who liked the Cookson books.

There is  a slight datedness about them now.’

Patterson, the American thriller writer, has topped the annual list for the past five years.

The author, who signed a reported $150 million (£95 million) publishing deal in 2009, has achieved 14 million loans since 2002.

He has replaced Dame Jacqueline Wilson, the children’s writer and creator of the Tracy Beaker stories as Britain’s most borrowed author –  at the top of the annual list, although over the past nine years as a whole, Wilson narrowly takes the top slot.

Harry Potter author J. K. Rowling is  a noticeable absentee from the list of the most borrowed authors.

Dr Parker said that was probably because she had written only a handful of titles.

Britain’s 4,500 libraries make about 300 million loans a year and British-based authors receive an average of 6p a time, capped at £6,600 a year.
