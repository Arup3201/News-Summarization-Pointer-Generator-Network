A former soldier is facing his last Christmas with his children after being refused a life-prolonging cancer drug because he lives in the wrong town.

Mark Bannister’s long battle with cancer has culminated in a fight for the drug Avastin which his consultant said could give him vital time with his daughter Sophie, six, and son Thomas, five.

But NHS bosses have refused to fund the medicine, even though it is readily available to patients just 15 miles from where Mr Bannister lives in Gainsborough, Lincolnshire.

'They are playing God': Mark Bannister, pictured with his wife Karen with their children Sophie and Thomas, has been denied access to the drug Avastin to treat his brain cancer

The 37-year-old was first diagnosed with a brain tumour in 2003.

He was told in August this year that his cancer had spread and that Avastin, which costs £21,000 for a 
ten-month course, was his last hope.

His doctor gave him just 12 months to live.

The former private, who completed 
tours in Northern Ireland and Bosnia during nine years with the Army, 
said: 'I was hoping the drug would help me see another couple of 
Christmases.

'I love my 
family to bits and want to be able to spend as much time as I can with 
them. It wouldn’t be a cure, but it would be the best thing to prolong 
my life.

'This Christmas we are just going to try and make as many memories as we can as it will probably be my last one.'

His wife Karen added: 'It’s devastating that they haven’t said yes to this treatment, we just can’t understand it.

'It should just be that everyone is given the same access to treatment regardless of where they live.

'It just seems so unfair that if we lived in Scunthorpe, which is only 15 miles away, we would get it.'

Mr Bannister was first diagnosed with a benign tumour in 2003 when he was 29, which was removed through open brain surgery.

Doctors
told the couple that the tumour would probably return and routine scans
in 2006 found the tumour had come back - only this time it was 
malignant.

Mr Bannister underwent another operation to remove it, followed by six months of radiotherapy.

Then
in January 2010, another tumour was discovered and further open brain 
surgery carried out, followed by nine months of chemotherapy.

Despite all the treatment, the tumour
returned aggressively in January this year and it was discovered in 
August that further chemotherapy treatment had not worked.

It
was at that point Mr Bannister said his consultant suggested Avastin, a
tumour-starving therapy that works by preventing the blood vessels 
reaching the tumour.

But letters to the Cancer Drugs Fund as well as East Midlands Specialised Commissioning Group were knocked back.

The drug is not currently 'readily approved' as a treatment by the National Institute of Clinical Excellence (Nice), which means funding for it sits with the Cancer Drugs Fund.

NHS Lincolnshire said decisions to 
fund treatments are based on clear clinical evidence, 
cost-effectiveness, the benefit to patient and consideration of national
guidance.

A spokesman 
from EMSCG said: 'We were sorry to hear about this patient’s individual 
circumstances. Unfortunately, we are unable to comment further on 
individual cases.

'Currently,
Avastin is not readily approved by Nice guidance and therefore funding 
for treatment that falls outside of Nice sits with Cancer Drugs Fund.

'Decisions about whether to fund drugs from the Cancer Drugs Fund are made solely by cancer specialists.'

NHS East Midlands does not fund Avastin for brain cancer patients, but NHS Yorkshire and the Humber does.

This
means it is available for patients just 15 miles away in Scunthorpe, 
and in Sheffield where Mark had all of his cancer treatment, but not in 
Gainsborough.

Mr Bannister said: 'I’m just so angry that people can play with your life by saying who can and can’t have treatment.

'They are playing God.'

With
an uncertain future ahead of them, Mr and Mrs Bannister renewed their
vows last month on their tenth wedding anniversary.
