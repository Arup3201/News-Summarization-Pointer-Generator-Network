A grandmother and her granddaughter were showered in glass after an explosion sent a gas canister flying through her living room window.

Joan Roberts, 85, was watching the news when the butane canister flew 20ft from a van outside into her home.

The force of the blast caused thousands of pounds worth of damage to the property in Knutton, Staffordshire.

Explosion: The gas canister flew through the window of this living room as Joan Roberts, 85, was watching television with her granddaughter Rebecca

The woman and her granddaughter Rebecca were able to escape before a neighbour dialled 999.

Emergency services were called to the scene but the grandmother escaped serious injury because the canister missed her head by 'a matter of inches' and landed in the kitchen.

Two men, aged 27 and 29, from Newcastle-under-Lyme, Staffs., were arrested on suspicion of causing an explosion.

Damage: The smashed window in the property in Knutton, Staffordshire. The bill for internal damage is estimated to run into thousands of pounds

Staffordshire Police are trying to establish what caused the canister to explode in the back of a van which was parked outside the retirement housing complex.

A force spokesman said: 'Fortunately, no-one was seriously injured in this extremely unusual incident but extensive damage has been caused to the property.

'We have carried out initial inquiries including a forensic examination of the inside of the flat and the canister itself.

'We will also need to examine the van and will be speaking to a number of witnesses.'

The grandmother is now staying with relatives while repairs to her home are carried out.

Resident Joyce Evans, 56, said: 'It was like a bomb going off.

'Apparently the lady was watching the evening news with her granddaughter and had just sat down when the canister flew past her head by a matter of inches.

'A second earlier and she would have been it's path and it could have taken her head off.

'It's a miracle she was okay.'

Neighbour Mark Crutchey, 50, added that the explosion could have killed someone.

'I just heard a loud bang and glass shattering,' he said.

'It looks like the canister didn't just go through the glass, it managed to smash through the actual frame of the window, so it just goes to show the force.

Probe: Police are investigating the incident and have arrested two men on suspicion of causing an explosion

Surprise: Pensioner Joan Roberts, 85, was playing bingo with friends just a few hours after the gas canister flew through her window

'It's a miracle that no-one was badly hurt, it easily could have killed someone.'

After narrowly escaping injury, Mrs Roberts was playing bingo with friends just a few hours later.

A friend said yesterday: 'Joan maybe old but she's a character and she was playing bingo and laughing just after the explosion.

'She was obviously shaken by what had happened but was just relieved her granddaughter Rebecca wasn't hurt.

'I think it all happened so fast she didn't know how close she had come to being hit by the canister.

'It's such a strange thing to happen but knowing her she'll probably be laughing about it in a few weeks.'
