Footage has emerged from Russia showing a meteor exploding as it enters the atmosphere and lighting up the night sky.

In the short clip, recorded on a car's dash camera, a bright object can be seen streaking across the sky before breaking into pieces and disappearing.

The scenes are reminiscent of the 2013 Russian meteor which exploded in the sky over Chelyabinsk, shattering glass in nearby buildings and injuring 1,200 people.

Dashcam footage has emerged of a suspected meteor exploding over the Russian region of Murmansk

The the footage, shot just after 2.10am local time, shows a bright light appearing in the sky above a road

Some have cast doubt on the new extra-terrestrial object, pointing out that Russia has a military base nearby and it could simply be a missile test, but no long range tests were scheduled for that evening.

Witnesses in Russia's northern Murmansk region say that, unlike the previous meteor, there was no audible explosion when the bright object appeared at roughly 2.10pm local time.

The Chelyabinsk meteor, which crashed to Earth in February 2013 weighed 10,000 tonnes, according to scientists, and was 55ft wide.

When it exploded the force was so great it sent shockwaves around the world twice before punching a 50ft-wide hole in the surface of a frozen lake.

The light flares up, illuminating the surrounding buildings, before disintegrating and fading away

While many believe the object to be a meteor, others have pointed out that the Russian military have a base nearby and have suggested that it could be a missile test

The tremors from the explosion above Chelyabinsk city were recorded at around 20 monitoring stations across the world.

The stations are part of the International Monitoring System network operated by the Comprehensive Nuclear-Test-Ban Treaty Organisation.

Collectors were quick to the scene where 
they collected fragments of space rock before trying to sell them 
online, some reportedly fetching thousands of pounds.

Earlier this year Russia included 
fragment of the meteor in medals which they handed out at the Sochi 
winter Olympics to mark the anniversary of the rock falling to Earth.

A meteor occurs when an object from space, usually rock, gets dragged into the Earth's atomosphere by gravity, burning up as it encounters friction.

The clip is similar to dashcam footage captured in 2013 of a meteor exploding above Chelyabinsk

On that occasion a huge explosion blew out glass in surrounding buildings, injuring 1,200 people. Witnesses to the latest 'meteor' say there was no sound as the object fell to earth
