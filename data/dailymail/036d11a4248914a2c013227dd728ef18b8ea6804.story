A 16-year-old burglar was caught on camera squeezing through an open window before stealing a laptop.

The youngster, who cannot be named, struggled through the window and filmed ransacking the student bedroom.

As he quickly searched the room, he came within inches of a hidden camera set up by West Midlands Police.

The force has used a number of decoy 'capture' houses to try and catch burglars red-handed.

Motion sensors, mini cameras and coded dye has been hidden within the room.

The teenage burglar hauled himself through the window of the student room at the University of Wolverhampton after accomplice Zak Harris, 39, gave him a leg up.

Harris can be heard shouting orders at the boy and telling him what to steal during the March 2 break-in.

The 16-year-old grabs the laptop and a mobile phone before climbing back out of the window.

Neither Harris nor the boy realised they had been caught on camera and were arrested hours later after being recognised by local officers.

On Friday, Harris was ordered to carry
out 60 hours of unpaid work at Wolverhampton Crown Court after pleading
guilty to burglary.

The teenager was given a 9-month 
referral order at the city's youth court a week earlier after he also 
admitted breaking into the property.

West Midlands Police said it was increasingly using hi-tech infra red spy cameras to catch criminals.

Detective Sergeant Andy Padmore, from the Wolverhampton CID burglary team, said: 'The technology used in capture houses may sound like something from a spy film, but is in fact technology we use quite often.

'The tiny cameras mean that everyday household items suddenly become the eyes and ears of the police.

'The equipment is portable and easy to
install, meaning any home in a hot spot area can be quickly converted 
to capture burglars.

'The cameras also work on infra-red meaning we can download crystal clear images even at night.'

The tactics are being used in areas where burglaries are more common.

DS Padmore said the force wanted to send out a message to burglars and the public.

He said: 'We are sending a 
clear message to criminals - commit burglary in Wolverhampton and you 
will be caught.

'Secondly, we aim to reassure the people of Wolverhampton that we are 
working together with partners and the public in a number of innovative 
ways to protect them.'
