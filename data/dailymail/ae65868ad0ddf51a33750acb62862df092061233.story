The elderly should be encouraged to sacrifice part of their pension lump sum or to downsize their home to pay for their care, two Liberal Democrat ministers said yesterday.

Norman Lamb, the Care and Support Minister, said people could enter into deals under which they receive a smaller payout on retirement.

The rest would go towards an insurance scheme to cover their needs in old age, such as care home fees and home help costs.

Steve Webb, the Pensions Minister, suggested that the elderly could free up cash by moving into smaller homes.

The comments, made to a Lords select committee inquiry into the effect of demographic change on public services, are  likely to infuriate pensioners’ groups who say it is unfair that those who have paid taxes all their lives should not be guaranteed a decent income in old age.

They come amid continued confusion over the future of elderly care funding. Ministers have accepted the principle of a cap on the amount someone would be expected to pay, as recommended by economist Andrew Dilnot.

But they are yet to say the level at which the ceiling will be set. Mr Dilnot suggested a figure of around £35,000. There are rumours the Government may set a figure of £75,000.

Mr Lamb told the committee that during talks with Mr Dilnot he had been told that the presence of a cap would give financial services companies the certainty to come forward with insurance products to reduce the cost still further.

These could also fund ‘top-up’ care, where people would be able to live in better quality care homes than their council will fund.

Of his proposal, Mr Webb said: ‘I certainly think there is a lot more could be done on trading down, although this is incredibly sensitive territory.’

Mr Webb told the committee that, with life expectancy rates rising, the era of people retiring in their late 50s was over.

Last night Ros Altmann, director general of over-50s group Saga, said: ‘For a lot of people, their home is not just an asset –it is part of the family. And t hey want to pass it on to their children. For these people, trading down is not an option.’

Iain Duncan Smith plans to slash winter fuel payments to pensioners living abroad.

The Work and Pensions Secretary is considering imposing a ‘temperature test’ that would see expatriate pensioners in countries with warmer average winter temperatures lose part – or all – of the cash.

Last year, the taxpayer funded payments of £12.8million to 74,685 expats in countries such as Greece, Italy and Spain.

Figures obtained by the Daily Mail show that the cost has risen 13-fold in the past decade.

The money has to be paid because EU directives say national governments must do nothing to stop freedom of movement in the community, or to discriminate on grounds of age.

A source said: ‘Clearly it is crazy that pensioners living in hot places in Europe should be receiving winter fuel payments.’
