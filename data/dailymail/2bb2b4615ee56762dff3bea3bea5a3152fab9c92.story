Passengers on an American Airlines flight from Los Angeles and New York were surprised with the first ever film premiere at 30,000 feet.

After checking in at LAX yesterday, the passengers, bound for New York, were told that they would be receiving a special kind of in-flight entertainment.

And after young actor Quvenzhane Wallis and director Will Gluck boarded the plane, they found they were to be treated to a showing of the brand new adaptation of Annie before it's even released at the cinema.

Raja Rajamannar from Mastercard explained: 'Today's surprise is just one way we're taking our Pricesless Surprises to a whole new level by bringing in new platforms to drive cardholder affinity.

'You truly never know when or where a surprise can happen.'

The movie, which is based on the stage play of the same name, sees the title character Annie as an orphan who is determined to make her own way on the streets of New York in 2014.

Cameron Diaz stars as her mean foster mother Miss Hannigan while the character of Daddy Warbucks is played by Jamie Foxx.

The advanced screening of the movie comes just days after the film, by Sony Pictures Entertainment, was being illegally shared online after a cyber attack allegedly committed by North Korea.

The attack allegedly knocked out Sony Pictures Entertainment's entire computer network earlier this week, with staff reduced to working off white boards because their laptops and PC were rendered useless.

The hack comes just under a month before Sony Pictures is due to release The Interview, which is a comedy about two journalists, played by Rogen and Franco, who are recruited by the CIA to assassinate North Korean leader Kim Jong Un.

The Pyongyang government denounced the film as 'undisguised sponsoring of terrorism, as well as an act of war' in a letter to U.N. Secretary-General Ban Ki-moon in June.

Representatives of the North Korean mission to the United Nations could not immediately be reached for comment about the cyber attack.
