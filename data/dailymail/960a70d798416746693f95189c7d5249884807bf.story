Sam Burgess speaks matter-of-factly about the moment, barely 10 seconds into the NRL Grand Final, when a sickening clash of heads with fellow Englishman James Graham shattered his right eye socket and cheekbone.

‘I put my hand to my face and knew straight away something had been broken,’ the cross-code star told MailSport this week.

‘I could feel my jaw was out of shape and I felt the pain straight away. There was a sharp stinging down my face. It was like when you break your arm. It didn’t really cross my mind to stop playing. It’s not every day you get to play in a Grand Final. I just got on with it.’

Not only did Burgess ‘just get on with it’, he produced a man-of-the-match display in his final game of rugby league before switching codes after the South Sydney Rabbitohs won their first Grand Final in 43 years.

The performance prompted an outpouring of praise from an Australian public usually loath to hand out accolades to English sporting heroes.

‘People talk about Sam becoming the greatest English forward to ever come to Australia,’ said Rabittohs chief executive Shane Richardson.

‘The reality is he could be one of the greatest forwards to have ever played the game.’

The 25-year-old’s courage, indeed some would say foolhardiness, in playing on earned Burgess a place in rugby league folklore while showing why Bath and England had been so keen to lure him back to England before next year’s World Cup here.

The prospect of the 6ft 5in 18st wrecking machine, who combines outstanding physical prowess with quick feet, deft hands and a commitment to tackling which sometimes borders on the reckless, wearing the red rose of England excites head coach Stuart Lancaster.

Speak to those who know Burgess, among them Rabbitohs owner Russell Crowe, and they talk of a fiercely driven individual who places family above all else.

The death of his father Mark from motor neurone disease affected his outlook on life and informs the decisions he takes today. ‘Losing my dad taught me a lot about life,’ said Burgess who, as a teenager, used to carry his stricken father to bed in the final years before his premature death at the age of just 47.

‘Motor neurone disease is a pretty devastating disease. It was obviously a shock to the family. I look back on those days now and I’m able to take plenty of joy from the time we spent together in his last days. It definitely shaped me as a young man. I was 16 or 17 and it taught me a lot about things. 

'It puts a lot of things in perspective and it’s why I don’t take anything for granted. I’m very grateful for everything I’ve got. Not just being able to play sport for a job but to be healthy and be able to give something back to a few people is quite rewarding.

‘I’d like to think I’ve already overcome quite a few big hurdles in life. When you face something like losing a parent you learn to realise what is real and what is not. You learn what should actually affect you and what you can just brush off.

‘As a professional sportsman we’re in an incredibly fortunate position so we should never complain, although I still do sometimes, but you learn a lot going through things like that. But I really do believe it has helped shaped me into what I do today.’

Unveiled as a Bath player on Thursday after landing in England on Wednesday, the former Bradford Bull, who convinced a sceptical Australian public he was the real deal, must now attempt to grasp the technical aspects of union — the ruck and maul among them — which have been gradually removed from league over more than a century of professionalism.

He must do so away from his mum Julie and brothers Luke, George and Tom, who have stayed in Sydney. His girlfriend Phoebe will join him in Bath in the next few weeks.

Bath head coach Mike Ford, a forerunner in the wave of former league players and coaches who have flooded the union market since professionalism in 1996, will not attempt to mould Burgess into a ‘traditional’ union player and remains relaxed about his best position.

Whether he ends up in the back row or midfield when fully recovered from the complicated surgery which left him with five metal plates in his face following the NRL Final, Burgess can be sure of a warm welcome when he makes his union bow.

But he’s used to that. ‘Slammin Sam’ has shown he is no shrinking violet. ‘What makes a good sportsman is that competitive edge,’ he said.

‘It separates the good from the great. I’m not saying I’m great but I’ve been around teams for 10 seasons now and you see a lot of different characters and personalities. You can see why people succeed through their character traits.

‘I’ve been targeted in league for years so I’ll be ready for what comes at me in union. I’m well used to it, believe me.’

Burgess had dinner with his new team-mates George Ford and Kyle Eastmond on his first night in his new city. It was perhaps no surprise he should seek out two players with rugby league backgrounds in an Aviva Premiership club which arguably has been influenced more by the rival code than any other.

He trained with his new team-mates on Friday but is unlikely to make his first-team debut until mid- to late December; nine months before the World Cup.

It seems a huge challenge but Burgess will take it in his stride.

‘I think the biggest challenge I’ve faced in my career was leaving England and moving to Australia [in 2010] to play in the NRL, the toughest competition in rugby league,’ he said. ‘I thought that was a bigger challenge than coming back over here.

‘I know people over here. Fordy and the boys. I didn’t know anyone over there. This is big in its own right. Playing rugby union is going to be fun and I’m going to have a great time in a new city.

‘I’m just going to enjoy it. I won’t let the pressure mount up on me. We’ll see how I get on in time.’
