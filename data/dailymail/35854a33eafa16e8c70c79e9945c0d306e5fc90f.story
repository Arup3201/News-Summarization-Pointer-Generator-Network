Winner Anacona claimed victory on stage nine of the Vuelta a Espana as Nairo Quintana inherited the red jersey and Chris Froome lost time in the general classification.

The overall standings ahead of the first rest day see previous front-runner Alejandro Valverde (Movistar) having slipped to third, eight seconds off the top, and fellow Spaniard Alberto Contador (Tinkoff-Saxo) up to second, three seconds behind new leader Quintana.

Colombia's Anacona (Lampre-Merida) is fourth, trailing compatriot Quintana (Movistar) by nine seconds, while Briton Froome (Team Sky) - 20 seconds off the lead on Saturday - has dropped a place to fifth and is now 28 seconds back.

Red leader: Nairo Quintana celebrates taking the red jersey at stage nine of the Vuelta a Espana

Anacona was part of a large breakaway that built up a healthy advantage over the peloton, and the Lampre-Merida man made his move off the front in a bid to put himself back in the GC picture after losing time earlier in the race.

And he did just that, finishing more than two minutes ahead of the top names to slot in to fourth place overall, nine seconds back from Quintana after Sunday's stage, which ran a total of 185km from Carboneras de Guadazaon to Aramon Valdelinares.

Team Sky had set a searing pace as they led the peloton up the first-category climb in the pouring rain, but Contador sparked a series of attacks from the general classification contenders and Froome could not followed as he was distanced inside the final kilometre.

After finishing the stage 18th, Froome said on www.teamsky.com: 'Conditions were really tough out there.

'I think we can take a lot of good away from that stage in terms of how we rode as a team.

'I'm so, so proud of how the guys rode today, they did such a good job. They kept me at the front throughout the stage.

'In the final I didn't have the legs to follow the top guys when they went.

'But I think given where I've come from on the back of the Tour (de France) and the build-up into the race I'm really happy with how things have gone so far.

'I can definitely feel I'm starting to pick up that race rhythm back into my legs and I'm looking forward to the second half of this race.'

He added: 'It's a huge fight here and it's going to be a big race all the way to the end. Every second here or there is going to count.'
