He's battled the Taliban in Afghanistan, launched the Invictus Games for disabled servicemen and turned out to support charities across the world: Prince Harry, or Prince Henry of Wales to give him his proper title, has certainly managed to pack a lot into his 30 years.

But it hasn't all been charming crowds and doing his bit for the country - there have been more than a few lighter moments along the way. Who, after all, could forget his 'win' against Usain Bolt during a visit to Jamaica in 2012 or his cheeky quips at his brother's expense?

From the hilarious highs to the heartbreaking lows, Femail rounds up some of Prince Harry's biggest moments at he hits the big 3-0.
