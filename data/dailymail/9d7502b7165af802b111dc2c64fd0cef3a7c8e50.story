If you, like millions of others, are seduced by Amazon deals when shopping for that shiny new kitchen appliance or camera, beware.

It turns out that some of those tempting savings are not quite as good as advertised.

The world’s largest online retailer and rivals Argos and Currys have been accused of making bogus claims of bargains on kitchen appliances and other electrical goods.

Cheap: But Amazon is accused of exaggerating the savings it offers on many electrical appliances

All three boasted of big discounts on washing machines, cameras and irons – coaxing shoppers with savings on ‘original’ prices – but which actually offered little or no real saving.

The Office of Fair Trading had already put retailers on notice, threatening legal action and fines over attempts to fool shoppers with fake price cuts.

Now research by Which? has found a series of examples in which retailers apparently failed to play straight with families seeking value for money.

The consumer champion tracked prices for more than five months at the three retailers, the UK’s biggest sellers of electrical and white goods.

Bargain? A Canon Powershot camera similar to this one was said to be £130 cheaper than its RRP on Amazon, but in fact was just £30 less than normal

Deals: A Morphy Richards steam iron, left, and Zanussi washing machine, right, were also involved

It found some of the original prices they used as the benchmark for price-cut claims were long out of date.

Some also used what they claimed was a recommended retail price for a kitchen appliance as the basis for the claim of a big price reduction.

However, Which? found the true manufacturer’s recommended price was often lower – with the result the saving was less than claimed.

For example, Amazon advertised a Canon Powershot camera for £198.86, which it claimed was a saving of £130.14 against the RRP of £329. In fact the manufacturer was selling the camera for £229, which meant the saving was a more modest £30.14.

Misleading: Currys promised to investigate the anomalies unearthed by Which? magazine

Sale: Argos claimed an iron was on offer, but it was available from the manufacturer for the same price

Morphy Richards eco steam iron (40625) - Argos Claim: Sale price of £29.99 - Save £10Reality: No saving on the £29.99 charged by Morphy Richards

Argos sold a Morphy Richards steam iron 
for £29.99, which it claimed was a price cut of £10. But this ‘offer 
price’ was actually the same as the manufacturer’s own retail price.

Which? executive director Richard Lloyd said: ‘When household budgets are squeezed it is unacceptable that shoppers are confused into thinking that they’re getting a good deal when that might not be the case.’

Amazon said it has updated the RRP prices on the two cameras highlighted by Which?, and said it liaises with manufacturers to provide the most up to date information to shoppers.

Currys thanked Which? and promised to investigate the price anomalies it highlighted.

Argos said it ‘strongly refuted any suggestion that its deals are not genuine’.

The firm said its offers fully comply with official guidance.

OFT chief executive Clive Maxwell  said: ‘Shoppers should be able to trust that special offers and promotions really are bargains.’
