This is the adorable moment a hungry raccoon exercises a degree of caution as he's offered a treat.

Video footage, viewed more than two million times, shows the furry animal hiding in a hollowed-out out tree trunk.

Then, as a piece of food is presented, he cautiously reaches his small paws forwards.

With his eyes on the prize, he delicately clutches the nibble tight.

Bystanders are heard laughing in the background as they watch the timid critter in action.

Once he's got his treat, the raccoon retreats back into his hidey-hole.

The heartwarming clip was filmed by Russian YouTube user, lgreko100. 

It was captured at an unknown location last year and recently resurfaced.
