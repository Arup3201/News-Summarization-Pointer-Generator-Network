A bouncer has revealed he used pepper spray on Jeremy Kyle outside a Magaluf nightclub because he believed the TV presenter was making the resort look bad.

The TV host was sprayed while he was filming the bars and nightclubs for a special series of his ITV talk show.

The series, which will air next year, includes one episode which focuses on the 'youth culture' in Magaluf.

Jeremy Kyle was pepper sprayed by a nightclub bouncer while he was filming a TV documentary in Magaluf

But a 40-year-old 
Romanian nightclub bouncer called Leon took exception to Kyle's 'commercial rubbish' - and decided to take matters into his own hands.

The man last night revealed how he carried out the attack outside Bonkers
 Bar because Kyle was 'making Magaluf look s***' - when it is 'actually a nice place to live'.

Leon - who said he would happily spray Kyle again - told the Tab: 'He was walking down the strip with camera making it look sh*t. He wasn't showing the good side of Magaluf.

'I don't like that sort of publicity - it's not good. It's been happening for a while now and it's definitely not the way to promote a place. He ran away behind the corner.

'I don't like the way he portrays the place. We're like family here - we clean everything and keep it that way.

'It's actually a nice place to live which is why you find lots of families here with their kids being raised here.'

One witness said: 'Kyle was on the island filming God knows what. Suddenly outside of the window of my DJ booth I see a mass crowd and chanting going up the street.

'I look outside, and there's a camera with a light facing someone and I realise its Jeremy Kyle.

Kyle, best known for his daytime TV show, says he was not hurt in the incident but decided to 'vacate the area'

The 40-year-old bouncer said he would happily spray Kyle again because of the way he made Magaluf look bad when it was actually a nice place to live

'He's being mobbed, then suddenly everyone disperses and I see people running away towards me and in all directions crying and coughing and saying it was tear gas. Then when I clarified with Leon, he said it was pepper spray.' 

The incident was also witnessed by Scarlett Moffatt, star of TV show Gogglebox, who was visiting the resort.

She wrote in the Daily Star: 'It was clear to all that [Kyle] wasn't making a show to promote "Maga" and wanted to dish the dirt in the name of shock entertainment where his viewers can judge what they don't understand.

'It ended with Jezza being pepper-sprayed by the bouncer and the poor fella was as confused as one of his show guests getting a full-house on the lie detector machine.'

A spokesman for Jeremy Kyle last night played down the incident, claiming the TV presenter was not the main target of the pepper-spray. 

The spokesman said: 'Jeremy was walking around the strip with his film crew on Friday night when someone in the busy crowd sprayed the spray above their heads.

'They decided to vacate the area to be on the safe side, as the spray was starting to have an affect on the eyes.

'Jeremy wasn't trying to get into the nightclub and wasn't refused entry by a bouncer.

'He is filming in Magaluf for an upcoming series which is expected to run next year and one episode will focus on the youth culture in the area.'

The resort's reputation has sunk even lower this summer, after video footage emerged of a girl performing sex acts on 24 men for a free drink.

It is believed the Northern Irish teen had been told she would win a 'free holiday' for the performance, but a 'holiday' turned out to be the name of a cocktail at the bar.

The head of Carnage Events Magalluf, who organised the bar crawl on which the incident happened, then caused outrage by blaming the girl.

Paul Smith insisted he bore no 'moral responsibility' for the girl's actions, adding: 'She should be spoken to by her parents. It's something to do with her upbringing.'

The bar crawls also hosted Benefits Street star White Dee, who was seen downing beer and shots 

Earlier this year, Benefits Street star White Dee was photographed hosting the bar crawl while still claiming she was 'too depressed to work'.

The 42-year-old mother-of-two, who rose to fame on the Channel 4 documentary examining the lives of the unemployed, was pictured kissing a young man and clutching bottles of champagne.

She later denied she had been drinking and said taking part in the events was part of her rehabilitation back into work.

But the photos caused anger back in Britain, with one MP branding Dee a 'poster girl' for people who think they can become 'famous for doing nothing'.

The pub crawl scandal has led two other reality TV stars, James 'Arg' Argent and Dan Osborne from The Only Way is Essex, to pull out of hosting the event.

A spokesman for the pair said today: 'Arg and Dan Osborne won't be going to the pool parties because they started filming a couple of weeks late and are behind schedule.

'Whether they take part in the pool parties in future is something we will look at, but they definitely won't be going on the pub crawl, which is what the public has a problem with.

'They were only ever booked to go to the pool party and we are now considering whether to reschedule that.'
