Jeida Torres, 3, died in Brooklyn after she was allegedly beaten by her mother's boyfriend

A 3-year-old girl in New York City died Saturday after her mother's boyfriend allegedly beat her to death in a fit of rage when she accidentally soiled herself.

Cops found little Jeida Torres unconscious and unresponsive about 3:50pm Saturday in an apartment in Brooklyn's Bushwick neighborhood. Police had been called by a neighbor who heard the child screaming inside the place.

'I saw the paramedics run out with little girl wrapped in a blanket,' neighbor Keith Best, 43, told the New York Daily News. 

'Her hands were just hanging out — just limp.'

Jeida had been allegedly 'punched and choked' by 20-year-old Kelsey Smith, who was babysitting her and her 5-year-old brother Andrew, sources told the Daily News.

'She either pooped her pants or peed on herself, and he got agitated,' the source told the newspaper.

The 3-year-old girl was rushed to Wyckoff Hospital in cardiac arrest with trauma to her head and tiny body — but didn't survive.

Her 5-year-old brother Andrew was left covered in bruises from his injuries, according to the Daily News. He was in stable condition Saturday night.

Smith, who has a criminal record, tried to commit suicide by cutting himself but failed, the newspaper reported.

He fled the scene of the alleged beating but was arrested in Queens after someone tipped police off, according to the Daily News.

He remained in custody late Saturday night but has not been charged with a crime.

The mother, Kimberly Torres, had left them with Smith while she went to work. She arrived a half-hour after paramedics were called.

Neighbors say the couple had been fighting violently for two weeks.

One of them, Marilyn Cruz, told the Daily News she'd called police about the fights but got no response.

Torres and her father sobbed uncontrollably en route to the hospital.

'He was crying — he just lost his mind,' neighbor Keith Best told the Daily News.

The Bushwick building where the tragedy unfolded, 38 Cooper St., is a 16-unit transitional homeless shelter managed by the nonprofit Housing Bridge, records show.

The mother arrived at the scene 30 minutes after 3-year-old Jeida was rushed to the hospital
