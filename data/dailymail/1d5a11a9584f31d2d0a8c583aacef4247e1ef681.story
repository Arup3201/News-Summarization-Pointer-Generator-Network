Assassinated: 32-year-old Ali Armagan was shot at six times while he was parked outside at tube station. No one has been convicted of his murder

Three men who helped set up the murder of their rival gang's leader in a revenge attack were jailed today.

32-year-old Ali Armagan, who led a North London Turkish gang was shot outside a tube station by members of the 'Tottenham Boys'.

Minicab driver Suleyman Tonbul, 54, his 26-year-old 
son Hasan and Mehmet Senel, 24, tipped off their gang's leader after seeing Mr Armagan in his car.

Half an hour later, Mr Armagan was shot dead.

The underworld drug boss' assassination was the third in a series of five murders linked to the bloody feud between the Bombacilar, or Hackney Turks, and the Tottenham Boys, or Tottenham Turks.

Senel and the Tonbuls were
charged with conspiracy to cause grievous bodily harm on the basis 
that they expected Ali Armagan to be beaten up but not shot.

26-year-old Hassan
Tonbul was on parole at the time of the killing in February 2012. He had served an 18 month sentence for attacking a cafe owner in Tottenham
with a meat cleaver.

He was also under an ASBO banning him from contacting members of the Tottenham Turks.

His father, who spotted Ali Armagan while driving his minicab is said to be a well-respected member of the Turkish community and has no previous convictions.

Judge Anthony Morris QC sentenced Suleyman Tonbul to eight years, Hassan Tonbul to 11 years and Senel to ten years at the Old Bailey.

Prosecutor William Emlyn Jones told the 
Old Bailey: 'The killing took 
place against the background of a long running feud between two Turkish 
drug gangs operating in north London.

'On
any view this was a particularly bloodthirsty feud.

'It is wholly 
unacceptable that the streets of our city have become a battleground 
between these two gangs with the risk of innocent members of the public 
being injured or killed.'

Suleyman Tonbul spotted Mr Armagan's distinctive Audi while driving in the Tottenham area. He made three phone calls to his son, who was with Mehmet Senel.

The men are said to have passed the message on to Kemel Eren and his right hand man Omar Murat, who are believed to have gone straight to the scene in Turnpike 
Lane.

Six shots were fired at Mr Armagan's car.

Old Bailey: The three men were jailed for conspiracy to cause grievous bodily harm because they thought Ali Armagan would be beaten up when they told gang members about his whereabouts

Only six weeks ago one of the leading members of the Tottenham Turks, Zafer Eren, was shot dead in Southgate, north London.

There have also been nearly 30 other incidents involving attempted murder, beatings, arson attacks and threats of violence.

Nobody
has been convicted of the murder of Ali Armagan but the court heard the
two gunmen are believed to be Kemel Eren, the head of the Tottenham 
Turks, and his right hand man Omar Murat.

After
the killing Kemel Eren - nicknamed 'No Fingers' - fled to Turkey and 
was himself shot in December last year and left wheelchair bound.

The background to the murder of Ali Armagan can be traced back a brawl at a the Manor Club in Finsbury Park, north London, on 24 January 2009.

Kemal Armagan, Ali's Brother, was injured in the fight and vowed to kill anyone who attacked him, including Mehmet Senpalit, a Tottenham Turk.
