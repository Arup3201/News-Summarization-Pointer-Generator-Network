A man giving doctors a demonstration on how 3D printers can assist surgery collapsed with a kidney stone - then made a model of his own organ to help his operation.

John Cousins, who owns a 3D printing services company, was giving a talk on the medical uses of the technology at Bournemouth Hospital.

But during the demonstration in October last year he passed out in agony and was rushed to the facility's own A&E department for scans.

After doctors removed his appendix that afternoon, they said Mr Cousins would need a further operation to extract a kidney stone.

John Cousins used his firm's 3D printing software to make a model of his own kidney before having surgery to remove a stone from it. The model cut the operation time significantly and helped guide surgeons 

Scans revealed the stone was big - 3.5cm - and shaped like a stag's head (left picture, left of centre). Mr Cousins was able to work from images taken by surgeons to make the model

Scans revealed the stone was big - 3.5cm - and shaped like a stag's head.

While waiting for the second operation, which was conducted on Monday, Mr Cousins used his  3D printer technology to make a model of his kidney.

He said: 'While I was lying in the hospital bed I thought "hang on, we could utilise the technology".

'I talked it all through with the surgeon and we decided we would try and create a model of my kidney.'

And surgeons at Southampton General Hospital did end up using the fake organ as a guide during the op.

Medics say having the plastic kidney slashed an hour from his two-hour kidney stone removal operation on Monday.

Mr Cousins, 46, of Southampton, Hampshire, said: 'While giving the demonstration, I collapsed on the floor in excruciating pain. They took me to the A&E and found I had appendicitis and a kidney stone.

'They operated to remove the appendix that afternoon and as I was recovering and talking to the consultant I thought, hang on, we could utilise the 3D technology here.'

He printed a model of his own kidney containing the inch-long stone, which was caused by a build-up of blood waste products in his kidney.

Mr Cousins was able to work from images taken by surgeons  - such as X-rays and MRI scans - to make the model in just over four hours.  

Mr Cousins used his printer  to produce a multi-coloured plaster of Paris kidney that can be opened up to reveal the stone inside. Southampton General Hospital has agreed to trial the process with 21 other patients to monitor the usefulness of the technology

Mr Cousins printed a model of his own kidney, complete with the inch-long kidney stone it contained.

To create an object from a 3D printer you can either create a design of it on an computer with 3D software or a scan of the object.

The printer will then create the different layers and connect them together to create a 3D object.

Mr Cousins was able to work from images taken by surgeons to make the model, such as X-rays and MRI scans.

He used his printer - a ProJet 660 - to produce a multi-coloured plaster of Paris kidney that can be opened up to reveal the stone inside.

This took just over four hours. 

While 2D images are currently used to to plan the operations, surgeons believe up to an hour can be cut off procedure times by using 3D models to give medics more detailed briefings on the operation ahead.

Time can also be saved on explaining the procedure to patients and hopefully increase their approval of the operations.

Father-of-two Mr Cousins said: 'We hope it can save a lot of money too. The models cost £123 to produce but the savings in surgery time could be in the thousands.'

Surgeon Bhaskar Somani believes the technology could be a cost-effective way to speed up operations.

He said: 'It makes our job easier going in. 

'This was a large stone, almost 3.5cm, so it's quite a big bulk. 

'The 3D model helps because it gives us a rough estimation of where to come from and to be more precise.'

The process has featured in America and surgeons at a New York hospital created a 3D heart that saved the life of a two-week-old baby.
