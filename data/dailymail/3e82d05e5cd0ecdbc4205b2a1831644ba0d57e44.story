Fabian Delph has admitted he will vote for England's man of the moment Harry Kane has his PFA Player of the Year.

Kane can do no wrong and scored with a header just minutes after coming on as substitute against Lithuania on Friday evening at Wembley.

Delph, with the England squad preparing for Tuesday's friendly in Turin against Italy, said: 'He will get my vote. There are a few contenders but I will pick wisely and I cannot see why I won’t pick Harry.

'He is a really hard worker. He has time to progress but he will keep his feet to the ground.'

Defender Chris Smalling admitted Kane would be on his shortlist too.

'I don't want to say my vote just yet, but he'll definitely be in the running,' the Manchester United man said.

The 21-year-old striker has scored 19 Premier League goals for Tottenham so far this season

Delph and Smalling also said they hoped Roy Hodgson, whose long-term future has been the subject of much speculation, would continue as England boss after Euro 2016.

'Of course,' Delph said. 'He's been great for me, he's brought me into the squad and he's got a good relationship with the boys.'

Smalling added: 'Ever since I've worked with Roy he's been one that's shown a lot of faith in all the players, especially the young players. We've all enjoyed our training with him.'

The win over Lithuania continued England's 100 per cent start to the qualifying campaign and Smalling said the goal was to win every match in Group E.

'That would be the ultimate goal and the manager has stressed that in our meetings,' he said. 'He sets very high standards and we need to make sure we stick by them, but so far so good.'

Smalling's club contract expires at the end of next season and the 25-year-old has been linked with a summer move away from Old Trafford.

Asked about the speculation over his future, he said: 'That's one I've not even really discussed with anyone. It's a case of the manager's showing his faith in me, I'm playing, I'm happy.

'I'm enjoying it, I've always enjoyed playing for United, especially at the minute. If I can contribute as we are now then I'm happy to stay for as long as they want me.'

Asked if there were any contract negotiations under way, Smalling added: 'Not that I'm aware of, I don't really take care of that.'
