An engineer raised concerns about a faulty ejector seat parachute mechanism two decades before a Red Arrow pilot was killed when his ejector seat parachute didn't deploy properly, an inquest has heard.

Sean Cunningham, an experienced pilot and Iraq war veteran, was killed when his ejector seat's stabilising parachute did not deploy, which meant that his main parachute also failed, leaving him to fall to 300ft to the ground.

The inquest heard the over-tightening of crucial nuts and bolts when fitting the ejector seat mechanism could have caused the ejector seat parachute to fail.

Flight Lieutenant Sean Cunningham was 
killed on November 8, 2011, when he was ejected from his Hawk T1 
aircraft while on the ground at RAF Scampton in Lincolnshire, where he 
was projected around 300ft in the air.

His parachute didn't deploy properly, and as a result, he crashed to the ground, later dying in hospital from multiple injuries.

The inquest heard today from Neil Mackie, a reliability support engineer in the quality assurance department at Martin Baker, the manufacturers of the ejector seat in Cunningham's plane.

Mr Mackie said he received a fax in 1991 from British Aerospace (BA) saying they should tighten the nuts and bolts, and he replied by saying they should do no such thing.

He said: 'I thought "What a silly thing to do".'

When Mackie told Richard Seabrook, counsel to coroner Stuart Fisher, he thought the instruction from BA to tighten the bolts was incorrect at the time.

He said: 'Yes, I would not be happy with that.'

He said he was sure he would have communicated to BA that the nuts and bolts should not be over tightened, and raised the matter internally with Martin Baker.

The inquest also heard from Michael Cameron, who was chief technical instructor at Martin Baker between 1999 and 2008, who told the inquest the ejector seat was distributed to 17 countries around the world.

Tom Kark QC, representing the pilot's family, asked: 'Did Martin Baker know about this problem 20 years ago.'

Mr Cameron said: 'From documents I've seen, yes, Martin Baker did.'

Cameron was also questioned by Bernard Thorogood, representing Health and Safety Executive, who said: 'This should have been passed on to customers in an urgent manner? The risk that you identified was risk to life?'

Mr Cameron replied: 'Yes. But I don't know what happened at that time.'

The inquest continues.
