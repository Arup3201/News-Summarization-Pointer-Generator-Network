Clint Eastwood showed off his new girlfriend Christina Sandera on the red carpet at the Academy Awards, and now her ex-husband is opening up about their past together - and her criminal history.

Paul Wainscoat, who was married to Sandera for 11 months before filing for divorce, says her 'drinking' led to frequent fights between the pair, and a few that even turned physical.

In fact, prior to their marriage, police were called to the house and she was arrested for domestic battery after an incident between her and Wainscoat.

Ex-husband Paul Wainscoat,  claims that on July 17, 2002,  she became enraged when he refused to move in with her, and when he tried to leave 'grabbed onto his shirt and scratched his neck to prevent him. He called police, arrested her for domestic battery

Wainscoat tells The National Enquirer that on July 17, 2002, just two months after he began dating Sandera, she became enraged when he refused to move in with her, and when he tried to leave 'grabbed onto his shirt and scratched his neck to prevent him.'

He managed to call the police, who in their report, noted a 'strong odor' of alcohol on Sandera's breath as they arrested her for domestic battery.

The couple still married eight months later though, after, according to Wainscoat, he spent $80,000  on the couple's honeymoon and jewelry and 'dental work' for his bride.

A few months after they married another physical fight broke out between the pair, with Wainscoat claiming that this time Sandera went into a rage as she was 'distraught due to the recent death of one of her cats.'

He claims she began screaming at him 'Where are my kittens?' and then began hitting him with a closed fist before throwing 'a full bottle of Gatorade, which hit him in the back of the head.'

He says he did not file charges on account of her 'drinking.'

Wainscoat also describes other instances of 'bizarre behavior,' including a time that Sandera threatened to 'axe' their furniture if he left her.

The marriage finally blew up in June 2003, when police responded to another domestic disturbance with Wainscoat claiming he was 'being battered by his wife.'

In court papers Sandera said she was not an alcoholic but had quit booze and attended AA meetings.

This could possibly explain why Margot Robbie claims Eastwood gave her a glare when she popped a bottle of champagne in front of the two during the Academy Awards ceremony.

In addition, Sandera said she attended '15 anger management classes.'

'It was hell,' says Wainscoat of the relationship.

'I wish Clint all the luck in the world with that woman.'

Sandera, 51, and Eastwood, 84, have been dating since last summer after the two met while she was working as a restaurant hostess at Eastwood's Mission Ranch Hotel.

She now lives in the $20million mansion Eastwood had built for his ex-wife Dina before their split in 2013 after 17 years of marriage.
