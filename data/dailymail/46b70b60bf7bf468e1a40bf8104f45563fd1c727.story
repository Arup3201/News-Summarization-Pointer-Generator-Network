Liquor baron-turned-business tycoon Gurdeep Singh Chadha, popularly known as Ponty Chadha, was shot dead by his brother yesterday in an bitter property dispute that also ended with the death of the brother and a security guard.

Ponty's younger brother, Hardeep Singh Chadha, was killed in retaliatory firing by a security guard accompanying the elder brother.

The dispute between the brothers started when their father, Kulwant Singh Chadha, died last year without dividing the property among his three sons - Gurdeep, Hardeep and Rajinder.

The dispute ended in a bloodbath with security guards of both brothers exchanging 40 rounds in the grounds of the Chadha farmhouse at Chhatarpur in New Delhi

According to sources, Ponty had approached the Delhi Police a few days ago requesting security cover as he anticipated a threat to his life from Hardeep.

The shootout took place between 11.45 am and 12.30 pm at Chadha's DLF farmhouse-42 in Chhatarpur, where armed men from both the sides fired around 40 rounds at each other.

By the time the police reached the spot, Ponty had already been shifted to Fortis hospital in Vasant Kunj, where he succumbed to his injuries, while Hardeep, also known as Satnam, was lying in a pool of blood on the floor.

Narender Kumar, a security guard with Ponty, was also injured in the firing and later succumbed to his injuries in a hospital in Gurgaon.

In the morning, Ponty along with his security personnel allegedly barged into the farmhouse and locked up all the rooms on the premises. The ownership of the farmhouse - a sprawling 7-acre property - was a bone of contention among the three brothers.

They were supposed to meet and amicably settle the dispute over all their properties at the farmhouse on Saturday.

The staff at the farmhouse informed Hardeep, who was at the nearby Chadha property â€“ 21 Oak Drive - about the arrival of Ponty along with his guards.

He immediately reached the farmhouse along with his security guards and entered into an argument with Ponty.

The argument turned ugly when, according to eyewitnesses, Ponty pushed Hardeep, who took out his pistol and pumped bullets into his elder brother's chest.

This triggered a retaliatory fire from Sachin Tyagi, a police security officer accompanying Ponty.

Constable Tyagi fired three bullets of which one hit Hardeep who was being escorted by Punjab police personnel.

Hardeep tried to escape from the back gate but collapsed inside the house.

Constable Tyagi somehow managed to drag injured Ponty out of the house, put him into a Land Cruiser and drive to Fortis Hospital in Vasant Kunj.

Ponty's body was later shifted to AIIMS mortuary. Hardeep's body was also taken to AIIMS for postmortem and other legal formalities.

Hardeep's lawyer Gaurang Kanth said he received a call from him around 12.20 pm, telling him that he anticipated "loss of control of all the properties" as he was about to meet his brother to settle the dispute.

Hardeep asked Kanth to take legal "proactive" measures to secure his properties and business interests.

Kanth described the killings as 'unanticipated' and 'shocking'. He said that a 'reasonable settlement' was being worked out for the past six to seven months and a breakthrough was expected soon.

According to Kanth, Hardeep wanted to settle the dispute, collect his share and start his own venture.

Ponty Chadha hit the headlines earlier this year when the I-T department conducted raids at 13 of his properties in Delhi - Sainik Farms, Lajpat Nagar, New Friends Colony - and six locations in Noida, Moradabad and Lucknow.

The raids, however, proved to be a damp squib as Chadha with his political influence in Uttar Pradesh managed to get information beforehand.

Sources claimed that Chadha had emptied the vault raided by the I-T officials and left a silver coin there to show off his connections with politicians and senior bureaucrats of the state.

"We have registered a case and are investigating the matter," said Vivek Gogia, special commissioner, southern range.

He was known as the man who knew how to handle politicians. Ponty Chadha did not just hobnob with political heavyweights in Punjab, Uttarakhand and Uttar Pradesh, but was so deft at connecting with power that even if the state governments changed, he could turn the tide in his favour.

It was this ability to pull the right strings in the political circle that helped him become a business tycoon in a short span of time.

During Amarinder Singh's rule in Punjab about eight years ago, Chadha managed to gain control of the lucrative liquor business through "stage-managed" auctions.

After the political scene changed in the state, his real estate business suffered hurdles - but not for long.

With his sharp business acumen, Chadha expanded his liquor business in not just Punjab, but also Rajasthan, Delhi, UP, Uttarakhand and Chhattisgarh.

The liquor baron's political links became clear during the wedding of his daughter in February this year.

Politicians cutting across party lines attended the function. Punjab's deputy CM Sukhbir Singh Badal, former CM Amarinder and former Haryana CM Om Prakash Chautala attended the event.

So did Samajwadi Party (SP) leader Ram Gopal Yadav, former BSP MP Akbar Ahmad and Delhi's education and tourism minister Arvinder Singh Lovely.

According to sources,Chadha enjoyed close links with BSP chief Mayawati and started ruling the liquor trade in the state ever since she came to power in UP.

SP spokesman Rajendra Chowdhry alleged: "Chadha benefited the most under Mayawati's rule. Her policy (of awarding liquor licences) was tailormade for him."

In 2010, Chadha bagged five of 11 sick sugar mills sold by the UP government.

"He got the mills for Rs 276 crore, when their market price was Rs 1,000-1,500 crore," alleged Rita Bahuguna Joshi of the Congress.

It was, however, under Mayawati's predecessor SP supremo Mulayam Singh Yadav's rule that Chadha's business had taken a big leap.

Mulayam had inaugurated his Wave mall-cummultiplex in Lucknow and given Chadha several concessions in the project.

The liquor baron was written off by people when Mayawati lost the CM's chair in March this year.

But then he appeared at the swearing-in ceremony of current UP CM Akhilesh Yadav the same month. In Uttarakhand, Chadha's links with state leaders came to light in 2010, when he grabbed over half-adozen hydropower projects.

Chadha's Chandigarh-based companies bagged the projects despite state government guidelines saying local firms had to be given preference.

The allotments were later cancelled after two PILs were filed in the Nainital High Court. Chadha is also alleged to have operated liquor shops in the state.
