Celtic manager Ronny Deila felt his side could have hit 10 goals as they swept aside St Mirren with a 4-1 victory at Parkhead.

Deila's side moved six points clear in the Scottish Premiership after Scott Brown's early double helped put them 3-1 up inside 18 minutes.

Celtic looked like running up a huge score as they went on to dominate after St Mirren's decent start but the hosts only hit the net once more, through Anthony Stokes.

Stefan Johansen, John Guidetti and Nir Bitton and Stokes all came close and Stefan Scepovic missed a hat-trick of sitters after replacing the injured Swedish striker.

Deila said: 'We are creating chances and that is positive. Also some of the attacks are the way I want to attack, with opposite movements and three players involved.

'There were some good attacks and we are playing more forward now as well. There is also a quick reaction to winning the ball back.

'There were a lot of pleasing things but again I was thinking 'is this enough? Should we be scoring more goals?'

'That's something we have to work on if we are going to improve - we need to be more clinical.

'It's hard sitting here and being critical when your're winning 4-1 and could have scored 10, but again that shows the potential in the team.'

James Forrest, who scored Celtic's second goal, went off at half-time with a migraine while Guidetti limped off early in the second half.

Deila said of the Swede: 'They have checked him and said they think it's just a kick but you never know so we will have to see. It was a tackle and if it was a twist or a hard tackle, I don't know.'

Deila now turns his attention to the Europa League draw on Monday and he would prefer to avoid a rematch with Legia Warsaw, who knocked his side out of the Champions League qualifiers before a registration error saw the result reversed.

'They are a good team of course,' Deila said. 'They have won almost all their games.

'It will be a special game if that's the draw. Hopefully we get something else. The players will be up for the game whatever comes and if that's going to be Legia Warsaw, I don't think there's any problem.'

Meanwhile, St Mirren caretaker manager Gary Teale saw enough attacking intent from his team to give him confidence ahead of Saturday's clash with fellow strugglers Motherwell.

Sean Kelly equalised in the 10th minute but Kenny McLean should have opened the scoring in the first minute.

Teale, who stepped in when Tommy Craig left in midweek, said: 'I take a lot of positives because of the chances we created.

'But the goals we concede are far too easy and I need to change the mentality on that because it can't continue.

'Celtic are always going to create chances but if we come here and create chances, then we know the confidence is going to come back.'

Teale has thrown his hat into the ring for the job on a permanent basis.

'It's something I'm confident I can do, and even if offered the job here I would be over the moon to accept,' he said.

'But that's not a decision for me. The whole experience has been a bit of a whirlwind and I have probably not slept.

'I'm sitting here is if I will be in charge next weekend, but that can obviously change.'
