England’s dramatic World Cup match with Uruguay was the most-watched TV programme of the year - although many viewers will wish they hadn’t bothered after our boys lost 2-1.

Some 13.9million people watched the game on ITV1 in June, and it was followed by BBC1 shows The Great British Bake Off in October with 13.5million, and Sherlock in January with 12.7million.

Also scoring highly for broadcasters were Britain’s Got Talent for ITV1 in April with 12.4million, and Germany’s 1-0 win against Argentina in the World Cup final in July on BBC1 with 12.1million.

Fictional detective: Sherlock on BBC1 in January came third on the list with 12.7million viewers. It was revealed in the episode how the character, played by Benedict Cumberbatch, faked his death

England crashed out of the World Cup in Brazil one day after their defeat to Uruguay, whose two goals came from Luis Suarez, including an 85th-minute winner after Wayne Rooney had equalised.

It was the first time England had been knocked out in the group stages since 1958, with their elimination confirmed a day after the Uruguay defeat, when Costa Rica beat Italy in another game.

The figures on most-watched TV programmes came as it was revealed ITV viewing figures slumped more than any other channel this year as audiences deserted big hitting shows like The X Factor.

A disastrous 2014 saw 8 per cent of its peak time viewers leave the channel, with it faring even worse two years ago when it had the excuse of the BBC’s London 2012 Olympics coverage.

Hit talent show: Britain's Got Talent on ITV1 in April was fourth in the 2014 ratings list with 12.4million viewers

Victory: Germany’s 1-0 win against Argentina in the World Cup final in July on BBC1 had 12.1million viewers

In the jungle: I'm A Celebrity Get Me Out Of Here brought in 11.9million viewers for ITV1 last month

This year’s nosedive comes despite traditional ratings winners such as the World Cup, Coronation Street and I’m A Celebrity Get Me Out Of Here.

Figures from trade body the Broadcasters' Audience Research Board (Barb) for the journal Broadcast showed ITV was the big loser in audience ratings for the year to December 7.

BBC1 and Channel 5 remained stable, while BBC2 and Channel 4 both recorded falls. ITV’s average audience across all hours was just 1.4million viewers, a 15.7 per cent share of the available audience.

This is down 8 per cent on the 1.51million viewers - representing a 16.3 per cent share - in 2013 when it seemed to have recovered from the damage done by BBC coverage of the 2012 Olympics.

This year’s X Factor audience averaged 8.5million and a 33.2 per cent share, compared to 9.2million and a 34.8 per cent share last year when Sam Bailey won.

However, an ITV spokesman defended the channel’s performance, telling Broadcast: ‘In 2014 ITV broadcast 99.3 per cent of commercial programmes that attracted audiences over five million viewers.

‘We also had the most watched new drama series in Cilla, the most watched soap in Coronation Street, the most watched entertainment series in Britain’s Got Talent, and the highest rating comedy in Birds of a Feather.’

BBC1 controller Charlotte Moore said: ‘Whoever would have thought a show about baking would be the highest rating show of the year outside of the World Cup?’
