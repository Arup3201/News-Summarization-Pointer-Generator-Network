Disgraced TV chef Paula Deen's marriage is reportedly on the rocks after she confronted her husband of nine years about his alleged cheating.

According to the National Enquirer, the 66-year-old Southern cooking queen questioned tugboat captain Michael Groover, 57, whom she met 11 years ago and lives with in Savannah, Georgia, after a friend told her he had a secret mistress.

A source quoted in the report claims Deen 'went on the warpath' when she heard about the alleged affair and though he adamantly denied it, the rumors 'pushed their marriage to breaking point.'

Alleged affair: According to the National Enquirer, the 66-year-old Southern cooking queen, left, questioned tugboat captain Michael Groover, 57, right, whom she met 11 years ago, after a friend told her he had a secret mistress

'She had an explosive argument with Michael that ended with him storming out of the house,' the source said.

According to the Enquirer, the mistress is a 'sexy middle-age brunette' who lives nearby and has known Groover and his family for years.

The woman allegedly entertained her lover once a week for more than a year at her Wilmington Island home, and on occasion they went out for drinks.

'It was no secret they were having an affair,' the source reportedly told the Enquirer.

'It went on for more than a year and the only surprise is that it took Paula so long to find out about it.'

But when she did find out, she confronted her husband immediately, the Enquirer reports.

'He denied cheating, but she wasn't satisfied he was telling the truth and needled him relentlessly. Finally, Michael got fed up and took off in a huff,' the source claimed.

After both of them calmed down, Groover allegedly returned home, and swore his innocence and allegiance to Deen.

But the source told the magazine, 'she still isn't convinced he's being completely honest.'
