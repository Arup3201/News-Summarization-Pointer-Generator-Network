Barcelona are chasing as many as six new faces this summer in an attempt to claw back the La Liga title.

Reports in Spain claim that new manager Luis Enrique is keeping tabs on Atletico Madrid's Koke and Marquinhos from Paris Saint-Germain.

The pair are two of the hottest properties in Europe at the moment, and Barca are on the hunt for quality as they look to re-mould their squad.

Gerardo Martino's solitary season in charge ended without silverware, and Mundo Deportivo say Valencia's Jeremy Mathieu and Real Sociedad goalkeeper Claudio Bravo are on the radar.

Cuadrado is a nippy wide man and has been reported to have interested Brendan Rodgers and Liverpool already this summer.
