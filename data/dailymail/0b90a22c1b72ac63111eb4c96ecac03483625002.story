The Florida man convicted in November of 
second-degree murder for the 2007 slaying of Washington Redskins 
star Sean Taylor has been sentenced to 57 years in prison.

Eric Rivera Jr., 23, was sentenced Thursday after he was convicted in November of second-degree murder and armed burglary. Rivera had faced a maximum life sentence.

Despite Florida having the death penalty, Rivera never faced it because he was only 17-years-old at the time of the killing - but he is required to serve 85 per cent of his sentence.

Botched robbery: Eric Rivera Jr, shown last year during his trial, was sentenced to 57 years in prison for  the slaying of Redskins star Sean Taylor

Locked up: Rivera sat quietly at the defense table with his lawyers last year as the verdict was announced, showing no reaction or emotion

The 57 year sentence handed down Monday allows Rivera to avoid life in prison, but he will not be eligible for parole until he is 72-years-old.

Rivera told police in a videotaped 
confession that he and other young men from the Fort Myers area broke 
into Taylor's Miami-area house hoping to steal cash the NFL player kept 
there.

Taylor surprised them because he was home instead of on a road trip with the Redskins, and was shot after confronting them with a machete.

Rivera admitted shooting the star player, but said on the witness stand during his trial that his confession was given 
only under police pressure and amid purported threats to his family.

The sentence comes two months after he sat quietly at the defense table 
with his lawyers after the verdict was announced, showing no reaction or
 emotion.

The courtroom was packed with Taylor and Rivera family 
members, but there were no outbursts when the verdict was read.

Neither prosecutors, Taylor's family nor the family of the football player's girlfriend would comment after the hearing.

In the confession, Rivera said the group
 of five young men, all from the Fort Myers area, had driven to Taylor's
 house planning to steal large amounts of cash he kept inside.

Victim: Taylor is shown during the team's 2007 preseason summer training camp

They 
thought Taylor, 24, would be out of town at a game against Tampa Bay, 
but didn't realize until it was too late that he was home with a knee 
injury.

Taylor's then-girlfriend, Jackie Garcia Haley, and their 
18-month-old daughter, were also home at the time. They were not hurt.

Four other men were also charged in the 
case and three will be tried later. Venjah Hunte, 25, pleaded guilty to 
second-degree murder and burglary charges in a deal that calls for a 
29-year prison sentence.

Rivera 
claimed while testifying in his own defense that it was Hunte who brought the 9mm handgun and shot Taylor.

Rivera insisted that he was not told about the burglary plot until the 
group was driving across Alligator Alley toward Miami, and that he 
stayed in the car outside Taylor's house the whole time.

The murder weapon was never found. Police say it was stuffed in a sock and thrown into the Everglades.

Taylor, a Pro Bowl safety who had 
starred at the University of Miami, was shot in the upper thigh, 
damaging his femoral artery and causing massive blood loss.

Admission: Rivera, shown last October during his trial, was 17-years-old at the time of the killing - sparing him from the death penalty

Witnesses 
say Taylor was shot when he confronted the group with a machete outside 
his bedroom. A medical examiner said he was essentially dead on arrival 
at a hospital on November 26, 2007, although doctors did manage to restart 
his heart for a while.

Aside from Rivera's confession, police 
found shoe prints outside Taylor's home that matched sneakers some in 
the group were wearing that night.

Witnesses testified Rivera was seen 
driving a rented black Toyota Highlander believed used in the crime, and
 another witness said the group of five had burglary tools when they 
came to her house after Taylor was shot.

Taylor, a first-round Redskins draft 
pick in 2004, signed an $18 million contract with the team and was 
becoming one of the NFL's top defensive players when he was slain.

Several witnesses, including Garcia Haley, testified that he liked to 
keep large amounts of cash around his Miami house.

One of the men charged in the slaying, 
25-year-old Jason Mitchell, attended a birthday party a few weeks 
earlier at the house for Taylor's half-sister, Sasha Johnson â€” who lived
 in Fort Myers and knew Rivera.

She testified that Taylor gave her a 
purse containing $10,000 in cash at the party, which was witnessed by 
all the guests.

That event put the wheels in motion for 
the burglary plot, witnesses said. Rivera himself testified that some in
 the group thought they would get between $100,000 and $200,000 to split
 up.

Also charged and awaiting trial are Mitchell, Charles Wardlow, 24, and 22-year-old Timothy Brown.

Jackie
 Garcia, Taylor's girlfriend, who was also inside the bedroom, became 
noticeably upset as the detective recounted details of the slaying and 
rested her head on her knees in court.

She sat near several members of 
Taylor's family, including his father, Florida City Police Chief Pedro 
Taylor, in the packed Miami-Dade County courtroom.
