Dungarees are, according to the fashion pages, back in fashion. Not only have style icons such as Alexa Chung and Heidi Klum been spotted out and about in them, but they’ve also been all over the catwalks.

And while it might not be a surprise to see them championed by designers who target the youth market, such as House of Holland and Moschino Cheap & Chic, grown-up labels, including Stella McCartney and Margaret Howell, have come up with their versions, too.

Their chic designs prompted me to wonder if I, a grandmother in her early 70s, could carry off such a look. The last time I stepped out in dungarees was in the late Eighties. Made from thick, brushed cotton with a fake fur trim, they were bottle green and even had a matching jacket.

Back in fashion: Trendsetters Alexa Chung, left and Keira Knightley have been pictured in dungarees recently but could grandmother Sandra Howard pull them off? Scroll down to find out...

I’d picked them up at a British Designer Sale and though I can’t recall how much I paid for them, I clearly remember wearing them around Folkestone, my husband Michael Howard’s then constituency.

Some people say you should never wear a trend if you can remember its previous incarnation, but I’ve always had a soft spot for dungarees, so I was delighted to try the new versions. Here’s how they shaped up...

When I saw these on the hanger, they had instant appeal. They really stood out against some of the other more subdued designs.

And there’s no doubt that they would look incredibly cute on someone younger - and not just my toddling grandchildren.

But sadly, I felt like an old sheep in them.

Dungarees have always had slightly child-like connotations - maybe it’s because we dress babies in them or that they used to be almost uniform for children’s TV presenters - either way, these felt as if they lived down to that stereotype.

I’ve usually got no problem wearing clothes designed for any age.

In the past, I’ve swapped clothes with my daughter, Larissa, who’s in her 30s, so that’s not a problem for me.

I don’t think any of my children would be shocked to see me in what might be considered a young trend.

But these just looked a little bit off.

Teamed with a pair of brightly coloured heels, I felt like mutton dressed as lamb.

Keira Knightley looked great when she was pictured in denim dungarees, but I’m afraid these made me look as if I should be up a ladder with a paintbrush in my hand.

I did once own a pair like these, but they were strictly for gardening.

I felt self-conscious in these as the cut requires rather more up top than I possess.

Women with big busts might shy away from dungarees, but they’d be wrong.

For me, the heavier fabric made them less forgiving, they didn’t drape nicely and they added inches to my hips.

They made me feel like a farmhand and got me to wondering if the name dungarees had come about because this was the sort of thing you’d wear to shift dung.

Sadly, it’s a little more prosaic - garments like this were made from a coarse fabric from a region of Mumbai known as Dongri.

While this checked design was elegant, I thought they were perhaps too much for day and not enough for evening.

Maybe with some brighter accessories they might have made more of an impact, but these seemed to struggle to find their identity.

Though they wouldn’t be my first choice for gallivanting around town, this experiment has inspired me to give dungarees another go.

I think many women my age would shy away from them, perhaps thinking they wouldn’t be flattering or that they could look foolish.

But if you like trouser suits, you can wear dungarees.

Just pick the right pair, team them with a nice pair of heels and they won’t look remotely as if you’re a child or a decorator. Honestly!

What a revelation!

They looked like nothing on the hanger, but once on, I was impressed by how elegant they were.

These are so chic I could wear them to a glamorous evening function.

The silk fabric seemed to hang in a flattering way, and though I worried they might bulge in all the wrong places, in fact they’re kind to a pear shape.

Short sleeves made my arms feel exposed, so I’d probably wear a longer sleeved top, maybe in white for contrast.

These dungarees could take the place of a trouser suit.

I always think a little cross-dressing - such as a tuxedo - is rather fun and can look striking.

I didn't buy into onesies - they were reminiscent of those awful bodies we wore in the Nineties that you had to do up under your crotch.

Dungarees are more wear-able, but you have to pay a bit of attention when you go to the loo that the straps don’t disappear into the pan.

These spotty ones were easy to slip on and off, as you have to undo only one strap.

I can see these working as a lunch outfit or even as office wear.

Dungarees are far more forgiving than trousers.

My best feature is my waist and they defined that without hugging my bottom.

You don’t quite know what’s going on inside, so they do a good job of hiding things.

I don’t think that my husband Michael would object to them, though he might just think I was wearing trousers and a top.
