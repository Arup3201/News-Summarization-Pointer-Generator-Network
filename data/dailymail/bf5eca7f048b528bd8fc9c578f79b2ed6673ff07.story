Trainer Aidan O’Brien has acknowledged that he is likely to have Ryan Moore riding more of his horses this season.

Speculation has raged over the weekend about the likely riding plans for Ireland’s champion trainer with son and stable jockey Joseph having his first ride over hurdles at Limerick on Sunday when fifth on Egyptian Warrior.

Joseph has said that he will be back riding on the Flat on Wednesday at Dundalk but the constant battle with the scales for the jockey who is almost 6ft tall has seemingly never been tougher.

Three-time British champion Moore stepped in for three rides for Aidan O’Brien at the Curragh on Sunday, winning the maiden on The Warrior.

Moore’s reluctance to move to Ireland has always been an obstacle to a permanent role at Ballydoyle but O’Brien’s desire to secure his services more often is clear.

The trainer said: ‘We've a good relationship with Ryan and we always have. We used Ryan more last year than we did the year before and hopefully it will be that way again this year.’

Acknowledging his son’s weight issues, O’Brien added: ‘Obviously (doing) nine stone has been a problem for the last two seasons and last year it was a big problem.

‘This year he's heavier than he was this time last year. He'll go gently and we'll see what will happen. There's no doubt he'll come back down to the Flat gently and how far down he'll go, we'll wait and see.’

Joseph travelled from Limerick to the Curragh to ride in the annual gallops O’ Brien stages at the track and partnered 2,000 Guineas favourite.

The colt is just one of a clutch of Classic hopefuls he can potentially ride this season.

Meanwhile, OIiver Sherwood has said his Hennessy Gold Cup winner Many Clouds will run in the Grand National a week on Saturday.

The eight-year-old’s Aintree participation had been in doubt since his sixth to Coneygree in the Cheltenham Gold Cup.

Sherwood, successful with Puffin Billy at Ascot, said: ‘It is always a concern when (a race) is an after-thought but I still have it in the back of my mind that he did not run his race at Cheltenham

‘I don’t know if it was because we were put out of our comfort zone by the winner or just ran a bit flat. We won’t know and until we run next time.

Sherwood will be hoping to improve on a poor National record.

His four previous runners have not completed and both Sacred Path (1988) and Eric’s Charm (2010) fell at the first.

The Many Clouds news created a jockey shuffle. He will be ridden by Leighton Aspell, whose place on Dr Richard Newland-trained 2014 winner Pineau de Re is taken by Daryl Jacob.

Emma Lavelle, who had expected Jacob to ride her outsider Court By Surprise, is now searching for a replacement.

Paul Nicholls, who has six entries, has warned he needs to be convinced Sam Winner is over his Gold Cup exertions and the ground to be soft enough for Benvolio before they are confirmed in his team.
