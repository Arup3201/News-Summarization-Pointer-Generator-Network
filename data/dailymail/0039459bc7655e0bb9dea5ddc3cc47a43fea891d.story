Australia wrapped up a series whitewash over France with a comprehensive 39-13 victory in the third and final Test at the Allianz Stadium in Sydney.

Israel Folau scored two of Australia's five tries in the triumph, with debutant Will Skelton, Michael Hooper and Nick Phipps also crossing.

Fly-half Bernard Foley added the rest of the points with four conversions and two penalties giving him a personal haul of 14 points as the Wallabies made it seven Tests in a row for the first time since 1999-2000.

Sorry France could only respond with a solitary converted try from Guilhem Guirado in the second half plus a couple of penalties as they were convincing beaten - their 13th loss in 19 Tests and one that will increase the pressure on coach Philippe Saint-Andre.

That match was as good as over by half-time as Australia stormed into a 20-6 lead as they banished the memories of last weekend's scrappy 6-0 win in the second Test with an impressive showing.

Foley's third-minute penalty set the hosts on their way and they were 10-0 ahead inside eight minutes thanks to newcomer Skelton.

The giant 22-year-old, who was drafted into starting line-up in place of former Wallabies captain James Horwill, showed his considerable power as he barged his way past the challenge of France flanker Fulgence Ouedraogo to crash over from 12 yards out.

France full-back Brice Dulin got his side off the mark with a penalty but Foley responded with another three-pointer of his own and then Australia took advantage of the yellow card shown to Rabah Slimani to further increase their lead.

Prop Slimani was sin-binned in the 27th minute for tackling without the ball and within a minute of his departure Australia claimed their second try, Folau stretching over in the corner after play had been quickly spread out to the right.

Foley added his second successful conversion to make it 20-3 and, although Maxime Machenaud hit back for France with a penalty just before half-time, the Wallabies were in total control at the break.

And that dominance continued in the second half with Ewen McKenzie's men further increasing their lead inside two minutes as Folau crossed for the second time in the match - and the 13th time in Tests - when he capitalised on good work from Skelton to storm through the heart of the France defence and touch down.

Flanker Hooper added a fourth Australia try on the hour mark after more quick handling and incisive running saw the Wallabies cut through the middle, with Foley adding the extras to make it 34-6.

France finally had something to smile about in the 65th minute when they pulled a try back through Guirado, who was powered over by a driving maul, but Australia had the last word when replacement Phipps notched his maiden Test try late on after catching Les Bleus cold with a quickly-taken tap penalty.
