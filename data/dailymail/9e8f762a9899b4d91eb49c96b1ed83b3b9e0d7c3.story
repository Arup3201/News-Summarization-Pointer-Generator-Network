Laura Robson took the opportunity to cool down in the Florida heat on Thursday while she dipped in an ice bath as the British tennis nears a return to action after more than a year off the court.

The 21-year-old has not played since the 2014 Australian Open more than 15 months ago after requiring surgery on an injured wrist.

But Robson, who has been training in Tampa in a bid to build up her fitness in time to take part in next month's French Open at Roland Garros.

The former British No 1 was pictured sitting in an ice bath after a practice session and shared the picture on social media.

'No issues with ice baths when it's this hot in Florida,' Robson wrote on Facebook.

The latest social media update comes days after Robson spent time relaxing at country music festival Tortuga.

Robson's last appearance came in the 2014 Australian Open first round where she lost in straight sets

The 21-year-old shared a photo on Instagram of her soaking up the sun with two friends and captioned the image 'Country music is the best music #tortuga.'

Robson, once ranked as high as 29 in the womens' game, withdrew from the qualifying event of last month's Miami Open before removing her name from the entry list to the WTA Tour event in Bogota later this month.
