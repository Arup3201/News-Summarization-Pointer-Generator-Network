A boy being rushed to hospital for a double organ transplant was prevented from boarding a Ryanair flight because they arrived at the airport too close to departure.

The boy and his parents had rushed to Gran Canaria's airport on March 7 after being informed by staff at Madrid's Hospital La Paz that a liver and kidney had unexpectedly become available.

But despite arriving for a 4.50pm flight about 3pm, they were told they could not board because of the proximity to departure.

According to Aviacion Digital, an airline industry website, the unnamed boy and his family were attempting to fly - at the hospital's insistence - on RyanAir flight RYR2012 to the capital on the Saturday afternoon, The Local reported.

A Ryanair spokesman told MailOnline: 'We have looked into this matter with our handling agent at Las Palmas and unfortunately, we were unable to accommodate this family onto our flight as it was too close to the departure time. We offered full assistance to the family regarding their flight requirements.'

Eventually, the family found a flight with Air Europa which departed one-and-a-half hours later and the boy underwent the surgery.

However,  the medical team were so concerned he would not make it in time that they considered offering the kidney and liver to someone else.

It was reported the boy, believed to be aged between eight and ten, had attempted to assure staff he was 'not going to die' on the flight.
