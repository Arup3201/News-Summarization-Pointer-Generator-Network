A mourner was told to produce her late friend's death certificate after being given a £60 parking ticket during a funeral.

Sylvian McMillan, 70, of Plaistow, east London, was ordered by Newham Council parking officers to ask her friend’s relatives for a copy of the document, to prove she was at his funeral.

The fine was issued in October as she returned from the service at the City of London Cemetery and Crematorium in Manor Park to park in a space reserved for the funeral cortege near her home.

Successful appeal: Sylvian McMillan, 70, of Plaistow, east London, was told by Newham Council parking officers to ask her late friend’s relatives for a copy of the death certificate, to prove she was at his funeral

The slots were held until 6.30pm - and the secretary was fined despite arriving just before then, prompting a four-month battle with the council’s parking team.

Miss McMillan immediately appealed the fine, but weeks later she was sent a letter warning her that she had 14 days to provide a copy of the death certificate or pay the £60.

She said: ‘I had to go to the family at such a sad time for them - I was really embarrassed. I thought that was really nasty - it’s left a very bad taste.

‘They shouldn’t be doing that. I had to go to my neighbour to get the death certificate as proof that I was at the funeral. If they’re doing that to me, what are they doing to other people?’

She sent a copy of the certificate to parking officers and threatened to take her appeal to the council parking adjudicator. But she received a letter last month saying her appeal had been successful.

Miss McMillan added: ‘I’m pleased because I was going to fight this all the way. Don’t just pay the money if you think something is not right.’

A Newham Council spokesman said procedures were now being urgently reviewed after the case.

She said: ‘Newham Council apologises for any distress that Ms McMillan and her neighbours have experienced during this sad time. 

'As requested by the relatives, bays in the residents’ parking zone were suspended to accommodate the funeral cortege and the council was also provided with registration details of these vehicles.' 

The spokesman added: 'Ms McMillan’s car was not one of these vehicles and she was issued with a Penalty Charge Notice. 

'At the time we considered it was reasonable to request a death certificate be provided as evidence. However, the council now accepts that a letter from the family confirming Ms McMillan’s attendance of the funeral would have been reasonable evidence to enable the PCN to be cancelled.’
