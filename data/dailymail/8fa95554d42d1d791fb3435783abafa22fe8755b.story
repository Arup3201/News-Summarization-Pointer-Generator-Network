Nelson Mandela’s grandson Mandla, a member of the South African parliament, has been charged with serious assault after an altercation with a teacher during which he drew a firearm, according to the South African Broadcasting Corporation (SABC).

Mr Mandela, 39, is said to have attacked Mlamli Ngudle and pointed a gun at him after the teacher reportedly crashed into a car belonging to one of Mandela's business partners at a function in the city of Mthatha.

On Thursday, at the Regional Court in the city, Senior Public Prosecutor Jongikhaya Busakwe laid out two charges against Mr Mandela – assault with intent to do grevious bodily harm and pointing a firearm, SABC said.

Mr Mandela appeared at the hearing but made no plea.

The case was postponed to February 24 after his lawyer, Kenny Oldwage, pointed out that the defence had only received the police file in the morning.

Oldwage is a high profile local attorney who also represents Paralympic sprinter Oscar Pistorius, charged with shooting dead his girlfriend on Valentines' Day in 2013.

Mr Mandela has been surrounded by controversy in recent months.

Last year he moved the graves of his grandfather’s three deceased children without permission from other family members leading to charges of grave-tampering being levelled against him.

This charge was subsequently dropped, along with a charge of bigamy.

Meanwhile, a feud has reportedly engulfed the Mandela family following the death of Nelson Mandela with relatives arguing over who will head the clan.

The ex-wife of the human rights icon, Winnie Madikizela-Mandela, has said that the oldest child, Makaziwe Mandela, 60, will head the clan – not Madla, his oldest grandchild.

Ms Makaziwe Mandela is the only living child from Mandela’s first marriage to Evelyn Mase.

The Johannesburg tabloid The Times reported in December that Mandla found himself locked out of the Mandela homestead in the Eastern Cape hamlet of Qunu, where Mandela was buried.

According to the report, Makaziwe had ordered the locks changed after she arrived while Mandla was keeping vigil next to his grandfather's coffin as the body lay in state at the Union Buildings in Pretoria.

Mandla, also known as Chief Zwelivelile, recently launched a televised tirade against his relatives, whom he accused of trying to grow rich from the Mandela name.

He also said his brother had impregnated his wife.
