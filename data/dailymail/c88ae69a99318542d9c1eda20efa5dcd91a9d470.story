So, Mauricio Pochettino’s plan was to wipe the floor with Fiorentina before next week’s second leg in Stadio Artemio Franchi. If only this European lark was so easy.

Working out what to do next in the Europa League, against a team sitting fourth in Serie A, is part of Pochettino’s coaching education. Tottenham’s manager learned some valuable lessons here.

It is a cardinal sin to concede at home in the first leg of European knockout football and Spurs must score in Florence now to stand any chance of progressing to the round of 16.

Pochettino needs a strategy because his side will play in three competitions — Barclays Premier League, Europa League and Capital One Cup — in an eight-day period. Each has its own selling point.

Buying into the idea that Spurs can win all three seems unwise because they allowed Fiorentina back into this first leg at White Hart Lane following Roberto Soldado’s dreamy opener.

Little wonder Fiorentina coach Vincenzo Montella thanked his coaching staff at the final whistle. The Italians are the only football nation who seem to prefer draws to wins.

European football is a different discipline, requiring tactical nous and improvisation, adjusting to the needs and demands of the tie as the clock runs down.

What a shame for Tottenham, because until Jose Maria Basanta’s cruel, 36th-minute equaliser, they had been much the better team.

Even without Harry Kane, strangely left on the substitutes’ bench after a nine-day rest since his last outing against Liverpool, they played with conviction in the first half.

‘They played a high-tempo pressing game as we expected, but they could not keep it up,’ said Montella, justifiably.

It was still a joy to watch Soldado get on the scoresheet with just over five minutes gone, steering his volley beyond Ciprian Tatarusano direct from Paulinho’s corner.

He puffed out his chest after that, finding the encouragement he needed to attempt an outrageous overhead kick from Christian Eriksen’s 18th-minute cross.

Tottenham’s energy was infectious, with Andros Townsend like a Duracell bunny as he shuttled up and down the right wing. Everyone is plugged into Pochettino’s ideas.

Townsend’s cushioned back-flick into the path of Paulinho, haring down the line at the midway point of the first half, was delicious.

Eventually Townsend tired, and was replaced by Erik Lamela late in the second half when his legs could no longer give him the advantage over left back Manuel Pasqual. By then Fiorentina had the upper hand, closing this first leg down in a way only an Italian team can. They are masters at this stuff.

Fiorentina’s goal punished Soldado’s reckless foul, for which he was inevitably booked, on the edge of Tottenham’s penalty area.

It is hard to apportion blame for the goal because keeper Hugo Lloris did a mighty fine job in getting across his line when Mathias Fernandes smashed the free-kick towards his near post

The botched clearance, if it deserves to be called that, fell to Bastana for the Fiorentina defender to stab beyond the France No 1.

Spurs failed to respond, unable to find any rhythm after this setback. It happens in Europe, but dealing with it is everything.

They eventually had 13 shots on goal, with an effort from Nacer Chadli hitting the bar as the home side searched for a goal that would have given them room for manoeuvre in Florence.

‘We were better in the first half,’ said Pochettino. ‘We created a lot of chances and we didn’t run out of energy.’

When Eriksen spooned another effort into the stands, he slapped the side of his head twice in the style of Andy Murray.

He knew as well as anybody, it is advantage Fiorentina.
