It will now be a crime for an Australian citizen to travel to a region considered by the government as a 'terrorist hostile area'.

Prime Minister Tony Abbott announced the dramatic new anti-terror laws today, which aim to stop the increasing number of Australians heading overseas to join terrorist fighters. It will also include the expansion of the definition of terrorism beyond 'terrorist activities' to threats on social media.

The wide-spread changes to the definition of the terror come as the Abbott government announced they would also be backing down on changes to the Racial Discrimination Act, which would have scrapped a prohibition on offending, insulting or humiliating individuals based on race.

'These are provisions, that for a person who travels to a designated spot identified as a terrorist hostile area, will be a crime,' Mr Abbott said.

Foreign Minister Julie Bishop said that in Afghanistan, up to 30 Australians had been identified as fighting alongside extremists but 'five times that number are now of interest, fighting overseas or becoming involved'.

The PM admitted the proposed changes to section 18C of the act had 'complicated' relations with ethnic groups.

Tony Abbott confirmed that the new definition would encompass the behaviour of social media jihadists such as Mohamed Elomar, who has tweeted pictures of himself holding decapitated heads, and make them liable for prosecution.

The announcement of the new laws and an extra $630 million in government spending on anti-terrorist measures, comes as Elomar, the 30-year-old former boxer fighting with terrorists in the Middle East, posted claims of how to access deadly explosives in Sydney.

The 30-year-old invited jihadists in Sydney to contact him if they want to get their hands on dynamite and grenades.

'Anyone in Sydney who is after explosives (dynamite sticks, C4 sticks, orica mine sticks, grenades ) lots more. If interested DM me,' he tweeted.

The new law is part of a suite of measures introduced by the government, under which Australians could be arrested for travelling to certain terrorist 'hot spots' without a valid humanitarian reason, causing fears that the onus of proof will rest on Australians who visit these areas to prove they did so innocently.

One of the most controversial proposed measures would see the phone and internet records of all Australians held for two years.

This would apply to metadata, rather than the content of calls and emails. Metadata is information kept by telecommunications companies - such as phone numbers, email addresses and the dates, times, locations and duration of phone calls.

Under the new laws, the tweets of Australian jihadist Mohamed Elomar could be classed as terrorism

During criminal or intelligence investigations this content can be accessed, though monitoring phone or internet use over a long period requires a warrant.

Attorney-General George Brandis said last week that data collection and surveillance was necessary for dealing with the 'insidious threat' of home-grown terrorism.

The laws have drawn criticism from Labor, the Greens and civil rights groups.

Opposition Leader Bill Shorten said the changes had been forced on the Prime Minister and Attorney-General, claiming that ‘George Brandis has been humiliated by his colleagues’.

‘Today’s back down to allow bigots to be bigots, is a victory for ordinary people,’ Mr Shorten added.

‘His (Brandis’) priority as Attorney-General has allowed racists to be racist.’

Adam Bandt, acting leader of the Australian Greens acting leader said the test for any data retention or surveillance should be whether a person is 'reasonably suspected of having committed a crime'.

'To simply say everything you do online will be stored now and made available to government is over-reach,' Mr Bandt said.   

This is the second suite of anti-terror laws introduced by the government in recent months.

In July the government introduced legislation that could allow Australian police and security agencies powers to conduct surveillance in foreign countries and tender the evidence in Australian courts as part of prosecution in terrorism cases.

The laws will allow police to conduct surveillance against Australians who go abroad to join jihadist movements such as the Islamic State of Iraq and the Levant (ISIL), pictured marching in Syria

The law would apply to countries where it was impossible to gain consent from local authorities such as countries in the grip of civil war, like Syria, or ‘failed states’ like Somalia.

Other changes include the power to suspend people's passports in order to disrupt their travel plans at short notice and allowing the Australian Secret Intelligence Service to pass on intelligence about Australians to its domestic counterpart, ASIO, under certain circumstances.

The changes are meant to address the changes to technology which have rendered some current surveillance and eavesdropping laws outdated and the rise of jihadism.

On the decision of the government to back down on Section 18C of the Racial Discrimination Act, Mr Abbott reconfirmed the law needed to changed.

'But I want the communities of our country to be our friend, not our critic,' he said.

'I want to work with the communities of our country as `Team Australia' here.

'The government's perfectly reasonable attempt to amend Section 18C has become a complication we just don't need and we won't proceed with.'
