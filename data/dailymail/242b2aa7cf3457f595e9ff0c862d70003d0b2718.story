Disappointment: Carla Bruni's promoters in Canada confirmed that her performances in a variety of cities - including Quebec and Montreal - will not go ahead

Former French first lady and pop singer Carla Bruni-Sarkozy was facing humiliation today after the cancellation of her North American tour because of appalling ticket sales.

The 46-year-old was hoping to revive her musical career after her husband, former president Nicolas Sarkozy, lost power in France a year-and-a-half ago.

The Italian ex-model appeared in a lot of expensive TV commercials, and began plugging her singing across the world media.

But Carla’s promoters in Canada today confirmed that her performances in a variety of cities - including Quebec and Montreal, which both have major french-speaking populations - in April will not now go ahead.

‘Only a handful of tickets were sold’ said one, adding that refunds were available from box offices or from Ticketmaster.

The Italian continues to struggle on in her musical heartland in France, however.

Her next gig is in the northern France seaside resort of Le Touquet on Saturday. It will go ahead and ‘plenty of tickets are still available,’ said an organiser.

She is hoping to repeat the success of ‘Quelqu'un m'a dit’ (Somebody Told Me), which came out 10 years ago, and sold around two million copies, mostly in France.

While critics praised the charming, folksy effort, Ms Bruni-Sarkozy's later albums, 'No Promises' and 'Comme si de rien n'était' (As If Nothing Had Happened), were less well-received.

 following five difficult years in power, often supports his wife at her

He is struggling with a long list of corruption enquiries, although supporters say he may make another bid for power in 2017.

After becoming Mr Sarkozy's third wife, Mrs Bruni-Sarkozy pledged to stop singing live.

Presidential advisers said it would be unseemly for a first lady to have a second role as a touring pop singer.

But soon after taking on her official duties she told a documentary film maker: ‘No more sex, no more drugs, only rock and roll.’

She started out as a model for designers like Christian Dior, Givenchy and Paco Rabanne and moved into music in 1997.

She met the recently-divorced president in November 2007 at a dinner party and married him in February 2008.
