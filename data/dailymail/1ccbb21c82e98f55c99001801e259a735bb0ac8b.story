Former Culture Secretary David Mellor has launched a scathing attack on the appointment of Judith Weir as Master of the Queen’s Music, saying he would ‘rather be thrown into a pit of scorpions’ than listen to one of her operas.

Mellor, The Mail on Sunday’s classical music critic, said the chorus of approval that greeted Weir’s appointment was solely because she was the first woman to hold the historic post.

In an outspoken article in today’s Event magazine, he writes: ‘Rather than focus on her being the first woman to hold the post, would it not be better to concentrate on whether this is a job she is capable of doing?

‘The Master of the Queen’s Music has to musically celebrate great national events in a way the British public can relate to. 

'Try as I might, I find her music pretty impenetrable and, when penetrable, unrewarding. I’d rather be thrown into a pit of scorpions than have to sit through another of her operas.’

Mellor, 65, said her appointment was another example of Britain’s music establishment ‘cocking a snook at the British people’.

‘If they can’t get someone more accessible than her, maybe it’s time the post was abolished,’ he writes.

Weir, 60, whose operas include The Vanishing Bridegroom, The Black Spider and Blond Eckbert, succeeded Sir Peter Maxwell Davies in the post last month. 

Her work has been compared to that of Benjamin Britten. One critic praised her ability to make simple musical ideas appear ‘freshly mysterious’.

The post of Master of the Queen’s duties dates back to 1626 but the precise duties attached to the role are unclear. 

Holders of the post, who receive a £15,000-a-year salary, are expected to write pieces to commemorate Royal events such as coronations, birthdays and anniversaries. 

They serve a fixed ten-year term, during which they may also act as the personal adviser to the Monarch on musical matters.

Last night, Sir Peter, Weir’s predecessor, said the attack on Weir was ‘unfair, misguided and ill-informed’.

‘I could use stronger language but I don’t think it would be in keeping with the dignity of the post,’ said Sir Peter, who recommended Weir for the job. 

‘She is a world-class composer, much admired internationally, who can write across a very wide range. This is an unfair, misguided and ill-informed attack on somebody who we should be celebrating as a wonderful talent. Judith got it because she deserved it – not because she was a woman. She is an outstanding composer.’

John Allison, editor of Opera Magazine, also came to her defence, saying: ‘Judith has always been one of the strongest contenders for the post and she has been chosen on merit. She writes music right across the genres, which does appeal to people. Who do her critics have in mind for the appointment? Andrew Lloyd Webber? Elton John?’

The praise for Weir has not always been so effusive. Her most recent opera, Miss Fortune, which opened in 2012, was panned by critics, with one branding it ‘an embarrassment’.

Weir’s spokesman refused to comment when approached by The Mail on Sunday, but on the announcement of her appointment last month, the composer said: ‘I hope to encourage everyone in the UK who sings, plays or writes music, and to hear as many of them as possible in action over the next ten years.

‘Listening is also a skill, and I intend to uphold our rights to quietness and even silence, where appropriate. Our children deserve the best we can give them, including access to live music, whether as learners, performers or listeners.’
