Bill Oddie realised in 2010 he could no longer hear the soft 'seep' of a meadow pipit going over

Not being able to hear the high-pitched tweeting of birds might not matter very much to most people. But when you’re Britain’s best-known bird-lover, such hearing loss presents a rather serious problem — as Bill Oddie recently discovered.

‘I first noticed it when I was out on Hampstead Heath bird watching four years ago — because what people don’t realise is that a very high percentage of bird watching is actually bird listening,’ says Bill, who came to fame in the zany TV series The Goodies in the Seventies, but is now more closely associated with wildlife shows.

‘The first thing you do is listen and see what is singing or calling, then you track down the bird to look at it. I can recognise the call or song of most British species.

‘I was stood with a friend who said a meadow pipit was going over — it makes a soft “seep” sound — but I couldn’t hear it. My friend said the call was quite loud and I suddenly realised that my hearing had gone. I hadn’t suspected it at all before then but I went home and tested it by playing other high-pitched bird call recordings and I couldn’t hear them either.’

The discovery was a huge blow for the former BBC Springwatch presenter, 72, who lives in Hampstead, with his wife Laura, 61, and daughter Rosie, 26.

‘I was really fed up about it as I’ve always prided myself on having very keen ears,’ says Bill, who also has two elder daughters and three grandchildren.

‘But the fact is that when you get to 50 your hearing does begin to deteriorate, and it is the top frequencies that go first. A lot of people might not notice it ever, unless you happen to like listening to birds or insects — though for some time I had found it hard to isolate whoever was speaking from general crowd noise. But it is the tragic descent that age brings!’

Although Bill first noticed he had a hearing problem back in 2010, he simply ignored the issue until relatively recently.

‘I didn’t want to admit it to myself,’ he says. ‘When you get a subtle deterioration you tend to try and live with it. If your eyes are going it’s fine to have to wear glasses or lenses, but there’s a bit of stigma attached to saying you need hearing aids; it invokes the spirit of a walking stick or frame — that you’re on the way out.

‘My wife did on occasions ask me “Are you going deaf?” to which I’d reply that it might help if she could speak up. Then about six months ago I finally said to myself “For goodness sake, hearing tests are free for everyone, see if you were right about the missing frequencies” — and I was right.’

At a Specsavers hearing test, an audiologist played bird songs to investigate Bill’s concerns.

‘Rather
 embarrassingly, the audiologist played an app with bird calls on it and
 asked if I could hear the singing — and I had to say no, I couldn’t. He
 could hear the sound but had no idea what it was, while I was the one 
who would have known what the song was but couldn’t hear it.’

Bill was fitted for hearing aids in January and now wears a pair of ‘behind the ear’ aids that sit on the back of the ear.

‘Suddenly I can hear the birds of Britain again,’ he says. ‘I went out on the Heath the other day and there was a wonderful moment as I heard a meadow pipit calling, which I hadn’t done for four or five years. To be able to hear the goldcrest again is excellent too — it’s Britain’s smallest bird and has one of the quietest songs.

‘The tree creeper is another I can hear again now — it’s like a little mouse going up and down tree trunks and you nearly always hear its wispy song first; without sound it’s hard to see.’

Though Bill hadn’t noticed any other major problems, such as missing parts of conversations, he suspects he will now realise other sounds were absent too.

‘With sight loss, you know what you’re missing as it’s out of focus or distorted, but when you can’t hear you don’t know what you’re missing. If you have the slightest doubt about your hearing — even if you haven’t in fact – you should have a hearing test.’

The hearing aids are not easily visible and Bill feels no embarrassment in wearing them.

‘They are teeny weeny little things — friends have asked if I’m wearing them as they can’t see them at all,’ he says.

‘I haven’t found them difficult to get used to either; I kept falling down stairs with contact lenses as they made my eyes water. I had the same problem with varifocals, which I’ve used for several years now, as they made me feel the stairs were rising up to meet me. But these hearing aids are a doddle.

‘I don’t wear them all the time, just out in the countryside; frankly in my office I don’t need to hear. My family are pleased about my hearing aids — though I’m not sure how much they care when I come rushing in saying I can hear the goldcrest!’

Meanwhile Bill’s general health has also improved; the crippling depression which saw him admitted to psychiatric hospital in 2009 — after he was dropped from Springwatch — has abated. Although he suffers with bipolar disorder, he has not been really unwell since.

‘I’ve been fortunate enough that I’ve been absolutely fine for years now and have had a good stretch,’ he says.

‘I’m still on medication — lithium for the bipolar and an antidepressant which I have been on for about ten years. It is the lithium that made the difference.

‘Once you take something like that, basically you stick with it unless you absolutely don’t need it any more. That’s the same whether it’s psychological or physical; nobody wants to be on medication but if you know it helps and is keeping you going, why give it up? I’ve got friends determined to come off whatever medication they’re on who keep causing themselves problems as they relapse — that sort of purism can be very destructive.’

Bill also tried ‘mindfulness therapy’ — a currently fashionable form of meditation said to improve mental health — but found it unhelpful.

‘Mindfulness and cognitive therapy get a lot of publicity but my brief experience of a few classes — though it’s not sold that way and you should do more — is that it really hasn’t happened for me at all,’ he says. ‘I giggle a lot.’

Yet with its focus on awareness and being in the present moment, the practice of mindfulness is not entirely dissimilar to bird watching. Could Bill’s passion for birds have helped his health?

‘Yes I think that’s true — it’s undeniable that being outdoors and having an interest in the outdoors is good for mental health in general,’ he says. ‘There’s no doubt that being involved with nature is good for you.’

Bill’s eyesight has also deteriorated with age. He progressed from reading glasses at around the age of 50 to wearing glasses full-time a decade later when long-distance vision became difficult. He now wears bifocals and uses reading glasses for close work.

‘The battle in the case of the birdwatcher is how to make glasses work well with binoculars as you have to use both,’ he says. ‘But manufacturers have become so sophisticated — now I have an extension on my binoculars that makes the eye-piece more acceptable to glasses — though I still wish I didn’t have them on rainy days when my glasses mist up.’

But for now it is being able to hear that is transforming his life.

‘People wonder what on earth I’m doing, just standing on the Heath looking up — but we’re actually listening for bird calls, especially at the moment, with the southern spring migrants. It’s a lovely feeling; spring will now not go racing by without me hearing it.’
