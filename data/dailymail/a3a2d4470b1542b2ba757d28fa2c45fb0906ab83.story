An AFL player has been charged with leaving the scene of an accident after hitting a parked car and failing to stop.

Geelong forward Brad Hartman, 20, was driving home on Sunday afternoon when he clipped the vehicle in St Peter's in South Australia but kept driving, according to a statement from the club.

On Monday, he reported the incident to police after discussing the matter with his father. 

Brad Hartman played his first game for the Cats on June 15 this year

He has been charged with leaving the scene of an accident and failing to stop at a stop sign. 

Geelong CEO Brian Cook said the club was disappointed and frustrated Hartman had been involved in the incident.

'There have been too many motoring related issues with our players in recent years,' Mr Cook said.

'Brad should have handled this differently by stopping and then providing his details at the time.'

Mr Cook said the club needed to reassess the way it works with its players when it comes to their responsibilities as representatives of the club.

'We will convene in the new year when the key people return to the club to develop a way forward in regard to this,' Mr Cook said.

Hartman will appear in court on a date to be set.
