These acrobatic ants proved they're not too tiny for trapeze as they dangled a cricket from a twig.Â 

The super-strong red ants really put their muscles to the test as they swung the dark brown cricket around in their own miniature circus show.

Photographer Lessy Sebastian, 48, stumbled across the antics in the garden of his parents' house one afternoon in Jakarta, Indonesia.

Mr Sebastian, a married father-of-two, said: 'I couldn't believe it when I found this army of ants performing with the cricket.

'My interest bloomed in an instant and I stopped to watch.

'What amazes me is the way the ants co-operate to carry what to them is a huge beast, several times bigger than their size.

'They bite really hard so that the cricket doesn't fall off, even in a hanging position.

'They are just finding a way to carry it together, even though it looks so hard for them.

'The movement was quite slow because of the burden, and they had to be careful not to drop the cricket.'

Mr Sebastian, from Jakarta, Indonesia, spent nearly two hours watching the insects balancing tricks from a tree branch.

Mr Sebastian, who works in advertising, said: 'I've not seen anything quite like this before - it's special because it was up in a tree with bigger prey.

'So the odds for both me and the ants are higher.

'Everybody knows ants can carry things a lot heavier than them, but to see this in action was extraordinary.'
