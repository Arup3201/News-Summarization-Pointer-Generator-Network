Super Bowl fans were outraged about the the price of Metlife Stadium concessions in Rutherford, New Jersey--especially the price of normally inexpensive beverages like hot chocolate.

Astonishingly, Hot chocolate was priced at the exorbitant amount of $11.00.

If fans wanted to buy hot chocolate in a souvenir cup it would have cost them nearly twice the price at $20.00.

The high price of eating dinner at the Super Bowl and of ordering a hot chocolate was comical to say the least

Premium canned beer was $14.00 and those who wanted bottled beer and wine had to dig into their wallets for $12.00, reports Fox News.

The souvenir soup mug was just as expensive as hot chocolate and cost $20.00 as well.

One ESPN reporter joked on twitter about 
the soup mug and wrote, 'Yes, prices are outrageous. But I have another 
question. Who goes to a #SuperBowl concession stand and orders soup?'

The stadium cheese steaks were next expensive at $16.00.

The meatball sub followed closely behind at $13.00. Mac n' Cheese was one of the more 'reasonable' food items on the menu costing around $8.00.

Fans were vocal on twitter about the sky high prices at the game.

Twitter used Marina Antunes (‏@themarina)
 wrote, 'So just how expensive is food at the #Superbowl? Hope you sold 
your first born before you went.'

Twitter user Jonathan Smith (‏@sjonathan02) wrote, 'Bruh, one would have to be drunk to pay those prices.'

Jeff G. (‏@TheSportsDude) wrote, 'Fans at the #SuperBowl r getting jacked! $16 dollar beer, $7 brownies & $20 hot chocolate.'

Gabe Lacques ‏@(GabeLacques)  wrote, 'Super Bowl hot chocolate is $11, which means price-gouging karma is responsible for the nice weather.'

For some, the Super Bowl put a super hole in their pockets. Other fans enjoyed less expensive food from the comfort of their own warm homes.

Mike Greenberg of ESPN thought the expensive soup pricing was laughable

Selling your first born is not advised, nor might it cover the cost of hot chocolate in a souvenir cup

The price of beer made the thought of purchasing it very unappealing...especially is it meant missing game time to go to the bathroom
