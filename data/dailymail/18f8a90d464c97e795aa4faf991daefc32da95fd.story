It is where the Queen retreats each summer to enjoy the peace and tranquillity of the Scottish countryside.

But her beloved Balmoral estate could soon be offering the Glastonbury Festival a bit of competition in the rural rowdiness charts.

The estate in Royal Deeside, Aberdeenshire, is considering hosting rock concerts and other live events as it looks for new ways to pay its bills.

The Balmoral estate in Aberdeenshire, which features Balmoral castle (pictured) has long been the favourite summer retreat of the Queen, but staff are now looking for new ways to pays the bills

Balmoral last hosted an open-air concert – its only one – in 2006 to mark the Queen’s 80th birthday. The event was headlined by the Welsh mezzo-soprano Katherine Jenkins and attracted a crowd of more than 4,000.

Now the estate – privately owned by the Queen and paid for by her – is looking into outdoor concerts in the spring and early summer before the Royal Family arrive for their annual stay.

Gary Marsden, visitor enterprise manager at Balmoral, did not rule out pop or rock concerts, saying: ‘We are open to any suggestions suitable for the location. We are not planning to stage concerts ourselves – it would be up to others.’

On its revamped website, Balmoral says the picturesque grounds around the castle are available for hire. ‘Balmoral provides the perfect setting for your event, with wonderful scenery and the castle providing a magnificent backdrop,’ it says.

‘Whether you are planning a charity event, gala dinner, training course, team-building exercise, car rally, conference or even a concert, we can assist.

‘Our events field is the ideal location for an outdoor function with full marquee facilities and parking nearby.’

It adds: ‘For a number of years the events field has been the venue for large events such as Balmoral Road Races and also the Bike Balmoral.

‘It is also the regular setting for smaller events such as car rallies and specialist holidays with onsite accommodation.

‘If you would like to make an appointment to discuss the possibility of using the venue facilities at Balmoral, please do not hesitate to contact us.’

More than 50 companies paid £1,000 each for corporate tables at the previous concert, in aid of the Anthony Nolan

Trust, the blood cancer charity. Midge repellent – often essential in the Highlands – was laid on for artists and guests.

The 50,000-acre estate costs around £3million a year to run and attracts more than 70,000 visitors when it opens as a tourist attraction between April and the end of July.

However, the income they bring only meets around half the estate’s costs.Last month MPs said the Queen should rent out her palaces and homes to help pay for repairs.

A committee said she had been failed by advisers who spent too much money and did not do enough to save her deteriorating palaces.

More than a third of the royal estate has been found to be below ‘target condition’, with Buckingham Palace and Windsor Castle in urgent need of repair.

Balmoral’s efforts to pay its way have been boosted by updating its online gift shop to offer a new collection of 21st-century souvenirs.

The range includes Harris Tweed laptop bags and iPad cases, tiaras and even pink princess T-shirts, with matching socks.

Also on offer is a range of crystal jewellery said to be modelled on items worn by the Queen down the years.
