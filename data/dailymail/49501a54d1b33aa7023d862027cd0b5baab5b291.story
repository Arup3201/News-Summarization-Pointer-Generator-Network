Fateful night: Evan Dube, 19, was at a barbecue on the beach in Lerwick when he went for a swim just after 9pm

A U.S. student who was working on an archaeological project in the Shetland Islands collapsed and died after going for an evening swim.

Evan Dube, 19, was at a barbecue on a beach in Lerwick with a group of ten students from Bates College in Lewiston, Maine, before his death on Saturday night.

The first-year student swam out into the sea soon after arriving at 9pm.

'Evan went into the water and after coming ashore appears to have collapsed,' said police.

An ambulance arrived in minutes, and Mr Dube was then airlifted to a nearby hospital, but all resuscitation attempts failed, and an autopsy is taking place today.

The teenager, from Plaistow, New Hampshire, was taking part in the Shetland Islands Climate and Settlement Project, a study involving students from several higher education institutions from Maine.

It was looking at the severe climate transformations of the most northern of the Scottish Isles, particularly at a settlement in Quendale Valley that was entirely buried by sandstorms and subsequently abandoned between 1690 and 1710AD.

Mr Dube's college released a statement saying: 'Bates College has been shaken and deeply saddened to learn that first-year student Evan Dube died on Saturday night, May 19, in the Shetland Islands, Scotland.

Tragedy: The teenager was described by his college as 'serious, exuberant and a caring friend'

Shocked community: Police said the teenager collapsed after coming out of the water and could not be resuscitated

'At this time we have no other information about the incident to offer— simply that we have lost a member of our Bates community long before his time.

'Evan’s fellow students in Scotland are receiving grief counseling and will return to Boston on Tuesday.'

Bates said Mr Dube, a Buddhist, would be remembered as 'a young man who was studious and serious, exuberant and funny - and a caring friend.'

Dean of Students Tedd Goundie wrote in an email to the student body: 'We will be absorbing this terrible loss for many days and long into the future.

'Please join me in keeping Evan’s family and friends in your thoughts and prayers.'
