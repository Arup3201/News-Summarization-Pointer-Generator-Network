Hearing: Omaima Nelson in court in Santa Ana, California, in 1993 when she was jailed for 27 years-to-life

A cannibal wife branded the Californian Hannibal Lecter after killing and eating her new husband for Thanksgiving 20 years ago has again been denied parole.

Egyptian-born Omaima Nelson, 43, who cooked William Nelson and ate his ribs with BBQ sauce, lost her bid for freedom after a five-hour hearing at the Central California Women's Facility in Chowchilla, where she is serving a life sentence.

In 1993 the then 23-year-old was convicted of murdering her 56-year-old husband in a grotesque killing that authorities likened to 'Silence of the Lambs.'

The murderer represented herself at the hearing yesterday and argued for freedom because she has become a changed person and wanted 'to live the good life God meant.'

She claimed she was sorry, though continued to say she killed in self-defence.

'If I didn't defend my life, I would have been dead. I'm sorry it happened, but I'm glad I lived, I'm sorry I dismembered him,' she said.

Nelson had put on red shoes, a red hat and red lipstick before chopping up and cooking her husband's body.

The authorities stated she prepared his ribs like in a restaurant and she said aloud, 'It's so sweet.'

But at the parole hearing this week, Nelson shook her head and denied eating her husband.

'I swear to God I did not eat any part of him. I am not a monster,' she said.

Commissioner Cynthia Fritz then asked, 'What was your purpose in cooking him?'

Nelson declined to answer the question.

Despite her plea a two-person panel of the state Board of Parole found that Nelson, a former model and nanny, continued to be a risk to society.

Commissioners said she had not accepted full responsibility for the slaying, nor completed educational or vocational programs while incarcerated that would help her lead a productive life outside prison.

Nelson was 'blaming anybody but herself,' deputy commissioner Robert Barese said.

Commissioners cited Nelson's criminal history, including shoplifting, car theft and assault with a firearm, and her failure to abide by prison rules, including violations for fighting, battering a staff member, hiding contraband, stealing, failure to comply with instructions and arguing.

They also found that Nelson had shown a pattern of exchanging sex with older men for money and goods, which in the past had led to violence.

William Nelson's daughter Margaret Nelson - who was 15 at the time of the murder - gave a long, tearful speech in which she said her father's murder meant he couldn't attend her wedding or meet her eight-week-old daughter.

'I don't have the language to explain the pain of my father not being there,' she said.

'I don't know the adequate punishment for a murderer who doesn't even 
leave a family a body to mourn over. But I do know you don't let her 
out.'

Nelson will not be eligible to seek parole again for 15 years - the maximum period she can be held without another hearing, the commissioners said.

Nelson sat silently as her plea for parole was rejected.

During the original trial, Nelson told jurors that William, her husband of three weeks, had sexually assaulted and beat her, including over that Thanksgiving weekend, and that she committed the acts in self-defence.

But prosecutors found evidence suggesting that Nelson killed her husband to obtain his money and other property.

She tied up her husband, killed him, decapitated, dismembered and disemboweled the body over the course of a weekend, churning his parts through a garbage disposal that neighbours said ran non-stop in the hours after the murder.

Authorities found some of Nelson's body parts stuffed in bags and mixed with leftover turkey, including a bag containing his entrails on the floor of his Corvette car.

They found the couple's Costa Mesa home had blood pools on the floor, blood-stained sheets and walls, and no evidence of rape.

The man's hands had been fried in oil and his head boiled and stuffed in a freezer.

Nelson denied intending to kill her husband or planning to take his money, but she admitted to stabbing William in the chest and neck with a pair of scissors, striking him with an iron and throwing a lamp at him as he sexually assaulted her.

She said that after the slaying she 'freaked out,' fell into a trance-like state, and spent 12 hours hacking up the body to simplify disposal.

She claimed to have little memory of his dismemberment, but recalled cutting off his penis and his ring finger, cleaning the apartment and packaging the body parts.

Jurors found Nelson not guilty of first-degree murder, citing insufficient evidence of premeditation, but convicted her of second-degree murder. They also found Nelson guilty of assaulting a former boyfriend with a gun.

Nelson appealed but lost in 1995. In 2006, she expressed remorse for killing her husband and sought parole claiming she had found salvation as a born-again Christian.

She had also married an older man from outside prison, who has since died.
