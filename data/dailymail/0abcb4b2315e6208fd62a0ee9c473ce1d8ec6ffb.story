The Australian Defence Force have issued a warning to personnel about wearing their uniform in public in light of an alleged attack on a Navy officer on Thursday.

Police are investigating allegations a uniformed Navy member was attacked and threatened outside his home in Sydney's north-western suburbs this morning. 

A Defence spokesperson said officers have been told to use their judgment when considering going out in uniform.

'ADF members have been advised to consider where they are going, to be aware of their surroundings, and to exercise commonsense and judgement when considering where and when to wear uniform in public,' the statement read. 

Around 6.30am on Thursday morning a 41-year-old man was allegedly set upon by two men of Middle Eastern appearance in Bella Vista.

A police spokeswoman told Daily Mail Australia the man was dressed in full uniform when the incident occurred.

The alleged attack occurred in Bella Vista, in the the city's north-western suburbs

It is understood the man was on his way to work.

Police said the man suffered minor bruising. 

The navy member reported the alleged incident to police by phone and then in person at Kings Cross Police Station, which is located near the Navy Base in Garden Island. 

According to Nine News, the man told police his attackers had threatened to cut his throat.

Muslim community leader Dr Jamal Rifi tweeted that such an attack was 'abominable'.  

Chief of the Defence Force Mark Binskin recently decided to raise the alert level at all of the military's bases and establishments.

The nation's terror alert level was raised to 'high' earlier this month

The decision followed the Australian Security and Intelligence Organisation (ASIO) raising the nation's terror alert level to 'high', meaning an attack is likely.

Terror suspect Numan Haider was shot dead on Tuesday night after he allegedly stabbed two police officers in Melbourne's south-east. 

The largest counter-terrorism raids in the nation's history, involving more than 800 police in New South Wales alone, occurred earlier this month.
