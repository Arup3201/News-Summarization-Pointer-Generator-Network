Liverpool defender Jose Enrique made the most of his day off with an indulgent visit to the Hale Country Club and Spa in Altrincham. 

The luxury centre features a gym, three swimming pools, steam room, sauna and restaurant while offering a variety of facial and body treatments.   

The 29-year-old left-back and his long-term girlfriend Amy Jaine seemed to enjoy the facilities and posted pictures of their day on Enrique's official Instagram account.

Following the spa treatments, Enrique and Jaine dined out and met up with some friends. 

Enrique signed for Liverpool back in 2011 in a reported £6 million move from Newcastle United. 

He has since made 96 appearances for The Reds and scored two goals. However, the Spaniard has found regular first-team football hard to come by in the last two seasons due a mix of injuries and squad rotation. 

Enrique has three caps for Spain's Under 21s, but is yet to receive a call-up for the senior national side.
