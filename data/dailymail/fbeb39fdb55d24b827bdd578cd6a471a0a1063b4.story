Survivors of Asiana Airlines Flight 214 have made an emotional pilgrimage to the site of the crash, which killed two Chinese schoolgirls on Saturday.

A group of passengers from the flight, which lost its tail in the fatal landing in San Francisco, were taken to the runway to see the wreckage on Wednesday.

Three buses carried survivors to the Boeing 777, which is still in the spot where it came to rest after hitting the seawall and catching fire as it skidded across the runway.

They were seen touring the outside of the wrecked plane that they had fled from only a few days before.

In the moments after Flight 214 crash landed in San Francisco on Saturday, passengers were told to remain in their seats while the crew contacted the control tower.

It was not until 90 seconds later that the plane was evacuated after a fire was spotted, according to the National Transportation Safety Board.

At that point, the doors were opened and
the escape slides were inflated as passengers fled the plane, which clipped a seawall and snapped off its tail as it landed on Saturday.

Two flight attendants were trapped by 
slides, which had inflated inside the aircraft during the crash.

As more details about the aftermath of the crash emerge, the NTSB has said that the pilot who was making his first landing in a Boeing 777 at that airport reported being blinded by a light at about 500ft. which was 34 seconds before the impact.

It was also the first time that Lee Gang-kuk, a 46-year-old pilot with 35 hours' experience flying a Boeing 777, had been paired with his trainer Lee Jeong-Min.

Although the men had years of aviation experience, the flight on Saturday involved unfamiliar duties, and it was the first time they had flown together.

NTSB chairman Deborah Hersman said the pilot told investigators he was blinded by a light at the point when the aircraft began to slow and drop.

She said lasers have not been ruled out, and it was unclear if the flash might have played a role in the crash.

Experts say investigators trying to piece together what went wrong will consider the report about the light and many other factors, including the pairing of the pilots, who were assigned to work together through a tightly regulated system developed after several deadly crashes in the 1980s.

The NTSB 'is definitely going to focus on what type of policy Asiana had in terms of crew pairing,' former NTSB chairman James Hall said.

'That's what the airline needs to do, be responsible so that in the cockpit you're matching the best people, especially when you're introducing someone to a new aircraft.'

Pilots are typically paired by management and are not allowed to choose their partners in the cockpit.

Massachusetts Institute of Technology aeronautics professor Mary Cummings said it was common for two commercial pilots to be assigned to the same flight without working together before. Airlines have standardized, formal procedures to help teams who have not worked together before.

'Research would tell you that crew pairing with the same people over longer periods of time is safer,' she said. 'When two people fly together all the time, you get into a routine that's more efficient. You have experience communicating.'

Jeff Skiles, a US Airways first officer, said that with the right training it should not matter if a pilot new to a plane is paired with a pilot making his first trip as a training captain.

'Everybody had to have their first time,' Mr Skiles said. 'You can't show up and have 500 hours experience in aircraft.'

Mr Skiles was the co-pilot of the jet that was landed on the Hudson by Captain Chesley 'Sully' Sullenberger, after it lost thrust in both engines after colliding with geese.

The skillful flying of Captain Sullenberger and teamwork between him and Mr Skiles was credited for a near-perfect water landing on the Hudson in New York that saved the lives of everyone on board.

The January 2009 accident happened after the pilots had been paired together only four days before.

Details emerging from pilot interviews, cockpit recorders and control-tower communications indicate that Lee Gang-kuk, who was halfway through his certification training for the Boeing 777, and his co-pilot and instructor, Lee Jeong-Min, thought the aircraft's speed was being controlled by an autothrottle.

Inspectors found that the autothrottle had been 'armed', or made ready for activation, Ms Hersman said. However, it has not yet been determined if it had been engaged.

When the pilots realized the plane was approaching the waterfront runway too low and slow, they both reached for the throttle.

Passengers heard a roar as the plane revved in a last-minute attempt to abort the landing.

The two pilots at the controls during the accident had also been in the cockpit for takeoff. They then rested during the flight while a second pair of pilots took over.

The two pairs swapped again about 90 minutes before landing, giving the trainee a chance to fly during the more challenging approach phase.

The investigation is ongoing, and Ms Hersman cautioned against speculating about the cause of the crash. She stressed that even if the autothrottle malfunctioned, the pilots were ultimately responsible for control of the airliner.

'Let me be very clear: The crew is required to maintain a safe aircraft,' she said on Tuesday.

Airspeed is 'one of the very critical things that needs to be monitored on the approach to landing', she added. 'So we need to understand what was going on in the cockpit and on the aircraft.'

A third pilot who was in the cockpit jumpseat to monitor the landing told investigators he could not see the approach because the tail was so low the aircraft's angle had blocked his view of the ground.

The tail ultimately smashed into a seawall and broke off before the rest of the fuselage hit and ground and spun across the tarmac.

Survivor Brian Thomson, who was returning from a martial arts competition in South Korea and walked away without injury, said he was not concerned about lack of experience in the cockpit.

'Everyone starts a career someway, somehow. Starts a new plane someway, somehow. They have to have training,' he said.

The Air Line Pilots Association, a union representing more than 50,000 pilots at 33 American and Canadian airlines, has complained that the NTSB is releasing incomplete, out-of-context information that could lead to unfair characterizations of Asiana's pilots.

'Without the full body of facts surrounding a catastrophic event, partial or incomplete information can lead to erroneous conclusions and, in turn, skew the perception of individuals' behavior. This could then lead to misguided assessments of the crew's intentions and actions,' the union said in a statement.

Progress: NTSB chairman Deborah Hersman is giving regular updates on the investigation

However, Ms Hersman said the NTSB was representing passengers and trying to be transparent.

Nearly 20 survivors remained in hospital on Wednesday, and families have started arriving to be at their bed sides.

Three flight attendants who were thrown from the aircraft during the accident were among those hurt.

One of them has been identified as 25-year-old Maneenat Tinnakul, whose father has been given a visa so he can visit her.

Another flight attendant, identified as Sirithip Singhakarn, was reportedly in intensive care.

Fire officials have also continued their investigation into whether a fire truck may have run over one of the two teenagers killed in the crash.

Wang Linjia and Ye Mengyuan were part of a larger group of students due to attend a Christian summer camp.
