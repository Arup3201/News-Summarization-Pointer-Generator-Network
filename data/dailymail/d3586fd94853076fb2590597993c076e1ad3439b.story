Argentina wore black armbands for Alfredo Di Stefano, who died on Monday, remained an iconic figure in his country of birth despite playing more for Spain than his homeland. A moment of remembrance before the match was cut bizarrely short, lasting only about 20 seconds, before referee Cuneyt Cakir ended it, allowing only brief applause. The team were also mourning the loss of one of the journalists covering them. Jorge Luis Lopez, from the Argentine sports daily Ole, was killed in a car crash the night before the game.

Respect: Lionel Messi and his Argentina team-mates wore black armbands in memory of Alfredo Di Stefano

The Argentine fans were in no mood to let their hosts and rival forget the humiliation of the night before. ‘Siete, siete,’ or ‘seven, seven’ they chanted as they held up seven fingers, provoking fury and indignation all round. They have already riled the Brazilians by constantly goading them with a song about how they’ve been crying ever since Claudio Caniggia scored against them in 1990 and how Maradona is better than Pele.

There was a Barcelona love-in before the match with Holland manager Louis van Gaal and assistant Patrick Kluivert, both heroes at the club for their respective managerial and playing roles, embracing Leo Messi warmly in the tunnel. Van Gaal it was who set the foundations in stone for Messi’s great Barcelona team, giving Xavi, Carles Puyol, Andres Iniesta and Victor Valdes their debuts. Messi though was just arriving as a 13-year-old at the club as Van Gaal was leaving.

Van Gaal maintained his reputation for tactical decisiveness on Wednesday night. Whilst not quite in the Tm Krul league of substitutions, the Holland manager had clearly seen enough of Bruno Martins Indi attempting to get to grips with Leo Messi – literally at times – by half time and replaced him with Daryl Janmaat. Danny Blind moved to join the back three with Janmaat wide right. With Van Gaal at least you know if it isn’t working, change will come.

Organisers claim the Sao Paulo Arena is the finished article and they had always planned to have temporary stands at each ends, which are open to the elements. Fans seated in those areas were lucky that the heavy rain that had fallen in the afternoon in Sao Paulo held off for the match, though they were still exposed to the winter drizzle and a cold wind.

The World Players’ Union, FIFPRO, is likely to make another intervention after Javier Mascherano clashed heads with Georginio Wijnaldum on 20 minutes. FIFPRO were previously unhappy when Uruguayan Alvaro Pereira played on despite receiving a heavy blow to his head against England and called for independent doctors to assess head injuries. Mascherano was clearly dazed and staggering around, indicating concussion, after the clash but understandably was determined to play on.
