Barcelona boss Luis Enrique has been given the perfect medical advice to ensure he does not see any criticism of his management - by being banned from reading the newspaper by his doctor!

The Calatans drew 0-0 away at Gefafe on Saturday and a section of Barca supporters have criticised Enrique for his constant tinkering of team selection and formations.

But Enrique insists he is not concerned by the criticism and, in fact, he has not even seen the majority of it due to his ban on reading about it in the press on medical grounds.

Speaking on Monday, Enrique said: 'I haven't read the criticism for some time now. My doctor told me not to.

'I like my team to play good, attractive, easy-on-the-eye football, though that doesn't mean there aren't matches when you play poorly and end up getting points.'

Real Madrid now lead Barca by four points at the head of La Liga following the weekend's matches.

Yet Enrique remains unconcerned by the gap their rivals have opened up ahead of them.

He continued: 'The four-point lead? It's nothing definitive.

'We were four points ahead earlier in the season and the gap evaporated quickly.'

Interestingly, despite the criticism over his constant tinkering of the Barca starting XI, Enrique is adamant he will continue to change the team as often as he feels necessary.

He added: 'We're going to be constantly making changes and evolving. I'm not disappointed with what we've done so far.'
