President Barack Obama brushed aside sharp European criticism on Monday, 
suggesting that all nations spy on each other as the French and Germans 
expressed outrage over alleged U.S. eavesdropping on European Union diplomats. 
American analyst-turned-leaker Edward Snowden, believed to still be at Moscow's 
international airport, applied for political asylum to remain in Russia.

Russian President Vladimir Putin, in a statement he 
acknowledged sounded odd, told reporters in Moscow that Snowden would have to 
stop leaking U.S. secrets if he wanted asylum in Russia - and he added that 
Snowden seemed unwilling to stop publishing leaks of classified material. At the 
same time, Putin said that he had no plans to turn over Snowden to the United 
States.

A statement purportedly by Snowden and posted Monday on the 
Wikileaks website criticized Obama for 'using citizenship as a weapon.' The 
statement could not be independently authenticated as being from Snowden 
himself. Wikileaks is the anti-secrecy group that has adopted Snowden and his 
cause.

Scrambling: US President Barack Obama went on the defensive Monday, saying all countries spy on one another

Obama, in an African news conference with Tanzanian 
President Jakaya Kikwete, said the U.S. would provide allies with information 
about new reports that the National Security Agency had bugged EU offices in 
Washington, New York and Brussels. But he also suggested such activity by 
governments would hardly be unusual.

'We should stipulate that every intelligence service -not 
just ours, but every European intelligence service, every Asian intelligence 
service, wherever there's an intelligence service - here's one thing that 
they're going to be doing: They're going to be trying to understand the world 
better, and what's going on in world capitals around the world,' he said. 'If 
that weren't the case, then there'd be no use for an intelligence service.'

The latest issue concerns allegations of U.S. spying on 
European officials in the German news weekly Der Spiegel. French President 
Francois Hollande on Monday demanded that the U.S. immediately stop any such 
eavesdropping and suggested the widening controversy could jeopardize next 
week's opening of trans-Atlantic trade talks between the United States and 
Europe.

'We cannot accept this kind of behavior from partners and 
allies,' Hollande said on French television.

Limbo: NSA whistleblower Edward Snowden is trapped in Moscow's Sheremetyevo International Airport while awaiting asylum

German government spokesman Steffen Seibert told reporters 
in Berlin, 'Eavesdropping on friends is unacceptable.' He declared, 'We're not 
in the Cold War anymore.'

Even before the latest disclosures, talks at the upcoming 
free-trade sessions were expected to be fragile, with disagreements surfacing 
over which items should be covered or excluded from an agreement. The United 
States has said there should be no exceptions. But France has called for 
exempting certain cultural products, and other Europeans do not appear eager to 
give up longtime agricultural subsidies.

Obama said the Europeans 'are some of the closest allies 
that we have in the world.' But he added, 'I guarantee you that in European 
capitals, there are people who are interested in, if not what I had for 
breakfast, at least what my talking points might be should I end up meeting with 
their leaders. That's how intelligence services operate.'

Nonetheless, Obama said he'd told his advisers to 'evaluate 
everything that's being claimed' and promised to share the results with 
allies.

Meanwhile, the Interfax news agency said a Russian consular 
official has confirmed that Snowden had asked for asylum in Russia.

Interfax cited Kim Shevchenko, the duty officer at the 
Russian Foreign Ministry's consular office in Moscow's Sheremetyevo airport, as 
saying that Snowden's representative, Sarah Harrison, handed over his request on 
Sunday.

Snowden, in legal limbo, is believed to have been in the 
airport's transit zone since his arrival from Hong Kong on June 23. The U.S. has 
annulled his passport, and Ecuador, where he has hoped to get asylum, has been 
giving off mixed signals about offering him shelter.

Mr. Worldwide: Edward Snowden has become a household name around the world for leaking top secret NSA documents pertaining to the agency's surveillance activities

'If he wants to go somewhere and there are those who would 
take him, he is welcome to do so,' Putin said. 'If he wants to stay here, there 
is one condition: He must stop his activities aimed at inflicting damage on our 
American partners, no matter how strange it may sound coming from my lips.'

Obama said 'there have been high-level discussions with the 
Russians' about Snowden's situation.

'We don't have an extradition treaty with Russia. On the 
other hand, you know, Mr. Snowden, we understand, has traveled there without a 
valid passport, without legal papers. And you know we are hopeful that the 
Russian government makes decisions based on the normal procedures regarding 
international travel and the normal procedures regarding international travel 
and the normal interactions that law enforcement has. So I can confirm 
that.'

Putin didn't mention any Snowden effort to seek asylum in 
Russia, and spokesman Dmitry Peskov declined to say what the Russian response 
might be. Putin insisted that Snowden wasn't a Russian agent and that Russian 
security agencies hadn't contacted him.

Three U.S. officials, speaking on condition of anonymity 
because they weren't authorized to publicly discuss the Snowden case, said 
Washington's efforts were focused primarily on persuading Russia to deport 
Snowden either directly to the United States or to a third country, possibly in 
eastern Europe, that would then hand him over to U.S. authorities.

In a sign of the distrust the latest report had revealed, 
the German government said it had launched a review of its secure government 
communications network and the EU's executive, the European Commission, ordered 'a comprehensive ad hoc security sweep.'

U.S. Secretary of State John Kerry said Monday he didn't 
know the details of the allegations, but he still played them down, maintaining 
that many nations undertake various activities to protect their national 
interests. Kerry failed to quell the outrage from allies, including France, 
Germany and Italy.

A spokesman for Herman Van Rompuy, the president of the 
European Council, said, 'The European Union has demanded and expects full and 
urgent clarification by the U.S. regarding the allegations.'

According to Der Spiegel's report, which it said was partly 
based on information leaked by Snowden, NSA planted bugs in the EU's diplomatic 
offices in Washington and infiltrated the building's computer network. Similar 
measures were taken at the EU's mission to the United Nations in New York, the 
magazine said.

It also reported that NSA used secure facilities at NATO 
headquarters in Brussels to dial into telephone maintenance systems that would 
have allowed it to intercept senior officials' calls and Internet traffic at a 
key EU office nearby.

As for Snowden, White House national security spokeswoman 
Caitlin Hayden said the White House won't comment on specific asylum requests 
but reiterated its message to all countries that he 'needs to be expelled back 
to the U.S. based on the fact that he doesn't have travel documents and the 
charges pending against him.'

Regarding possible effects on U.S. interactions with Russia, 
she said it remains the case 'that we don't want this issue to negatively impact 
the bilateral relationship.'
