An $11.5 million Picasso has been seized by the Justice Department on behalf of Italy because the widow who was trying to sell it has been charged with embezzlement in Naples.

It is alleged that the 1909 painting, which was being offered for private sale in New York, was bought with money made through criminal activity.

Gabriella Amati, who was selling Compotier et Tasse, or Fruit Bowl and Cup, is facing charges of embezzling $44 million in tax paid by Naples residents.

Seized: The Picasso, worth $11.5 million is being held in New York on behalf of the Italian government

Italian courts allege that the widow and her late husband Angelo Maj were involved in a scheme that set up fraudulent service contracts, forged accounting records and had inflated operational expenses, according to Yahoo.

It was claimed that between 2001 and 2009, taxes paid for waste removal and other services in Naples were embezzled.

At the time of the couple's arrest, along with three other people alleged to be involved with the 
scheme in 2011, authorities seized valuable paintings but, according to Corriere
Della Sera, a Picasso was not found.

Italian prosecutors allege that the couple used money made from their criminal activity to buy the painting.

Customs officials seized the painting 
after it was sent to New York to be offered for private sale on May 21. U.S. 
District Judge Victor Marrero then signed a restraining order at the 
request of the Italian government.

'We are pleased to have played a role in
securing this valuable work of art by the celebrated artist, Pablo 
Picasso, on behalf of the Italian government,' US Attorney Preet 
Bharara said.

The restraining order prevents the Picasso from being sold or moved from the court's jurisdiction.

Charges: Naples, where the owner of the Picasso is accused of embezzling $44 million in tax

'Restraining this valuable artwork is an effort to help recover some of the estimated $44 million that this couple stole from the tax-paying citizens of Naples,' Immigration and Customs director John Morton said.

'Our commitment to "taking the profit 
out of crime" transcends national boundaries and is the operating 
principle of our asset forfeiture program.' Mr Morton told BBC News.

U.S. officials are working closely with courts in Milan to arrange for the Picasso to be returned to Italy.

'Our asset forfeiture section is committed to finding and 
securing every last penny of criminal proceeds and putting those 
ill-gotten proceeds back in the hands of victims, regardless of where 
they reside,' Acting Assistant Attorney General 
Raman said.
