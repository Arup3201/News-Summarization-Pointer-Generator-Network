Tragedy struck in the Cape Cod town of Hyannis on Monday when an 8-year-old boy perished in a raging shed fire near his home. 

Savvas Yianasmidis was with two other boys, both 8, when some friendly fun turned into a dangerous bet: $100 to set some paper on fire.

When the fire began to burn too hot, one of the boys kicked what he thought was a can of water onto the blaze--only it turned out to be gasoline.

Tragedy: 8-year-old Savvas Yianasmidis died Monday in the blaze, which started as he and two others were playing with a lighter

Authorities say one of the children was playing with a lighter.

Cape and Islands District Attorney Michael O’Keefe Savvas was in the shed playing on a laptop with the two friends.

The boy who kicked the can of gasoline told CBS Boston that he and the other surviving boy leaped over the growing flames, but Yianasmidis was too afraid. 

Authorities received a call at about 5:30 p.m. and by the time firefighters arrived the 8-foot-by-12-foot shed was engulfed.

Neighbors tried using a garden hose to extinguish the fire.

The victim was found in the shed’s remains after the fire was doused.

State fire Marshal Stephen Coan called the blaze a “horrific, tragic” accident.

It remains under investigation.
