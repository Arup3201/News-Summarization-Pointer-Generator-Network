A  Scrooge got his comeuppance this Christmas when he allegedly tried to grab an elderly woman's purse and got a beat down by her senior friends instead.

Armed robber Larry Kent Jr., 45, attempting to nab the purse of a 68-year-old woman outside of a Chinese Food restaurant in Winter Haven, Florida got tackled to the ground by the woman's geriatric friends aged 73 and 66.

'Mr. Kent is spending his Christmas, and we can only hope many, many, more behind bars,' Jamie Brown with the Winter Haven Police Department told Fox.

No match for the seniors: Armed alleged robber Larry Kent Jr., 45, attempting to nab the purse of a 68-year-old woman got tackled to the ground by the woman's geriatric friends aged 73 and 66

Pinned: Larry Kent Jr., 45, is no match for this group of riled up senior citizens in Florida on Christmas  day 

Defeat: Larry Kent Jr., 45, may have assumed that a 68-year-old woman would be an easy target to steal from but the alleged thief was proven wrong and taken into custody

The old woman, who has not been named, refused to let the robber take advantage of her and steal her purse.

Two of the woman's friends helped pin Kent to the ground before the police arrived to put the alleged thief in the slammer.

A witness Pat Cameron heard the commotion and jumped into the fight to ensure that none of the seniors got hurt.

'His legs were kicking this that and the other, so I grabbed his legs so he wouldn't kick the others,' said Pat Cameron.

'I didn't care that he had a gun, I just wanted to help them out,' he added.

Pat's wife Glenda also witnessed the fight but she opted out of getting too involved.

In custody: The alleged thief is a convicted felon who's been arrested 17 times in Polk County 

Witness: 'His legs were kicking this that and the other, so I grabbed his legs so he wouldn't kick the others,' said witness Pat Cameron who stepped in to help stave off the alleged bandit 

'I was a little concerned,' said Pat's wife Glenda.

'I said just don't get involved but I'm glad he did go over because it could've been me.'

None of the people involved in the fight were injured and police discovered Kent's gun was merely a BB gun.

'I even said to the police officers don't mess with the seniors they fight back,' said Glenda Cameron.

Kent is in jail without bond and has been charged with felony crimes including robbery with a firearm, battery on person 65 or older, possession of methamphetamine and possession of drug paraphernalia, reports The Tampa Tribune.

Fox reports he's a convicted criminal who's been arrested 17 times in Polk County.

Strong seniors: 'I even said to the police officers don't mess with the seniors they fight back,' said witness Glenda Cameron who saw the alleged thief and her husband step in
