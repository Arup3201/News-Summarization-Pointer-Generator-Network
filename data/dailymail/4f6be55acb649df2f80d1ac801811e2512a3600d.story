Anthony Wartson stashed a 'criminal arsenal' 

A man who stored an arsenal of weapons for serious criminals has been jailed after his DNA was found on guns and an exploding bullet.

Anthony Wartson operated a virtual safe house for criminals, storing a sawn-off shot gun and other weapons.

He had created a 'criminal arsenal' in an attic but was foiled when his DNA was found on the triggers of a sawn-off shotgun and a revolver, as well as on a glove that contained a 'dum-dum' bullet, designed to explode on impact.

The 44-year-old had tried to claim he thought he had been given a bag of mobile phones, not weapons. But the judge dismissed this and jailed him for five years.  

Philip Standfast, prosecuting at Bradford Crown Court, said officers had been investigating a burglary when they found the cache at a property in Bradford in April last year.

Mr Standfast said Wartson was not connected to the house but his DNA was linked to the cache of weapons.

Wartson, of Bradford, West Yorkshire, admitted possessing prohibited weapons and ammunition.

He had pleaded guilty on a basis that he thought he had been given a bag of mobile phones but the Recorder of Bradford, Judge Roger Thomas QC, described that as 'nonsensical'.

He said criminals with such weaponry would not entrust them to 'some hapless drunk'. 

He added: 'He was a safe house for a criminal organiser of weapons, and serious weaponry at that.'

Wartson was tracked down after his DNA was found on several guns that he had been stashing for criminals 

His DNA was found on a sawn-off shotgun, discovered when police were investigating a burglary in Bradford 

The 44-year-old's DNA was also found on the trigger of a revolver, linking him to the arsenal of weapons 

Shotgun cartridges were found at Wartson's home 

One of the guns found, which was not connected to Wartson, had been used in a shooting.  

Mr Thomas added: 'You were a foil for somebody with this serious weaponry, to store it away from the eyes of the police.

You say the weaponry went back to the person who asked you to store it, and it did. 

'Clear it is, for a period of time you gave safe haven to this serious weaponry.

'No doubt some sort of reward coming in your direction.'

Anne-Marie Hutton, mitigating, said Wartson's failings were due to his misuse of alcohol. She said his involvement with the weapons was brief.

After the case, Detective Inspector Ian Bryar, of the Bradford District Quartz Team, said: 'Police are committed to removing firearms from Bradford district to make sure that the people who live and work here remain safe.

'Gun crime will not be tolerated and anyone who is found to be involved in firearms incidents, or convicted of possession of a firearm can expect to receive a prison sentence.'
