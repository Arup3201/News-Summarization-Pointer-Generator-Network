A Facebook page in France inciting racial hatred and calling for the elimination of Roma gypsies has been taken down following a public outcry.

Adopte un Gitan - translated into English as Adopt a Gypsy - caused outrage with one rights' group in France when it was posted earlier this month.

Roma group Amaro Drom, based in Bouches-du-Rhone in the south of the country, reported the matter to police for incitement of racial hatred, when it got wind of the page, which received 800 'likes'.

Outrage: The Facebook page that was accused of inciting racial hatred has been taken down, but not before it was 'liked' by 800 users

The page labelled Roma gypsys 
'thieves'. One image on the page showed members of the musical group the Gypsy 
Kings covered in yellow stars reading 'Jew'.

President Véronique Labbe told English speaking news service The Local: 'We cannot allow this flood of hatred against the gypsy community on a social network.'

In her complaint, shared on her blog,
Ms Labbe pointed out that one post on the page read: 'Gypsies? We shouldn’t adopt
them, we have to eliminate them.'

Ms Labbe argued the people who 'liked' the page should be reprimanded and has urged that Facebook be monitored more closely in future.

She said: 'I
hope the police will look at social networks more closely, because 
anyone young or old can start a page or open an account and incite 
racial hatred against Roma people or anyone they want. It should not be that way.'

She is refusing to let the matter lie, saying the page was closed down, only to reopen last Tuesday.

She said: 'Well, it was already closed down once, and then it was opened again on Tuesday – why?

'So this is definitely not the end of the story.'

The UK's life president of the Gypsy Council Hughie Smith backed Ms Labbe.

He said: 'This does not surprise me at all. It's nothing new as far as we're concerned.

'We've had it for centuries, people trying to get rid of us and we're still here.

'It sounds to me as if it's a load of
crackpots. I think Facebook should be providing some kind of filter for
this kind of thing.

'It's always been going on, but there are pockets in different parts of this country that are worse than others and we've got to work hard to be accepted.'

The page's creator has not yet been identified, although Ms Labbe told English speaking news webisite RFI she believed neo nazis were behind it.

A rival Facebook page was set up in answer, called 'For the closure of Adopt a Gypsy.com'. That has already received 1,207 people as members.

The public prosecutor has said it is too early to determine the next steps.

Attacked: Roma gypsies were branded 'thieves' on the Facebook page, which has now been taken down

The Facebook page is not the first time France has seen racist comments directed at the Roma population.

Last week a mayor in central France threatened to kill himself if travellers returned to his village.

And last month, centrist French deputy Gilles Bourdouleix allegedly suggested 'maybe Hitler didn’t kill enough gypsies'. He later resigned over the matter.

Bourdouleix was said to have made the comments under his breath during a meeting with travellers at a camp in the western town of Cholet, where he is mayor.

Earlier in the summer, the European Roma and Travellers Forum (ERTF) announced it would be suing Jean-Marie Le Pen, founder of the far-right National Front, for incitement to racial hatred.

The 85-year-old right-wing firebrand made comments in Nice on July 4th where he labelled the local Roma community a 'smelly' and 'rash-inducing' presence in the southern city.

The following day, the city’s mayor and centre-right UMP deputy Christian Estrosi also caused outrage by labelling the Roma community 'criminals' and proposing tougher measures for dealing with them, including installing video surveillance in Roma and traveller camps.
