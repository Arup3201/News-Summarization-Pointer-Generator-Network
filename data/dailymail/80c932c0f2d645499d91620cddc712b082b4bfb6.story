A 42-year-old man has been sentenced to the maximum 25 years to life in prison after suffocating his quadriplegic girlfriend and leaving their two-year-old son with her body for 16 hours. 

Angelo Sanchez smothered wheelchair-bound Melissa Torres, 32, with a blanket after she criticized him for 'getting high' on angel dust, or Phencyclidine (PCP), at their home in Brooklyn, New York.

He then left her body in the bathroom alongside their son Elijaah Sanchez, who was screaming and crying for his mother to 'wake up', before smashing a safe open in a search for cash.

Elijaah, now three, was found by police wearing a soiled diaper in the bathroom of the apartment in Clymer Street a staggering 16 hours later, according to the New York Post.

'He was screaming for help, putting toys back and forth in the broken safe,' Assistant District Attorney Josh Charlton told Brooklyn Supreme Court.

In a victim impact statement, Miss Torres' mother, Norma Santiago said the toddler still does not realize his mother has died; he simply believes she is sleeping.

'He says he's going to see her and runs around the house crying, "I want to see Mommy. I want to see Mommy!" He's a sweet angel,' she said.

Following the murder on August 4, 2013, Sanchez admitted via a handwritten confession that he had suffocated his girlfriend after she 'got mad' at him for going out and getting high.

In relation to his son, he wrote: 'The baby woke up and came to the bathroom and tried to sit on his mother's lap. I picked him up, the baby was asking if his mother was sleeping.' 

During the sentencing, defense attorney Martin Marshak claimed Sanchez had cared for his girlfriend for more than 15 years and had killed her in a drugged-up state.

But Judge Matthew D'Emic dismissed the claims, describing the incident as a murderous 'act of cruelty'. 

'It doesn't get much worse than that.' he added.

As he was led away by prison guards, Sanchez, who has an extensive criminal history, said he never wanted to get out of prison because his life was 'over'. 

Ms Santiago is now in the process of adopting Elijaah.
