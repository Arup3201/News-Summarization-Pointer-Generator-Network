Republican leader John Boehner was last night forced to abandon an attempt to pass a republican plan for the debt crisis through Congress after he failed to gather enough support from the right-wing of his party.

Despite lawmakers working late into the night, House Majority Whip Kevin McCarthy announced the planned vote tonight on legislation to avoid a first-ever U.S. government default will not happen.

It came as the the heads of America’s largest financial firms wrote to the White House and Congress pressuring them to reach a deal on the debt and deficit - or face ‘very grave’ economic consequences.

Tricky times: Many of the chamber's GOP freshmen who are crucial to passage of a House plan to avoid a first-ever default are climbing aboard, but House Speaker John Boehner will not be claiming victory just yet

JPMorgan’s Jamie Dimon, Goldman 
Sachs’ Lloyd Blankfein and Bank of America’s Brian Moynihan, among 
others, made their plea as politicians last night (Thurs) voted on a 
plan put forward by the Republicans.

The country officially reaches its 
legal borrowing limit on August 2, beyond which it cannot fund its huge 
debt of $14.3 trillion.

America’s top notch credit rating 
will be downgraded if it defaults on its debt next week - with 
potentially disastrous results for the world economy.

The country’s financial chiefs reiterated that an agreement between squabbling politicians needs to be reached this week.

Their letter said: ‘A default on our 
nation’s obligations, or a downgrade of America’s credit rating, would 
be a tremendous blow to business and investor confidence - raising

Earlier yesterday, the vote was 
delayed amid reports that Mr Boehner was struggling to get the votes 
needed for the debt plan to pass, even as GOP freshman important to the 
bill's passage climbed aboard.

If the House approved the bill it 
would bring President Barack Obama and congressional leaders a step 
closer to endgame efforts for a debt-limit solution before next 
Tuesday's pressing deadline.

Republicans are seeking deep spending cuts in exchange for raising the nation's $14.3trillion debt limit to allow the government to keep paying its bills.

The White House has threatened to veto the GOP bill if it makes it through the Democratic-controlled Senate.

world from the Republican budget. We're trying to save life on this 
planet as we know it today'

But getting the newly modified House plan passed on Thursday is seen as an important step towards finding a compromise - possibly in the Senate.

Meanwhile, House Minority Leader Nancy 
Pelosi today said: 'What we're trying to do is save the world from the 
Republican budget. We're trying to save life on this planet as we know 
it today.'

Rival plans by Mr Boehner and Senate Democratic leader Harry Reid have much in common, such as the creation of a congressional panel to recommend additional spending cuts this autumn.

Mr Reid has hinted a compromise could be achievable, and as debate got under way in the House, he said the Senate would vote on the GOP bill as soon as the House finished late on Thursday.

But he insisted: ‘No Democrat will vote 
for a short-term Band-Aid that would put our economy at risk and put the
nation back in this untenable situation a few short months from now.’

Senate Democratic leader Harry Reid

Earlier in the day, in a closed-door GOP meeting, Mr Boehner made headway in securing the 217 votes necessary to pass his plan. No Democrats were expected to support it.

Mr Boehner told the Republicans he expected to round up enough votes but was not there yet.

‘But today is the day,’ he reportedly said. At an early afternoon news conference, Mr Boehner said the bill wasn't perfect but was a ‘sincere and honest way to end this crisis’.

‘This bill is as large a step as we're able to take at this point in time that is doable and signable and to become law,’ he said.

Representative Kevin McCarthy, of California, who counts the votes, 
offered no numbers, simply saying they were moving in the right 
direction.

House Speaker John Boehner

The bill passed an early hurdle as 
the House voted 238-186 along party lines to move forward on the 
legislation. Some lawmakers were climbing behind it, though sometimes 
grudgingly.

‘I think it's the best deal we can get,’ said Republican Representative Steve Chabot, of Ohio, who revealed he had dropped his opposition.

Republican Representative Walter Jones, of North Carolina, said he would back the measure to ensure that Mr Boehner ‘has a seat at the table’ for the final negotiations.

The White House expected Mr Boehner to rally enough Republicans for the measure, with adviser David Plouffe saying it will ‘pass out of the House in partisan fashion.’

The House has 240 Republicans and 193 Democrats with two vacancies. Mr Boehner can only afford to lose two dozen members.

Wall Street warily watched the bitter standoff in Washington D.C. as stocks rose modestly on Thursday, based in part on a strong jobs report - after a poor day’s trading on Wednesday.

But only the Nasdaq finished up, with the Dow Jones and S&P 500 both closing slightly down.

House Republicans tweaked their measure on Wednesday to enhance its prospects of passage after a worse-than expected cost estimate from congressional budget analysts on Tuesday.

The changes were modest, but they brought projected savings for 2012 to $22billion, part of a 10-year cut of $917billion. That would trigger a $900 billion increase in the debt limit.

Mr Boehner showed fire in a meeting on Wednesday with the Republican caucus, saying: ‘Get your ass in line. I can't do this job unless you're behind me.’
