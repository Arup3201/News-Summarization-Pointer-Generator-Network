An Oscar-winning screenwriter strangled a young actress with his belt during sadistic sex, she claims in a $5million lawsuit filed yesterday.

Amanda Jencsik, 26, says she feared for her life during an abusive four-month relationship with Moonstruck writer John Patrick Shanley, who is 35 years her senior.

Miss Jencsik alleges the 61-year-old would slap her and hold his hands over her mouth and neck during their encounters at his Manhattan apartment.

The writer often asked her if she felt like he was raping her, the suit says.

She claims their rough sex sessions were so violent that she believed Mr Shanley was trying to kill her, and says she grew light-headed when he wrapped the belt around her neck.

Brooklyn-born Miss Jencsik says she suffered severe physical and psychological trauma at the hands of the older man - but did not report him to the police 'due to her mental state', the New York Post reports.

Sal Strazzullo, the lawyer 
representing Miss Jencsik, said Mr Shanley had a 'Svengali-like effect' 
on the aspiring actress, which kept her from severing ties.

Mr Shanley, who wrote the 1987 Cher 
film and also adapted the plane crash survival drama Alive in 1993, said
 he knew nothing of the lawsuit when it was filed yesterday.

Miss
 Jencsik's statement says the pair met via Facebook in October 2009, 
with Mr Shanley striking up the correspondence by asking her about her 
hair colour.

They did not meet in person until a dinner date in January 2010, she claims.

The 26-year-old alleges that, after a second date later that month, she followed Mr Shanley to his apartment and they had sex.

He invited her back the next day but was not home when she arrived, the suit says.

When he eventually showed up he was drunk, Miss Jencsik alleges, and once inside he 'forcibly turned [her] over onto her stomach' and sodomised her.

Though she told Mr Shanley he was hurting her he laughed, the suit says, and afterwards he complained that his sheets had been left stained with her blood and makeup.

The third and final time they had sex, she says, Mr Shanley sodomised her again - this time looping the belt around her throat.

After she split up with him in April 2010, Miss Jencsik claims, she was in pain but too scared to seek medical help. The lawsuit adds that it took her a whole year to approach a doctor, who diagnosed her with a bowel obstruction.
