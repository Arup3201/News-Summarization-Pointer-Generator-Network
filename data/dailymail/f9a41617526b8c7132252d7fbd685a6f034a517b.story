'Law & Order SVU' is tackling racial profiling head on in an upcoming episode that winds together the controversial Trayvon Martin case and the Paula Deen scandal.

In the episode, Cybill Shepard plays Jolene Castille, a famous southern chef. But instead of making a racial slur, like Deen, she guns down an unarmed, hoodie-wearing black teen she thought was following her on the Upper West Side, mirroring the Trayvon Martin slaying.

According to TV Guide, Castille claims she killed the teen in an act of self-defense because she knew police were chasing a rapist of the same description.

The episode, which also stars Jeffery Tambor and Leslie Odom, Jr., will air in October.

On Wednesday, pictures emerged from the SVU set, sparking rumours the show was taking on the George Zimmerman trial.

And Executive Producer Warren Leight confirmed it to Entertainment Weekly.

'(Jeffrey) Tambor is a defense attorney representing a very high-profile celebrity woman chef who thought she was being pursued by a rapist and turned around it was a teenager. And she shot him,' he said.

Odom will play a minister of the slain child.

Leight told the magazine the episode will also deal with New York's stop-and-frisk policy.

He said the show would ask the tough questions.

'Is racial profiling justifiable? Can self-defense involve racial profiling? We're diving right into that,' he said. 'Can that happen in New York? Absolutely.'

The NBC sex-crimes drama is known for ripping plot lines straight from the headlines.

Last season, an episode depicted a violent love affair between two pop stars in a story that uncannily resembled Rihanna and Chris Brown's abusive relationship.

Leight said this season will feature more real crimes than usual because 'it's almost like we've been bombarded with headlines.'

He added that the Zimmerman trial, reflected in the script, was so polarising it even divided the SVU team.

'When the script was published it became a litmus test for everybody here,' he said. 'It was really interesting to see people read that script and have different interpretations about who did what and whether or not they deserved prison for it. It was fascinating.'
