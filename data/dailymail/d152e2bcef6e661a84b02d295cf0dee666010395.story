Chinese women are going under the knife to obtain a nose with a sweeping curve like the one seen on the Eiffel Tower

Just when you thought there could be no more bizarre trends left in plastic surgery, young people in China are going under the knife to have their noses reshaped... like the Eiffel Tower.

Apparently driven by the incredible levels of competition in the Chinese job market, young students and graduates believe that a curved, Western style nose will give them that je ne sais quoi needed to secure a career.

Hundreds of advertisements are currently displayed across the south-western city of Chongqing, with posters promoting surgeon Wang Xuming's 'Eiffel Tower' procedure, AFP reports.

The poster shows a pale Western-looking woman showing off her slender, sloping nose in profile against a silhouette of the famous French landmark.

Despite the 7,400 euro (about £6,100) cost of the operation - and the rather unpalatable fact that the nose is made larger using tissue from the forehead - demand is apparently high.

Surgeon Wang Xuming said of his procedure: 'We are influenced by the beauty of Eiffel Tower, we are not content to just add something to the nose, we reconstruct it.

'Some students face a lot of employment pressure after graduation, if their facial features are good, they'll have more chance of finding a job.

‘We've had students getting the Eiffel Towernose, it's helped them a lot.'

Official statistics show that more students than ever graduated in 2013, with over seven million spilling out into the job market which has been hit by the recent economic downturn.

More graduates and fewer jobs means that up to 10 per cent of those with degrees are unemployed, and employers feel able to be extremely discerning when selecting new staff, with some job adverts specifying certain physical characteristics an applicant must have, such as a minimum height.

The popularity of surgery in Asia, particularly among the young, has been blamed by some on a desire to look more 'western' fuelled by an obsession with celebrity culture.

South Korea is the world's largest market for plastic surgery, with one in five Seoul women having gone under the knife.

Recently a procedure similar in its extreme nature to the ‘Eiffel Tower nose’ has hit headlines when an unnamed woman, allegedly a reporter on a South Korean TV channel, underwent jaw surgery in order to achieve the dainty heart-shaped face desired by many east Asian women.

It is usually a last resort solution to correct facial deformities where people have been unable to chew properly due to an excessive over or underbite, but has become popular in South Korea.

Other worrying trends have seen leg lengthening and eye-widening procedures sweep some Asian countries as a Western look is continued to be highly prized.
