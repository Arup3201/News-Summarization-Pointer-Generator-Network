A British Airways flight to Dubai was forced to return to London Heathrow Airport this afternoon after the jumbo jet’s undercarriage wheels failed to fully retract following take-off.

Witnesses on the ground near Biggin Hill in south-east London reported hearing a ‘loud bang’ as the Boeing 747-400, carrying 274 passengers and 16 crew, flew overhead shortly after 1pm.

For more than 30 minutes, the plane circled with its wheels down over south-east London and Kent and it dumped fuel before it was cleared to land at Heathrow.

Tony Southgate says he heard a 'loud bang' as the British Airways plane flew overhead

A BA spokesperson told MailOnline Travel that the flight crew did not declare an emergency and the plane landed without incident despite the issue with its wheels.

The spokesperson said: ‘The pilot couldn’t retract the undercarriage take-off, and decided to return to Heathrow to get the problem fixed sooner rather later.

‘The aircraft landed safely back at Heathrow after a technical problem.

‘We're sorry for the delay to our customers’ journey who will soon be on another aircraft and on their way to Dubai.’ 

A spokeswoman said the pilot consulted engineers while the plane was in the air and they instructed him to turn around.

The spokeswoman said passengers and crew were 'happy and relaxed' following the incident.

Witness Tony Southgate said he was at home near Biggin Hill when he heard a loud bang.

He told MailOnline Travel: ‘I heard this low rumbling boom and my dog jumped up and I looked outside the windows.

‘I saw this plane that was leaving (London) turn around and circle back.

‘The two could be completely unrelated but a few of my neighbours heard it as well.’

Mr Southgate managed to snap a photo of the plane as it flew overhead in a holding pattern.

He said: ‘It was very unusual because when they circle normally the wheels are up.

‘It seemed to be flying perfectly normal. It was a bit lower than they normally are in the loop, but it seemed to be perfectly fine.’

Tony Southgate said he heard a 'big bang' before he spotted the plane circling with its wheels down

Plane spotter Nicholas Hair, who lives in Bexleyheath, south-east London, said: ‘I saw the plane circling with the landing gear down six times over Sevenoaks which is not meant to happen.

‘I was nine miles away from Sevenoaks, but I heard the bang at 1.40pm.

‘I was quite a distance away and the noise was a bit quieter, but for people in Sevenoaks it would have been a lot louder.’ 

He claims the aircraft involved is one of the oldest in BA’s fleet, having entered service 24 years ago, and is due to be retired as new aircraft are introduced.

He added: ‘It is an obvious case that anything mechanical becomes less reliable over time and in the wake of the Clacton and Double Riyadh incident it is causing concern among British Airways passengers, myself being one of them, and I now actively avoid flying on those aircraft.'

Mr Hair claimed the incident is not the first occasion that British Airways has suffered technical difficulties with its jumbo jets.

He said: 'This is the fourth 747 to have a significant problem with the landing gear or wing flaps in the last 12 to 15 months and it seems to be British Airways only.'

Passenger Richard King sent a tweet expressing his frustration over the delay

Passenger James Dempsey informed his followers that the plane experienced a landing gear problem

The BA spokesperson said the crew didn't hear a bang while the plane was in the air, adding: 'Trying to retract wheels doesn’t cause any kind of bang noise.'

Mr Hair, who works for a railway company, believes the crew failed to hear the bang because of insulation on board.

He said: 'Inside insulation would mean that people on board would not be able to hear the loud bang or it would seem quieter, like a completely different noise.'

The BA spokesperson confirmed that the plane dumped fuel before landing, which is standard procedure in such a situation.

Flight BA107 was met by emergency crews when it returned to Terminal 5, and some of its passengers vented their frustration on Twitter.

Passenger Richard King tweeted: ‘Just took off from Heathrow for Dubai but landing gear issues so dumping fuel mid-air and returning with emergency crews on standby.’

Another passenger, James Dempsey, tweeted: ‘Just had a lovely 1hr flight from Heathrow to Heathrow on board the new style BA 747-400 with fixed landing gear.’

The Civil Aviation Authority is awaiting information from British Airways about the incident.

A Heathrow Airport spokesman said: 'We have response procedures for situations like this and our crews on the ground would have been alerted.

'British Airways would have contacted air traffic control about the problem and that is a separate agency.

'The passengers would be sent back into the terminal buildings once it landed so our involvement would have been pretty limited.

'We have safety procedures in place and we're able to respond to things should they develop, but I don't think that was the case in this instance.'
