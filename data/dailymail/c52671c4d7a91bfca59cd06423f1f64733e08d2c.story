Internet troll Sam Busby leaving Worcester Magistrates Court

A teenage troll who made a series of depraved sexual comments about five-year-old April Jones on Facebook has been handed a suspended prison sentence.

Sam Busby, 18, walked free from court despite being told that another Facebook user was locked up for three months for an 'almost identical' offence committed last month.

Instead, he received a six-week jail term suspended for 18 months.

Busby, a call centre worker from St John's, Worcester, was arrested by police after posting grossly offensive remarks on the social networking site on the day a man was charged with April's murder - just five days after her disappearance in Machynlleth, mid-Wales.

He pleaded guilty last week to a 
charge of sending an indecent and offensive message brought under the 
2003 Communications Act.

During the case, Worcester Magistrates Court heard he posted on his page: 'All these April Jones jokes are getting old, unlike her.'

When challenged by another user, who said his comments were 'too soon', he responded with a tirade of vile remarks about April.

Prosecutor Kerry Lovegrove told the court Busby's initial post on Facebook was a 'joke' about April obtained from another website.

His inappropriate comments prompted one woman who has two young daughters to contact West Mercia Police.

Ms Lovegrove said: 'She felt so shocked and sickened that she reported the matter to the police.

'She states that she was distressed by the comments as she herself has two young girls.

'The defendant was later interviewed where he admitted posting the joke. He admitted that he had further put the offensive comments.

'He told police he was an immature teenager and it was an attempt to get attention.'

Busby also told officers he thought they could only be seen by his friends on Facebook.

Belinda Arris, mitigating, said Busby was now likely to lose his job and was 
extremely sorry and ashamed.

She said: 'He is 18-years-old.

'He lives with his mother, his stepfather and two brothers.

'They are at court today but he is so ashamed of what he has done he’s asked them to stay outside the court room.

'His parents and brothers don’t know what he posted on Facebook but they know it must be bad.

'When he posted the initial joke it was a joke he had found elsewhere on a joke website and momentarily he thought it was funny.

'He is extremely immature. Anybody with any sense of maturity would have left it at that. Stupidly he didn’t, he continued the responses. 

'He’s extremely sorry, he’s extremely ashamed. He can’t believe the extra stress he would have caused the family of April Jones.'

Passing the sentence, magistrates said they had
taken into account Busby's early guilty plea and remorse.

After
retiring to consider the appropriate sentence for more than 40 minutes,
chairman of the bench Gill Porter told the teenager: 'You will realise 
by the time we have taken to discuss this matter how seriously we view 
it.

'You have caused an 
immense amount of distress - not only to the recipient of this - but 
potentially to April Jones' family and friends.

'It
happened at a very sensitive time for everybody concerned - you were 
warned by your friends when they first saw your so-called joke, but you 
took no notice and you continued to make further even more offensive 
comments.'

Busby, who has no previous convictions and works full time as an inbound sales advisor for Serco BPO, was also ordered to pay an £80 victim 
surcharge and keep to a 7pm-7am curfew for eight weeks.

He refused
to comment outside court.

April's body has never been found despite extensive searches.
