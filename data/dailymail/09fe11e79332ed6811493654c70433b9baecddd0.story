When Zachary Huxtable was born last week his parents were expecting a bundle of joy - but perhaps not such a large one.

For the baby boy tips the scales at 13lb 11oz - making him one of the biggest babies to be born in Britain. 

The five-day-old is more than twice the average weight of a newborn baby and is wearing clothes that would normally fit a 6-9 month old.

Big boy: Zachary Huxtable held by his mother Rosie Hall. He was born at Birmingham Women's Hospital

His mother Rosie Hall delivered him naturally with only a little gas and air at the end of her nine-hour delivery last Thursday at Birmingham Women's Hospital.

Midwives at the hospital were so surprised by his size they weighed him twice. 

His proud dad Matthew Huxtable, 19, said: 'He was off the scale on all of the scans so we knew he was going to be big but we didn't think he would be that big.

'He is wearing clothes for a six to nine-month old. We had to go a buy a load of emergency clothes because all the ones we had didn't fit.'

Rosie is no stranger to big babies after she gave birth to the couple's first child, 14-month-old Ellie, who weighed in at 10lb 9oz.

The mother went into labour around 9am last Thursday and gave birth at 6.17pm the same day. They are both still recovering in hospital but are due to return home to their home in Smethwick tomorrow.

'We are extremely relieved Zachary is okay and healthy,' she said. 'It's wonderful.'

Father Matthew, a mechanic, added: 'He is absolutely huge, the other babies look dinky compared to him.' 

What a whopper: Zachary is nearly twice as heavy as the average newborn boy

Proud Grandmother Katherine Huxtable, from Bearwood, West Midlands, said big babies ran in the family.

'One of the nurses at the hospital said she had never seen a baby as big in her life,' she said.

'He is absolutely beautiful. He is a wonderful child. He is going to need a reinforced pram.'

She continued: 'We are quite a big family, Matthew and Rose are both 6ft and Matthew was 10lb and Rosie was over 9lb.'

Full time mother Rosie didn't want pain relief after suffering with her back following an epidural when she had Ellie.

Katherine added: 'She was a soldier. She soldiered right the way through. She was in quite a bit of pain but she was really good. She had child bearing hips.'

Zachary follows in the large footsteps of Jack Herman who was born in 2007 in Manchester weighing 14lb 8oz.

The biggest baby born in the UK is believed to be Guy Carr who was delivered in Cumbria in 1992 weighing 15lb 8oz. The biggest British baby girl was Libby Woods, who was born in March this year weighing 12lbs 8oz.
