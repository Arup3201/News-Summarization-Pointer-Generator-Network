Police in California are searching for a man caught on security camera footage crashing a wedding and making off with $1,000 in gift cards, checks and cash left for the bride and groom.

Surveillance picked up the suspect entering the clubhouse of the Tustin Ranch Golf Course in Orange County on Saturday while the wedding party was in full swing.

The suspect grabbed a box containing the gifts left for the newlyweds, covered it with his jacket and walked out, while the guests were none-the-wiser.

Tustin Police Department posted a description of the suspect and the footage onto Facebook and appealed for help.

Suspect: This man allegedly used his jacket to hide the box he stole from the wedding

The police department wrote 'The suspect is described as a male/middle eastern / 25 - 35 years of age / 5'09"-5'11" tall.'

The man also allegedly 'was wearing a black suit with a grey shirt,' the department wrote.

Lt. Robert Wright told CBS Los Angeles 'A suspect approached a table, which had a number of gifts on it. One of those gifts was a box that contained gift cards, cash, and checks.' 

Wright explained to the affiliate station that 'The suspect removed his jacket, concealed that box, and then walked out of that facility hiding that box and fled the scene.'

The affiliate station reported that it's believed $1,000 was taken.  

'We have confirmed that the suspect was not a member of the wedding party or guest at the wedding, and the golf course has been cooperating with us and he is not an employee of the golf course either,' Wright also said.

'Now the bride and groom did continue on, and are currently honeymooning,' Wright told ABC News.

The police department wrote 'The suspect is described as a male/middle eastern / 25 - 35 years of age / 5'09"-5'11" tall'
