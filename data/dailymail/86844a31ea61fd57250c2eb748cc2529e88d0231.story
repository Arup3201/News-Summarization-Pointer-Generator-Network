A Philadelphia radio station has released an excruciating, never-before-seen clip of the moment Chris Christie slipped from a chair in its studio.

The New Jersey governor was trying to sit down at SportsRadio 94WIP last June when he promptly fell from the chair, in a scene right out of a slapstick comedy.

With a look of horror on his face, Christie lands with a bump.

'We've got a chair issue!' host Angelo Cataldi can be heard saying as crew members rush over to the portly politician.

In the footage, Christie looks shocked - especially once he notices the camera - but manages to get on his feet as he says: 'We're alright now.'

Ouch: The stunned politician falls to the ground as the chair gets away from him

The footage, which was taken ahead of the station's interview with Christie last June, was released during the station's Wing Bowl on Friday after they added a comedy soundtrack to the slip-up.

Cataldi, who lives in New Jersey, had been shocked when Christie was seen cheering for the Dallas Cowboys from owner Jerry Jones' box - and pressed him about it on the show.

Christie famously follows the Cowboys despite his team having a long-standing rivalry with the New York Giants in his own state because they play in the same NFL conference every year.

Christie told Cataldi he always knew he would take heat for being a Cowboys fan, but did not deny it when he was asked about it when he first ran for governor.

The day after he revealed his allegiance, Jones called him to say, 'Buddy, I'm so proud,' he said.

Christie was also filmed hugging Jones and his son Stephen after Dallas defeated the Detroit Lions in a game earlier this month.

The radio station shared the footage on Friday as questions remain over whether the governor will make a 2016 bid for the White House. Earlier this week, he started his fundraising effort by filing paperwork to form a political action committee.

The politician has long been named as a potential contender for the Republican seat, and among the speculation are questions over whether he has lost weight to get in shape for the bid. 

In November, a leading weight loss doctor estimated that the Christie has lost at least 100 pounds since undergoing gastric band surgery in February 2013.

Despite having visibly slimmed down since undergoing the surgery, Christie has to date refused to put a figure on his weight loss. 

Christie has struggled with his weight for years and said he decided to have the Lap-band surgery for his 'long-term health' and for the sake of his family.
