A woman from Alabama has been accused of running her husband over several times with a car after an argument.

Angela Reynolds, 40, is charged with first-degree domestic violence.

Her husband, 44-year-old John Reynolds, was found at the bottom of a friend's driveway suffering from serious but non-life threatening injuries. 

Jailed: Angela Reynolds, 40, is facing domestic violence charges after investigators say she hit her husband several times with a vehicle Saturday night

Found: John Reynolds, 44, was found writhing in agony at the end of his friends driveway after his wife had driven over him

'She was upset with him for being intoxicated,' Tallassee Police told WSFA. 

The couple had been arguing at a house when the wife used her vehicle to run over her husband several times.

A neighbor told WSFA that they were constantly having arguments.

Mr Reynolds was found at the edge of his friend's driveway on Saturday night by neighbors who were alerted by the commotion, however it was not clear what had happened.

The Tallassee Police Department says Angela Reynolds, 40, now faces a first degree domestic violence charge

'She was upset with him for being intoxicated,' said Tallassee Police Department Investigator Jason Gray said.

'There was alcohol involved and that was the only thing we can find that prompted this. Unfortunately domestic violence is the highest percentage of our call volume.'

Mr Reynolds remains in the hospital in stable condition while his wife is being held at the Tallapoosa County Jail.
