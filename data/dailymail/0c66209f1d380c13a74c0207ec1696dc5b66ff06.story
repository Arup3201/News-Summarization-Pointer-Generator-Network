Amazon moved closer to stepping out of cyberspace after signing a lease for space across from the Empire State Building that could be the location for a planned brick-and-mortar storefront.

It was reported back in October that the online retail corporation was looking to open a physical store in New York City.

On Thursday, Vornado Realty Trust issued a press release  stating that Amazon had inked a 17-year lease on a 470,000 square-foot space near Herald Square.

The 12-story building is currently home to storefronts for clothing brands Express and Mango.

'We have leased this building primarily as corporate office space and we intend to sublease to other tenants the ground floor retail space,' Amazon spokesperson Kelly Cheeseman told the Huffington Post in an email. 

Amazon did not respond to questions about whether it planned to use the space for its own retail store.

The Wall Street Journal revealed back in October that the company was quietly planning to experiment with a physical storefront in Manhattan.

Speaking with unnamed sources, the Journal reported the planned location would hold a limited inventory and be more like a warehouse than a traditional retail space.

Customers would be able to pick up and return items purchased online, and the location would serve as a distribution center for couriers, according to sources familiar with the plan.

Still, at least one person that spoke to the paper stated that plans could change for the Internet retail giant. 

Amazon has already tried to bring its brand to consumers in the real world through a mobile retail truck.

The food truck-style store sells e-readers and tablets, along with Amazon Fire TV, and has been spotted in Brooklyn and Manhattan as well as Santa Monica.
