A deadline for signing up to Barack Obama's trouble-hit health insurance reforms without penalties will be postponed by six weeks, the White House has said.

Officials confirmed that enrollment requirements were being changed so that 
consumers could register for health insurance right up to the March 31 
deadline.

As it stands, some people previously needed to be signed up by February 15 to ensure their insurance cover took effect in time to avoid sanctions.

On the defensive: The Obama administration is looking to extend the cut-off for signing up for health insurance without penalties after criticism about glitches with the website and confusion over deadlines

Glitch: Even some Democrats have been calling for a delay to the March 31 deadline because of problems surrounding the HealthCare.gov website (above) where consumers can shop and sign up for insurance

A
 White House official said that pushing back the sign-up requirement was
 not related to glitches with Healthcare.gov, but was simply an effort 
to eliminate a 'disconnect' over the two deadlines.

But the move will fall short for even some in Obama's own party, who are calling for the March 31 deadline to be extended by up to a year because of the chaos surrounding the website.

Democrats had hoped to run for re-election next year on the benefits of the health care law for millions of uninsured Americans.

Instead, computer problems are keeping many consumers from signing up through new online markets.

One House Democrat, Rick Nolan, said the president needs to 'man up' and fire somebody.

A prolonged delay in getting 
Healthcare.gov to work could jeopardise White House efforts to sign up 
as many as 7 million people in 2014, the first full year the law takes 
effect.

If the enrollment period is extended, as some Democrats are calling for, it would cause serious issues for the insurance companies.

They have set their premiums based on the attractive notion that millions of healthy young people would be inclined to register to avoid penalties.

One insurance industry insider told CPR that if the rules are changed 'insurers are going to want to change their premiums' because fewer fit people would sign up.

Firms also need to plan their premiums for the following year based on who's already signed up, so any delay would hamper their ability to do that.

Democrat Senator Joe Manchin of 
West Virginia, said he would join a Republican effort to delay the 
so-called 'individual mandate,' that requires people to buy insurance or
 face a tax penalty.

Manchin, in a Fox News interview on the 'The O'Reilly Factor,' called for a transition year with no fines.

'Let's
 work through the problems. We've got a lot of problems, they have been 
identified. I think everybody has recognized them. Let's fix it. Let's 
get together and fix things,' he said.

The comments from the handful of 
Democrats posed a new potential hazard for the White House and gave 
Republicans a chance to portray their efforts to derail the healthcare 
program as bipartisan.

Democratic
 Senator Mark Pryor of Arkansas, who faces a tough re-election race next
 year, said he agreed with fellow Democrat Jeanne Shaheen of New 
Hampshire that the open enrollment period to sign up for insurance 
should be extended beyond March 31, 2014.

Representative
 James Clyburn of South Carolina, the third-ranking House Democrat, 
criticized the website for forcing consumers to provide private 
information before deciding what kind of health insurance plan they want
 to buy.

'I've talked to too
 many people who tell me before they ever get around to figuring out 
what it is they want to buy, they're having to answer questions that 
they don't feel they should be answering,' Clyburn said.

Administration officials, in damage-control mode for nearly a week, held a closed-door briefing for Democrats in the U.S. House of Representatives and a private session with insurance company executives, who said they would assist in efforts to fix the Healthcare.gov website.

Websites are the primary vehicle for consumers to shop for insurance through exchanges set up under the healthcare program.

Holding Obama to account: House of Representatives Speaker John Boehner tells reporters that Republicans would intensify their investigations into the launch of the 2010 Affordable Care Act

The contractors for the
 government's troubled healthcare website sought to deflect blame on 
Wednesday as more Democrats voiced concerns about the implementation of 
President Barack Obama's signature domestic policy.

Meanwhile, Republicans said they would intensify their investigations into the launch of the 2010 Affordable Care Act, known as 'Obamacare.'

'It is our job to hold them accountable, and when it comes to Obamacare clearly there is a lot to hold accountable,' House of Representatives Speaker John Boehner told reporters.

The Republican-led House Energy and Commerce Committee will hear today from the top contractors responsible for the program.

They included website developer CGI Federal, a unit of Canada's CGI Group Inc, which said in prepared testimony that the software from another contractor designed to allow users to create an account led to early bottlenecks.

But the other contractor, United Health Group unit Quality Software Services Inc (QSSI), said in prepared testimony that some of its problems stemmed from a late decision by the administration to require consumers to register for an account before browsing for insurance products.

'This may have driven higher simultaneous usage of the registration system that wouldn't have occurred if consumers could 'window shop' anonymously,' said QSSI.

Under Obamacare laws, Americans are meant to have insurance coverage from January 1, 2014.

But there is a 90-day grace period which gives consumers until the end of March.

However, for coverage to take effect in time, you have to enroll by the middle of the month before - so, in this case, around February 15.

White House spokesman Jay Carney signalled that changes would be made to tackle this confusing 'disconnect'.

The company's software is now keeping pace with demand. Andrew Slavitt, executive vice president with QSSI's parent, said the software has had 'error rates close to zero' since Oct. 8.

Obama administration officials, including U.S. Health and Human Services Secretary Kathleen Sebelius, met with the chief executives of 14 leading insurance companies, including Aetna Inc, WellPoint Inc and Humana Inc.

The executives agreed to form new technical teams with the administration to help fix the website, which provide online access to the marketplaces designed to be the main way for millions of uninsured Americans to research and buy health insurance plans under the law.

'We had a candid discussion on the challenges facing the exchange, and the plan that is being put in place to get the program on track,' Aetna Inc spokeswoman Cynthia Michener said.

The October 1 debut of the exchanges was marred by technical glitches that have kept many from signing on and making purchases. Those unable to sign up online can call a toll-free telephone number as an alternative.

The administration has so far declined to disclose the number of enrollments, either online or by telephone.

A delay in getting 
Healthcare.gov to work could mean 
as many as 7 million people might not getÂ  signed up in 2014, the first full year the law takes 
effect.

The 
administration this week began what it called a 'tech surge,' bringing 
in experts led by the administration's top economic aide Jeffrey Zients 
to analyze and fix the problems.

'I
 think what we learned is they're working hard to fix the problems,' 
Representative Sander Levin of Michigan, senior Democrat on the House 
Ways and Means Committee, said after Wednesday's briefing.

The U.S. Health and Human Services Department will begin regular news briefings today to provide updates on 'the progress that's being made and on the efforts that are being undertaken, both to address the technical problems and to make the whole experience for American consumers better,' White House spokesman Jay Carney said.

House Democrats said there was no discussion in the briefing about whether the problems should lead to a delay of the individual requirement that every American have insurance or pay a tax penalty.

The Congressional Budget Office has estimated a delay would reduce enrollment significantly.

Republicans, who have fought the healthcare law as an unwarranted extension of the federal government, said the requirement should be delayed until the problems with the roll-out are resolved.

'With so many unanswered questions and the problems arising around this roll-out, it doesn't make any sense to impose this one percent mandate tax on the American people,' House Majority Leader Eric Cantor told reporters yesterday.

Republicans have repeatedly tried to derail or delay the healthcare law since taking control of the House in the 2010 elections. They demanded more answers on Wednesday about the scope of the problems.

Three committees in the Republican-controlled House have announced investigations of the law's rollout, which Cantor described as 'nothing short of a debacle.'
