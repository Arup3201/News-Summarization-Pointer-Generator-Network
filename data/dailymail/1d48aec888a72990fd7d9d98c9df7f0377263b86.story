Boiling water attack: A teenage boy poured boiling water over a schoolgirl's face after she un-friended him on Facebook just weeks before

A schoolgirl has suffered severe burns after an older boy poured boiling water over her face because she un-friended him on Facebook.

The boy broke into the teenage girl’s house and locked her and her mother in a room before attacking the girl with a pot of boiling water in the city of Muzaffarpur in northern Bihar, India yesterday.

Just weeks before the attack the girl had un-friended him on the social networking site because he starting posting strange comments on her Facebook wall.

While he held the mother and daughter captive, he boiled some water in the kitchen then proceeded to pour it over the girl’s face.

Police have now begun a manhunt for the boy, an intermediate student, who fled the scene.

The pair became friends on Facebook about a year ago until early December when he started acting weirdly toward her on social media.

The victim, an Indian class eight student, was taken to a local hospital for treatment.

In another case of Facebook stalking, earlier this month handyman Jonathon Swift, 32, had his prison sentence for stalking his ex-girlfriend extended after he threatened to kill her in front of a judge.

Swift, from Longton in Stoke-on-Trent, subjected Carrie-Ann Lockett, 29, to an eight-month campaign of harassment which saw him steal her clothes and set them on fire, send her hundreds of texts and log onto her Facebook account to look through her messages.

The pair had been friends who met at school and struck up a relationship in February last year after they got back in touch through Facebook.
