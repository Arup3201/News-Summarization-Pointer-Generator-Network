Deceit: Rosie Dodd was jailed for two years for crying rape because she regretted having sex with three men at a drunken orgy

A woman who cried rape because she regretted having sex with three men at a drunken orgy has been jailed for two years for her ‘wicked’ lies.

Rosie Dodd, 20, had been out drinking when she met the men, aged 25, 23, and 21, and started groping one of them on a bus on the way home.

She had sex with them one after the other, but after telling a friend she felt ‘dirty’ she lied to police that she had been raped.

The men, two of them students, then suffered a ‘nightmare’ involving intimate examinations and being locked up in cells.

But after police became  concerned about inconsistencies in Dodd’s account, she admitted the encounters had been consensual.

Last night she was put behind bars. On a social networking website, she has left displayed numerous photographs of herself with a string of men, apparently taken as trophies of her conquests.

Jailing Dodd at Nottingham crown court, Judge John Milmo told her: ‘None of these three lads had seen the inside of a police station before.

‘They may well have been wrongly convicted if these charges had gone to trial. It was ten days before police managed to talk to you – and you admitted your allegations had been completely untrue. I am told, from your perspective, it was easier to tell lies rather than tell the truth.

‘I have no idea why you decided to make these wicked allegations.’

Dodd went out drinking in Nottingham city centre in June, downing eight vodkas and ending up in a casino.

There she met one of her numerous ex-boyfriends and through him met the trio.

She and the three men took a bus to a house in the Clifton area of the city, and  during the journey she began groping one of them.

In the house she willingly had sex with all three.

But afterwards she texted a friend saying that she felt ‘dirty’. With that in mind she claimed to police that all three of her partners had raped her.

Deceit: Dodd met the three men on a night out in Nottingham but regretted bedding them all

Angry: Police have warned anybody who lies in the same way Dodd did will be found out

The men, who have not been named, were
 arrested on suspicion of rape and spent a total of 50 hours in custody 
before being released on bail.

After further enquiries police grew 
suspicious and, when challenged, Dodd admitted she had consensual sex 
with the men and made up the claims because she felt regret at sleeping 
with them.

But police said Dodd, of Nottingham, who is listed as in a relationship on a social media site, showed no remorse.

She was charged with perverting the course of justice and pleaded guilty at a previous hearing.

The court heard that one of her 
victims had recently graduated from university – but what should have 
been a time for celebration became a ‘nightmare’.

Another victim, who was  also a 
student, said a medical investigation he was forced to go through was 
‘awful’, and told of his embarrassment at having to detail the 
consensual sex he had had.

One of the men said he feared his 
plans to work with children in America would be wrecked by the episode, 
although police claimed any trace of the investigation would be wiped 
from their files. None of the men had any criminal record.

Hearing: Rosie Dodd admitted she had made up the rape claims because she regretted having consensual sex with the trio, Nottingham Crown Court was told today

Detective Constable Gina Farrell, who 
led the investigation, said: ‘We take every report of rape and sexual 
assault extremely seriously.

‘But it soon became apparent that there were inconsistencies with Dodd’s account.

‘The three men accused of rape were 
quite badly affected by the damaging accusations and Dodd has never 
shown an ounce of remorse for what she put them through.

‘The time our specially-trained officers spent with her could have been spent with someone who really needed our help.’

Detective Inspector Stephen Waldram, 
head of the city Rape Investigation Team, said: ‘I would remind anyone 
considering making a false report to think again.

‘We carry out extremely thorough and in-depth investigations and their lies will be exposed.’
