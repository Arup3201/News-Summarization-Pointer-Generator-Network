Alastair Cook has said it would be wrong to quit as captain in the middle of England's series against India - despite leading his side to yet another defeat at Lord's.

Senior player Matt Prior stood down on Monday night from the team for the summer to have Achilles surgery.

But Cook insisted he is still the right man to lead his country after England collapsed horribly on the final afternoon of the second Test to crash to a 95-run defeat and gift India only their sixth win in this country in 82 years.

Pressure: Alastair Cook is under significant scrutiny as England captain

Scrutiny: The duo of Alastair Cook and coach Peter Moores have really struggled so far this summer

'I'm as determined as I was at the beginning of this game,' he said. 'Five days is a long time in sport and I'm still here. I still want to throw it all in to be captain. I've still got the determination. If we win and I score runs, things do change.

'When I was made captain I said to my wife I was going to give it my all. The team needs me to lead them through this tough time but not if it gets to the stage where I am not scoring runs by the end of the series. To quit now would be wrong.'

Wicket-keeper Prior revealed: 'I'm not doing justice to myself and more importantly the team and that is what matters first and foremost. I tore my quad before the first Test and my right hand has been beaten to a pulp, but the main issue is the Achilles. I've always said as long as I can do my job I will manage the pain and get on with it, but it has now got to the point where I can't do my job to the level I expect of myself.'

Issues at the crease: And his batting form has suffered badly as well in recent times

Dip: He is without a century now in 27 innings, and is averaging just 14 this year

England have lost seven and won none of their last 10 Tests - their 
worst sequence in over two decades - while Cook is without a century in 
27 innings and averaging 14 this year.

To compound a miserable day 
for the captain, axed batsman Kevin Pietersen once again declared his 
desire to make an international comeback and claimed his presence might 
have helped England.

In an interview with BT Sport, Pietersen said: 'I'd
 love to play for England again but we might just have to wait for a few
 things to change before that could happen.

'What I could bring is helping those youngsters play a brand of cricket that would develop their games.' 

Cook
 stood up for coach Peter Moores, who is in danger of losing his sixth 
Test series of nine, saying: 'You can't click your fingers and change 
things overnight.'
