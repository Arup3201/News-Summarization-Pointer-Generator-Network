The White House has said from the beginning of Ebola Response Coordinator Ron Klain's temporary appointment that it's not his job to be the face of the administration's efforts to stop an Ebola epidemic from breaking out on America's shores.

Rather, the president's spokesman has said, Klain's position is a managerial one, and his sole responsibility is 'coordinating the whole-of-government approach.'

'He has performed very well in that task,' press secretary Josh Earnest said today. The fruits of his labor are 'already being felt, at the White House and across the government,' the Obama flak added.

But since accepting the job 11 days ago, it's unclear from the outside looking in what it is that Klain has brought to the proverbial table. So far, the government's 'coordination' with Ebola affected states appears to be just as ham-handed as it was before Klain came on, reporters noted at yesterday's press briefing.

The federal government's chaotic approach to managing the health crisis has not eroded the public's belief that the government will successfully keep an Ebola outbreak at bay, but a CNN poll released this morning shows that many Americans do not think it is doing a 'good job.'

'It’s a theater of the absurd. It’s laughable,' Dr. Robert Murphy, a professor of medicine and biomedical engineering and director of the Center for Global Health at Northwestern University, told the New York Daily News.

Murphy, who the NY Daily News characterized as having 'much experience' in Africa, said the invisibility of Klain plus the nuances of the health care system had created confusion.

When the White House tapped Klain to manage the execution of it's Ebola prevention strategy, he was billed as the adult in the room. Having served as two vice presidents' chief of staff, he was lauded by the administration and its allies as having the type of organizational skills necessary to coordinate a government-wide effort.

However conservatives immediately began to question Klain's credentials, particularly the fact that he had never handled a health crisis before. 

Other red flags began to pop up almost immediately. The newly announced Obama adviser accepted the critical position on a Friday but did not officially start work until the following Wednesday for untold reasons.

Though he was not technically on the job the first five days after President Barack Obama named him as the administration's Ebola czar, he did visit the White House just hours later. The following day he met with White House chief of staff Dennis McDonough and other administration officials.

Yet he skipped an all-hands on deck meeting that Saturday in the Oval Office that was deemed important enough for the president to cancel previously scheduled campaign events that afternoon to attend.

The next Monday he was absent from a conference call Centers for Disease Control and Prevention head Tom Frieden held with reporters to explain the agency's new 'tiered' risk system for evaluating Ebola threats.

And even through he had officially been on the government payroll for two days, he did not appear before a congressional committee last Friday that convened under special circumstances to demand answers from the administration after a second nurse who treated now-deceased Ebola patient Thomas Eric Duncan came down with the violent virus.

It was Frieden who was served up as the administration's sacrificial lamb at the hearing, just as it was Frieden who announced yesterday the government's new guidelines for the voluntary quarantining of health care workers returning from West Africa. 

And today it was Obama who took the lead in showcasing the government's actions. Before jetting off for an evening campaign event in Milwaukee, Wisconsin, Obama gave a statement to the press, during which he praised health care workers risking their lives to treat Ebola patients in Liberia, Sierra Leone and Guinea.

When again asked by a reporter yesterday what specific areas of the Ebola response are under Klain's authority, as it remains ambiguous, Earnest again said 'his principal responsibility is a behind-the-scenes role in coordinating the whole-of-government response that the President has directed be implemented to respond to this specific situation.

'And that means that he will work closely with the CDC and HHS, other White House officials, to make sure that the Ebola response is up to the high standards that the President has set,' Earnest explained. 

'That has in the past included conversations with state and local officials, and I’m confident those kinds of conversations will continue.'

Earnest then admitted that Klain has no plans to meet with elected officials in New Jersey or New York to discuss their mandatory 21-day quarantines for medical professionals who come in contact with Ebola carriers. 

He did however cite New Jersey Gov. Chris Christie's decision to let a nurse who tested negative for Ebola twice out of government custody as 'evidence that the ongoing coordination between the Obama administration and state and local officials continues successfully in this case.' 

What role Klain may have played in her release is unknown, as the Obama flak refused to give out details about which White House officials were in contact with Christie throughout the last several days.

But isn't it part of Klain's job to 'streamline the response all across the country?' a reporter asked Earnest. The press secretary didn't answer the question directly, opting to zero in his response on the reporters suggestion that a state-by-state approach to containing and preventing Ebola from spreading could cause 'panic' among Americans who have a limited understanding of the disease.

At another point in the briefing he said that because of federalism, states and localities are able to implement their own quarantine policies, regardless of what the CDC or the White House has suggested. 

 What exactly does Ebola czar Ron Klain do? 'His principal responsibility is a behind-the-scenes role in coordinating the whole-of-government response that the President has directed be implemented to respond to this specific situation,' White House Press Secretary Josh Earnest said yesterday

So, 'what has changed since [Klain] started his job?' a reporter asked Earnest

'Because it appears as though this week there's more confusion than there was last week, given what we're seeing in New York and New Jersey, and more differences between how the states are dealing with it.'

'I think the record should reflect that Mr. Klain started one week ago today last Wednesday,' Earnest told her. 'And in that time we have seen a significant number of announcements related to the whole-of-government approach that the President has ordered to dealing with the Ebola situation.' 

Admittedly, Earnest said Klain hadn't been involved in all of the administration's policy making given his recent start date, including the requirement that all passengers coming out of West Africa fly through five specific international airports.

'But I do think that what you see here is intensive coordination among a range of federal agencies to respond to this very difficult challenge.' 

The White House's vague responses had reporters leaving yesterday's hour-long briefing just as confused as they were when it began about what it exactly it is that the government is paying Klain to do.

Today Earnest again attempted to talk Klain up, saying he 'has been very hard at work in coordinating the whole-of-government approach that the president has mandated.'

'That means that Ron has arrived here at the White House early in the morning. He's stayed here late at night,' Earnest stated. 

Klain visited the Health and Human Services Department staff in Washington, D.C. last week, and Earnest confirmed today that he'll travel to the CDC headquarters in Atlanta, Georgia, in the near future to meet with officials there.

'I recognize that all of you have not had the chance to see him and talk to him every day but the president certainly has,' Earnest revealed. 

Klain is 'somebody with extensive management credentials both inside and outside of government ... who is on task and coordinating this very challenging problem,' the Obama flak added.

He later explained that Klain give Obama status updates 'regularly.' Earnest pointed out that he attended a meeting on Sunday with the president, as did other health and national security advisers.

'So I guess he's been here for seven days and he's seen the president on six of them.'

This photo, taken Sunday, shows nurse Kaci Hickox in an isolation tent at University Hospital in Newark, New Jersey, where she was quarantined following her work in West Africa caring for Ebola patients despite testing negative for the virus. Yesterday, she was released after White House administration officials pressured the New Jersey government behind the scenes. It's unclear if Klain was involved in that effort

One federal agency that the White House doesn't appear to have clear coordination with is the Department of Defense.

Yesterday, Army Chief of Staff, Gen. Ray Odierno, said all soldiers assigned to West Africa would undergo a mandatory 21-day quarantine. But that will not necessarily be a DOD-wide policy, Earnest told reporters today. DOD has yet to issue a formal policy that will govern quarantine measures, he said.

For more information on the military's plans, Earnest directed the press to DOD. 

The administration's frenzied response to the Ebola crisis had even sketch comedy show Saturday Night Live, which is notorious for it's spoofs of the president and other political figureheads, making fun of Klain in its latest episode.  

At a fake press conference, the show pointed out in its opening skit that Klain had zero experience handling a health crisis before this and suggested that his appointment was a political stunt to help Democrats win the midterm elections.

Republicans argued as much in the days immediately following his assignment to the high-profile post. 

Rep. Tom Price, one of a handful of physicians serving in Congress, claimed Obama made an 'unserious gesture at an incredibly serious moment.'

Likewise, House Energy and Commerce Committee chairman Fred Upton of Michigan said in a statement he 'was glad the president got off the campaign trail to finally focus on Ebola.'

'But with this appointment of a czar" with no health background, he just got right back on,' Upton accused.

But the White House can't point to a single thing that Klain has actually coordinated

GOP said from the beginning that Klain wasn't the right person to manage the government's Ebola efforts because he has no health crisis experience
