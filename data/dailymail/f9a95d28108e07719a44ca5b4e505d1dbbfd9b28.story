Awaiting sentencing for a murder committed in 2008 during a robbery of a Dunkin Donuts, a South Florida man took the stand and dared the judge: 'give me the death sentence because I'm innocent.'

A jury convicted James Herard, 25, back in May of 18 felony counts related to a string of armed robberies committed in Broward County in 2008 that ended with the deaths of two men.

According to the Sun-Sentinel, prosecutors said Herard shot 56-year-old Kiem Huynh of Fort Lauderdale in the back while he and four other men named as members of the Bacc Street Crips by investigators robbed a Dunkin' Donuts in Tamarac.

Proclaimed innocence: James Herard, 25, dared a judge to give him the death sentence after being convicted of 18 felony charges, including charges related to a double murder

Another member, Tharod Bell, 29, allegedly shot a second victim, Eric Jean-Pierre, though Herard was implicated for encouraging the murder.

NBC Miami reports that Herard was on the stand on Friday arguing that he wanted the judge to him the death penalty.

'I’m not asking you to spare me,' he told the judge. 'Go ahead and do what you gonna do. I pretty much dare you to give me the death sentence because I’m innocent.'

'I know the Supreme Court won’t allow me to die for something I didn’t commit,' he added.

During a confession taped in 2008 and shown to jurors, Herard told an interrogator, about Eric Jean-Pierre: 'That's not my body, but you might as well give it to me, because he [Bell] wouldn't have pulled the trigger if I didn't provoke it.'

Herard claimed in court that the six-hour confession was coerced.

Local 10 reports during Friday's hearing, the defense called witnesses that attested to Herard's positive impact in prison, where he's acted as mentor and teacher, even helping other inmates write letters.

Gang activity: Police charge that the robberies were committed by Herard and four others while part of the Bacc Street Crips

Strange behavior: Herard played to courtroom cameras during his trial, and was shown barking at a judge during a hearing in 2008

'He helped me get in contact with my family,' testified inmate Angelo Coicou. 'He helped me far as -- I didn't know how to read, basically.'

Herard is already serving numerous life sentences for crimes committed in Palm Beach County, where his crew left two men seriously disfigured during armed robberies.

He has been prone to outbursts and strange behavior during the lengthy trial, even barking like dog at a judge in 2008.
