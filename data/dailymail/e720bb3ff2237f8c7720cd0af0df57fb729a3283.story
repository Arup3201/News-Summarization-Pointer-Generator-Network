A yoga teacher may have been sacked by her jealous ex-Playboy Playmate boss for being 'too cute' but that's not grounds for a gender discrimination lawsuit, the centerfold's lawyer said today.

Manhattan instructor Dilek Edwards is suing former nude model Stephanie Adams and her husband Charles Nicolai for sacking her last year over her good looks.

But in papers filed in Manhattan Supreme Court today, the couple's lawyer Douglas Wigdor contends the gender discrimination lawsuit should be tossed because people can't be legally discriminated against for 'attractiveness'.

New York Daily News reported that court documents showed Edwards was fired out of jealousy.

However the paper also said that Wigdor denied that claim in court today but said, if that was the reason, it would not amount to gender discrimination or sexual harassment.

Edwards, 32, claims she went to work with Adams’ husband in April 2012, providing yoga and massage therapy services at the couple's Wall Street Chiropractic and Wellness clinic.

She said she had a 'strictly cordial and professional' relationship with Nicolai.

However, she claimed he had warned her in June that his wife 'might become jealous' after 
she gave him yoga-therapy sessions to help with chronic pain, telling 
her 'it had to be a secret'.

On October 30, Edwards said that she 
got a 'frantic' text at 1.31 a.m. from Adams that said, 'You are NOT 
welcome any longer at Wall Street Chiropractic, DO NOT ever step foot in
 there again, and stay the f*** away from my husband and family.'

'And remember I warned you,' Adams allegedly said, according to the New York Post.

Adams,
 43, who became the first openly lesbian Playmate after being featured 
as Miss November in 1992, dismissed Edwards' claims as nonsense, saying, 
'No disrespect to anyone - but I'm a centerfold.'

The yoga teacher is seeking unspecified damages, alleging sexual harassment, gender discrimination and unlawful termination.

Former Playboy centerfold Adams still identifies with the LGBT community, despite having a son with Nicolai.

She has also in the past claimed to be a 'direct descendant' of Presidents John Adams and John Quincy Adams.

'I can only imagine they’re rolling over in their graves because of the outrageous behavior of their purported descendant,' said Edwards’ lawyer, Maimon Kirschenbaum.

In 2012, Adams won $1.2 million from New York City because she was arrested in 2006 for allegedly threatening to shoot a cab driver with a gun.

It was proven that Adams couldn't have been carrying a gun because she was wearing skin tight clothing.
