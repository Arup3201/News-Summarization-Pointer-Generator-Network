Grisly discovery: Ashley Immel, 20, discovered the parts of two mutilated dogs dumped in her driveway in two weeks

A woman who found a disemboweled and headless Chihuahua in her car on Thursday morning believes she was targeted by boys she had brawled with.

Ashley Immel called police when she discovered the decapitated dog on the driver's seat of her black Honda sedan in the driveway of her Knights Landing, California, home.

'It was like properly placed there for it to be seen like here you go look at this,' the 20-year-old told News10.

She said the dog appeared to be mutilated with a sharp object like a knife.

Immel said this was the second time parts of a canine were dumped on her 4th Street property.

Two weeks ago, she spotted the head of a terrier inside her boat, but she only reported it on Thursday after the second attack.

The dogs did not belong to her.

Immel, who drives trucks according to her Facebook page, told News10 she thinks fights in her past have come back to haunt her.

'No one likes to get beat up by a girl,' she said.

'There was a few tussles and you probably won't forget something like that along those lines of getting beat up by a girl.

However Immel admitted she has had problems with other people in the neighborhood and could not identify possible culprits.

Yolo Sheriff’s Department chief animal services officer, Vicky Fletcher, believes the two crimes are related.

She said it was likely the Chihuahua was killed elsewhere because there was little blood in the car.

'[Animal] control officers are also mandated child abuse reporters because generally when somebody will do this to an animal they sometimes will do it to humans as well,' Fletcher told News10.

'We are hoping someone might come forward if they saw something, or if they’ve had an animal go missing recently.'
