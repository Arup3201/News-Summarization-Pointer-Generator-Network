Sarah Ferguson showed off her style credentials as she strolled around New York in a chic monochrome outfit yesterday.

The 54-year-old appeared to be taking advantage of unseasonably warm weather in the American city as she walked around town without her coat on.

The Duchess of York wore a crisp white shirt, high-waisted black skirt with studded belt and patent pumps.

Suits you, Sarah! The Duchess of York was seen taking advantage of unseasonably warm weather in New York City yesterday

She wore her red hair loose and accessorised with simple gold hooped earrings as she smiled cheerfully.

She could well have been visiting her youngest daughter, Princess Eugenie, who is currently living and working in New York.

The 23-year-old has just landed a job at a New York online auction house Paddle8 as a benefit 
auctions manager.

Clearly making the most of her time stateside, Princess Eugenie recently appeared on the front row of the Nonoo show, Fall 2014 at New York Fashion Week.

However,
 according to reports, Eugenie is not turning her back on her homeland 
completely and will travel back and forth between the Big Apple and 
London.

Family first: The Duchess of York could well be visiting her youngest daughter, Eugenie, who is working out in New York

She moved to 
Manhattan last year, initially joining the company last September on a 
three-month placement, but has now been offered a more permenant role.

Ever the family woman, the former wife of Prince Andrew was seen dining with her ex-husband and eldest daughter, Beatrice, just last week.

The former couple dined with their daughter in 
London's fashionable East End.

The happy trio had a quiet family supper at the fashionable Les Trois Garcons on Bethnal Green Road.

Slimmer frame: It was revealed late last year that Sarah Ferguson has lost two stone after embarking on a gruelling three-month bootcamp in the Swiss Alps

It was an unusual choice for the group – edgy Shoreditch, although gentrified, isn’t yet a royal stamping ground.

Sarah Ferguson looked chic - and very 
trim - in a stylish all-black outfit, featuring a slightly more racy slit up the 
front.

The
 newly-trim Duchess of York, who once weighed almost 16 stone, shed 
the pounds with the help of her personal trainer of 20 years Josh Salzmann.

She
 has reportedly seen the weight fall off after sticking to a strict diet
 of blended foods, daily runs and mountain hikes over the past 12 weeks.
