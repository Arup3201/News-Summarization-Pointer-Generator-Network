Within hours of posting the image of her oiled-up derrière, the internet went to town on creating their own versions of Kim Kardashian's behind.

From centaurs to docking stations, the online world found the most comical ways of parodying the lewd cover.

And now an artist famous for immortalising public figures as Simpsons has got in on the act.

It was only a matter of time: Kim Kardashian West has been given a Simpson makeover by artist aleXsandro Palombo, who is known for transforming public figures into the yellow characters

Italian AleXsandro Palombo has transformed Mrs Kardashian West into a dead ringer for a cast member of The Simpsons in a series of illustrations.

The contemporary artist, illustrator and activist has 'Simpsonized' the reality TV star and her 'iconic booty' on his blog.

Speaking about his creation, he told MailOnline: 'I like Kim Kardashian and the first thing I thought when I saw the cover was "OK, sexy and bold" but I found nothing brilliant and, allow me to say it, her ass is far too big.

'If you look closely at the picture, there is no balance and the perspective is very wrong and disproportionate.

'In my work I have reshaped her booty in order to give harmony and balance. I wanted to improve and capture the best of Kardashian's back, without overdoing it. I like her but I'm just terrified about what will happen in a few years when her booty will "collapse".'

Spot the difference: Kim has been subject to much mocking and parodying on social media and this yellow makeover is the latest

Mythical beast: One internet user turned Kim Kardashian into a beautiful centaur in a hilarious meme - after seeing her naked shoot for Paper magazine 

Twitter user @KelKulus was reminded of a mythical creature when he saw the Paper magazine image, tweeting his own version with the caption: 'Kim Kardashian looks so much like a centaur in Paper Magazine, I figured I'd take it one step further.'

Kim's rear becomes the rump of a horse, turning the reality star into a centaur, who certainly wouldn't have been booted out of the Forbidden Forest.

The wife of Kanye West was then given the capital treatment by @AngryBritain, who joked that the Barclays Cycle Hire Docking Stations have been given a bootylicious makeover.

Dock of the week! Barclays Cycle Hire have a new style of docking stations endorsed by the Mayor of London

Two birds, one stone: Another user mocked Kim and Russell Brand at the same time

'@MayorOfLondon unveils new style Boris Bike rack coming to the streets of the capital soon,' the parody tweeter posted with an image of Boris Johnson parking his bike between Kim's cheeks.

@GeneralBoles killed two celebrity birds with one stone by photoshopping Russell Brand's face onto Kim's derriere with a speech bubble exclaiming 'PARKLIFE!'

Food items has also been another way to describe Kim's glistening rear; from peaches and potatoes to glazed donuts the internet went to the market on comparisons. 

'Krispy Kim' proved to be an apt nickname for the reality star, and her rear was even replaced with two pieces of Aero chocolate.   

She's had the yellow touch, too! Alexsandro also gave the Duchess of Cambridge a Simpson makeover to celebrate her best style moments

Guess who? George and Amal Clooney were also transformed by the artist following their wedding this summer
