The two children suffocated by their mother in Spain were not fathered by her paedophile partner, a court heard yesterday.

Lianne Smith looked furious when the shock DNA results were read out to the jury and denounced them as 'mistaken'.

She has admitted killing Rebecca, five, and 11-month-old Daniel in their hotel beds on the Costa Brava in May 2010 after her partner was arrested on child sex charges.

The jury of seven men and two women retired to consider their verdicts at 11.30am local time.

Smith admits suffocating Rebecca and Daniel but claims to have been in an unsound mental state at the time of the killings

Lianne Smith is led into court in Girona, Spain, this morning on the third day of her murder trial, where the court heard DNA tests prove her partner did not father her victims

Judge Adolfo Garcia Morales told them that if they find Smith not guilty of murder on the grounds of insanity, she will be sent to a secure psychiatric hospital until she is cured.

He said: 'If a person is completely insane they must be acquitted and there is no sentence. But they are not released into the street.

'They are sent to a secure psychiatric unit until they are cured. That might be two years or it might be 25 years. They are not released until they are cured.'

The prosecution accepts Smith suffers from an unspecified psychosis but claim it is not too severe that she cannot be held accountable for her crimes.

Defence lawyer Jenifer Lahoz Abos argues Smith suffers from such a severe mental illness she cannot be heard criminally responsible for their deaths.

She is seeking an acquittal, claiming Smith was in a state of ‘psychiatric disturbance’ and suffering insurmountable fear when the tragedy happened.

Martin Smith, who was found dead in his cell in January

Yesterday a psychiatrist claimed Smith smothered her children with a plastic bag 'out of love' because she did not want them taken into care.

Her partner, TV hypnostist Martin Smith, hanged himself in prison earlier this year – believing his partner had killed his son and daughter. But they were not his children, the jury at Girona provincial court in north-east Spain, was told.

A police witness, identified only by her badge number 12602, revealed: 'DNA tests on the children showed that Martin Smith was not their biological father.' Smith, 45, of Lichfield, Staffordshire, reacted with fury and insisted the tests were wrong.

She gave birth to Daniel in 2009 while on the run in Spain with Mr Smith. Her daughter Rebecca had been born in the UK in 2005 while she and Mr Smith – who shared a surname but were not married – were living together.

Their relationship was violent and Smith's two older children from a previous relationship, witnessed ugly rows.

Her eldest daughter, Sarah Richardson, now 24, was repeatedly raped by her stepfather over nearly a decade. When she finally told police – and later waived her right to anonymity – Mr Smith was arrested but ran away to Spain before his trial.

Smith fled with him, and while living a fugitive lifestyle in Barcelona, she found a job in a nursery, and then became pregnant with Daniel.

The couple fled their first flat in Barcelona within hours of Daniel being born. An American neighbour told the Mail: 'It was very strange. She came back from hospital after giving birth to her little boy and left the same day. We never saw them again.'

Police eventually tracked down Martin Smith in May 2010 and deported him to the UK where he was found guilty of sexually abusing his stepdaughter Sarah and sentenced to 16 years in prison.

He committed suicide in January this 
year, aged 46. Two weeks after his arrest, Lianne Smith, a former 
manager of children's services at Cumbria county council, suffocated her
 children in the Hotel Miramar in Lloret de Mar after giving them a 
'perfect holiday'.

She spent the night with their  lifeless bodies before asking the hotel receptionist to call police.

Martin Smith was previously thought to be the father of Daniel and Rebecca, whom his partner has admitted killing in a Spanish hotel room

Yesterday her trial heard she had 
'killed them out of love' – because she feared social services were 
about to take them away.  Forensic psychiatrist Itziar Idiaquez Alberdi 
said: 'She believed the children would be taken away from her and 
institutionalised. For her, this was worse than death.

'She had spoken about this with her 
partner (Martin Smith) and they had talked about taking their own lives 
if they were ever separated.'

Asked if Smith could distinguish between 
good and evil when she killed the children, the psychiatrist replied: 
'She was convinced that it was the best thing she could do. She killed 
them out of love. She loved the children.'

Prison psychiatrist Harry Barker said
 Smith viewed the deaths of her two children as 'an unavoidable 
catastrophe'. She suffered from a psychosis that made her lose contact 
with reality, he told the court.

Smith had asked her young daughter if
 she would prefer to live 'a few very happy days with her mother or a 
long time without her mother', he said.

Rebecca had apparently answered she 
wanted to stay with her mother. After killing the children, Smith cut 
her wrists and attempted to hang herself. But forensic doctor Elisabet 
Vazquez Martinez said Smith's injuries were only 'superficial'.

The jury must decide if Smith is criminally responsible or mentally ill. The trial continues.
