Diplomatic Protection Officer James Addison, 37, used Whatsapp to send 'disgusting' images to colleagues while on duty

A police constable who worked at Downing Street during the Plebgate scandal has been spared jail after he admitted sending colleagues extreme porn while on duty.

Diplomatic Protection Officer James Addison, 37, distributed the 'disgusting and offensive images' to fellow officers from his mobile phone using Whatsapp.

The court heard the elite policeman believed he was passing on the disturbing content 'as a joke'.

But he was arrested after detectives discovered the sickening images during an investigation into his unit as part of Operation Alice, a probe into the controversy which led to Tory MP Andrew Mitchell's resignation. 

Westminster Crown Court heard the pictures included bizarre sex acts and scenes showing defecation.

He was fined £6,000 and told the images go 'way beyond what is legal in this country.'

Wearing a black suit and tie and yellow shirt, he hugged tearful relatives as he left the courtroom a free man, although he is likely to lose his job.

District Judge Howard Riddle told Addison: 'Even at a time when the state has retreated to a huge extent in sexual judgment and taste and humour, these images go some way beyond what is legal in this country.

'These images are very unusual indeed.'

Sparing the officer a jail sentence, the judge added: 'The situation would be very different indeed if this involved children and similarly if there had been involvement of animals.

'I sentence you on the basis that there were no obviously unwilling participants in the films.

'Perhaps the greatest harm is that at least some of these images were received and sent while you were working and while you were being paid by the public to carry out a very important task on behalf of the public.'

The judge also accepted that the images had been sent to 'shock and amuse' rather than for profit and that Addison had not been involved in making them.

'I fall short of saying that you are not worthy of wearing a police uniform, that is for somebody else to decide,' he said.

The court heard that Addison is facing an internal misconduct investigation and remains suspended.

He pleaded guilty to 11 counts of publishing an obscene article under the Obscene Publications Act last month.

Westminster Magistrates' Court heard the elite police officer sent pictures and video clips that included 'bizarre' sex acts. Detectives then found the content during a probe into the Plebgate scandal

Prosecutor Emma Scheer said officers on the Plebgate investigation found that Addison sent 'images of an extreme pornographic nature and some of an obscene nature'.

In total, 15 people received images from him, all of them police officers, between February and June last year.

'Some were sent whilst he was on duty and on some occasions they were sent to multiple recipients at the same time,' she told the court.

'In terms of the images, some were likely to result in the infliction of serious harm to at least one of those involved and others featured defecation.'

Defending, James Hines said that the images had been sent as a joke rather than for sexual gratification.

Mr Hines said of his client: 'He hasn’t lost his job but he undoubtedly will do so, there is no doubt about that.

District Judge Howard Riddle told Addison that the content he sent went 'some way beyond what is legal in this country'. He was fined £6,000 and faces losing his job

'He is a man of previous good character - a good, solid, hard-working officer and family man,' he said.

In total 14 officers have been subject to criminal investigation over possession of and distribution of obscene images on mobile phones.

Four officers from the Diplomatic Protection Group (DPG), including Addison, were arrested but only he was charged.

No further action was taken against the other three in relation to the criminal allegations but they have been the subject of a misconduct probe with eight other officers from the DPG, and two officers based in boroughs.

The images were found on Addison's computer during the investigation into Plebgate, but he was not implicated in the scandal.

Former Chief Whip and Tory MP Andrew Mitchell stepped down after the Plebgate affair

Former Chief Whip Andrew Mitchell resigned after he was accused of launching a foul-mouthed rant at officers guarding Downing Street.

The row ignited when Mr Mitchell was accused of the calling them 'plebs' during the outburst on September 19, 2012.

The images Addison sent were discovered during the exhaustive £250,000 internal investigation into the controversial affair, known as Operation Alice.

Forensic analysis of phones and computers were part of the lengthy probe.

Every officer in the Diplomatic Protection Group (DPG) was questioned.

Some 30 detectives took statements from all 800 officers in the elite unit as part of the inquiry.

In total 14 officers were subject
 to criminal investigation over possession of and distribution of 
obscene images on mobile phones.
