A pub is looking for a new landlord and the highest bidder will get their own private island thrown in with the deal as a cash-strapped council looks to slash its spending.

The Gull and Leek comes complete with an 86-acre beer garden - better known as Flat Holm Island which stands five miles out to sea in the Bristol Chanel.

The Victorian pub - one of the most remote bars in Britain, with a flock of 70 sheep its only regulars - has been put on the market by Cardiff Council, which said it can no longer afford to keep the island.

Unique: Visitors to Flat Holm Island often end their trip with a pint in the Gull and Leek pub

The local authority owns and runs the the islands - which has been home to monks, Vikings, Victorians and World War II soldiers - as a tourists attraction.

Island warden Matt Lipton, 27, said: 'The pub is unique feature of Flat Holm. We felt the island needed a boost, we decided to open a pub and it's really added another element.

'We've had people come over for the day, enjoy the scenery and wildlife- then finish off with a pint in the Gull and Leek.'

The pub is housed in a converted Victorian cottage, but Flat Holm is also home to 100ft tall Grade II-listed lighthouse, two helipads, gun batteries.

Since the bar opened 18-months ago it has been visited by more thank 2,000 people who came to take in the unbeatable sea views while having a drink in the tranquil scenery.

The island's three wardens took turns at being landlord pulling pints for their customers.

They served Brains bitter from the 
famous Cardiff brewery which was shipped in along with bottled beer from
 Welsh brewery Tomos Watkin.

It
 took beer-lovers a lot of effort to pop in for a pint, with the pub 
being a 50-minute boat trip from the mainland and a 20-minute hike over 
the cliffs.

But Cardiff Council is proposing to stop visits to the island and sell of the wildlife haven.

The new owner will join Leonardo DiCaprio, Mel Gibson and Sir Richard Branson in the elite group of people with private islands.

Estate agent Chris Hyde, who specialises in Island sales, said: 'The interest will be worldwide.

Good company: The highest bidder will join the likes of Leonardo DiCaprio in owning a private island

'Flat Holm is a fascinating prospect, it's already got buildings which opens up the potential for someone to live there.

'There's
 something about the excitement of owning your own island - the fact you
 can roam around and not have a single person on your doorstep.'

The Labour-run council are keen to cut the £150,000 annual running costs as part of their bid to try and save around £110m.

Council member Russell Goodway said: 'The picture is far from rosy. I am not looking to put a gloss on it or spin. There is no escaping the pain.'

Flat Holm has been used as hideaway for smugglers and a sanitorium for cholera victims and was leased to the council in 1896 by Marquis of Bute.

Famous: Flat Holm Island received the world's first radio message across water by Marconi in 1897

Location, location, location: The island was used as a location in the television series Torchwood

It has been used as a location for the TV series Torchwood but is more famous for receiving the world's first radio message across water by Marconi in 1897.

The island has been designated a Site of Special Scientific Interest thanks to its huge gull colony and maritime grassland.

The Flat Holm Society has launched a campaign to save the island, hoping a trust could be set to ensure it remains accessible to the public.

Society chair Glynis Parsons said: 'A lot of people are very sad and shocked.

'It's a nature conservation area, it's got a long history and it would be a big loss - it's a gem in South Wales and there are not many councils that own an island.'

In a council meeting, the authority 
revealed that it was selling off the boat used to take visitors to 
the island and putting the isle up for sale.

A report for councillors, given before Christmas, said that considerable investment would be needed to turn Flat Holm into a profit-making, unusual holiday destination.

Councillors were told: 'The visitor and 
income profile for Flat Holm demonstrates that demand for the island is 
highly concentrated in the summer months and is insufficient to cover 
the operating costs of the facility.

The dedicated website to the lonely 
island boasts of its diverse wildlife and stunning scenery in a bid to 
raise the profile of the isle.

It
 describes how Flat Holm has a wealth of historic buildings, including a
 lighthouse built in 1737 and Victorian and World War II gun emplacements.

It is also housed a former Cholera hospital and fog horn station buildings.

The islans is a Local Nature Reserve, Site of 
Special Scientific Interest and a Special Protection Area.

It has a rich varies of maritime grassland and rare plants, from Rock Sea-Lavender to 
Wild Leek.

'It
 is proposed to cease all visits to the island, and dispose of the 
island to a third party with no further council involvement.

'Visits to the island could be ceased promptly while options for disposal are explored.'

Holm lies in the Bristol Channel around four miles from the Welsh coast and is considered part of Wales.

It is little more than a third of a mile across and is well known as the spot where Marconi, a telecommunications company, made the first radio transmission across open water.

In the years either side of the turn of the 20th century it was also used by the military and as an isolation hospital for sailors arriving at Cardiff docks with cholera.

A spokesman said no decisions had been made, but anyone interested in Flat Holm should get in touch.

She said: 'Where it is proposed facilities are closing we will be looking for expressions of interest from groups such as co-operatives and social enterprises to try to ensure they continue.'
