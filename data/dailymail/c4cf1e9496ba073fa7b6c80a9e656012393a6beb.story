Pep Guardiola has hailed new signing Xabi Alonso - but has warned that Bayern Munich's players must give him some help on the pitch or he 'will be dead'.

Alonso will line up against Manchester City in the Champions League on Wednesday and he has seamlessly integrated into the Bayern team, running the show in the 2-0 win over Stuttgart on Saturday.

Guardiola said: 'With Xabi we had a lot of possession against Stuttgart. He knows his job in this position.

'He has an eye for short and long passes but we have to help him because if he does everything then he will be dead.'

Alonso was brought in from Real Madrid as a replacement for Toni Kroos and has been a shining light as Bayern have made a slightly sluggish start to the season.

The Spaniard has been especially important as fellow midfielders Javi Martinez, Thiago Alcantara and Bastian Schweinsteiger have been out injured.
