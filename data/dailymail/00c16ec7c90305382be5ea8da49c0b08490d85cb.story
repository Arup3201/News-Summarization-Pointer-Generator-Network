This little boy, 5, cannot laugh or smile because he suffers from a rare condition which has paralysed his facial muscles.

Isaac Hughes is one of just 200 people in the UK who suffers from Moebius Syndrome, a condition with no cure, which has left him expressionless.

The boy from Mold, north Wales is also unable to blink on reflex and could not walk until he was three.

Expressionless: Isaac Hughes, 5, is one of just 200 people in the UK who suffers from Moebius Syndrome, a condition which meant he cannot laugh or smile and blink on reflex

Now his parents Ceridwen and Philip and uncle David Baynton-Power of 90s rock band James, are trying to raise £250,000 for the Moebius Research Trust to fund research into the condition.

Mrs Hughes said: ‘The syndrome affects Isaac's ability to speak as well as smile and this causes considerable problems although he is such a happy, strong-willed, tenacious child that nothing stands in his way of telling a story, even if he can't say the actual words.

‘It can be very frustrating and every single day you come across a different challenge.’

To date there is no cure and no research has been carried out to identify a cause so there is no way of preventing it from affecting other people, she said.

Isaac, a pupil at Ysgol Glanrafon in Glanrafon, Mold was diagnosed with Moebius syndrome at eight-months-old, the condition which has also affected his speech and his ability to articulate emotions through words.

Mr Baynton-Power said: ‘My sister-in-law told me about the Moebius Research Trust and how it is trying to raise sufficient funds to carry out research into this very distressing condition. When I was approached by the charity to be a patron I was happy to help.

‘This is such a worthwhile cause.’

The condition can also cause hearing 
difficulties, eye sensitivity due to the inability to blink or squint, 
and missing limbs, fingers or toes.

Moebius syndrome is present at birth and affects some cranial nerves, leaving sufferers unable to move their faces.

Some symptoms can be treated with the right therapy and surgery.

The condition is named after Paul Julius Möbius, a German neurologist who first described the syndrome in 1888.
