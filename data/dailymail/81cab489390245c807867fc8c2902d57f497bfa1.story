Barcelona legend Hristo Stoichkov is hoping Real Madrid fans do the right thing and applaud Lionel Messi if the Argentine star breaks the La Liga goalscoring record during Saturday's El Clasico.

Messi can go level with the Spanish league's top goalscorer of all-time, Telmo Zarra, if he scores against Real Madrid and would set a new record if manages a double at the Bernabeu.

'Why would Madrid fans not tribute Leo?' Stoichkovtold told SA during the week. 'They do applaud Barca players, remember Ronaldinho scored in the Clasico and some clapped him.

Lionel Messi is currently one goal behind Telmo Zarra's La Liga goalscoring record

Bulgarian legend Hristo Stoichkov made 26 appearance for Barcelona in the 1990s 

'Messi is mythical, it would be arrogant not to applaud a myth. That would just show you cannot see beyond the football team you play for.

'Likewise, I believe that Camp Nou would applaud Cristiano Ronaldo.'

The Bulgarian thinks whichever side handles the pressure of the contest between the Spanish giants at the Bernabeu will prevail.  

Four-time Ballon d'Or winner Messi will come up against Real Madrid star Cristiano Ronaldo once more

'Barcelona are not as rampant as Madrid at the moment,' added Stoichkov. 'Madrid are scoring a lot. But they are under pressure and will go seven points behind if they lose to Barca.

'It will be a close game and whoever has less nerves will be the winner.'
