This is the shocking moment where Seattle Seahawks cornerback Jeremy Lane's wrist was snapped during a brutal tackle at the Super Bowl.

It was the first quarter of the Super Bowl XLIX game and New England Patriots were poised to score and take the lead during their second possession when Lane intercepted a poor attempted endzone pass by the New England Patriots' Tom Brady.

The Seahawks cornerback was running the ball back to the 14-yard-line where he was tackled by Julian Edelman.

Ouch! Seattle Seahawks cornerback Jeremy Lane lands badly after a tackle-  his wrist bending backwards at a 90 degree angle

Sent flying into the air, Lane lands badly. As these gruesome pictures show, the 24-year-old landed on his wrist which was bent back to an unnatural angle before it snaps.

He was rushed off the field and into the locker rooms for an x-ray but, unsurprisingly, he did not return to play for the rest of the game.

The injury signaled bad luck for the Seahawks who lost the game to the New England Patriots 24-28 on Sunday.

Jeremy Lane had made the first big play to negate a nearly eight-minute drive by the Patriots with a leaping interception at the goal line late in the first quarter. Lane made his first pro interception, but was replaced by Tharold Simon after the injury, who got torched by Brady the rest of the way.

Brady overcame a second interception and threw for four touchdowns, while Malcolm Butler intercepted Russell Wilson's pass in the end zone with 20 seconds left, helping the New England Patriots beat the Seattle Seahawks 28-24 Sunday night for their fourth Super Bowl title. 

The game ended with Seahawks linebacker Bruce Irvin being ejected in the final seconds for instigating a near-brawl, delaying the celebration for the Patriots.

Sunday's Super Bowl was a record-breaker for New England Patriots quarterback Brady who surpassed Joe Montana's record of 11 Super Bowl touchdowns. Brady has equaled Montana with four Lombardi Trophies and three Super Bowl MVPs. He stands alone with 13 Super Bowl touchdown passes. 

The Patriots are still being investigated for using for those under-inflated footballs the AFC championship game. 

With New England Patriots holding a 28-24 lead in the final minute, the game temporarily spiraled out of control after Patriots quarterback Tom Brady tried to run out the clock
