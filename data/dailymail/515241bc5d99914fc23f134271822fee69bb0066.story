The failed Scottish vote to pull out from the United Kingdom stirred 
secessionist hopes for some in the United States, where almost a quarter
 of people are open to their states leaving the union, a new 
Reuters/Ipsos poll found.

Some 23.9 percent of Americans polled 
from August 23 through September 16 said they strongly supported or tended to 
support the idea of their state breaking away, while 53.3 per cent of the
 8,952 respondents strongly opposed or tended to oppose the notion.

The urge to sever ties with Washington cuts across party lines and 
regions, though Republicans and residents of rural Western states are 
generally warmer to the idea than Democrats and Northeasterners, 
according to the poll.

Hitting the trail: Some 23.9 percent of Americans polled from Aug. 23 through Sept. 16 - many in the southwest - said they strongly supported or tended to support the idea of their state breaking away

Anger with President Barack Obama's 
handling of issues ranging from healthcare reform to the rise of Islamic
 State militants drives some of the feeling, with Republican respondents
 citing dissatisfaction with his administration as coloring their 
thinking.

But others said long-running Washington gridlock had 
prompted them to wonder if their states would be better off striking out
 on their own, a move no U.S. state has tried in the 150 years since the
 bloody Civil War that led to the end of slavery in the South.

'I don't think it makes a whole lot of difference anymore which 
political party is running things. Nothing gets done,' said Roy 
Gustafson, 61, of Camden, South Carolina, who lives on disability 
payments. 'The state would be better off handling things on its own.'

Scottish unionists won by a wider-than-expected 10-percentage-point margin.

Falling public approval of the Obama administration, attention to the 
Scottish vote and the success of activists who accuse the U.S. 
government of overstepping its authority - such as the self-proclaimed 
militia members who flocked to Nevada's Bundy ranch earlier this year 
during a standoff over grazing rights - is driving up interest in 
secession, experts said.

'It seems to have heated up, especially 
since the election of President Obama,' said Mordecai Lee, a professor 
of governmental affairs at the University of Wisconsin at Milwaukee, who
 has studied secessionist movements.

Republicans were more inclined to support the idea, with 29.7 per cent favoring it compared with 21 per cent of Democrats.

Brittany Royal, a 31-year-old nurse from Wilkesboro, North Carolina, 
said anger over the 'Obamacare' healthcare reform law made her wonder if
 her state would be better off on its own.

'That has really hurt a lot of people here, myself included. My 
insurance went from $40 a week for a family of four up to over $600 a 
month for a family of four,' said Royal, a Republican. 'The North 
Carolina government itself is sustainable. Governor (Pat) McCrory, I 
think he has a better healthcare plan than President Obama.'

By 
region, the idea was least popular in New England, the cradle of the 
Revolutionary War, with just 17.4 per cent of respondents open to pulling
 their state out.

It was most popular in the Southwest, where 34.1 per cent of respondents back the idea.

That region includes Texas, where an activist group is calling the 
state's legislature to put the secession question on a statewide ballot.

One Texan respondent said he was confident his state could get by 
without the rest of the country.

'Texas has everything we need. 
We have the manufacturing, we have the oil, and we don't need them,' 
said Mark Denny, a 59-year-old retiree living outside Dallas on 
disability payments.

Denny, a Republican, had cheered on the Scottish independence movement.

'I have totally, completely lost faith in the federal government, the 
people running it, whether Republican, Democrat, independent, whatever,'
 he said.

Even in Texas, some respondents said talk about 
breaking away was more of a sign of their anger with Washington than 
evidence of a real desire to go it alone.

Democrat Lila Guzman, of Round
 Rock, said the threat could persuade Washington lawmakers and the White
 House to listen more closely to average people's concerns.

'When
 I say secede, I'm not like (former National Rifle Association 
president) Charlton Heston with my gun up in the air, 'my cold dead 
hands.' It's more like – we could do it if we had to,' said Guzman, 62. 'But the first option is, golly, get it back on the right track. Not all
 is lost. But there might come a point that we say, 'Hey, y'all, we're 
dusting our hands and we're moving on.''
