If you gave the dustmen a hefty tip this Christmas because you feel guilty about the amount of rubbish you put out, you might want  to take a leaf out of John Newson’s book.

Yesterday he celebrated achieving his goal of producing only one bag of refuse in an entire year.

Mr Newson has picked through his leftovers every day since last New Year’s Day, putting all his uneaten food on a compost heap in his garden.

He does not eat meat or fish,  and he grows his own salad and fruit to cut down on supermarket packaging.

The 60-year-old also separates out 
his cardboard, paper, plastic bottles, glass and cans for weekly 
kerbside collections by the council – and because those items can then 
be recycled, they don’t count towards his annual rubbish tally.

He even travels from his home in 
Balsall Heath, Birmingham, to Bristol and London to recycle margarine 
tubs and Tetra Pak juice cartons because he believes those cities have 
better recycling facilities.

The single bin bag he has been left 
with after 365 days of living as possibly the greenest householder in 
Britain is full of plastic film  packaging which he cannot recycle and 
has been unable to find a use for in his home.

Mr Newson, who works as a 
self-employed environmental re-searcher, said yesterday: ‘People ask, 
“Why on earth are you doing this?”

Back to the earth: John's resolution to compost waste meant that he was able to fill just one bag of rubbish for the year

Reaping the benefits: Through careful recycling and composting, John has been able to grow his own fruit. The 60-year-old says he understand it would be harder for larger households, but says Britain could improve its recycling habits

John says far too many plastic bags are being wasted in Britain

‘I just wondered, if you compost 
absolutely everything that will rot and recycle everything you can, what
will you be left with?

‘I wanted to push myself to an 
extreme to see how far I could  go. If you had six children and  lots of
disposable nappies it would be different.

‘But I’m not doing this to score 
points off any other household in Birmingham, I’m just asking what could
we feasibly get our recycling rate up to. I’d say that 80 to 90 per 
cent of all waste can be composted or recycled. At the moment in Britain
it’s about 30 per cent.

‘There are 52 weeks in the year and 
400,000 households across Birmingham, so that’s 20million plastic bin 
bags that are being  produced, distributed, collected and burned each 
year.’

He added: ‘Recycling some things is 
not that easy in Birmingham. I’ve taken some things, like drink cartons,
to the recycling centre but there’s a difference between what’s 
possible and what’s convenient.’

Birmingham’s recycling rate of 31.5 
per cent puts it in the bottom quarter of councils nationwide in terms 
of recycling and waste management.

Bristol is one of the leading cities in the country, with a rate of around 50 per cent between April and June this year.

According to figures released by the 
Department for Environment, Food and Rural Affairs, nearly 23million 
tons of household waste was generated over 2011/12.
