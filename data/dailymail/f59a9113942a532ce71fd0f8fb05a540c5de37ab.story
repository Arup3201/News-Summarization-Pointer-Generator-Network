Anthony Hughes has been jailed for life after admitting murdering his father Brian Hughes

A vicious son beat his terminally ill father to death after he brooded for up to 20 years over the bitter break-up of his family.

Anthony Hughes, 32, had been resentful over the way his mother Susan was treated by Brian Hughes during their stormy relationship.

But his hatred turned to murder on Easter Sunday following a series of rows just ten days after he was forced to move back in with his 60-year old estranged father.

In the days before the killing, Hughes jnr text his mother in a rage asking: 'Can I kill the f..g bastard - he talks a lot of sh*t.'

Then tragedy struck during another family bust up when he jumped on his father as he lay on a sofa and repeatedly punched him in the face.

As his half sister ran out onto the street to get help, Hughes dragged his father outside as the victim tried to get to his feet - and then began kicking and stamping on his head up to 20 times as he lay on the ground.

A
999 operator who fielded a call about the fatal beating listened as his
half sister Rebecca Gosling was heard screaming in horror as she 
witnessed the killing.

While police dashed to the scene, Hughes jnr rang his mother back and said 'I’ve killed him, he was going to get us. He will never hurt anyone again.'

When officers arrived to arrest him he added: 'They are here mum, bye mum, I’m sorry,' before the call was terminated.

Mr Hughes snr, who had been given two years to live after being diagnosed with terminal bowel cancer which had spread to his liver and lungs was pronounced dead at the scene with multiple injuries. His blood and dentures were found in the living room.

His son later claimed to police his father was a 'scary f..ked up dude' who had 'kicked off' that resulted in him giving him 'a good kicking'.

Details of the killing on March 31 emerged as Hughes jnr, of Darwen, Lancashire, was jailed for life after pleading guilty to murder. 

Preston Crown Court was told Mr Hughes snr had four children by four different women and his relationship with Susan had been volatile.

Prosecuting Miss Kate Blackwell QC said: 'His mother would often refer to Brian Hughes as “the bastard”. Feelings of resentment had bubbled under the surface with Anthony Hughes for many years.'

Hughes jnr was said to have been prone to violence himself.

The court heard he beat up and injured three of his girlfriends between 2012 and 2013.

He was given a suspended jail term but then moved in with a fourth woman only to beat her up too by pushing her into a wardrobe.

Hughes jnr was kicked out the woman’s house and went to stay with his father.

Miss Blackwell added: 'During the week before the death, he began to express frustration at living with his father and over the course of the weekend sent a series of texts to his mother, one saying, "can I kill the f..king bastard". 

'When asked why, he replied, ‘he talks a lot of sh.t’. He was reminded that he was an ill man.'

The court heard that the night before the attack Hughes jnr had asked his father for a 'moderate amount of money to have his hair cut' only to become 'furious' on finding a letter revealing Mr Hughes snr had £5,000 in his bank account.

He later arranged to meet with his half sister Miss Gosling - who had only met her father once prior, at the ICI Club where his father was drinking.

The pair arrived at the club and Miss Gosling was introduced to her father who seemingly didn’t recognise her.

The two returned to their father’s home before Mr Hughes snr returned home at around 2:45am.

The QC added: 'The deceased walked in and said something insulting to the defendant. The defendant flipped and jumped up and rushed over to where the deceased was. At no time did the deceased make any attempt to defend himself.'

During the attack Hughes jnr kicked his father to the floor and began punching him and stamping the left side of his head. 

He then walked away but a short time later returned and kicked him in the head a further 15 to 20 times using a 'lot of force.'

Post mortem tests showed Mr Hughes snr had part of his skull shattered in the beating and his face was severely fragmented.

In mitigation, defence counsel Peter Wright QC said: 'He knows and realises not only the appalling gravity of this case and the terrible loss of life and affect on others.

He admitted from the offset responsibility as he did on the night.

'His mother Susan paints a very depressing picture of the circumstances in which this man’s early childhood had been spent in a mostly unhappy environment.

'The relationship between him and his father was fractious, and punctuated with drunken arguments.

The texts showed he was frustrated and at the end of his tether with him.

'He felt routinely rejected, trivial things escalated into a full blown argument and matters came to a head. It was a lethal combination of drink and feelings of resent over all these years which poured out.'

Hughes jnr must serve 18 years eight months before being considered for parole.

Judge Anthony Russell QC said: 'For many years you had hated your father from who you were estranged following the relationship with your mother.

'Your anger boiled up fuelled by drink, insults were exchanged when he got home in the early hours and your anger turned to violence.

'He was in no position to defend himself.He was 60, in poor health with terminal cancer and his mobility was affected.

“He was particularly vulnerable and there was a considerable amount of suffering before his death.

The attack was brutal and savage and there was a degree of hatred and cruelty.'

After the case Det Insp Andy Hulme, of Lancashire Police said: 'This was a cowardly and sustained attack on an innocent man.

'Anthony Hughes has shown absolutely no regard for his father and now faces a considerable custodial sentence to consider what he has done.

'I would like to pay tribute to the stoicism of the family and friends of Brian Hughes who have been through a very difficult time but remained dignified throughout.'
