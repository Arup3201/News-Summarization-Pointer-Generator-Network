Public officials could have been behind a ‘deliberate cover-up’ of the Rotherham sex abuse scandal, MPs will warn today.

In a damning report, they call for an urgent investigation into the loss of crucial files on the abuse of at least 1,400 vulnerable young girls by mainly Asian men.

Their inquiry into the scandal heard evidence from an anonymous council researcher who had gathered evidence of failures to tackle the abuse.

Keith Vaz, chairman of the home affairs committee, has called for an 'urgent investigation' into the loss of files 

The woman claimed an unknown person stole a draft report from her office in 2002 which had been set to go to the Home Office.

There was no forced entry and access was only through key-coded and locked security doors.

Her report had contained severe criticisms of the relevant agencies in Rotherham, with the most serious alleging ‘indifference’ by senior managers.

Keith Vaz, chairman of the home affairs committee, said: ‘The proliferation of revelations about files which can no longer be located gives rise to public suspicion of a deliberate cover-up.

‘The only way to address these concerns is with a full, transparent and urgent investigation.’

One victim of men in the area, of which there are thought to be around 1,400, fell pregnant twice and tried to end her life 

The committee’s report added: ‘This is not the first case in which it has been alleged that files relating to child sexual exploitation have disappeared.’

The influential panel also demands new powers of recall for police and crime commissioners after South Yorkshire PCC Shaun Wright clung to his position for weeks before finally quitting.

The full horror of the scandal over 16 years came to light in August in the Jay Report.
