Don't give this dog a bone: Rossi gulped down the six-inch rib before his astonished owners could stop him and had to have the spare rib surgically removed

A puppy got himself into a sticky situation when he pinched a six-inch Chinese spare rib from his owner and swallowed it in one gulp.

Greedy Staffordshire bull terrier Rossi got into difficulties when the bone - which unbelievably he didn't choke on - started scratching his stomach.

Owner Steven Hawthorn, 44, said the 15-week-old puppy snatched the rib and swallowed it whole as he and his family sat down to a takeaway meal.

His wife Donna, 35, and sons Lewis, 13 and Samuel, 11, watched in amazement as Rossi, named after motorcycle legend Valentino Rossi, jumped up to nab the pork rib and devoured it in seconds.

Worried that the bone would get stuck, Mr Hawthorn, from Oldbury, West Midlands, took Rossi to the Companion Care Veterinary Surgery the next day. 

An
x-ray on January 6 revealed the large bone was scratching his stomach 
lining, which was starting to bleed and the pet was prepared for 
surgery. 

Mr Hawthorn said: 'How he managed to 
swallow such a large bone is amazing. How it didn't choke him or damage 
his aesophagus is a miracle.

Gobbled it up in one go: His owner Steven says Rossi could not resist the delicious smell of the takeaway, and ignored his usual dog food to try his luck with the takeaway

'It could have easily ruptured his 
intestines. He's lucky to be alive, a lot of things went in his favour 
and we're really glad he's still here.

'A second x-ray showed the bone had moved towards the intestines. A few more hours without the operation and he would have gone, I can't praise the vets enough.

'It was our first food treat of the year after Christmas and we were looking forward to it. But as soon as he swallowed it I knew he was in trouble.'

Sticky spare rib: The surgeons believe if they hadn't acted quickly Rossi could have died

Rossi usually only eats his favourite 
chicken flavoured dried dog biscuits but Mr Hawthorn thinks the smell of
the ribs was too much for the puppy to resist.

He
said: 'He's our first family pet and we were astonished that he would 
just wolf down something like that still being so small.

'He tends not to chew things which is maybe why he tried to eat it whole rather than nibble at it.

'He didn't show any signs of any problems at first but the day we took him to the vets he was ill.

'Rossi's running around fine now though, he's made a full recovery and playing around with the family as normal.'

Companion Care veterinary care 
assistant Cherri Wilde said it was a very rare case that dogs of any 
size swallow anything quite so large.

She said: 'Poor little Rossi swallowing an entire spare rib was a most uncommon case for us.

'If he had not undergone immediate surgery then this would most likely have been fatal for the pup.

'He
was not at all fazed by his ordeal and we are extremely happy with his 
speedy recovery and fighting spirit. He was such a brave little puppy.'
