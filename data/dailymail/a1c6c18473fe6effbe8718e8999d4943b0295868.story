The suspect in a deadly ambush on two state troopers said in a text message that 'all is good' less than five hours before he allegedly opened fire outside their barracks in northeastern Pennsylvania's Pocono Mountains, according to court documents.

Eric Frein's longtime friend received a text from the suspect around 6.15pm on Sept. 12, The Times-Tribune of Scranton reported Saturday, citing a search warrant affidavit filed in the case.

Frein is charged with ambushing the Blooming Grove barracks shortly before 11pm that night.

One trooper was shot dead and a second seriously wounded.

Authorities have been looking for Frein - described by authorities as a survivalist with a grudge against law enforcement - in the woods around his parents' home in Canadensis since the attack.

The manhunt entered its fourth week on Saturday.

Search: Hundreds of law enforcement officers have joined the search for Frein through the rugged woods

Authorities said Friday they have found caches of supplies in the rugged, heavily wooded search area.

Tuna fish, ramen noodles and other food was recovered along with clothing and 90 rounds of ammunition from a campsite where police previously said they found two pipe bombs, according to investigators.

'Because we continue to push Frein, and to seize the items he needs to survive, we believe he will be forced to search for food and shelters in other locations,' said Bivens, who gave an update on the manhunt three weeks after the shooting that killed Cpl. Bryon Dickson and seriously wounded Trooper Alex Douglass.

Court documents said Frein's wrote in his text message that he had stayed at the friend's apartment in East Stroudsburg the previous night.

The friend was in Virginia at the time of the shooting, the affidavit said.

Frein's text also said he was "heading back to Delaware," and that he would return the following week, the affidavit said.

Police have said Frein lied to relatives and other people that he was working in Delaware so he could prepare for the ambush.

Police obtained a search warrant for the apartment and recovered several boxes of ammunition and 10 dirty gun-cleaning patches, according to a document listing the items seized by police.

The friend is not charged in connection with the ambush and police have said Frein acted alone.

DNA testing, meanwhile, was inconclusive on soiled diapers thought to have been left by Frein, the FBI said Friday.

The diapers had been exposed to the elements, so 'you can't say one way or the other' whether Frein wore them, Edward Hanko, special agent in charge of the Philadelphia FBI office, said in a phone interview.

State police announced last week they had discovered diapers in the northeastern Pennsylvania woods where Frein is believed to be hiding, and that he might have worn them so he could remain stationary for long periods of time.

The diapers might have belonged to Frein, but the testing didn't confirm it or rule it out, Hanko said. 

Investigation: Authorities believe they have spotted Frein from a distance, but the rough terrain made it impossible to get to him

Frein has been described as an anti-law enforcement survivalist and expert marksman at home in the woods. He's considered armed and dangerous

Bivens said the diapers are still considered evidence in the case. He declined further comment.

The manhunt is concentrated on a heavily forested area in the Pocono Mountains. Authorities believe they have spotted Frein from a distance, but the rough terrain made it impossible to get to him. The last sighting deemed highly credible came earlier in the week, Bivens said.

Frein has been described as an anti-law enforcement survivalist and expert marksman at home in the woods. He's considered armed and dangerous.

Even as the manhunt entered its fourth week, police said they remain confident Frein will be caught.

'It's just a matter of time for him,' said Trooper Ryan Lawrence, who spent five days in the search zone. 'The commissioner down to every road trooper has the same resolve.'

Lawrence, who worked a 12-hour overnight shift on road and perimeter patrol, said the possibility that Frein was lurking somewhere nearby was never far from his mind.

'You definitely have to stay within a tactical mindset, just so you're not opening yourself up for a possible attack, at least limiting the possibility of making yourself a target,' Lawrence said Friday.

The trooper would keep himself out of the glare cast by his car's headlights, for instance, giving him the ability to observe but not easily be observed.

Lawrence lives in Lancaster, about 100 miles from the search area. Troopers throughout Pennsylvania are signing up to search for Frein, he said.

'The driving force is obviously for the family of Cpl. Bryon Dickson. It's a commonly spoken thing while there, you are doing it for him and his family,' Lawrence said. 'There's a wife and two sons who aren't able to have their state trooper come home, and that's a driving force for a lot of our guys up there.'

Pennsylvania state police have been joined by law enforcement officials from New York and New Jersey state police, the FBI, the U.S. Marshals Service and other federal agencies. The FBI alone has 140 to nearly 200 of its staff in the field each day, Hanko said, including agents, analysts, technicians, three full SWAT teams and members of a hostage rescue team.

Frein is not living off the land, Hanko said, but surviving on supplies he brought with him into the woods.

'He'll be located,' Hanko said. 'All our intel, and all of our analysis, and the sightings, and the items we've recovered that have been recently used tell us he's there.'
