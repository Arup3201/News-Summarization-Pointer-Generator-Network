Survey finds that 55 per cent of us have a pet name for our other hald, but 'darling' is the more common name in the south

'Darling' is the most common term of affection between British couples - but where you live affects your cheeky pet names, a new YouGov poll has revealed.

In total, 55 per cent of UK adults have a pet name for a loved one - with two thirds happy to say out out loud in front of friends and family.

But while people in London and the south of England were more likely to use 'darling', 'love' was the favoured term of affection in the North of England and Wales.

'Ducky' was most popular across the Midlands (10 per cent, compared to 3 per cent UK-wide), while 'sweetheart' was most commonly used in the East of England (30 per cent).

Singles in the Tyne & Wear area were the most likely to use 'pet' (17 per cent), while 22 per cent of Mancunians favour 'sexy'.

In Yorkshire, 'Love' is the favoured term of endearment, used by 31 per cent; while in Glasgow or Edinburgh you're most likely to call your loved one 'honey' or 'hun' (used by 28 per cent.)

In Merseyside, Scousers are more likely to use 'babe' or 'babes' (35 per cent); and the nickname 'baby' is most commonly used in Wales (29 per cent).

A surprisingly large number of men - 15 per cent - admit referring to their loved one as 'the boss', whilst 'her indoors' (9 per cent) and 'the ball and chain' (3 per cent) were also popular.

Some were more forgiving, with 14 per cent opting for 'my better half', the YouGov survey for Match.com of over 4,000 people found.

Females were more mild-mannered, opting for 'the hubby' (20 per cent), 'husband' (51 per cent) or 'partner' (28 per cent).

Match.com's relationship expert Kate Taylor said: 'Pet names play an important role at every stage of relationships.

'Before a couple get together, they often use fun, flirty nicknames for each other to move ahead to a more personal level of interaction. It creates a tiny shared bond.

'When dating, pet names are used to reinforce a couple's bond, both privately and to the outside world, whilst in long-term relationships, "love" or "pet" can become simple shorthand for, "I care about you."

Affectionate couples in the north refer to each other as 'love', while Ducky was popular in the Midlands and sweetheart came to in the east

'Pet names are an effective way of adding romance to everyday communications.

'The success of email-based dating websites shows us how important words are for fostering relationships, so use them!'

The research also found that single, online daters will use pet names when they start communicating with someone through a mobile dating app.

The most popular pet name to use when singles first start chatting is 'hun' or 'honey' (28 per cent) followed by 'Babe' (26 per cent), whilst 21 per cent use the term 'darling'.
