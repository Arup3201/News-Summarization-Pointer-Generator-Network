Kitted out: Team GB swimmer Amy Smith models the new swimsuit, which could give her an advantage over rivals who haven't got one

Britain’s swimmers will wear kit that could give them as much as a 2 per cent advantage over  many of their rivals in the pursuit of gold at the Olympics.

Australian swimming great Ian Thorpe – who helped to test the swimsuits – said he believed they could make a difference.

‘It might sound like a minimal advantage, but it could be significant,’ said the five-times Olympic champion, who described yesterday how he battled winds of 128km in a wind tunnel at a special testing centre in Eindhoven in the Netherlands.

It remains the personal choice of British stars such as Rebecca Adlington if they want to wear the swimsuits made by team sponsors adidas, or other brands with which they have endorsement contracts.

But adidas say up to 70 per cent of Britain’s swimmers will be wearing them and experts from the company’s 80-strong innovations department believe they could be the difference between gold and silver.

The swimsuits will also be worn by the Germans, the French and some of the Australians.

Udo Mueller, a spokesman for the adidas innovations department, said: ‘We believe we have created a suit that will give all the swimmers who wear it a big advantage.

‘We tested it against all our rivals and it absorbs 32 per cent less water than all the other manufacturers’ [kit].

‘It is also incredibly light. In 2008 in Beijing, the suit [German swimmer] Britta Steffen wore to win two gold medals was 208g. The suit she will wear here in London is under 100g.

‘In all we believe it could see a  2 per cent improvement in performance. We cannot be certain because it has never been tested in the Olympics.

‘But in testing our swimmers were very impressed. Because of the positioning of the seams, because of the material we use, because of what we call the hydrophobic finish and the way the compression aspects of the suit support the muscles, it gives the swimmers a better position in the water.

‘When Britta tested the suit she could feel the difference. As I said, it could be of huge benefit to the swimmers.’

FINA, swimming’s world governing body, banned an earlier type of special bodysuit after it contributed to the fall of several world records at the 2009 world championship in Rome.

And even though the new adidas suit complies with FINA regulations, there is clearly an advantage to be gained with the technology being used. 

Only yesterday American swimmer Ryan 
Lochte, a three-time Olympic champion and the man looking to end the 
dominance of his countryman Michael Phelps at the London Olympics, 
expressed his disappointment that some swimmers could have an edge 
because of nothing more than their brand of swimsuit.

‘If it was up to me, we would all go back to swimming in banana hammocks,’ said Lochte with a smile, before informing his audience that he was using a ‘technical term’ for the old-style briefs that are better known as Speedos. ‘That way the best swimmer would simply emerge.’

Britain’s athletes in other sports could also gain an advantage because of advanced clothing technology.

At the Tour de France Bradley Wiggins wore an adidas bodysuit that experts believe could have shaved as much as 30 seconds off his time in the final time-trial, allowing him to cement his historic win earlier this week.

The same suit will be available to Wiggins and his British cycling team-mates as they compete in the Olympics.

But is it right athletes should have an edge because of their brand of kit?
