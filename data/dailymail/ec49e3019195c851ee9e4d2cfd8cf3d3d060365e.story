Captain Hero: Simon Cowell came to the rescue whilst on holiday with ex-girlfriend, pop star Sinitta

Music mogul Simon Cowell rescued nine passengers on a sinking boat after receiving a May Day distress call.

The 52-year-old multi-millionaire leapt into action after receiving a call from another vessel off the French south coast near St Tropez.

The drama was revealed on Twitter by Cowell's ex-girlfriend, pop star Sinitta, 43, who is on holiday with the X Factor boss.

After hearing the call, he told his captain and crew to redirect his impressive boat to assist the struggling vessel, reported The Daily Star. 

When
they came nearer to the boat he sent out a smaller boat to rescue the 
passengers on board and bring them back to his vessel.

The newspaper reported that his staff also helped to pump water out of the boat.

Delivering a minute-by-minute account
Sinitta told her followers: 'Just had a mayday message, 35ft boat 
sinking. Simon has sent us to help and rescue 9 people on board!'

A few minutes later she added: 'Everyone ok, no-one hurt.

'Captain won’t let boat sink, petrol in sea etc.

'No tide, so hole plugged!'

A source told the Daily Star: 'He only did what any good person would do.

'If his yacht was in trouble he would want someone to come to his rescue. It was just lucky they happened to be close by.'

It is not the first time Cowell has 
been hailed as a hero - in February he came to the rescue of a 
father-to-be by giving him a lift home in his private jet so he could 
get to see the birth of his first child.

Drama: Simon Cowell steered to the rescue when the superyacht began to sink off the coast of Saint Tropez in southern France

Mission accomplished: All passengers and crew were saved and the boat could be repaired

Cowell
often holidays in the south of France and earlier this month he was 
spotted lapping up the French sunshine aboard a yacht.

The
music mogul was seen grinning at one point and perhaps it's because he 
could see his good friend David Walliams in the distance.

Twitter: Sinitta kept her followers up-to-date as the drama unfolded

The Little Britain star and his wife Lara Stone are also in St Tropez and were today spotted boarding Sir Elton John's yacht.

Walliams
later tweeted: 'I just mooned Simon Cowell. From a boat. That is true,'
before adding: 'And then someone a million times more well known than 
me mooned Simon Cowell too' which means he could have been referring to 
the singer himself.

Safety: None of the nine people on the vessel were injured in the dramatic accident
