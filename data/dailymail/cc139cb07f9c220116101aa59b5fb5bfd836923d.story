At 11 stone and four pounds, this obese bullmastiff weighs more than the average British woman.

Mizzy has now been checked in to an animal fit club to try and help her lose more than a third of her 72kg body weight to reach her ideal size.

The five-year-old, from Littleover in Derby, is currently so overweight that her vet now in charge of her diet can fit her over-sized dog collar around her waist.

Obese: Five-year-old bullmastiff Mizzy weighs 11 stone and four pounds - more than the average British woman

Mizzy is now so big that her over-sized collar is big enough to fit around a PDSA'a veterinary nurse's waist

Mizzy is one of 21 overweight animals - including a two-stone Norwegian Forest cat and an 11lb rotund rabbit - taking part in PDSA's six-month diet and exercise programme.

Owner Cheryl Pedley described Mizzy as
a 'giant cuddly teddy bear'. The 50-year-old said: 'We got Mizzy when 
she was a year old and she has always been a big girl, but wasn't 
overweight.

'Then in early 2011 she had pyometra - a potentially fatal womb infection - and had emergency surgery.

This
and some other health problems severely restricted her mobility and she
just piled on the pounds in just six months. She isn't given any 
naughty treats at all, just dental sticks.'

Long road ahead: Mizzy needs to lose a third of her 72kg body weight to reach he ideal size for a bullmastiff

Cause: Mizzy, from Littleover, in Derby, gained weight after having surgery on a potentially fatal womb infection

Veterinary
nurse Sue Bartlett, who is monitoring Mizzy at Derby's PDSA PetAid 
hospital, said: 'Mizzy is morbidly obese, which can have very serious 
consequences on her health and life expectancy.

'Overweight pets are less mobile, less willing to play and more likely to develop a number of serious health conditions.

'The good news is it's never too late to make a positive change and improve a pet's lifestyle. We're confident that Mizzy will have a slim-line figure and new lease of life by the end of the competition.'

Ms Pedley added: 'I knew she had gained weight but simply didn't realise how overweight she had become, I knew her breed was supposed to be big.Â 

Exercise regime: Mizzy is now on a strict diet and is being taken on lots of long walks to shift the weight

Quick nap: Owner Cheryl Pedley said Mizzy piled on the weight in just six months after her operation

'She used to love long walks so I didn't
think anything of giving her big helpings then, but I should have 
adjusted her food when her activity levels decreased - hindsight is a 
wonderful thing.

'When the vet explained the problems her extra weight was causing her I wanted to do everything I can to help her.

'I couldn't bear to lose such an adorable dog to something preventable, so I entered her into PDSA's Pet Fit Club.'

Mizzy and the other overweight animals will compete for the title of PDSA Pet Fit Club slimmer of the year.

Competitor: Mizzy is the largest pet ever to take part in Pet Fit Club - the PDSA's national slimming competition, which has been running for nearly a decade

Britain's former fattest dog Alfie weighed 12.5 stone last year - as much as Wayne Rooney before arriving at the RSPCA's door for help
