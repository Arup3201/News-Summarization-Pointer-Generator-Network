Would you wear a perfume inspired by coffee? Macmillan Cancer Support certainly hopes so after they unveiled three fragrances based on the beans ahead of a fund-raising event next week.

At the World's Biggest Coffee Morning, which will take place on the 27th of September, coffee fans will be able to snap up one of the limited edition fragrances.

Launching the scent was Miss Scotland, Jennifer Reoch, who looked stunning in a blood red dress as she posed with the unusual perfume.

Macmillan’s head of external affair, Kate Seymour, said: 'We know people love the smell of coffee so we thought, why not make a coffee-scented perfume and aftershave?

'It’s definitely unusual but we hope it will be popular with those lucky enough to get hold of one of the limited edition bottles before our World’s Biggest Coffee Morning on September 27.'

The three Macmillan scents include Coffeelicious, Macpresso and Mochamorning.

Macpresso has a more manly scent and the charity hopes it will prove popular among men who like the strong aroma of espresso or who want to appeal to women who do.

Macmillan hope to raise over £15m when over one million people take part in 120,000 coffee mornings across the UK.

In Scotland alone over 10,000 coffee mornings are planned with more than 100,000 people expected to attend, raising over £1m.
