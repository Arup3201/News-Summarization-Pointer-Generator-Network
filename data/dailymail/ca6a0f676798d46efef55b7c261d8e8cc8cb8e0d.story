Families in China have found a 'healthier' alternative to taking their children to play at the beach - bringing them to a public 'salt bath'.

Scores of families were pictured playing in 20 tons of raw salt that has been brought into a specially-built series of shallow pools in Wenling, in Zhejiang Province.

The salt is believed to help kill bacteria and make skin look younger and more healthy.

Benefits: The raw salt is believed to kill bacteria and make skin appear youthful

There may be additional reasons why parents in the coastal city would prefer their children to play indoors.

Wenling is home to a number of 
electronic waste recycling centres which have caused the earth to become
contaminated with dangerous heavy metals and persistent organic 
compounds.

The contamination means humans in the region could be exposed to lead, mercury and arsenic, among other dangerous substances.

Healing: The belief in salt's health benefits goes back to the time of the Ancient Greeks

However sea salt has been used as a 
healing substance since the time of the Ancient Greeks, when Hippocrates
noticed fishermen who soaked their cuts in seawater were more likely to
heal swiftly.

Studies in the 1980s showed patients 
with joint problems, skin complaints and problems sleeping all benefited
from bathing in sea salt.

It is believed the salt helps restore the body's mineral balance when it is absorbed through the skin.

Potassium in salt helps skin look 
healthy and boosts energy levels, while sodium helps keep the immune 
system healthy. Salt also contains bromides which help muscles relax and
heal.
