A limp and lifeless Queens Park Rangers were destroyed by Crystal Palace, leaving their Barclays Premier League future severely in doubt.

In a first half of utter domination the home side went three goals ahead with only three shots on target, while QPR failed to muster a single one.

Already three points adrift of safety ahead of kick-off, QPR manager Chris Ramsey knew how imperative it was to get something from this game. His players did not respond.

The first came after 21 minutes, Yannick Bolasie bursting down the left, easily past 19-year-old right-back Darnell Furlong, and sending a low ball across the box which Wilfried Zaha was able to slide in at the back post. 

He was almost split in two by the upright in the process, and was eventually substituted in the second half, given a standing ovation by the adoring Selhurst Park crowd for netting his first goal since making a permanent move back to south London in January.

‘If it meant colliding with the post, I had to get my goal,’ said Zaha, who had gingerly limped off, afterwards. ‘It will definitely hurt, but no pain, no gain.

‘We’ve been talking all week about getting into the box so as soon as Yannick got the ball I knew I had to get in there and get on the end of it.’

It took another 20 minutes for the second, Bolasie again simply out-pacing Furlong down the left and crossing low again. This time goalkeeper Rob Green got a hand to the ball but could not divert it out of the path of James McArther who finished into the open net. 

Matt Phillips unleashed a ferocious strike from 40 yards that found the top corner to pull a goal back for the visitors

Bolasie’s relentless dismantling of teenager Furlong was painful to watch, like a grown man putting a puppy into a sack and repeatedly kicking it.

But he was afforded some respite, at least, for the third, just 60 seconds later this time. Palace probed down the other flank, Zaha using skill to outwit a few QPR players before passing into Joel Ward who took a touch before bending the ball through a flurry of players and bouncing agonisingly into the far left of goal.

Furlong, playing only his third game for QPR, was hooked at half-time, Clint Hill coming in at centre-back and Nedum Onuoha moving to right-back to try to deal with Bolasie’s threat.

QPR manager Chris Ramsey claimed it was due to injury. ‘Darnell came off for no other reason that he’s got a bad calf,’ he said. ‘His calf stiffened up and it wouldn’t be fair to the boy to keep the boy on there hobbling.’

If Darnell was the puppy of the side, his team-mates finally produced some bite in the second half, even if it was all too late.

They finally got an effort on target, after 72 minutes. From who else but Charlie Austin? The striker reached a cross first but could only direct at tame header down the middle which Palace goalkeeper Julian Speroni held.

Then, out of nowhere, they pulled one back in the final 10 minutes, with one of the strikes of the season. Matt Phillips picked the ball up in the middle of the park and took a touch before belting an effort over Speroni and into the top left corner from 40 yards.

With one minute remaining of the 90 he almost struck again, this time hitting a first-time drive from slightly to the right of goal, but Speroni was alert and dived to push it wide.

Palace manager Alan Pardew is targeting finishing above former club Newcastle, who he left in a shock move in December but has since reeled them to within reach.

‘I said to the players when I arrived to look above because if you look below there is anxiety and pressure,’ Pardew revealed. ‘You can't play like that.

‘You have to try to Newcastle, whoever is above us. We're above Everton, that was a bit of goal for us. Can we stay above them?’

But time is running out for QPR to stay in the league. ‘I’m hoping nine games is enough,’ Ramsey added. ‘That’s all that I’ve got, so we’ll go for it as best we can.

‘They’re still unified in what we’re trying to do, and all we can do really is to keep fighting.’

Even getting a stunning consolation goal flattered QPR at the final whistle and the fight is beginning to drain from them.
