MasterChef host Gregg Wallace faces a grilling by ‘very senior’ BBC staff after his recent bar fight, leaving his future on the show in doubt.

The Mail on Sunday understands high-level managers at the Corporation are ‘very concerned’ following the incident in which he struck magazine publisher Paul Bates five times during a £225-a-head function at a Worcestershire hotel last weekend.

‘I wouldn’t be surprised if he was out of job after all of this,’ said one insider.

Wallace, who enjoys a six-figure salary for his role on MasterChef, claimed afterwards that he did ‘what any man would do’ saying his girlfriend Anne-Marie Sterpini, 27, was ‘disrespected’.

Mr Bates insists the pair were simply ‘chatting’ and says he was attacked ‘out of the blue’.

Wallace has a history of aggressive behaviour in public, which is likely to concern BBC bosses further as they prepare to speak to the TV chef.

In 2007 the 48-year-old Londoner accepted an official police caution after a row over  a taxi, which left nurse Tony O’Ceallaigh ‘incredibly bruised’.

Sources close to the presenter this week told The Mail on Sunday how the cookery expert has a tendency to ‘get jealous easily’.

The close friend said: ‘There was no surprise to me when news of this latest fight came out this week. It’s not the first time something like this has happened.’

Another source told how he was once ejected from a Surrey hotel after he became embroiled in a row.

Wallace’s spokesman said after the latest incident: ‘I can confirm Gregg was involved in a disagreement. The situation was swiftly resolved.’

He said yesterday: ‘About 15 years ago, Gregg was staying at a huge hotel where a Freemason event was taking place. At the end of the night, he had trouble finding his room.

‘After three attempts, Gregg became very frustrated and pulled a member of staff from behind a desk to help direct him to his room. Before lunchtime the next day, hotel staff asked him to leave.’

Wallace has been married three times and has two children from his second marriage.

His second and third wives have previously labelled him ‘difficult’, while another recent girlfriend, model Carla Franco, told how he criticised her over her weight.
