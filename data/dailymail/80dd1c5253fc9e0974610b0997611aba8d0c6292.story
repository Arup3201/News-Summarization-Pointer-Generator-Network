He got very publicly naked in Las Vegas and was last seen twerking on a yacht in Abu Dhabi. So it might be thought that Prince Harry has very few secrets left to reveal.

But the fourth in line to the throne admitted today that he still gets ridiculously nervous when asked to speak publicly.

Harry, 30, was confessing all in his role as founder of Sentebale, the charity he set up in 2006 to help children afflicted by HIV and Aids in the poverty-stricken African kingdom of Lesotho.

Terrifying: Prince Harry has revealed that he gets 'ridiculously nervous' about public speaking

Speaking out: Harry hopes the campaign will encourage AIDS sufferers to seek the help they need

Part of a social media campaign to mark World Aids Day, #FeelNoShame aims to encourage celebrities and members of the public to share their deepest secret in a bid to highlight the shame that prevents many HIV sufferers from seeking help.

In his video clip, which can be viewed online, the royal says: 'On today, World Aids Day, my secret is, believe it or not, I get incredibly nervous before public speaking, no matter how big the crowd or the audience.

'Despite the fact that I laugh and joke all the time, I get incredibly nervous, if not anxious, actually, before going into rooms full of people when I am wearing a suit.

‘And now I have confessed that I’ll probably be even more worried that people are looking at me. ‘

The prince’s secret, while not exactly revelatory, is surprising as he has become an increasingly assured speaker with a developing public role in recent years.

Over the summer he launched the inspiring Invictus Games for injured servicemen as with a moving speech in front of thousands and ad-libbed to a sell-out crowd in the Queen Elizabeth Olympic Park at a closing concert.

No fear: Despite Harry's claims, he has proved an assured public speaker - notably at the Invictus Games 

Campaign: Harry's revelations came as part of a social media campaign for his charity Sentebale

Celebrities supporting the initiative included Nicole Scherzinger, who said: ‘My secret is sometimes I don’t feel like I’m enough, I’m worth it and I don’t fit in but #feelnoshame.’

Boxer Ricky Hatton said; ‘My secret is a big embarrassing in that when I was one years of age my next door neighbour’s cat had just take it upon itself to scratch me down my face and taken near enough half my skin off.

‘Ever since that day I have been scared of cats and whenever one comes across my path now I’m petrified of them. I know it’s a bit strange a secret like that coming from a world champion but I am absolutely scared and terrified of cats.’

Singer Joss Stone also admitted – rather too candidly, perhaps: ‘When I was 11 I drank rather too much tea when I was out with my mum and then I went into Superdrug [the chemist] and weed myself. 

'Now, today, I cannot stop at a service station, at a petrol station, without going to the loo even though I don’t need the loo. I still go. It’s ingrained in my brain, I know it won’t happen again but I feel no shame.’

Africa: Sentebale's work focuses on helping those with HIV and AIDS in the tiny country of Lesotho

Stigma: The new campaign aims to encourage sufferers to speak up and get the help they need

On a different tack, actress Gemma Arterton admitted she had never seen Star Wars.

The campaign, which was created by charity Sentebale – which Prince Harry co-founded – aims to raise awareness of how eradicating this shame and stigma can save the lives of HIV sufferers, empowering them to seek medical support and education about their condition, and preventing the virus from spreading.

In a video released to mark the start of the initiative, the prince said: ‘Globally, HIV is the second highest cause of death amongst those aged between 10-19 years old, and it is the number one cause of death across Africa.

'One tragic issue in particular is the shame and stigma linked to HIV. This causes thousands of children to needlessly die each year because they’re keeping their illness a secret and not getting the medical attention they need.

‘To show our support for the children of Lesotho [where Sentebale works], and help reduce the stigma for all those affected by HIV, we are turning this World AIDS Day into a day in which no one should feel any shame about their secrets. 

'Together, we can tackle the stigma surrounding HIV and give the young people carrying it the childhood they deserve. The childhood so many of us take for granted.’

Secret: Joss Stone also revealed her deepest secret - that she once wet herself in Superdrug aged 11

Revelations: Gemma Arterton has never seen Star Wars while Ricky Hatton was once scratched by a cat

Cathy Ferrier, CEO of Sentebale, said: ‘This World AIDS Day Sentebale is launching an important campaign. Too many children are not receiving the treatment and care they so desperately need due to the stigma attached to HIV.

'Today we will celebrate the sharing of secrets with #FeelNoShame, to help spread the word that eradicating the stigma surrounding HIV will help save the lives of many HIV-positive children.’

Prince Harry co-founded Sentebale in 2006 with Prince Seeiso of Lesotho, following a visit to the country two years earlier, when he was struck by the effect the HIV/AIDS pandemic was having on the country, particularly its children.

Lesotho has the third highest HIV/AIDS prevalence in the world. More than 37,000 of Lesotho’s 500,000 children are HIV positive, and approximately 200,000 have lost parents to AIDS, forcing them out of school and into hazardous forms of labour including prostitution and trafficking. 

Since 1996, the country’s average life expectancy has fallen from 59 years to below 48.7 years.

Sentebale provides accommodation, hot food, access to medication and education for Lesotho’s children – preventing the virus from spreading – as well as vital psycho-social support to help them tackle stigma and cope with the emotional repercussions of their condition and live normal lives.

It also encourages children and young people to come together through week-long Mamohato camps and regular clubs, to talk about their health issues and fears of living with HIV. 

Often for the first time they learn to talk openly to one another about being HIV-positive, learning about their medication, building friendships and a sense of normality, as they realise that, with the correct medication, it is possible to lead a long and healthy life.
