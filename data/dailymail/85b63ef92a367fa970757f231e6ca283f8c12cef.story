The woman who was dramatically photographed as she was beaten stripped and beaten senseless by Egyptian soldiers does not want to come forward because she is ashamed by her treatment.

Footage and stills of the woman being beaten to the ground, kicked and stamped on as her hijab was torn off in Tahrir Square have made front page news around the world.

Moments earlier, she had been struck countless times on the head and body with metal batons by a ten-strong mob before losing consciousness and slumping to the floor.

Soldiers then continued the assault, revealing her bra after her abaya was virtually pulled off during the assault.

Hassan Mahmoud, a journalist for the newspaper Al Badeel, was near the woman as she stumbled and was then set upon by military police.

He told The Guardian: 'They wanted to take her away from us but then a few brave protesters came in and started hurling stones and that was the one thing that saved her from their hands.'

The unnamed woman was treated for hand and leg injuries, before she was taken home where she is said to have been left feeling wretched after her ordeal.

Mr Mahmoud said she told him: 'It doesn't matter if I talk [to the media] or not, their stripping me is enough to reveal them and tell enough to those who still believe them.'

Mohamed Zeidan, who filmed the shocking beating from a balcony overlooking Tahrir Square, said he stopped recording out of fear of being discovered.

'The army were like vultures who found a prey,' he said. 'The soldiers even beat an older couple who tried to help her up.'

Khadiga al-Hennawy can be seen being dragged by the hair by two officers, before being kicked and beaten around the arms and back with batons.

Known as the 'mother of revolutionaries' because she has taken part in several protests against the Supreme Council of the Armed Forces.

Clashes: Protesters brave water cannons during a stand off in the square. A total of 14 people have been killed in four days of violent demonstrations

Hundreds of soldiers wearing riot gear have today carried out further sweeps through Cairo's Tahrir Square and opened fire on protesters demanding an end to military rule.

The Health Ministry said at least three people were killed - bringing the death toll for four days of violent clashes to 14.

Clashes have been raging in the capital since Friday, when military forces guarding the Cabinet building near the square cracked down on a three-week sit-in to demand ruling generals immediately hand over power to a civilian authority.

The raid may have been an attempt by the military to keep protesters away from key government buildings near the square, including parliament and the Interior Ministry - in charged of the police force.

Victims: Two boys show ammunition, including bullets and tear gas canisters, used during the clashes

A member of the ruling military council defended the use of force, and argued the events amounted to an attempt to 'topple the state'.

Major General Adel Emara said: 'There is a methodical and prepared plot to topple the state, but Egypt will not fall.

'What are we supposed to do when protesters break the law? Should we invite people from abroad to govern our nation?'

The military council took power 10 months ago after the popular uprising forced longtime president Hosni Mubarak to step down.

It has routinely denied the use of excessive force by its troops against protesters, including clashes last month that left more than 40 people dead.

Islamist parties won the largest share of the vote in the first round of parliament elections.
