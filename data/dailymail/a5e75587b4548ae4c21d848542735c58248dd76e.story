The shaking of Welsh heads said it all. Warren Gatland’s side trudged off the field at the Millennium Stadium after a victory that felt more like defeat.

Such a performance against the All Blacks next week will only end one way. The Kiwis will provide a far more brutal assessment of Welsh mettle than this spirited Fijian bunch who survive on a shoe-string budget and almost snatched a famous victory – despite playing just under half an hour with 14-men after a red card to Campese Ma’afu.

If Warren Gatland and his selection panel were using this fixture as a trial ahead of the New Zealand Test, then only full back Liam Williams put his hand up. Too many of his colleagues in the red jersey were anonymous and the big guns – notably Sam Warburton and Alun Wyn Jones – will be welcomed back to the starting XV with open arms.

‘It had the potential to be a bit of a blowout but ended up being a dogfight,’ said Gatland. ‘There was a big opportunity for a number of players in terms of stepping up and putting a marker down.

‘Now we’ve got to look forwards and be excited about next week. The All Blacks made 13 changes for Scotland and they will probably make another 13 changes against us. They will come fully loaded.’

Whether Gloucester hooker Richard Hibbard will be among those retuning remains unclear. The British Lion left camp in a protective boot on Tuesday but declared himself fit to play against Harlequins on Friday night. His decision riled the Welsh coaches and stern words will be had tomorrow morning.

‘He was in a boot earlier in the week and wasn’t available for selection, so he needs to go back to Gloucester,’ said Gatland. ‘It was a surprise to us that, on Wednesday, he presents himself to Gloucester as being fit to go on the bench. Sometimes the player needs to be stronger and that’s the conversation we’ll have next week.’

His jersey was filled by Scott Baldwin and the Ospreys hooker triggered the line-out that set up the opening try. Wales dominated the catch and drive throughout, a rare positive from the performance, and provided the platform for the first try from George North in the seventh minute.

Rhys Priestland missed the kick and it was not the nerve-settler the Wales No 10 had hoped for, following the booing of the low-confidence player against Australia last week. His dropped ball five minutes later almost allowed Fiji through to level the score, but the presence of North was enough to force a knock on from 6ft5in winger Waisea Nayacalevu.

Wales survived and within the opening quarter they were two tries ahead. Mike Phillips took a quick penalty and it was finished by Alex Cuthbert.. Then any structure in play quickly disintegrated.

Fiji have become the forgotten team in the ‘group of death’, but there were reminders in Cardiff that they should not be taken lightly. In the first half, they won eight turnovers to nil against the hosts and, following a snipe from scrum half Nikola Matawalu, they narrowed the deficit with two penalties from giant centre Nemani Nadolo.

‘We’ve only been together for a short time but we’ll have a 35-day camp leading up to the World Cup,’ said Fiji coach John McKee. ‘We will get better and better with the more time we spend together.’

It was a closer contest than many had expected. Fiji had limited preparation and their squad, many of whom smoke, earn just £80 a day while playing in the white jersey. Next week’s opponents, New Zealand, pocket more than £1,000 a day on their tour of the northern hemisphere. They almost narrowed the deficit even further, but Nadolo scuffed his third kick on goal.

Campese Ma’afu, the younger brother younger brother of Wallaby prop Salesi, was shown a yellow card in the 37th minute. The 20-stone forward hit the side of a driving maul and a penalty try was awarded to leave the half time score at 17-6.

The Islanders managed not to concede during Ma’afu’s sin-bin period, after his re-introduction, the Nottingham player was shown a second yellow for taking out Bradley Davies at the lineout. Fiji put up a spirited resistance with 14-men and, after Taulupe Faletau’s try was overruled, Nadolo landed one last blow with an 80-metre interception try to set up a twitchy finale.
