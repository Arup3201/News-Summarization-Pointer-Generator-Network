Former Brazil international Juninho will join the BBC's World Cup coverage as a pundit.

The 41-year-old, who lifted the World Cup with his country in 2002, earned huge popularity in England during three spells with Middlesbrough and his opinions on the tournament in his homeland will add valuable insight.

He joins Thierry Henry and Rio Ferdinand as big names lined up by the Corporation.

Juninho earned fame on these shores when was he signed by Boro boss Bryan Robson in October 1995 for £4.75million in a huge coup for the club, where he is considered one of the all-time greats.

He had won the Copa Libertadores with Sao Paolo and was wanted by top European sides but moved to Teesside as part of an exciting team funded by owner Steve Gibson.

Juninho's diminutive stature - he is only 5ft 5in - meant he became known as 'The Little Fella', while stories of him playing football in the streets with local children earned him great favour.

On the pitch he was an instant success in an attacking role and in the 1996-97 helped Boro to both the League Cup and FA Cup finals, and came runner-up to Gianfranco Zola in the voting for the FWA's Footballer of the Year.

But he was unable to stop Robson's team being relegated from the Premier League after a three-point deduction and was reduced to tears on the final day of the season after a 1-1 draw with Leeds United confirmed the drop. 

A £12million sale to Atletico Madrid followed but a broken leg ruined his chances of making the Brazil squad for France 98 and he returned to Boro on loan for the 1999-2000 season, playing alongside Paul Gascoigne and Paul Ince as the side finished 12th.

There were more loan spells with Vasco Da Gama and Flamengo which in 2002 earned him a spot in Luiz Felipe Scolari's World Cup squad. Juninho started all three group games and the last-16 tie against Belgium but lost his place to Kleberson for the quarter-final victory over England.

He came on as a substitute in the 85th minute of the 2-0 final win over Germany.

That summer, aged 29, he re-joined a Boro team managed by Steve McClaren in a £6m deal.

Two consecutive 11th placed finishes followed as well as his first trophy in English football with the 2004 League Cup.

He played in the 2-1 final win over Bolton Wanderers at the Millenium Stadium and has said that trophy rivals the World Cup because of his major role.

'I always said this title means a lot to me, especially when you feel a real part of winning the title,' he said.

Juninho then signed Celtic for a season before returning to Brazil as well as spending one campaign at Sydney FC.

It is his time on Teesside for which he will be best remembered. In all he played 155 games for Boro, scoring 33 goals and winning many more plaudits. He also won 49 international caps and scored five goals.
