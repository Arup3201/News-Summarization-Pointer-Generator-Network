The latest intake of Metropolitan Police officers today passed out in front of Boris Johnson and Commissioner Bernard Hogan-Howe. 

But the mayor and police chief may have been less than impressed by the lack of Black and Minority Ethnic candidates on the parade ground. 

Having set an  ambitious target of having 40 per cent of all officers from Black and Minority Ethnic backgrounds, only 18 per cent met that criteria.

Mayor of London Boris Johnson and Commissioner Bernard Hogan-Howe both attended today's ceremony and praised the growing number of non-white officers within the force, despite missing their own diversity target by more than 50 per cent. 

Only 39 of the 216 officers graduating from Hendon Police Training College were from BME backgrounds, despite the Metropolitan Police accepting that at least 40 per cent - or 86 officers should have been from non-white backgrounds.

According to a report published by the London Assembly Police and Crime Committee in December 2014, before the most recent recruitment campaign, only 11 per cent of officers serving in the Met were from Black, Asian and Minority Ethnic background, compared with approximately 40 per cent of the population of London. The current BME figure in the Met is now 12 per cent.

Only three per cent of female officers with the Met are from minority backgrounds. 

Mayor Johnson today said that the number of BME officers in the Met has increased to 12 per cent. In an effort to boost BME numbers in the force, the Metropolitan Police is only considering applications from candidates who live within the Greater London area.

Only 12 per cent of officers serving with the Met are currently from a BME background 

Since this policy has been introduced, 35 per cent of people who have expressed an interest in joining the Met have been from a BME background. 

Mayor Johnson said: 'London is one of the most diverse cities in the world and we are now beginning to see the creation of a police force that truly reflects the city that it serves. 

'By taking tough decisions on the budget, we've been able to recruit additional officers and put more of them out on the streets, driving down crime and keeping Londoners safe. 

'There's more to be done but with more officers from every community in the capital, using the best technology we can provide, I believe we are well on the way to creating the force we need to tackle 21st century crime and protect London for years to come.'

The new recruits have boosted the strength of the Met to almost 32,000 despite significant budget pressure

Metropolitan Police Commissioner Bernard Hogan Howe said: 'Today we're celebrating reacting the target we set of 32,000 officers, the most we've had since the Olympics. 

'Other forces have had to cut their numbers, but the Met has worked hard to find savings and protect the frontline. 

'This will continue to be our approach. 

'I'm pleased to have more officers from minorities joining the Met and pleased by the rise in female officers too. We'll keep working hard to reflect the London we serve.'
