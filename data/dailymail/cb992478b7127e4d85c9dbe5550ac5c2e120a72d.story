'Kenneth should be required to pay monthly child support to cover all of the children's expenses, fixed overhead expenses for the household, as well as child care, security, household and administrative staff, who should be reporting to Anne and under her control, not Kenneth's,' Dias Griffin said in her filing, which was obtained by the Chicago Tribune. 

A rep for Griffin said the money man 'focused on the well-being of his children, and that has guided his every decision.'

They then added; 'He has willingly paid all reasonable, and frankly, many unreasonable expenses throughout the separation, including millions in cash to Anne and a $10 million gift to Harvard in Anne's name. But when Anne takes things to a ridiculous level of extravagance and demands things like a $450,000 vacation to St. Bart's, enough is enough.'

Griffin, who is fighting to only pay his wife what the two agreed on in their pre-nup as part of a messy divorce, says his estranged spouse has already received $35 million in the break-up.

The CEO of $20 billion Chicago-based investment giant Citadel LLC  agreed to pay his wife $25 million in their prenup, plus $1 million for each year they were married.

Having split after 11 years, Anne Dias Griffin has already accrued $35 million and has a reported net worth of $50 million, according to the newspaper.

However the settlement would leave her with no real estate titles or any of the couple's costly possessions, including an extensive art collection. 

Last year, Griffin hired a lawyer to represent his three young children in the settlement.

He is trying to ensure his family remain in Chicago, while his wife intends to move to New York.

She is seeking full-time custody.

Griffin's worth is estimated to be around $5.6 billion.

He founded the hedge fund Citadel LLC in 1990.

Dias Griffin claims she was coerced into signing the prenup, and has filed a petition with the court saying she did not have a chance to fully read the document before agreeing to it back in 2003.

Their wedding ceremony took place in Versailles, France, as a two-day blowout that featured performances by Cirque du Soleil and  Donna Summer.

As it pertains to the three minor children, ages six, four and two, Mrs. Dias-Griffin in seeking sole custody with 'reasonable visitation,' while her husband is asking for joint custody.

In most divorce cases, support payments vary based on custody arrangements. 

Chicago lawyer Joel Levin of Levin & Associates to has been chosen to serve as 'guardian ad litem' for the couple's kids.

The duties of the guardian ad litem include investigating the facts of the case, interviewing the children, their parents, and other relevant parties, and submitting a written report to the court.

Levin has previously worked with the children of famous actors and athletes.

Mr. Griffin filed for divorce in July of this year while his wife was on vacation in London with the children.

He and his wife had been separated since February 2012.

Mrs. Dias-Griffin was a prominent name in the financial world herself, starting Aragon Global Management, LLC in 2001. 

She left in 2009 however to focus on her family.

Among the real estate  holdings Mrs. Dias-Griffin does not have any claim to according to the prenup are a $15 million penthouse condo at the Park Tower in Chicago, four Palm Beach properties worth $130 million, and a vast Balinese-style, beach-front property at the Hualalai resort in Hawaii which was purchased in 2011 for around $17 million.
