Manchester City have released a matchday app that gives their fans the ability to watch instant highlights, access live stats and even rewind live video streams.

The app, which will be available for the upcoming Manchester derby, boasts features that include match commentary, pre and post-match interviews, goal highlights, an elevated camera view of the match and even the ability to rewind any live in-stadium video stream by 30 seconds.

Due to issues with Premier League television rights, however, some of the features of CityMatchday will only be available from inside the stadium.  

Manchester City have released a new matchday app with a host of new features for their fans

Some features will only be available for fans who are inside the stadium watching the game

Manchester City's director of media and fan relationship management, Diego Gigliani, said:

'Football is much more than just the 90 minutes on the pitch. The matchday ritual begins for many fans the moment they wake up in the morning. 

'The anticipation during the build up to the game and the emotions afterwards are what makes it so special. This is what we wanted to try and capture and share with our fans, wherever they're supporting us from.

'As a club, we have always prided ourselves on digital innovation and continually trying to push the boundaries of what is possible to ensure our fans have a great time supporting their team. This philosophy not only lies at the heart of our fan engagement, but also our aim to create the world's most immersive digital matchday experience.'

The app will allow fans to access stats during the game which will be updated as the match progresses

Fans will be able to rewind live in-stadium video channels and watch anything they may have missed
