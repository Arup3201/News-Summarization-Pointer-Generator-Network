Yaya Toure's father insists the Manchester City star will stay with the Premier League champions despite his threat to quit the Etihad this summer.

Toure and his agent Dimitry Seluk hit out at City for failing to make more of an effort to celebrate the Ivory Coast midfielder's 31st birthday on the club's end-of-season trip to Abu Dhabi.

Seluk accused City of treating his client 'like a nobody' and claimed that he would be interested in a return to his old club Barcelona.

Eyes on the prize: Toure is set to stay at Manchester City next season, according to the midfielder's father

Toure, who is 12 months into a four-year deal worth in excess of £200,000-a-week, has said that he will make a statement after the World Cup but his father Mory has reassured City that he will stay at the club.

'No, he won't leave and it's not even my wish that he leaves Manchester City,' he said.

'It's said that the most wished for changes bring their sadness. And I reconfirm that he won't leave.

'If Yaya wanted Manchester City to pay particular attention to the date of his birthday, it's because he felt that it was the right moment for the club to show him their consideration for all the sacrifices made for City to be at this level.

'It's a situation he didn't appreciate. And as he's a boy who doesn't keep his frustrations to himself, he preferred to express himself. But I think it's a situation which will be resolved.'
