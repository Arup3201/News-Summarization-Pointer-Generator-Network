A former Penn State footballer who was paralysed from the neck down after a fall during a game has been elected to the New Jersey Assembly.

Determined not to let his injury beat him, Adam Taliaferro spent eight months learning to walk again after he was paralysed from the neck down. 

He was told he had just a three per cent chance of walking on his own again and beat the odds to begin calling for changes to help others who had become injured in similar accidents.

Adam Taliaferro was given a three per cent chance he would ever walk again after he suffered serious spinal cord injuries on the football field and has now overcome the odds and been elected to the Jersey Assembly 

It was this desire that led Taliaferro, now 33, to become an 'accidental politician' - first being advised to become a county freedolder in 2011 to help more people. And now he has been sworn in to replace an Assembly member in New Jersey who stepped down.

Taliaferro was paralyzed from the neck down in 2000 and given little chance of ever walking again.

'It 100 percent changed me,' Taliaferro said. 'Before my injury what was important to me was my family but also football — it was my dream to play in the NFL. It really teaches you to appreciate everything.'

Taliaferro was sent dozens of donations to pay for care to help his rehabilitation but decided to instead use the money to establish a foundation to give emotional and financial help to people with similar injuries. So far, the Adam Taliaferro Foundation has distributed more than $1 million to those who have suffered similar accidents. 

'Everyone that we help I see myself in them,' he said. 'My biggest thought is I want everyone to have the same chance of recovery I had.'

Senate President Steve Sweeney became aware of the foundation and put Taliaferro on the path to this political career. He told him he could help more people as an elected official and encouraged him to run for Gloucester County freeholder as a Democrat.

From here he has gone from strength to strength and after November plans to apply to be elected full term to the Assembly. 

In September 2000 trainers anxiously examined Penn State cornerback Adam Taliaferro after he was injured in the fourth quarter of a game against Ohio State, in Columbus, Ohio. He was temporarily paralysed

Taliaferro was born in Pittsburgh, but moved to Voorhees, New Jersey, as a child. After attending Eastern High School, he had scholarship offers from 30 universities to play football but the choice came down to Penn State and Tennessee.

The decisive factor, he said, was that Penn State was close enough to home for his parents to come watch him play.

He was just five games into his freshman season when he was injured while making a tackle against Ohio State. He remembers thinking he had only hurt his arm when he couldn't lift it after the play, but knew something serious happened when he couldn't move his leg.

Adam Taliaferro used money donated to him to help with his own care to set up a foundation to help others 

He was given just a three percent chance of ever walking again, but the immediate medical attention he received on the field and physical conditioning helped his recovery, he said. 

Though he would never play football again, Taliaferro graduated from Penn State in 2005 and the Rutgers Camden School of Law. 

In addition to his blossoming political career, he is a health care policy analyst at Bristol-Myers Squibb — and a Penn State trustee.

Taliaferro was a cornerback for Penn State team 

Tom Bradley, who was Penn State's defensive coordinator during Taliaferro's career, said he saw a student athlete with tremendous potential.

'So smart, you could tell he was mentally ahead of where the other guys were,' said Bradley, now an assistant at West Virginia.

Bradley said he wasn't sure how his and Taliaferro's political views might align — Bradley declined to say where he falls on the political spectrum— but he said he was confident in Taliaferro.

'He'll do the right thing,' Bradley said. 'I know him

Celeste Riley, who previously held the post, said the position on the Assembly is likely to be a challenging one for Taliaferro because of the diversity of the population. 

But she said she thought his own experience would help him to succeed.  

'I think he'll do it. He's a hard worker and people like to have an example of what it means to work hard and face adversity,' she said.
