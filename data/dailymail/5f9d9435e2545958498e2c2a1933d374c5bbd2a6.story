Smokers would be forced to light up inside their apartments and townhouses with the windows and doors closed under a controversial new proposal to ban cigarettes on balconies in Queensland.

The state's Attorney-General Jarrod Bleijie is conducting a review into body corporate laws, which tackles the issue of 'smoke drift'.

The paper proposes a no smoking by-law to prohibit lighting up on a balcony in an outside area where the smoke drifts into another person's residence, including in courtyards.

'In other words, the lot owner may only be free to smoke inside their own lot with the windows and doors shut,' the report states.

'Owners and occupiers… find themselves with very little that can be done if the smoke from a neighbouring lot or balcony drifts into their windows and doors.'

Mr Bleijie has invited the 400,000 Queenslanders who live in a unit or townhouse to make submissions in the review, with the deadline to make a comment set for January 30.

'It's an opportunity for people involved in bodies corporate to have their say on important issues affecting the liveability of body corporate schemes throughout Queensland,' he said.

Tenants Queensland state-wide coordinator Penny Carr said it was a 'tricky issue'.

'People should be free to do what they want to do in their own home,' Ms Carr said.

'But if it has impact on other residents there needs to be compromise.'

In Queensland, smoking is already banned anywhere within four metres of an entrance to a non-residential building, at sporting stadiums, in outdoor eating and drinking areas, near outdoor children's playground equipment and in cars carrying children under 16 years old.

The body corporate law review also tackles issues such as unauthorised parking, pets and overcrowding during Schoolies.
