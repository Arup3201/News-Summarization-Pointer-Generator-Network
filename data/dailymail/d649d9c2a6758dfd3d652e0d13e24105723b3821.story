Susan Thornton, 48, had nine episodes (in which she was rushed off to A&E to treat her chest pains and breathlessness) before it was revealed she has Conn's syndrome

High blood pressure affects around ten million people in the UK. Dubbed the silent killer, the condition is often symptomless yet is a leading cause of stroke, which strikes around 150,000 Britons every year and kills 40,000.

The condition is defined as having blood pressure readings above 140/90 - and the risk of stroke doubles with every 20 point rise in systolic blood pressure above 115 (this is the top number and measures the blood pressure during every heartbeat - the bottom number, diastolic, is the blood pressure between beats).

Because of the considerable risk of stroke, high blood pressure must be immediately treated when diagnosed. Patients can be prescribed medications such as beta-blockers, and given lifestyle advice about cutting salt in the diet and taking regular exercise.

However, for one in five patients with high blood pressure, the pills are of little help, and do not lower their readings, despite doctors trying them on numerous medications.

This 'resistant hypertension' is not only frustrating for patients, it can also have disastrous consequences, as their stroke risk remains high. Yet doctors have previously been at a loss to how to treat these resistant cases.

'We owe it to patients to make sure their unexplained hypertension is investigated,' says Morris Brown, professor of clinical pharmacology at Cambridge University, who is a consultant at the city's Addenbrooke's Hospital.

But recent findings suggest our hormones may be to blame - specifically one called aldosterone. This controls salt levels in the blood, and too much of the hormone can lead to high salt levels and high blood pressure.

Now scientists have realised some people who do not respond to blood pressure pills have small non-cancerous growths on their adrenal glands, which produce aldosterone.

These glands sit on top of the kidneys and  are also crucial for producing adrenaline and various other hormones. When the glands develop these growths, they start to overproduce aldosterone. This causes high salt levels in the blood and sends blood pressure soaring.

This condition is called Conn's syndrome, and may affect up to one in four people with treatment-resistant high blood pressure, says Professor Brown.

He explains that too much aldosterone also causes levels of the mineral potassium to drop, and sufficient amounts of this mineral are essential for keeping blood pressure low.

'Instead of getting rid of salt, the body hangs on to it in exchange for potassium - the very mineral needed to balance and normalise blood pressure - which is pushed out of the body, so exacerbating the problem.'

Charles Payne had been taking high doses of six different blood pressure drugs daily for almost ten years before it was discovered his hypertension was hormonal

It can also cause tiredness and lethargy because of the low potassium levels, as this mineral is needed to keep muscles functioning properly. But the condition is under-recognised by doctors, leaving patients trying one drug after another without benefit.

This happened to Susan Thornton, whose high blood pressure was diagnosed only after a routine check-up with her GP.  She says: 'The doctor didn't tell me what the reading was, just that it was above average and, though I didn't need to take a drug, he suggested more exercise.'

This was three years ago, and Susan, then 45, took her GP's advice. 'I started swimming daily and felt better, until one afternoon when driving to collect my then partner from work. I suddenly felt extremely ill and had to pull over.

'I had mild chest pains and was breathless and feared something was happening to my heart.'

Susan, a mother-of-four from March in Cambridgeshire, called an ambulance and was rushed to her local hospital. En route, her blood pressure read 200/104. By the time she arrived at A&E, it had gone off the digital scale.

However, blood tests and heart checks showed no problems, and doctors discharged her the following day with pills called ACE inhibitors to lower her blood pressure.

They failed to take effect and, over 18 months, she had eight similar ambulance admissions - with her blood pressure alarmingly high. Doctors tried a number of different medications, including beta-blockers, but nothing seemed to work, and the side-effects left her feeling unwell.

But a chance discovery 18 months after her first episode revealed the true cause. A doctor sent her for further tests on her heart, including an angiogram, which involves sending a tube into the vessels around her heart via an artery in her groin. This releases a special dye, enabling the vessels to be seen under X-ray.

However, during the procedure the doctors were worried that one of the blood vessels in her groin had started to swell, and gave Susan a CT scan.

Although this showed the vessel was fine, it highlighted a small 17mm growth on her left adrenal gland, and Susan was diagnosed with Conn's syndrome.

According to Professor Brown, these growths, called adenomas, can begin in the 20s and 30s, but are so slow growing that they create a problem only in middle-age. Furthermore, the body can compensate for the high aldosterone levels for a number of years, but eventually is unable to do this.

Some patients start to develop symptoms before middle-age. 'For reasons that are not clear, young patients are more likely to be women, and to have larger adenomas, whereas older patients tend to be men with smaller growths,' says Professor Brown.

'We think the tumours started at a similar age, but the smaller tumours take much longer to be diagnosed.'

Although doctors are still unsure what causes the condition, one possibility is a genetic link, as certain inherited mutations can cause high levels of aldosterone.

There is also evidence that high salt in the diet may also trigger the condition, as it damages cells in the adrenal glands.

Until recently, Conn's syndrome was thought to affect only a handful of treatment-resistant high blood pressure patients. But recent research, as well as the development of more sophisticated scans, has revealed that many patients have the microscopic growths - adenomas - in their adrenal glands, which trigger excessive levels of aldosterone.

High blood pressure, known as the silent killer, is often symptomless but is a leading cause of stroke, killing 40,000 Britons every year

Professor Brown says although one in ten treatment-resistant cases has obvious growths on their adrenal glands, a further 10 to 15 per cent may have microscopic growths which are visible only with a special scan called a PET-CT. This uses a mildly radioactive dye to locate nodules, and CT scans to pinpoint location.

However, these scans are expensive, and still may not show very small growths. Instead, to confirm diagnosis, he recommends a £15 blood test to check levels of the kidney hormone renin, which is almost always suppressed in Conn's syndrome and is a good indicator of it.

'If renin is low, then a further blood test costing about £25 can check aldosterone levels, and then a scan can look for tumours,' he says.

We can survive with only one adrenal gland, so if one is affected, it can be removed with surgery. However, if both glands are affected, surgery is not an option. Professor Brown adds that, for some reason, only 50 per cent of older patients respond to surgery.

Instead, doctors prescribe drugs that block aldosterone production, with common ones including spironolactone (which may trigger the growth of breast tissue in men) or the more expensive eplerenone.

'Once resistant hypertension has developed, the chances of this being due to high aldosterone are so high that renin should be measured, if only to make sure the patient receives the correct drugs, as these are not usually used in hypertension,' says Professor Brown.

One patient who understands the importance of an accurate diagnosis is Charles Payne. The 63-year-old business adviser from Bishop's Stortford, Herts, had been taking high doses of six different blood pressure drugs daily for nearly ten years - yet even on this regimen, his blood pressure remained exceptionally high, hovering around 180/120.

'My GP eventually offered a referral to a cardiologist,' he says.

'By luck, the one with the first appointment was at Addenbrooke's, where I was invited to join a British Heart Foundation-funded trial for patients with resistant hypertension, under Professor Brown, who early on told me he suspected my hypertension was hormonal.'

With no tumours, Charles did not qualify for surgery, but tests showed his levels of aldosterone were high, suggesting microscopic growths in his adrenal glands. A combination of the drugs eplerenone and amiloride, which maintains potassium levels, now keeps his blood pressure at a steady 135/90.

Professor Brown explains: 'Not only is high blood pressure a major health risk, but the low levels of potassium can be very fatiguing.

'As soon as we redress this balance - with surgery or aldosterone-blocking drugs - potassium levels return to normal, and patients often feel more energetic.'

Susan Thornton has not suffered from high blood pressure since having surgery to remove the growth in her gland. 'I haven't taken any other blood pressure drug since the operation and I am so relieved to be free of their side-effects,' she says.

'I felt I'd returned from a very long journey and found myself again.'
