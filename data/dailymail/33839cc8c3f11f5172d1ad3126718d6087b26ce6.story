A nine-year-old girl has been left traumatised after her classmates ripped up Christmas cards she gave to them because they didn't come with candy canes.

Annie Winter, from Coomera on the Gold Coast, bought cards for her daughter Lori to give out to children at school but couldn't find mini candy canes at the shop.

Ms Winter said the Year 3 student has been left extremely upset after the cards were thrown out right in front of her.

'She said "Mum some of the people today just threw them out", they ripped them up in front of her,' she told Daily Mail Australia.

'It's just so rude, she's a fairly private person anyway and it's like a slap in the face.

'She's doesn't like showing her feelings so outright, that's why when she came home and told me about it she said "Mum I'm not doing that again", she doesn't want to put herself out there.'

Ms Winter said she didn't think the children did it to intentionally bully her daughter.

'I think it's more to do with the expectation kids seem to have these days, they've kind of got this attitude of what to get out of things rather than what they can give,' she said.

'You can't say that for all kids but I just question whether or not it's a sign of the times or is the way we're parenting?

Ms Winter said she didn't think the children did it to intentionally bully her daughter, but instead thought they lacked manners and expected too much

'Are we not showing kids to be grateful?'

Ms Winter said she is treating the whole ordeal as a learning experience for Lori and her younger daughter Holly, seven.

'My biggest thing, I want them to be kind and I want them to be responsible for their actions,' she said.

'I want them to have the old fashion manners and respect and I think it starts in the home.'

Since Ms Winter posted about her daughter on a community Facebook page the family has been inundated with messages of support and people wanting to send Christmas cards to Lori.

'It just brought me to tears, I've gone through and read all of the messages to my daughters,' she said.

'I think that's really encouraged Lori, I want to show her this is what people are really like.'
