Legend has it that at the end of every rainbow sits a leprechaun, hammering on a shoe, who will reveal the whereabouts of a crock of gold.

But if the prospect of that one pot  isn't quite enough, sometimes Mother Nature offers the chance to pursue two - or even four - as it did in West Sussex today.

Residents in Worthing were treated to a stunning sight early this morning as an all-but-complete double rainbow fanned across the sky, providing a perfect frame for the seaside town.

Despite heavy rain and dark shadows looming across the sky, the grey ribbons of clouds momentarily parted to allow the semi-circle rainbow to spread across the horizon, revealing both ends of the colourful phenomenon.

This was the stunning sight which spread across the sky in Worthing, West Sussex, today, when both ends of a spectacular double rainbow were revealed 

Is it usually expected that someone must be at the height of a mountaintop to see a half-circle rainbow, due to the angle and height that the sun is required to be at. Sometimes, the full circle can be seen, perhaps during an activity such as sky-dicing.

Due to the mixture of rain and sunshine in the past few days, there have been an array of incredible rainbows pictured around the UK.

There was a spectacular sight over Fistral Beach in Newquay yesterday, as a double rainbow appeared to rise out of the sea and arch over the seaside town.

And an almost-complete rainbow appeared over  Aberystwyth, west Wales, yesterday, as wet and windy descended on the area. 

Rainbows are caused when sunlight refracts as it enters a raindrop, splitting it into different wavelengths which are seen by the eye as an arc-shaped spectrum of different colors. 

Double rainbows occur when the light is reflected as it leaves a raindrop, producing a second, fainter, rainbow nearby, only with the bands of colour reversed. 

The area between the two rainbows is known as 'Alexander's Band', named after Alexander of Aphrodisias who first described its occurrence in 200 AD. 

The rainbow has a place in the mythologies of many cultures. In Greco-Roman mythology it was considered to be a path made by a messenger between Earth and Heaven.

For the Chinese, the rainbow was a slit in the sky sealed by the goddess Nüwa using stones of five different colours.

For Australian aborigines the rainbow serpent is the creator and of course for Christians, the rainbow is a pledge from God not to destroy the world with floods.

The rainbows came as Britain braces itself for wet and cold weather over the new few days, with forecasters predicting clear skies but freezing temperatures through to Bonfire Night. 

Just five days after basking in the warmest Halloween on record, Britain is braced for temperatures to dip below freezing on Bonfire Night.

The mercury hit 23.6C (74.5F) in London and Kent on October 31, but could fall as low as -7C (19.4F) in northern Scotland tomorrow.

But forecasters said tomorrow’s weather is quite normal for November, and it will only seem so cold to Britons because of the balmy autumn. 

Temperatures in urban areas could fall to about 0C (32F) on November 5, but dip below freezing to -3C (26.6F) in rural areas, the Met Office said. 

It's cold... and it's getting colder: Early morning fog and frost today in Temple Newsham Park in Leeds, West Yorkshire

Hottest Halloween on record: Just five days ago, on October 31, this couple were relaxing in the sunshine at London's Green Park - but temperatures are set to drop for Bonfire Night 

The UK low is likely to be close to the -7.8C (18F) seen at the summit of the Cairn Gorm mountain in the Scottish Highlands on Bonfire Night last year.

The previous two years saw Bonfire Night lows of -5.3C (22.5F) at Shap, Cumbria, in 2012, and -2.9C (26.8F) at Cromdale in the Highlands in 2011. 

Last Friday the UK record for the warmest Halloween was smashed, as Kew Gardens in west London and Gravesend in Kent both hit 23.6C (74.5F).

This beat the previous high of 20C (68F) set at Dartford in Kent in 1968. Conditions were warmer than those in Rome, Barcelona and San Francisco.

So far, 2014 is the warmest year on record, following consistently mild temperatures which have continued into autumn, according to MeteoGroup.
