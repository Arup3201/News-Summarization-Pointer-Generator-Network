Amir Khan may have to watch Floyd Mayweather's rematch with Marcos Maidana on the big screen after being denied entry into the US because of visa problems - but the British boxer has asked Prime Minister David Cameron to help fast-track his application.

Khan was looking forward to being part of the crowd at the MGM Grand on Saturday night, but will instead be confined to the box, despite insisting his journey to America had been sorted.

He Tweeted: 'Visa to America was declined after i had it approved a week ago. Was looking forward to the fight. Means I'm still in England.'

However, just five hours later the fighter took to Twitter again to say he had spoken to David Cameron about getting his visa application fast-tracked. 

'Spoke to the PM @David Cameron about fast tracking my appointment to the US embassy. He will get back to me shortly. Thanks for the support,' he tweeted.

Mayweather has promised to put on a boxing masterclass in Las Vegas on Saturday night and said his opponent fully deserves a rematch against the American superstar.

The pair originally fought back in May, when Mayweather controversially won by split-decision to extend his unbeaten professional record to 46 bouts.

'I know I'm almost 40 but I'm still going strong,' said Mayweather. 'I still feel good and I want to go out there and perform. I'm going to give you guys what you want to see.

'[Maidana] is always in tip-top shape. Does he deserve a rematch? Absolutely. I commend him and I commend his team for stepping up to the plate and making it happen again.'
