The Queen is preparing for a historic visit to the Vatican to meet Pope Francis, the Mail can reveal.

Her meeting with the new Pope during her first overseas trip for three years will delight Britain’s four million Roman Catholics.

It will also strengthen ties between the Anglican and Catholic churches, both of which appointed new leaders last year.

The new Archbishop of Canterbury, Justin Welby, has already met Pope Francis at the Vatican.

In an extraordinary break with tradition, say Vatican sources, the Pope will not receive the Queen at the Papal state apartments inside the Apostolic Palace.

Rather, the Argentina-born Pontiff, who has a habit of dispensing with protocol, wants to keep the visit intimate and informal.

He is expected to welcome her to the simple Vatican boarding house which he has made his home and offer her a cup of tea in a small sitting room.

The Pope has three rooms inside the Domus Sanctae Marthae, or St Martha’s House, a five-storey hostel run by nuns where he is often seen in the canteen when not cooking his own pasta.

The royal visit is expected in April, shortly before the Queen’s 88th birthday, and she will be accompanied by Prince Philip, 92.

Contrary to reports that Buckingham 
Palace plans to curtail their foreign travel, they will go overseas to 
meet three world leaders in as many months.

Yesterday
 the Palace announced the Queen will make a three-day state visit to 
France in June for the D-Day landings 70th anniversary.

Meeting: In 1982, the Queen became the first sovereign to welcome a Pope when John Paul II came to London

With Prince Philip, she will undertake engagements in Normandy to mark the British war effort of June 6, 1944. Then, the couple wlll go to Paris to be formally received by President Francois Hollande and attend a series of state events.

In Rome, the Queen will also meet Italian President Giorgio Napolitano, a great admirer. The meeting with the Pope will be in striking contrast to the pageantry of 1980 when she became the first British monarch to make a state visit to the Vatican.

There was also strict formality in 2000 when the Queen went to the Vatican on a state visit to Italy.

This time, the atmosphere will certainly be very different from the security clampdown and media  circus expected a few weeks earlier when Pope Francis entertains  US President Barack Obama.

The Queen’s visit will underline her 
position as the most Catholic-friendly Supreme Governor of the Church of
 England of modern times.

In 1982, she became the first sovereign to welcome a Pope when John Paul II came to London. She also gave Pope Benedict XVI a full state welcome when he arrived in Edinburgh in 2010.

Only nine months ago, she signed 
legislation repealing the 300-year rule excluding royals who married 
Catholics from the succession.

Three weeks ago, Pope Francis included Britain’s most senior Catholic, the Archbishop of Westminster, Vincent Nichols, in his first batch of new cardinals.

The visit puts paid to suggestions the Queen is about to hand over most duties to other royals.

This will be a long ‘awayday’ to Rome, with no overnight stay, but involves two high-level visits and makes it clear that the Queen and her husband intend to remain active in international public life.

It was President Napolitano, rather than Pope Francis, who originally suggested the Vatican visit.

Though a member of the Italian communist party for 46 years, he is a great admirer of the Queen and, being nine months her senior, just pips her to the title of Europe’s oldest head of state.

The two leaders are said to get on extremely well and Mr and Mrs Napolitano have visited the Queen and Prince Philip at Buckingham Palace several times.

Palace officials declined to comment on whether they expect Mr Hollande, 59, to have a new First Lady at his side.

Last month, the French leader split from girlfriend Valerie Trierweiler, 48, after his affair with actress Julie Gayet, 41, was revealed. He has refused to answer questions on the delicate subject.
