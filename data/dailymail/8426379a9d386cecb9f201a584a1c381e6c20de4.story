The Asiana Airlines flight that crashed in San Francisco in July killing three people was going dangerously slowly, a new document reveals.

Asiana Airlines said in a report to the National Transportation Safety Board (NTSB) that the flight crew failed to maintain a minimum air speed during its final approach.Â 

The South Korean airline also blamed what it called 'inadequate warning systems' for alerting the crew that the auto-throttle had stopped maintaining the set air speed.

The Asiana Airlines flight that crashed at San Francisco International Airport, was probably caused by the pilots flying dangerously slowly

Asiana Airlines has blamed the design of the auto-throttle for the crash, an issue that had been raised previously

It suggested the aircraft manufacturer, Boeing Co, modify the low speed alert system on its planes.

Immediately after the July 6, 2013 crash at San Francisco International Airport, Asiana Airlines said there appeared to be no mechanical problem with the aircraft.

But in its latest document the airline blamed the design of the auto-throttle, an issue that had been raised previously.

However, in its submission to the NTSB, Boeing said 'there were numerous cues' that the aircraft's speed was slowing dangerously and it placed the blame for the crash squarely on the pilots.

Three people were killed in the crash, with one of the victims, a 16-year-old girl, apparently surviving being ejected onto the tarmac, only to be run over by a fire truck

The aircraft manufacturer said: 'This accident occurred due to the flight crew's failure to monitor and control air speed, thrust level and glide path on short final approach.

'This accident would have been avoided had the flight crew followed procedures and initiated a timely go-around as the approach became increasingly unstable.'

The crash killed three people and injured more than 180 and was the first fatal commercial plane crash in the United States since February 2009.

One of the victims, a 16-year-old girl, apparently survived being ejected onto the tarmac, only to be run over by a fire truck.

But aircraft manufacturer Boeing said 'there were numerous cues' that the aircraft's speed was slowing dangerously

The co-pilot, who was training the pilot flying the plane, thought the auto-throttle on the Boeing 777 jet might not have been operating, the documents showed.

The pilot flying the plane said he wasn't sure whether the auto-throttle was maintaining speed, according to the documents.

The low, slow landing caused the plane's tail to hit a seawall short of the runway.

The plane spun 330 degrees as it broke apart and caught fire, strewing wreckage along the runway.

The NTSB opened an investigative hearing into the causes of the crash in December and has been examining concerns about the auto-throttle.
