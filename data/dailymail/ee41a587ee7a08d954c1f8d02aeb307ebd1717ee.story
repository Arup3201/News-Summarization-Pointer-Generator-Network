Los Angeles police expected to receive hundreds if not thousands of handguns, rifles and shotguns when they held their gun buyback on Wednesday.

But even hardened officers were surprised two rocket launchers were handed in by the city's residents.

The hefty weapons were among nearly 2,000 guns given up to police in exchange for $100 and $200 grocery store gift cards.

According to Gawker, the LAPD received 901 handguns, 698 rifles and 363 shotguns in the program, as well as the two rocket launchers.

However, Gawker quoted a police source as saying that the guns were not that unusual, and that 'we've had them in the past.'

According to police, such weapons are generally antiques picked up by collectors or passed down by family members.

The Los Angeles buyback program was aimed
 at getting weapons off the streets in the wake of the devastating 
shooting at Sandy Hook Elementary school in Newtown, Connecticut, on 
December 14.

Lines of cars and people stretched around the block in the first hours of the exchange on Wednesday morning to take advantage of the guns-for-groceries deal.

Police officers filled bins with a variety of rifles and handguns outside the Los Angeles Memorial Sports Arena and the Van Nuys Masonic Temple.

Police reported netting nearly 500 
fire arms and 31 assault weapons between both LA locations in the first 
few hours of the buyback.

'No
 ID checks, we're not taking down license plates, people drive up, they 
have a gun in their trunk, we have one of our gun experts take that gun 
out, make sure it's safe, they walk over, get a gift card, and away they
 go,' Police Cmdr Andrew Smith told CBS Los Angeles on Wednesday.Â 

Success: Hand guns, pictured, were left by their owners in a trash bin at the LA gun buyback on Wednesday

Assault weapons: Police collected a range of weapons including assault rifles, hand guns and shot guns

'It's very quick and painless.'

Handguns, rifles and shotguns were swapped for $100 Ralphs grocery store gift cards while assault weapons earned a $200 card.

Officials were mindful of both the 
Newtown massacre, in which Adam Lanza, 20, shot dead his mother then 
stormed an elementary school, killing 20 students and six staff in a 
barrage of bullets.

They were also thinking of a gunman's ambush that killed two firefighters in Webster, N.Y. on Christmas Eve.

'All of us are still mourning the 
tragedy at Newtown, Connecticut,' said Mayor Antonio Villaraigosa.

Well received: A police officer walks away with three rifles received by the program that had already pulled in hundreds of firearms in the first hours

Tragic inspiration: Police officers load bins containing guns onto a truck during the gun buyback whose date was moved up after the mass shooting at Sandy Hook Elementary School earlier this month

Positive effect: Since the program's creation in 2009, there has been a 39 per cent drop in gang crimes and 22 per cent drop in calls reporting shots being fired

'So 
many young innocent children were mass-murdered in the way that they 
were, and now the assassination of two firefighters ... just breaks the 
heart of so many of us, particularly in this holiday season.'

The program was originally scheduled for May but in the wake of the December 14th shooting rampage at Sandy Hook Elementary, Mr Villaraigosa decided to do it now.

The last buyback program netted about 1,700 guns.

Since the program's creation in 2009, there has been a 39 per cent drop in gang crimes and 22 per cent drop in calls reporting shots being fired according to police.

Los Angeles resident Commorah Fisher said she participated in the program to ensure her weapons didn't get into the wrong hands.

Process: When drivers pulled up the unloaded weapons would be removed from their trunks by gun inspectors before they were taken away and a gift card presented in exchange

Worth: A police officer inspects one of the guns where automatic weapons would receive a $200 grocery store gift card and shotguns, handguns and rifles $100 gift cards

'To
 turn in some ammunition, and guns that may be stolen from our house and
 you know someone may do something really bad with them,' she told CBS of her reasoning. 'That's why 
I'm turning them in.'

In 2004, a report by the National Academy of Sciences, however, argued that such exchanges were ineffective in the fight against gun violence.

'The theory underlying gun buyback programs is badly flawed and the empirical evidence demonstrates the ineffectiveness of these programs,' the report reads.

Authors argued that the majority of guns received are those least likely to be used in criminal activities. They were generally guns that were old, malfunctioning, or those owned by people who don't see the value in owning a weapon.
