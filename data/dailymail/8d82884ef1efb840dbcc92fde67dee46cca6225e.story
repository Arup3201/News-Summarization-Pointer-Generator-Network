It would be the perfect festive treat for those looking to keep the weight off –  low-fat chocolate.

And scientists claim to have found a way to make it happen. 

The have come up with ‘choco-lite, which contains microscopic bubbles of a jelly made from seaweed that bulk out the chocolate. 

Scientists at Warwick University claim they have found a way to make tasty low-fat chocolate using agar bubbles

The agar bubbles are also high in fibre, a natural appetite suppressant.

Previous attempts to reduce the fat content of chocolate – usually about 30 per cent – while retaining the taste and texture have failed.

For instance, tiny air bubbles leave 
chocolate feeling too light, while water bubbles take away the crispness
 of the snapping sound and risk a white bloom forming on the bar.

So Dr Stefan Bon, of Warwick University, turned to agar, which is already used in the cosmetics industry. 

Heated in the right way, it solidifies at the same temperature as chocolate. The bubbles are so small that the mouth cannot distinguish them from fat. 

Jianshe Chen, of Leeds University, told New Scientist magazine: ‘Fat replacer is something the food industry is very keen to have.’

The microscopic agar bubbles are high in fibre and therefore more filling than the fat in normal chocolate

Agar is 80 per cent fibre, meaning it’s a lot more filling than normal chocolate. 

As for how it tastes, according to this week’s New Scientist, that is ‘pretty darned good’.

Dr Bon, who usually works on new recipes for paints and industrial coatings, has tried adding vodka to the mix.

This ‘didn’t taste particularly nice’  but he is looking forward to trying out Baileys and amaretto flavourings.

Industry experts welcomed the advance but questioned whether the public will embrace healthy chocolate.

But Angus Kennedy, of trade magazine Kennedy’s Confection, said: ‘This is very clever and it’s dinner party chat but people don’ t eat chocolate to be healthy.’
