'Forced out': Former police call handler Lisa Hewitt said she was given a warning over her red dye job

A former police call handler has quit after a decade's service claiming she was 'picked on' for her auburn hair colour.

Lisa Hewitt, 42, refused to change her 'distinctive style' despite being given a formal warning by Warwickshire Police last year - 16 months after having the dye job.

She resigned from the force and worked her last day three weeks ago, saying she was fed up of the threat of disciplinary action.

Mrs Hewitt, who lives with her husband Martin, 44, and two children in the village of Kineton, Warwickshire, dealt with 101 and internal calls at the force headquarters.

She was happy in her job, she insisted, until she began being 'bullied' before receiving a warning on October 8.

According to the mother-of-two, it ordered her to change her hair colour or face 'potential dismissal'.

'I believe I was singled out,' she said. 'For what reason I really don't know, [but] I felt I was picked on and bullied while others with bright hair and nails were not.

'I think they were trying to save on a redundancy payment. I've heard there are redundancies coming.

'I was not being awkward, but when they asked me to change my hair colour, I refused. My distinctive style is part of my personality.'

Mrs Hewitt also took more than two months off sick last summer, which she said was caused by stress brought on by a lack of staff.

She said workers who left were not replaced and she sometimes had to run Warwickshire's 101 non-emergency hotline on her own.

'Many a time I was on my own on an eight-hour weekend shift,' she said. 'On some weekdays I was left to run all of Warwickshire 101 calls on my own for four to five hours.

'People were complaining that they could not get through on 101 and were calling 999.

'I asked for help but was told I had to cope. They were putting so much work on me and I just could not cope.'

Warwickshire Police and its partner West Mercia Police have almost finished a three-year plan to cut spending by £30million.

'Our appearance is essential, as perceptions are quickly formed based on first impressions. We will present a positive and professional image at all times.

'All staff must keep their hair clean, neat and tidy. Hairstyle, colour and cut should look discreet and natural. Individuals with long hair have a duty to ensure that the length does not put them or others at risk.

'Make-up should be discreet and in keeping with the organisation’s professional business-like image. Strong colours and contrast should be avoided.

'Nails must be kept to an appropriate length so as to comply with Heath and Safety, and to maintain a business like appearance. The length should not hinder expected work activities. Officers and staff who come into contact with the public will only wear natural or clear coloured nail varnish. Strong colours and contrast should be avoided.

'Failure to comply with this policy may instigate management activities linked with misconduct, and poor or unsatisfactory performance.'

New consultation is now under way on another £30million of cuts between 2015 and 2018.

Mrs Hewitt added: 'I had never had complaints about my work. I was always well-dressed. I did a good job and my hair colour should not affect it.

'I did not like going in but I did to serve my notice and act professionally. I loved that job. They have lost ten years of knowledge and experience.' 

It is not yet known whether Mrs Hewitt is intending to pursue her claims to an employment tribunal.

The force's head of services Tania Coppola said: 'We treat the employment of our workforce very seriously and have an organisational change policy to ensure we treat everyone fairly.

'The welfare of our staff is of utmost importance and a priority.

'Warwickshire Police and West Mercia Police have high standards for their workforce and we have a number of policies, including a dress and appearance policy, which includes clear rules and guidance on dress code.

'We follow our policies and challenge officers and staff where appropriate..

'It is not appropriate for us to comment on individual employees, regardless of whether they are a current or previous employee.'

The force did not directly address Mrs Hewitt's claims that she had to work alone, but Superintendent David Gardner said in a statement: 'Warwickshire Police and West Mercia Police operate three control rooms across the alliance area, with over 300 employees working in a range of roles including switchboard operators and call handlers.

'In our control rooms, it is a priority to answer and deal with calls as quickly and effectively as possible, to enable us to protect people from harm.'
