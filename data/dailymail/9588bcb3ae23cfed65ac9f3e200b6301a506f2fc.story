Most of the world may be struggling through another year of hard times, but, it seems, no one has told Harrods.

The department store is making sure the country’s billionaires – the City bankers, hedge fund bosses, Russian magnates and Arab potentates – can look forward to a truly luxurious Christmas with this hamper, which at £20,000 costs as much as many young couples can afford to put down as a deposit on their first home.

Aptly named The Decadence, this gift for the oligarch who has everything brings together some of the most expensive food and drink in the world. 

Harrods' hamper, aptly named The Decadence, costs £20,000 and includes caviar and fine wines

Harrods insists that it is worth the eye-watering price – but if you are considering getting one for  Christmas morning, be aware of one glaring omission. The huge hamper does not come with a turkey.

And you would need to shell out for a fairly gargantuan bird to grace a table kitted out with the contents of this gift basket.

There are 25 bottles of wine and spirits, including magnums of Dom Perignon, Cristal and Taittinger champagne.

The wine selection includes a 2007 Chateau Margaux red and a magnum of sweet Chateau D’Yquem 2002, both world famous.

For an after dinner tipple, try the Balvenie single malt whisky, which has been aged for 30 years, or the Courvoisier Initiale Extra cognac.

There is a 2kg pack of exclusive Kopi Luwak coffee, which, bizarrely, is  collected from the dung of Asian palm civet cats after they have been fed a diet of coffee berries.

Apparently, the cats’ digestive process improves the flavour, delivering what Harrods calls the ‘world’s finest and most expensive coffee beans’. The centrepiece of the feast is the 8kg Iberico ham, which comes with its own special carving knife.

The meat, considered one of Spain’s food treasures, comes from purebred black Iberian pigs that spend their lives roaming free, foraging for a natural diet of acorns.

The selection of meats also includes Capocollo di Martina Franca, an Italian salami from the hills of Apulia that is cured for up to 180 days, Iberian chorizo, Mortandella Corra from Italy, and Salame Strolghino.

Established in 1824, Harrods has grown to become the most prestigious department store in Europe

There are not one, but two types of caviar, including a 125g pot of Oscietra from the prized Ossetra sturgeon, a fish that weighs up to 400 pounds and can live for 50 years.

This is outdone by the even more exclusive Beluga caviar, harvested from fish in the Caspian Sea.From closer to home is a 500g royal fillet of Scottish salmon, described as ideal for a Boxing Day buffet.

The hamper courts controversy with its two types of pate de foie gras with truffles, one made of duck liver and the other from goose.

Animal welfare campaigners are pushing for a ban on the delicacy because it is usually produced by force-feeding birds until their livers swell to an unnatural size, taking on the soft texture that is prized by gourmets.

A decent cheese board is a Christmas must and the Harrods range does not disappoint.

There is a 1.15kg half baby Stilton, together with a Torta de Trujillo, made from the milk of sheep that graze freely on herbs and grasses.

There is also a selection of other cheeses, including an 825g round  of aged West Country farmhouse cheddar, matured for nine months.

While the traditional turkey and veg have been neglected – there’s not a sprout in sight – recipients do get an ‘extra-special three-tiered Christmas cake, decorated with resplendent ribbons’, which weighs in at 9.5kg.

And of course, there is an Archive Collection Christmas Pudding, inspired by recipes from Harrods’ original 1930s range. In case pantry staples such as olive oil and orange marmalade seem a little too pedestrian after all that luxury, Harrods offers them to the discerning customer liberally sprinkled with flakes of real gold. The oil alone would set you back £750.

There’s even a selection of fresh fruit – to help kickstart a post-Christmas diet, perhaps.

A small 68g bottle of Leonardi balsamic vinegar, which is aged for 100 years and normally costs £235, is so exclusive that each one is numbered and presented in a gift box.

The luxury presentation is finished off with mini mince pies, a box of six Christmas crackers, table decorations and a Harrods slate cheese board with a glass cloche.

The £20,000 hamper is delivered in a wooden presentation trunk, rather than a wicker basket.Harrods, established by Charles Henry Harrod in 1824, grew to become the largest and most prestigious department store in Europe.

Today it has more than one million square feet of selling space in London’s Knightsbridge.

Its motto Omnia Omnibus Ubique, or ‘all things for all people, everywhere’, is somewhat at odds with its modern devotion to providing luxury goods to the super rich. In May 2010, long-term owner Mohamed Al-Fayed sold the store to Qatar Holdings, the sovereign wealth fund of Qatar, for £1.5billion.

The deal was considered so momentous that it was finalised by the Qatari Prime Minister, Hamad bin Jassim bin Jaber Al Thani.

Bruce Langlands, director of food at Harrods, said it has a deserved reputation for the world’s finest hampers.

‘The Decadence is a showcase of the most enticing and delectable flavours available from across the globe and carefully sourced by our team of experts and suppliers,’ he added.

‘This hamper caters to those with genuine discernment for quality; from extra virgin olive oil with 24-carat gold flakes and Beluga caviar to  a selection of finest wines and champagnes.’

He stressed that cheaper options are available – for those not thinking of taking out a new mortgage for a few seasonal treats.

Alternatives include a Celebration of Chocolate at £125 and The Archive Hamper at £225.
