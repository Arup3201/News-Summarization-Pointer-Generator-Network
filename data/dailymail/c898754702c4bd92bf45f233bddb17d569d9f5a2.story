A female pilot has been appointed as the first woman bomber commander in RAF history. 

The unnamed war veteran - who will be named later this week - will be given command of at least 250 highly-trained staffers in her role as wing commander of a frontline squadron of bombers.

She will head a squadron of around 16 Tornado GR4 jets, whose home base is at RAF Marham, Norfolk, as well as two other Tornado squadrons.

Under her command will be 30 of Britain's top gun pilots and flying weapons system operators. 

It means the pilot is likely to play a key role in fighting missions against groups such as the Islamic State or al-Qaeda.

Tornado warplanes have taken part in air raids against ISIS and were used repeatedly during the British mission in Afghanistan.

A military insider told The Daily Mirror: 'This person – who will be named later this week – is an extremely accomplished member of the RAF's aviator elite.

'She will bring with her an absolute wealth of experience of the front line and will carry a huge weight of responsibility which she has demonstrated she is best qualified to do.;

They added that the woman will be the most senior aviator able to fly on missions against 'whatever threat comes along'.

The pilot's speciality is flying in a two-seater £9.4million Tornado jet, which costs £35,000 an hour to fly on missions.

The military source added that the pilot would be trained in 'escape and evasion' techniques to prepare her for being shot down in conflict zones.
