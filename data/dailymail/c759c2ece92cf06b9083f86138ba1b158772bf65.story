Many favourite first names from just a century ago are at risk of dying out or are already extinct, new research reveals.

Extinct names - those that were among the most popular in 1905, but are no longer chosen - include Gertrude, Bertha and Blodwen for girls plus Willie, Cecil and Rowland for boys.

Names classified as 'endangered' include Horace, Leslie and Norman for boys and Doris, Hilda and Edna for girls.

Researchers analysed millions of birth records from 1905 to the present day. Names classified as 'extinct' were those that were in the top 100 in 1905 but not present in the 2012 lists.

'Endangered' names were those that had fallen in prevalence by 99 per cent, while 'at risk' names were those that had fallen by 98 per cent.

The study, by family history website Ancestry.co.uk, showed names in the 'at risk' category - those still being chosen, but significantly less common than they used to be - include Cyril, Arnold and Bernard for boys, plus Mildred, Dorothy and Lilian for girls.

Many popular names from the early 20th Century have also evolved to their shorter form, which has replaced their previous name in popularity.

Termed the ‘Alfie effect’, this trend has seen Freddie replace Frederick, Archie overtake Archibald and Charlie become far more popular now than Charles.

The same applies to girls’ names, with Lexi replacing Alexandra, Sophia making way for Sophie and Ellie overtaking Eleanor.

Names in the 'at risk' category - those still being chosen, but significantly less common than they used to be - include Arnold, like that of Arnold Schwarzenegger, right, and Trevor, famed by inventor Trevor Bayliss, left

The analysis also showed far more girls’ names disappearing or ‘at risk’ than boys - thought to be because many mens' names are passed on from father to son, whereas mothers’ names are more likely to be selected as middle names, rather than forenames, for daughters.

However, many of the most popular 
names of 1905 remain common today, driven by the fact that one in three 
parents (34 per cent) choose their child’s name to commemorate an 
ancestor.

Such names include Lily, Hannah and Lydia for girls and Alan, Patrick and Joe for boys.

And
 a number of names have surged in popularity or become fashionable 
recently, overtaking the level of popularity seen in the early 1900s.

Oliver, Charlie and Jacob fall into this category, as do Amelia, Grace and Isabella.

Miriam Silverman, Ancestry’s UK content manager, said: 'Of course, no first name can truly become extinct, as it can easily be resurrected, but it’s fascinating to look at the list from 1905 and see which have thrived and which have faded into obscurity.

'We also know that people appreciate a rare or unusual name in their family tree and as more people join the family history revolution we believe that such endangered names will be protected by concerned descendants.'

Harry is a traditional name which has boomed over recent years and topped many 'top 10 boys' names' lists, perhaps thanks to Prince Harry, pictured
