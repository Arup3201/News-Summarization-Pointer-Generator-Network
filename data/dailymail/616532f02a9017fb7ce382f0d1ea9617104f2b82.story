The doctor in charge of the endoscopy that led to Joan Rivers' death once operated on an elderly patient without his informed consent.

The 93-year-old patient lost his 2004 medical malpractice suit against Dr. Lawrence Cohen, his attorneys admitted.

However, his attorneys also claim there were similarities between that procedure and Rivers' operation.

The 93-year-old patient lost his 2004 medical malpractice suit against Dr. Lawrence Cohen, his attorneys admitted

Rivers died Sept. 4 at Mount Sinai 
Hospital, a week after going into cardiac arrest. The sharp-tongued 
comedian, talk show host and fashionista was 81.

The New York Post reports that Yorkville Endoscopy spokeswoman Marcia Horowitz denies similarities between those two procedures.

She added that the 2004 patient, Dr. David Lehr, went into surgery as 'an emergency, not an elective, as Ms. Rivers' was.'

Lehr's attorneys, Denise Rubin and Cheryl Harris, shot back that the 'characterization of Dr. Lehr's procedure as being being an emergency is at odds with the hospital record and testimony.'

Lehr's attorney claims he was put under before he was able to tell doctors he'd had two meals earlier that day.

That caused him to vomit, and later develop severe pneumonia.

Cohen is no longer the Yorkville Endoscopy facility's medical director, nor is he performing procedures there

'As a
 result the previously vital and active 93-year-old retired physician 
who was still involved in scholarly writing was rendered a homebound 
invalid for the rest of his life,' doctors said.

However as a clinic spokesman noted: 'the jury found that appropriate 
standards of care were met and that informed consent was given. Multiple
 experts testified and the jury found these claims to have no merit.'

Cohen is no longer the facility's medical 
director, nor is he performing procedures there.

The spokeswoman did not elaborate on the circumstances surrounding Cohen's departure.

The state health department has said 
it's investigating "the whole matter." A spokesman for the department 
did not immediately have an update on the investigation Friday.

The city medical examiner's office is 
also investigating.
