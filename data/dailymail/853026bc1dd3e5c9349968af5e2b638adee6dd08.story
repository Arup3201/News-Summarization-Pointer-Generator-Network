When Richie McCaw leads the All Blacks out for the 100th time on Saturday it will cement his status as one of the greatest sporting captains to have lived.

McCaw, who led New Zealand to the 2011 World Cup, has been captain of his country since 2006, and led the All Blacks out on several occasions before being given the full-time job aged 25.

Now 33 and in the twilight of his career, questions of McCaw's legacy are becoming increasingly poignant, especially ahead of Saturday's landmark clash against Wales in Cardiff.

One such question is: where does he rank among the greatest international sporting captains of all time? Well, Sportsmail has come up with a top 10, which unsurprisingly includes the All Black great.

You're sure to disagree with some of the names on the list and certainly the order, so feel free to leave a comment below...

10) Allan Border (Australia, cricket)

Steve Waugh and Ricky Ponting led Australia through a period of utter domination of world cricket through the 1990s and 2000s but none of that would have been possible without Border. Inheriting a side in utter disarray in the mid-1980s, by the time Border had retired in 1994 Australia were playing the brand of dogged, determined cricket that has brought them so much success since. The Baggy Green are made in his image.

9) Willie John McBride (British and Irish Lions, rugby union)

To describe the Ulsterman as a Lions legend would not do his impact on the 15-man game in the British Isles justice. The big second row toured with the Lions five times between 1962 and 1974 and still holds the record for number of appearances in the famous red jersey at 17. McBride captained the Lions on their most successful tour to date - a 3-0 whitewash of South Africa in 1974.

8) Douglas Jardine (England, cricket)

Scourge of the Aussies, Jardine was the mastermind behind the infamous 'Bodyline' tactic which saw England nullify the threat of the peerless Don Bradman and regain the Ashes Down Under in 1932-33. A fierce competitor, the ultra-competitive Jardine reportedly ordered his players to 'hate the Australians' and to refer to Bradman as 'the little bastard'. He lost just one of 15 Tests as captain.

7) Bobby Moore (England, football)

On to the first of our footballers and England's 1966 World Cup-winning captain Moore. A calm, assured presence at the back, Moore became England's youngest ever captain when first handed the armband in 1963 aged just 22. A year later, he was handed the full-time role and would retain it until the last of his 108 caps in 1973. Ninety of those caps came as captain - an English joint-record held with Billy Wright.

6) Franz Beckenbauer (West Germany, football)

Beckenbauer just pips his great rival Moore by virtue of the fact he led his country to two major trophies, rather than one. Like Moore, Beckenbauer was a stylish defender, perhaps even more comfortable with the ball than without it. On the losing side as Moore lifted the Jules Rimet trophy in 1966, 'Der Kaiser' would have his time. Made captain in 1971, he led his country to the European Championship in 1972 and, his crowning glory, the World Cup in 1974.

5) Richie McCaw (New Zealand, rugby union)

Sorry Richie, but we can't get you any higher than No 5. One hundred Tests as captain and a World Cup triumph speak for themselves, but that choke against France in the 2007 quarter-final when the All Blacks looked destined for glory is the one blot in his copybook as captain. McCaw will have the chance of redemption next year at the World Cup on these shores and should he lift the Webb Ellis trophy again, he may just find himself at No 1.

4) Diego Maradona (Argentina, football)

A controversial choice. Those football aficionados among you may wonder how Maradona is above Beckenbauer and Moore. Sure, Maradona is arguably the greatest footballer of all-time but his leadership qualities are not immediately obvious, especially compared with those two stalwarts - the argument goes. But it is exactly that prodigious ability which carried an otherwise average Argentina team to World Cup glory in 1986. Maradona led by the most supreme of examples that summer.

3) Sir Viv Richards (West Indies, cricket)

Back to cricket, and with it one of the most iconic figures the game has known. Like Jardine, Richards was a prickly figure as skipper, never shirking a confrontation and doing everything in his power to win (and he wasn't bad with the bat either). Under Richards' captaincy, which lasted for 50 Tests from 1984 to 1991, West Indies never lost a series.

2) Iker Casillas (Spain, football)

The name 'Casillas' doesn't scream out at you when asked who the greatest sporting captains of all-time are, especially in the wake of Spain's and his dismal World Cup this year. But just look at his record: Casillas captained Spain to three consecutive major trophies - Euro 2008, the 2010 World Cup and Euro 2012. A feat unrivalled in national football captaincy (although Beckenbauer came within a penalty shootout of doing the same at Euro 1976).

1) Martin Johnson (British and Irish Lions and England, rugby union)

We've seen three types of criteria that make great sporting captains: trophies, such as Casillas; character, such as Jardine; and skill, such as Maradona. All 10 of the sportsmen on these list have elements of each, but none have all in such an abundance as did Johnson. 

Johnson's leadership and motivational qualities were second to none during his playing career and he was unrivalled as the greatest lock on the planet until his retirement. And he has the medals to go with it: a World Cup in 2003 and a British and Irish Lions series win touring South Africa, who were then-world champions. He captained both sides, of course.
