Football - or soccer as it is more commonly known in America - is still a growing sport in the United States.

But ahead of Tuesday's last 16 World Cup clash with Belgium, America's newspapers have been stocking up the fire as they show their support for Jurgen Klinsmann's side.

The New York Post in particular sums up the tone in the States as it implores Klinsmann's side to 'go kick some ass'.

They also posted a video which shows Jurgen Klinsmann's side training during the World Cup, traveling to games and fans singing. A voice over from one of the players declares the fans 'will see a group of guys who are committed and ready to fight until the end for each other.'

While across the country, companies have been getting in the spirit by decking their buildings in the national colours of red, white and blue.

They are not the only ones, though, with Belgium Prime Minister Elio Di Rupo challenging US President Barack Obama to a bet on Twitter. He said: 'Hey @BarackObama, I am betting some 
great Belgian beers that our @BelRedDevils will make it to the quarter 
final! :-) #ComeOnBelgium #BEL'. Obama is yet to respond.
