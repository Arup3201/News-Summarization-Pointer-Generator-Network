There was never any question over what Claire Rumble would call her daughter when she was born last month. It was always going to be Rosie, the name of the specialist nurse who looked after her big brother Louis during his three-and-half year battle with leukaemia.

'Deciding on the name was easy,' explains Claire. 'My husband James and I have never met anyone like Rosie — it was a tiny gesture of thanks for everything she’s done.'

Three months earlier, five-year-old Louis had finally finished his treatment and was declared cancer-free.

But it was the empathy and the many extra hours Rosie Chisnell put in helping the anxious family along their journey that has earned her a nomination for the Daily Mail Health Hero award.

'Other nurses clock in and off, Rosie is a constant. There’s no one else like her,' says Claire, a 34-year-old accountant.

The family, who live in Hemel Hempstead, in Hertfordshire, first met Rosie in September 2009,  after a terrifying five days when Louis became suddenly and desperately ill.

'One day he was fine, playing with his twin sister Grace, then suddenly he stopped eating, was pale, exhausted and crying through the night for no apparent reason,' recalls Claire. 'When angry purple bruises appeared all over his body we rushed him to hospital.''

Just 12 hours after a barrage of tests at Watford General Hospital doctors revealed the shocking diagnosis: the 19-month-old had leukaemia. 'You can’t imagine  what being told your son has cancer feels like,' says Claire. 'The world just stops.'

As the hospital’s paediatric oncology nurse, Rosie, 56, was there at the diagnosis. 'For the next two hours Rosie sat with us explaining everything in great depth, fielding our questions and laying everything out clearly and honestly.

'I remember asking her whether Louis was going to die and she said: "His condition is fully treatable." She couldn’t say no, but she has a natural way of reassuring you. It wasn’t until later that I realised her shift had actually finished at 5pm, six hours earlier. She’d stayed to help us.'

It was just the first of many such gestures that demonstrated Rosie’s extraordinary dedication to her young patients.

'Rosie would often call us at 9pm, hours after she should have left, with Louis’s blood results. We’d say: "What are you doing, go home," but she’d just laugh and say  she had a list of patients she needed to call.'

From day one the Rumble family had her mobile number. 'Children aren’t ill nine to five, Monday to Friday,' explains Rosie. 'I would hate to think something might happen and a family couldn’t get hold of me.'

Claire and James, a 37-year-old aircraft engineer, frequently had to call Rosie late at night when Louis developed croup — a fierce barking cough — because of his weak immune system.

'I’d be beside myself, worrying whether he needed to be rushed into hospital or not. Knowing she was there, a phone call away, was a huge emotional support and stopped me flying into a blind panic.'

Once Louis accidentally pulled out his nasogastric tube — a tube inserted via the nose into the stomach to administer medication. Unfortunately, it was on a weekend when Rosie wasn’t working, but she knew putting it back would be a traumatic experience for a child, so dropped everything and drove the 40 minutes from home to the hospital to do the procedure herself.

'I just couldn’t believe it. You don’t expect a nurse to do things like that, especially on their weekend off,' says Claire. 'We knew we had someone special in our corner.'

In February 2010, Louis developed an infection which meant he had to go to hospital twice a day for antibiotic treatment until it cleared.

For a child so young, it was a horrible experience: 'I’d lift him, asleep, from his cot and he’d start crying pleading: ‘No go, Mummy, no go.’ It was heart breaking.'

The next day Rosie called to say not to take Louis to hospital as she was coming to their house with the equipment to teach Claire how to administer the intravenous antibiotics at home.

'I couldn’t believe anyone could be so kind. She arrived with a great crate of equipment and stayed until almost midnight, showing me exactly how it all worked; the pump, the syringes, everything.

'Louis’s face lights up when he sees her and when he was in hospital if he heard her heels click-clacking down the corridor he would sit up in bed.

'She’d chase him around the ward on hands and knees, despite her dress and heels (she doesn’t ‘do’ trousers) and treat him with such care and affection, explaining everything so he wouldn’t be scared.

'Postman Pat would always be put on the TV when she was taking blood samples and she’d administer a bowl of Cheerios, another favourite, if he wasn’t eating.

'Whatever Rosie said, Louis would do. Grace, as his twin, could have felt left out but Rosie included her in everything, even letting her occasionally stay overnight in hospital with him as a sleepover.

'For a parent, you can’t underestimate the impact of having someone like Rosie around. I’d have spent days stewing over Louis’s health, endlessly worrying, but Rosie being just a phone call away meant I was less anxious and felt more in control. She helped me and James to focus on the practicalities of his treatment and be better parents.'

So what drives this kind of dedication? 'It’s the children,' Rosie explains. 'They’re a model to us all. They just get on with it, the good and the bad. If I can improve their lives, or their families, even a bit, I’m happy.

'I know in this job I can make a difference. I’ve always loved children and got on with them easily and even as a little girl knew I wanted to be a nurse.'

Rosie, who is married to Ian, a solicitor, never had children of her own, a conscious decision because of her career.

'Ian and I both work very hard. I’ve trained and worked in healthcare, specialising in paediatrics since I was 19. I have a wonderful niece, two nephews and lots of children at the hospital to keep  me busy.'

Rosie is adamant that she wouldn’t be able to provide such high standards of care without the help of her colleagues. 'I couldn’t be nearly so flexible without a strong team behind me.'

One member of that team is Vasanta Nanduri, a consultant paediatric oncologist who has worked with Rosie for the last 18 years. She says: 'She’s my right hand, a great friend with far too much energy and someone I trust implicitly.

'But it’s her knowledge and dedication to the children which is so impressive. She works out of hours, late into the night. She rarely takes a holiday, even though we try to make her. If she does, she writes 50-page handover notes. She’s a real inspiration. Everyone on the ward looks up to her.'

Sentiments echoed by Claire. 'It will be a sad day when Rosie retires and I feel sorry for the families who won’t get to meet her. We felt lucky every day that she was around and now we’ll always be reminded of her kindness by baby Rosie.'
