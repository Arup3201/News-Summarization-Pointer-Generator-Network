Shakespeare's plays contain their fair share of quarrelling princes – and now the Bard has sparked a real-life difference of opinion at the Palace.

Scholars have revealed that the Duke of Edinburgh believes the playwright did not write everything attributed to him – in opposition to Prince Charles.

Expert Stanley Wells, who has written in defence of Shakespeare’s authorship, last night said he had ‘crossed swords’ with Prince Philip on the issue.

Crossing swords: Prince Philip believes not all plays attributed to Shakespeare were his, a scholar claims

He recalled asking the Prince if he was a heretic, only to be told ‘all the more so after reading your book’.

According to Wells, Prince Philip believes it’s more likely that some plays were written by diplomat Sir Henry Neville, who was imprisoned in the Tower of London over a 1601 rebellion.

Other theories have suggested that Francis Bacon or Christopher Marlowe may also have been the true authors.

Another expert, Professor Jonathan Bate, revealed that Prince Charles, president of the Royal Shakespeare Company, had asked him to list arguments backing the Bard as author.

He said: ‘I have got a hunch he wanted some arguments to put in front of his dad. I know he has the orthodox position on this.’

Much ado: There has long been a row among scholars about whether Shakespeare wrote all his works
