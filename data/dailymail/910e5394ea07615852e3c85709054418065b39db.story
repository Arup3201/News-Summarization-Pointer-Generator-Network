Forget going under the knife, if you want to show off a bountiful cleavage on the beach this summer then Ultimo say they have the answer.

The lingerie brand promise to boost women by two cup sizes with their 'boob job' bikini.

Following on from the success of their 'OMG Plunge Bra' the company are responding to demand from their customers who want to be body confident on their summer holidays.

Instant lift: Ultimo model Rebecca Donaldson said the bikini boosted her bust from a 32B to a 32D

But rather than resort to expensive surgery to get a lift, Ultimo offers the same effect for £30 with their bikini top, which is available in hot pink and cobalt shades. Matching briefs cost £14.

They create the uplifting effect using in-built gel technology which is integrated into a foam cup.

The bikinis go on sale today in sizes 32A to 3DD and eight to 18 for the briefs.

Rebecca Donaldson, who modelled the bikini for the Ultimo campaign, said she was impressed with the way the swimwear boosted her cleavage from a 32B to an ample 32D.

The model from Perth, Scotland, said: 'I've always been flat chested and wanted bigger boobs, 
but I would never consider anything as drastic as going under the knife.
 When I put the bikini on for the first time, it took a bit of getting 
used to - as I suddenly had boobs - but the effect was amazing. I was 
definitely a full two cup sizes bigger and my cleavage was really 
natural looking.'

Ultimo founder Michelle Mone OBE, is also pleased with the design and has already been pictured in a similar style for previous advertising campaigns.

Boob job bikini: The hot pink and cobalt blue tops cost £30 each - a lot less than a real boob job

Meanwhile the matching briefs costs £14 available from size 8 to 18

She said: 'This is the bikini of all bikinis. For girls that lack volume in the cleavage department, this is an instantaneous, natural-looking boost for the bust and as effective as a boob job.

'The most important thing about this design is that the internal gel is light as a feather, so you barely notice the extra volume at all, but you have the benefit of being a whole two cups sizes bigger. For women who are an A or B cup, this is an absolute godsend and an Ultimo holiday must-have.'

A recent survey published on MailOnline found more than half of British women hate their bodies - and would rather forgo a holiday then dare to bare in a bikini.

These swimsuits are also part of the new collection and cost £40. The suit has a tummy control panel for anyone self-conscious about their stomach

Thanks to the rise of instantly sharing snaps on social media, many fear being seen not just on the beach but online in their swimwear.

But Michelle believes their bikini can give a self-esteem boost as well as a cleavage one to self-conscious Brits.

She said: 'Looking good on the beach or by the pool has never been so important - and this is the perfect solution to create incredible curves.'

The new collection also includes a swimsuit with a tummy control panel for anyone who doesn't want to show off their stomach.

Michelle says the right fit and style is important to showcase your best assets

SIZE MATTERS: Any good swimwear brand will size by cups, so think of swimwear as an extension of your lingerie drawer - make sure that it fits properly! It is vital for a woman to be expertly fitted on a regular basis, and I recommend every six months. Once you know the right size, then it's easy for you to try on different shapes and strap solutions. Don't be afraid to ask for assistance and let the experts advise on the best styles to boost your assets.

EXPERIMENT: Swimwear is similar to a good pair of jeans - you have to try on a lot before you find one that's "just right." If you think a bikini is the only way to look sexy on the beach, think again; a great tankini or one-piece that shows less skin can be equally flattering and look just as hot. There's also lots of trickery nowadays, from gel cups to add a little boost to slimming mesh panels to streamline your silhouette. Experiment with various shapes and styles no matter how young or old you are.

BE BOLD: I'm all for experimenting with colour. Bold shades look just beautiful in the sunshine and can really highlight a gorgeous golden tan. Be brave and go bright!

WATCH YOUR BACK: Don't forget to look at yourself from the back, beware of saggy bottoms or briefs that disappear when you walk - that's not a good look. The backside view counts as much as the front, especially in swimwear!

BE STYLE SAVVY: I think every woman should invest in a good quality one piece as a basic summer staple. It's a timeless piece, and although trends may come and go, this classic shape never goes out of style and will reappear in your suitcase year after year.

SHOP ONLINE: If you just don't feel comfortable stripping off and shopping for swimwear in store, why not browse online? There’s a lot to choose from out there so be adventurous, as you might be surprised at what suits! Order what takes your fancy or the styles that you like, and try them on in the luxury of your own home. Although make sure to check return or exchange policies on everything you purchase online beforehand so that you can return whatever you don't like.

ACCESSORISE: The glamour stakes on the beach have shot up in recent years so remember to accessorise and look out for lovely detailing in swimwear like brushed gold accents that add a little touch of luxury.

MAKE THE MOST OF WHAT YOU'VE GOT: So, you don't have the body of a swimsuit model - don't get stressed because nobody's perfect and most people don’t. Downplay your less-loved parts and focus on what you do have, accentuate those bits and you’ll feel a million dollars no matter where you are soaking up the sun this summer.
