Cristiano Ronaldo's four-year-old son still has no idea who his mother is, and his family have no intention of telling him.

Ronaldo's sister, Elma, revealed that Cristiano Jnr, sometimes known as Cristianinho, has stopped asking about his mum after they told him she was dead.

The Real Madrid star, 29, had the child with an unknown woman, believed to be a surrogate, in 2010.

Upbringing: Ronaldo's mother Dolores has helped raise the child in the absence of his mum

Elma said: 'Once we told him she was in Heaven, but my brother and mum asked us not to repeat it.

'We say now his mum went traveling. He goes silent, forgets about at and doesn't ask any more.'

Cristianinho lives with Ronaldo and his mum Dolores in Spain. She has recently released an official biography in which she said that the footballer insisted: The mum will never be known'. 

However, Elma added: 'If later on 
Cristianinho wants to know who his biological mum is, it will be his 
decision and no one’s going to stop it.'
