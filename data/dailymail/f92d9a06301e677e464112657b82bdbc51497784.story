Army medics are being recruited to help fill nursing vacancies at Colchester General Hospital

Army medics are being drafted in to help fill nursing gaps at a hospital plunged into special measures amid concerns over cancer waiting times.

Colchester Hospital University NHS Foundation Trust which runs the town's general hospital and Essex County Hospital, has more than 215 nursing vacancies at the moment. 

The trust was placed in special measures in 2013 amid allegations that staff were being forced to change cancer waiting times.

And last month Colchester General Hospital was rated inadequate by the health watchdog, the Care Quality Commission. 

The trust has introduced a series of initiatives in a bid to address the staffing shortfall.

Additional bank staff from other agencies will also continue to fill shifts. 

But now, bosses are hoping to draw on a long-standing agreement with troops stationed in the Essex town. 

Combat medical technicians from 16 Medical Regiment, based at Colchester Garrison, will work at the hospital when they are not on duty.

It is understood they will predominantly be deployed in A&E and other urgent care areas.

An agreement has been reached, the hospital said, but the number of army medics taking part has yet to be finalised.

A trust spokesman said: 'We have been talking to Colchester Garrison about the possibility of using their combat medical technicians as bank nurses.

'The garrison has been supportive of this and has said that, as long as the individual medics' commanding officer is happy for them to work here on the bank when they are off duty, it's fine by them.' 

He added that those medics leaving the Army are being targeted as part of the trust's recruitment drive.

Colchester MP Sir Bob Russell, welcomed the plans. 

He said: 'When I visited the hospital last month, in the wake of concerns over staffing levels with particular reference to accident and emergency, I suggested an approach be made to 16 Medical Regiment for mutual aid.

'I did so in the knowledge, from my visits to the field hospital at Camp Bastion in Helmand Province, Afghanistan, that many of the medics were members of the Army Reserve who worked for the NHS.

'Army medics would get continuing real-life situations to deal with, and the public would have additional qualified medical personnel to assist the hospital. 

'This really is a win-win situation.'

A Colchester Garrison spokesman told the Ipswich Star: 'There are long-standing arrangements in place for personnel from Colchester-based 16 Medical Regiment to carry out clinical placements at both Colchester General Hospital and Ipswich Hospital.

'With the permission of their chain of command and provided it does not interfere with their military duties, soldiers are able to take on additional work in their spare time.'

Separately, as part of a large recruitment drive, the trust has offered 48 jobs to Filipino nurses, 40 of whom have accepted.

As they are not EU citizens, they cannot start work straight away. In addition, between mid-October and February 9, 25 UK registered nurses have agreed to join the trust.

During a board meeting on Thursday, trust bosses outlined plans to become a 'much more flexible trust' for nurses.

Lynn Lane, director of human resources, said: 'We're no longer saying 'no' to people just because they can't do a Tuesday or Wednesday morning.

'We are thinking of much more creative ways to ensure we are being as flexible as possible.'
