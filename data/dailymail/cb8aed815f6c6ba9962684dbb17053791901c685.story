A scaffolding firm has been hit with a £5,000 fine after photographs emerged of a worker dangling his legs over the edge of one of its dangerous structures.

JOS Scaffolding Ltd risked the lives of its workers and passers-by on a busy central London street by failing to secure boards on their five-storey platforms and not setting up safety rails.

The London-based company was carrying out work on Tavistock Street in Aldwych, Central London - where pedestrians were so concerned they took pictures of the precariously-perched workers and sent them to safety authorities.

Dangling: Health and safety authorities were sent this picture of a worker precariously perched on top of a five-storey-high scaffolding

When the Health and Safety Executive (HSE) received the images they investigated the company, and found the work was 'poorly planned' and that two of the workers were untrained.

HSE said the pictures, take on June 20 last year, showed workers using unsecure and 'precariously balanced' boards to pass materials to higher levels.

They also showed a worker sitting near the top of the five storey structure, casually dangling his legs over the side.

JOS Scaffolding Limited, of Gray's Inn Road, London, was fined £5,000 and ordered to pay £734 in costs after pleading guilty at Westminster Magistrates' Court to two breaches of the Work at Height Regulations 2005.

After the hearing, HSE Inspector Andrew Verrall-Withers said: 'Scaffolding work is fraught with risk and can be extremely dangerous if it isn't carried out properly.

'The standards here were sorely lacking and the photographic evidence speaks for itself in terms of the risks taken.

Concern: A member of the public took these photographs showing the scaffolding - which inspectors said was 'sorely lacking' in safety features

'None of the missing measures, such as guard rails and secured boards and ladders, were difficult to provide, and there was no excuse.

'It isn't just the workers themselves who could end up getting seriously hurt or killed.

'People should be able to walk along a pavement without having to worry about a piece of scaffold slipping from the hands of an overhead worker.

'Thankfully nobody was injured, but that doesn't detract from JOS Scaffolding failing to ensure the work at height was properly planned, managed and executed in a safe manner.

'I would like to thank the concerned member of the public who brought the matter to our attention and who provided such clear visual evidence'.
