When Britain's most famous new town Milton Keynes was built in 1967 it quickly became the target of ridicule for its soulless buildings and grid systems.

But even its infamous concrete cows have not put off developers from attempting to build Britain's biggest new town.

Plans have today been revived for the creation of Northstowe, a 10,000 home development northwest of Cambridge.

Plans: An artist's impression of Northstowe, the new Cambridgeshire town which, if it goes ahead, could house up to 25,000 people

Development: Northstowe will have 150 houses built in the initial phase, followed by 650 by 2016

The town, which was once seen as the prototype for Labour's now-abandoned ecotown programme, could take up to two decades to complete and could be home to up to 25,000 people.

The initial phase of development for the town will see the creation of a primary school, sports hub, shops and a recycling centre.

The joint promoters of the Northstowe project, Gallagher and the Homes and Communities Agency, consulted with the public before submitted plans for 1,500 new homes today.

Ambitious: The plans for Northstowe could take up to 25 years to fully complete

Developers hope that as well as providing green, sustainable homes, Northstowe will also have a mix of executive homes, as well as low-cost and social housing.

Tim Wotherspoon, South Cambridgeshire 
District Council's cabinet member for Northstowe and new communities, 
said: 'We are delighted the application for the first phase of new homes
and community facilities at Northstowe has now been submitted as the 
town is vital to responding to the acute housing need in south 
Cambridgeshire.

'It will bring with it new jobs, a major boost for our flourishing economy, and will help address the need for affordable homes.

'We
are very clear that the proposals must be best for existing and future 
communities and the views of our residents are key to that.

'This is to be our new town and all of us locally are determined to make it work well for everyone.'

South Cambridgeshire District Council will now work with Cambridgeshire County Council to assess the application.

Big plans: Northstowe will be the biggest new town built in this country since Milton Keynes in the 1960s

Northstowe
Parish Forum - a group of 12 local parish councils near to the proposed
new town - have helped with the preparation of the plan.

A decision on the plans is expected to take up to a year.

Plans for Northstowe's second phase will be prepared over the summer, while later developments would include a town centre and a secondary school.

Steve Collins, the Homes and Communities Agency area manager, said: 'The joint promoters are confident Northstowe can be delivered and have adopted a new phased approach to delivering housing as part of the comprehensive development of the wider vision for Northstowe as a new community.

'Gallagher submitting the phase one application is fully supported by the HCA as it is part of the revised master plan for the whole site, the majority of which HCA owns. Itâ€™s therefore a major milestone for the project as a whole.

Inspiration? Milton Keynes now has a population of over 230,000 after it was made in 1967

Iconic: The concrete cows built in Milton Keynes have become a landmark in the Buckinghamshire town

'We remain committed to delivering Northstowe with all the benefits it will bring to the local and wider area and together the joint promoters will be working together on preliminary plans for a phase two over the summer.'

Northstowe, built five miles north-west of Cambridge, will be the UK's biggest new town since Milton Keynes.

The
town, known as MK to locals, was formally designated a town in 1967, 
having incorporated the existing towns of Bletchley, Wolverton and Stony
Stratford.

Arguably the biggest (and perhaps only) landmark in Milton Keynes is the collection of concrete cows, which were built in 1978 by American artist Liz Leyh. She is thought to have created them as a leaving present to the Milton Keynes Development Corporation before she returned to the U.S.

The Buckinghamshire town was created to help ease housing overspill in London, and now has a population of around 232,000.
