A police dog named Copper has been credited for saving the life of a missing 6-year-old Utah boy who accidentally fell into an open manhole and became trapped underground.

Kollin Bailey presented a large bone and a stocking full of doggie treats to his new four-legged friend on Saturday, a day after his ordeal in cold darkness about 10 feet below ground.

'He saved my life,' the boy told KUTV-TV, echoing his parents' belief.

Kollin went missing from his Herriman home Friday evening. He was supposed to be playing at the neighbor's house, but instead, he ended up at the bottom of a nine-foot manhole

After he was reported missing Friday afternoon, the 6-year-old bloodhound tracked his scent to the manhole in Kollin's hometown of Herriman, about 25 miles south of Salt Lake City.

Police said the boy spent three to four hours there until he was located Friday night. An officer then descended the hole to lift him out.

'I was really scared ... I thought I was going to miss Christmas,' Kollin said.

Kollin, who suffered a broken arm and mild concussion, said he was flying a kite when he tripped and fell into the manhole.

K9 teams from the West Valley City Police Department were called to assist, including Sgt. Shane Matheson and bloodhound Copper

Kollin spent two hours alone in the hole and could have been there much longer. 'I thought I was going to miss Christmas', the 6-year-old boy said

'I was looking back at my kite and I fell, then I blacked out. And when I opened my eyes, I was in there,' he told the Dessert News.

When he didn't come home his mother got worried.

Shara Bailey, Kollin's mother, 'I just kept falling over last night. I just couldn't stand because I was so scared.'

Kollin was yelling for help, but he was in such a seculded spot that nobody could hear him. 

Kollin Bailey, 'My mom and dad couldn't hear me.'

Fortunately, bloodhounds don't rely on sound. They go for smell.

It’s hard to hear anybody in the area where Kollin fell. Fortunately, bloodhounds don’t rely on sound; they go for smell and Kollin was found within minutes after the search began

It was a special meeting for six year-old Kollin Bailey, as he came face to face with Copper the bloodhound

The dog's handler, West Valley City police Sgt. Shane Matheson, said it only took Copper about 20 minutes to lead him to the manhole once they joined the search. They began their search from where Kollin's bicycle was found.

'Kollin was pretty relieved he had been found,' Matheson told The Salt Lake Tribune. 'He said he thought he had been down there seven hours.'

Fortunately, Kollin was okay. His family took him to the hospital. He has a broken arm and scratches.

It is unknown why the manhole was uncovered, but Herriman officials believe someone had tampered with the cover. Maintenance crews had not been to the area for quite some time. 

Shawn Bailey, 'My son's life goes out to them. Because he wouldn't be with us today if we didn't have those K-9 units and great police officers.' 

It was all in a day's work for Copper, who has tracked down 81 suspects and missing people, Matheson added.

'To him it is just a game of hide and seek,' he said. 'It's kind of a nice change of pace from finding bad guys to actually helping a family out.'

'I was telling everybody at the hospital last night, 'That dog is going to get the biggest bone he's ever gotten for Christmas,' said Kollin's father

By Saturday morning, Kollin and his family had gone through an emotional 24 hours. 'I was flying my kite, and I think I saw a rock and I think I tripped over it and fell into the hole', Kollin said

Kollin’s mother, Shara Bailey, said they began looking for him. She said she was afraid for her child. 'I had thought the worst, you know? You always wonder how do people go to sleep at night without their babies home? And I was terrified I was going to have to,' she said

Today the family is just thankful, for the efforts and kindness of their neighborhood, that their child was found and only suffered a broken arm. They said they are especially grateful for Copper and Sgt Matheson

Kollin’s time in the hole probably lasted three to four hours. A police officer jumped down the hole and lifted the boy up to other officers

When Kollin first hugged his mom after being rescued from the hole, she said he was most concerned about missing Christmas
