Anysha Panesar, from the Vale of Glamorgan, was given a celebrity lifestyle funded by her father's insurance business

A big-spending father who showered his teenage daughter with luxuries - including a £20,000 Super Sweet 16 birthday party which was filmed for television  - has been fined more than £200,000.

Schoolgirl Anysha Panesar, now 19, from the Vale of Glamorgan,  was given a celebrity lifestyle funded by her father's insurance business.

But the court heard father Harby Panesar's financial empire crumbled - leaving him bankrupt and banned from trading. 

Anysha - who featured on reality television programme My Super Sweet 16 - had a lavish 16th birthday bash with a personal video from Hollywood star Nicole Kidman and guest singer Tulisa from N-Dubz.

Her businessman father, 45, then bankrolled her dream to be a top teenage model and beauty queen.

Anysha went on to be crowned America's Perfect Teen - and became the first international cover girl on SuperModels magazine.

But less than three years later Panesar was declared bankrupt when his finance business collapsed.

He was hauled up in front of the High Court in London after he set up a new company in defiance of court orders.

The insurance broker was let off jail but was yesterday fined £212,000 after a Financial Services Authority investigation.

He was also banned from working in the industry after they found he'd left thousands of customers without the breakdown cover they had paid for.

Tracey McDermott, The regulator's director of enforcement and financial crime, said: 'Harbinder Panesar has left a trail of destruction behind him.

'He was misappropriating funds from his businesses, acting recklessly towards consumers, and taking two firms into liquidation.

'So egregious were his actions that even though he has only recently been discharged from bankruptcy, we will not reduce the fine because of financial hardship.

'Such dishonesty and recklessness not only posed a risk to consumers but also to other market participants and to confidence in the financial system as a whole.

'Panesar is learning the hard way that we will not stand for this kind of activity.'

Panesar doted on Anysha, lavishing her with gifts and encouraging her to live a life of luxury.He bought his daughter a Gucci handbag for her birthday, along with a £1,500 personalised mobile phone and a pair of £400 sunglasses.

He threw a Moulin Rouge-themed party and Anysha wore a £3,000 replica of a Nicole Kidman dress from the hit film.

Musicians N-Dubz and DJ Ironik provided entertainment while there was a £500 rotating Moulin Rouge cake.

At the time of her birthday party, he said: 'If any parents are going to have a Super Sweet 16 party I would suggest that they have very long pockets and very long arms to reach in to those pockets.'

But Panesar financial empire crashed after it was discovered he had left 6,000 customers without the motor breakdown insurance cover they had paid for.

He was found to have misappropriated more than £180,000 from his two car insurance firms - Motorcare Elite and Motorcare Warranties.

Panesar was hauled up in front of the High Court in London where he was let off jail after Anysha, now 19, begged the Judge in a personal letter not to send her father to prison.

Panesar, 45, who lives with wife Caroline, 43, in a luxury £500,000 home and six-acre estate in the Vale of Glamorgan, has recently been discharged from bankruptcy.

But the Financial Services Authority said that they would put him back into bankruptcy if he couldn't pay the fine.
