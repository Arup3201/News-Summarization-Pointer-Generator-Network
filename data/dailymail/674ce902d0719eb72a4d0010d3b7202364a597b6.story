The Bahrain Grand Prix was a tough battle. On one hand it was extremely exciting during the race – some of the best racing that I have been part of in a long, long time – but then afterwards, I was disappointed because I don't like coming second, especially not to my team-mate!

However, there was a small part of me which remained proud because I started to understand what a great show we had put on, and that I had managed to contribute to that show, thus elevating my sport – the sport of Formula One into people's awareness, and boosting its popularity.

That is important to me because I want F1 to be the most exciting sport in the world. The disappointment of coming second was the overriding factor, however.

During the race you would have heard me communicate to my team about a battle with Lewis Hamilton, where I said his driving was 'not on', because I thought in one particular battle he was over the limit. But it wasn't a big issue, that´s racing and we have special emotions during a race. Sometimes you shout in your helmet. But the important thing is that it has since been discussed. 

We went through everything as a team on Thursday afternoon, here in Shanghai, and that's what we do always; it's not just because of what happened in Bahrain. We always discuss these sort of things as a team because it is important that we put it behind us and move forward as a team and that is exactly what we have done.

So, the exciting Bahrain weekend is now behind us, and we move on full speed, keep racing and going flat out which is great, and it is fantastic and I am thankful to Mercedes that they let us race like that.

It is great for the sport, great for us drivers, and great for everybody – even though Mercedes are taking a risk by doing that because it increases the chance that we have a collision.

I think my rivalry with Lewis is great. If we can keep it up and have battles like we did in Bahrain then it is exciting for us and exciting for the sport, so it is something I see in a positive light as long as I come out on top next time!

I was the quicker guy in Bahrain, so that was a real positive and I must keep the momentum going and the win will come, so it is all about making the most of the speed we have at the moment. 

Second best: Rosberg admits he was 'disappointed' to finish behind team-mate Hamilton at the Bahrain race

Coming to China, I have some great memories here, winning my first Formula One race two years ago, and the first for the Silver Arrows in the new era – 57 years after Mercedes' last victory as a works team. It was a special moment that day, and to win my first race was also great.

I've had some good races at the Shanghai International Circuit – it is a track that I enjoy coming to. It is a unique track because where we normally destroy the rear tyres, here we destroy the front tyres instead, so you have to adapt completely with a different set-up and knowing what to expect, so it requires a lot of change which is unusual and provides us with a challenge.

In saying that, I expect us to be the dominating force here because we are very quick at the moment and I don't expect anybody to close the gap from Bahrain to here.

I see it as a straight fight between myself and Lewis for the win in Shanghai, but let's take it step-by-step. 

This year will be a development race. 
Red Bull is still the benchmark in the sport and they can develop 
rapidly, but definitely at the moment we are dominating and I am 
expecting another straight fight with my team-mate this weekend.

The long straights come to our advantage in Shanghai; the Mercedes power unit is the strongest in F1 at the moment and the most efficient – Mercedes have done an awesome job with that, and our car, too. It is looking good aerodynamically and weight wise, we have got the weight under control, so when all of that comes together we have got a great package.

I am looking forward to the weekend and to keep on maximising what I have and trying to make the most of it because I am here to win and I have a chance to win. That really is a big boost, and provides us with great momentum within the team.

I am proud to be a part of this momentum. I have been here since day one – from 2010 – day one of the Mercedes project of the new era – and I have been through the tough times and the struggles, but now we are finally reaping the benefits of all the hard work over the years, the restructuring, all the improvements that we have made as a team – so I have to make the most of it and really enjoy the moment.

Coming second in Bahrain was disappointing, especially to team-mate Lewis Hamilton
