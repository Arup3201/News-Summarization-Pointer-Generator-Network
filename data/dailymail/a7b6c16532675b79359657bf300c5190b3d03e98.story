He's only just announced his plans to leave the Army but a new poll has revealed that the majority of Britons want Prince Harry to get back to work.

But it isn't more royal duties that most have in mind. Instead, more than half say the Prince should combine official work with an 'ordinary' job.

Harry is currently a captain in the Blues and Royals but will leave the Army this summer after a stint seconded to the Australian Defence Force.

New job: The majority of Britons think Prince Harry should get another 'ordinary' job

Retirement: Harry announced that he will leave the Army this summer earlier this week

Deployment: Harry, who did two tours of duty in Afghanistan, will now spend four weeks with the Australian Defence Force in Sydney and Perth

The 30-year-old is due to fly to Australia next month and will follow his month-long deployment with an official tour of New Zealand.

He will also travel back to this side of the world half way through to mark the Gallipoli centenary at a ceremony in Turkey alongside the Prince of Wales.

Despite calls for the Prince to get a regular job, the majority of Britons say leaving the Army is the right decision.

56 per cent of those questioned by pollsters YouGov said the royal has made the right choice, compared to just eight per cent opposed.

Harry, who has consistently topped royal popularity polls, was also deemed a good role model by the majority of those asked, with 61 per cent saying he is.

An enthusiastic 22 per cent said the Prince is a 'very good' role model, with just four per cent saying he is a bad one and two per cent opting for 'very bad'.

Although only 16 per cent believe Harry should concentrate exclusively on royal duties, his future beyond next autumn remains unclear.

Along with announcing his decision to leave the Army, a statement from Kensington Palace revealed the Prince will travel to Africa this summer to take part in conservation and charity work.

Yesterday, it was revealed that Harry will follow that with participation in the 1,000 mile 'Walk of Britain' alongside injured soldiers supported by Walking with the Wounded.

The trek will be the third Walking with the Wounded expedition for Harry, who previously joined servicemen battling their way to the North Pole in 2011 and the South Pole in 2013.

Role model: Harry, who regularly tops royal popularity charts, is also considered a good role model by most

Speaking at the event yesterday, Harry reiterated his commitment to helping wounded veterans and also revealed that leaving the military would be 'challenging' for him.

'The public’s support for our Armed Forces continues to be extraordinary,' he added. 'However, as the memory of our military commitments in Iraq and Afghanistan fade, we must encourage people to continue supporting our servicemen and women; particularly those who are seeking to transition into civilian life.

'This process can be challenging, as it is for anyone seeking a new career. As I make this transition myself, I'm determined to do all I can to help others.'
