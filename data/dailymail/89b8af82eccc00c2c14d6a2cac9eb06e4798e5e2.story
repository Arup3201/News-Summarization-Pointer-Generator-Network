David Craggs is headteacher at the Gad's Hill School in Higham, Kent

A headteacher of a private school has been accused of giving himself a 381 per cent pay rise over 11 years taking his salary to £169,000.

David Craggs is headteacher at the Gad’s Hill School in Higham, Kent, which was once the country home of author Charles Dickens.

The Charity Commission, which oversees the school because of its charitable status, is awaiting a response from trustees to 'serious' concerns it has raised over the alleged misappropriation of funds.

It also alleged that Mr Craggs made up to 20 purchases using school bank cards which may not have had approval from governors.

John
 Melville resigned as chairman of the board of governors in April and 
said he was now free to speak out about his concern over the school's 
finances 'as opposed to toeing the line'.

Two other governors left the following month, both also mentioning financial concerns in their letters of resignation.

Mr Melville said he was 'bitterly disappointed, angry and upset' over the allegations.

The governors are responsible for finances but the head has day-to-day control of the money.

Mr Craggs reportedly began as headteacher of the school in 2000 on £35,130 a year, but by 2011 was being paid £168,985 having allegedly been free to set his own salary.

A former employee of the £10,000-a-year school blew the whistle in March 2012 and an internal review was carried out.

It concluded Mr Craggs 'had not breached any school policy or procedure and therefore would not be subjected to any disciplinary process.'

Data published by the Department for Education shows that 900 school leaders in England are paid at least £100,000 this year.

According to figures, some 300 heads are being paid £110,000 or more – around three times the salary of the average teacher.

The average salary of a school leader at any type of state school now stands at £56,100.

In comparison, David Cameron earns around £142,500.

The Charity Commission was informed of the result and according to a statement from Gad’s Hill’s acting chair of governors Kirsty Hillocks, 'concluded the school may need to review some of its internal procedures' but that it had 'acted appropriately' and 'no further action' was required.

But the commission was not told of allegations over Mr Craggs’ use of school credit cards, which have emerged since Mr Melville spoke out.

It is now waiting for a response from the trustees before deciding whether to take any action against the school in Gad’s Hill Place, where Charles Dickens lived for the last 14 years of his life.

A spokesman for the school said it was 'unfortunate Mr Melville has felt the need to speak to the media when he had full knowledge of the school’s finances during his 17 years as a school governor.

'The media are focusing on the financial management of the school which is something Mr Melville, in his role as chairman of governors and also vice chair of the finance committee, had control and oversight of throughout his tenure.'

Ms Hillocks added that Mr Craggs 'deservedly has the full confidence of school staff and the governing body.'

Mr Craggs was elected to be a Conservative councillor in Medway, Kent, in 2010 but was forced to resign just two weeks later because it he also served as a Special Constable in North Kent. 

At the time he said in a statement: 'People will know that I have served as a volunteer special constable on behalf of the people of Kent for the past 17 years, a role that I have held with pride. 

'In the hope that I could expand my community service I stood as a councillor for Medway. 

'I did not believe there was any conflict between these roles and was unaware that police regulations prevent anyone from holding political office whilst also serving the police.

'It is a pity that I have to stand down as a councillor. However, I have faithfully served the people of Kent as a special constable for the past 17 years and wish to continue to do so for many years to come.

'I now look forward to continuing my duties as a special constable in the service of the people of Kent and Medway.'
