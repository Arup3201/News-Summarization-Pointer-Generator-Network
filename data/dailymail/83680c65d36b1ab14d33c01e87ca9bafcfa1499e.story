Liverpool will hope to have signed a lucky charm in Lazar Markovic.

The Serbia midfielder, who joined the Anfield outfit on a £20million deal on Tuesday, has been a champion in each of his four seasons as a professional footballer.

Markovic, 20, joined Partizan Belgrade as a 12-year-old trainee before making his debut in the final game of the 2010-2011 campaign.

The following season, he signed a five-year deal with the Serbian champions before playing a prevalent role in helping them retain their crown.

Markovic was voted Partizan's Player of the Year on the club's website. He was also named in the SuperLiga Team of the Year – a feat he repeated the following season as Partizan secured their third consecutive title.

A move to Benfica ensued for Markovic and his title-winning prowess continued after he helped the Portuguese side finish seven points clear of Sporting Lisbon.

And the Serb, whose arrival has taken Liverpool’s spending towards the £60m mark following the arrivals of Rickie Lambert and Adam Lallana from Southampton and Emre Can from Bayer Leverkusen, is confident of tasting more success with the Premier League giants, who finished two points behind Manchester City last season.

'I hope that I will fulfil the expectations of the supporters, coaches, players and all connected to the club,' he said.

'I have seen what the players are like, I have seen what the supporters are like, and I cannot wait to start playing here.

'I want to win titles with Liverpool and I will give 100 per cent on the pitch.

'I watched every Liverpool game last season and they played absolutely superb. It is a shame they did not win the title and I hope we will win it this season.'
