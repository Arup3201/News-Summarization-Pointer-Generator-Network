A mother-of-two has lost eight stone in weight after pledging to give herself a new body for her 50th birthday.

Diane Purdey, from Poole, once wore size 26 clothing and weighed 21st 12lb.

But she banished biscuits and unhealthy food from her diet after deciding she did not want her 50th birthday celebrations to be marked by ill health.

She said: 'I reached the point in my life where I'd had enough of being the size that I was. I knew I had a special birthday coming up and I had to do something.

'I wanted to look good in photos and feel proud of myself.'

Diane, now 51, lost control of her weight in the years after she gave birth to her sons Russell, 29, and Ian, 27.

She said: 'I had only been a stone overweight before I had children.

'Over the years my eating habits just got worse and the weight crept on. I could eat half a large packet of Jaffa cakes or half a full-sized loaf of tiger bread for a snack, and I didn't take any exercise.

'I'd tried to lose weight a few times never got near my goal so had given up.'

Her steadily declining health caused doctors to prescribe tablets to ease her high blood pressure and by June 2012 she was suffering with nagging pain in her joints caused by poor diet and inactivity.

She decided to join her local branch of Slimming World with her husband Trevor, 53, a mechanical engineer.

She said: 'My birthday was four months away and I doubted whether I would be able to make a meaningful difference, but it was very helpful to have Trevor there with me in the early days.'

In the first week of her new eating programme, she lost 9lb.

By the time her husband surprised her with a dream holiday to Mexico for her 50th birthday, Diane had made significant changes

Four months later, by the time her husband surprised her with a dream holiday to Mexico to mark her 50th birthday, Diane had made significant changes to her diet and lifestyle and had already lost an impressive four stone in weight.

Before she began her new regime, Diane typically ate sugary cereal for breakfast, followed by chicken mayonnaise sandwiches for lunch with pie and chips for evening meal, with biscuits as snacks throughout the day.

Today, she eats Weetabix for breakfast, followed by sushi for lunch and fish with rice for an evening meal. She has replaced sugary snacks with pieces of fruit.

Breakfast: Sugary cereal

Lunch: Chicken mayo sandwiches

Dinner: Pie and chips

Breakfast: Weetabix

Lunch: Sushi

Dinner: Fish and rice

Snacks: Fruit

Diane now weighs 13st 9lb and wears size 16 clothes. She is now determined to lose the final pounds to reach her target weight of 13st.

In an incredible turnaround, she has also been taken off medication for high blood pressure, having relied on daily tablets for the previous ten years.

She now runs five kilometres every Saturday and has started her own mid-week running club. She also cycles and attends dancing classes with her husband, who has lost more than two stone since starting his own weight loss journey.

Diane, an accounts administrator, said: 'I'm so happy to have achieved all I have. When I look back at the photos how big I became I'm quite ashamed of how bad I let things get.

'Now, I try to encourage people around me to eat healthier. I want other people to realise what they can do if they put their minds to it.'

Diane, now 51, has managed to slim down even more - and, most importantly,Â  keep the weight off
