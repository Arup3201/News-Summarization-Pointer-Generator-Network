What started out as a New York City food phenomenon has spread, and it now taking over Asia.

South Koreans are the latest to catch the cronut-bug with incarnations of Dominique Ansel's original rings of deep-fried croissant dough being sold at Dunkin' Donuts franchises in Soeul.

DD South Korea is calling their versions of the crispy layered pastries 'New York Pie Donuts.'

The donuts are being sold at shops in Seoul, and have even inspired their own epically-long lines at the upscale Gangnam neighborhood branch.

According to Quartz, commenters on the store's Facebook page have even said that customers are only allowed two - the same ration New Yorkers get when they stand in the early morning lines at Dominique Ansel's bakery in SoHo.

Dunkin' Donuts has over 3,000 stores in 30 countries outside the U.S. Their shops in the Philippines also started selling versions of the cronut. Their 'Donut Croissant' come in flavors such as Apple Cinnamon and Choco Almond. The donut chain doesn't have plans to launch a version of the cronut in the U.S. yet, according to Quartz.

Since Dominique Ansel copyrighted the named 'cronut' in May, copycats in the U.S. have had to come up with their own names - like 'doissants' and 'croughnuts' - for their pastries or face cease and desist letters.

In June, the bakery posted a message on their Facebook page explaining their need to copyright the name, while at the same time taking no credit for inventing the pastry.

'Our desire to protect the name is not an attempt to claim or take credit for all cooking methods associated with the recipe or all croissant and doughnut products in general,' the statement said. 'Instead, it offers the bakery and Chef protection against un-granted affiliations with the bakery or confusion from customers.'

A spokesman for the bakery seemed unfazed by all of the cronut pretenders, in a statement to MailOnline.

'As an artisanal production, we believe customers can tell the difference between our products and what is mass produced, in the same way that they can differentiate a fresh-baked baguette made by a baker's hands and heart from a supermarket aisle product packaged in factories.'

But that hasn't stopped bakeries all over Asia, trying their best to create their own flaky bite of heaven.

A list on Buzzfeed includes bakeries in the Philippines, Hong Kong, Thailand, Indonesia, Singapore and Japan peddling their versions of the donut.Â
