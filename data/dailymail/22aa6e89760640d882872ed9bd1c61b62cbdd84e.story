Emre Can was bemused. Brendan Rodgers had been at his most effusive, purring about the German's ability, but his words were unwittingly lost in translation.

Eager to promote the giant strides Can had made, Rodgers delved into his lexicon and likened Liverpool's new No 23 to a Rolls-Royce, following a series of effortlessly smooth performances. When his manager's words were relayed, however, there was nothing more than a quizzical look.

'We wouldn't use that expression in Germany, we wouldn't say something like that,' says Can, taking up the story. 'I know a Rolls Royce is a big, luxurious car so I associated it with a positive comment, but I didn't know exactly what it meant. I hadn't heard the comparison before.

'Then again, I had a feeling it couldn't be so bad if the manager was saying something like that.'

This is the first time Can has faced the English media since his £10million arrival from Bayer Leverkusen and he smiles as he relays the anecdote. Initially, Can is withdrawn and lacking confidence but eventually, with the help of an interpreter, he emerges from his shell.

In some ways, this interview is a microcosm of how his Liverpool career has been to date. As part of the huge influx of new players last summer, Can failed to make an instant impact and in the early months of the campaign, he did nothing but float on the periphery.

Since Christmas, though, the landscape has changed dramatically, both for him and Liverpool. Playing on the right side of a three-man defence, Can has not looked back since his introduction as a half-time substitute at Burnley on Boxing Day.

'I was injured at the beginning of the season and then played against Chelsea (in November),' says Can, referring to a 2-1 defeat in which he scored Liverpool's goal. 'Then I was out of the team until December when I came on (at half-time) against Burnley.

'My attitude was not to moan or make a big fuss about it but to keep calm and work hard so that when I got the chance against Burnley I could break into the side. I feel very good feel I have the trust of the manager. I believe I'm doing a good job and that is why I am playing. I'm happy.'

Powerful and imposing, Can has a defender's physique but his qualities as a midfielder have drawn comparisons with Michael Ballack and Bastian Schweinsteiger. Given how he has been performing, it seems remarkable Bayern Munich allowed him to move on.

Bayern had an option to buy back their Academy graduate from Leverkusen but were content to let Liverpool have him. There are certainly no arguments about that decision at Anfield. Rodgers, for one, believes Can has the ability to 'play for any side in the world'.

Can, clearly, is going to be an important figure and an idea of how much the 21-year-old has backed himself to succeed is by the fact he asked to take over the 23 jersey that had been vacant since Jamie Carragher departed in May 2013.

'I did want the 23 because there was a high importance here, and I knew about it before I came,' he says. 'It is a big honour to wear it after Carragher retired but I don't feel any extra pressure because of it.'

So on to Sunday and the battle with Manchester United. Had things worked out differently, he could have been lining up against Liverpool, as the David Moyes regime scouted Can twice last season but, instead, he will be aiming to derail their top four ambitions.

'I am well aware United will be a tough game and I know about the rivalry,' says Can. 'We have a very young team and need to keep improving. But if we do, there will be good years. I am playing for one of the biggest clubs in the world. I have no regrets about coming here.'
