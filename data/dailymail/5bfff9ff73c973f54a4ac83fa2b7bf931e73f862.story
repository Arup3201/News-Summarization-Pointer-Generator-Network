Think bushy brows and you immediately think of Cara Delevinge - hers have even got their own Twitter account.

And now Cara has been credited with a surge in eyebrow pencil sales as women try to emulate her trademark look.

Experts say the English supermodel - known for her thick, dark eyebrows - is the reason for a 42 per cent increase in sales over the last 12 months.

It's all Cara's fault! New research reveals that sales of eyebrow pencils are up 42 per cent and it's all thanks to Miss Delevingne's bushy brows

Campaigns 
such as Dove’s ‘natural beauty’ and the #nomakeupselfie social media 
cancer awareness trend are also believed to be behind a rise in 
natural-look products.

An analyst
 at Mintel, which conducted the survey, said: 'Following on from the 
arches celebrated in the Game of Thrones TV series as well as the Cara 
effect, sales have been eyebrow-raising.

'Sales of eyebrow products reached £28 million in 2013, an impressive 42 per cent increase on 2012 sales, which were valued at £20 million.

'With a quarter of UK women now using eyebrow definer, this growth looks set to continue with sales predicted to reach £31 million in 2014, gaining a 7 per cent proportion of the eye colour cosmetics market.'

The analyst also noted that in 2013, fashion began to move towards a more natural look with ‘no-make-up-make-up’ becoming a popular trend.

'This has continued into 2014 with the #NoMakeupSelfie nominations on Facebook and products to enhance natural skin instead of covering it.

'Furthermore, as our research shows, the level of awareness of photoshop in face colour cosmetics advertising is high, this indicates the positive effect of real beauty campaigns from brands such as Dove, and retailers taking a stand against digitally altered images.'

Although 
top-end, designer make-up is growing faster than its mass market 
counterparts, analysts predict high-end sales will reach £552 million in
 2014 whereas high street make-up will total £1 billion.

Nearly 
half of shoppers buying facial make-up such as foundation agreed in a 
survey that photo-shopped models do not represent a look they can 
achieve at home, prompting them to buy muted colours to look more 
natural.

In the UK, 93 per cent of women buy make-up, with total sales increasing by six per cent last year to £1.5 billion.

Speaking about the results, Shavata, brow guru, said: 'The groomed bigger brow has remained popular because they frame the eyes and add structure to the face, as well as giving a more youthful appearance. 

'For anyone thinking about bigger brows, my advice is keep to your natural shape and do the best to enhance this feature, whilst remembering brows are not a feature of their own, (you don’t talk about the picture frame), they should silently frame the face.  

'If you are growing your brows I recommend leaving them for 6-8 weeks (or as long as you can bear) before going to see a professional to find your shape it will be worth it, then make the best of what you have. 

'To give achieve the look of a full brow at home, I recommend using the Shavata Double Ended Pencil to fill in any gaps, this pencil contains two shades – Dusk and Dawn. Filling in brows will make them look fuller and define the eye area. To apply, use soft, sweeping movements.

'With thicker brows a manicured look is still essential, as well as using a pencil an eyebrow gel is a must - not only will it brush hair but it also holds hair in place all day. My Eyebrow Tamer is great for this.'
