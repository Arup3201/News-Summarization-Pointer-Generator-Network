A 4-0 defeat to MK Dons is certainly not the way to introduce yourself to the Manchester United faithful - or to force your way into Louis van Gaal's first team plans.

United and Van Gaal succumbed to a humiliating hammering at the hands of the Dons at Stadium MK thanks to braces from Will Grigg and Benik Afobe, on loan from Arsenal.

Despite some impressive first half displays from United's youngsters, in the second period they appeared to crumble as Dons continued to grow stronger as the game progressed.

Here, Sportsmail gives you the lowdown on how United's youngsters fared.

Saidy Janko

Age: 18

Position: Right-back/right-wing

Profile: The Swiss U19 international signed for United on deadline day last summer having impressed the United coaching staff in the FIFA Blue Stars tournament.

He is big, athletic and strong and he loves to attack.

His presence on the field has quickly elevated him into Van Gaal's thinking and he has a chance of being on the fringes of the Dutchman's first-team squad this season. 

How did he play? Janko made his debut at right wing-back against MK Dons.

He was very strong and physical throughout and has shown he will not be bullied. However, he did give away two fouls in dangerous positions.

The 18-year-old also got forward reasonably well but wasted a good chance to cross the ball just before half-time when Adnan Januazj played him clear down the right-wing.

Replaced at half-time, he was slightly unfortunate to be sacrificed so early.

Strong: Saidy Janko looked extremely powerful and strong before being replaced at half-time by Louis van Gaal

Marnick Vermijl 

Age: 22

Position: Right-back 

Profile: The Belgian had not started for United in two years before the MK Dons match and he began the game in the unusual position as one of a back three.

He made his debut in September 2012 in a League Cup tie with Newcastle United before being loaned to Dutch side NEC Nijmegen, where he gained valuable experience as their first-choice right-back.

Vermijl is extremely versatile and can play anywhere across the back four, meaning Van Gaal could utilise his versatility this season in his 3-5-2 formation.

The 22-year-old loves to get forward and will not be shy at attacking if he was to be used in a wider position. 

Unconvincing: Marnick Vermijl is challenged by Benik Afobe in his first United appearance for two years

How did he play? Two years after his last appearance and Vermijl was not wholly convincing at left centre-back.

He was caught out with the ball in behind a couple of times and did not seem comfortable in a back three. 

Vermijl did make a couple of important defensive clearances in the first half, but unable to get across to cover Grigg for Dons' second goal. Totally misjudged the bounce of the ball for Afobe's second and allowed the Arsenal loanee in behind to score.

Michael Keane 

Age: 21

Position: Centre-back

Profile: Keane made his Premier League debut off the bench against Sunderland last weekend and slotted in fairly well into the back three at the Stadium of Light.

He is the brother of Will Keane, the striker, and has been on loan to Leicester City, Derby County and Blackburn Rovers in his career so far.

The 21-year-old was extremely highly regarded at Blackburn and featured prominently for them in the Championship.

He has scored three goals in 12 appearances for the England U21s and has been touted as a future full international. 

How did he play? Keane made his second appearance in a row as he started at right centre-back.

To use an old and awful cliche, it was a game of two halves for Keane.

He looked the most composed of the centre-halves in the opening 45 minutes, distributing the ball well and calming situations down.

But then in the second half he just seemed to wilt under Dons' pressure. Nowhere to be seen for Grigg's second goal - in a position he should have been covering - and regularly troubled as United tried to push as many bodies forward as possible. 

Competitive: Michael Keane looked composed at centre-back and willing to challenge both in the air and ground

Reece James 

Age: 20

Position: Left-back

Profile: The career of Reece James has been an interesting one.

The left-back was released by Preston North-End as an 18-year-old two years ago but he was handed a lifeline by United's reserve-team manager Warren Joyce.

He made more appearances for United's second-string last season than any other player. 

After being invited by Van Gaal to appear on the pre-season tour of the USA, James scored twice against LA Galaxy and impressed against Roma - bombing forward on every possible occasion.

He looks an exciting talent and, in a 3-5-2 formation, he could flourish at left wing-back. 

How did he play? Started at left wing-back. Always willing to get forward at every opportunity and offer himself as another striker. Sometimes a bit sloppy on the ball. Ran back towards his defence a couple of times, inviting pressure. Booked in the 50th minute for a very bad challenge where he dived in, seemingly from frustration.

Gave the ball away lazily to Afobe for the third goal and that sort of blotted an otherwise half-decent copybook for the night.

Just as he showed on United's pre-season tour to the US, James is willing to bomb forward at every opportunity and from an attacking point of view he looks a perfect fit at wing-back.

Unfortunately defensively he can have lapses of concentration and he put his side needlessly under pressure a couple of times. He was booked in the 50th minute for a very bad challenge as well.

Attacking: Reece James tried to get forward at every possible opportunity for Manchester United on Tuesday

Possession: James was willing to attack but also compete for the ball from his left wing-back position

Andreas Pereira 

Age: 18

Position: Attacking-midfielder

Profile: As opposed to the other five youngsters who tend to be defensively-minded, Pereira is an attacking option for Van Gaal.

He can operate anywhere in midfield but is more adept in an attacking capacity.

The Belgian-born Brazilian can operate as a No 8 or as a No 10 and he loves to take a set piece, regularly scoring for the younger-age groups.

The 18-year-old was signed from PSV Eindhoven youth and is extremely highly thought of at United. With the arrival of Angel di Maria he may struggle for opportunities, but he certainly gives his manager an option to take into consideration.

How did he play? Came on after 46 minutes for Janko. Looks very nice on the ball. Took a free-kick from the left-hand side of the box which just dipped over the bar, highlighting his confidence. Lovely flowing running and set up Welbeck for an effort just before the hour mark.

Flair: Attacking midfielder Andreas Pereira showed signs of creativity despite joining a sinking ship on the pitch

Sinking ship: Pereira entered the fray with United already behind and could not turn around his side's fortunes

Patrick McNair

Age: 19

Position: Centre-back/midfielder

Profile: McNair arrived at United in 2011 as a midfielder but quickly adapted to being able to competently play at centre-back as well.

The Northern Irishman himself does not believe he will know his own best position for a couple of years due to his own versatility.

He is highly rated and is not afraid to put his foot in - he is not immune to a booking - and would give Van Gaal some much-needed bite in midfield, something United seriously lack right now.

How did he play? Made the bench but did not get on to the pitch.
