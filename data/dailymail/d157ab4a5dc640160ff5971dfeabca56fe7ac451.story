The family of a baby mauled by a fox in their home have been targeted by ‘vile’ internet trolls who blame them for what happened.

Hayley Cawley, 28, walked into her living room to find it ‘covered in blood’ and a fox dragging five-week-old Denny towards the front door.

She managed to wrestle her baby out of the animal’s mouth, but his finger was torn off in the attack on February 6.

Denny had a five-hour operation to 
have his finger reattached and yesterday he joined his parents for their
first TV appearance since it happened.

Miss Cawley and Denny’s father Paul 
Dolan, 27, spoke of their distress over Twitter comments which described
them as ‘stupid’ for leaving their front door ajar. Another claimed 
they had fabricated the story and that a dog must have attacked their 
son.

Mother-of-three Miss Cawley said: 
‘They’ve been terrible. I had a little look last night [on Twitter]. I 
did have a little look and then I had to close the page down because I 
just thought, “Oh my God”. Saying about me having a dog and stuff – I’ve
never had a dog in my life.’

Lorraine Kelly, who interviewed the 
family on ITV’s Daybreak, condemned the ‘vile’ trolls, saying: ‘It’s 
absolutely disgusting. ‘How dare they attack you and your family. It is 
bad enough that you are trying to get over this terrible ordeal without 
coping with that too.’

During the interview, Mr Dolan cradled Denny, who bore scars on his face and head and had a large bandage around his left hand.

Looking shaken, Miss Cawley, of Bromley, South-East London, admitted she was ‘not dealing 
with it too well’ and said the attack was ‘the worst nightmare I have ever experienced in my life’.

Since the incident, the couple have 
called for more fox culling, saying, ‘if a dog had done this, it would 
have been destroyed’.

Some Twitter users were unsympathetic with the parents, however.

User Diane wrote: ‘A fox cull?! No! 
Stupid parents not closing doors and windows or leaving child 
unattended. People need to be careful with their food waste!’

Another said they hoped the RSPCA 
would visit the family ‘to explain it was their fault for scaring foxy’.
Stuart Wood wrote: ‘If you own a dog and that dog attacked your baby in
some way but you didn’t want to report that, just tell the media a 
killer fox broke in.’

Mr Dolan left the family home last week to pick up Miss Cawley’s two other children from school.

But the door had recently been 
‘serviced’, meaning the catch was apparently looser than usual and did 
not shut properly. He later received a phone call from his partner 
saying, ‘a fox has attacked the baby, he’s bleeding everywhere’.

Miss Cawley recalled how she had gone
upstairs to ‘tidy up’ when she heard Denny crying. She ran downstairs 
to the living room, where she saw him being dragged towards the front 
door. She hit and kicked the fox, but feared this was making it ‘sink 
its teeth in even further’.

She told a newspaper: ‘I got hold of 
Denny’s wrist and tore it out of the fox’s mouth. I had no other choice.
Its teeth were showing and it was making this awful noise, hissing and 
growling.

‘I bent down and picked the baby up and it all went quiet. I remember looking at the fox and shutting the door calmly.’

The family have since moved out of 
their home into temporary accommodation. Miss Cawley said: ‘I’d never go
back there. As soon as it happened I just said I’m not going back 
there. I could never relive that every day.’
