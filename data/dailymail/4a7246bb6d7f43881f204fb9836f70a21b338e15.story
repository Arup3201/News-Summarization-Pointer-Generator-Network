An award-winning British cheese-maker which produces cheddar for Prince Charles’s Duchy Originals label has been forced out of business – with the blame put on supermarkets.

Denhay Farms has produced its famous West Country farmhouse cheddar for more than 50 years.

For the past four years it has sold to supermarkets, including Waitrose, Tesco and Morrisons, but the family business is now making its last wheel of cheddar after being ‘unable to secure a commercially viable price across all sectors of the market’.

Out of business: Denhay Farms will stop making its farmhouse cheddar after half a century

George Streatfield, who with wife Amanda took over Denhay in 1977 from his father, a co-founder of the business in Bridport, Dorset, said the decision to close was ‘heartbreaking’.

Cheddar, he said, had become extremely competitive and being forced  to reduce costs and margins by buyers while production costs were rising had made it impossible for the business to continue.

Denhay, which has won more than 100 awards, had been sold in Waitrose under the Royal seal of Duchy Originals since 2009.

It will also cease production of its traditional farmhouse whey butter, but will continue to sell milk and organic bacon, which was awarded the Royal warrant by Prince Charles in 2011.

Independent cheese-maker Mary Quicke said: ‘Cheese-makers who supply to supermarkets aren’t making  any money.’

Waitrose, which recently featured Denhay cheese in an advertisement with celebrity chef Heston Blumenthal, said: ‘Waitrose always pays a fair return to our suppliers, and we have a long history of supporting small and artisan food companies.’
