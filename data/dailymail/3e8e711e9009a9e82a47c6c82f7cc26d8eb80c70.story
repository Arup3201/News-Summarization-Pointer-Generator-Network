Supermarkets, football clubs, airports and major utilities companies are still using costly 08 numbers two months after they were banned.

Fair Telecoms Campaign has named and shamed hundreds of companies dragging their feet over the new rules, including National Rail, Heathrow Airport, Lidl and Tottenham Hotspur.

New regulations came into force on June 13 this year, prohibiting use of numbers not charged at the 'basic rate' for contact from consumers.

Fair Telecoms Campaign has named and shamed hundreds of companies  still using costly 08 numbers

Calls to all numbers beginning 07, 08 and 09 are not charged at the 'basic rate', as special charges are imposed, so companies have been told to offer 01, 02 or 03 numbers.

Dave Hickson from the Fair Telecoms Campaign said: 'We want to get rid of these numbers once and for all.'

Consumer watchdog Which? said that people should not be expected to pay a premium to ask a question or complain.

Executive Director Richard Lloyd said: 'If they haven't already all companies and public bodies should now do the right thing by consumers and drop high rate numbers without delay.' 

The 084 and 087 lines can cost up to 15p a minute from a landline and 41p from mobile phones.

Most leading firms including Sky and Morrisons have switched to basic rate 03 numbers, which are normally included in phone users' monthly calls allowance. 

Any company which fails to comply with the new law and still offers a premium-rate number for their customer service line will be putting themselves at risk of court action.

Customers will be within their rights to take such companies to court and successfully reclaim the excessive charges made to them. 

Trading Standards are also able to get involved in bringing companies to justice.

A Gatwick spokesman said: 'Gatwick Airport does not charge the premium rate from its side when customers call our main customer contact number. To this end, we will be adding a voicemail up-front so passengers are aware that they will only be charged the basic rate from a landline.'

A Tottenham Hotspur FC spokesman said: 'All of our phone lines tariffs are in line with the new legal requirements, with the charges for our 0844 numbers being dependent on the callers 'personal call plan with their Telecoms or mobile supplier and up to a maximum of 10 pence per minute from a landline.

'We are in the process of implementing 03 numbers in order to provide further clarity for callers.' 

British Airways (0844) - Between 1p and 13p per min for a landline and 5p to 41p for a mobile. 

National Rail (0845) - Between 1p and 12p per min for a landline and 5p to 41p for a mobile.  

South West Water (0844) - Calls from BT landlines are charged at 3 pence per minute.

Heathrow Airport (0844) - Between 1p and 13p per min for a landline and 5p to 41p for a mobile.

Gatwick Airport (0844) -  Between 1p and 13p per min for a landline and 5p to 41p for a mobile. 

Tottenham Hotspur (0844) - Between 1p and 13p per min for landline and 5p to 41p for mobile. 

Lidl (0870) - Between 1p and 12p per minute for landline and 5p to 4p for a mobile.
