Resplendent in a revealing black corset, a pair of fishnet tights and a racy pair of thigh-high boots, the red carpet at last night's Grammys provided Madonna  with the opportunity for yet another headline-grabbing stunt.

Never one to shy away from flashing the flesh, the mother-of-four turned and cheekily hoisted her Givenchy skirt for the benefit of waiting photographers before sashaying off.

Once inside Los Angeles' Staples Centre, the 56-year-old began posting snaps on her Instagram page, posing happily with Jay-Z and rapper Nas before sharing a risqué shot of her cleavage.

Risque: Madonna picked a typically revealing ensemble for her appearance at last night's Grammys

Like Miley Cyrus, Rihanna and Katy Perry, Madonna is a past master at generating publicity but, unlike the twenty-something starlets, at 56, the Queen of Pop is a middle-aged industry veteran with a career that stretches back to the 1980s.

She is also a mother of four, with an eldest child, Lourdes, now 18, who has just begun studying music, theatre and dance at the University of Michigan.

Son Rocco, from her second marriage to British film director Guy Ritchie, is now 14 and no stranger to controversy himself, having caused a storm in October when he posted a video purporting to show IS terrorists executing children on his Instagram page.

His mother, in typically bombastic fashion, hit back at critics, telling the world that she was 'proud' of the teenager who was, she added, 'fighting for freedom'.

Such antics, while unsurprising in a teenager, have also become a feature of Madonna's own forays into social media, along with scores of racy photos.

Typical: Aged 56, Madonna has no intention of hanging up her corsets and fishnets just yet

Cheeky: Madonna took the opportunity to generate a few headlines with a bottom-flash for the paps

The latter proved the source of the most recent Twitter storm to engulf her, after she caused fury by posting pictures of iconic public figures such as Martin Luther King and Nelson Mandela with bondage tape photoshopped onto their faces.

In the ensuing furore, she was accused of both racism and narcissism - both of which she took to social media to deny.

'I'm sorry. I'm not comparing my self to anyone. I'm admiring and acknowledging there Rebel Hearts (sic)'.

She added: 'This is niether a crime or an insult or racist! I also did it with Michael jaclson and frida khalo and marilyn monroe (sic).'

'Am I saying I am them NO I'm saying they are Rebel Hearts too. And I didn't do it My fans did And I just re posted those photos My fans aren't racist either If they put me in the same category as these other people Thank you.'

Racy: The 56-year-old star posted this cleavage-baring snap from inside the Staples Centre

Established: Unlike Miley Cyrus and co, Madonna, pictured with Jay-Z (l) and Nas (r), doesn't need publicity

'I'm very flattered and I hope one day to live up to 1 100th of what those people accomplished.'

But while Madonna's forays into social media are sometimes ill-advised, when it comes to her wardrobe, the 56-year-old remains as outrageous as she was in the 80s.

The video for her most recent single, Rebel Heart, saw her gyrating in the midst of a group of horned dancers wearing the skimpiest of sequinned corsets.

Last week, she was spotted shopping in New York wearing yet another corset, this time a sheer black lacy number that left little to the imagination.

Just before Christmas, the 56-year-old went even further and posed topless for Interview magazine,  trussed up in a front-less bra and yet another corset.

Ironically, the shoot was unveiled shortly after she criticised Kim Kardashian for doing the same thing, a week earlier, in Paper magazine.

Posting yet another topless photo of herself on Instagram, she added: 'Its confusing. Nipples are considered forbidden and provocative but exposing your ass is not. #flummoxed (sic).'

All very Miley Cyrus, the twenty-something popstar who has made her name by twerking enthusiastically in a variety of revealing outfits, while sharing her (often) controversial views with her followers on Twitter.

Controversial: She recently caused a Twitter storm after posting a photo of Princess Diana in bondage tape

But Madonna is no twenty-something, however much she might like to be, and in David Banda, nine, and Mercy James, eight, has two very young children at home.

Their lives have been shared with a succession of boyfriends, few of whom have lasted more than a year or two, and all of whom have been considerably younger.

Just before her 56th birthday last August, Madonna split with the latest - 26-year-old Timor Steffens who had, rather unromantically, likened her to his mother.

The eight-month fling with Steffens followed a three-year relationship with another backing dancer, 26-year-old Brahim Zaibat.

Zaibat, like Madonna's most famous ex, Guy Ritchie, was slammed by the singer on one of the tracks on her latest album.

In the song, entitled Unapologetic B***h, she allows herself a chuckle at the dancer's sexual prowess as well as mocking his lack of wealth.

Controversial: Madonna with Miley Cyrus, who has managed to pull off several controversies of her own

Quirky: She has always had an eclectic approach to getting dressed and has no intention of toning it down

Scanty: For her on stage appearance at the Grammys, Madonna chose yet another revealing outfit

Inspiration: The short red number was seemingly inspired by Spanish matadors

The song contains the lyrics: 'I know you'd like it if I stayed home and cried. But that ain't gonna happen, here's the reason why: When we did it, I'll admit it, wasn't satisfied.

Another line boasted: 'I'm popping bottles that you can't even afford. I'm throwing parties and you won't get in the door.'

The track has a reggae-themed chorus, which Madonna ends with an expletive-filled rant against her former lover, with the line: 'You know you never really know how much your bulls**t cost me, but f**k you.'

So will the Queen of Pop ever change? Based on  recent comments about being obsessed with death and wanting to live in the moment, it would seem unlikely.

'I became very obsessed with death,' she confided in the December issue of Interview Magazine, 'and the idea that you never know when death will arrive.

'So one has to do as much as possible all the time to get the most out of life.'

And, whether it means never-ending corsets, regular social media spats or hordes of toy boys, Madonna is certainly doing that.

From the moment she burst onto the scene in 1985's Desperately Seeking Susan, Madonna has never been afraid to raise eye-brows with a raunchy outfit.

Here are some of the most memorable: 

First look: Madonna debuted her love of short and sweet ensembles in 1985's Desperately Seeking Susan

Enter the corset: Madonna, seen performing in Leeds during her 1987 Who's That Girl tour, loves a corset

Iconic: Her Jean Paul Gaultier corset, created for the 1990 Blonde Ambition tour, has become iconic

Naughty: Madonna's love of a skimpy outfit was well established as her 1993 Girlie Show tour got underway

Spot the difference! Madonna's red carpet style, seen here in 2013 (left) and 1991 (right), is little changed

Skimpy: Stage outfits, including those from the 2008 Sticky and Sweet tour, remain as racy as ever

Favourite: As with each of her tours, the publicity pictures for Sticky and Sweet saw Madonna don a corset

Raunchy: In 2009, Madonna branched out, teaming her thigh-high boots with a see-through shirt instead

Shocking: In 2012, Madonna, back in her corset, shocked when she was seen swigging bourbon on stage

Old favourite: Last night's Givenchy get-up was typical of Madonna, as were the fishnets and boots
