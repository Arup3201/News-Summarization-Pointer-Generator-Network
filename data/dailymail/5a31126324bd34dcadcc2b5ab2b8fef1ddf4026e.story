It’s a slice of fantasyland for the four-legged set and it’s been paid for by cash-strapped Uncle Sam.

TriBeCa, one of Manhattan’s most affluent neighborhoods put a federal windfall worth millions into play this past summer. 

Local brass decided to spend the $5million earmarked in 2005 not on subways or bridges but to bankroll a dog run and install an immaculate landscaping along a waterfront park, MailOnline has learned.

And last night the same group who plunked down the millions of dollars worth of sod and cement feted a star-studded gala to raise $2million in hopes to fund the Hudson River Park because they claim it ‘does not have a continuous allocation of city, state or federal funds.’

The entire pricey project cost $4.8million to groom the grounds in between Piers 25 and 26.

The swath of park snakes for five miles along the Hudson River’s edge and includes manicured lawns, dotted with planters and meticulous landscaping befitting its boldface natives including: Hugh Jackman, Jennifer Connelly and husband Paul Bettany who are dog owners, as well as Gwyneth Paltrow, Robert DeNiro, Jay Z and Beyonce, Russell Simmons, Jenna Bush, Amanda Peet and husband David Benioff, and Leonardo DiCaprio amongst others.

Luminaries like Mayor Mike Bloomberg and Brooke Shields lent their support to help raise funds for the Hudson River Park trust Thursday night.

Of the millions that were spent to spruce-up the Hudson River Park, $642,000 was dumped on the yin-yang shaped Tribeca Dog Run.

The decadent dog oasis allows puppies (K-9s that are 23 pounds or less) to frolic free from bigger dogs who have their own set of bricks to do their business.

Demand has risen for dog roaming space because of the neighborhood's dog boom, says one longtime local. 

‘There’s over 400 dogs in just one building—they’re dog crazy around here,’ a source told MailOnline.

Stewards from the Hudson River Park Trust (HRPT), the state and city partnership chaired by third-term Mayor Mike Bloomberg’s girlfriend Diana L. Taylor, unveiled the dog run to the public this summer after successfully winning over New York Congressman Jerrold Nadler to shake D.C.’s moribund money trees.

Congressman Nadler managed to procure the millions in federal funds to bankroll the spanking 5,000 square-foot stretch of grey-blue esplanade; taking pride in the amenities including: scaled down cabana umbrellas and even paw-activated fresh water fountains.

Asked about the multi-million dollar dog park’s price tag paid for by the nation’s taxpayers Congressman Nadler’s office reverted back to a statement from August 5 when wagging tails (dogs and pols alike) triumphed during a ribbon cutting ceremony before mugs and snouts were photographed.

‘I am proud to have been able to bring over $4 million dollars in federal funds to the continued expansion of this park, which has become an invaluable resource to New Yorkers and visitors alike," said Congressman Jerry Nadler in a statement.

'The addition of the new dog run and recreational space on Pier 25 adds another layer to the many amenities Hudson River Park provides to the surrounding neighbourhoods. I am thrilled to join HRPT and the community in celebrating this new section of the park.'

A day later, in a surprising about-face congressman’s camp told MailOnline that the monies for the park’s revamp were actually not federal. 

‘No federal funds were used to construct the dog run.’

The congressman’s aide pointed to the 2005 bill where $5.6million dollars appropriated for ‘a pedestrian walkway along Route 9A in Hudson River Park, NY.’

Nadler's office offered no specifics on how those millions were spent.

Federal money is often line-itemed to maintain beautification standards along the country’s scenic highways.

Still, at a September 26 meeting Madelyn Wils, the Trust’s president and CEO stood at a lectern before her peers and thanked Congressman Nadler for the federal cash and rejoiced in the dog run’s birth; the fourth dog run in the area.

Wils lauded the landscaping of the 30,000 square feet of urban utopia and doted on the pristine grounds first ‘christened’ by none other than the Mayor Bloomberg’s yellow labradors Bonnie and Clyde.

‘Congressman Nadler appropriation of $4.8 million transportation funding made this opening possible.’

But Wils also couldn’t explain how federal transportation funds were allocated to construct the sultan dog digs and passed the buck to Congressman Nadler.

‘One might wonder why federal transportation dollars were being used to open a dog run,’ she said to an orchestra of laughs.

‘But maybe [Nadler] can explain it.’

More canned laughs filled the New York City’s Planning Commission hearing room.

In lieu of this week’s federal government shutdown, few would feign to laugh now.

Last night’s gala, co-chaired by Juliane Moore was hosted by actor Hugh Jackman (his wife's on the Gala Committee) and featured comedian Denis Leary.

The list of notables also welcomed Hollywood staples such as Gala Committee members Brooke Shields, Martha Stewart, Edie Falco and Goldman Sachs partner Paula Madoff.

Kerri Lyon, of The Hudson River Park Trust called the outdoor addition ‘an amazing gem along the Hudson River’ and stressed that the pricey dog run and landscaping were only part of a much larger project that also includes a restaurant. 

She defended Thursday's glitzy gala to raise funds for the trust that honored none other than Goldman Sachs.

She said cash is in short supply to keep the park self-sustaining.

‘Hudson River Park does not have a continuous allocation of city, state or federal funds,’ she said. ‘It was designed to be self-sustaining so that the park is responsible for raising the funds (from a variety of public and private sources) required to operate and maintain itself.’

According to the Parks Department there are approximately 60 dog runs throughout the five boroughs and their price tags and upkeep vary. 

An average New York City dog run goes for around $375,000-while some navigating around waterlines can surge to $600,000.

Like Tribeca’s K-9 kingdom, a dog run in Juniper Valley Park in Queens was built for $600,000.

Steven E. Greer, the founder of BatteryPark.TV and 13 year resident of the area isn’t laughing and called the dog run and its surrounding upgraded parkland a disaster.

‘Give me a backhoe, concrete, and $20,000, and I can make a dog run. For $50,000, professional contractors can make one for a private company.’

While Greer acknowledged that government contracts often are ‘inflated many-fold’ this particular  park expansion and pampering for well-to-do pooches is beyond redemption.

‘Five million dollars is astronomical, egregious, even by government standards.’

Vincent D’Accolti, 25, who runs WeBuildLI.com and has begun installing dog runs on Long Island in addition to his home improvement offerings.

He said the cost of a six-figure dog park was hard to imagine. 

‘I thought a $15,000 dog run was elaborate.'

Ultimately, D’Accolti says the rich or run-of-the-mill dog run need only accomplish the same call of duty. 

‘When I think of a dog run it’s a place where a dog can piss and s---.’
