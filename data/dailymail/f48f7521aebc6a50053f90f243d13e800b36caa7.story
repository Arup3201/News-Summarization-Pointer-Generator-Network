A city in Ohio is battling a plague of crows with swarms estimated to be 60,000-strong - meaning there's almost one bird to every human inhabitant.

Residents, business owners and police in Springfield have joined together in a bid to get rid of the 'dirty' birds, which leave droppings everywhere and create noise pollution.

Volunteer armies have been brandishing lasers at the buildings from dusk until early night, while a biologist also recommended using sound machines.

At war: That means there's almost one bird to every human inhabitant in the town of Springfield 

However, the digital repellents which send out sounds to scare off the birds, have largely been unsuccessful. 

'The crows adapted quickly and realized that’s just a fake,' Roger Sherrock, CEO of the Clark County Heritage Center and one of the leaders in the fight against the crows, told the Springfield News Sun.

Trouble-makers: The birds' overwhelming presence on trees and buildings is causing concern about damage and potential health hazards from their waste

Some have compared the crow-laden landscape to the Alfred Hitchcock movie The Birds, where the California town of Bodega Bay suddenly becomes the subject of unexplained and violent bird attacks.

However, the murder of crows troubling Springfield isn't aggressive like the one in the 1963 thriller.

But with tens of thousands of them at times, their overwhelming presence on trees and buildings is causing concern about damage and potential health hazards from the birds' waste.

Sherrock noted that the stones swallowed by crows to help digest their food have clogged up gutters on buildings and business owners have been paying thousands to get droppings removed.

Springfielders are now in the midst of a two-week drive to banish the crows for good.

The city's service department is employing up to two workers per night during this time to fire flare guns.

They hope this will convince the birds to choose a roosting place away from the downtown area.

Apparently the crow epidemic has been an ongoing problem for more than a decade in the area.

But Sherrock concluded: 'We’ll keep going as long as it takes.'
