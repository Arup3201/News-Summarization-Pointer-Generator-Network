Damilola Taylor’s father demanded a public inquiry yesterday after one of his son’s killers was recalled to jail – only 16 days after being freed.

Ricky Preddie was arrested on Thursday night after entering a South London estate to meet up with fellow gang members, breaching the terms of his release.

It is the second time he has been released then recalled for breaking the conditions of his licence. He is now likely to stay behind bars until his tariff expires in May 2013.

Preddie was originally released in September 2010 but sent back to jail last March for breaking the conditions of his licence

Ten-year-old Damilola bled to death after being stabbed with a broken bottle on a council estate in Peckham, South London, in November 2000, as he walked home from the local library after school. He had moved to Britain from Nigeria only a few months before.

Preddie, now 24, was first released in 2010, four years into an eight-year sentence. Only six months later he was recalled after returning to the Peckham estates he terrorised as a boy in breach of his licence.

On January 25 this year, he was freed a second time. Police were alerted after he was seen in Southwark, where he was thought to be associating with gang members.

Yesterday Damilola’s father Richard said he was planning to write to the Prime Minister calling for an inquiry into how ‘the system has failed so badly in this case’.

He said: ‘I am very angry with the Parole Board for the way they handled this and the way they have ignored my advice.’

Mr Taylor, 64, had previously pleaded with the authorities not to release Ricky Preddie or his brother Danny, both of whom were jailed for eight years for Damilola’s manslaughter in 2006. Danny was released last September.

Mr Taylor has said the pair should be hanged. After Ricky’s second release, he said: ‘He has not served enough time behind bars for what he did.

‘He has not had the opportunity to reflect on what he has done and it is obvious he will return to criminality.’

Gary Trowsdale, managing director of the Damilola Taylor Trust, said: ‘For the second time in 18 months, the boy has been recalled due to breaking the terms of his licence. Neither of these boys has shown any remorse.

‘Every time this happens the Damilola family are being dragged back through all the pain.’

Heartache: Damilola's father Richard, with his late wife Gloria, who died in 2008. Mr Taylor has previously said in an interview he believed his son's killers 'should have been hanged'
