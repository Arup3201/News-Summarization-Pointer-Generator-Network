They are meant to live an austere life of quiet reflection and meditative study.

But this video appears to show Buddhist monks enjoying a very different lifestyle - wearing stylish aviators glasses while listening to wireless headphones on a private jet.

The monks from Thailand are now under investigation following numerous complaints from Buddhists around the world after the two minute and 47 second long clip was posted on Youtube.

The Office of National Buddhism director-general Nopparat Benjawatananun said that the agency saw the video and had warned the monks from a monastery in Thailand's north-east not to repeat the lavish behaviour. It plans to monitor monks nationwide.

With the world's largest Buddhist population, Thailand has attempted to help Buddha's 2,600-year-old doctrine stand the test of time through a variety of means, including imposing a ban on the sale of alcohol on religious holidays.

The efforts, however, are sometimes tainted by the monks themselves.

Last year, about 300 out of 61,416 Buddhist monks and novices in Thailand were reprimanded - in several cases removed from the monkhood - because of their misconduct, ranging from alcohol consumption, having sex with women, to extortion.

The office also received complaints about monks driving cars, and scams and false claims of black magic uses by monks.

Tainted: Approximately 300 of the 61,416 monks in Thailand were reprimanded for misconduct over their behaviour last year

Mr Nopparat said the Buddhist monks in the video were acting 'inappropriately, not composed and not adhering to Buddha's teachings of simplicity and self-restraint'.

Monruedee Bantoengsuk, an administrative officer at Khantitham Temple in Sisaket province, confirmed that the monks on the private plane lived at the temple but refused to give details about the trip.

'We can explain this, but not now,' she said, saying that the abbot, who appeared in the video, is currently on a religious tour in France.

The images from the video contrasted with the abbot's message on the temple's homepage that read: 'The true core of those who preach Buddha's teachings is to not to own any objects at all.

Keeping it simple: Khantitham Temple in Sisaket province says on its website that while monks need to keep abreast of what is going on in the world, they need to use the appropriate tools, and do not require luxuries

'When Lord Buddha was alive, there wasn't anything like this. There were no cars, smart phones or cameras, so the rules were much simpler,' said Mr Nopparat.

'While the monks need to keep themselves abreast of new knowledge, current events and technology, they are restrained to choose the appropriate tools.'

He said one way to prevent the monks from misbehaving is for followers not to spoil them with valuable objects or vices.

'In many cases, it was the followers who gave the monks the luxury. Some bought them sports cars. This is by no means necessary.'
