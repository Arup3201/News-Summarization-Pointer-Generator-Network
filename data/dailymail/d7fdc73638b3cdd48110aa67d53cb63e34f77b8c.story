Amanda Knox can no longer rely on Raffaele Sollecito being her alibi in the Meredith Kercher murder case, with Sollecito now denying she was with him the whole of the night on which the British student was brutally murdered.

This change in his defence could potentially incriminate Knox.

Sollecito and Knox were originally sentenced to 25 and 28 years in prison, respectively, for the murder of Kercher in Perugia and served four years before being released in 2011.

Change of defense: Sollecito now denies that Amanda Knox was with him for the entire night on which Meredith Kercher was murdered in 2007

Mismatching points of view: It is not the first time Sollecito has expressed doubts about the holes in Knox’s story

On January 30, an Italian appeals court reconvicted the pair of murdering former roommate Kercher - a ruling the pair are again appealing.

Knox and Sollecito have always maintained that they were together the evening of the brutal 2007 murder in Perugia, after which Miss Kercher, 21, was found half naked her throat slit in the cottage she shared with Knox.

But Sollecito's lawyer Giulia Bongiorno said that 'for the entire first part of the evening, they were not together. It’s this first part of the evening that’s new [to his defence]'.

Sollecito has pointed to phone records that show that Knox was away from his house for part of the evening.

In a dramatic change of legal tactics that he announced in a press conference in Rome he has now claimed there are ‘anomalies’ in Knox’s story.

Determined: Knox, a University of Washington student, has been in the United States since 2011 and has vowed  the she would never 'willingly' return to Italy to face her fate in court

Brutal: Meredith Kercher was stabbed to death in 2007

Knox says that she received a text, while at Sollecito’s house, from her boss, telling her not to come to her job at a nightclub that night.

But phone records show that the text was received on the road between their houses, something that their retrial judges felt was key in their reconstruction of events. Sollecito's phone and computer records show that he was at home that evening.

Sollecito said: ‘I have always believed in the innocence of Amanda. But I have to react to the accusations of the court and to the text message.

‘Either the court has made their umpteenth mistake or she lied to me.’

He added: ‘I was in love with her and we had some very happy moments, but ultimately Amanda was a stranger.'

'There are anomalies in her version of events. Against me there is nothing.'

The 'fundamental basis' for the conviction is Knox’s memo to police in which she says she was at the cottage when the murder took place, he said.

‘I believe this was a hallucination, but if the court believes it is true then they have to accept that she did not say I was there. She gave me an alibi. ‘

It is not the first time Sollecito has expressed his doubts about the holes in Knox’s story.

In an interview with Italian television earlier this year, he said Knox had spent the night with him but went back to her place to shower, he said. When she returned, she was 'very agitated,' he said.

She told him that it looked like someone had broken in and that there was blood in the bathroom, Sollecito said. But rather than call the police, she showered and returned to his place something he finds odd. ‘Certainly I asked her questions,' he said. 'Why did you take a shower? Why did she spend so much time there?'

He didn't get any real answers from her, he said.

Knox, a University of Washington student, has been in the United States since 2011. She left Italy right after an earlier appeals court ruling overturned the initial lower court conviction that had led to her imprisonment in Italy. The American, 28, has vowed the she would never 'willingly' return to Italy to face her fate in court.

She has said she is hopeful Italian courts will 'once again recognize' her innocence.
