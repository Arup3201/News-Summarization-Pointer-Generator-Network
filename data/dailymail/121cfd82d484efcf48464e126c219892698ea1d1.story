Mohammad Al-Sharif, a 22-year-old Saudi Arabian student, was banned from driving after he admitted driving his father's supercar after smoking cannabis

A 22-year-old Saudi student was caught driving through Hyde Park in his father's custom made McLaren supercar, after he had been smoking cannabis in the early hours. 

Mohammad Al-Sharif was stopped by police as he drove through the London park and confessed to having taken drugs at 7.30am that morning, when officers found he was unsteady on his feet and slurring his words.

The 22-year-old had been driving his father's limited edition McLaren car, which is worth around £168,500. 

The supercar, which goes from 0mph to 60mph in 2.8 seconds had been given a makeover to make it even more powerful. 

It was also a previous winner of 'best supercar' in the Middle East's Car of the Year awards.

Business student Al-Sharif, who lives off a family allowance, admitted driving while in unfit through drugs and was fined £400. 

He was also disqualified from driving for a year.

Hammersmith Magistrates' Court heard that he was stopped at about 10.40am on December 11 last year because he was seen driving 'erratically.'

Mr Gill said: 'He was spoken to and there was a strong smell of cannabis coming from the car, he was the sole occupier. 

'He was unsteady on his feet, his speech was slurred when he spoke and he appeared intoxicated.

'He was asked if he had been smoking cannabis and said he had at 7.30 that morning.

'He was arrested and taken to Paddington Green Police Station and searched and a small amount of cannabis was found that he admitted was his.' 

A blood test found Al-Sharif had used cannabis and another drug, which is believed to have been prescription drugs.  

He was found to be driving on a Saudi Arabia-issued International Driving Licence, which ironically was not valid in his home country.

Al-Sharif had been driving the supercar, which had been modified to make it even more powerful 

Al-Sharif admitted having taken cannabis when he was stopped by police who spotted his 'erratic driving' 

The car, which belongs to his father, had been extensively modified to make it even more powerful. 

Al-Sharif denied the claim his driving was 'erratic', the court heard. 

He had been studying in London since 2012, attending Birkbeck College, the London School of Business and Finance to improve his English and career prospects in the finance sector.

He has no income and survives with the financial support from his family in Saudi Arabia.  

Al-Sharif was spotted driving a McLaren MP4-12c 3.8 litre twin-turbo V8 Velocita Wind Edition. 

In the Middle East’s Car of the Year awards the vehicle won ‘Best Supercar’ and overall ‘Car of the Year’ for 2012.

The car was priced at £168,500 when launched onto the market in 2011.

The Velocita Wind Edition was inspired by a mystery Saudi enthusiast, who demanded an alternative custom design to the McLaren MP4-12c. 

It can reach 60mph in just 2.8 seconds.  

Modifications included increasing the output from 592 hp and 442 lb/ft of torque to 660 hp and 502 lb/ft.

It also includes a new spoiler lip for the front bumper and an added rear wing. 

The McLaren MP4-12C has a 592 hp and can reach speeds of 60mph in just under 3 seconds. It has seven gears.  

The McLaren Velocita Wind Edition is a modified and more powerful version of the McLaren MP4-12c
