He chose to step down from hosting Strictly Come Dancing after accepting the ‘rigours’ of working on live television had become too much for him – but declined to elaborate on what they were.

Now the director of the popular Saturday night show has revealed what Sir Bruce Forsyth was reluctant to divulge.

Nikki Parsons said that his refusal to wear an earpiece – as well as his failing eyesight – made the veteran host a ‘challenge’ to work with and resulted in the autocue getting bigger and closer during each series.

Sir Bruce, 86, announced his decision to quit Strictly in April after ten years of presenting the show issuing a statement in which he said: ‘After ten wonderful years and 11 series, I believe that it is now the right time to step down from the rigours of presenting the Strictly live shows.’

He confirmed he would only continue with presenting the show’s specials and in recent weeks said he feared going off like ‘stale fruit’ if he remained in the post much longer.

Now Miss Parsons has admitted that it was becoming a struggle for Sir Bruce to keep up with the weekly filming schedule.

Speaking at a Bafta Craft Masterclass on Monday night, she said: ‘‘He’s brilliant Bruce, he’s a legend, it’s just that he comes with various things he won’t do which don’t help in the live show.

‘It would be great to be able to say in his ear that something’s happened and give him directions but it’s just a bit like OK Bruce, off you go. And to be honest he’s such a people person that if anything does go wrong you’re in safe hands, because he can make a drama and a comedy out of anything.

'But it is a challenge. And the autocue font has been getting bigger and bigger and getting closer and closer.’

Tess Daly, 45, and Claudia Winkleman, 42, will now co-host the series when it returns this autumn.

Also speaking at the event was costume designer Vicky Gill, who revealed the surprising secret to making sure everything stays tucked in during energetic dances – she sews a pair of Speedos onto the base hems of shirts.

And professional dancer Brendan Cole spoke about his own fears that his days on Strictly might be numbered.

As one of only two professionals to have been in the show since it started in 2004, Cole, 38, has partnered celebrities including Lulu, Olympic cyclist Victoria Pendleton and singer Sophie Ellis-Bextor.

But his only win was the very first series with ITV newsreader Natasha Kaplinsky.

Revealing his concerns, Cole said: ‘We never know before May or June which I think is particularly rude, because actually you can’t plot your end of the year, which you block out for Strictly, and chances are the phone’s gonna ring and they’ll say “Well actually, we’re not gonna use you this series” and you go “Well thanks very much, how am I gonna pay my mortgage?”

‘So there’s that kind of dilemma. But I guess as long as you keep getting better, and bringing new thinks to the table… but they’ve got to keep things fresh. People will come and go, one day it’ll be me and it will be very sad, Strictly is a part of my life.’

A BBC spokesman commented: ‘Strictly director Nikki Parsons has had a great working relationship with Sir Bruce Forsyth for eight years, and she regards him as the ultimate professional.

'The question posed at Bafta regarding his refusal to wear an earpiece is misleading as Bruce isn’t required to wear an earpiece because, as Nikki said, with Bruce you’re in safe hands.’
