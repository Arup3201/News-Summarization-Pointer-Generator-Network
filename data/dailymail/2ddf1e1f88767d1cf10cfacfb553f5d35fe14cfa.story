Superstar rapper Iggy Azalea is calling for the Papa John's delivery guy who dished out her phone number to be named and shamed.

The angry singer has said she 'wants answers' from the firm and claims they are not taking her complaint seriously.

As she continues to reject Papa John's apology, the Australian rapper has demanded to know the identity of the delivery guy behind the 'illegal'  'data breach.'  

She took to Twitter again to express her frustration at the firm, which she branded 'unprofessional,' in a series of messages to her followers. 

The 24-year-old tweeted: 'I want answers @papajohns why is customer confidentiality a joke to your company?' 

Papa John's has refused to reveal the identity of the driver, but has said that disciplinary action has been taken.

In her latest string of tweets the singer said the company would have retained her name, address, phone number and credit card details .

She told her 4.22million followers: 'A lot of damage can be done if that falls into the wrong hands, we give them this information with the expectation it remains confidential.

'When an employee steals information it's called data breach. It's illegal. There are steps a corporation is supposed to follow afterward.

'They don't include tweeting out song lyrics to the customer making the complaint, it's really unprofessional. I want a real answer.'

The row started after the singer, who attended the Grammys on Sunday in LA, tweeted shortly before the awards ceremony: '@PapaJohns was my favorite pizza but the drivers they use give out your personal phone number to their family members.' 

Papa John's swiftly responded to Iggy's complaint with the message: '@iggyazalea #We should have known better. Customer and employee privacy is important to us. Please don't #bounce us.'

Iggy then shared the text messages that she was receiving from strangers after a Papa John's delivery guy gave out her number

The singer then shared with her 4,2million Twitter followers a text message she had been sent from a random stranger.

'Hello is this iggy azalea my brother had delivered something from Papa John's to u and he gave me the number on Friday night i am ur number one fan  call me back please,' it read.

A follow-up message said: ''Is this u please answer u r my idol.' 

The singer refused to let go of the invasion of her privacy and tweeted: 'And the supervisors at @PapaJohns refuse to send pictures of their employess [sic] so you can identify who it is that steals your information.'

She added: 'You know, to protect their privacy... Too bad they don't value the privacy of their customers also. #DamnShame.' 

Rival pizza company DiGiorno's was quick to jump on the Papa John's PR disaster by tweeting at Iggy: '@IGGYAZALEA delivery. smh'

She replied: '@DiGiornoPizza I know right!' 

A Papa John’s spokesperson told Daily Mail Online: 'Privacy of our customers and employees is extremely important to us. Papa John's has taken appropriate disciplinary action with regard to the employee involved. We are reaching out directly to Ms. Azalea and hope to resolve this incident and make it right.' 

It was unclear whether the employee had been fired.  

Iggy, 24, attended the Grammys on Sunday night at the Staples Center in Los Angeles. 

The Fancy and Bounce hitmaker missed out on an award in the categories she was nominated in - Record of the Year, Best New Artist, Best Pop Duo/Group and Best Rap Album.

But she never got round to sharing her acceptance speech with the audience as she was snubbed for all four awards after losing to Eminem, Sam Smith - twice - and Christina Aguilera.

Iggy Azalea's hair aside... the rapper looked smoking at the Grammy awards in Los Angeles.

Her figure is the definition of hourglass and this gown by Giorgio Armani is truly making the most of her tiny waist and famous curves. And what a stunning shade of blue. It's always a nice change when the red carpet isn't overrun with boring black and Iggy really stands out in this vibrant color.

And while it's a full length look that sweeps the floor, it retains a super sexy edge with its plunging neckline and racy cut outs at the shoulders and rib cage. And the good news for those who fancy recreating Iggy's style in the real world is that there are plenty of dresses, both mini and maxi that will give you her look for less.
