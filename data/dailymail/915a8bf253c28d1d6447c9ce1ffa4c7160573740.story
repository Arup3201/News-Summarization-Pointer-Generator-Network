It's just two-by-two metres, has no windows or power and is made of weatherboard, but it'll still cost you $100,000.

Bathing Box 34, at Shire Hall Beach in Mornington, Victoria does however come painted in the Australian flag, so it's the perfect purchase for the national day on Monday.

While it might be simple, estate agent Geoff Luff told Daily Mail Australia that hadn't stopped 20 potential buyers making inquiries and inspecting it.

'It's just a bare box with a regular stud wall and weatherboard that has got some stuff on the side for storing beach equipment,' Mr Luff said.

'It has been on the market now for about six months and it has had some interest this summer.

'There have probably been about 20 inquiries from people who have had a look, but they're mostly looking for something bigger.'

Mr Luff said there were similar boxes scattered across the peninsula from St Kilda in Melbourne's south-east to the wealthy suburb of Portsea, and that Bathing Box 34 was by no means one of the more pricey options.

'We've got another one at Shire Hall Beach for $155,000 and there are some down in Mount Martha for $250,000,' he said.

'We've got another one at Shire Hall Beach for $155,000 and there are some down in Mount Martha for $250,000,' he said, adding that: 'they're very, very popular'

'Some have power, some people have fridges in there, some people sleep there overnight or store their barbeques in there.

'A lot of them have a 99-year lease and a lot of them were handed down through the family; they're very, very popular.'

Bathing boxes were originally simple structures built to house swimmers and beach equipment in Victoria, but over the decades they've become one of the nation's iconic structures. 

The current owners of the $100,000 box, painted it during Christmas last year and Mr Luff admitted that there had been numerous photos of it taken by passer-bys ever since.

'They've had it for a while and they did it up about two years ago,' he said of its current owners.

'But they don't get as much use for it anymore because their children are a bit older. It has been a good investment for them.'
