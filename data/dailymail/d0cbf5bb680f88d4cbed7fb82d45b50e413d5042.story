Robert Durst's wife has not spoken to him since explosive documentary, The Jinx, aired and is now living with his lawyer, it has been revealed. 

In the aftermath of the   documentary, which outlined the life of real estate scion Robert Durst and his possible involvement in multiple murders, many wished to know more about his wife of 15 years, Debrah Lee Charatan.

Charatan, a self-made real estate executive, was briefly featured in the documentary in a clip from years earlier as she gave testimony to police pertaining to the her husband's murder of Morris Black in Galveston, Texas, but other than that did not participate in the film.

Now it has been revealed that Charatan not only advised Durst against participating in the documentary, but also has not spoken to him since it premiered and has been living with his lawyer. 

This as the final episode featured audio of Durst possibly admitting to committing these murders, saying he 'killed them all' during a moment when the cameras were off but his microphone was still on.

The New York Times writes that Charatan seems to have taken a step back from her husband recently, no longer travelling with him and living with Steven I. Holm, one of his lawyers.

Charatan and Holm were even photographed together at a Central Park event in 2010, though the extent of their relationship is not known and Charatan refused requests for comment from the paper.

Authorities are now looking to question Charatan as they believe her husband is responsible for murdering his friend Susan Berman on Christmas Eve of 2000, just two weeks after he wed Charatan.

The incident occurred shortly after Berman, a lifelong confidant of Durst, contacted the man to let him know that police wished to speak with her regarding the disappearance of his first wife Kathie in 1982, who to this day has never been found.

Both Durst and Charatan have previously revealed that they were only married so that she could receive his estate and inheritance should he die, and so the money would not go back into the family business.

Durst remained upset that his father Seymour had selected his younger brother Douglas to run the Durst Organization in 1994, and thus did not want the $2million he received every year from a trust to go to the company should he die.

'It was our understanding that unless I was married to him, I couldn’t benefit from any of the trusts,' Charatan said in a deposition while being questioned about the Black incident, in which her husband was ultimately found by a jury to be acting in self defense when he shot the man and then dismembered his body. 

Because of their marriage however, Charatan cannot be compelled to testify against her husband as he faces possible new charges in the death of Berman, and even if she did, Durst would likely have her testimony blocked. 

Charatan, who wed Durst (above in his booking photo following his arrest for the Morris Black murder) in 2000, is said to have advised Durst against doing the recent documentary The Jinx

Meanwhile, reports that Charatan could also face aiding and abetting charges stemming from Durst's recent arrest in New Orleans as authorities believe he was trying to flee the country for Cuba, seem to be unfounded as she not only was not speaking to to him at that time but also was not responsible for sending him the $117,000 in cash that arrived shortly after he was taken into police custody on a warrant from Los Angeles County who wished to extradite him and charge him with murder in the death of Berman.

That money it seems came from another woman in New York, who sent it to Durst in luggage that was also filled with shoes after he called her upon his arrival in New Orleans.

Charatan has never said much about her husband, frequently refusing to comment about the man who she met at a real estate dinner in 1988, and has kept a very low profile in recent weeks as new charges have been brought against him.

In addition to the murder charge in California, he also faces charges in New Orleans as he had a gun and sizable amount of marijuana on him at the time of his arrest.

When Durst was arrested for murdering Black however, Charatan was the first person he called; handling his money, helping him decide what lawyer to hire and frequently flying to Texas for the trial.

And while much has been made of Durst's tragic childhood and his mother's death by suicide when he was just a young boy, Charatan had an equally troubling youth.

Her parents both came from Poland having survived the Nazis, her father losing his foot in a landmine explosion and her mother, an orphan, having been taken in and hidden by a Christian family. 

Charatan worked hard to make herself a success, once noting; 'I knew if I couldn’t be a star, I wouldn’t be happy.'

Along the way she made many friends, and more than a few foes, in the industry.

Durst was said to be drawn to the fact that she had worked her way up in the male dominated industry, and helped her out financially as she went through a difficult divorce and custody hearing as well as numerous lawsuits from agents who claimed they had not received their promised commission from Charatan.

She remains involved in real estate now, having recently taken her $20million share of Durst's $65million settlement from his claims against his family trust, to start a new company with her son, who she reconnected with roughly 10 years ago after not having spoken to the boy for 15 years.

They have an investment office in the Union Square section of Manhattan, and Charatan also recently sold the Fifth Avenue apartment Durst helped her to buy in 1997 and the Bridgehampton home the two shared.

Durst meanwhile is being held in a psychiatric correctional center outside New Orleans.
