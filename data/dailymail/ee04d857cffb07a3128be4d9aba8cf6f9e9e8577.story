A cheeky brown bear soaked its patient canine friend when it sprayed it with water from a garden hose.

Tima, a 300kg bear that has travelled the world performing with the German Shepherd dog since it was adopted in 1995, shows it knows how to have fun, delighting in the hose and even aiming at its companion.

Holding a garden hose in  its paws, the bear lunges its arms back and forth and initially appears to get itself wet.

The playful pair were filmed enjoying the sunshine – and the chance to cool off – near the southern city of Jaen, in Spain.

The  bear, originally from Siberia, holds the hose straight out in front of it to allow the fountain of water to land just beside the dog.

Before it begins lunging its arms once more and spraying water everywhere – eventually managing to hit the dog.

Flinching slightly when sprayed, the German Shepherd moves from its resting position and jumps up to its feet.

The dog then sits with its ears pointing upwards as the bear moves to position itself better, still holding the hose in its paws.

Moving the hose down to the ground, the bear then begins swinging it more erratically and sprays the dog square in the face.

Despite getting wet, the German Shepherd remains patient and stays rooted to its original position – in the bear’s firing line.

Twirling the hose, the bear then manages to wet itself again before redirecting its focus towards the dog and soaking it once more.

The dog then opens its mouth in the hope of having a drink, before shutting it again, shaking off the water and licking its lips.

The video concludes with the bear rising to its feet to spray the dog – who is also stood up on all fours – from a higher position.
