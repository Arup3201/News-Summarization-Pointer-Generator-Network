Jason Scotland-Williams, 34, completed the marathon in just over three hours - knocking more than four hours off his time last year of seven hours 24 minutes

A London Marathon runner - who completed the second half of the race quicker than Olympic champion Mo Farah - is under investigation following claims he jumped over a barrier to slash 10 miles from the route.

Jason Scotland-Williams, 34, completed this year’s marathon in three hours eight minutes - knocking more than four hours off his time last year of seven hours 24 minutes.

The aspiring model, from Hammersmith, London, ran the first half of the marathon in two hours and seven minutes – an average time for an amateur athlete.

However, he ran the second half of the race in just one hour and one minute – quicker than Olympic hero Mo Farah who completed the same stretch in one hour and five minutes.

It means Scotland-Williams finished the race in an impressive three hours and eight minutes – putting him in the top six per cent of competitors.

However, online forums are awash with claims the runner cheated his way to the super-fast time, with some speculating he jumped over a waist-high barrier at the halfway point at Tower Bridge.

It is alleged he jumped the barrier separating the 13-mile marker from the 22-mile point and hid in the crowds while runners looped round Canary Wharf and doubled back.

It is claimed he then jumped back into the race, joining a leading group of runners, and sprinted his way to the finish.

The official London Marathon website logs his progress around the first half of the course, giving updates for every 5kms he completed.

However, it only gives estimated times at the 25km, 30km and 35km markers – which has prompted critics to believe he either cheated his way to the finish by dodging those checkpoints or that his chip failed to activate at those points.

London Marathon organisers are investigating Jason Scotland-Williams' time after he ran the second half of the race in just over an hour. Internet forums are awash with claims he jumped over a barrier in the Tower Bridge area

Jason Scotland-Williams' result suggests he ran the second half of the race in just one hour and one minute – quicker than Olympic champion Mo Farah, above,  who completed the same stretch in one hour five minutes

However, his chip was working as he passed the 40km point and the finish line – which reveals he completed the last 13 miles in just one hour and one minute.

Forum users have questioned the runner’s speedy time, suggesting it would have been a ‘miracle’ if he managed to complete the second half of the race in such a short space of time.

One user, Chris Pearson, posted on a forum on Runners World: ‘First half seems fair enough.  Second half is nothing short of a miracle.

‘It is possible that he ran easy for the first half, then went all out in the second half. 

‘However, it would need a chip malfunction at 25, 30, and 35k for this to have happened.

‘It would also mean that he is capable of running a half at just over 60 minute pace, which again is possible if he was a World class elite runner, but certainly not after doing a 13.1 mile warm up.’ 

Scotland-Williams had posted numerous photos on his Facebook profile of him wearing his marathon medals and showing off his supposed athletic ability. However, the page was closed down this morning

Results on the London Marathon's official website show Jason Scotland-Williams completed the race in three hours eight minutes. However, they also show estimated times were given at the 25K, 30K and 35K markers

Another user, Millsy1977 - a fellow marathon runner - said: ‘If it was legit he would have sped past me on Birdcage walk. I know I was tired but I think I'd have noticed someone 4.30 miling.’

Another marathon runner, Darryl Morris, said: ‘I saw Jason just after Tower Bridge and he was absolutely smashing it’, before adding: ‘Just noted the barrier skip … that would make complete sense as to why I saw him there, looking so fresh!’

And Ryan T said: ‘If he did cheat then I think a ban is in order, I worked very hard for my time this year, did a sub 3:30 for my first marathon and went through a lot of pain in the last three miles, if people are skipping out miles then shame on them!’

Virgin Money London Marathon confirmed Scotland-Williams’ results were being investigated.

A spokesman told The Sun: ‘We have anti-cheating measures during the event, and then post-event when we analyse split times from points around the course.

‘Runners found to have cheated are removed from results and banned from future events.’

Scotland-Williams, who wore a V for Vendetta mask during last weekend’s race, has taken part in the London Marathon for the last six years.

He had posted numerous photos on his Facebook profile of him wearing his marathon medals and showing off his supposed athletic ability. However, his profile was removed from the social-networking site this morning.

This year he was running to raise money for deaf-blind charity Sense.

A spokesman for the charity said: ‘An allegation that a runner cheated at the London Marathon has been brought to our attention.

‘We are urgently investigating and would be very disappointed if this was true.’

The Sun reported it tried to contact Scotland-Williams but was told to ‘f*** off’. 

MailOnline has contacted Virgin Money London Marathon for a comment but organisers have not yet responded.
