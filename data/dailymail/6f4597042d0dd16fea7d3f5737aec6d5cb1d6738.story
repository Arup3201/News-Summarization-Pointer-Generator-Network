The Merced Sun-Star reports that Jorge Miranda, who was looking for cans and bottles Thursday found the hours-old baby under discarded pizza boxes and plastic trash bags.

Found: A newborn baby girl was found in this dumpster beneath pizza boxes and various pieces of trask

Hero: Jimmy Alvarez who lives near the complex where the baby was found wrapped the child in his shirt as his wife called 911 until police arrived to take the baby to the hospital 

They believe the mother of the new-born found half-naked and with the umbilical cord attached lives in or near the apartment building where the girl was found.

They are asking the public to help locate her and say it's too early in the investigation to know if criminal charges will be filed.

'We’re very concerned for the mother’s health and just want to make sure she’s OK,' Capt. Tom Trindad said to the Merced Sun-Star.

'It is still early in the investigation and unknown if criminal charges will be filed.'

Tinidad asked anyone in the neighbourhood who may have known the woman to come forward.

'Anyone who knows of someone who has been pregnant and is no longer pregnant, but has no baby – that’s something we’d like them to contact the detectives about,' Trindad said.

Jimmy Alvarez who lives near the complex where the baby was found heard Jorge Miranda crying for help after Miranda made the horrific discovery. 

Alvarez told reporters that the discovery made Miranda feel, 'very bad.'

He described Miranda as being in shock.

'He was shocked, he was scared,' Alvarez said of Miranda.

'The baby was lying in the corner of the dumpster, half naked, the umbilical cord hanging.'

Alvarez wrapped the child in his shirt and his wife then held the baby until police arrived.

He asked the paramedics if he could name the child 'Milagros' which means miracle'It was a miracle she was there; it was a miracle she was found. I’m just grateful it wasn't dumpster day.'

Hospitals, fire stations, and police stations are 'Safe Surrender' stations where mother's may drop their babies less than three days old without any questions asked.

'We also have information available if someone drops a baby off and later wants them back,' said Billy Alcorn, acting battalion chief.

Miracle: Jimmy Alvarez presents a gift to the baby he calls Milagros meaning miracle because the baby is lucky to be alive after being abandoned in the trash can
