A leading medical expert who has defended parents accused of killing their children in ‘shaken baby’ cases has been accused of being dishonest and misleading the courts.

Dr Waney Squier – a renowned authority on infant brains who has given evidence in dozens of cases where parents have been accused of killing their children - appeared before a fitness to practise panel yesterday charged with ‘bringing the profession into disrepute’.

Dr Waney Squier – a renowned authority on infant brains who has given evidence in dozens of cases where parents have been accused of killing their children 

She is accused of giving evidence beyond her expertise and of failing to be objective and unbiased in her role as an expert witness in six court cases between 2007 and 2010.

The charges could see her struck off if a full tribunal hearing, due to be held in March, finds against her.

And they could have far-reaching consequences for past and future cases of people accused of inflicting serious and fatal brain injuries on babies.

But supporters of Dr Squier, 66, believe she has been the victim of a ‘witch hunt’ by the police, who allegedly want to stop her from giving evidence for the defence in court cases.

For decades the pathologist, who works at the John Radcliffe Hospital in Oxford, appeared as a prosecution witness against accused parents.

She supported mainstream opinion that a combination of three brain injuries – known as the ‘triad’ – was sufficient to prove the baby had been violently shaken.

However, more than ten years ago she was influenced by new research into having a change of heart. She became convinced shaken baby syndrome may not exist and the triad signs could occur naturally in a baby.

Her subsequent expert witness evidence in the defence of parents in court for killing their babies has led to her being controversially brought before the Medical Practitioners Tribunal Service in Manchester.

Dr Squier said she denies all the charges and has promised to ‘put up a very robust defence’.

Around 250 cases a year in the UK involve shaken baby syndrome and if she is cleared by the panel the findings of hundreds of cases may be open to question.

The fitness to practise hearing focuses on six civil and criminal cases in which Dr Squier gave expert testimony.

‘This whole case revolves around expert evidence given in cases of alleged baby shaking,’ said Tom Kark, QC, for the General Medical Council.

There will be two weeks of legal argument before a full public hearing next year. Details of the charges could be changed before the case is heard in March.

Sir Robert Francis, QC, defending Dr Squier, told the panel yesterday: ‘This is a case of considerable substance, great public importance and considerable complexity.

Dr Squier has previously spoken about the continuing battle with the authorities for her opinion to be accepted. Her view that bleeding in the brain can occur naturally in young babies is shared by a minority of pathologists.

In 2011 she said: ‘If I am blocked from giving evidence in court, defendants already having to cope with the tragic death of a baby will not get the benefit of the new science. Equally, if the courts fail to accept that the mainstream view of 30 years ago can no longer be relied upon, there will be serious miscarriages of justice.’

In 2000 Lorraine Harris from Derbyshire was jailed for three years for the manslaughter of her four-month-old baby by shaking.

Dr Squier gave evidence for the prosecution at Nottingham Crown Court, but by the time the appeal was heard in 2005 the expert had made an about-turn about the medical evidence. She appeared for the defence this time and the conviction was quashed.

Three paediatric consultants were criticised by a judge yesterday for suggesting that a baby had been repeatedly shaken by its parents – without giving evidence to back their theory up.

In a case in which a couple faced seeing their three infant daughters being taken into care, the experts said the baby could have been injured after being shaken several times. But Judge Heather Swindells said: ‘There was not an iota of evidence to support such a possibility.’

The judge ordered that the children should stay with their 30-year-old mother and 23-year-old father, whom she described as ‘loving, caring parents’, and she cleared them of having harmed their daughters.

Lincolnshire social workers had applied for the girls – one aged two and twins almost a year old – to be taken into care after doctors claimed one of the twins had received a head injury after being shaken.

The girl became limp and floppy while in her father’s arms last November. The family dialled 999, and the child was found in hospital to have fluid on the brain. There were no other injuries.

At the Family Court in Lincoln, the three consultants gave evidence to back up the theory that the baby had been shaken.

Dr Stephen Chapman of Birmingham Children’s Hospital, Jayaratnam Jayamohan, of John Radcliffe Hospital in Oxford, and Dr George Rylance, who has retired from the Royal Victoria Hospital in Newcastle upon Tyne, cited a 2005 statistical study that found 86 per cent of similar cases were caused by the baby being shaken.

But all suggested the baby may have been injured after being shaken several times.

Judge Swindells said: ‘The universal evidence of health visitors was that the parents are loving, caring parents with good interaction with their children.’

She said the cause of the injury was unknown, and she ‘totally exonerated’ the children’s parents.
