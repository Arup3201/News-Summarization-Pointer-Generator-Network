A British tourist jumped from a second floor hotel window to escape a potential rape attack during a trip to see the Taj Mahal, Indian police said yesterday.

The terrified woman, said to be a London-based dentist in her thirties, fled after the drunk hotel owner allegedly tried to get into her room at 4am offering a 'massage'.

She suffered head, rib and leg injuries, but got to the road and hailed a rickshaw which took her to a police station.

Under arrest: Sachin Chauhan, manager of the Hotel Agra Mahal, has been arrested after a British tourist fled an alleged assault in her room

Jump: The British woman leapt from a second floor balcony (circled) of the Hotel Agra Mahal at the centre of the city

Treatment: An ambulance carrying the British tourist arrives at the district hospital

She told police that Sachin Chauhan, owner of the Hotel Agra Mahal, in Agra, northern India, woke her by knocking on her door.

Senior superintendent Subhash Chandra 
Dubey said: 'When she opened the door, a drunk Sachin offered her a 
“free hand-oil massage” which she refused.

'After a while Sachin returned and knocked on her door again. This scared the woman.

'She thought if she opened the door she could be raped or murdered.

'Eventually Sachin went away but returned for a third time with a security guard and started banging on her door.

'The woman panicked and leaned out of the window and screamed for help.

'When she saw that no help was 
forthcoming, to save herself, the woman jumped from the window and 
landed on the first floor balcony and ran down the stairs out of the 
hotel and on to a tea stall nearby.

Horror: A British tourist was the victim of an attempted rape in Agra, where the Taj Mahal is located

Magnet: Agra draws millions of tourists every year.

'People in the tea stall helped her 
hail an autorickshaw which then took her to the Rakabganj Police 
Station.' The tourist arrived in Agra on Sunday. Last night she was 
believed to be being guarded by police at another hotel.

Chauhan, who is being held at a city 
police station, denies the accusations. He told police he knocked on the
woman's door only because she had asked to be woken up at 4am.

The incident comes after a wave of 
attacks in India, and on the same day that the Foreign Office updated 
its advice to urge women travellers to be cautious in the country.

Attack: Five men suspected of gang-raping a Swiss tourist in central India last week

Outrage: A protester during a demonstration against the men who raped a student in December

Last week, a 39-year-old  Swiss tourist was gang-raped  by eight men in Datia,  Madhya Pradesh.

In December, the fatal gang-rape of a woman on a bus in New Delhi led to mass protests demanding government action.

In response, the government passed a 
law increasing prison terms for rape and providing for the death penalty
in rape cases that result in death or coma.

The Foreign Office advises women to avoid solo travel on public transport, especially at night.

It adds: 'Reported cases of sexual 
assault against women and young girls are increasing; recent sexual 
attacks against female visitors in tourist areas and cities show foreign
women are also at risk.'

The British High Commission in New Delhi said officials had spoken to the woman and were offering her consular assistance.
