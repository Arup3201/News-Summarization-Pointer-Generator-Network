An incredible photo has captured the moment a shark leaps out of the water at a Coffs Harbour beach, just metres away from surfers and paddle boarders.

During a surf contest at Macauley's, on the north coast of New South Wales on Sunday, the photo shows the clam before it's presence is known and there's a frenzy in the water to get out quickly.

The Coffs Coast Advocate said the shark reportedly leapt into the air twice as the mums of the Coffs Harbour Boardriders club were in the water during a competition. 

The photo was taken by spectator Steph Bellamy who couldn't believe what she had captured on her camera after seeing a splash in the distance.

During a surf contest at Macauley's, on the north coast of New South Wales (pictured) on Sunday, an incredible photo was taken that shows a shark breaching from the water

Once the shark sighting was confirmed, the alarm was raised.  

'My arms are so sore from paddling back into shore, but at least I still have arms,' surfer Sharni Winkler jokingly told the Coffs Coast Advocate.

Husband and former ASP tour competition Lee Winkler was about 30 metres from where the shark breached and said those closest knew exactly what it was.

'Yeah I thought it was a tuna or a fish, but when the image came through on the beach I couldn't believe it, an almighty shark jumping through the line-up.'

The shark which jumped out of the water is seen just metres away from surfers and paddle boarders at Coffs Harbour

The species is not yet known but it suggestions are it could have been a Thresher Shark (as pictured)

A mako shark (pictured) the species of the shark is not yet known but it's believed it could be a mako shark

Suggestions are the shark sighted could have been a spinner shark (similar to one pictured) 

The open men's section did continue competing after about 15 minutes, as organisers monitored the break for any sight of the shark. 

It has not yet been confirmed the species of the shark, as the NSW department of primary industries investigate but there's been suggestions it could be a spinner, thresher or mako shark.
