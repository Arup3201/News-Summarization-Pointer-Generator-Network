Gabrielle Giffords reclaimed the dark day she was shot three years ago by showing her courageous determination to survive with a daring skydive.

The former Congresswoman jumped thousands of feet from a plane to mark the third anniversary of the attack in Tucson, Arizona, expressing through her actions what she is no longer able to express in words.

Ms Giffords, 43, was shot in the head in January 2011 in Tucson, Arizona, by a gunman in
 a horrific attack that left six others dead and 13 wounded.

Gabby Giffords achieved an important milestone on her road to recovery this week by sky-diving in Eloy, Arizona

Ms Giffords, the face of the national 
gun control effort, has made a grueling but remarkable recovery, 
learning how to talk and walk again.

Ms Giffords rang a bell with her husband, astronaut and Navy veteran Mark Kelly to remember the events of that terrible day. Then it was time to take to the skies. 

Before the dive in Eloy, the former Congresswoman received a call from Vice President Joe Biden who told her: 'I tell you what you got more spunk, as my mother would say, than ten of the best people I know.'

Afterwards she thanked the VP on Twitter, adding: 'Join me next time?'

She did the tandem skydive jump with her friend, former Navy SEAL Jimmy Hatch. She bonded with the veteran several years ago and visited him after he had been shot while serving in Afghanistan. He in turn visited her in the hospital after she was shot.

He told the Today show
 that Giffords was 'incredible'. Her mother Gloria said her daughter had
 been 'fearless' since she was a child but became choked with emotion 
when asked about how she felt on the anniversary of the shooting.

After the dive Giffords blew kisses to the media, waved, and described the experience as 'wonderful' and 'good stuff' to the Today  show. 

Sitting with her husband after the jump, Ms Giffords told the Today show that her skydive had a 'lot of mountains, a lot of sky' and was 'peaceful, so peaceful'.

She said that it reminded her: 'I'm alive'.

Today show host Savannah Guthrie asked Ms Giffords what emotions she had on January 8, the anniversary of the attack, to which she replied 'happy and sad' but that she wanted to 'move on and move ahead'.

The former Congresswoman and her husband Navy veteran and astronaut Mark Kelly said they were moving on following the attack in 2011

The former Congresswoman demonstrated how she viewed her recovery as a slow uphill battle but added that she was 'optimistic'

Ms Giffords is now able to make small movements on her right side which was totally paralyzed and is gathering more of her power of speech.

She is still able to sing and gave a rousing rendition of Tomorrow from Annie. She also wants to become fluent in Spanish again and relearn the French horn.

When asked by Guthrie if she would like to return to political office, Ms Giffords said 'a little bit later', saying that although her recovery was slow, she felt 'pretty good, optimistic'.

Earlier
 in the week, officials also announced plans for a permanent memorial in
 remembrance of the shootings expected to be located at the Old Pima 
County Courthouse and in an adjacent park.

The
 sites would display some of the thousands of items, including letters, 
candles and flags, that were placed in storage after forming makeshift 
memorials across the city in the days after the shooting.

'This
 memorial will remind the world of what happened here,' U.S. Rep. Ron 
Barber said. 'But more importantly... what happened afterward: the 
kindness, the caring and love that came forward.

Honor: Flowers are lined up on the third anniversary at the site of the Tucson shootings on Wednesday. Six people were killed and 13 wounded in the attack in January 2011

'And you will see that when you look at the archives, it represents Tucson at its very, very best.'

Giffords also pleaded for patience in gun control in an op-ed printed in the New York Times on Wednesday's third anniversary of the attack.

The former Congresswoman 
she likened her gun control fight to her time in recovery writing: 'Our 
fight is a lot more like my rehab. Every day, we must wake up resolved 
and determined.

'We’ll pay 
attention to the details; look for opportunities for progress, even when
 the pace is slow. Some progress may seem small, and we might wonder if 
the impact is enough, when the need is so urgent. '

But
 every day we will recruit a few more allies, talk to a few more elected
 officials, convince a few more voters. Some days the steps will come 
easily; we’ll feel the wind at our backs. Other times our knees will 
buckle. We’ll tire of the burden. I know this feeling. But we’ll 
persist.

'We can get tough and win elections. We’ll support our allies. And those who stood in the way will face a powerful advocacy community standing between them and re-election.

Ms Giffords is pro-gun ownership but anti-gun violence.

Miracle: The first look at Giffords in hospital shows her scars and bruises after she was shot in the head

In October Ms Giffords toured rows of 
tables loaded with rifles and handguns today in her first visit to a gun
 show since surviving the 2011 shooting.

She
 visited the Saratoga Springs Arms Fair with Mr
 Kelly and New York Attorney General Eric Schneiderman to highlight a 
voluntary agreement that closely monitors gun show sales in New York.

We
 must never stop fighting,' she said at a post-tour news conference, her
 fist in the air. 'Fight! Fight! Fight! Be bold! Be courageous!'

Ms Giffords, slowly walked 
hand-in-hand with Mr Kelly through the large room where Winchester 
rifles, muzzle-loaders, antique knives and other weapons were on display
 and 'Don't Tread on Me' flags hung from poles.

They
 stopped at display tables, Mr Kelly asked dealers questions about the 
weapons, and Ms Giffords shook hands and smiled when people greeted her.

'Good to see you looking good!' some said.

Kelly bought a book on Colt revolvers, and said later he probably would have bought a gun if he had had more time. He said both he and his wife are gun owners.

The
 trio mixed with a gun show crowd that was mostly welcoming - with a few
 hostile undertones before calling for people to build on the 
cooperative effort.

In June it was revealed Mr Kelly likes to do target practice with exactly the same kind of gun which was used to shoot her - as she cheers him on from their porch.

The couple admit they still love the ‘gun culture’ and argue that their knowledge of guns gives them more credibility with the gun lobby and the National Rifle Association.

They have made themselves strident gun campaigners and Giffords’ face is now on a huge billboard in New York’s Times Square asking for tougher checks on those buying firearms.

Mr Kelly bought the assault rifle in March at a gun shop in Tucson to show how easy it was to buy such a weapon.

But after his motives became public the shop owner refused to hand it over and gave him a refund, claiming that it was not for ‘personal use’ so he could not sell it.

At the time, Todd Rathner, a lobbyist for the National Rifle Association's affiliate in Arizona and a national NRA board member, questioned the point that Mr Kelly was trying to make.

He said: ‘If you believe him, it's a cheap publicity stunt. If you don't, then he was speculating on the value of the rifle because he knew the prices would be inflated.’
