Archaeologists excavating the inner courtyard of a former Dominican monastery may have discovered a Romanian Romeo and Juliet after unearthing the bodies of a young couple who were buried holding hands.

Experts from the Cluj-Napoca Institute of Archaeology and History of Art are working on what they believe is the former cemetery of the monastery have already uncovered several bodies

But discovering the couple holding hands was a surprise as double burials were extremely rare in that period.

Forever holding hands: Archaeologists excavating the courtyard of a former Dominican monastery in Cluj-Napoca have been left baffled after discovering the bodies of a young couple who were buried holding hands

Double: Experts from the Cluj-Napoca Institute of Archaeology and History of Art were baffled when they came across the double grave dating back to the Middle Ages

Main researcher Adrian Rusu said: 'It
is a mystery - and rare for such burials at that time.

'We can see that 
the man had suffered a severe injury that left him with a broken hip 
from which he probably died. We believe the injury was caused after he 
was hit by something very blunt and hard.'

Because of the fact that the young 
woman obviously died at the same time and was presumably healthy we are 
speculating that she possibly died of a broken heart at the loss of her 
partner.

Mr Rusu explained that becuase suicide was regarded as a sin in the Medieval Ages it is unlikely she killed herself - and if she had they would not have been buried together like the were in a holy place.

'They were obviously buried together as a tribute to the love they had for each other,' he said.

He estimated that the two bodies were
buried somewhere between 1450-1550.

The body
of a child was also found in the grave in Cluj-Napoca although this may not have been 
linked to the pair.

The lower leg bones of a fourth skeleton were also found in the burial plot.

Star-crossed lovers. Were the young couple buried in the graveyard like Leonardo Dicaprio and Claire Danes in Rome and Juliet?
