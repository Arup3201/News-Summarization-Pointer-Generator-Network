Doing military-style exercises in the freezing cold is not the way many youngsters would choose to spend their school holidays.

But these 50 young South Koreans were said to be 'delighted' to take part in a four-day 'self-denial' camp designed to improve their mental and physical discipline.

Computer games and fast food were strictly off the menu as the hardy youngsters were put through their paces at the Cheongryong Self-denial Training Camp on Daebu Island near Seoul.

No pain no gain: South Korean elementary and middle school students go through a series of stretching exercises at the Cheongryong Self-denial Training Camp on Daebu Island near the capital city, Seoul

While the average teenager would still have been in bed, these hardy youngsters were yelling with a mixture of pain and exuberance while doing 'air bicycle' exercises, endurance runs and star jumps at the camp.

Thousands of children across South Korea take part in similar camps during their school holidays, in what is seen as a key stepping stone on their journey to adulthood

Campers are woken early and sent out in the cold to do stretching exercises before breakfast. Many are also taught military songs and have all possessions taken from them.

In total exercises can last for up to 10 hours a day, leaving children thoroughly exhausted.

Military service - not related to these 
camps - is compulsory in South Korea, with all citizens having to serve 
in the armed forces for two years.

Camps are often run by retired marines who set the youngsters military-style tasks, including endurance and problem solving.

The
camps are also held during the summer months when youngsters - some as 
young as 12 - have been told to wade through mud and freezing rivers.

The camps are also a popular way for hard-pressed parents to get a much-needed break from their children during the holiday period.

They are also seen as a good way of helping to encourage physical activity among the young, as obesity levels continue to rise.

Many youngsters make life-long friendships while on the camps - which test those involved to their limits.

Despite the obvious physical discomforts of camp life, many young people enjoy the active and disciplined environment.

The harsh courses are believed to help improve the work ethic and determination of those who take part - equipping them for the competitive world of work.
