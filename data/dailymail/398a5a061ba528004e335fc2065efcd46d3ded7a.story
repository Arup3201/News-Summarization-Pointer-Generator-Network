Eleven people from a indigenous tribe in Colombia were killed when lightning struck a thatch-roofed hut during a ritual.

Another 15 members of the Wiwa tribe, who live high in the Sierra Nevada range on Colombia's Caribbean coast, were injured with burns, six seriously, officials said.

The electrical storm took place around midnight as the tribe was performing a traditional ceremony accompanied by tribe shamans known as 'Mamos.'

The Sierra Nevada de Santa Marta is an isolated mountain range that runs through Colombia, on the northern tip of South America.

It is home to four indigenous tribes who comprise the remnants of the native American Tairona culture, now living on Resguardos Indigenas (Indian reserves) located in the mid-highlands.

Spiritual: According to Survival, an organisation that campaigns for the rights of tribal people, the Sierra Indians call themselves 'the older brothers' and believe their mystical wisdom surpasses that of outsiders
