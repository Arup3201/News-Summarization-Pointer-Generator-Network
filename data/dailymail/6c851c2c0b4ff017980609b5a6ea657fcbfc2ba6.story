An apparent Bigfoot sighting in Pennsylvania has been labelled a scam after the mythical creature turned out to a huge tree stump.

Hiker John Stoneman claimed he spotted not one but two of the seven-foot-tall ape-like beasts three weeks ago through the trees, just yards from a main road in Kinzua State Park near Bradford.

But a tipster told HuffPost Weird News either Stoneman was lying or he didn't know he was actually staring at a chunk of a tree that had been uprooted by well drillers.

Is it Bigfoot? John Stoneman's close up photo, pictured, apparently shows one of the 'beasts' spotted just yards from a main road through trees in Kinzua State Park

Stumped: A tipster sent this photo of the same apparent Bigfoot to HuffPost Weird News on Thursday

The anonymous debunker sent the website a photograph of what appeared to be the same figure
Stoneman saw, but from a different angle, to prove his theory.

'It was a scam,' the tipster said.

Stoneman's pictures went viral after he posted them online.

The 57-year-old explained he had been returning 
from the Kinzua Bridge Fall Festival with his girlfriend when the pair 
saw the mysterious shape moving in the forest.

He quickly grabbed his camera and snapped a few shots as they slowed the car down and edged along the road.

Traffic
backing-up behind his vehicle forced Stoneman to move on but not before he 
got what he believes is some of the best evidence yet of the existence 
of the legendary North American creature.

Stoneman, from Bradford, said at the time: 'I'm a skeptic myself, I'm not a believer, but this was not a bear and you can see fur on it.

'It's
wider at the shoulders and tapers down whereas a bear is bigger in the 
middle and stands differently with its paws out, this was standing like a
man, like a Bigfoot.

Two beasts: Stoneman claimed this image, taken just two weeks ago near Bradford, Pennsylvania, showed two of the mysterious creatures known as Bigfoot wandering through the woods

Lurking: The photographs were taken by keen hiker John Stoneman who was on his way home with his girlfriend from a festival with his girlfriend when the pair spotted the mysterious shape moving in the forest

Debate: Stoneman's photographs fueled the debate on whether the legendary creature actually exists

'At first some people have 
discredited it and said it's just a root ball at the bottom of a fallen 
tree, but I've been back to the exact spot and there is no root ball 
there.

'We do have black bears, but they are considerably smaller than this, it was standing about seven-foot tall.'

The day before the sighting Stoneman said there had been a 'Bigfoot calling contest' organised as part of the bridge festival - an event held annually in the area to commemorate an old viaduct destroyed by a tornado.

He said: 'This was 200 yards from the road, it was too narrow for me to be able to pull over without stopping traffic but I got as many pictures as I could.

'I actually dropped the camera casing
so I couldn't see what I had got until I got home and put them on my 
computer, I was surprised at what I saw.

'I looks more like a bigfoot than anything else, I've already had organisations asking me to send them copies for verification.'

Stoneman
- who is a member of the local outdoor pursuits group Allegheny Outdoor
Adventures - said he had never seen anything like it in the woods 
before.

He said: 'This area is known for 
Bigfoot sightings but this is the first time I have seen anything like 
this, I am in the woods every week, I hunt and go hiking.

'I went back to the exact spot where it had been and there was nothing there, just years and years of leaves on the floor.'

It
came as researchers told a new conference in Texas that they have 
proof Bigfoot is real and have even collected DNA samples.Â 

Location: Outdoorsman John Stoneman, pictured, said he was previously a skeptic but the strange 'creature' convinced him

The Sasquatch Genome Project has spent $500,000 on collecting data and evidence over the past five years.

Bigfoot, also known as sasquatch, is the name given to an ape-like creature that some people believe inhabits forests, mainly in the Pacific Northwest region of North America. Bigfoot is usually described as a large, hairy, bipedal humanoid.

In 1951 American Eric Shipton photographed what he described as a Yeti footprint beginning a spate of 'sightings' and print finds throughout the 20th and 21st century.
