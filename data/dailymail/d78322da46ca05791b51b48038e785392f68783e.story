So close: Jack wowed the crowd on BGT's grand finale, but lost out to Hungarian theatre group Attraction

Britain's Got Talent star Jack Carroll was getting tips on comedy from disgraced comedian Jason Manford to perpare for his act on last night's final.

Despite the words of wisdom given to 14-year-old Jack in the lead up to the finale show, he lost out on the top prize to Hungarian theatre group Attraction.

After losing out on the top spot, the teenage comedian took his defeat in good humour.

The schoolboy, who has cerebral palsy, struck up a friendship with stand-up Jason Manford when he appeared on The One Show in 2010, just before Manford resigned from the BBC programme after admitting sending sexual messages to female fans on Twitter.

Huddersfield-born Jack said: ‘We’ve always kept in touch and Jason has been helping me out with my act.

'Over
 the past week I have been talking to him on the phone every night. 
Jason is helping me polish up my act and making it more professional. 
He’s been brilliant.’

Jack has also been taking career advice from Britain’s Got Talent judge David Walliams.

‘David
 is my favourite judge – hopefully he will one day be a colleague in the
 industry,’ he said.

‘I love watching his TV series. We’ve talked about 
agents and who  I should get to represent me.

‘But he said I had a long career ahead of me, so I don’t need to rush in. I would like to work with David in the future – Little Britain was one of the inspirations for my act.’

Jack went into the final as second favourite, behind Hungarian shadow theatre group Attraction.

In stitches: 14-year-old Jack had hosts Ant and Dec laughing. He had received words of advice from comedians Jason Manford, Peter Kay and BGT judge David Walliams

Before the verdict: Jack and the members of Attraction were left to battle it out for the title of BGT winner

In good humour: Jack Carroll continued to joke around once he heard he was the runner-up

He became an overnight success when he appeared in the audition and told Simon Cowell he was ‘a professional gymnast’.

He said: ‘It has all got a bit crazy since I first appeared. People certainly recognise me, which feels a bit odd.

'Girls come up to me and ask for my photo in the street. Who knows? I might get a girlfriend through Britain’s Got Talent.’
