'Vindictive': Malcolm Simpson was jailed for seven years after he twice set fire to Alison Biggs' house and another neighbour's car

A ‘vindictive’ pensioner was jailed today for setting fire to his neighbour’s house after she ended their fling and refused to pay him for mowing her lawn.

Malcolm Simpson, 68, who set fire to Alison Biggs’ house twice and another neighbour’s car in Maidenhead, Berkshire, was sentenced to seven years jail. 

Reading Crown Court heard how the former serviceman doused petrol in Ms Biggs’ kitchen on the first occasion. He then started a fire in the hallway after the property was put up for sale.

The pensioner even rang his victim's mobile phone to tell her about the fire. 

Simpson’s extreme behaviour could have occurred after he felt Ms Biggs, aged 49 years, owed him money for several free jobs he carried out for her including mowing the lawn and fitting a shower, the prosecution said.

Ms Biggs told the jury at Simpson's trial that she had ‘lost absolutely everything’ in the fires Simpson started.

She told how her neighbour had been persecuting her for months in the lead up to the first blaze in October 2011.

Ms Biggs said she believed Simpson had thrown cat faeces into her garden, smashed windows, deliberately played music too loud, slashed her tyres, super-glued her front door locked, cut her cable TV wires and blocked an overflow pipe.

She added that she had been staying at a friend's house in the days before the fire because ‘I didn't feel safe there’.

The pair had also had a brief sexual relationship but Ms Biggs refused to continue it further, the court heard.

Simpson first struck on October 15, 2011 before returning again to Ms Biggs’ home next to his in on May 24 last year.

A Toyota L200 pick-up truck belonging to builder and decorator Martin Bedwell, 56, was also set alight on his driveway - two doors down from Simpson’s house - on October 9, last year.

Police believed the Bedwell family had shown sympathy towards Ms Biggs’ situation and had allowed builders renovating the property the use of their electricity, the judge heard.

Prosecutor Jane Davies said: ‘In relation to matters today there were two complainants - one being Ms Biggs in relation to two fires and the Bedwell family.

‘I do ask for a restraining order for
an unlimited period of time, in light of the defendant’s ties with that
locality and I don’t know what his future will be when he is released 
from prison.

‘It may be 
that a condition of his licence is that the defendant doesn’t return to 
that locality. I think it’s right that the property was owned by the 
Housing Association.’

'I didn't feel safe there': Ms Biggs, who ended a brief relationship with Simpson, said she 'lost absolutely everything' in the fires at her home (pictured centre after rebuilding), which is next door to Simpson's home (far right)

Simpson was convicted of three counts of arson being reckless as to whether life was endangered, by a jury after a trial concluded on June 3.

Alan Walker, defending, said: ‘Most importantly no one was injured as a result of these events.

‘On at least one occasion Mr Simpson himself rang the fire services. On another occasion he phoned Alison Biggs, the owner of the property.’

The barrister said his client had always maintained his innocence over the matter.

Mr Walker said: ‘He is of ill health. He has suffered a heart attack over the last two years.'

Simpson served in the Armed Forces for seven years, including two tours of Northern Ireland.

Addressing
the defendant, Judge John Reddihough said: ‘It is quite plain you held a
strong grudge against your former neighbour Alison Biggs.

‘That may have been because she declined to continue a sexual relationship with you or because she had not repaid money to you.

‘Be
that as it may, it is clear that you set out to make her life a misery 
and once she left her home you twice deliberately set that house on 
fire, as the jury found, reckless as to whether life of persons would be
endangered.

'Wicked' campaign: At Reading Crown Court (pictured) judge John Reddihough said it was clear that Simpson held a 'strong grudge' against Ms Biggs

‘Plainly you regularly accessed her house and, as I find, damaged the roof of it prior to the second fire no doubt seeking to exacerbate the effects of the fire you had set. You also removed property belonging to Ms Biggs from her home. As a result of those two fires considerable damage was caused and there was a financial loss that you clearly intended. So easily the lives of neighbours could have been put at risk.

‘You then deliberately set fire to a vehicle belonging to the Bedwell family. You were seen running from the scene. The vehicle was close to their house and the fire could so easily have spread and trapped the family inside with fatal consequences.

‘It is indeed fortunate they were able to leave their home. Only you know why you targeted the Bedwells in that way. It might be that they were sympathetic to Ms Biggs or you resented them for helping builders carrying out work on her former home. You will be sentenced for wickedly setting three quite separate fires and being reckless as to whether life would be endangered.’

The Judge added: ‘Only a substantial custodial sentence is appropriate for such serious, calculated and potentially life-threatening behaviour.’

'We've had enough of him': Detective Sergeant Peter Wall said people were intimidated by Simpson (who lived in the house on the far right) and had lived in the area for 40 years

A restraining order was also made banning Simpson from making direct or indirect contact with Ms Biggs or the Bedwell family who gave evidence at the trial.

Simpson looked emotionless as he was led away to begin his sentence.

Speaking after the case, Detective Sergeant Peter Wall of Thames Valley Police said: ‘He was a vindictive individual.

‘It is quite unclear as to how the fires happened. He had ready access to accelerants - oil, petrol. We believe this individual has been terrorising neighbours for many years in that street.

‘He’s lived there for 40 years. There was very little interest from the community initially because he is obviously quite a vindictive character and people were intimidated by him.

‘Subsequently as things have gone on we have managed to gather evidence and engage with people and got more support.

‘The success of the case is down to the community saying we’ve had enough of this man now and we want to do something about him.’
