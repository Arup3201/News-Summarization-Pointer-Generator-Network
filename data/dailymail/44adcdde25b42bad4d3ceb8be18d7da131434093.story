A man in Saudi Arabia has been arrested for 'exotic practices' after offering free hugs to passers-by.

Abdulrahman al-Khayyal, 21, and a friend were apprehended by the state's religious police after they were seen walking down a street in Riyadh holding a placard which read 'free hugs'.

The two men are believed to have been inspired by a viral video of a campaign posted on YouTube earlier this week.

Al-Khayyal was inspired by Bandr al-Swed (above), whose Free Hug video went viral on YouTube

In the original video, Bandr al-Swed was seen embracing men in a three-minute clip that garnered more than a million hits in three days.

The Free Hugs Campaign is a movement that sees individuals offer hugs to strangers in public places, especially in 
big cities, 'to brighten up their lives'.

Al-Khayyal announced on Twitter that he would offer free hugs to the public on Tahlia street, a popular shopping area in the ultra-conservative Muslim kingdom's capital.

He and his friend were arrested there while waving banners marked 'Free Hug' in English, according to news website Sabq.org.

Although they were made to promise they would not repeat their actions, al-Khayyal told the Independent he was proud of what he had done and would carry on as he considered it charitable.

The incident has prompted surprise and controversy in Saudi society.

'It's a free hug, not a free drug for God's sake!' wrote one Tweeter in support of the campaign.

However, another user slammed the move. 'Today it's one hug, tomorrow it's a free kiss, and the next day it'll be free sex!'

The religious police, or Commission for the Promotion of Virtue and Prevention of Vice, is charged with ensuring compliance with the kingdom's strict interpretation of Islamic morality.

They are also empowered to stop unrelated men and women socialising with each other, as well as any homosexual activity and prostitution.

But the force is often accused of abuses.

Religious police ensure women obey Saudi Arabia's ban on women drivers, implement a ban on public entertainment and force all businesses to close for prayers five times a day.
