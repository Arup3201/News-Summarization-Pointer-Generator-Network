Belfast is braced for its most violent week of rioting since the Good Friday Agreement after 29 police officers were hurt in sectarian clashes at the weekend.

More than 1,000 thugs, believed to be supported by loyalist paramilitaries, bombarded police and nationalists with petrol bombs, fireworks and rocks following a demonstration against the decision to limit the number of days the Union Flag is flown from City Hall.

Masked hooligans, many draped in Union Flags, also set cars alight and used makeshift battering rams to attack police riot vehicles.

Water cannons and non-lethal baton 
rounds were fired by officers as they came under a hail of bricks and 
fireworks when they separated the opposing factions at an interface 
flashpoint on the Albertbridge Road near Short Strand.

Demonstrators
 were returning from a protest outside Belfast City Hall 
against the council's decision to restrict the flying of the Union flag.

As the loyalists approached the Short Strand there was violence across 
the interface with missiles being thrown by rival factions, which 
resulted in a number of properties being damaged in the Short Strand.

Police used water cannons and fired six baton rounds as they forced the 
two sides apart. Four officers were taken to hospital, two have been 
discharged.

The chief constable said: 'This was a difficult operation dealing with a
 large number of people determined to cause disorder and violence. My 
colleagues brought the situation under control with exceptional courage 
and professionalism.'

It comes as Stormont's First Minister said the only way to end violence in Northern Ireland is through the political process.

Peter Robinson condemned those 
responsible for injuring dozens of police officers and costing the local
 economy millions but said protesters had become alienated.

'There are political issues and people
 that feel disengaged and people that feel if we are trying to build a 
shared future they are not getting their share,' he said.

Countless roads have been blocked 
during the loyalist campaign - in one case north of Belfast a pensioner 
trying to visit his dying wife in hospital was turned back.

He said: 'If your wife was dying what 
would you be doing? Have a bit of sense. Protestants, you don't know the
 meaning of the word, take yourselves home, show a bit of respect for 
people.'

They responded by jeering 'cheerio' in a recording made by the BBC.

In west Belfast a GP was twice prevented from attending a home visit with a patient terminally ill with cancer.

Nationalist SDLP MLA Conall McDevitt 
said: 'These are depraved acts which immediately dismiss any claim on a 
protest being peaceful.'

An ugly brawl happened as loyalists 
returned from a demonstration at city hall, against the council's 
decision to limit the number of days the union flag is flown.

The turmoil over the past five weeks has been some of the most sustained in the British-ruled province since 1998

Riot police faced hundreds of masked men on Friday night around the lower Newtownards Road area - showing there is no sign of a halt to the protests.

The turmoil over the past five weeks has been some of the most sustained in the British-ruled province since a 1998 peace deal ended 30 years of conflict between Catholic Irish nationalists seeking union with Ireland and Protestant loyalists determined to remain part of the United Kingdom.

Exposing a deep vein of discontent with the peace deal, loyalists have held nightly protests since councillors voted last month to end a century-old tradition of flying the British union flag every day over the city hall.

It has been announced senior politicians from Belfast, Dublin and London are to meet next week to discuss the protests.

Stormont First Minister Peter Robinson and his deputy Martin McGuinness will join Northern Ireland Secretary Theresa Villiers and Ireland's Tanaiste (deputy leader) Eamonn Gilmore.

Mr Gilmore said: 'This violence is being orchestrated and those behind it are known criminals, intent on creating chaos.

'This has nothing to do with real issues around flags and identity in a shared society, which are the subject of intensive political discussions at present.'

Ms Villiers urged restraint.

'We can't afford to have these continuing protests damage our economy and destroy potential jobs for Northern Ireland's young people,' she said.

Sinn Fein President Gerry Adams said there should be a cross-community response.

'But there can be no going back. The tiny minorities who want to cling to the past must be rejected. Sectarianism must be tackled and ended.'

Ulster Unionist Party leader Mike Nesbitt has co-chaired a unionist forum designed to address grievances.

'Street violence from so-called unionists, no matter what age, advances nothing but the cause of Irish nationalism. It is high time those involved in rioting realised they are destroying the very cause the hope to promote.'
