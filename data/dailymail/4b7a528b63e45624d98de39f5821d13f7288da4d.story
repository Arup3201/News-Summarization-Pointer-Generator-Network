Dr. Ben Carson, a pediatric surgeon-turned-politician, emerged as a major conservative darling on Saturday in Iowa by harping on the Obama administration's immigraton and health care policy – and saying a new approach to energy could put Russian Presdient Vladimir Putin 'back in his little box.'

The long-shot potential White House hopeful drew the biggest ovations by far at the morning session of the Iowa Freedom Summit, as GOP presidential hopefuls jockeyed for position.

'We need to use our natural resources' to generate a new economic recovery, Carson said.

'We're the number one producer of oil now, on 3 per cent of the land! The federal governmnt has no business owning all this land. This is craziness!'

The thousand-plus crowd roared.

'And all the natural gas we have! Now we have the ability to liquefy natural gas,' Carson reminded them, 'which means we can export it.'

'THIS IS CRAZINESS!': Ben Carson said Saturday that federal public lands should be in private hadns so they can be tapped for oil and gas

IN A BOX: Russian President Vladimir Putin's economic running room is getting smaller as oil prices drop, and Carson says America should tighten the screws even more

John Bolton, a former US ambassador to the United Nations, said Russia is in an ever-tighter spot as oil prices fall – whether from Saudi price manipulation or American drilling and fracking

Then the soft-spoken man with a dramatic following and a fundraising-savvy 'draft' movement pushing him to run took aim at Russia. 

'We need to use those energy resources not only to enhance our economic situation, but also to pay down our debt – and to put Putin back in his little box, y'know?' 

Plummeting oil prices on the global market, driven by a Saudi Arabian strategy designed to cripple Iran, have also created a near-existential crisis in Moscow.

In June 2014 the price of a barrel of Brent crude hovered near $115. On Friday it was $49.

While Russia has its conglomerate natural gas production to fall back on, its economy has faltered more as the bottom of the oil market slips lower.

And U.S. economic sanctions leveled after military incursions into neighboring Ukraine have added to Putin's headaches.

Former U.S. ambassador to the United Nations John Bolton, who spoke after lunch, told Daily Mail Online in an interview on the summit's sidelines that 'The Russians live hand to mouth with their oil revenues, as do the Iranians, and who knows what could happen if prices plummet again and again?'

'I think the Saudis' main target in allowing the price to fall was Iran, but they got a lot of collateral damage out of it as well – in Russia, in Venezuela, in Algeria.'

Bolton also cited 'our fracking here' as a factor.

'While the Saudis, the Emiratis, the Kuwaitis and others can sustain for some considerable period of time oil at this level, it has an immediate palpable effect on Iran and russia and others.'

'And I think the Saudis understood that.' 

Carson believes the United States should grasp the idea too, and use it as a foreign affairs sledgehammer.

He got bigger applause with a proposal to shrink the federal government 'by attrition.' 

'Thousands of government employees retire every year. Don't replace them,' he said. 

'You do that for about four or five years, and all of a sudden you've got the government down to a manageable size ... They won't have time to stick their big noses in everybody's business.

'The government tries to insert itself into everything,' he emphasized.

'They want to tell you how to take care of your children, what you should feed them, how you should discipline them.'

'You know what? I would be happy to accept the advice of the government if they were doing everything perfectly.'

Carson spoke at the Iowa Freedom Summit on January 24 in Des Moines, Iowa as a host of potential 2016 Republican presidential candidates jousted on core conservative principles

RUSSIA NEXT?  Sliding oil prices have sent Venezuela on a downward spiral and sent President Nicolas Maduro on a trip to China to make an urgent appeal for cash; government-controlled supermarkets are limiting what citizens can purchase as the bottom falls out of the nations economy

And the rafters shook when he gave a quiet but firm sermon on immigration policy – squarely targeting President Barack Obama's plan to mainstream 5 million or more illegal immigrants with residency IDs and work permits.

'We already have laws that demonstrate how a person becomes an American citizen,' Carson said. 'We don't need to relitigate that.'

'If we do relitigate that, it has to be by the proper branch of government – Congress – not by the president, not by the Supreme Court.'

Whichever Republican wins the White House – his assumption – 'should make it their goal to seal that border within a year,' he intoned.

'Do we have the ability to seal the border? Sure we do. We just don't have the will to seal the border.'

He insisted, though, that Republicans should 'integrate compassion' into their immigration policy and give illegal immigrants a pathway to work in the U.S. – under certain strict circumstances.

'I don't think they should have to hide in the shadows,' he said, pointing to Canada's guest worker program as a model.

'We shouldn't offer jobs unless Americans won't take them. And in order to get a guest worker permit, you have to apply for it from outside of America.'

'You shouldn't get an advantage for breaking the law,' he said. 

DRILL, BABY, DRILL: Saudi Arabia dropped oil prices by more than half in order to cripple regional rival Iran – but Russia, Venezuela and Algeria have become collateral damage

Carson leaped into the national consciousness in 2013 by saying during a National Prayer Breakfast speech that the Affordable Care Act – Obamacare – was the worst thing to happen to the United States 'since slavery.'

Carson, an African-American, said so with a more famous black man, President Obama, sitting two seats away. 

'We do not need the government controlling our healthcare,' he reiterated on Saturday. 

'Even if it worked, I would oppose it. [But] it doesn't.'

'I don't believe in taking the most important thing a person has, which is their health, their healthcare, and putting it in the hands of the government,' Carson said, 'because if they control your healthcare, it's not long before they control your whole life.'

'And that changes the entire relationship.'
