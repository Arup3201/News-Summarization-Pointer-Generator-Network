Cheek-to-cheek and hand-in-hand as they met on a wind-swept airport runway, they only had eyes for each other.

And if Australia's prime minister Julia Gillard was half-hearted when she welcomed the Queen to her country last month, she certainly did not hold back with Barack Obama.

The pair exchanged a warm embrace on the tarmac at Canberra airport as the president flew in for a whirlwind visit before heading on to Indonesia.

They later held a joint press conference in which they unveiled
plans to deepen the U.S. military presence in the Asia-Pacific, with 
2,500 U.S. marines operating out of a de facto base in northern 
Australia.

U.S. troops and aircraft will operate
out of the tropical city of Darwin, only 820 kms from Indonesia, able 
to respond quickly to any humanitarian and security issues in Southeast 
Asia, where disputes over sovereignty of the South China Sea are causing
rising tensions.

'With my visit to the region, I am 
making it clear that the United States is stepping up its commitment to 
the entire Asia-Pacific region,' Mr Obama said.

'It is appropriate for us to make 
sure...that the security architecture for the region is updated for the 
21st century and this initiative is going to allow us to do that.'

Mr Obama said he was deeply concerned about the euro zone crisis and warned that market turmoil would continue until Europe has a concrete plan to deal with its sovereign debt worries.

His comments came as equity markets fell in response to a sell-off in euro zone bond markets.    

'Until we put in place a concrete plan and structure that sends a clear signal to the markets that Europe is standing behind the euro and will do what it takes, we are going to continue to see the kinds of market turmoil we saw,' he said.

He added that while there had been progress in putting together unity governments in Italy and Greece, Europe still faced a 'problem of political will' rather than a technical problem.               

'We're going to continue to advise European leaders on what options we think would meet the threshold where markets would settle down. It is going to require some tough decisions on their part.

'Ultimately, what they are going to need is a firewall that sends a clear signal - we stand behind the European project, we stand behind the euro.'

The U.S. deployment to Australia is 
likely to add to China's concerns that Washington is trying to encircle 
it with bases in Japan and South Korea and now troops in Australia.

But Mr Obama stressed that China was not being isolated.

'The notion that we fear China is 
mistaken. The notion that we are looking to exclude China is mistaken,' 
he said, adding China was not being excluded from the planned 
Trans-Pacific Partnership (TTP) on trade.

'We welcome a rising, peaceful 
China,' he added before saying that the country's rising power means it 
must take on greater responsibilities to ensure free trade and security 
in the region.

'It's important for them to play by 
the rules of the road and, in fact, help underwrite the rules that have 
allowed so much remarkable economic progress,' he said.

The U.S. deployment to Australia, the
largest since World War Two, will start next year with a company of 
200-250 marines in Darwin, the 'Pearl Harbour of Australia', Mrs Gillard
said.

More bombs were dropped on Darwin during a surprise Japanese raid than on Pearl Harbour, Hawaii.

A total of 2,500 U.S. troops would 
eventually rotate through the port city. The United States will bring in
ships, aircraft and vehicles, as well as increase military training.

China has already expressed concern about the plan.

An
editorial in The Global Times, a government-controlled paper, warned 
that Australia could be 'caught in the crossfire' if it allowed the U.S.
to use its military bases to harm Chinese interests.

Mr Obama landed in Australia amid a security alert after it emerged documents indicating possible locations he could visit were left in view.

Documents detailing places that U.S. secret service agents had visited in order to check out possible locations the the Commander in Chief could visit while in the city were left on the front seat of an unmanned old van - visible to anyone who peered in.

There could have been major security problems if the papers had been viewed by terrorists who could have targeted the buildings should they have been chosen as places to visit by the President.

A team of local drivers employed by the U.S. secret service was asked to drop their time sheets, detailing schools and others buildings they had taken agents to, through the window of the van which was parked at the rear of a hotel.

One local driver claimed he was sacked for refusing to send timesheets - showing where a U.S. agent from the U.S Department of Homeland Security had been - unaccompanied in a taxi to the hotel car park where the papers were to be dropped through the van's window.

That particular time sheet detailed suburbs and buildings that the agent had visited last week, Sydney's Daily Telegraph reported.

The driver said the papers revealed various places the agent had visited to check them out on behalf of the President.

China stands for 'peaceful 
development and cooperation'. Foreign Ministry spokesman Liu Weimin said
when asked about the proposed deepening of military cooperation.

'We also believe that the external 
policies of countries in the region should develop along these lines,' 
Liu told a regular news briefing in Beijing.

Some Asian nations are likely to 
welcome the U.S. move as a counterbalance to China's growing military 
power, especially its expanding maritime operations, and a reassurance 
that Washington will not scale back its engagement in the region due to a
stretched U.S. military budget.

'The United States hopes to 
militarily strengthen alliance relations with Japan in the north and 
with Australia in the south, with the clear intention of 
counter-balancing China,' Su Hao, the director of the Asia-Pacific 
Researcher Centre at the Foreign Affairs University in Beijing, told the
Global Times, a popular Chinese newspaper.

The winding down of wars in 
Afghanistan and Iraq has opened the door to greater U.S. attention to 
simmering tension over the South China Sea, a shipping lane for more 
than $5 trillion in annual trade that the United States wants to keep 
open.

Obama plans to raise maritime 
security in the South China Sea at a regional summit on Bali this week, 
defying China's desire to keep the sensitive topic off the agenda.

China claims the entire maritime 
region, a vital commercial shipping route rich in oil, minerals and 
fishery resources. It insists that any disputes be resolved through 
bilateral talks and says Washington has no business getting involved.

Vietnam, the Philippines, Taiwan, 
Malaysia and Brunei hold rivals claims to at least parts of the sea and 
tension occasionally flares up into maritime stand-offs.

Obama will make an 'anchor speech' 
outlining the U.S. vision for the Asia-Pacific to the Australian 
parliament on Thursday before a whistle stop in Darwin. He then flies to
the Indonesian island of Bali for the East Asia summit.
