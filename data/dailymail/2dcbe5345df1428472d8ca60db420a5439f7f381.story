Tory MP Fiona Bruce is attempting to stop 'femicide' - the termination of pregnancies if the mother finds that she is expecting a girl

MPs will mount a bid tomorrow to make it a criminal offence to abort a child on the grounds of gender.

The move, being spearheaded by Tory MP Fiona Bruce, is an attempt to stop ‘femicide’ – the termination of pregnancies if the mother finds that she is expecting a girl.

Campaigners say that the practice is well established in some ethnic minority communities in the UK, where a greater value is traditionally placed on a male child.

Mrs Bruce has tabled an amendment to the Serious Crime Bill which would ‘put beyond doubt’ that it should be a prosecutable offence for a doctor in the UK to abort a baby on the basis of gender.

The MP, who claims wide cross-party support for the measure, says the reform is required because in 2012 the Crown Prosecution Service decided not to charge two doctors who were caught agreeing to abort female babies.

The then Director of Public Prosecutions, Keir Starmer, said the law did not ‘in terms, expressly prohibit gender-specific abortions’. Tomorrow’s debate will be a free vote, allowing MPs to ‘follow their consciences’ on the matter. When the issue was put to a non-binding vote last November it was passed by 181 votes to one.

In support of her move, Mrs Bruce points to university research which has found evidence of a shortage of girl babies in some ethnic minority communities. She says that women have come forward to say that they were kicked and punched repeatedly in the stomach by husbands trying to cause a miscarriage if they were carrying girl babies.

Last night, Mrs Bruce was backed by her Conservative colleague Nadine Dorries, who said: ‘In some cultures and religions, the birth of a girl child is a birth of shame. There are reports of women being coerced and forced with the threat of violence into aborting their daughters.

‘There are even stories of women too afraid to leave hospital and return home with a baby daughter.

The debate in the House of Commons will be a free vote, allowing MPs to ‘follow their consciences’ on the matter

‘Some of the mothers are victims of their own upbringing and they believe themselves, and any female child they bear, to be of less value than a male.’

Mrs Dorries added: ‘Labour-supporting websites, publications and prominent figures have this week been calling for MPs to vote the amendment down. But if the vote goes our way there will be young women everywhere who will have no idea that their life once hung in the balance.’

The amendment is also backed by Labour’s Indian-born Virendra Sharma, MP for Ealing Southall. He said that a ‘legal framework’ was needed to send a clear signal to those families where pressure is put on pregnant women to terminate according to gender.
