Great Britain completed a clean sweep of team event titles at the Canoe Slalom World Cup in Lee Valley with two more gold medals on the final day of competition on Sunday.

David Florence won his third gold of the weekend as he followed up his Saturday double in the C1 category by teaming up with Richard Hounslow to help win the C2 team title.

And the hosts also took victory in the women's K1 team event ensuring they finished top of the medals table with seven golds and a silver.

Florence and Hounslow missed their chance at further medals when they posted the fastest time in the C2 individual final only to be pushed down to fifth place due to penalties.

Florence said: 'It was frustrating to get those little touches but you can't afford to make those little mistakes.

'But we were very pleased with our time which was the fastest of the day. It's pretty pleasing for this stage of the season.'

GB Canoeing performance director John Anderson said the weekend results bode well for next year's slalom World Championships, which will be held at the same venue.

Anderson said: 'It was absolutely outstanding and the icing on the cake from a hugely successful weekend.

'In terms of legacy this is probably the best advert that there is from any London Olympic facility in the UK.

'We will be hosting the World Championships here next year and beyond that we need to make sure that year on year this is a venue on the circuit. Because what we saw yesterday was the benefit of home advantage.'

Focused: Florence and Hounslow were top form at Lee Valley just weeks before the Commonwealth Games
