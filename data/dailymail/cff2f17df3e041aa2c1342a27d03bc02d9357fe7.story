Bosnia said today that more than a quarter of its four million people had been affected by the worst floods to hit the Balkans in living memory.

Comparing the 'terrifying' destruction to that of the country's 1992-95 war, authorities said the extent of the devastation became apparent in neighbouring Serbia too.

As waters receded in some of the worst-hit areas it was revealed that homes had been toppled or submerged in mud, trees felled and villages strewn with the rotting corpses of livestock.

At least 35 people drowned after heavy rainfall since Thursday triggered floods in Bosnia-Herzegovina and Serbia, officials said

The regional death toll reached at least 39, after the heaviest rainfall since records began 120 years ago caused rivers to burst their banks and triggered hundreds of landslides.

'The consequences ... are terrifying,' Bosnian Foreign Minister Zlatko Lagumdzija told a news conference. 'The physical destruction is not less than the destruction caused by the war.'

Lagumdzija said more than 100,000 houses and other buildings in Bosnia were no longer fit to use and that over a million people had been cut off from clean water supplies.

'During the war, many people lost everything,' he said. 'Today, again they have nothing.'

His remarks threw into sharp relief the extent of the challenge now facing the cash-strapped governments of both Bosnia and Serbia.

Serbian Prime Minister Aleksandar Vucic said the cost in Serbia would run to hundreds of millions of euros, and that the death toll would certainly rise.

Even as the crisis eased in some areas, a new flood wave from the swollen River Sava threatened others, notably Serbia's largest power plant, the Nikola Tesla complex, 30 km (18 miles) southwest of the capital Belgrade.

In Bosnia, one official said as many as 500,000 people had been evacuated or left their homes, the kind of human displacement not seen since more than a million were driven out by ethnic cleansing in the Bosnian war two decades ago.

At least 25,000 people have been evacuated in Serbia, but many more are believed to have left of their own accord.

'We have some indications that a half a million Bosnians have either been evacuated or have left their homes because of flooding or landslides,' said Fahrudin Solak, the acting head of the civil defence service in Bosnia's autonomous Federation.

Serbian tennis star Novak Djokovic said the floods were of an 'epic, Biblical' scale.

'It has not been remembered in the last 150 years that we have had such a natural disaster,' he told Sky News.

'Our
 country depends on agriculture. There are many people who lost all 
their natural goods, an everything that was the mainstay of their 
income.'

Hundreds of volunteers in the Serbian capital filled sandbags and stacked them along the banks of the Sava. Police issued an appeal for more bags.

Soldiers and energy workers toiled through the night to build barriers of sandbags to keep the water back from the Nikola Tesla energy complex and from the coal-fired Kostolac power plant, east of Belgrade.

Djina Trisovic, a union spokeswoman at Serbia's EPS power utility, said some workers at the Nikola Tesla plant had worked three days with barely a break because relief teams could not reach the plant.

'The plant should be safe now,' she told Reuters. 'We've done all we could. Now it's in the hands of God.'

The plant provides roughly half of Serbia's electricity. Parts of it had already been shut down as a precaution, but it would have to be powered down completely if the waters breached the defences.

Flooding had already caused considerable damage, estimated by the government at over 100 million euros ($140 million), to the Kolubara coal mine that supplies the plant.

Authorities in Bosnia issued a fresh warning about the danger of landmines left over from the war and now dislodged by the flooding.

In the north Bosnian region of Maglaj, barely a single house was left untouched by the waters, which receded to leave a tide of mud and debris.

In the village of Donja Polja, where Muslim Bosniaks returned in 1995 to homes burned or shelled during the war, Hatidza Muhic swept the mud from the hallway of her house. Dark lines on the walls indicated the water had reached some three metres high.

'I thought the war was as bad as it can get, but it can get worse,' Muhic said. 'I just pray to God that we can save our minds, because first we were hit by the war, and now this.'
