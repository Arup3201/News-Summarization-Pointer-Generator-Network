Michael Gove was unrepentant yesterday about his decision to axe the Labour-supporting head of the schools watchdog.

The move not to renew Baroness Morgan’s contract as head of Ofsted has prompted a fierce Coalition row over appointments to top jobs.

The Education Secretary insisted the decision to sack the former close aide to Tony Blair was not based on politics but because he wanted a ‘new perspective’.

However, he refused to rule out the appointment of a former Conservative donor and private equity boss as her replacement. Privately, Tories said that criticism over making political appointments to public bodies was misplaced.

Some pointed to the record of Tony Blair and Gordon Brown on handing out posts to sympathetic figures. Many New Labour appointees still hold influential positions in quangos, the NHS and other public bodies.

Meanwhile, David Cameron has given jobs to a string of Labour figures, including making former minister Alan Milburn, a social mobility tsar.

One senior Tory said: ‘The truth is, our record on this is pretty hopeless. We’ve been criticised by own side for giving positions to people affiliated with other parties. So this attack on us over Sally Morgan is pretty absurd.’

The baroness, whose contract expires 
this year, has protested: ‘I really do think that it’s just I am the 
latest of a fairly long list of people now who are non-Conservative 
supporters who are not being re-appointed.’

The
 decision not to retain her as chairman for another three years has been
 heavily criticised by Mr Gove’s Liberal Democrat deputy David Laws.

Labour outrage over the sacking of Lady  Morgan contrasts with their string of appointments to public bodies. They include:

Party sources said he was ‘absolutely furious’ at what he saw as ‘blatant attempts to politicise Ofsted’.

There
 has been speculation Mr Gove wants to install Theodore Agnew at Ofsted.
 He is chairman of the Department for Education’s academies board and 
has given £144,000 to the Tories.

But one Lib Dem insider said they would ‘absolutely not’ countenance his appointment.

A Conservative source in Downing Street accused Mr Laws of stoking up the row in an attempt to distance his party from Mr Gove’s agenda.

In John Major’s last year in office, 
57 per cent of those appointed to a public post who  had a known 
political allegiance were Conservatives, with 32 per cent associated 
with Labour.

A year after 
Mr Blair came to power in 1997, the percentage of Labour appointees was 
up to 75 per cent and the Tory share down to 13 per cent

.Under Mr Cameron, 77 per cent of those 
with political backgrounds taken on to public bodies were allied to 
Labour, with the Tory figure at 14 per cent.

Conservative MEP Daniel Hannan said: ‘Labour grandees regard quango appointments as theirs by right: hence their genuine bewilderment and petulance when they lose one.’

On the BBC’s Andrew Marr programme, Mr Gove was asked if Mr Agnew was in the running to replace Baroness Morgan,

He said an independent panel would take charge of the decision, but added the new Ofsted chief will be chosen ‘on merit’.

He added: ‘There is nothing wrong with Sally. She is Labour, but let me be clear – this  Government is perfectly happy to appoint people whatever their political backgrounds.’

Official sources said there was ‘no great falling out’ but cast doubt on Lady Morgan’s willingness to drive through changes.

Deputy Lib Dem leader Sir Malcolm Bruce criticised Mr Gove for failing to consult his deputy Mr Laws.

He told Radio 5 Live: ‘They are trying to politicise something that should be kept outside of politics. You want people who are objective and professional.’
