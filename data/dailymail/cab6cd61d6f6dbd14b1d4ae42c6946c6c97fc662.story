For five years she had been an ordinary single mother, bringing up her young son in a quiet suburb of an American city.

But today justice finally caught up with Rasema Handanovic as she was jailed for five-and-a-half years for the war crimes she committed two decades ago at the height of the Bosnian conflict.

The 39-year-old, who is a US citizen, admitted killing six Bosnian Croats during an attack on the southern village of Trusina in April, 1993.

The court had heard how she was a member
of the Bosnian army’s feared special unit, the Zulfikar, which killed 
with impunity during the conflict.

Handanovic had shot a woman and an elderly couple dead. She was also accused of joining a firing-squad execution of unarmed Croatian soldiers and civilians on the same day.

A total of 18 Croat civilians and four prisoners of war, were killed during the attack on April 16 1993.

Judge Jasmina Kosovic,sitting in Sarajevo,  said Handanovic had been the victim of a wartime rape before committing the Trusina crimes and had lost several family members in the conflict. 

 Handanovic was sentenced to 
five-and-a-half years in prison, after she struck a plea bargain and 
agreed to testify against six other members of the Zulfikar special unit
of the Bosnian army which carried out the attack.

Civil
war among Bosnia's three main groups - Muslims, Serbs and Croats - 
broke out in 1992 and lasted until 1995, killing 260,000 people and 
driving 1.8 million from their homes.

Muslims
and Croats were allied against the Serbs at the start of the war, but 
they became enemies when Croat forces sought to capture territory held 
by the Bosnian army.

War crimes trials have been occurring since the end of the war.

The
worst atrocity was Bosnian Serbs' slaughter of 7,500 Muslims in 
Srebrenica in July 1995. The killings galvanised international will to 
end the war.

The 
testimony from combatants differs somewhat, but the underlying 
narrative, included in the prosecution's file on Handanovic, is 
consistent.

According 
to it, Handanovic's unit rounded up a group of Croat residents and, 
along with three captured soldiers from the Croatian military, bound and
shot them, the combatants said.

As
they lay dying, she 'shot into the heads of two or three (Croat) 
soldiers who were lying on the ground and showing signs of life,' a 
combatant testified.

'She might have shot more of them, but I cannot remember now.'

'The court has taken into account that
Handanovic admitted the crimes, was willing to provide all information 
and evidence related to the attack and the fact that she expressed 
remorse to the relatives of the victims,' Kosovic told the court. 

Handanovic, whose parents live in the US, is the first woman to be jailed for slaughtering civilians during the Bosnian War.

She was arrested in Portland, Oregon, 
at the home she shared with her son, last year at the request 
of the Bosnia and Herzegovia government.

They also arrested her accomplice Edin Dzeko, 39, in Everett, Washington.

Dzeko allegedly threw a man into the 
yard of a house, then shot and killed him. When the dead man's wife 
would not stop grieving, Dzeko allegedly shot her in the head and killed
her.

At the time of Handanovic's arrest, neighbours spoke of their disbelief at the allegations. 

Speaking to katu.com, neighbour Ella Wilvorn said the arrest had been a complete surprise.

'That totally dumbfounds me,' she said. 'I can't even imagine it.'

Another, who did not give her name, described the Bosnian Muslim as 'direct' but not violent and 'very calm'.

Handanovic became a U.S. citizen in 2006 having come to America in 2001. She had lived in Portland since 2003.

The killings occurred during the 1993-94 war between Bosnian Muslims and Croats.

After a truce was brokered a Bosnian state war crimes court was set up in 2005 to try the thousands of war crimes suspects.

The only other woman to have been 
convicted of war crimes during the Bosnian war was Biljana Plavsic, the 
former Bosnian Serb president who was found guilty of persecution and 
crimes against humanity by the Hague-based war crimes tribunal for the 
former Yugoslavia.        

Plavsic was sentenced in 2003 to 11 years in jail and released after serving two-thirds of her term.
