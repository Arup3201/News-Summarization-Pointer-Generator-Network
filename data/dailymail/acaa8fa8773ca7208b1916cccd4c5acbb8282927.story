A controversial dating website reserved for aesthetically pleasing singletons caused a stir when it launched back in 2009.

Describing its goal as creating a 'worldwide community of beauty', beautifulpeople.com allowed only attractive people to join and rebuffed anyone they didn't deem worthy.

And now the same brand, whose headquarters are in Denmark and New York, is taking its exclusivity one step further, launching a service for employers looking to recruit only the most physically 'attractive' employees.

Ugly need not apply: Beatifulpeople.com, a dating site for 'attractive' people to meet each other, has launched a recruitment site with the same rules

The company told Mashable it is launching a free recruitment service allowing companies to source potential employees from its roster of 750,000 'attractive' members.

The new site's tagline is 'an attractive face is always a great first impression for any business'.

It continues: 'With unemployment at record levels in North America, the UK and Europe, BeautifulPeople has launched a jobs listing service exclusively for members of BeautifulPeople.

'Browse the positions available which will be regularly updated. If you see something for you, simply use the contact information to submit your application.'

Greg Hodge, managing director of beautifulpeople.com, said: 'An honest employer will tell you that it pays to hire good-looking staff.

'Attractive people tend to make a better first impression on clients, win more business and earn more.'

However, Hodge added: 'This isn't an invitation for crackpots to come and ogle our beautiful members.'
