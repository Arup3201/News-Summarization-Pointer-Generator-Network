The 12-year-old boy was given first aid, then transported to Alice Springs Hospital. Paramedics and medical staff attended to the boy, but he died soon after.

Northern Territory Police superintendent Bob Harrison said 'We received information from a security guard that they'd spotted about eight young people sniffing cans near the hill,' Superintendent Harrison said.

'Unfortunately without pre-empting the coroner's findings and the autopsy we believe this contributed to the death of this 12-year-old.'

Supt Harrisson said he could not recall any other sniffing deaths in the Northern Territory, despite deodorant inhalation being prominent in central Australia.

Most retailers restrict the sale of inhalable sprays in Alice Springs, with Coles ordering a display cabinet which will restrict access to aerosols.
