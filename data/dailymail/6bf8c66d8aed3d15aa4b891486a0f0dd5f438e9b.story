Judge Philip Wassall said viewing online porn gave the boy, now 16, a 'skewed' view of women and helped turn him into a predator

A schoolboy turned into a vicious sexual predator after getting hooked on hardcore online pornography when he was just 12 years old, a court has heard.

The boy, now 16, sexually abused one girl aged 11, another aged 13, and went on to bully a 12-year-old into sending him explicit pictures of herself via Facebook.

Judge Philip Wassall, at Exeter Crown Court, was told the boy's attacks started after he began watching porn on the family computer at his North Devon home.

Mr Wassall said the disturbing images, which were viewed before the boy hit puberty, had warped his understanding of women and sex, and turned him into a predator.

Mr David Sapiecha, prosecuting, said the boy committed his first offence aged 12 after viewing pornography during a troubled period for his family.

He assaulted an 11-year-old after forcing  his hands down her trousers and touching her.

Despite the girl's protests the boy convinced himself she wanted him to do it, and told friends afterwards that she was 'begging for it', Mr Sapiecha said.

Aged 14 he attacked a 13-year-old girl after getting her drunk on a camping trip, and used Facebook to pressure another 12-year-old into sending him explicit pictures of herself.

She initially refused, but after he accused her of being frigid she agreed to pose in her underwear. 

However he kept pressuring her into sending more and more explicit images of herself with a deodorant can.

The court heard that all of the girls had been left emotionally devastated after the attacks, with one woman describing her daughter as 'an emotional wreck'.

Another of his victims began self harming after she was teased at school and called a 'slag'. 

Mr Wassall sentenced the boy to a two-year long series of classes to adjust his sexist attitude to women, and banned him from accessing pornography under a Sexual Offences Prevention Order.

The order means he is banned from visiting explicit sites, and is also banned from deleting his internet history.

Officers are allowed to examine his computer at any time, and if they find information is missing he can be taken back to court. The maximum penalty for a breach is five years in jail.

Mr Wassall said: 'What shines through in this case is that at the age of 12 you gained access to pornography, before you committed these offences, and it was at that time your difficulties began.

'When one thinks of the impact of that on a 12-year-old mind and on someone in a vulnerable position, it really makes one uncomfortably aware just how easy it is to access pornography, even for somebody very young.

The boy is now banned from explicit websites, cannot delete his internet history, and must consent to police searches of his computer

'Unless anybody has knowledge of what is happening, it is very difficult to do something about it. I take note of the fact the Government is engaging with internet service providers and this case highlights the need for that.

'Every day people are accessing mainstream pornography which can have a detrimental effect on children and young people.

'The Youth Offending Team’s report concludes this offending started very shortly after you started watching this material at a time before puberty.

'It is very likely to have led to a skewed attitude towards women when you went through puberty and it is difficult to avoid the conclusion it formed the background to this offending.

'Having said that, it was serious sexual offending which has been very damaging for the victims who have not only suffered directly but through online bullying by people who know you.

'None of the victims did anything to encourage you and you imposed your will on them. They are completely innocent victims.'

He told the boy he expects him to work with probation 'to deal with the background of this offending and ensure your relationships with women in the future are healthy and responsible.' 

Emily Pitts, defending, said the offences happened at a troubled time and when he was aged 12 to 14. He has stayed out of trouble for more than a year since being arrested.

She said he has devoted himself to positive community activities and has since won awards for his charity fund raising.
