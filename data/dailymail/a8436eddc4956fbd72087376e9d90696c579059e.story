A historically important letter from 
Oskar Schindler is among documents to be sold at New 
Hampshire auction house.

The German industrialist's efforts to save Jews 
from the Holocaust were made famous in the 1993 Oscar-winning film 
'Schindler's List'.

The one-page letter signed by 
Schindler was sent from his enamelware factory in Krakow, Poland, where 
he employed more than 1,000 Jewish workers from a nearby Nazi 
concentration camp.

Historical: The letter was sent on behalf of one of Schindler's employees, Adam Dziedzic, who had 'received a clearings contract for unloading and assembling war-necessary machinery

The letter, written in German and 
dated Aug. 22, 1944, was sent on behalf of one of Schindler's employees,
Adam Dziedzic, who had 'received a clearings contract for unloading and
assembling war-necessary machinery and has been sent to Sudetengau.'

Through bribery and personal connections, Schindler got 
permission to produce arms and move the factory and its workers to 
Brunnlitz, in Sudetenland, or Sudetengau, in what is now Czech Republic.

Schindler had been tipped off in the 
summer of 1944 that the Nazis planned to close factories unrelated to 
the war effort. 

Holocaust 
historian and Schindler biographer David Crowe said: 'This is the first document I have 
seen verifying this move and it is quite important because I thought it 
took him much longer to get such permission.

'Most importantly, if Oskar had not gotten such permission, there would have been no Schindler's List.'

Schindler saved lives during World War
Two by employing Jews in munitions and other factories he owned.

The 
nine or 10 lists of employees he submitted to the Nazis became known 
collectively as 'Schindler's list.'

The documents also include a medical 
transfer document that underscores Dziedzic's importance to Schindler 
and plans for part of Schindler's Krakow munitions factory, the auction 
house said.

Behind the new building were living quarters for Jewish 
workers that served as a safe haven from the nearby Plaszow 
concentration camp, it said.

'We've never seen a war-dated 
Schindler document,' said Livingston, the auction house vice president.

'It's exceptionally rare, and something of this importance we just never
get.'

The quiet savior: Oskar Schindler saving a thousand Jews from the Holocaust only became widely known because of a book and a movie about his actions

The auction ends Aug. 14. By Wednesday afternoon, online bids had reached nearly $21,000.

'Schindler's List' went on sale for $3million last month but failed to get any bids at all.

The auction closed on eBay after being up for sale for one week.

The document, which was being sold by a private owner in Israel and was only available
for local pick up, is the only copy of the list ever to be sold on the open market.

The list is dated April 8, 1945, and has 801 male names on it.

David Crowe, a Holocaust historian and
the author of the book, 'Oskar Schindler: The Untold Account of His 
Life, Wartime Activities, and the True Story Behind the List,' said
the date of the list may be one reason it did not receive any bids.

The film was based on the first two 
lists ever created, which were from the fall of 1944 - which were called
'The Lists of Life'.

Any lists that came after, including this one, were merely
updates of the original, he said.

Crowe said any update of that would not be worth even close to $3million.

'When they say "Schindler's list", 
it's almost like they are using the romance of the original list and the
magic of that to sell what was prepared at the end of the war. This 
list is far less valuable.

'This is not fraudulent,' he said of the effort to place the list on 
eBay. 'They certainly do tell the end of the the story, but they don't 
illuminate the beginning, so they are less important.'

Amid rumors the list wasn't the original, Crowe said even if it was, it still wouldn't be worth $3million.

Seller Eric Gazin, the president of Gazin auctions, said he has no plans to reduce the price.

'The value and price of noted 
historical documents has been rising the past two years as investors 
realize their significance and investment value,' he said. 'It's a fair 
price given its history and its provenance.'

For sale: Collectors have put an original copy of 'Schindler's List' up for auction on eBay

Calling the document ‘a piece of history that has inspired many', the listing
by auction promoters Gazin and Gary Zimet guaranteed the list’s authenticity – it was sourced 
from Itzhak Stern, Schindler’s accountant played by Ben Kingsley in the 
award-winning film.

The document can only be collected in Israel 'for security' and to give the
winning bidder the opportunity to personally inspect it, Garvin told MailOnline

Gazin and Zimet
are collectors from California with a history of headline-grabbing 
auctions through their company Auction Cause. They were hoping for the 
document to sell for millions beyond the reserve price.

The two chose ‘the 
world’s marketplace’ because there are billionaires and
wealthy celebrities using the site, Garvin told the New York Post.

‘Using
eBay offers the widest audience and the most opportunity to bid, as 
opposed to a traditional auction house,’ Garvin told MailOnline before the item went on sale.

The other three known
copies are in museums – with two in Israel and one in the United States
Holocaust Museum – and that is where many believe this copy should also
go.

Several Twitter users expressed unhappiness with the auction. One person even tweeted ‘if you’re still wondering about the world you live in...Schindler’s list is being sold on e-bay [SIC]. Say no more.’

Explaining that he understands why people believe the list belongs on display in a museum instead of for sale online, Garvin said that many people with collections of ‘fantastic items’ choose to share those items with a greater audience.

‘It would not surprise me if it ends up in a museum… I think that would be fantastic,’ said Garvin.

The list originated from German 
Industrialist Oskar Schindler. During World War II, Schindler made it 
his mission to keep his Jewish employees from oppression and death at 
the hands of the Nazis.

Schindler even bribed officials with cash and lavish gifts to keep them away.

Over six million Jews were persecuted, tortured and murdered at concentration camps across Europe as part of the 'Final Solution' by the Nazi regime by the end of World War II, according to the United States Memorial Holocaust Museum, with victims included Gypsies, the disabled, Poles, Russians and others. The dead ranged in age from babies to the elderly.

His
efforts were adopted into both a book and movie, the latter of which 
starred Liam Neeson and won seven Academy Awards, including best picture
and a best actor nod for Neeson.

Previous auctions staged by Auction Cause include a date with Scarlett Johansson – the
$19 million reserve was not met, a selling of the Harry Reid/Rush 
Limbaugh letter which fetched $2.1 million and a $200,000 David and 
Victoria Beckham cocktail reception.
