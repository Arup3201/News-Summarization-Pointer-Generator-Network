Cover-ups: Disgraced pastor A.B. Schirmer, of Pennsylvania, has now been charged with the murder of both his wives

A former pastor facing trial for his second wife's murder has now been charged in the death of his first wife after a grand jury concluded that he killed both women with blunt objects.

Arthur Burton 'A.B.' Schirmer, 63, was charged with homicide in the death of Jewel Schirmer, his wife of more than 30 years, Lebanon County District Attorney David Arnold announced today.

Schirmer's attorney said his client, the former pastor of Reeders United Methodist Church in Jackson Township, Pennsylvania, denies involvement in either of his wives' deaths.

Jewel Schirmer, 50, died at Hershey Medical Center of a traumatic brain injury from an alleged fall down a flight of stairs.

Schirmer said he came home on April 23, 
1999, to find Jewel lying at the bottom of some steps and bleeding from 
the head. She died the next day.

Police
and prosecutors reopened the probe after her husband came under 
investigation in the 2008 death of his second wife, Betty, in the Pocono
Mountains.

Schirmer was 
charged two years ago with killing Betty and staging a car accident to 
cover it up.

He's scheduled to stand trial in that case in January.

In the death of his second wife, he said he was driving Betty to Pocono 
Medical Center on July 15, 2008, when she awoke complaining of jaw pain 
and she had removed her seat belt to get comfortable.

He claimed a deer ran into the road and he swerved to avoid it, crashing
into the guide rail and causing Betty to hit her head against the 
windshield

Police later said the damage to the 
car was too minor to have caused an injury that produced as much blood 
as paramedics found in the car.

Questions: Schirmer's first wife Jewel (left) died in 1999 after an alleged fall down the stairs while Betty died in a car crash which the disgraced pastor allegedly staged two years ago

In cuffs: Schirmer denies having anything to do with either of his wives' deaths. He is due to stand trial in January

A Lebanon County grand jury cited medical testimony that revealed Schirmer used blunt objects to kill both his wives.

'We
find it particularly disturbing and difficult to believe that both of 
A.B. Schirmer's wives could have suffered such horrific injuries by 
accident.

'To the contrary,
we believe probable cause exists to believe that neither woman died 
from an accident,' said the grand jury's report, released on Friday.

Arnold declined to speculate on a 
motive, but the grand jury report indicates that Schirmer was unfaithful
to Jewel throughout their marriage, carrying on affairs with women in 
the church.

The grand jury also said the Schirmers had financial difficulties.

Hypocrite: Schirmer cheated on his first wife Jewel throughout their marriage, police claimed, with women in his congregation at Reeders United Methodist Church in Jackson Township, Pennsylvania

'I'm happy. I've been waiting 13 years for this day to come. It's time for justice,' said Jewel's brother, John Behney, appearing at a news conference with DA Arnold.

Schirmer's attorney, James Swetz, said his client will be vindicated.

'Our belief, and what we intend to show in both of these incidents, is that the initial reports were correct, that the Monroe County death was an accident and in Lebanon County, there was evidence of heart attack' preceding her fall, Swetz said.

Vindicated: DA Dave Arnold, right, announced that Schirmer had been charged in the 1999 death of his first wife. Jewel Schirmer's brother, John Behney, pictured alongside, said he had waited 13 years for this day
