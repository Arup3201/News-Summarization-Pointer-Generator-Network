Today show host Savannah Guthrie will begin her maternity leave after filming her last segment on Monday.

The bubbly 42-year-star, who is around one week away from her due date, announced the news this morning live on air dressed in a bump-hugging black dress and practical flat shoes.

'Monday's going to be my last day. I'm going to go on maternity leave after Monday. I'm excited!' she proclaimed amid warm applause from her co-hosts, before quipping: 'You know it's a universal sign to go when none of your shoes fit because your cankles are so large.'

Gleeful: With her due date just around the corner, Savannah Guthrie (pictured) announced live on the Today show this morning, 'I'm going to go on maternity leave after Monday. I'm excited!'

Yesterday, the anchor tweeted to her 296,000 followers: 'Won't you take me to cankletown #pregnancy', and this morning she fueled speculation as to the sex of the baby, which she and husband Mike Feldman, 45, have chosen not to find out ahead of the birth.

'We don't know our baby's gender - do you?? Twitterverse, you're on: is it #SavannahBOY or #SavannahGIRL???' she tweeted, following up with: 'Will miss y'all. Last day Monday! RT @TODAYshow: @SavannahGuthrie announced maternity leave on air this am.'

NBC has not revealed who will fill in for Savannah while she is away learning the ropes of first time motherhood. In May, NBC News president Deborah Turness said in a statement to The New York Times: 'Savannah has been such a big part of the Today show’s momentum over the last few months.

'While 
she’s with her newborn we’ll keep that momentum going with our own 
homegrown talent with perhaps a few surprises mixed in.'

Last week, footage of Savannah's emotional baby shower was released and viewers were treated to a rundown of her heartfelt speech to guests.

'I have never felt in my life so much genuine joy,' she said, choking back tears.

'When you say that you're happy for us and you give us a hug or you rub the belly, I know you really mean it. That means so much to me and to us.'

Relaxing into it: Last month, Savannah, pictured June 20 (left) and June 17 (right), wrote on her blog, 'Glory in the elastic waistband. There is no point in sucking in your stomach'

She's come a long way: Savannah, pictured early into her pregnancy (left) and last September (right), recently wrote, 'I whisper little encouragements to the baby, "You're doing a great job growing up!"'

Savannah has been a sharing intimate details of her journey with viewers on air and via her Today.com blog since she first announced her surprise pregnancy in March; and has gladly relaxed into her growing size of late.

Last month, she finally ditched the heels and appeared on her live segment wearing sneakers. 'Unbutton those jeans and glory in the elastic waistband,' she wrote on her blog. 'There is no point in sucking in your stomach, or squeezing into a dress, or trying to look good in a bathing suit.'

'The baby is the first thought when I wake up, and the last thought as I sink into slumber at night'

Opening up about the sacred connection she has with her unborn child, following a long struggle with fertility issues leading up to it, she wrote in May: 'The baby is the first thought when I wake up, and the last thought as I sink into slumber at night. I whisper little encouragements to the baby: "You’re doing a great job growing up!" or "I’m so happy you’re here!"

'I pray for the baby. I sing to him/her. I wonder about the baby constantly: "What are you up to? Are you sleeping right now? Are you awake? How do you feel about the Indian food we had for dinner?"'

Co-host Natalie Morales assured Savannah this morning that the team had 'lots of special surprises' planned for her last day on Monday.
