Sheffield United fans chanted their support for Ched Evans yesterday after he was released from prison having served half his sentence for rape.

Some sections of the United supporters chanted: ‘Super Ched, Super Ched. He can do what he wants’ as the League One team visited Bradford.

The fans’ show of support follows reports Evans was to be offered a two-year £500,000 contract by his former club – although United insist they have made no such decision.

Judy Finnigan’s comments on Evans’s case led to the trolling of her daughter Chloe.

Sky Sports News presenter Charlie Webster said she would quit her role as a ‘patron’ of Sheffield United if the club were to re-sign Evans. 

Webster told Radio 5 Live: ‘You will have young people cheering him on when he scores a goal. Not under my name.’

West Ham vice-chairman and Apprentice star Karren Brady agreed, saying there is ‘no place anywhere in football’ for Evans.

Former Welsh international Evans, 25, was released last week after serving half of a five-year sentence for raping a 19-year-old woman.

Following the abuse of Chloe Madeley at the hands of internet trolls - many thought to be fans of the footballer - the Justice Secretary announced a change in sentencing which quadruples the maximum penalty for offenders.

Chris Grayling today revealed trolls could face up to two years, describing offenders as 'cowards poisoning our national life'.  

Since his conviction the footballer has denied raping the 19-year-old waitress he had sex with in a budget hotel in his hometown Rhyl. 

He was released from prison this week at 5am, collected by a chauffeured Range Rover.
