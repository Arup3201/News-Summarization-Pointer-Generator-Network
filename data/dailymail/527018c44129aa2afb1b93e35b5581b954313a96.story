World Rally Championship winner Sebastien Ogier recorded his eighth victory of the year at the season-ending Wales Rally GB on Sunday.

The Frenchman had taken control of the three-day event from the start, as the Volkswagen Polo R driver secured first place with a margin of 37.6 seconds ahead of Mikko Hirvonen, who was competing in his final rally before retirement.

Kris Meeke of Northern Ireland had looked set for a challenge, but skidded into a ditch on Sunday morning, which resulted in damaged tyres to his Citroen DS3 and he slipped down to sixth place.

Mads Ostberg moved up to claim third place for Citroen, the Norwegian finishing some 26secs behind Hirvonen’s Fiesta RS. Welshman Elfyn Evans claimed fifth.

Ogier said on www.wrc.com: 'It is the best way to finish the season and it was my target.

'We started flat-out on Friday and made an incredible day - there was a big difference to everyone else.”

An error from Jari-Matti Latvala during tough conditions on Friday’s opening leg had put him into a ditch and lost three minutes as a result to push Ogier back in overall command of the rally.

'My rally changed when Jari-Matti made a mistake and I had control and could ease my pace,' added Ogier.

'It wasn’t the most fun way to drive, but in the slippery conditions I had to do it. It was the best way to get the win.'

Hirvonen admitted it was an emotional finale.

He said: 'I couldn’t have planned a better way to end my career. It was a fantastic fight all weekend, one of the most enjoyable from the last 13 years.'
