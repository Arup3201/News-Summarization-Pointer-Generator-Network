Jailed: Leopold McLean, 49, shot his girlfriend's ex-boyfriend outside her home in November 2010

Mayor Bloomberg's bodyguard has been jailed for seven years for attempted murder in a love triangle shooting.

Leopold McLean, 49, shot his girlfriend's ex-boyfriend outside her home in November 2010.

The shooting took place after the veteran NYPD officer had dropped off Mayor Bloomberg’s daughter Georgina at home after a Knicks game.

McLean spotted LePaul Gammons outside his girlfriend Assia Winfield’s Jamaica, Queens home.

He shot him twice in the buttocks and back using his service weapon as Gammons  ran away .

McLean and Winfield called 911, claiming Gammons had broken into her house and had a knife.

But the detective failed to mention that he had fired at Gammons, reported the New York Post.

Gammons was violating a protection order the night he showed up at Winfield’s home.

During the trial, Winfield said that while she was dating McLean, she filed complaints against Gammons.

She
 also admitted that she still continued to call him, visited him in jail
 and accepted two cars he bought for her adult daughter.

McLean was just two months short of getting his pension following a 19-year police career. 

Gammons is currently imprisoned at Rikers Island for a forgery conviction.

'Common sense would have told you to 
take Assia Winfield into her house, call police, tell them what 
happened, what Gammons looked like, what direction he went in, that he 
was armed with a knife, and all vital information for your fellow 
officers,' Queens Supreme Court Justice James Griffin told the former 
cop.

'You suffer more than most defendants. Your career as an officer is over.'
