The Italian football federation has charged Roma and its coach Rudi Garcia after the Frenchman used a mobile phone to communicate with his assistant during a match more than a year ago.

Garcia used the phone to communicate with his assistant Frederic Bompard in the stands, something that is legal in Ligue 1 but banned in the Italian league.

On Thursday the FIGC said it has deferred Garcia and Bompard to its disciplinary commission 'for using electronic systems of communication between them.' Roma has also been charged for the incident, which happened in Garcia's Serie A debut, against Livorno.

Roma director Mauro Baldissoni says 'Roma asked via a letter for explanations of the ruled from the Referees' Association, FIGC, Lega Serie A and Disciplinary Commission. 

'As of today, nobody has given us a reply.'
