Many cat owners would proudly boast that their pet is house-trained.

But Bella has gone one step further - and learned to spend a penny on the toilet.

The tortoiseshell pet was taken in as a stray by Paul Lloyd, 30, and became so attached she followed him everywhere - even the loo.

And to his amazement Bella started leaping up onto the open toilet bowl and carefully peeing over the edge into the water.

Bella followed her owners everywhere and picked up a few human traits on the way including using the toilet

Mr Lloyd said: 'I think she just sort of picked it up while we were doing it.

'She
would always follow us into the bathroom, there was nothing we could do
to get her out, she would just sit on the bath as we did our thing.

'Then one day I heard this noise coming from the bathroom and when we went to investigate she was just using the toilet.

'She’s been doing for four or five months now, she won’t go anywhere else, she walks in, does her thing and then leaves.

'We didn’t teach her, although I wish we could teach her to flush the toilet afterwards!'

It is reminiscent of the big-screen comedy Meet The Parents starring Robert De Niro, in which the family cat, Mr Jinx, could use the lavatory - although he could flush in the film.

Bella turned up on the doorstep of Mr Lloyd and his partner Pamela Knowles, 32, in Horwich, Bolton, two years ago.

The malnourished pet was micro-chipped but when the couple traced her owner they had moved away.

Bella
has also started picking up other human traits such as cuddling up 
under the duvet with her head on the pillow and sitting on a chair like 
her owners.

'She’s our baby,' added Mr Lloyd, a PR and marketing manager. 'We wouldn’t have her any other way.

'It’s a little strange for sure, but it saves us money on cat litter!'

When they rescued her, Bella was malnourished but she has been nursed back to normal weight
