They went out of their way not to be photographed with each other at the society wedding of the year on Saturday.

But Prince Harry and Cressida Bonas were very much together as they returned to London on Sunday.

The pair, who have been dating for almost a year, arrived by train at Kings Cross and, escorted by two Scotland Yard bodyguards, made their way to a waiting Range Rover which headed off in the direction of Kensington Palace.

Casual: Prince Harry arriving at King Cross Station with girlfriend Cressida Bonas after spending the weekend in Northumberland

Laid back journey: Cressida, 24, was dressed in comfortable blue trousers with a weekend bag slung over her shoulder, while Prince Harry, 28, appeared to be carrying a suit

Royal carriage: Cressida and Harry were aboard the East Coast service from Alnmouth to London's Kings Cross on Sunday

Not alone: The couple were quickly escorted off the train by security guards and into a waiting Range Rover

Both Harry, 28, and his 24-yearold girlfriend were dressed for comfort not style.

The third-in-line-to-the-throne was sporting a checked shirt open at the neck to display an African leather thong-style necklace, jeans, suede desert boots and a baseball cap.

His girlfriend, pretty upper-class dance student Cressida, who at 24 is four years younger than the prince, was even more dressed down in slouchy ‘boyfriend’ jeans - so called because they look like they could have been borrowed from your partner.

Her oversized grey wool jumper appeared to have been pinched from Harry as well, the sleeves hanging loosely over her wrists, while on her feet were hi-top white trainers.

It certainly wasn’t the kind of outfit you would expect even an off-duty Duchess of Cambridge to be seen in. 

The day before: Prince Harry and Cressida Bonas all dressed up for the Saturday wedding

No secret: The couple have been dating for almost a year and were spotted kissing on a ski slope in the Alps earlier this year

Morning after: The couple were returning to London after attending the wedding of Lady Melissa Percy and Thomas Van Straubenzee who married at Alnwick castle on the weekend

But despite not wearing any make-up and with her long blonde hair unkempt, Cressida was still, clearly, naturally beautiful.

The couple had attended the wedding of royal confidante Thomas van Straubenzee and the Duke of Northumberland’s daughter, Lady Melissa Percy, on Saturday, although they had taken pains not be to photographed together.

The celebration, was also attended by Prince William but not his heavily pregnant wife, the Duchess of Cambridge, Also present as a joint maid of honour was Chelsy Davy, the bride’s best friend, who also happens to be Prince Harry’s former long-term girlfriend.

The pair split for good in 2011, shortly after Chelsy accompanied him to the royal wedding, after an often tempestuous seven year, on-off relationship.

If it was a difficult experience for Cressida, who like Chelsy went to Stowe public school followed by Leeds University, then the confident young beauty wasn’t telling.

Jolly ride: The couple travelled back in a First Class carriage with several other wedding guests

Royal protection: The couple were escorted from the station to their car by two body guards

One direction: Cressida looks anxiously at Harry as they leave Kings Cross station to take a car which left in the direction of Prince Harry's flat at Kensington Palace

Perfect match: Friends close to Harry have said that the Prince is 'very keen' on his girlfriend of 12-months

‘It would have been uncharacteristic of Cressida to be intimidated by anyone at all,’ a friend said.

The source stressed that Cressida was still young, adding: ‘She and Harry are very fond of each other and taking things one step at a time to see whether or not there might be something more permanent one day.’

Cressida, whose best friend is Princess Eugenie, is a familiar figure on London’s social scene and is said by the those who know her as ‘bubbly and terribly, terribly sweet’.

The couple arrived back from Alnwick Castle at King Cross Station on a 4.45pm East Coast train yesterday accompanied in a First Class carriage by a gaggle of other guests including Tara Palmer-Tomkinson and Viscount Jules Erleigh, heir to the Marquess of Reading, who is one of Harry’s great mates.

True gentleman: The 28 year old royal stepped in as a knight in shining armour and helped his lady in distress with her bag

On the lookout: Prince Harry looks over his shoulder as his girlfriend gets in the car

Alighting on the platform, the couple peeled off from the rest of the group and headed, accompanied by two Scotland Yard bodyguards, towards a waiting Range Rover driven by another member of the security team.

Ever the gentleman, Harry helped Cressida to load her bag into the waiting car before they hopped in together and headed off the in the direction of Kensington Palace, where the prince has an apartment.

Well-placed sources say the prince, who has just completed a stint in Afghanistan as an Apache helicopter pilot and is continuing his training with the Army Air Corps, said he seems ‘incredibly keen’ on Cressida, with whom he was seen smooching on the slopes of Verbier ski resort earlier this year.

Cressida is the daughter of four-times married and divorced Lady Mary Gaye Curzon, a renowned 60s society beauty who once posed semi-naked for a glossy coffee table photography book called Birds of Britain.

Friends in high places: Cressida arrived at the Saturday service in Alnwick with 'best friend' Princess Eugenie

Society sisters: Cressida and her sister Isabella Calthorpe, who is married to Sir Richard Branson's son Sam, attend a party in London's Kensington on Thursday

She has five children with three of her husbands and one of her daughters, Isabella, by her second marriage to banking magnate John Anstruther-Gough-Calthorpe (whose family owns most of Birmingham), has just married Sir Richard Branson’s son and heir Sam.

Cressida was the product of her third marriage to Old Harrovian Jeffrey Bonas, which ended in divorce after six years in 1994.

In an interview with US television last year, handsome Harry complained that girls appeared to be put off by his title and indicated he was keen to shed his playboy tag and settle down.

‘I’m not so much searching for someone to fulfill the role, but obviously, you know, finding someone that would be willing to take it on,’ he said.

Clearly, however, his romance with Cressida is going from strength-to-strength. ‘She’s posh, pretty and perfect!’ a friend declared.
