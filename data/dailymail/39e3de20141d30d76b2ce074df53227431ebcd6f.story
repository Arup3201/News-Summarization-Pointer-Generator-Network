MPs last night voiced grave concerns over the arrest of a policeman accused of leaking details of Andrew Mitchell’s foul-mouthed ‘pleb’ rant.

Scotland Yard said a constable in the Diplomatic Protection Group was held on suspicion of misconduct in public office relating to the leaking of details of the former Chief Whip’s confrontation with officers at the gates of Downing Street in September.

But the decision prompted anger among both rank-and-file officers and MPs – with critics warning the episode raised ‘chilling’ questions about the ability of whistle-blowers to go public with their concerns.

'Plebs': An officer has been arrested over a leak that led to the resignation of Tory Chief Whip Andrew Mitchell (pictured) after an altercation with officers in Downing Street

Mr Mitchell, who was forced to quit 
the Cabinet the following month, welcomed the development, saying he had
been the victim of ‘false’ claims. 

Last night it also emerged that 
another MP has been dragged into the inquiry after the Independent 
Police Complaints Commission said the officer under investigation may 
have spoken to their local Member of Parliament about what happened 
outside the No 10 gates. 

A report into Press standards by Lord 
Justice Leveson, published last month, recommended banning so called 
‘off the record’ conversations between police officers and journalists.

At the time, critics said this could deter potential whistle-blowers who
may be too scared to reveal potentially important information for fear 
of being arrested.

Last night Tory MP Philip Davies said:
‘Officials should not be arrested for leaking information they believe 
to be in the public interest.

'I can understand why the police might want
to discipline someone who leaked information but it would be a very sad
day if that were ever held to be a crime.

‘I believe in free speech and a free Press and I see no reason why stories of this kind should not be printed.

‘We could either end up in a situation
where this kind of thing is explicitly not allowed, or there would be a
chilling effect in which the media and public officials become too 
scared of the consequences.’

A police log of the confrontation, 
details of which were leaked to two newspapers, is widely seen as 
costing Mr Mitchell his job in October.

He maintained yesterday the 
police account of the affair, reproduced right, was ‘false’ and insists 
he never used the word ‘pleb’.

Labour MP John Mann said: ‘This raises
big concerns about the freedom of whistle-blowers who are meant to be 
protected.

'It was without question in the public interest this 
information came out. It begs questions about what’s going on. It has 
all the characteristics of a witch-hunt.’

The Police Federation said the arrest 
was ‘disproportionate’ and of ‘great regret’. 

The IPCC is supervising 
the investigation by Scotland Yard.

The police watchdog said the 
arrested officer allegedly witnessed Mr Mitchell insulting a policeman 
outside Downing Street while he was off duty.

He is then thought to have told an MP 
about what he had seen.

Mr Mitchell resigned in October after weeks of 
controversy over what he was reported to have said to police after being
told he could not ride his bike through the main gates.

Scotland Yard said the arrest resulted
from fresh information following a previous investigation in September.

‘These inquiries found no evidence to suggest any of the officers 
involved in the incident were involved in the unauthorised release of 
information. The officer arrested was not on duty at the time of the 
incident in Downing Street.’
