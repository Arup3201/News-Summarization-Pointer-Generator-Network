The curvaceous figure which prompted outrage from viewers is covered by her demure wedding dress and as she leans forward to cut the cake, she beams like any other bride on her big day.

This is stripper Keri Graham who yesterday blamed everyone but herself for turning Britain’s Got Talent into a sleaze fest.

Mrs Graham said that her ‘classy’ dance routine was only made seedy when the ITV show’s judges David Walliams and Simon Cowell came on stage and prompted her to perform a lap dance.

Demure: Mrs Graham with husband Gary on their wedding day eight years ago

The 43-year-old writhed semi-naked with one leg over Cowell’s shoulder after he rushed on stage, egged on by Walliams, following her performance and took a seat saying ‘let’s do it’.

The married mother-of-one, who was on TV just a few weeks ago as a Las Vegas showgirl in Ant & Dec’s Saturday Night Takeaway, also said responsibility for the public’s backlash rested with ITV bosses for allowing her act to be screened before the 9pm watershed.

Speaking for the first time following the backlash she told the Mail that she believed that the routine she had initially gone on the show to perform was not sleazy.

She said: ‘My act was actually more about strength and balance, using my core strength. It was a hard routine and trying to make it flow and sexy.

‘But then the tone got lowered when Simon got on stage.’

Mrs Graham had gone on the show to perform a dance routine on a chair to explicit song Freak Me, during which she took off her clothes to show her underwear.

At the end of her performance judge David Walliams told Mrs Graham: ‘I just thought wouldn’t it be great to see Simon sat on the chair and you doing the dancing?’

After initially seeming reluctant, Cowell walked on to the stage and kissed Mrs Graham on the cheek, before sitting on the chair as Mrs Graham gave him a lap dance accompanied by Walliams.

Viewers immediately took to the Internet to express their disgust at the lap dance, with one condemning the show as ‘Britain’s Got Sleaze’.

Yesterday at her £334,000 four-bedroom detached home in Chafford Hundred, Essex, Mrs Graham said that she had sympathy with those complaining, but said it was ITV’s decision to screen it at around 7:30pm, hours before the watershed.

She said: ‘I didn’t do it to upset anybody. I do actually understand some of the concerns. But at the end of the day I did not choose to put that on ITV. That was for the ITV bosses to decide, I did the act, they did not have to show it.’

She claimed that she had made sure that her skimpy outfit was not too revealing.

She said: ‘Seriously, there is more sleaze in a Carry On movie, isn’t there? Actual bare flesh, boobs and bums. It was all about a bit of fun.

‘I went to a lot of trouble with my wardrobe. I had my cleavage covered and wore two pairs of shorts, one over the other, to make sure everything was covered. It looked sexy but classy.’

Mrs Graham, who has been married to her husband Gary for eight years, said that she only auditioned for the show ‘for a laugh’ as she was taking her 12-year-old son Callum audition as a hip hop dancer. 

‘I ran it all by him,’ she said. ‘I asked that it was all OK with him. And he said I am really proud of you mum, you have to do it. All his friends at school are very supportive.’

However, it is not clear that all the family were quite so unembarrassed by the performance. After watching the show, her step-son Seamus, who works for law firm Mishcon de Reya, wrote on Twitter: ‘Ladies and Gents, my step mum ... *hides*’

Her husband Gary yesterday refused to comment on his wife’s performance.

It is not the first time that Mrs Graham has appeared primetime Saturday night television. She appeared in four episodes of the latest series of Ant and Dec’s Saturday Night Takeaway as a Vegas show girl.

During Mrs Graham’s performance on Britain’s Got Talent she was described on screen as a ‘housewife’, yesterday she admitted that she had worked as a professional stripper.

Mrs Graham, whose stage name is Keri Gold, said that she was not ashamed of her work as stripping is now ‘very common’, but said that she now only works as a choreographer for a burlesque dance troupe.

She said: ‘Stripping is something that I did do, something in my past that I’m very proud of.‘When you become a professional dancer they pay you hardly any money, so I was trying to pay bills. I’m not saying oh poor me I was destitute and had to do it. Actually I had a brilliant time and enjoyed it.

‘It is something that is very common now, it is not something that is so shameful now. I did it and I do choreography now. I’ve moved on.’

However, the Daily Mail can reveal she was signed up to the Colchester-based LimeLite Strippers Agency near to her home in Essex, and that she only quit the company two weeks ago following her performance on Britain’s Got Talent.

A spokesman for the agency said: ‘Keri was on our books, but left two weeks ago. It was her on Britain’s Got Talent. I think her leaving was because she was going to be on the show.’

A handful of complaints about Mrs Graham’s routine have been made to ITV and around 30 to Ofcom, the media watchdog is currently considering whether or not to launch an investigation.
