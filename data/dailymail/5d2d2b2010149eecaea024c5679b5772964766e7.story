Three people also died in the car she crashed into Bobbi-Jo Johnston, 33, of Fort Fairfield and Johnston's daughter, two-year-old Alana, and her mother, Laurie Ann Johnston, 52, of Carlingford, New Brunswick.

Today it was revealed that an unknown amount of medical marijuana was stolen from Mr Lausier's home.

'I am sad to say the home was broken into the day of the accident,' Madawaska police Chief Carroll Theriault said Wednesday morning. 

Two-year-old Alana also died in the smash alongside her mother and her grandmother

He said the break-in at the Lausier house occurred sometime Monday afternoon  

'We spoke to the Lausiers' son, but he is not sure if anything else is missing,' Theriault said. 'We won't know much until Robert gets back.'

'This is as low as you can get after the tragedy that happened to this family,' Theriault said.

'That accident was such a tragedy for both families in Madawaska and in Fort Fairfield [and] for someone to break in there during their time of hurt is something as low as I have ever heard.' 

State police said they had not been able to track down the driver of the tractor-trailer, who may not have realized the crash occurred.

Bobbi-Jo Johnston, 33, of Fort Fairfield, was in the car that Mrs Lausier crashed into 

The investigation into the crash continues.

According to a fundraising page Mrs Lausier, a mother-of-two, was eight-months pregnant.

She had a teenager daughter and son. 

On her Facebook page Mrs Lausier's profession is listed as a supervisor at Madawaska School Department.

Ms Johnston's Facebook page indicates she was a hair stylist. 

According to the National Weather Service in Caribou, there were snow showers when the crash happened - photos from the scene show the route surrounded by snow.

The road was closed for several hours.
