A 31-year-old man has been identified as the main suspect in the deaths of three teenage girls who were killed in a hit-and-run while trick-or-treating in California.

Jaquinn Bell allegedly crashed his Honda CRV into twins Lexi and Alexandra Perez and their friend Andrea Gonzalez, all aged 13, at speed as they crossed the road in Santa Ana on Halloween.

The victims, who were reportedly dressed in dark costumes and black leggings, were thrown more than 100 feet down Fairhaven Avenue, according to authorities. They all died at the scene

But despite the girls' fates, Bell, from Orange County, reportedly sped off, before abandoning the damaged 2001 truck in the parking lot of a strip mall around a quarter of a mile from the scene.

Tragic: Andrea (pictured) was the third girl killed by the hit-and-run driver at around 6.45pm last Friday

The suspect and his two children, aged 14 and 17, who are also believed to have been traveling in the black vehicle at the time, then fled on foot, a witness told KTLA.

Bell was arrested outside a Motel 6 in the 7400 block of Katella Avenue, Stanton, on Sunday following a surveillance operation by investigators, Santa Ana Police Chief, Carlos Rojas, said.

He was later booked on suspicion of carrying out a felony hit and run at around 6.45pm last Friday, causing death, the news station reported. He is apparently being held on $500,000 bail.

Speaking at a press conference on Monday, Mr Rojas said the Honda CRV belonged to 'somebody associated with Mr Bell' and had been found by police sporting 'significant damage'.

When asked if Bell was aware he had been involved in a collision, the police chief replied: 'I’m not going to comment on what he might have known at the time.'

But he added: 'There’s no doubt in my mind that anybody who was driving in a vehicle that impacted three individuals... probably knew they hit something.'

Devastating:  Andrea (pictured), Lexi and Alexandra were all pronounced dead at the scene after the crash

On Sunday, Corporal Anthony Bertagna said: 'Witnesses say the vehicle was traveling at a high-rate of speed. I didn't see any skid marks, so it doesn't appear they slowed down whatsoever.

'They left these three young women laying in the street, and left without calling, without stopping, without rendering aid. It's hard to even fathom doing that.' 

Bell's detainment followed the arrests of four others in connection with the deaths of Lexi, Alexandra and Andrea, who were struck by the Honda CRV in front of Easthaven Elementary School.

The other suspects - two adults and two minors - have not been publicly identified. However, they are believed to be Bell's mother and half-sister, and the two children who were traveling with him.

The adults have  been released following their arrests at around 11am on Sunday, while the minors have been placed into protective custody.

Following Bell's arrest, Andrea's brother, Josafar Gonzalez, told KTLA: 'The people who did this left them there as if they were nothing. They’re finally in custody and have to answer to justice.

'That brings such a sigh of relief not just to my parents, not just to the twins’ family, but just to the whole community.'

On Saturday, Magaly Huerta, the twins' aunt, said her family was in complete shock at having lost 'what we lost the most'.

Speaking to ABC 7, she said: 'Why couldn't they stop the car when they saw my nieces? Why they couldn't do anything? I know God will punish them sooner or later.'

 Lexi and Alexandra's mother added: 'I cannot believe this.'  

The Alexandra and Lexi Perez Huerta Memorial Fund Facebook page was created on Saturday and asked for donations for the girls' funeral expenses.

Family, friends and residents left flowers and lit candles for the trio following the tragic incident. Some remained at the memorial site all day as they tried to come to terms with the loss.

Scene: The trio who were hit were all said to be in costume and carrying candy bags at the time

Sharon Stewart, who cuts hair at a nearby barber shop, told the Los Angeles Times that she was eating outside last Friday when she heard what sounded like a terrible crash and screaming. 

She said she turned around and saw a car leaving and people yelling, so she got in her car and followed.

Stewart said she saw a young man run from the scene and heard him yelling at what she thought was his companion. 

Maria Ramirez, 14, who lives about a half block from where the hit-and-run occurred, told The Orange County Register that she attended middle school with the twins. She last saw them at school on Halloween, she said.

Police cordon: Witnesses said they heard the squealing of tires and ran over to see tarp sheets already over two of the girls 

'I can't believe it happened,' Miss Ramirez said of the deaths of her friends, while she gathered late Friday night on the sidewalk with dozens of onlookers. 'They were fun, good girls.' 

Jeff Evans, who was trick-or-treating with his eight-year-old daughter nearby at the time said he heard squealing tires, looked over and saw the gruseome scene.

He told the O.C Register: 'When we got over here, there was already a tarp over two girls,' Evans said.

Briana Magana, 13, said she attended Santiago Charter Middle School  with one of the victims.

Response: Paramedics rushed to the crash site but two of the girls were pronounced dead at the scene. The third died while she was being taken to hospital

She told the paper the pair had attended a school dance earlier in the day and had later gone for lunch at McDonald's. 

'It's unbelievable how something like this could happen,' Briana said. 'She always had a smile, she would light up the room, and she was just a really good student.'

The Orange County district attorney's office is reviewing Bell's case.
