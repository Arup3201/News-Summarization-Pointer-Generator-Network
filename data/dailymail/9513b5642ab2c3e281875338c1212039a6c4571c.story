The old Liverpool siege mentality has returned ahead of their important encounter against Arsenal on Sunday which the club need to win to keep Champions League football a realistic proposition.

Manager Brendan Rodgers, loquacious and engaging for the majority of his two-and-a-half years in charge at Anfield, has made it clear he has now had enough of the recent criticism and backbiting aimed at him and his players.

Having pushed Manchester City so close to the title last season, Liverpool will kick off against Arsenal – whom they beat 5-1 in the corresponding fixture last February – in the bottom half of the Premier League table.

Rodgers, hurt by attacks on his nine summer signings and repeated stories about Steven Gerrard, Raheem Sterling and Mario Balotelli, is taking a leaf out of his predecessor Kenny Dalglish's book, drawing ranks and urging his players to prove everyone wrong.

'Seven months ago I was manager of the year, and tactically this and tactically that. Because we lost two world-class players, one out of the club (Luis Suarez) and one injured (Daniel Sturridge), I am useless,' he said, curtly.

'Football is a critical world. For some reason in the modern game, people don't think new players need time to develop. It is not the criticism to me personally (that angers). I am thinking of the team and the club.'

The treatment dished out to Raheem Sterling seems to have particularly irked Rodgers. 

The 20-year-old scored his first goals since September in a morale-boosting 3-1 Capital One Cup victory at Bournemouth and been given a central attacking role with Sturridge out, and Balotelli and Rickie Lambert failing in front of goal.

There is uncertainty over Sterling's long-term future at Anfield with a new deal unsigned amidst reported interest from Bayern Munich and Real Madrid, but Rodgers – again circling the wagons – has hit out at suggestions the player has taken his eye off the ball after an impressive World Cup.

'He is another kid who is going to get destroyed,' warned Rodgers. 'He has just turned 20 years of age, he was the extra log on the fire for us last year, he was outstanding and this year he has been very good. On his own really.

'People ask if he is unhappy, you couldn't see a happier guy, he is not into discussing deals and money and yet I read about the greedy Sterling. 

'The criticism has been unbelievable, it has been ongoing.'

Rodgers will doubtless get sympathy from other leading managers about the impatience of supporters and former players-turned-television pundits in Sunday's game when results like last weekend's 3-0 defeat at Manchester United happen.

Virtually every big-club manager bar Jose Mourinho has been under pressure at some point this season though interestingly we still await our first Premier League sacking of the season.

Nobody has come under more scrutiny than Sunday's visitor to Anfield, Arsenal boss Arsene Wenger, who signed a long-term contract at his club in the summer, just like Rodgers.

Wenger, who lifted the FA Cup in May to end a nine-year trophy drought, has been at Arsenal 18 years and has three Premier League titles, two league and cup doubles, two European finals and a historic unbeaten season on his record.

But recently he was abused by his own supporters after a defeat at Stoke City while a banner calling for his departure was held up in the away section at West Brom. 

Last season he was filmed and ridiculed for tripping over at a railway station after Arsenal's defeat at Anfield.

‘Some of the personal stuff he takes is disgraceful,’ said Rodgers. ‘He has been an iconic figure, a statesman.’

Rodgers will hope the cup triumph will mark a turning point for Liverpool because it represented a return to last season’s successful format.

‘If you look at the speed in our game, the tempo and intensity of our pressing and work was much closer to last season,’ he said. ‘It is a fair point that people are seeing we haven’t been as dynamic as the last couple of years.’

Rodgers hopes the 3-4-3 system he used at Dean Court to accommodate Sterling as a deep-lying centre forward able to break into space may be a template for better things.

‘A British coach, playing 3-4-3? He must have fell onto that system, a bit of luck,’ he said sarcastically.

Rodgers seems to be having fun revealing a more spiky aspect of his nature. Now the players must follow suit.
