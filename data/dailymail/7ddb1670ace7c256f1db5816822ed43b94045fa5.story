That's a wrap - Mercedes-Benz Fashion Week Australia came to a close on Thursday night in Sydney, with the Johanna Johnson show bringing the event to a spectacular close with her Hollywood-inspired Sirens' Call presentation. 

Now that the heels have been kicked off, the cameras put down, and the last bottle of champagne drunk, FEMAIL take a look back at the week, taking note of the trends emerging from the shows, the beautiful designs we can't wait to hang in our wardrobes and the trends we won't be trying any time soon.

Some dazzling creations had fashion spectators dreaming of an occasion special enough to warrant a couture price tag, other trends were so wearable we wanted to snap them up straight off the model's backs... while a few were downright bizarre.

Make-up trends and accessories threatened to overshadow many of the designs being showcased, with stylists going over the top to stand out with head pieces, masks and other adornments bordering on the ridiculous. 

The week that was: MBFWA featured loud prints, metallic, intricate detailing in couture masterpieces from highlight shows Romance Was Born (left), Toni Maticevski (L) and Steven Khalil (middle R)... and some very different beauty looks and trends we won't try in real life (R)

Bigger was better this week with voluminous silhouettes appearing again and again at some of the star shows, including Maticevski and Michael Lo Sordo.

Skin is definitely in - flimsy, sheer fabrics were a fixture on the catwalk, with the front row receiving an eyeful as breasts, backsides and everything else were put on display beneath see-through mesh and lace designs. 

A key beauty trend on the catwalk appeared to be face bling - both Akira Isogawa and Bondi Bather sent models down the runway with sequins and beads glued to their faces.

Meanwhile eyebrow-raising head wear frequently outshone the designs on parade - from perspex masks made to look like plastic bags blowing in the wind, to giant animal heads, and Ned Kelly-inspired head pieces.

METALLICS

Shine on: Maticevski (left), Ginger & Smart (middle), and Johanna Johnson (right) wowed with metallic golds and bronzes

Metals were a recurring feature on the catwalk. 

Head-to-toe gold dazzled at Toni Maticevski, while Johanna Johnson showed full-length skirts. Ginger & Smart's bronze dresses were favourites for their wear-ability off the catwalk. 

VOLUMINOUS SILHOUETTES 

Big is better: Toni Maticevski (left), Ellery (middle), and Michael Lo Sordo (right) all presented voluminous silhouettes

The future is now: Contemporary styles by Maticevski (left and right) and Romance Was Born (middle) were masterpieces of design, wearability is questionable

Big is better - silhouettes went super-sized at many of the highlight shows. 

Maticevski, Romance Was Born, Ellery and Michael Lo Sordo all presented billowing, voluminous gowns.

SLOUCHY COMFORT 

Pyjama party: Laid-back, slouchy silhouettes featured in the (L-R) Haryono Setiadi, Gary Bigeni, Tome, and Serpent & The Swan shows will make for a comfortable season

Next season looks to be a comfortable one. As well as the oversized evening wear being showcased, ready-to-wear separates were inspired by bedtime.

Haryono Setiadi, Gary Bigeni, Tome, and Serpent & The Swan all presented slouchy, pyjama-style ensembles. 

COUTURE CREATIONS 

Dazzling: Couture creations made a splash - our favourites were seen at (L-R) Galanni, Steven Khalil, and Johanna Johnson

Masterpiece: Betty Tran on Thursday night presented a show-stopping gown

Heavenly show-stopping masterpieces were highlights of the week, with intricate hand-sewn embellishments, fringing, feathers, and sheer fabrics key trends. 

Johanna Johnson closed the week with a number of beautiful creations, while Steven Khalil, Betty Tran and Galanni also sent incredibly couture down the runway. 

WE SEE RIGHT THROUGH YOU 

Peekaboo: Marriam Seddiq (left), Any Step, (middle), and Johanna Johnson (right) gave the front row an eyeful with their revealing designs

Sheer delight: Delicate sheer fabrics left little to the imagination at Mariam Seddiq (left), Kate Sylvester (middle), and Johanna Johnson (right)

 Things got a little cheeky mid-week, particularly amongst the up-and-coming designers, who strived to stand out during the New Generation and Raffles Showcase presentations.

Marriam Seddiq during the St George New Generation show and Any Step during the Raffles International Showcase in particular had the front row blushing, with their see-through creations that put models' bodies on full display. 

The Any Step show stood out for its bondage-style dress made of only leather straps and buckles.

GLADIATORS ARE BACK  

Lace it up: Bec & Bridge (left), CS Edit X Kirrily Johnston (middle), and Daniel Avakian (right) all showed knee-high Gladiator sandals

Oh, hello 2008. Your favourite footwear trend is back again.

Bec & Bridge and Daniel Akavian accessorised their wares with very similar Gladiator-style lace-up sandals, while the CS Edit X Kirrily Johnston show presented the same in metallic gold. 

BIZARRE 'BEAUTY' 

Don't try this at home: One Fell Swoop (left), Akira Isogawa (middle), and Dyspnea (right) tried out some interesting hair and beauty styles that we won't be trying in real life

The beauty looks of the week were met with some head scratching. 'Ugly' beauty, and unusual trends including sequinned faces are styles best left on the catwalk.

Hair was repeatedly slicked down, while some hair designers got crafty, creating 'origami' influenced hair style and sectioning off strands of hair to create unique designs (pictured at Dyspnea).

ACCESSORISE THIS 

Hats off to you: Blue Glue Bikinis (left), Vanessa Moe (middle) and Romance Was Born (right) were in the headlines for their out-there headwear on the runway which included oversized animal heads, perspex masks, and Ned Kelly-inspired headpieces

One-sided: Both Ellery (left and right) and Gail Sorronda (middle) sent models out sporting circular ear pieces on one side

Accessories threatened to overshadow the designs they were intended to complement. Blue Glue Bikinis sent models down the runway wearing oversized animal heads, Vanessa Moe's plastic face masks were a unique touch, while Romance Was Born's quirkiest inclusion in their Australiana-themed presentation was a Ned Kelly-inspired head piece.

Both Ellery and Gail Sorronda's models sported circular ear pieces or earrings on one side only.

STRONG IS THE NEW SKINNY 

Sporty: We Are Handsome made headlines for casting fitness influences instead of regular models for their show (left and right), while Bec & Bridge's debut Swim line show featured healthier models (middle)

The We Are Handsome show made headlines when design duo Jeremy and Katinka Somers chose to cast fitness influencers rather than traditional models in their shows. 

Lindy Klim, along with former Commonwealth Games pole vaulter Amanda Bisk, Australian Ballet star Juliette Burnett, and Yogi and Instagram star Sjana Earp, wowed the crowds as they struck strong poses and modelled the brand's new Activewear range. 

SPECTACULAR SETTINGS 

Unique: The iconic Icebergs pool was drained on Thursday to create a spectacular seaside catwalk for Ten Pieces

Australiana: The Art Gallery of NSW was transformed into a colourful floral setting for the Romance Was Born show

Moving: The Ellery show featured a performance by the Australian Ballet

While most of the shows took place at the Carriageworks venue in Eveleigh, a few designers went rogue, putting on shows in a more spectacular fashion with elaborate sets, locations and stunts.

Ellery's opening show featured a performance by the Australian Ballet and Romance Was Born were typically stand-out with their floral setting inside the Art Gallery of New South Wales. 

But the nod for most scenic setting was Ten Pieces on Thursday, who drained the iconic Icebergs pool to create a stunning seaside catwalk overlooking Bondi. 

MAKING HEADLINES 

Making news: Someone with sticky fingers stole THREE of the tablets gifted to the front row at Maticevski (left), while the fashion crowd followed in the footsteps of Kimye and the Beckhams by bringing children to the shows (right)

Highlights and headaches: The opening show on Sunday night by Ellery kicked off proceedings with Gemma Ward's triumphant return to the catwalk (left), but angered a local man who interrupted the catwalk show to complain about the noise (right)

The primarily smooth-running week was interrupted on a few occasions which grabbed our attention.

Opening night at Ellery got off to a dramatic start, with the audience witnessing the return to the catwalk by home-grown supermodel Gemma Ward.

The night took a turn, though, when a disgruntled neighbour stormed the stage complaining about the racket.

Australian fashion insiders copied the Beckhams and Kim Kardashian by turning up to the shows with their children in tow, while someone with sticky fingers stole three tablet worth $899 that were intended for front row guests.
