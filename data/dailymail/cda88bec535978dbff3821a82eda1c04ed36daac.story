Geoffrey Boycott says he is saddened that a conviction for assaulting a former lover has apparently stopped him being awarded a knighthood, claiming he is being blocked by 'something he didn't do'. 

The Yorkshire and England cricketer criticised the French courts amid reports that his conviction against a former lover had scuppered plans for him to be honoured.

A group of cricket-loving MPs, including Theresa May, had led a campaign to see the batsman named Sir Geoffrey.

The 74-year-old batsman took to Twitter to say he had been blocked from having a knighthood 'for something I didn't do'

But the bid to honour was vetoed by the Cabinet Office officials, reportedly due to Boycott's conviction, which dates back 18 years. 

Speaking out for the first time about the knighthood furore, Boycott said it was 'sad' that he could be blocked for 'something he didn't do' but said he has 'to live with this injustice'. 

Writing to his 57,000 Twitter followers, he said: 'I'm delighted that so many people thought I deserved a knighthood and sad that it can be blocked for something I didn't do.'

He added: 'Unfortunately, 18 yrs ago I was wrongly accused.  

'I tried to clear my name in France but under Napoleonic law once accused you are guilty until you can definitively prove your innocence. This is the opposite of English Law. I have to live with this injustice - and I do.

'I am frank and forthright but don't have and never will have a history of violence. Thank you again to all my supporters.'   

The batsman had received a three-month suspended sentence and £5,300 fine from a French court in 1996 for pinning down Margaret Moore and punching her in the face.

Boycott denies ever hitting Ms Moore, insisting that she slipped and injured herself after flying into a rage when he told her he was 'not the marrying kind'. 

The former England captain fought a costly two-year-legal battle to clear his name after his initial conviction at the Hotel du Cap in Antibes.

He and Ms Moore had spent the evening together drinking champagne with the American singer, Billy Joel, before she said he hit her 20 times during an argument.

He denied striking her and said bruising around her face was caused when she slipped after flying into a rage when he refused to marry her.

However he was unable to convince judges at either a retrial or appeal, where the conviction was upheld. 

Speaking to The Telegraph about the controversy, Boycott said he had moved on with his life and tried to put the incident behind him.

He said: 'I have accepted that there was an injustice you have to deal with it.'

He added: 'It's nice that lots of people have written in. It's nice that people admire you and say nice things about you.'

According to Whitehall guidelines, a criminal record should not in itself prevent a person from being considered for a knighthood as long as there is no 'outstanding issue'.  

Boycott played 108 tests and became the first England cricketer to pass 8,000 Test runs. He is still number six on England's all-time run scoring list.
