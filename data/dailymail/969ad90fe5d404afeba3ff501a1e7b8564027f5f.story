Glenn Beck got rid of his trademark blackboard for his latest performance as he headlined an event this weekend where he told his version of American history.

The spectacle was deemed the 'Man in the Moon' show, as 18,000 people watched at an outdoor amphitheatre as a tuxedo-clad Beck narrated the show that was meant to 'help people see America’s history from a completely different point of view'.

A replica moon was on stage as dancers, actors dressed as soldiers, and fireworks were all used in an effort to add theatrics to the event.

Setting the stage: Glenn Beck spoke from the stage and then later superimposed his face on the giant moon 'replica' in West Valley City on Saturday has he relayed his version of 'the history of the world'

Selective history: The performance highlighted key moments that Beck believes were truly important, like the flood that led to Noah's Ark and Abraham Lincoln's freeing of the slaves

Beck is known for weaving his religious beliefs into his public presentations, so it comes as little surprise that there were 'biblical' elements to the way that he told his version of humanity.

Beck, 49, is a converted Mormon and credits the church to helping him turn away from his drug and alcohol dependencies.

Master of ceremonies: The Saturday event was just one in a series of massive public rallies held by the former Fox News commentator (pictured here in 2009)

Though the Man in the Moon event was definitely the largest, it was just the latest in a string of public events and motivational speeches he headlined at different venues in Utah during the week of the Fourth of July.

He considers himself to be a conservative politically with some libertarian views, but the heavy-handed religious elements to his moral speeches make it little surprise that his events are well-attended in Utah, which is largely populated by Mormons.

The Salt Lake Tribune reports that the Saturday event began with two 'soldiers' walking towards the center of the stage upside down before unfurling an American flag, along with the haunting caption: 'Where were you when the world was turned upside-down?'

The conservative host then came on stage and added his own ominous threat: 'I warn you, you are really, really not going to like how it ends.'

From there, he went from being the sharply-dressed emcee to having his face super-imposed onto the replica moon, which was 35-feet in diameter, so that he could provide insights into how the 'beasts' of mankind became too greedy and invited a flood.

References to Noah's ark and the Tower of Babel flowed freely.

The focus then turned to slightly more modern history as he praised Abraham Lincoln for freeing the slaves, and dancers were called on stage to visually represent the creation of electricity.

The 'Man in the Moon' then talked about World War II and the atom bomb that put an end to the fighting.

Out with a bang: A fireworks display capped off the theatrical evening

The evening ended with some musings by Beck, where he said that more 'chapters' in earth's history are yet to be written.

If the philosophical ideas were not enough to capture the attention of the 18,000 people in attendance at the USANA Amphitheatre in West Valley City, the fireworks display at the end certainly was.

According to his website, the event was intended to be more than just a performance.

'The show was designed to tell the story of America, freedom, and man’s struggle between light and dark from the beginning of time until today,' his website says.

The most recent chapters in the book of Beck's own life story led him in different paths than many would have expected after his wildly-popular Fox News show was cancelled in 2011.

Quite the crowd: 18,000 people filled the UNASA Amphitheatre for the spectacle

At the time, Fox News chief Roger Ailes said that it was their divergent beliefs on where the show should go that led to the parting of the ways, but Beck seemed to think that it was because it had become almost too popular.

'This show has become a movement. It's not a TV show, and that's why it doesn't belong on television anymore. It belongs in your homes. It belongs in your neighborhoods,' Beck said.

Since then, he has been hosting a daily program on his own internet subscription-based channel and giving motivational speeches across the country.
