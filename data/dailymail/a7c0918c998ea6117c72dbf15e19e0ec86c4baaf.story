Thought the side boob was bad? Cringed at the concept of a 'bumster' dress, which exposes your bottom cleavage a la Rihanna? Well, it just got a whole lot worse. 

The latest fashion trend sweeping the red carpet - thanks to Rihanna, Kendall Jenner and Georgia May Jagger - is the 'almost naked' look, which, as the name suggests, exposes acres of flesh.

Kendall Jenner was the most recent celebrity to embrace the trend when she dressed to shock as she hit the red carpet at the MuchMusic Video Awards in Toronto on Sunday.

New trend? Kendall Jenner shocked fans when she rocked up to the MuchMusic awards in a gown slashed at the crotch but it seems she's simply joining in on the 'practically naked' trend that seems to be sweeping Tinseltown

Revealing
 her pelvic bones in a gown slashed from the floor to her waist, the 
teen seemed intent upon stealing the spotlight at the Canadian bash.

The
 18-year-old reality star chose a white embellished long-sleeved Fausto 
Puglisi gown featuring elaborate embellishment in the form of jewels.

Even her 
little sister Kylie, 16, seemed rather surprised by the daring choice - 
pointing at it in wonder as the pair posed for photographers ahead of 
hosting the awards show.

Kendall looked nonchalant despite her revealing gown - perhaps due to her experience as a catwalk model.

Indeed, 
she took to Instagram later in the evening to share some photos of her 
daring frock, which she captioned: 'why do one slit when you can do 
TWO!? #MMVAs.'

Would YOU dare to bare? Rihanna was the A-lister who took the trend to a whole new level when she arrived at the CFDA's in a fishnet gown

The
gown
 was otherwise gorgeous with its striking silver and gold jewelled 
detailing on the bodice, all the way down the centre of the outfit as 
well as along the sleeves.

And Kendall isn't alone in her choice of barely-there red carpet style. Rihanna, who was named 'Fashion Icon' at
 the recent CFDA awards, was the centre of attention at the New York 
event when she stepped out in a daring, totally sheer 
embellished halter dress which showed off every inch of her slim figure.

The revealing outfit was custom-made by designer Adam Selman and comprised of a
total of 216,000 Swarovski crystals.

Trial on trend: Supermodel Georgia May Jagger has also given the practically naked trend a whirl, a new fashion statement that one stylist says 'worries her'

The singer completed her look with a blinged-out Adam Selman headscarf and gloves.

Speaking about Kendall and Rihanna's fashion statement, Grazia's Katherine Ormerod, who spotted the trend, said: 'The question here isn't just of changing mores, but of taste. The red carpet is after all a professional environment rather than say, a strip club. By so obviously "going commando" and revealing her hipbones, Kendall is clearly trying to court controversy.

'Perhaps in a world in which Miley Cyrus works a front wedgie and sideboob is acceptable for the office, such reservations are dated.'

Other celebrities to court the look have included daring Iggy Azalea, Miranda Kerr, Kristen Stewart, Georgia May Jagger and, of course, Miley Cyrus.

She's a fan of it too! Singer and model Iggy Azalea wore a daring slashed gown just like Kendall's

MailOnline's resident fashion expert, Simon Glazin, said: 'There's a very fine line between showing too much of yourself and still remaining chic, and unfortunately most celebs get it wrong.

'If we wanted to see bums, nipples and pokey out hip bones we could all take a trip to our local strip club and watch Crystal Chandelier do her thing on a pole.

'I would go for the naked look, nothing gets the blood pumping more than a bit of skin!' - Patrick Hyslop, 25, London

'I think it’s really try-hard. Surely it’s sexier to wonder what’s underneath rather than have it thrust in your face from the word go. Guys like the chase and a bit of mystery. It’s like sex without foreplay.' - Jay Young, 25, London

'Rihanna took it way too far at the CFDAs in THAT sheer dress. It was classless and cheap (even though there were thousands of tiny crystals stitched onto it). Anna Wintour got an eyeful of nipple. So unnecessary.

'There's ways to show off your body...Stella McCartney created sheer panelled dresses that looked exquisite. Jane Fonda even wore one. I'm not a fan of seeing jutting hip bones and an untidy wax. Cover up a bit ladies!'

Celebrity stylist Alex Longmore said: 'The "practically naked" trend worries me. Not only is it becoming a competition on the red carpet as to who can bare more, but it seems to be sticking around for AW14.

'The Cavalli, Pucci and McQueen winter catwalk shows were full of long sheer dresses perfect for appearing in public semi-naked.

'To me there is nothing elegant about this look, it leaves little to the imagination and it doesn’t set a very good example to fans of the stars who don’t have the luxury of stepping out at night surrounded by bodyguards.

'I'm hoping this trend doesn’t hit the high street and we leave the celebrities to it, as this trend is definitely not for "real people" as we say in the Industry.'

Famous fans: Even the usually demure Miranda Kerr, left, has experimented with the flesh-baring trend while Miley Cyrus, right, is never one to shy away from flashing some skin

Hitting the high street: The trend is seeping into stores, with this £65 fishnet dress by Ashish for Topshop bound to cause a stir

Filtering through: Fresh off the catwalks, the near naked trend is hitting online retailers such as Asos but will you dare to embrace it?
