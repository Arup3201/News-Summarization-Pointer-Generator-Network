Two fluffy Siberian Huskies that allegedly mauled a cat were fatally shot up to four times each by officers who mistook the canines for rabid coyotes in Crown Point, Indiana - and the owners are furious. 

Police were called to a home on Wednesday after a woman claimed the dogs - who she believed were vicious wolves or coyotes - dragged her cat down a creek bank and cornered her husband.

Officers said they tried to deter the mud-covered dogs with pepper spray, but had to shoot when they turned on police.

However Lindsay Schild, owner of three-year-old Atka and Kenai, claimed the shooting was unjustified.

She said her dogs, which had escaped from a relative's yard in nearby Liberty Point, were not aggressive.

'I just want justice for my damn dogs,' Schild told Fox 32. 

Schild's sister Kara Michalec said the family pets had never attacked anyone.

'They [police]
had said in the report they weren't being aggressive,' Michalec told Fox 32.

'Why did they take such vicious actions right away?

'And my question is 
if they were gonna put the animals down or they had to shoot them, why 
did each dog have to be shot several times?'

Examiner.com reported that officers fatally shot each dog at least three to four times.

But police chief Peter Land said officers had no choice but to shoot after using pepper spray and making loud noises to try to scare the dogs away.

'We know now that they were two dogs, however based on their aggressive nature and physical appearance he thought they were maybe larger sized coyotes,' he told Fox 32.

'The husband was trying to fight them off using a shovel.

'The dogs are now literally circling the officer, showing their teeth, acting in a very aggressive manner.

'Our officers certainly didn't want to shoot two dogs but the situation they were presented with they really had no choice.'

According to dogbreedinfo.com, Siberian Huskies are 'loving, gentle, playful, happy-go-lucky dogs' that are 'docile, social, relaxed and rather casual'.

However, the site also noted that a 'lonely Husky, or a Husky that does not get enough mental and physical exercise can be very destructive' and 'likes to roam'.

Schild told nwitimes.com she doesn't want her dogs' deaths to be in vain.

'I'm going to do everything in my power to try to get something changed so people become more aware of huskies,' she said.

'I want to get something out there so this doesn't happen again.'
