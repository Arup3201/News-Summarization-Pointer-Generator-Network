A student has described his disgust after finding what appeared to be a chicken brain in a KFC meal.

Josh Jenkins discovered the offal after taking a bite from a piece of chicken and immediately repulsed by the 'grey and wrinkly' organ.

The 19-year-old purchased a Bargain Bucket after a night out in Bournemouth, Dorset, but only detected the offending chicken piece when eating leftovers the following day.

Disgust: While eating a piece of chicken from KFC, Josh Jenkins, 19, discovered a piece of offal he thought was a brain

The horrified student sent the chicken back to the fast food chain, who said that tests uncovered it was a chicken liver.

Mr Jenkins, from Christchurch, said: 'I was on a night out and I decided to buy a Bargain Bucket to use for 
snacks over the next couple of days.

'Next evening I was eating a couple of
pieces, and I pulled the skin off one and that was when I saw it. It 
looked just like a brain, all white and wrinkled.

'I was really shocked at the time, it 
is one of these things you hear about people finding but you never 
expect to see it on your plate.

'I thought it was absolutely disgusting, it made me feel queasy.'

The chain has since apologised to Mr Jenkins but he insists he will never eat in one of its branches again.

Vile: The horrified student sent the chicken back to the fast food chain who said that it was a kidney after tests

He added: 'KFC have offered me some 
sort of goodwill gift but I don't think that is really acceptable, since
I don't want to eat there again.

'It's vile even if it isn't brain and it has put me off eating chicken.'

A spokesman for KFC said that the item, identifying it as kidney, posed no risk to human health.

He said: 'We're really sorry for Mr Jenkins' experience. We sell 200 million pieces of chicken every year and always try to ensure the highest standards in every restaurant.

'However, because all our chicken on 
the bone is freshly prepared by hand, unfortunately on rare occasions, 
human error can mean that a giblet is not removed in the preparation 
process.

'After a thorough investigation we can confirm that this was the case.

'We have apologised to Mr Jenkins and 
will be providing him with a gesture of goodwill, and are retraining our
cooks in the restaurant to ensure this doesn't happen again.'
