Life in the fast lane: B2C's Nick Sayer on a £17,000 Harley-Davidson

The data Del Boy

Posing on a £17,000 Harley-Davidson, Nick Sayer soaks up the winter sun outside his holiday home in Florida.

It is one of several shots of motorbikes, supercars and lavish holidays he has posted online in recent years…to the delight of his friends.

For while pensioners are targeted every day by cold callers, the man who sold their personal data is apparently relishing the spoils.

B2C director Sayer – who is nicknamed Del Boy – is among a group of bosses at the firm who have got rich quick by selling people’s most personal information.

The 45-year-old father-of-two says he carries out his business from a ‘man cave’ in the garden of his home in Kent.

He began his working life as a diver on oil rigs in Azerbaijan, before, he claims, he was set up in business by a Greek shipping billionaire.

They ran a commercial diving company before he decided to make money for himself by selling personal data with a series of companies, most of which have been dissolved or liquidated. ‘For years I was called “oh, you’re just a Del Boy”,’ he said. ‘I work from home, I’ve got a little log cabin thing out in me garden, that’s where I kind of base me-self.

‘I don’t like being in the house, I just go out there. It’s a bit of a man cave really.’

While his garden office may be modest, Sayer’s other tastes are much more ostentatious. His Facebook page shows off images of nine sports cars as well as pictures of him skiing in Banff, Canada.

The British-built TVR Tuscan Speed Six sports car which he pictures on a drive on his profile costs up to £50,000 and boasts a top speed of 180mph.

The Harley-Davidson Road King motorbike he is seen on in one image costs £17,595 new. Sayer regularly holidays with his family at his villa in Kissimmee, Florida, which they rent out for £600 a week. The home has a games room, swimming pool and spa, five bedrooms and four bathrooms, all ‘fitted with luxury furnishings’.

The fake cash fraudster

Also trading in people’s personal information for B2C is convicted fraudster Gary Doran, 36, who wanted the Mail’s undercover team to pay Sayer off the books. The Mancunian, who now lives in Marbella, was jailed for six months for fraud in 2004 for trying to use two fake £10 notes to buy vodka.

A 23-year-old student at Manchester Metropolitan University at the time, he tried to buy drink with the fake money at the Queen of Hearts pub in Fallowfield. The barmaid rejected the notes and the police were called, later finding him with 15 other fake bank notes.

After serving time in jail, he has since run several failing businesses with his father and brother from their family home in Manchester.

Most recently, as sales director of B2C Data, he asked an undercover reporter from the Mail to buy data off the books as a ‘favour to a friend’. He wanted the money to be paid directly into Sayer’s personal account, as a way of avoiding tax.

Jet-setting boss who said he knew nothing

B2C owner Stephen Hogg insists his firm ‘do everything completely, totally and utterly by the book’.

The jet-setting golfer was, however, completely oblivious to his staff offering to sell data tax free through their own accounts.

He even had no idea Doran had previously served time for fraud.

The 46-year-old lives with his wife Sarah, 43, and their children in a £400,000 five-bedroom house in Rushden, Northamptonshire.

Last week, there were three cars on the driveway outside the large home in a secluded cul-de-sac.

Hogg appears to have spent much of the past month playing golf at clubs across Bedfordshire and Buckinghamshire. He and his wife also go online to boast of their holidays to Portugal and Australia.

‘Holidays, bar, golf and no diet!, he wrote during one of his travels.

The couple, who have two children, started B2C Data just three months after his previous data company Unique Prospects was dissolved.

He said he has also shut another firm down in the past after ‘certain allegations’, before insisting ‘that wasn’t my company by the way’.

When approached by the Mail about B2C’s activities, Hogg said: ‘We are a member of the ICO [Information Commissioner’s Office], and DMA [Direct Marketing Association]. We do everything correctly.’

When told his employees had offered to sell his company’s data off the books and that Doran is a convicted fraudster, he added: ‘You’ve just made me aware of two things that I need to go and talk to people about.’ He described B2C Data as ‘a legitimate business’ working within the law.

Cold callers use a wide range of tricks to obtain people's personal data (picture posed by model)

Will writing: Pensioners are often targeted by callers who offer will writing advice on the cheap.

This is often a ploy to gain your trust and access as many personal details – including about your finances – as possible. The firms then try to sell high risk investments as ‘add-ons’.

Charity surveys: A homeowner is called and asked to complete a survey for charity. They are told if they answer a certain number of questions, a pre-selected charity will be paid £10 or so – so many kind-hearted people naturally agree.

However, all the answers are collated and sold on.

‘Validating’ your details: Marketing firms will call customers of a major brand and claim they need to ‘validate’ the details they hold.

After asking the customer to confirm their name, address and phone number, however, many will go on to try to get you to complete a ‘lifestyle survey’. These questions are, in fact, sponsored by various other companies and details are sold on.

Soft questions: Watch out for surveys starting with ‘easy’ questions. One firm admitted it starts surveys with questions anyone would answer – like do you have a television? Only later do the questions become more intrusive – about your earnings and the worth of your home.

Computer updates: Scammers try to hack into PCs by pretending to be from Microsoft. Following their ‘updating’ instructions can allow them to take control of the computer remotely and capture personal data.

No call lists: The telephone preference list, which should block cold callers, is a free service. Some firms will, however, try to charge you as much as £1.60 a month.

Shares: With your financial details on file, some cold calling firms are able to see which companies you have shares in. As a result, scammers can pretend to be calling from the companies you have invested in and try to convince the homeowner to pass on more financial details.

Prizes: Once they have your details, scammers are able to send you misleading letters saying you have won large cash prizes. There are often hidden costs in claiming this supposed prize, like making you call premium rate phone numbers.
