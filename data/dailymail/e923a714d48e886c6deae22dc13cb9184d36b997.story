'Extras': NHS Alliance chair Dr Michael Dixon warns patients could end up paying for 'better food' or IVF

Patients could soon have to pay for ‘hospital extras’ such as better food or IVF, a top GP has warned.

Michael Dixon, president of the NHS Clinical Commissioners and chairman of the NHS Alliance, said doctors had to consider introducing new charges to balance the rising costs of treatment and an ageing population.

He said patients were already charged for prescriptions and hospital parking, so other services should also be considered.

Dr Dixon, who represents the GP-led Clinical Commissioning Groups, said: ‘We need to start discussing the real taboo subject of the NHS, which is co-payment. No one wants to discuss it but it is already happening.

'Patients pay for parking, the television sets on the wards and if you want to see an osteopath, you have to pay yourself.

‘The very wealthy are doing it already by accessing the NHS when it suits them and going private when they don’t.’

But he added the NHS ‘never allow an NHS patient to live, die or go bankrupt depending upon how much he or she can pay’.

At a Westminster Health Forum event on the future of the NHS yesterday, Dr Dixon said the service is facing a £30billion funding gap in ten years.

He said: ‘If someone wanted a surgical procedure or medicine that didn’t have a proven benefit they could pay for that and also for someone else to have another treatment.

‘Things like car parking or television sets are fairly easy, then on the edge of that, what about dining-room extras like food, or more comfortable beds?

‘I don’t think we should be too afraid of this discussion because the alternative is rationing where no one can have it.’ Dr Dixon added: ‘It’s about being inventive in how we create income in the health service so that we can get more resources to look after patients and don’t continue going back to taxpayers saying “can you give us more”.’

GP-led Clinical Commissioning Groups, which replaced Primary Care Trusts earlier this year, were given £65million by the Government to spend on local health services.

The reforms are intended to cut bureaucracy, reduce costs and foster competition, encouraging private firms and charities to take on health service contracts.

In August, Dr Dixon said hospitals will have to shrink or close altogether in the wake of new reforms that have given GPs control of more than two-thirds of the health service’s budget.

He said that diagnostic tests, outpatient appointments and much of elderly care should be moved to local clinics to improve services and save money.
