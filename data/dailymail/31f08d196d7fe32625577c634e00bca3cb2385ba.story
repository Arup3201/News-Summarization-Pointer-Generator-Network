Sunny-side up? Harry uses the glare coming off the building to cook an egg

Welcome to the second Great Fire of London.

Just around the corner from here, in Pudding Lane, in this very week in 1666, an absent-minded baker, Thomas Farriner, left his buns in the oven for too long — leading to the greatest conflagration the capital has ever seen.

This time, it’s absent-minded property developers — Canary Wharf Group and Land Securities — whose 525 ft high, 37-floor building at 20 Fenchurch Street is unintentionally acting as a giant death ray.

Indeed, the laser beam that nearly bisected James Bond in Goldfinger has nothing on this.

Every day over the past week, for two hours from around midday to 2pm, the bright light reflection of the sun has moved slowly across a stretch of pavement in Eastcheap — just by the Monument, the massive column that marks the spot where the Great Fire of London began. 

Even on a relatively cloudy day like yesterday, it was possible to fry an egg on the pavement where the glare lands.

I know because I tried it. Every day, City hedgefunders race along the pavement to avoid being toasted.

The problem is that the whole of the sun-facing side of the curved building — known as the Walkie Talkie Tower because its distinctive shape resembles an old-fashioned mobile phone — acts as a mirror as the concave surface focuses all light on a single spot on the ground.

In the neighbouring Viet Cafe, they hardly need bother turning on their cookers to heat up their pho noodles. In Re-Style Gentleman’s Grooming, the glare is so intense that it’s burnt a black disc the size of a saucer into the welcome mat.

And anyone unlucky enough to park their car in the bays opposite the building — dubbed the Walkie Scorchie by some wags — is in trouble.

Last week, Martin Lindsay, the director of a tiling company, left his Jaguar XJ on Eastcheap for just an hour, only to return to find it melted by the heat.

The panels and wing mirror were buckled, and there was a  smell of burning plastic.

Eddie Cannon, a heating engineer, suffered a similar  fate with his Vauxhall Vivaro. He said: ‘The van looks a  total mess. Every bit of plastic on the left-hand side and everything on the dashboard has melted, including a bottle of Lucozade.’ 

The parking bays have now been suspended by the City of London authorities while  the developers try to solve  the problem.

Standing directly in the line of fire, I feel as if I’m on a Hollywood movie set, drenched in a glare so impossibly intense that it seems artificial.

Particularly in London in September, when what you’re expecting is the beginning of soft  autumnal light. 

Elsewhere in the capital, temperatures are a pleasant enough but unremarkable 25 degrees Centigrade in the shade. But as I move into the focus of the death ray, I instantly start sweating as my thermometer hurtles through 38 degrees Centigrade — hotter than most places on the Med.

It is like suddenly being on a massive sunbed. Stay here any longer and I’ll be thoroughly Tangoed. Television reporters have rushed here from the hottest parts of the globe — Singapore, South Africa, Brazil — to cover the phenomenon. London at Copacabana levels of heat?

Impossible, surely! When I leave the thermometer on the shopfront of the Viet Cafe for a few seconds, the temperature rockets up to the maximum possible, 42 degrees centigrade.

A block of butter melts in minutes; my notebook is too hot to handle; our photographer’s flash overheats; an egg sizzles away in the frying pan I’ve brought with me.

The Walkie Talkie Tower is one of the City’s most prestigious new developments — one in a series of skyscrapers rising up alongside the Gherkin and the Cheesegrater on London’s sprouting skyline.It cost £200 million and is due to be finished next spring.

Before then, though, the developers and Uruguayan-born architect Rafael Vinoly will have to decommission the death ray.

‘We are taking the issue of light reflecting seriously and are looking into the matter as a priority,’ said a spokesman for Land Securities and Canary Wharf, who formed a 50:50 joint venture to develop 20 Fenchurch Street.

‘The phenomenon is caused by the current elevation of the sun in the sky. It lasts for approximately two hours per day, with initial modelling suggesting that it will be present for approximately two to three weeks. 

‘We are consulting with local businesses and the City to address the issue in the short term, while also evaluating longer-term solutions to ensure the issue cannot recur in future.’

The problem is that they have accidentally designed an incredibly effective heat reflector.

The building, with its huge bank of windows, doesn’t just act like a solar reflector: because that bank of windows is concave on its south-facing facade, it also gathers together the sun’s rays, bounces them back and concentrates them on a focal point — which  happens to be that stretch of pavement on Eastcheap.

Dr Simon Foster, a solar physicist at Imperial College London, says: ‘People have known about the phenomenon for thousands of years.

‘In the same way that a satellite dish works, the building is a parabolic reflector, collecting solar energy over a vast area and focusing it on a point — and, as a result, you’re getting massive heat levels.’

Dr Foster has visited the site to assess the issue for himself. ‘Paintwork on the shops is being burnt, and I could feel myself boiling,’ he says.

‘The developers might well have considered it but thought it was unlikely to be this bad.’

He says the same principle is used to light the Olympic flame: you take a curved silver surface and the sun heats up the torch to burning point.

Dr Foster has been recording temperatures and has registered a high of 92.6 degrees Centigrade, only a few degrees short of water’s boiling point.

‘Any hotter and things could be set on fire,’ says Dr Foster. ‘There won’t be another Great Fire of London, but you might well get a small one.’

As I stand in the direct glare, the heat is agonising. Remember, too, that the building still hasn’t been finished: there’s a big chunk of windows yet to be installed.

Stare for a second at the gleaming facade and you risk being blinded.

As the sun moves westward, so the hotspot moves along the Eastcheap pavement, scorching a new batch of City bankers on their way to grab their takeaway lunch.

How on earth can you stop this mammoth microwave from cooking up more lunchtime workers?

‘It is nothing to do with the summer heat,’ says Dr Foster. ‘You could get the same effect in winter. 

‘It’s related to the height of the sun, which varies throughout the year, and the moment the sunlight hits the building at the right point.’

He says that the answer is to paint the windows with a non-reflective matte surface that absorbs the sun’s rays.

Or to cover them with slightly speckled material that scatters the solar radiation and doesn’t produce a focus. 

Alternatively, the whole shape of the building could be redesigned — but that remedy would cost a fortune.

Meanwhile, the developers have announced they will be erecting a temporary scaffold screen at street level to block out the sun’s rays while they seek a longer-term solution.

Behind the screen, the second Great Fire of London will continue until the sun stops shining or highly-paid architects start to get a bit smarter about learning their solar physics.
