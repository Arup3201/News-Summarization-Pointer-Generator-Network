Sportsmail's Jamie Redknapp delivers his verdict on the weekend's Premier League action.

Jack Wilshere was back to his best in Arsenal's 2-2 draw against Manchester City and made a few critics eat their words. 

Elsewhere, Manchester United earned their first win of the season, Chelsea stormed to their fourth straight win as a Diego Costa hat-trick saw them beat Swansea 4-2 at Stamford Bridge and Liverpool were beaten by Aston Villa at Anfield. 

Jack's back 

It was great to see Jack Wilshere back to his best against City.

He did well against Besiktas, played OK for England, but on Saturday he reminded us all what he can do. He played with a smile on his face, took the game by the scruff of the neck and was so composed for his goal.

Roy Hodgson wants to use him in a holding role but why waste his attacking talents? He was at his best in the opposition half, as his heat map shows (right).

He can play that deep role but it would be better for England if he played there every week. I was more than happy, too, for Jack to have a pop back at me after I criticised him recently.

I did it as a player so know what it’s like. But I’m paid to give my opinions and he’s paid to ram them down my throat. That’s just what he did against City. Long may it continue.

Could Diego be the new Drogba?

Diego Costa has hit seven goals in four games, quicker than any Chelsea striker in recent times. 

Chelsea spent an awful lot of time and money trying to replace Didier Drogba. It looks like they have finally found their man.

What more can you say about Diego Costa? He has arrived in the Premier League and is probably thinking: ‘Everyone is scared of me and I’ve got Cesc Fabregas to supply the bullets.’ He must be absolutely loving it.

He has seven goals in four games — it took Drogba 18 games to match that — and Costa is the complete package, scoring with both feet and his head. He is the real deal.

Villa's tactical masterclass

Paul Lambert must love going to Anfield. The Villa boss has never lost a Premier League game there as a manager, drawing once with Norwich and now winning twice and drawing once with Aston Villa.

The latest win was thoroughly deserved. They let the two centre backs have the ball, but as soon as Steven Gerrard, Philippe Coutinho or Jordan Henderson got it, Villa stopped them playing.

It was the first time since December 2012 that Liverpool didn’t have Luis Suarez or Daniel Sturridge and it showed — they lacked a cutting edge up front. Villa were aggressive, Philippe Senderos bullied Mario Balotelli and the result showed what an astute tactician Lambert is.

Next up for LVG: Are diamonds forever?

It was an impressive attacking show from United at Old Trafford. That’s only to be expected now with the embarrassment of riches they have in their squad.

United went back to four in defence with a midfield diamond and looked much better for it. But will Louis van Gaal stick with it?

Louis van Gaal finally earned his first win as Manchester United manager as they smashed QPR 4-0

VIDEO Van Gaal happy to get goals on the board 

1992 - QPR have not kept a clean sheet against Manchester United since 1992 — their first ever Premier League meeting.

I was in the Sky studio on Sunday with Patrick Kluivert, who knows Van Gaal better than anybody, and he is convinced United will end up with a back three. Even with a four, QPR still created chances, and United will have tougher tests to come when they face the likes of Man City and Chelsea.

The system they did use looked good and Angel di Maria was exceptional, but I enjoyed watching Ander Herrera. He was always involved, looked sharp and comfortable on the ball and used it well. He proved he’s got an eye for goal, too, and provided plenty of sparkle in United’s midfield diamond.

Stones can be a rock at the back

Injury might have ruled out Sylvain Distin for Everton’s 2-0 win at West Brom, but he could find it hard to get himself back in the team.

He and Phil Jagileka have been stalwarts for Everton, but the team had conceded 10 goals in three games. With John Stones coming in at centre back, they kept a clean sheet.

The young man can play right back at a pinch but his long-term future is in the middle. He is comfortable in possession, has great recovery speed and now has a big season ahead of him. It could be time for a changing of the guard.

Pelle has Saints marching on 

When the likes of Adam Lallana, Dejan Lovren and Rickie Lambert left Southampton for Anfield, fans were worried about battling relegation.

But it’s been business as usual on the south coast and, though there’s a long way to go, I’m sure the Saints fans will be enjoying seeing their side above Liverpool in the table.

Lambert left but Graziano Pelle has come in and already looks settled. He’s played all over the place but he has good technique for a tall man and is linking up well with Dusan Tadic. You couldn’t really call it a deliberate one-two for Pelle’s second, but they are forming a good partnership. Southampton looked ready to implode at the start of the season but results have helped calm things down. I’m sure there’s a few more gems in the academy too — that place is a production line.

34 - Leicester have scored in 34 of their last 35 league games. The only fixture where they failed to find the net was Chelsea at Stamford Bridge last month.

Ulloa looking lively for Leicester

What a result for Leicester and what a good start to his Premier League career by Leonardo Ulloa.

He cost big money from Brighton, even at the age of 28, but he has already impressed me.

He looked a composed player against Arsenal and he was in such good form he probably didn’t want the international break to come round.

But he picked up where he left off against Stoke with the winner. He took it well, too, because the cross was slightly behind him so he had to adjust his feet quickly and finish from an awkward spot.

There is good pace in Nigel Pearson’s team, and Esteban Cambiasso will add some much-needed top-level experience. But so far this season, Ulloa has been their star performer.

Jamie's Premier League number crunching

7 - It was not his best game in an Arsenal shirt, but Aaron Ramsey still produced the goods against City. His pass set up Jack Wilshere and Ramsey has been directly involved in seven Arsenal goals in his last eight league games, scoring four and assisting three. And, since the start of last season, no Arsenal player has provided more assists than the all-action midfielder — he has nine.

2 - Aston Villa did a fine job of making sure Liverpool were kept quiet. There were just two shots on target in the whole match at Anfield, and the second of those came in the 11th minute.

4 - Dusan Tadic has kept up his creative form from last season. He has four assists in his last six league games for Twente and Southampton.

5/36 - Things do not look good for Alan Pardew and Newcastle. Of the last 36 league points on offer, his side have won just five. They have won one, drawn two and lost nine of their last 12 matches.

3 - Despite angling for a move away, Morgan Schneiderlin is enjoying himself at Southampton. He already has three goals this season, one more than in the whole of last campaign.

100th - It's not one Harry Kane will be proud of, but his own goal against Sunderland was the 100th Premier League goal of the season.

1 - West Brom must sort out their home form if they want to stay in the Premier League. Another home defeat, this time by Everton, means Alan Irvine’s men have won just one of their last 11 home league games, drawing seven and losing three.
