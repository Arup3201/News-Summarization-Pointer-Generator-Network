Jimmy Bullard in the jungle was a sad, sorry sight. 

In some ways it epitomised what’s wrong with English football – too many who have the privilege of being involved in our beautiful game see it as one big joke.

Bullard became the first contestant to be voted off the ITV show on Monday after topping the public vote.

Bullard gave fellow contestant Jake Quickenden some stick during the show

Don’t get me wrong, apart from the unnecessary and annoying shouting, Bullard seemed to enjoy being Down Under, and the bullying of non-league footballer-turned-X-factor-reject Jake Quickenden (which was passed off as ‘banter’, the standard fallback excuse used by those who enjoy putting others down in a sad attempt to make themselves look good), the former Hull City midfielder was one of the entertainers in this current series of I’m A Celebrity Get Me Out of Here.

But he was wasted in there.

Watching Bullard lose his nerve in a tomb of rats and literally running away because he was so scared, you might be forgiven for thinking he isn’t the kind of guy you’d want next to you in the trenches.

You might be right in those circumstances, with hunger and darkness overwhelming him, and home thousands of miles away (although Edwina Currie managed to see it through).

But in football terms, Bullard was brave. I’ll give you two examples from early in his career.

Firstly back in 2002, I commentated on an FA Cup tie at Darlington in which Jimmy was playing for Peterborough United. (Ironically, in his excellent autobiography published recently, EastEnder Bullard described moving to Peterborough as like ‘emigrating to Australia’).

This Cup tie at Darlington was crucial – the winner would face Newcastle – led by Sir Bobby Robson and Alan Shearer - at home in the fourth round. A massive money-spinner for either Darlington or Posh.

Bullard in action for Peterborough against Oldham Athletic back in 2003

The home side went 2-0 in front and even missed a twice-taken penalty.

Posh pulled one back, and then won a penalty. The previous week Bullard had missed not one but two spot-kicks against Port Vale. The first was saved by the keeper low to his left, the second saved low to his right. 

Despite his Vale fail the week before, Bullard was desperate to take it, so he grabbed the ball and hit the net. Posh won the replay and earned a small fortune from the Newcastle tie. That’s bottle from Bullard.

The second example came later that same season, shortly before Bullard earned a move to Wigan on his way to the Premier League. I was in the away end as Posh travelled to Stockport. 

Bullard's sparkling form for Fulham earned him a call-up to the England squad in 2008

Posh were shocking, truly terrible, and were comfortably beaten, the 2-1 scoreline at the end flattered Peterborough. But Bullard stood out head and shoulders above everybody else on the pitch. 

Despite being 2-0 behind, he wanted the ball all the time. He wanted to take responsibility; he wanted to make things happen. He was the one running back to the keeper to receive the ball and start something off, trying to get his team into the game. 

In football terms, that’s brave – when your team is terrible, you’re being soundly beaten, none of your team-mates are on your level, yet you don’t hide, you don’t belt it long up the field as far away as possible. 

The midfielder's career was hampered by some serious injury problems

No, instead, Jimmy Bullard wanted to have the ball at his feet and be a footballer. Despite defeat that night at Edgeley Park, I came away from that game full of respect for Bullard.

It’s interesting that in his book Bullard seems to crave the acceptance of fans for his comedy antics rather than his ability. Staring at Duncan Ferguson, mocking Phil Brown, diving over a load of team-mates in a penalty area. As Bullard wrote: ‘It’s always about the stuff that I did around football, rather than the football itself.’

The last time Jimmy and I spoke before he went off to Australia was when he came in to do some work at talkSPORT. 

Bullard finished his playing days at League One outfit MK Dons in 2012

He accused me of ‘leaving one on him’. Roughly translated this means he was upset that I had suggested that him and David Bentley singing the Postman Pat song to Fabio Capello’s face during an England training session wasn’t a wise course of action.

Mildly amusing? Yes. The right attitude at an international training camp? No, of course not. And I think most people who care about football would feel the same, and would therefore ‘leave one on him’. Nothing wrong with joking around, but sometimes you need to rein it in.

Bullard is good company and a great laugh. But I can’t help thinking football is missing out without him.

It should not have been I’m A Celebrity Get Me Out of Here for Jimmy, it should be: ‘I was a naturally talented footballer, get me out of here so I can pass on my knowledge to young players’.
