This giant floating egg on the River Beaulieu could well be Hampshire's quirkiest living space.

It may look like it comes straight from the set of a low-budget science fiction movie, but the giant wooden pod cost £40,000 to build and will in fact be the home and workspace of artist Stephen Turner, 58, for the next year.

The 40ft self-sustaining structure, which is registered as a boat, floats up and down with the tide and is designed to have minimal environmental impact. Stephen hopes to highlight climate change while living there.

The Exmoor Egg is artist Stephen Turner's home and workspace for the next year

Turner will spend 12 months experiencing nature while staying on board and working in the Exbury Egg. It features in the second series of Channel 4 documentary George Clarke's Amazing Spaces, which premiered on Thursday.

'My artwork is very much about nature and natural processes and the relationship we have with nature,' says Turner.

Architect Wendy Perring and project manager Phil Smith faced the task of translating Turner's values into the practical space. They showed architect and presenter George Clarke the miniature plastic prototype, demonstrating how the two halves are joined together. A door reveals an open-plan living space with kitchen and desk area.

Each half of the egg is made of two wooden skins with a membrane in between to make it watertight. It is wider at rear allowing room for two storage cupboards either side, and a very simple bathroom.

Both presenter and architect George Clarke and boat builder Paul Baker were astonished at how spacious the egg feels once you're inside

It took boat builder Paul Baker six 
months to build the space. He used 8km of cedar to complete it 
and says trying to get wood to bend round a sphere template was 
difficult.

Every one 
of the hundreds of planks was fitted by hand. After the first layer was 
complete, Baker added waterproof Epoxy Glass matting before adding the 
second layer of wood. Baker says in terms of boat building there's 
'difficult, very difficult, and then the Egg'.

Stephen Turner’s work often involves 
spending long periods in odd abandoned places, noting changes in the 
complex relationship between human-made and natural environments. His 
latest project will enable him to have a space to live in whilst he 
studies the life of the creek.

His latest venture is part of a project to explore the nature of
 the landscape and the meaning of place, amidst environmental changes. He
 is sharing his work on a blog and with local schoolchildren and once he
 has finished his residency, his work will go on display.

The Exbury Egg has been funded by the Arts Council and private sponsors.

He approached Phil Smith from SPUD (Space, Place-making and Urban Design) who
 gathered a team of architects and engineers to design the structure.

Smith has said he may eventually tour the egg to places like the Tate Modern, and is 
potentially interested in using it for other functions after Stephen Turner's tenancy there ends in June 2014.

George Clarke's Amazing Spaces is on Channel 4, Thursdays at 8pm. You can also watch the first episode on 4od.
