David Moyes has been offered a route back into football with Real Sociedad.

The Spanish club dismissed manager Jagoba Arrasate on Sunday after defeat by Malaga on Saturday, and they have turned to the former Manchester United and Everton boss

Moyes is currently in Qatar, where he has been working for BeIN Sports, and is understood to be considering the offer.

But the 51-year-old Scot is understandably cautious when he knows the next job needs to be the right one after his difficult 10-month tenure at Old Trafford.

United were the defending Premier League champions when Moyes arrived but slumped to seventh place, missing out on Champions League football for the first time since 1995-1996. 

United lost to Swansea City in the third round of the FA Cup, to Sunderland in the semi-finals of the League Cup and to Bayern Munich in the quarter-finals of the Champions League.

Moyes was sacked in late April following a 2-0 defeat at his former club Everton and Ryan Giggs was placed in temporary charge. Louis van Gaal was appointed as his replacement in the summer.

It is possible a number of opportunities could present themselves in Europe, with interest also thought to be coming from Italy. But Moyes, Sportsmail understands, is certainly interested enough to speak to the Spanish side, currently 19th in La Liga.

They finished seventh in Spain’s top division last season and have a tradition of appointing British managers. John Toshack had three spells as boss and current Wales manager Chris Coleman was also in charge between July 2007 and January 2008. Prior to that, Harry Lowe, was in charge for five years in the 1930s.

Horace Harold (Harry) Lowe, 1930-1935

Lowe was a centre half from Northwich in Cheshire who played for Northwich Victoria, Brighton and Hove Albion, Tottenham and Fulham in the first two decades of the 20th century.

He moved to Spain in 1930 and managed Real Sociedad for five season before leading Espanyol. He died in 1966.

John Toshack, 1985-1989/1991-1994/2001-2002

Welsh legend Toshack managed the club in three separate spells spanning three decades. He led Sociedad to the Copa del Rey in 1987, beating Atletico Madrid on penalties in the final.

He returned to San Sebastian after his season at Real Madrid and then again during the 2001-2002 season.

Chris Coleman, 2007-2008

After Toshack had recommended the job to him, Coleman joined Sociedad, then a second division club, in June 2007. He enjoyed success but fell out with newly-elected president Inaki Badiola and resigned in January 2008 with the club fifth in the table.
