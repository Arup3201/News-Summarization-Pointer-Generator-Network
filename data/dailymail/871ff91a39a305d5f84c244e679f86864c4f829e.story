France's Charles de Gaulle
aircraft carrier has started military operations against the Islamic
State in Iraq, a French army source said today. 

The first Rafale fighter jet took off this morning from the French flagship as it sailed about 120 miles off the coast north of Bahrain in the direction of Iraq. 

The warship’s deployment will halve the time it takes for the planes to reach Iraq for strikes against Isis from their base in the United Arab Emirates.

'The carrier and its naval group has officially started
missions as part of its Chammal operation in Iraq,' the source
told journalists in a reference to the name of the mission. 

A second source said the carrier would be engaged for
several weeks in the Persian Gulf. 

French President Francois Hollande announced the deployment of the Charles de Gaulle - named for the wartime French leader - days after the deadly terrorist attacks by Islamist radicals in Paris last month. 

The carrier's warplanes began operations this morning, said Le Figaro newspaper, which is accompanying Defence Minister
Jean-Yves Le Drian ahead of an official announcement he is set
to make on the carrier today.

The news came as it was claimed that U.S.-led airstrikes on ISIS targets had resulted in the deaths of 1,600 people - the majority of them terrorists - in Syria and Iraq over the past five months.

France was the first country to join the coalition
in airstrikes against ISIS insurgents in Iraq, who
have also taken control of large parts of neighbouring Syria
during the course of the civil war there.

The country has, however, ruled
out striking the group in Syria.

The Charles de Gaulle arrived in the Persian Gulf on February 15, Stars And Stripes reported. It completed a port visit to Bahrain yesterday, which French officials told the military journal was to finalise 'operational details' with the U.S. 5th Fleet. 

The 42,000-ton, nuclear-powered aircraft carrier is accompanied by an attack submarine, several frigates, including a British anti-submarine frigate and a refueling ship. The Charles de Gaulle is carrying a dozen Rafale fighter-bombers and nine Super Étendard strike jets, according to Le Figaro. 

They join a further nine fighter jets, a maritime patrol aircraft and
a refuelling plane at France's base in the United Arab Emirates. It also operates six Mirage fighter
jets from Jordan. With the Charles de Gaulle, there are now more than 3,000
French military personnel involved in the operation. 

French aircraft this weekend struck targets in Sinjar, the region of northern Iraq where thousands of members of the Yazidi minority group have been under siege for months by ISIS militants. 'By late [Saturday] evening, a patrol took off on a planned air strike to destroy ISIL combat positions,' a spokesman for the ministry said. 'Around ten targets were destroyed by French fighter jets using AASM1 bombs.'

French Air Force jets made a total of 22 sorties over Iraq, the statement said.

Blast: News that France is engaging ISIS targets in Iraq comes as the UK-based Syrian Observatory for Human Rights said U.S.-led airstrikes (pictured in the Syrian city of Kobane) had already killed 1,600 people

Militants: The flow of European fighters to ISIS-held territory is drying up due to tighter restrictions that prevent would-be jihadis from travelling, fighters from the group said

France has barred six people from leaving the country because they wanted to join extremists in Syria.

It the first such travel ban under a new law aimed at keeping French radicals from gaining violent experience abroad.

French interior minister Bernard Cazeneuve says some 40 others will face travel bans in the coming weeks. He did not name the six.

The bans issued today are the first since a sweeping anti-terrorism law passed last year.

The government is especially worried since attacks in Paris last month killed 20 people, including three gunmen claiming ties to Islamic extremists in Syria and Yemen.

An Interior Ministry official says the passports and ID cards of the six have been declared invalid for six months, a measure that can be extended for up to two years.

News that France is engaging ISIS targets in Iraq comes as the UK-based Syrian Observatory for Human Rights said U.S.-led airstrikes had already killed 1,600 people.

Almost of those killed are understood to have been aligned with ISIS or with rival Sunni terror group and Al-Qaeda affiliate, Jabhat al-Nusra.

The monitor recorded a total of 62 civilian deaths as a result of the bombing campaign. 

America and several Arab nations launched a bombing campaign against the militants in Syria last September.

The operation built campaign against the group in neighbouring Iraqi territory.

The flow of European fighters to ISIS-held territory is drying up due to tighter restrictions that prevent would-be jihadis from travelling, fighters from the group said.

Fighters in Syria and Iraq said the impact was limited on the battlefield since European fighters make up only a fraction of ISIS forces.

'Now most of the fighters are coming from Asian countries, like Tajikistan and Uzbekistan. They are tough fighters,' an ISIS source said.
