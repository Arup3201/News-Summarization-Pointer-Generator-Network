The man with the fastest draw in SW19 was not hanging around. Milos Raonic, a Canadian with a serve that doubles the speed limit on British motorways, is through to the third round after discarding Jack Sock in straight sets.

Raonic needed only an hour and 43 minutes  to see off the world No 77, crushing the American 6-3, 6-4, 6-4 to move towards a quarter-final clash with Rafael Nadal, assuming all runs to form.

Not that grass court tennis offers any such guarantee, even for a player with a delivery so effective on this surface. Raonic was far from his best against the 21-year-old, but rarely needed to raise his game.

The eighth seed got by with an impressive first serve average of 124mph – his fastest on record is 155mph – and reached a speed of 136 along the way. Sock took only 13 points all match when facing. 

Indeed, between Sock and Matthew Ebden, Raonic’s first-round victim, only one break point has been offered and it was not taken. With his net play and strong forehand, the 23-year-old can be a significant figure here, with the expectation being that he will soon mount a challenge on the top players in the men's game.

‘A lot more work needs to be done,’ he said. ‘I want to do much better than I have in the past. I have to go out there and fight and compete.’
