'Poignant': The body of army cadet instructor Arthur Jones was found near a memorial dedicated in Crete dedicated to Greek cadets who were killed in the First World War

A former army sergeant 'died of heat exhaustion' while paying his respects at a remote war memorial in Crete that he had hiked to in temperatures of 35C.

The body of 73-year-old Arthur Jones, an army cadet instructor, was found on Monday near a war memorial dedicated to the Greek cadets killed as they fought against the Nazi invasion.

His family added that it was 'very poignant' that he was discovered on 
the 100th anniversary of the outbreak of the First World War.

The grandfather, from Denbigh, North Wales  – described as a veteran 
adventurer by his family – went missing on June 19 after going into the 
Crete hills on the Greek holiday island.

He had sent his family a postcard in the first few days of his holiday, saying he was planning a walking trip.

He was last seen by staff at the resort in Chania where he was staying as he set out on what was to be the hottest day of the year in Crete - with temperatures reaching 35C.

The father-of-four had been been walking as a hobby for 30-40 years and 
had previously trained army cadets mountaineering and hill-climbing.

After a six-week air and land search led by the Greek Army, in which helicopters scoured the area near the resort where Mr Jones was last seen, his body was found slumped against a tree near the memorial.

His son Jeff, speaking from Crete, said: 'He was found near to this memorial, erected for the cadets which is something my dad was involved with for 30 years.

'He trained army cadets back in Wales. It’s extremely poignant for us.

'My father was obviously looking for this memorial and got lost either on the way there or back. It’s just a very nice last memory for us.

'It seems he passed away in a peaceful and dignified way. As far as we know, he’s been like that for six weeks. It was so hot, that day.'

His son said a post-mortem examination revealed no medical episode and it is presumed, based on the remote location and temperature, that he was dehydrated and suffered heat exhaustion.

The family has thanked the public and authorities for their support.

Jeff added: 'We as a family would like to thank everyone for their support, help and contribution to our quest in finding our father since he went missing six weeks ago.

'The last six weeks have been terribly stressful and difficult to cope with, but we would ask that we have the time, peace and privacy we need to mourn our father.'

Arthur’s daughter Angela Jones thanked the public for their 'incredible' support and said she took comfort from the fact her father, who was a keen walker, had been 'doing something he loves'.

The mother-of-two added: 'My father has been the best grandfather in the world - and it’s my two girls that it breaks my heart for. They are both under three and he’s been wonderful for them.

'The support we’ve had has been incredible - we couldn’t have asked for any more, it’s meant we have been able to keep going.'

Following the disappearance of the former army sergeant  June 19, the community of Denbigh united in support of the family and raised more than £20,000, which helped send a local search team out to the Mediterranean island.

Mr Jones family members also flew out to help with the search, with relatives bringing with them 1,000 leaflets in Greek and 
English, featuring the grandfather's picture, to hand out in the area.

People around the world got behind the #FindArthur and #CameronPromised campaigns on Twitter to show their support.
