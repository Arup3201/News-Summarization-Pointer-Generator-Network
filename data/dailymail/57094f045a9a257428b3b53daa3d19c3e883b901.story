Marco Reus could join Liverpool or Manchester United for just £19.8million after details of his release clause were leaked. 

The highly-rated Germany forward has Europe's top clubs circling after two successful years at Borussia Dortmund in the Bundesliga.

Liverpool are known admirers but it was widely believed that Reus would command a fee closer to £30m, pricing the Reds out of any move.

The clause becomes active next summer and German paper Bild has reported that interested clubs have been told he will be available for a knockdown fee.

Dortmund's domestic rivals Bayern Munich and Spanish giants Real Madrid have also been linked with the 25-year-old but the leak comes as a boost to Liverpool and their fierce rivals Manchester United.

New United manager Louis van Gaal is in the market for world-class new recruits as he embarks on his first season in English football.  

Reus rejoined Dortmund in 2012 from Borussia Monchengladbach after his hometown club released him as a 17-year-old. 

He scored 21 goals in 39 matches for Dortmund last season and offers creativity but missed Germany's triumphant World Cup campaign through injury.

Meanwhile, Reus believes Bayern will dominate Europe and the Bundesliga once again this season.

He has insisted Dortmund - who finished second, 19 points behind the Bavarians last term - must be more consistent if they are to keep up with the champions during the upcoming campaign.

Speaking to German sports magazine Kicker, Reus said: 'It will be all about Bayern Munich again in the Bundesliga, even if they weren't crowned champions in 2007 and 2011 the season after a World Cup. 

'As for Dortmund, we will have to ensure we don't drop as many points again as we did halfway through last season.'
