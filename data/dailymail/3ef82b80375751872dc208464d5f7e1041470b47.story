A delusional killer, who claimed he was told by a 'computer god' to strangle his girlfriend four years ago, will never face trial over her death because of his unfit mental state.

Rhys Blake Austin, then 22, admitting to killing 22-year-old mother Bianca Faith Girven in 2010 by strangling her for more than 10 minutes inside a van at Mt Gravatt, Brisbane.

The motivation for the attack, he said, was fueled by a belief that a computer god told him to kill his girlfriend so that he could too progress along the path of becoming a god. Austin, who has paranoid schizophrenia, also said he was on a 'mission to kill' before carrying out the attack.

Unsound of mind: Rhys Austin will not stand trial for killing his girlfriend back in 2010 

The admissions, made months after her death, lead a Mental Court Hearing to throw out the murder charge against him on the basis he exhibited severe psychotic symptoms.

The court found he was of unsound mind, accepted he was in a concealed delusional state and that there was a psychotic ­explanation for the killing.

The decision means Austin will not face trial over Ms Girven's murder, despite an unsuccessful appeal by the Attorney General's Department which argued his admissions proved he planned the murder.

The Court of Appeal heard Austin, who initially told police a false story, admitted to killing Ms Girven 14 months after her death on March 30, 2010 and nine months after his arrest.

They came after he initially told police the pair were in his van at a carpark near Mount Gravatt lookout when someone dragged Ms Girven from the vehicle and he was hit in the head.

Prosecutors alleged he told the psychiatrist how he had semi-planned the killing and thought he should strangle her. The Court of Appeal also heard he told how his hand hit her in the face and he went behind her and put her in a choke-hold for about 10 minutes, only releasing her when she stopped breathing.

Austin, then 22, panicked and drove her to his ­parents’ place.

The appeals court, however, upheld the initial ruling in the MHC ordering the proceedings against Austin be discontinued and no further taken against him for acts ­constituting that her Ms Girven's death.
