Victim: Emma Stones died in hospital following a catalogue of errors by medical staff who provided a level of care that was 'inadequate' and 'simply not acceptable', a coroner ruled

A coroner last night condemned a 
hospital after hearing a girl may have died in her bed and then been 
left by staff for so long she developed rigor mortis.

John Pollard said it was ‘simply not 
acceptable’ that Mike Stones, 59, should find his 12-year-old daughter 
Emma stiff and cold to the touch – despite being told by staff she had 
died minutes before.

An inquest heard that as well as not 
being given a blood test, Emma had not been monitored in the early hours
by nurses, who also failed to take her blood pressure.

Mr Pollard said the inadequate 
treatment Emma received played a part in her death from septicaemia at 
Tameside Hospital in Greater Manchester.

He added: ‘If the observations 
had been performed more accurately and the treatment had been instigated
at an earlier stage, the likelihood is that Emma would have survived.’

Last night her parents, Mr Stones and 
his wife Tracy Futcher, 42, said they were considering legal action 
against the hospital.

They added: ‘Something has to be wrong if this can
happen in an NHS hospital. We insist that lessons are learned for the 
wider NHS as well as Tameside and that people are held to account.

‘Emma was a lovely girl who we all 
loved very much. She deserved much better care than what she actually 
received.

'No child should be neglected in the way that Emma was, let 
alone a child with a mental handicap like Emma.’

The schoolgirl, who 
lived with her parents and twin sister Christina in Dukinfield, Greater 
Manchester, was taken to hospital on February 6, 2011, suffering from 
flu-like symptoms.

But hospital staff failed to diagnose a
bacterial infection because they were too busy to carry out basic blood
tests and neglected to check on her properly.

The hearing was told how Emma’s blood 
pressure was never taken as it should have been under hospital policy.

A
team of three nurses failed to monitor her regularly throughout the 
night – she should have been observed every four hours.

Emma’s father said that when they 
arrived at the hospital at 8.30am after being called there by staff, a 
doctor said: ‘Emma’s heart has just stopped, she has just died.’

But Mr Stones, who was Emma’s 
full-time carer, said she was already ‘stiff as a board’.

The coroner 
told them at the inquest in Stockport that nurses’ evidence suggested 
their daughter could have been dead or dying as early as 4.30am.

Tariq Mahmood, medical director at 
Tameside Hospital, said: ‘We acknowledge that the standard of care which
we gave Emma was not acceptable.’

Mr Pollard recorded a narrative verdict.
