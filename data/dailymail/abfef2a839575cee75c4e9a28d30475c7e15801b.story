Rescuing four people from a car crash might seem like a pretty heroic act, but Josh Romney, son of former presidential candidate Mitt, has received a large amount of flak since tweeting about his apparent heroics on Thanksgiving night.

Josh Romney, 38, posted a message to nearly 20,000 followers on Friday morning, complete with a goofy photo of him grinning in front of an overturned SUV and destroyed home in Salt Lake City.

The real estate developer has since received a large amount of online mockery after writing: 'Was first on scene to big accident, see pic of car in the house. I lifted 4 people out to safety. All ok. Thankful.'

Goofy: Romney was mocked after posting this photo of him grinning in front of a wrecked car and ruined house and accused of attempting a 'humblebrag'

Romney has upset the Twitter-verse by breaking one of the cardinal sins of the medium and using the situation to post a ‘humblebrag,’ a tweet which attempts to boast about something while at the same time trying to mask it as something altogether more self-effacing.

'Who tweets a pictures of themselves at the science of a car accident!?! Desperate for attention, much?', tweeted one critic, while another asked: 'Why are you smiling like a tourist at such a horrific scene?'

Two other commenters added 'Who but a member of the Romney family would pose for pictures, smiling, to brag about something like this?' and 'I can't figure out what's worse...the mangled car & destroyed home, or that smile at a car crash. Public safety is hilarious.'

For many it was Romney's use of the word ‘I’ in his tweet that made it such an obvious attempt at a ‘humblebrag.’

The phrase ‘humblebrag’, stems from the words humble and bragging and was first coined by American comedian Harris Wittels in 2011.

He subsequently set up the Twitter account @Humblebrag; to retweet what he considers the worst-offending 'humblebrags' mainly from celebrities.

A ‘humblebrag,’ is considered by many Twitter users to be an even worse offense than overt bragging, because the user is attempting to have it both ways – to tell everyone about something amazing that they’re doing, while also attempting to appear self-effacing and unpretentious.

The 'humblebrag' is not limited to celebrities and has become an all-too-familiar phenomenon that most people will have noticed friends and family posting on their Facebook feed or on Twitter. 

Here are some examples of terrible 'humblebrags':

Romney, who has been mentioned as a 
possible future political candidate in Utah, also posted the photo on 
Facebook where he received more than a hundred comments, many positive 
ones calling him a hero, but some saying things like ‘what a 
self-serving ghoul…’ and ‘no [sic] another Romney fabrication.’

Romeny’s exact role in the rescue has also been called into question by someone else who was at the scene.

Rick Gregor, a neighbor who heard the
 wreck and called 911, told KSL he didn't notice Romney because there 
were a lot of people on scene when the crash happened, and they were 
more focused on the people in the car than those helping them get out.

Romney's twitter account has been all quiet since he posted about the crash on Friday.

The Salt Lake Tribune
 reported that the vehicle left Interstate 215 on 4500 South and went 
straight through an intersection before smashing into the home, where no
 one was hurt.

Unified Police Lieutenant Justin Hoyal said that the accident had left the house 'unlivable.'

In a statement on Friday, Romney 
explained he was driving home with wife Jen and their three children 
after the family Thanksgiving dinner when he stopped at the 
intersection.

'Just then, a vehicle traveling at 
highway speed passed narrowly by my car, through the intersection and 
into the kitchen of a home across the street,' he said.

'I drove to the accident site and 
entered the home where the car had come to a stop on its side. I opened 
the car door and spoke with the four passengers inside the car.

'Miraculously, they appeared to have 
no major injuries. I was able to help each of them get out of the car 
and lift them down to the ground,' Romney added.

The second son of last year's 
presidential candidate said that he was grateful that no one was 
seriously injured, glad to have been able to help and he did what anyone
 else would have done in the same situation.

Police are still looking into the 
cause of the accident, but believe it may have been caused by the driver
 suffering a seizure while at the wheel.
