Prince Charles has said the number of British troops being injured daily in Afghanistan - where his youngest son Harry is currently serving his second tour of duty - is 'astonishing'.

The Prince of Wales said the public hears little about the number of British service personnel being wounded in Afghanistan and the 'horrific experiences' many soldiers are going through.

He made the comments as he opened a £16.9 million complex at the Defence Medical Rehabilitation Centre (DMRC) for wounded service personnel at Headley Court in Surrey, where green-fingered Charles enjoyed a tour of the gardens and even tried out some yoga stretches with patients.

The Prince of Wales said: 'So often people don't hear about the number of people who are wounded on a daily basis in Afghanistan.

'It is only when you visit the Queen Elizabeth Hospital (where battlefield casualties are repatriated to) or here that you realise how many people are going through such horrific experiences. It is astonishing.

'It makes me feel incredibly small and humble, what they have been through, what they go on to do and the inspiration they provide to others.'

Charles and the Duchess of Cornwall toured the facility before opening the £16.9 million, 48-bed Jubilee Rehabilitation Complex, which includes therapy rooms and a gym for rehabilitation of wounded soldiers and a workshop for hi-tech prosthetic limbs.

The couple met several ex-soldiers, including some who became members of the GB Paralympic squad which achieved so much at the London 2012 Paralympic Games.

They included discus thrower Derek Derenalagi, 37, who was pronounced dead when he lost both his legs following a Taliban bomb blast in Afghanistan in 2007.

He survived after a medic at Camp Bastion discovered he still had a pulse. It was while he was recuperating at Headley Court that he was watching the 2008 Paralympics in Beijing, and was inspired to take part in the London games.

Four years later, the former private in the Second Battalion the Mercian Regiment took his place in the Olympic Stadium to compete in the discus final at London 2012, finishing in 11th place.

He said Charles had congratulated him on his achievement at the games when they spoke.

'It is great to see him and Camilla supporting injured soldiers and coming to Headley Court to see the change you can make from being injured in the frontline to getting back to normal life again,' he said.

'It is inspiring.'

The royal couple also met sitting volleyball player Netra Rana, of the First Battalion Royal Gurka Rifles and Paralympic cyclist Terry Byrne, who both also benefited from the centre’s care after being wounded in Afghanistan.

They were joined by Paralympic triathlete Joe Townsend, who brought the flame into the stadium for the opening ceremony and who hopes to take part in the 2016 Rio de Janeiro Games, when his sport makes its debut.

They also met representatives of several charities which work with injured personnel.

Charles, known for his love of gardening and plants, also toured Headley Down’s gardens, which are maintained by service personnel, while Camilla toured the accommodation and met more injured servicemen and women.

They were both then shown the workshop where senior prosthetic technician Steve Lambert showed them a myoelectric arm, which uses electrical impulses in upper arm muscles to control and move a false hand.

Group Captain Clare Walton, the commanding officer of the DMRC, said the new facility would greatly help wounded personnel.

'What we have added here provides flexibility to those who are less mobile,' she said.

'I think it is a huge moral boost to know the public and the Royal Family care.

'It is essential to their rehabilitation to know that they are valued.'
