David Moyes drew his first Basque derby 1-1 in a hard-fought game at Anoeta. He saw his Real Sociedad take a third minute lead through top scorer Carlos Vela but they were pegged back in the second half and despite facing 10 men for the last 10 minutes had to settle for a point.

The start could not have been better for Moyes . He has been urging his full-backs to overlap even giving them the example of Leighton Baines to follow and when the goal came on three minutes it was a run from right-back Carlos Martinez that started the move.

He overlapped down the right and crossed for Alfred Finnbogason. The Icelandic striker made poor contact with his header but when the ball ran to the other flank Chory Castro jinked to the byline and crossed for Carlos Vela to head past Gorka Iraizoz.

Athletic could have doubled their lead on 11 mintues when Iñigo Martinez headed Xabi Prieto corner just wide. Athletic were struggling to contend with Carlos Vela and former Liverpool defender Mikel San Jose was booked for clattering the Mexican striker.

Vela was thrown up in the air again from a challenge with Mikel Balenziaga. He was a constant threat and had he, and not his strike partner Finnbogason, been on the end of Xabi Prieto’s cross moments later it would have been 2-0. The Icelandic is completely lacking in confidence and headed woefully wide.

Real Sociedad were not having it all their own way and Aritz Aduriz twice tested Eñaut Zubikarai. He also got down well to his right to save Susaeta free-kick but Athletic remained in the ascendancy until half time. Chory Castro shot was saved by Iraizoz and Vela had the whole of the Anoteta on their feet with a mazy run and shot that deserved a goal.

Athletic took the game to the home side in the second half but Real Sociedad were able to break quickly with the pass of Castro. He was fed by Xabi Prieto but when the cross came in again Finnbogason was unable to finish.

There was always a good chance that they were going to pay for such sloppy finishing and on the hour the equalizer came. Markel Susaeta sent a curling cross to the back post and right back Oscar de Marcos arrived with perfect timing and conviction to volley past Zubikarai.

La Real had not been the same side in the second side. Susaeta had time to measure his cross and De Marcos’ energy to meet the centre from his full-back position ahead of Real Sociedad full back Alberto de la Bella was also telling.

Moyes must have feared total capitulation just a week after his team conceded four in the second half against Villarreal but they were up against ten men from 79 minutes onwards when Athletic Bilbao centre-back Aymeric Laporte was sent off for a second yellow card. He elbowed Xabi Prieto as the both jumped for a header and deserved to go.

Real Sociedad almost took immediate advantage when a run from Castro forced a free-kick on the edge of the area and substitute Sergio Canales thundered it on to the bar. There was still time for Canales to squander another chance with a shot well saved by Iraizoz.

Derby games were never kind to Moyes in England. He lost his first one as Manchester United manager 4-1. This was an improvement on that – and against Champions League opponents – but he he will know with better finishing it could have been even better.
