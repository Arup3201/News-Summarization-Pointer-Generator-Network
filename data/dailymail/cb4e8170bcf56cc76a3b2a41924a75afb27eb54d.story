Journalists know better than anyone the influence social media has today, but it still doesn’t stop them getting into lots of bother for what they say on it.

The latest culprit is Fox Sports AFL reporter Julian de Stoop whose Twitter comment comparing Sat Navs and women generated a huge backlash on Tuesday.

Twitter followers smashed De Stoop for saying: ‘Given women generally women struggle to read maps it’s a little ironic the voice on the Sat Nav given (sic) directions is a women.’ A hashtag saying ‘confused’ was attached.

It was all supposed to be a bit of harmless banter on Twitter but Fox Sports AFL reporter Julian de Stoop soon found himself in hot water

Mr De Stoop joked about women's voices being used in Sat Navs it did not go down well

Match Review Panel felt de Stoop should use a self monitoring compass

Alan Baaff wondered out loud who would be the AFL journalist to replace him?

If he wanted a response he got one as Twitter followers lined up to give him stick. 

One with the Twitter name of Match Review Panel said: 'Julian, Julian, Julian... have you no self monitoring compass? We'll be back to you with your sanction.'

'Where will they find a spare AFL journo (sic) to replace him?' Alan Bamff tweeted.  

Nat said: 'i'm sorry what is the joke here? Is it 'women are stupid'? Is that your joke? Is that what you are saying?'

Mr De Stoop tries to set the record straight and show that he was only joking

Unfortunately Nat still can't work out what was so funny in the first place 

As far as Erin Riley was concerned it was just the same old story

An incredulous Nat later continued: 'i don't understand why this is funny. Could you explain it to me?'

Erin Riley was more to the point saying: 'Another day, another sports journalist being a sexist d***head.'

Mr De Stoop then tried to justify his actions by tweeting: ‘To those who clearly didn’t understand that tweet about the sat nav it was TONGUE IN CHEEK.’ Adding the hashtag ‘nannystate’ to reinforce the point probably didn't help.

The 34-year-old did his best to defuse the situation after more criticism of his comments on Twitter 

Mr De Stoop removed the two tweets and apologised for any offensive he may have caused 

But the responses still kept coming and before long the thread had been taken down.

'Previous two tweets have been removed. They were insensitive and didn't come across as I intended. Apologies to anyone that was offended,' De Stoop tweeted. 

The Daily Mail Australia tried to get in touch with Mr De Stoop, but he could not be contacted for a response.  

The 34-year-old has been a sports reporter with Fox Sports since November 2006.
