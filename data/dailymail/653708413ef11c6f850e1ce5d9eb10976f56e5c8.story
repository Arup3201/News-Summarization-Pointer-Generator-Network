A family of beavers is to continue living free on a Devon river, officials have ruled.

Ministers wanted the remarkable animals, believed to be the first wild beavers to breed in England for 800 years, to be rounded up and put in a zoo after they were spotted last year.

But Natural England, the government agency in charge of wildlife, has decided they will instead be allowed to stay in the wild and be carefully monitored in the first project of its kind.

Beavers won't be budging: A family of beavers is to continue living free on a Devon river after Natural England, the government agency in charge of wildlife, has decided they won't be put in a zoo, but will instead be allowed to stay in the wild and be carefully monitored in the first project of its kind

Devon Wildlife Trust, which will run the pilot project for the next five years, welcomed the decision as a ‘great day for conservation in England’.

There are at least ten beavers thriving along a 12mile (19km) stretch of the River Otter near Exeter.

They have been quietly living and breeding there for at least five years, completely unnoticed until just over a year ago.

It is an extraordinary environmental success story, for which green groups and conservationists can take no credit.

Nobody knows where they came from – but they are certainly thriving without any outside interference.

So environmentalists were furious when Defra, the Government’s environment department, decided last year that they would round up the beavers.

Peter Burgess of the Devon Wildlife Trust said the beavers could have a hugely beneficial impact on rivers, reducing numbers of trees on the banks, improving light levels, and reducing flood risk by controlling water flow with their dams.

Some people think they may slow down flood waters, as well as boosting wildlife diversity.

Farmers and anglers have that they can damage the landscape and fish migration routes.

Officials said that they posed a risk to other wildlife, and might spread parasites and disease.

They ordered the beavers to be caged and either rehomed or culled, prompting a fierce campaign to allow the animals to remain free, backed by more than 12,000 people.

The threat of a zoo or worse has now been averted.

The beavers will be carefully tested for disease this spring and, as long as they are free of disease, will be allowed to stay on the River Otter.

Tom Buckley, a retired environmental scientist who spotted the first beaver on the banks of the River Otter a year ago, said: ‘I am very grateful to all those people who have given their support to saving our beavers.

‘Currently there are few signs of the beaver on the river Otter, no dams or lodges, but beaver can do such a lot more to help improve the environment and now they have been given the chance, I'm looking forward very much to helping them show people just what they can do.’

But he said the Animal and Plant Health Agency must be very careful when they trap the beavers to test them for diseases in the coming weeks.

He said: ‘There is still grave concerns regarding trapping the beavers, including the significant risk of drowning them and ensuring the safety of the kits who still rely on their parents for their survival.

‘None of the Animal and Plant Health Agency people licenced to trap the beavers have direct beaver skills or experience.’

Beavers, which are native to England, were plentiful in our countryside until they were wiped out by hunters in the Middle Ages.

They vanished from our rivers and wetlands for centuries until, mysteriously, one was spotted near Ottery St Mary in eastern Devon last winter.

A few months later a second beaver was seen and then grainy pictures emerged in the spring of a juvenile.

The Daily Mail revealed in November that there are three generations living on the River Otter, with at least ten individuals.

‘Natural England has very carefully considered the Devon Wildlife Trust application against international standards, and has decided that a licence will be issued permitting the managed release into the wild of beavers currently resident in the River Otter, on a five year trial basis,' a Defra spokesman said.

'This decision is subject to the beavers being tested and found to be free of Echinococcus multilocularis parasite.

‘Our priority is to ensure humane treatment for the beavers while safeguarding human health, that’s why we will be working with the Devon Wildlife Trust to capture and test the animals before the trial begins.’

This proves that they have been quietly prospering and – crucially – breeding.

Experts think they must have been there for at least five years, unnoticed.

As well as being a rare victory for native English wildlife, conservationists say beavers directly benefit the environment.

Peter Burgess of the Devon Wildlife Trust said the beavers could have a hugely beneficial impact on rivers, reducing numbers of trees on the banks, improving light levels, and reducing flood risk by controlling water flow with their dams.

He said: ‘We are really pleased that we have obtained this step forward.

‘It is a really important day for conservation in England, a really great day for conservation in England. We are looking forward to making this trial a success.’

Andrew Sells, Natural England chairman, whose board agreed to give Devon Wildlife Trust the licence for the project, said: ‘Reintroduction of a species is a complicated and emotive subject and we have considered this application very carefully.

‘We are now satisfied with Devon Wildlife Trust’s plans for managing and monitoring the project, which will allow important evidence to be gathered during the trial on any impacts which the beavers may have.’

Beavers normally live in family groups and can survive up to 24 years in the wild and 35 years in captivity.

They are herbivorous rodents that build corridors in their dams to escape predators such as wolves and bears in the wild.

The animals are nocturnal and can grow to more than 3ft, weigh up to 70lbs, and feed on a diet of reeds, leaves and bark.

Beavers were hunted almost to extinction in Europe, both for fur and for castoreum - a secretion of its scent gland for medicinal properties.

The beavers’ presence in Devon remains a mystery. There are several captive breeding programmes in the UK, including thirty miles away in western Devon, on the other side of Dartmoor. But none of the animals is unaccounted for.

Other explanations touted by locals include their escape from a private collection, or a deliberate release by wildlife fanatics.

There is a slim chance they travelled from Scotland, where they have been successfully reintroduced on several rivers, or even from Europe, where there are a greater number of reintroduction programmes.

Conservationists welcomed today’s decision, but not everyone will be happy.

Farmers and anglers have raised concerns that they can damage the landscape and fish migration routes, and said conservation efforts should be focused on the UK’s existing wildlife.

Clinton Devon Estates, which owns part of the land where the beavers are living, welcomed the decision but warned of the need to manage problems and compensate people whose livelihoods are damaged.

Sam Bridgewater, nature conservation manager for Clinton Devon Estates, said: ‘If their numbers increase, then it is inevitable that they will eventually start to engineer their local environment.

‘This will bring all kinds of benefits such as a potential slowing down of flood waters and an increase in the diversity of wildlife habitats, but will also likely cause some grief.

‘We very happy to work with other parties such as Natural England and the Devon Wildlife Trust to ensure this trial is a success.’

Harry Barton, chief executive of Devon Wildlife Trust, said: ‘This is an historic moment. The beavers of the River Otter are the first breeding population in the English countryside for hundreds of years.

‘We believe they can play a positive role in the landscapes of the 21st century through their ability to restore our rivers to their former glories.

‘We know from our own research and research done in Europe that beavers are excellent aquatic-engineers improving the flood and drought resilience of our countryside and increasing the water quality of our rivers.’

Friends of the Earth campaigner Alasdair Cameron, said: ‘If, as seems likely, they can now remain in the wild, it will be a major victory for common sense and everyone who has campaigned on their behalf.

‘Beavers add to Britain’s rich natural heritage and can bring huge benefits to the local environment, such as boosting wildlife and reducing flooding risks.’
