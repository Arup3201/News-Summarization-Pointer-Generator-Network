Bookmaker William Hill today threatened to close more than 100 shops after George Osborne’s tax raid on high stakes betting machines.

The Chancellor stunned the industry in last month’s Budget when he increased duty on Fixed Odds Betting Terminals, dubbed the ‘crack cocaine’ of gambling.

The increase means 109 loss-making William Hill shops will never make money and have to shut, the firm said.

Mr Osborne said the mega-jackpot machines were ‘highly lucrative’ and hiked  the levy on them from 20 per cent to 25 per cent.

The Mail has campaigned against the machines, which are found in high street betting shops and allow users to lose up to £100 per spin.

Critics say they are highly addictive and make casino-style gambling accessible on the high street.

But William Hill said the duty increase made it unlikely that dozens of its shops, most of which are loss-making, can be successfully turned around.

The company has already warned that tax rise will cost it around £22 million a year.

Shares in William Hill and Ladbrokes have fallen sharply in the wake of last month's tax raid, which the industry called ‘knee-jerk and ill-considered’.

In a trading statement today, William Hill chief executive Ralph Topping described the shop closures as ‘particularly disappointing’.

He added: ‘Through the economic downturn, we have worked hard to grow our retail base but this further planned increase in indirect taxation makes this action necessary.’

The closures would put 420 jobs at risk and result in exceptional costs of up to 24 million pounds, it said.

William Hill also said operating profit had fallen by 14 percent in the first quarter of 2014, hit by big payouts to gamblers on two weekends on which many top soccer sides had won.

But the group is hoping heavy betting on the soccer World Cup in June and July will help to offset the first-quarter problems.

‘While there is no guarantee we can make up the difference, we continue to believe the increased customer confidence from such wins should be good for business, especially in this World Cup year,’ Mr Topping said.

In the Budget, Mr Osborne said: ‘Fixed-odds betting terminals have proliferated since gambling laws were liberalised almost a decade ago. These machines are highly  lucrative and therefore it’s right we now raise the duty on them to 25 per cent.’

Britain’s 33,000 FOBTs have been under mounting scrutiny in recent months – with the Mail leading campaigns to highlight their dangers.

The machines allow players to stake up to £100 a time on a 20-second spin of a wheel for games such as virtual roulette.
