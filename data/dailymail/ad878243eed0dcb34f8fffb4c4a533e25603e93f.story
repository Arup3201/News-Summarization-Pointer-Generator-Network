Privatisation: Nigel Farage was filmed during a 2012 tour telling supporters he believed the private sector offered better value for money than the NHS

Nigel Farage is facing claims he backs the privatisation of the NHS after he was caught on camera calling for a switch to a U.S.-style insurance-based healthcare system.

In footage that has only just come to light, the Ukip leader was filmed during a 2012 tour telling supporters he believed the private sector offered better value for money.

The rediscovery of Mr Farage's remarks will be a blow to Ukip as it tries to reposition itself as a party committed to following public opinion which is staunchly pro-NHS.

It comes as he sensationally declared he would be prepared to prop up a Labour minority government if he could secure an agreement on a referendum on the UK's membership of the European Union.

In an interview with the New Statesman Mr Farage declared that he would be ‘very comfortable supporting anybody that gave me an opportunity to get my country back’.

The Tories immediately seized on his remarks, with a spokesman declaring that they showed that a vote for Ukip would lead to Labour winning in May next year. But just as damaging to his standing with voters on the left is Mr Farage's remarks on reforming the NHS.

In footage shot during his 2012 Common Sense tour and obtained by the Guardian, Mr Farage said: 'I think we're going to have to think about healthcare very, very differently. I think we're going to have to move to an insurance-based system of healthcare.

'Frankly I would feel more comfortable that my money would return value if I was able to do that through the market place of an insurance company than just us trustingly giving £100bn a year to central government and expecting them to organise the healthcare service from cradle to grave for us.'

A Ukip spokesman told The Times its policy had changed since Mr Farage's remarks. He said: 'Ukip believes our healthcare must remain free at the point of access.

'Previous governments have enabled huge chunks of the NHS to be privatised by the back door and it simply has not worked.'

'Ukip believes in seeking new ideas to ensure the NHS provides the highest quality of care,' he added.

Sacred cow: A Ukip spokesman insisted that its policy had changed since Mr Farage's remarks and that the party was now committed to a healthcare service that remains free at the point of use

In the New Statesman interview, Mr Farage was asked by the publication’s editor Jason Cowley about the possibility of a deal were the party to secure eight to ten MPs at the next election, and whether they would join Labour in a coalition in return for an ‘in-out referendum’.

A councillor who switched allegiance to Ukip has resigned as a school’s chairman of governors after the headteacher allegedly asked him to quit over his political views,writes Chris Brooke.

Mike Ward, 71, has been a governor of the secondary school for eight years and never had a problem during his time as an independent councillor on Scarborough Borough Council.

But five weeks after announcing he was joining Ukip Mr Ward was called in for a meeting by Sue Whelan, head of Eskdale School, and told he should leave his role because the party’s policies were ‘against the ethos of the school.’

She expressed concern about a news report concerning party policy on immigrants not being entitled to benefits or state education when they arrive in the country. The school has one immigrant family, he said.

Father-of-two Mr Ward, a former teacher and retired marketing director, said he was ‘astonished’ and ‘upset’, but resigned as head of governors because he ‘didn’t wish to cause the school any further issues.’ 

Last night UKIP leader Nigel Farage said: ‘Mike is a decent and honourable man who has always had the interests of the School and the wider community at the forefront of his mind and it is absolutely disgraceful that he has been treated in this way.

‘This is discrimination pure and simple and I find it astounding that the head teacher has taken it upon herself to oust him. Questions need to be asked about why this has happened. In the meantime I stand with Mike and I can only hope the School sees sense and reinstates him.’ 

He said: ‘That would depend when the referendum was, and the terms.’

Declaring he was not ruling out a deal he added: ‘There is no left and right any more. Left and right’s irrelevant.’

Pressed on the issue, he said a Ukip-Labour-Lib Dem coalition was ‘extremely unlikely’.

He appeared to indicate he would be reluctant to join a formal coalition, but said he ‘absolutely’ would consider a so-called ‘confidence and supply’ deal.

Under such an arrangement minor parties would agree to vote for the government’s budget, any confidence motions and other key legislation in return for deals on other policy areas.

Mr Farage said: ‘To be honest, the way I look at it now, I can’t see Ukip wilfully going into formal coalition with anybody.

Asked directly if he’d be ‘comfortable supporting Labour’, he replied: ‘I’d be very comfortable supporting anybody that gave me an opportunity to get my country back.’

The Conservatives have promised a referendum on UK membership of the EU in 2017. Labour has ruled out a vote unless more powers are transferred to Brussels.

In his Tory Party conference speech David Cameron argued that a vote for Nigel Farage would help Ed Miliband get into Downing Street.

He told his party that ‘you could go to bed with Nigel Farage, and wake up with Ed Miliband’.

Last night a Conservative spokesman said: ‘This is further proof – from the horse’s mouth – that a vote for Nigel Farage will deliver Ed Miliband in Downing Street. That means a return to more spending, more borrowing and more tax.’

A Labour Party spokesman refused to speculate on any deals, insisting: ‘Labour is aiming for victory and a majority Labour government at the next general election.’

Senior Labour sources insisted that ‘hell would freeze over first’ before Labour did a deal with Ukip.
