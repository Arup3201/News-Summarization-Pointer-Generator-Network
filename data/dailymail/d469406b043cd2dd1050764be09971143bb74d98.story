It may have been a relatively mild winter so far, but several Tottenham players couldn't escape the cold as they prepared to aid their recovery in a freezing ice chamber after training.

The four Spurs stars, Andros Townsend, Kyle Walker, Christian Eriksen and Jan Vertonghen, lined up wearing only shorts, socks, woolen hats and face masks as they nervously awaited the treatment on Friday.

And, with temperatures in the so-called kriotherapy chamber ranging from -130C and - 140C, they had every reason to be apprehensive ahead of the three minutes they will spend in a small room cooled by liquid nitrogen.

Developed in 1978 by Toshiro Yamauchi in Japan, the process, which has been used by Spurs players including Rafel van der Vaart and Jermain Defoe in the past, aids recovery by stimulating the body to keep warm in extreme cold temperatures.

Upon leaving the chamber, the players' veins will open to around three to four times bigger than normal, increasing the blood supply and bringing more oxygen to infected areas.

Kriotherapy provides a change of routine for injured athletes. It can trigger the release of endorphins that help combat any psychological malaise. It's also good for the skin, helps osteoporosis and can ease long-term complaints such as MS or ME. Men's testosterone levels increase afterwards, too. 

Head of sports science at  Manchester City (and formerly with Spurs), Dr Sam Erith, has said: 'Kriotherapy means you can train more, to get fitter more quickly. With the players who have been rehabilitating, they've been training three times a day.'

Shock hits you when you walk through the door into a temperature of -135C (-211 F). It is not like plunging into a cold pool because the air is dry and the impact is instant. The cold doesn’t engulf you gradually; it takes your breath away and attacks you from all sides.

You cannot imagine how cold it is going to be. My hands, clenched into tight fists and covered by three pairs of gloves, went straight to my back and stomach, trying to cover the most exposed areas. I felt a rush of adrenaline and an instant buzz.

Then we — myself, Spurs physician Dr Shabaaz Mughal and kit man James Campbell — began to walk, heads down, in a circle, stomping our feet. It was like being in a misty, bitingly cold tunnel, but without the faintest gust of wind. I suddenly became aware of every inch of my skin.

I thought it would feel like an eternity, but three minutes had passed before we knew it.

Suddenly we were back in the antechamber and then at room temperature, about 20C (68F), bright red and flushed with a remarkable sense of achievement. Renata puts me straight on to the Vibrogym equipment, making me change position so the pulses can stimulate the blood flow to my muscles.

You warm up in no time. My high continued for the next hour or so, then died off, leaving me feeling pleasantly sleepy.
