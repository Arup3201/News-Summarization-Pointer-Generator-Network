A city has been forced to scrap its controversial 'Moroccan bazaar' Christmas market after immigration chiefs refused to let the north African traders into the country.

Residents in Stoke-on-Trent, Staffordshire, had already voiced their anger that 'Kasbah' stalls from the 99 per cent Muslim country would not fit with the spirit of Christmas.

And there were more complaints on Thursday when a caravan of Moroccan camels missed the city's 'switch-on' event because the vehicle carrying them got stuck behind an accident on the M6.

Now the three-week market has been cancelled altogether, Stoke-on-Trent City Council has admitted - with no time to arrange a replacement.

However, the reality was decidedly more British when Stoke (pictured) was told the traders were refused visas

The market was also due to travel to Leeds and Peterborough, Cambridgeshire.

Labour-run Stoke-on-Trent City Council started talks with 
the market's organisers in June, met them twice and received 
documents, including insurance details and a list of traders, ahead of 
their planned arrival last Tuesday.

The first sign of trouble, however, came last week when the council was warned the traders would not arrive until Friday December 6.

Organisers vowed it would still go ahead as soon as immigration officers cleared the 40 'artisan' traders for entry.

But council officials now admit there were 'unforeseen problems' with the issuing of visas.

City Centre Partnership chairman Doug Wardle said: 'This is very disappointing all round. I was really looking forward to going.'

Shopper Jane Richards, 34, added: 'A lot of people will have made plans to go to the market so they will be annoyed to find it's not on.

'Everyone has been making a really big deal about it so it's embarrassing for it to be cancelled.'

Many residents, however, had been sceptical about whether the market would have succeeded.

Labourer Dennis Havers, 55, said: 'It's a joke really. I'm sure my grandkids will love a camel ride but it is a bonkers idea.

'I like to go to these markets to feel Christmassy but I can't see how a Moroccan rug is going to make me think about Jesus or the nativity.'

Stoke-on-Trent was not the only city affected. The market was also due to visit Leeds and Peterborough

Part-time secretary Sue Hildreth, 62, added: 'It is outrageous. We all know Morocco is a Muslim country so it maybe classed as "festive" I suppose but it won't be celebrating Christmas will it?'

And Office worker Simon Tovey, 22, said: 'I couldn't believe it when I read about the market. At least the German markets feel wintry and festive.'

Cllr Adrian Knapper, cabinet member for health and wellbeing, said: 'We're very disappointed they have told us the traders are not coming.

'If the market had traded we would have made a profit of around Â£2,000 but there has been no other expense to the council.

'We are not able to provide an alternative market but we still have two Thursday night late-night shopping events in the city centre which are packed full of family-friendly entertainment and will go-ahead as planned.'

The market organisers were unavailable for comment yesterday.
