Thieves have tunnelled their way into a toy shop and stolen thousands of dollars worth of cash and remote control cars, helicopters and trains.

The robbers tried to cover their tracks by throwing around corrosive bleach, which ruined even more toys just days before Christmas.

A hole was cut in the wall of the Toyworld store in Moonah, north of Hobart, on Friday night or early Saturday and thieves took off with $7,000 worth of expensive electrical toys and a safe with $1,000 in it.

Owner Samm Harrington, who now won't be able to open his shop ahead of Christmas, suspects the shop was scoped by thieves for weeks before the robbery, the ABC reports.

'They'd tunnelled their way through, they jumped the fence, they ripped the wooden palings off the outside of the shop and smashed their way through,' Mr Harrington said.

'We're probably going to be losing up to about $12,000 to $15,000 in trading dollars and we know we've lost at least $7,000 in stock.'

Mr Harrington has handed police CCTV footage from the store, which shows a man spending a fair bit of time in that specific room on Thursday.

'He then came back on Friday, walked around, went into that room again and then decided to buy a $2 Hot Wheels car just to make sure he was purchasing something so he didn't get totally sussed out,' he said.

Additional stock will have to be thrown out following the robbery after thieves doused them in bleach to try and cover their tracks.

Mr Harrington said he will not be renewing the lease at the premises as a result of the robbery. 

Police are still investigating.
