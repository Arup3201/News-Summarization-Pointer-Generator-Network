Everton look set to be frustrated in a last-ditch attempt to sign Stoke City captain Ryan Shawcross.

Roberto Martinez made a late enquiry for the 26-year-old defender after watching his side conceded six against Chelsea.

But Everton can only offer up to £8million for Shawcross and Stoke will not sell for that price.

Target: Everton were interested in Ryan Shawcross but haven't got enough money for the Stoke captain

Dismantled: Chelsea struck six past a poor Everton defence in the Premier League on Saturday

Shawcross, who signed from Manchester United in 2008, has made over 200 Premier League appearances for the Potters.

Phil Jagielka and Sylvain Distin are the current first choice pairing for the Toffees, while John Stones is a promising deputy.

But Everton fans were made to worry  when Chelsea cause havoc at the back on Saturday.
