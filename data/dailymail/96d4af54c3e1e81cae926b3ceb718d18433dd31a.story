Anders Iniesta says he has fulfilled a 'lifelong dream' after being appointed Barcelona's new manager by manager Luis Enrique.

Carles Puyol retired this summer after 10 years as Barcelona captain. Ironically, Puyol became captain after Luis Enrique retired from playing at the end of the 2003/04 season.

Speaking to Marca about his new role, Iniesta said: 'Moments like these make you feel both proud and happy.

'For those of us who've been in the first-team for a long time and come through the ranks at the club, captaining the first-team is a lifelong dream, another step in your career, proof that you're still improving as a player, although on the flip-side, it means you're getting older.'

Victor Valdes, who had been the vice-captain, also left Barcelona this season after spending his entire career at the club. Xavi, the club's record appearance holder was another option for the Catalan club but with his career winding down Iniesta appears a longer-term solution.

Luis Enrique's Barcelona promise to be a different animal to that of the last few years, with considerable upheaval in terms of squad members. But the 30-year-old Iniesta admitted he was looking forward to being part of it.

'The truth is that I'm really happy to be part of this squad,' said the Spain international. 'The experiences you go through, not just on the pitch, but on a personal level, toughen you up.

'They make you a better person and a better player.'
