Hugo Lloris has offered his backing to under-fire Tottenham boss Mauricio Pochettino and insists the players must take responsibility for their performances.

Tottenham suffered their fourth loss in six games at White Hart Lane when they slumped to a 2-1 defeat to Stoke.

Lloris believes Spurs have become too comfortable and need to change things quickly.

Mauricio Pochettino has been under pressure at Tottenham after four defeats in six games at White Hart Lane

The French international insists he has no regrets about staying in North London and does not blame Pochettino for Tottenham's current failings.

'When it's the third coach in one year and there are problems, the coach is not necessarily the problem. We've been working though, trying to find solutions,' Lloris told L'Equipe.

'I've known times like this at Lyon but, there, there was a real pressure every day and there was crisis management. In London, we're a bit more on our own, comfortable. We have to get out [of this comfort] because, if we ever have to fight against relegation, being comfortable won't help us.

'It really bothers me [that the coach is being blamed].'
