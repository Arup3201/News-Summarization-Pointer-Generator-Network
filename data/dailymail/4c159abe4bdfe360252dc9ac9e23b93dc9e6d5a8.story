Sometimes a bargain can be too good to be true.

But frying pans that appeared online for the price of £0.00 were the exception to the rule after the company selling them gave hundreds away for free.

A computer glitch at ProCook, based in Gloucester, led to the pricing blunder for the non-stick Fusion pans which normally sell for £18.

Cookware company ProCook gave away 600 frying pans after incorrectly advertising them online for £0.00

Word about the amazing offer spread quickly online and between last Friday night and Saturday afternoon six hundred customers placed orders, some ordering as many as forty pans.

Retailing at £18 each, the multiple orders would have cost ProCook £50,000 to honour but the company decided to send each customer who ordered during the glitch one pan as a gesture of goodwill.

Company spokeswoman Sarah Savory-Smith said: ‘We were not legally bound to supply the pans for nothing but we have decided to send one pan to each person who ordered them as a gesture of goodwill.

‘Some people tried to order more than one, in one case there was an order for forty but we are certainly not doing that.

‘We don’t yet know how this error occurred. Suddenly on Friday night the price of these pans went down to zero. 

Tesco in particular has been badly hit by price glitch mistakes in the past.

Just before Christmas last year a glitch at the chain's tills meant 
shoppers could buy Terry's Chocolate Oranges for just 29p – a saving of 
almost 90 per cent on the list price of £2.75.

The mix-up happened because tills couldn't handle two simultaneous 
promotions on the chocolates – a three-for-£5 offer and a 
buy-one-get-one-free deal.

Earlier that year, Tesco suffered yet again for a till blunder in June 
2011, when customers were walking away with 24 cans or bottles of 
leading brands of lager for only £4.

The promotion was supposed to offer a saving of £4 on two cases of 12 
drinks such as Carling, Fosters and  Budweiser, which normally sell for a
 total of £20.

But when shoppers reached the till, they were being charged only £4 instead of £16.

And Tesco, again, earlier that month was caught out on another beer deal glitch.

A deal offering three boxes of various alcoholic drinks for £20 was going through the tills at three for £11.

‘Luckily some of our staff were very vigilant and noticed this quickly on Saturday and were able to put it right.

‘The 28cm Fusion pan is one of our most 
popular products and news about this apparent giveaway offer spread 
amazingly quickly across the world thanks to various bloggers.’

An online petition of angry customers helped force M&S to honour orders for Panasonic 50 inch 3D plasma televisions after shoppers snapped up the sets for just £199 following a pricing blunder earlier this year.

High street giant Next has been left red-faced after listing a pair of sofas worth £1,198 on its website for just £98.

Online shoppers were delighted when they discovered the blunder, which reduced the cost of the sofas by £1,100 instead of the intended £100.

But the retailer fell back on small print in its terms and conditions which it says allows it to cancel orders before they are dispatched for delivery.

Next was quick to spot the error and corrected the price after just a few hours in January this year. 

Amazon was once blitzed by bargain hunters after it mistakenly priced music album downloads for 29p in 2009. 

Many customers, tipped off by consumer websites, bought scores of downloads before Amazon realised it was selling entire albums for less than the price of some of its singles. 

It is understood that more than 30 different albums were priced at 29p for four hours.
