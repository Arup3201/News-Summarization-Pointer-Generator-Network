The mother of an  Indonesian transgender woman who was killed and dismembered by her Australian husband says her eldest child was a 'kind and cheerful' person. 

Mayang Prasetyo, 27, is believed to have died at the hands of Marcus Volke, 28, who took his own life shortly after police found the woman's remains boiling on the stove in their inner-city Brisbane unit on Saturday.

Her mother, Nining Sukarni, only spoke to her eldest child, who she refers to as her son Febri, last Thursday from her Indonesian home.

Body parts belonging to Mayang Prasetyo, 27, were found strewn across the inner-city Brisbane apartment she shared with her Australian husband Marcus Volke on Saturday

'He was a kind person, cheerful, warm to people, effervescent, always going from here to there,' Ms Nining told AAP. 

She said Ms Prasetyo was restless in Brisbane having moved there to be with her husband, Marcus Volke, after meeting while working on a cruiseship.

Ms Nining said she told her daughter not to fight with Volke.

'Our last communication was a week before the incident. She was just fine so I still don't believe it,' Ms Nining told Nine News.

Her mother, Nining Sukarni, spoke to her eldest child, who she refers to as her son Febri, last week before she was found dead

Ms Prasetyo, pictured here in white before undergoing breast and facial surgery in 2009, grew up as a 'normal boy' before heading overseas, according to Ms Nining

She worked as as transgender escort in Australia and sent her earnings back home to Indonesia to support her single mother and two younger sisters

'She would always tell me if something was happening to her. I wasn't suspicious because she didn't tell me bad things were happening to her.'

Ms Nining said Ms Prasetyo sought her blessing before she married Volke abroad in 2013, and the couple had visited her home in Bandar Lampung, Sumatra, last year.

She was stunned by the crime, believing Volke to be 'kind, polite'.

Ms Mayang, who is said to have begun gender reassignment therapy in 2009, worked as as transgender escort in Australia and sent her earnings back home to Indonesia to support her single mother and two younger sisters.

It has been revealed Volke was also working in the sex industry having secretly worked as a male prostitute

She was the backbone of the family having paid for her sisters, aged 18 and 15, to be educated.

Ms Nining told tribunnews.com that Ms Prasetyo adored celebrities, particularly Indonesian soap star-turned-politician Krisna Mukti, and dreamed of becoming 'rich and famous'.

She had named herself Mayang after Indonesian singer Mayang Sari, and Prasetyo after a previous boyfriend, she told kompas.com.

Until graduating high school in 2005, Ms Nining said her eldest 'grew up as a normal boy' before travelling abroad.

Before going by the name Mayang Prasetyo, the 27-year-old was known as Febri Andriansyah as shown on her Indonesian passport

Her mother described the 27-year-old as a kind and cheerful person who was always travelling

Ms Prasetyo's family say while she grew up as a boy, she always identified as a girl from a young age

But he is believed to have identified as a girl from a young age with one of the sisters, Gebi, telling Indonesia's SCTV: 'Since he was little, he would usually hang out with girls.'

Ms Prasetyo, who was a pre-operation transsexual, was just months away from becoming a woman anatomically. 

Ms Nining said she hoped her child's remains could be repatriated for burial in Indonesia as a prayer service was held in Bali on Tuesday night.

'We never expected she would end up like this, and that her boyfriend would have the heart to do that,' her friend Albert said. 

Ms Nining said Ms Prasetyo sought her blessing before she married Volke abroad in 2013, and the couple had visited her home in Bandar Lampung, Sumatra, last year
