Mayor Rob Ford proudly marched through the streets of Toronto Tuesday to celebrate Canada Day, drawing a mix of cheers and jeers from the crowd.

Ford's public appearance Tuesday came just one day after he returned to work upon completing two months at a rehabilitation center where he received treatment for his well-documented alcohol addiction.

Sporting a burgundy shirt and a red-and-white lei around his neck, the jovial mayor attended the East York Canada Day parade, where he chatted up passersby and handed magnets and small ‘Ford Nation’ flags.

Looking relaxed and about 70lbs slimmer, the 45-year-old politician disregarded hecklers who greeted him with loud boos and taunts of 'resign’ and 'you’re a disgrace.’

Canada.com's correspondent Rob Granatstein reported hearing one man yell at the troubled mayor: 'You're the gravy train, Rob' while another shouted, 'You're gonna ruin our parade.' 

Ford's political opponent John Tory referred to the incumbent, whom he is hoping to unseat in October, as 'the circus.'

By all appearances, Mr Ford did not let the naysayers ruin his upbeat mood.

He tweeted a photo of himself holding a giant Canadian flag while marching with the National Congress of Chinese Canadians. 

Granatstein said that despite the verbal abuse Ford was subjected to while marching in the parade, many people were eager to have their picture taken with the infamous Canadian, who has become known around the world as the crack-smoking mayor of Toronto.

But some residents of the East York neighborhood were put out by Ford's presence on the parade route.

‘It’s a travesty to have him in the East York parade… I just don’t think I can stand here and not say something against his presence,’ Elinor Mahoney told National Post.

Mayoral candidates John Tory and Olivia Chow called Ford out over his refusal to answer questions posed to him by members of the Canadian press.

Ford's brother, Doug, was quick to come to his sibling’s defense, insisting that he will sit down with reporters for in-depth interviews in due time.

On his [part, Mayor Ford kept mum about his recent struggles and his future in politics.

‘I’m just going to talk about Canada Day today. It’s all about Canada Day I just want to meet the people, I’ll be happy to talk to you guys later,’ Ford was quoted as saying by Global News.

The mayor got a standing ovation when he took the stage at the CHIN Picnic at Exhibition place in the afternoon, with some onlookers remarking on his leaner appearance. 

Ford was accompanied by his young son, and many parents in the crowd clamoured to have their own kids pose for pictures with the mayor.

On Monday, Mayor Ford marked his return to public life with an emotional speech in which he credited rehab with saving his life.

The beleaguered politician apologized for his previous outbursts and drug use, and said he took full responsibility for his actions.

'Like a lot of people dealing with substance abuse, I was in complete denial,' he said at the press conference at City Hall. 'But soon it became obvious that my alcohol and drug use was having a serious impact on my family and on my health and on my job as mayor.

'After experiencing some of the darkest moments in my life, I decided that enough was enough. I had become my own worst enemy.'

Ford said 
he underwent 'intensive therapy' and physical training at Greenstone 
rehab center in Bala, Ontario, where staff forced him to confront his 
'personal demons'.

Echoing earlier sentiments about wanting to run for re-election in November, Ford vowed to serve Toronto for 'many, many years'. 

He had 
entered the Greenestone facility in Ontario on May 1 to be treated for 
alcohol addition after announcing in April that he was seeking 
treatment.

He made the decision after another video surfaced that apparently showed him smoking crack; Ford
 admitted last year after reports of a similar video that he had smoked 
crack in a 'drunken stupor,' following months of denials.
