Mitt Romney got a rave review during this week's church service as his close friend hotel billionaire J.W. Marriott Jr. praised the presidential candidate for bringing positive attention to their shared religion.

'There has never been as much positive attention to the church, thanks to the wonderful campaign of Mitt Romney and his family,' the 80-year-old J.W. Marriott Jr. said at Sunday service at the Church of Jesus Christ of Latter-day Saints in New Hampshire. 

The quick note of praise comes just days after the Republican National Convention, where the candidate and his wife both spoke personally about their Mormon beliefs and also highlighted members of their church who spoke to the nationally televised audience about Mitt's role in the lay organization.

Though only a select few members of the candidate's press pool were allowed into the Church for today's service, CNN reports that Marriott feels that, because of the campaign, the church is 'coming out of obscurity.

He also cited an unattributed statistic that 90 per cent of all media reports relating to Romney's faith have 'been favorable'.

'That's a great tribute to Mitt and Ann and their family for living such an exemplary life,' he said. 'Now that we're out of obscurity, everybody is looking at us and saying, "Are you as good as the Romneys?"'

ABC News reports that Mr and Mrs Romney, who were sitting in the sixth row of the church in Wolfeboro, had little visible reaction to the comments.

The former Massachusetts governor and hotel magnate have been close friends, as were generations of their family.

Mitt's
father, George Romney, was in fact so close to J.W. Jr's father J. 
Willard Marriott that Romney named his son after him. Mitt is the 
politician's middle name, and his legal first name is Willard.

The praise for the Romneys from with their church comes as the candidate's opponents continue to attack his convention speech last week for failing to mention the military.

Republican campaign strategist Eric Fehrnstrom defended Mr Romney, pointing out that the previous day he had 'talked about Afghanistan' in an address to a group of veterans.

'Governor Romney thought it was a privilege to be speaking to people who had served so nobly,' Mr Fehrnstrom told CNN.

As the Democratic convention starts up in Charlotte, North Carolina this week, the GOP will aim to remain in the spotlight by holding daily events on the sidelines, while Republican running mate Paul Ryan will make a speech in nearby Greenville on Monday.

The Marriotts aren't the only ones who 
appear to be happy with the Romney campaign, as the latest Rasmussen 
Report tracking poll alleges that Mr Romney earned 48 per cent of the 
respondents support while President Obama trailed behind with 44 per 
cent. This increase marks a clear change since before last week's 
Republican National Convention when Obama was leading.

Sunday was also memorable for Mr Romney as the day he finally picked up his millionth follower on Twitter, though he still remains some way behind the President, who has over 19million.

Verbally proud: J.W. Marriott Jr., of the hotel magnate family, praised Mitt and Ann Romney during church on Sunday

In addition to his verbal praise, Mr 
Marriott has also pledged a significant amount of financial support to 
his friend's campaign.

Federal
election filings show that he has pledged $1million in personal 
donations to Restore Our Future, a political action committee designed 
to help Romney's campaign. He is far from alone, as The New York Times reported in July, about 20 well-connected Mormons had donated almost $8million to the same PAC.

Though
Mr Marriott kept his remarks about the Romneys brief, he did talk at 
length about an interview he had given nearly two decades ago to show 
how the times have changed regarding the public's understanding of 
Mormonism.

He recalled a CBS interview with
the now-deceased journalist Mike Wallace, and Mr Marriott talked about 
the long undergarments that Mormons wear. Besides just describing the 
custom, which involves wearing 'a t-shirt and pair of boxer shorts', he 
talked about how it nearly saved his life.

'Of
course the one question that they put on the air was, I understand 
Mormons wear different underwear, and I said yes, and he says, "Do 
you?"’ Mr Marriott said.

'I’d
been involved in a very serious boat accident, here in New Hampshire. I
caught fire; my polyester pants had burned off all the way to my waist.
But my undergarments from my waist down to my knees had not even been 
singed. There was not a mark on them. And I said, these holy 
undergarments saved my life.'

Mr Marriott was not the only public figure to praise Mr Romney this weekend - action star Chuck Norris also announced his support of the Republican in a video he filmed alongside his wife Gena.

The message, aimed primarily at evangelical Christians, warned: 'Our great country and freedom are under attack.

'We're at a tipping point and, quite possibly, our country as we know it may be lost forever if we don't change the course in which our country is headed.'

Mr Norris added: 'We can no longer sit quietly or stand on the sidelines and watch our country go the way of socialism or something much worse,' urging conservative voters to head to the polls on Election Day.
