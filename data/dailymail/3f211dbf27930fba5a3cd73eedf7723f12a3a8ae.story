A former Army helicopter pilot has spoken of his excitement at being chosen to spend six months on board the International Space Station.

Major Tim Peake’s mission to the International Space Station will see the 41-year-old blasted into space on a Russian Soyuz rocket from Baikonur in Kazakhstan in November 2015.

Today Prime Minister David Cameron hailed his mission as a 'momentous day for Britain'

Major Tim Peake's mission to the International Space Station will see the 41-year-old blasted into space on a Russian Soyuz rocket from Baikonur in Kazakhstan in November 2015, it was revealed at London's Science Museum today.

Major Peake is the only Briton ever to be accepted into the European Astronaut Corps.

His mission will make him the first UK national to travel and work in space, under the Union Jack, on a British Government-funded mission.

Other British astronauts have either secured private funding – such as Helen Sharman, who flew on a Russian rocket in 1991 – or taken dual citizenship, such as Michael Foale and Piers Sellers, who flew missions on the US space shuttle.

'This is a momentous day, not just for Tim Peake but for Great Britain,' he said.

'It is a great sign of our thriving 
British space sector, which has seen real growth thanks to our 
world-class research, and now supports nearly 30,000 jobs.

'What an achievement that Tim was picked for this historic role from over 8,000 applicants from around the world.

'I am sure he will do us proud and I 
hope that he will inspire the next generation to pursue exciting careers
in science and engineering.'

Major Peake will carry out a science programme and take part in a European education initiative before and during his mission, and is one of six astronauts selected from more than 8,000 hopefuls.

'It really is a true privilege to be assigned to a long duration mission, it feels like a real high point in a long career in aviation,' he told a news conference at the Science Museum in London.

'I am really grateful to my family, friends and professional colleagues who are supporting me as I prepare for the challenge that lies ahead.

'The mission to the International Space Station is going to be a wonderful opportunity, not just for Europe and European science but the UK as well.'

In a jokey reference to David Bowie fan, Commander Chris Hadfield, he said: 'I do play the guitar, but very badly, and I wouldn't inflict my singing on anybody.'

Cdr Hadfield, from Canada, was his country's first professional astronaut, and gained a legion of fans on the Soyuz space capsule mission to and from the ISS, by performing a cover of the Bowie classic, Space Oddity.

Major Peake praised Cdr Hadfield for the 'fantastic job' he had done.

'I don't think I'll be able to top the tweeting, but I will also be tweeting, to encourage a generation to take an interest in space.'He said it was too early to say what experiments he would be involved in, but there were 'rolling experiments' in different fields on the space station which he expected to continue.

These were in fields such as human physiology, medical research into vaccines, fluids physics and astrobiology.

He said it was too early to say whether there would be an opportunity for him to do a spacewalk during his tour.

Peake was one of six people to be chosen to be trained as astronauts in 2009

The UK is now the European Space 
Agency’s third largest contributor and the agency has responded by 
opening its first technical base in the country.

Nick Spall, of the British Interplanetary Society, welcomed the news of Major’s Peake’s appointment.
‘The UK can now take its rightful place and join in with important 
microgravity research work on the ISS, win industrial contracts for 
future human space flight projects and forge new links via ESA with 
Nasa, Russia and hopefully China – and, one day perhaps, India – in 
space,’ he said.

Tim Peake has been selected to go to the International Space Station for five months

‘With exciting potential mission 
opportunities coming up for exploration across the solar system to 
asteroids, the Moon, Mars and beyond for the future, many young people 
will be inspired by Tim and his achievement.

'This will really help boost
the UK’s technical employment potential for jobs and industry. Human 
space flight is a win-win initiative for the UK.’

Major Peake, who has been training 
for the expedition since 2009, beat more than 8,000 hopefuls to be 
selected along with five other colleagues from across Europe.

It was thought that peake would have only a small role due to the UK's modest contributions to the Esa manned space programme

His 14-month training programme 
included visits to Nasa’s astronaut base in Houston, the Russian 
astronaut training centre in Star City outside Moscow, Tsukuba Space 
Centre in Japan, and a two-week survival course in Sardinia. He has also
had to complete mock emergency exercises to see how he copes under 
stress.

Last year it emerged that he was one 
of a team being trained to land on an asteroid to explore the surface, 
search for minerals and even learn how they might be able to destroy it 
should one pose a threat to the Earth.

Major Peake, who served in the 
British Army for 18 years, has been waiting to be assigned a space 
flight since he completed his training in November 2010.

But he recently insisted that the 
long wait did not bother him, telling an interviewer. ‘It doesn’t get 
frustrating at all. There’s just so much going on, so much diversity, 
and there’s brilliant training all along the way.’

The Sandhurst graduate received a 
commission with the Army Air Corps in 1992 and served as a platoon 
commander with the Royal Green Jackets in Northern Ireland.

He gained his wings in 1994 and became a qualified flight instructor in 1998. He retired from the Army in 2009.

Helen Sharman was the first Briton to
go into space in 1991 on Project Juno, a co-operative project between a
number of British companies and the Soviet government. She spent a week
at the Russian Mir space station.

The most experienced British-born 
astronaut is Nasa’s Michael Foale. He has accumulated 374 days in orbit,
completing long-duration missions to both the International Space 
Station and Mir.
