A man who was one of Britain's fattest teenagers lost 17st by working out - but now says the NHS won't remove his excess skin because his muscles mean he's still 'too heavy'.

Jacob Horner, 20, weighed an astonishing 28st when he was 16 and he was so fat his ribs began to ache.

At his peak, Mr Horner was a massive 5st bigger than Nathan Hewitt - who weighed 23st at 15 and was hailed another of the UK's fattest teenagers.

Jacob Horner (pictured when he was 17 and weighed 28st) piled on the pounds on a diet of takeaways and junk food to become one of Britain's fattest teenagers

Mr Horner than started dieting and exercising and lost 17st meaning he weighed a healthy 11st

Determined to turn his life around, Mr Horner began going to the gym and shed an incredible 17st.

He dropped to 11st and then put another 2st on by doing weight training and becoming very muscular.

But Mr Horner claims he has now been denied surgery to remove his excess skin three times because his muscular frame is so heavy he is classified as overweight.

Mr Horner said: ‘Because of my fitness regime I still have a BMI over 25 - the limit for what's considered “healthy” - because of muscle weight.

‘I'm being penalised now because I'm too fit, so I've had to start shedding muscle weight now to get the operation.

‘It's wreaked havoc on my confidence, I should be enjoying my weight loss but instead I feel paranoid about the excess skin I still have.’

As a result of his weight loss, Mr Horner has been left with folds of unsightly excess skin on his stomach

The Doncaster Clinical Commissioning Group (CCG) said it does not have any clinical data about Mr Horner to be able to make a decision on his individual case

However, Mr Horner says the NHS will not pay for him to have surgery to remove his excess skin because he is so muscular that his BMI still classifies him as overweight

Mr Horner, of Doncaster, South Yorkshire, ballooned after a diet of takeaways and five years sitting in his room playing on the Xbox.

But after realising it was time to change, he went on a diet and started going to the gym.

Mr Horner, who lives at home with his mother Sharon and is currently looking for work, has lost so much weight that he now carries folds of excess skin which he is desperate to get removed.

His waist size has shrunk from 58ins to 30ins and he has gone from needing a 4XL T-shirt to a medium, but said the whole situation is making him feel down.

He said: ‘I was overweight from a baby. It got the point where my ribs and bones were beginning to ache and I just thought enough was enough.

‘I tried the Cambridge Diet [a low calorie diet made up of branded shakes, bars, soups and porridge] for a couple of years but it started to make me ill. Since then I've eaten nothing but brown rice, porridge and chicken for two years.

Mr Horner says the excess skin is making him depressed and that it is preventing him enjoying his weight loss

Mr Horner is now trying to lose some of his muscle so that he weighs less and can have the surgery

‘Before that, I was eating typical junk food, lots of crisps and Indian takeaways. My bones were hurting and it ached just to bend down to tie my laces.

‘It took a lot of willpower, but I became driven from day one after seeing results overnight. Also, I just really wanted to prove others wrong and do something beneficial for myself. It's good to have goals.

‘I started going to the gym to lose weight and just loved it. Now I go five times a week and put everything else second.

‘Although, I have had to stop going so much to lose muscle weight to get this operation.’

His mother Sharon said: ‘He has worked so hard at the gym and is so disappointed. He's only 20 so hasn’t had a life yet.

‘He wanted to lose weight for his own health.

‘He’s so depressed because he has worked
 so hard, he hardly dare go out. It’s painful and his clothes pinch. I 
think the whole thing is really unfair.’

Mr Horner added: ‘I've been staying in a lot since losing my weight. The skin has affected my confidence and made it hard for me to get a job.

‘There was even an occasion on a rare night out where a girl saw my excess skin and laughed and ran away. It's really hurtful.’

The Doncaster Clinical Commissioning Group (CCG) said it does not have any clinical data about Mr Horner to be able to make a decision on his individual case.

A spokesman added: ‘We can commission surgery but it will depend on the individual's circumstances.

‘We would advise that he goes to see his GP as there is funding available to pay for surgery following extreme weight loss but there are criteria to meet.

‘He needs to discuss his situation and that would be the best starting point.’

A spokesperson explained that the Clinical Commissioning Group does not usually pay for this type of surgery but that it can be considered in exceptional circumstances.

He said that the extremity of Mr Horner's weight loss means that he could, potentially, qualify but that he would have to maintain a steady weight for two years before he would be considered for surgery.
