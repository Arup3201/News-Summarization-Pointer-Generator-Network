Acquitted: Doctor Terence Burley was found not guilty of all charges after a judge ruled that the evidence against him was 'contradictory, unsatisfactory and unreliable'

A doctor who was cleared of sexually assaulting one of his patients has described his ordeal as a 'living nightmare'.

Dr Terence Burley, 63,  of Peterborough, Cambridgeshire, had faced eight charges after a woman claimed that he abused her during regular consultations at his surgery.

But he was acquitted of all counts after a judge described the evidence against him as 'contradictory, unsatisfactory and unreliable'. 

Judge Gareth Hawkesworth, sitting at Cambridge Crown Court, instructed a jury to deliver not guilty verdicts on the charges - five counts of indecent assault, two specimen charges of sexual assault, and one count of causing a person to engage in a sexual activity without consent.

The complainant, who is now in her sixties and cannot be named for legal reasons, had claimed she was assaulted by Dr Burley while she was a patient of his between January 1996 and February 2009.

Dr Burley told the Peterborough Evening Telegraph: 'It is almost impossible to put into words the enormous sense of relief that this has finally been resolved and I thank everyone who has supported me during this time.

'The justice system travels at a snail’s pace. It’s been a living nightmare for the entire family.

'My lawyer said they had never experienced such an extraordinary outpouring of support and were overwhelmed by the amount of testimonials that came flooding in, from within the city and beyond.'
