Mario Balotelli's immediate future is in Italy, with AC Milan announcing the striker will take part in their pre-season tour of the United States.

The 23-year-old is coming off a disappointing campaign with the Rossoneri and the club's president Silvio Berlusconi revealed earlier this summer that he came close to selling Balotelli to an English club prior to the World Cup.

Back in action: Balotelli will travel with the AC Milan team for their pre-season tour of USA

There has been reported interest from Arsenal and Liverpool in Balotelli, who has three years left on his contract with Milan and is currently on holiday after competing with Italy in the tournament in Brazil.

'Mario will return with willingness on the 21st (of July) and will come with us to the United States,' AC Milan coach Filippo Inzaghi said to Italian TV station Sportmediaset.

Milan will take part in the Guinness International Champions Cup.

The Rossoneri will take on Olympiacos in New York on July 24 before facing Balotelli's former club Manchester City in Pittsburgh three days later.

Milan end the competition against Liverpool on August 2 in Charlotte, North Carolina.

Balotelli scored 14 goals in 30 league appearances for Milan last season but the club finished eighth in Serie A and will not play in Europe in the 2014-15 campaign.

The Italy international started in all of the Azzurri's three group games but scored just once as his country failed to reach the knock-out round in Brazil.
