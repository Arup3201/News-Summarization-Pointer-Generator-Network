Queens Park Rangers midfielder Karl Henry is hoping he can quickly lose the deja-vu feeling his side's current plight of form is giving him.

Henry knows all too well what relegation feels like having lost the battle to stay up when working under Terry Connor at Wolverhampton Wanderers in 2012.

Like current Hoops boss Chris Ramsey, the inexperienced Connor was given the managerial reigns following the exit of a more experienced manager in the form of Mick McCarthy.

But 32-year-old Henry is hoping that's where the similarities end, he told the Mirror: 'This is very similar to when Terry took over at Wolves.

'I just hope the outcome is not the same. It is tough for Chris coming in at this stage, with the transfer window closed and having to rally the troops. But I believe in what he is trying to do.

'As a player you definitely draw on previous experiences and there are other players in the squad who have been in relegation battles, some they have won and some they haven't.

'But no one in our dressing room is crumbling and no one is feeling sorry for themselves.

'You have to look forward. Games are running out so we have to act quickly, we know the next few games are crucial.'
