When schoolgirl Ffion Ward's best friend lost her hair during treatment for a brain tumour she wondered how she could show her pal support.

So in a show of solidarity with Nia Turner, 12, who lost her hair during radiotherapy treatment, brave Ffion, 14, shaved off her shoulder length locks to look like her friend.

And the teenager, from Newtown, mid Wales, took the opportunity to raise more than £1,000 for charity in the process.

Ffion said: 'It's a bit weird to be without my hair. But now we can see what each other looks like bald.

'And I have got plenty of hats as a back-up plan - so I'm not worried at the minute.'

Nia was diagnosed with an inoperable 6cm tumour in the centre of her brain when she was just seven years old.

The tumour has left her with short term memory loss, problems with her sight and unsteadiness on her feet.

Ffion said: 'When I saw Nia losing her hair I thought I would do the same and raise money for charity at the same time.

'It was a bit of a shock to everyone but as soon as I said I was going to do it, everyone supported me.

'Raising the money for charity, doing something for Nia and knowing she could be proud of me - they're the reasons I decided to do it.

'I just feel it is something I need to do while she is alive.

'Growing up with someone and knowing they are going to be taken away from you scared me.

'But it has really taught me that you really need to make the most of your time with everyone.'

Nia's mother Vicki Turner, 41, of Bronllys, Brecon, was full of praise for the fundraising efforts of Ffion.

She said: 'It's absolutely amazing for a child of her age to do something like this.

'She is a lovely young lady and she has been a really good friend to Nia. I think she has been very brave.

'Nia thinks Ffion is nuts.'

Ffion has so far managed to raise more than £1,000 for Hope House children's hospice in mid Wales and Cancer Research UK.  To donate, go to: www.justgiving.com/ffionward3007
