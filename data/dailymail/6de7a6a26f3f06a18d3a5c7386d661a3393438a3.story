A  woman has been found guilty of murdering her baby who she mistakenly believed had dwarfism and did not fit in with her 'obsession with perfection'.

The six-month-old baby girl was discovered by paramedics floating face down in the bathtub of her home in Sydney's inner west, on November 18, 2010.

The Sydney mother, who cannot be identified, was deemed unfit to stand trial and had faced a special hearing earlier in the Supreme Court this month.

But in a marathon judgment handed down today, Justice Geoffrey Bellew found that although the mother was clearly suffering some disturbance of the mind at the time of the girl's death, he said it was not at a level that stopped her functioning.

Instead, he found she had murdered the baby girl by intentionally drowning her.

Describing the 39-year-old as a mother 'obsessed with perfection', the court heard she had raised concerns with doctors soon after the girl's birth about skin tags on her ears.

Noticing some possible limb shortening, the pediatrician tested for achondroplasia, the medical term for dwarfism.

The tests came back negative.

Despite further testing and repeated assurances by doctors over the following months that the girl was healthy and 'normal', the mother became increasingly anxious that she was 'seeing the signs of a dwarf'.

To friends, the mother confided she 'didn't want her perfect husband and perfect life' to be ruined by the baby and that it was likely the girl would need 'head surgery'.

Two days before the murder, she told a friend she wanted to be 'rid' of her baby by jumping off a cliff with her or 'throwing her in a bin'.

Justice Bellew said those statements, in combination with a raft of other circumstantial evidence, had led him to dismiss the mother's claim her baby had fallen out of her bath seat into the water and drowned in a 'tragic accident'.

He also dismissed the alternative partial defences to murder of infanticide and substantial impairment.

The woman, who at times raised her arms in objection and at other points cried throughout the judgment, remained expressionless as her bail was revoked and she was taken into custody for the first time.

The matter was referred to the Mental Health Review Tribunal and will return to court later this month to discuss what the mother's limiting term should be.

A limiting term represents the maximum amount of time she could be detained.
