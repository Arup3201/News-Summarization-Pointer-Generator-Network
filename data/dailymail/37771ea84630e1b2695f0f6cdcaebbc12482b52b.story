New satellite images show the far-reaching destructive power of Wednesday night's fertilizer plant explosion in the small town of West, Texas.

The images show a debris field surrounding the remains of the West Fertilizer Co., as well as what's left of the two tanks that held highly pressurized anhydrous ammonia.

They also show a 50-unit apartment building west of the plant with its walls torn off by the blast, and the demolished West Intermediate School.

The images, fromÂ Digital Globe, give new perspective on the fearsome power of the explosion.

While there are only about 2,700 people 
in the town, the area affected by the blast is a residential location 
with a dense population.

As the dust settled on the small 
community of 2,800 people on Thursday morning, photographs revealed destroyed homes and debris-strewn roads in a four- or five-block radius around  a massive charred crater where the plant once stood.

On Saturday, people were still being kept out of their damaged homes as officials feared for their safety.

At least 179 people were injured in 
the explosion, 13 seriously.

In total, 14 were killed in the explosion that decimated part of the small Texas town, and dozens remain unaccounted for.

When the call came on Wednesday 
evening about a blaze at the fertilizer plant, volunteer firefighter 
Morris Bridges picked up his 2-year-old son, Jaimeson, said 'Daddy loves
you,' and kissed him goodbye.

Bridges,
41, a father of three, has not been seen since. His family have not 
definitively been told that he is dead but they believe he has died.

'As
soon as a call would go out, Morris would be the first one there,' said
his wife, Carmen Bridges, who met Morris in middle school and married 
him about four years ago after reconnecting as they planned their 20th 
high school reunion.

Officials are still investigating the blast. Friday, it was revealed the fertilizer plant failed to report that it had last year been storing 1,350 times the amount of ammonium nitrate that would normally trigger safety oversight by the U.S. Department of Homeland Security.

While the plant informed a state agency in February that it was storing up to 270 tons of ammonium nitrate, the company's risk management plan with the Environmental Protection Agency filed in 2011 made no mention of chemical.

The volatile chemical compound was used in the domestic terror attack on the Oklahoma City federal building.

It's not yet clear whether the ammonium nitrate was responsible for Wednesday's massive explosion, NBC News reported.

State and federal regulators have had to slap the company with several disciplinary actions over the years.

In the summer of 2012, West 
Fertilizer was fined $10,000 for safety violations, one of which was 
planning to transport anhydrous ammonia without adequate security and 
failing to properly label ammonia tanks.

They
ran afoul of regulations twice in 2006, being fined $2,300 by the EPA 
for not having a risk management plan on file while the state Department
of Environmental Quality found the company was operating two 
12,000-gallon tanks for ahydrous ammonia without a permit.

Late on 
Friday, plant owner Donald Adair released a general statement expressing
sorrow over the explosion but saying West Fertilizer would have little 
further comment while it cooperated with investigators to try to 
determine what happened.

'This tragedy will continue to hurt deeply for generations to come,' Adair said in the statement.

Failure to report significant volumes of hazardous chemicals
at a site can lead the DHS to fine or shut down fertilizer operations, a
person familiar with the agency's monitoring regime said.

Though the 
DHS has the authority to carry out spot inspections at facilities, it 
has a small budget for that and only a 'small number' of field auditors,
the person said.

Firms are responsible for self reporting the volumes of
ammonium nitrate and other volatile chemicals they hold to the DHS, 
which then helps measure plant risks and devise security and safety 
plans based on them.
