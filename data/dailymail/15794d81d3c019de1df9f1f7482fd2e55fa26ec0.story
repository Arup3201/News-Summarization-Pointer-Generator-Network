A celebrity finance guru and multi-millionaire was caught by police in a sex act while driving his £300,000 Lamborghini Aventador.

Greg Secker, 39, boss of 'Learn to trade', still had his trousers undone when officers pulled over his black 6.5 litre sports car.

Secker, described on his website as a 'master trader, entrepreneur, philanthropist and international speaker', pleaded guilty to driving without due care and attention in West Hill, Wandsworth, on March 20 last year.

Greg Secker set up 'Learn to Trade' eight years ago. 

Since then it has educated more than 200,000 on how to build their wealth either through earning a second income from trading or learning how to be a full-time trader. 

As boss of the company, Secker was a prized finalist position in the 2010 London Excellence Awards, and claimed 49th place in the 2010 Sunday Times Fast Track 100 Awards. 

There are a number of free workshops offered, but the 'master' programme costs £13,000. 

A charge of drink driving was dropped when the Crown Prosecution Service failed to submit evidence to support their case Secker's urine alcohol level was 148 milligrams - the legal limit is 107. 

Prosecutor Nicholas Earl-Quarcoo told Wimbledon Magistrates' Court police decided to tail and stop Secker at 7.55pm. 

He said: 'The Lamborghini drifted into their lane, which led the officer to take evasive action to avoid a collision with the car.

'They put on their flashing lights and tried to catch up with the Lamborghini, which turned off the A3 and passed through two no entry signs.

'When officers caught up with the car it was parked in a bay with the engine still running and they could see a female in the passenger seat.

'They spoke to Mr Secker and he then pulled up his trousers that were loose and undone and the officer asked: "What happened there?"

'Mr Secker replied: "I know, I'm sorry. I was getting a b******.'"

His lawyer told the court that Secker, a father-of-three from Oxshott, Leatherhead, accepts his behaviour was 'extremely foolish.'

District Judge James Henderson fined Secker £1,000, with £85 costs, ordered him to pay a £100 victim surcharge and endorsed his driving licence with five penalty points.

On his website, Secker is described as having 'always loved speed and as a young boy he was a daredevil rally car driver, a passion that still remains firmly a part of his boyish character.'

He was a multi-millionaire by his twenties having set up one of the UK's fastest growing companies, educating people how on to be a successful trader. 

His success in business has seen him become a high-profile figure and his website shows him rubbing shoulders with Prince William, Peter Andre and Sir Richard Branson.
