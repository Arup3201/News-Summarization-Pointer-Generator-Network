The  jihadi gunman who killed a police woman and four hostages at a kosher deli in Paris was buried near the French capital today after his own country of birth  refused him.

Mali had rejected the body of terrorist Amedy Coulibaly on Wednesday- the day before he was expected to be buried in its soil in Bamako.

Now police sources say the Islamist- who killed a policewoman and four Jewish hostage during the January 7-9 attacks on Paris-  has been buried in the Muslim section of the Thiais cemetery in the Paris region.

Nowhere to go: The body of French jihadi Amedy Coulibaly has been rejected by his birth country, Mali. Coulibaly killed four customers of a kosher supermarket as well as a policewoman 

The 32-year-old small-time dope dealer-cum-terrorist was gunned down by police as they raided the Hyper Cacher kosher supermarket in east Paris on January 9, the day police tracked down Charlie Hebdo massacre gunmen Chérif and Saïd Kouachi.

A day earlier he had shot dead a policewoman in the street and critically injured a street sweeper.

His family had asked for him to be buried in Mali, but that country's government made a sudden U-turn the day before his burial. The West African country gave no reason for rejecting the killer's body which had remained in a fridge in the Forensic Institute in Paris until he was interred in Thiais today.

Government spokesman Stephane Le Foll had confirmed he would be buried in France if his country of birth refused to accept his body. 

The Kouachi brothers, who were Frenchmen of Algerian heritage, were both buried in secret locations in their hometowns - Saïd in Rheims and Chérif in Gennevilliers, a suburb north of Paris - last weekend.

Both were interred at night in unmarked graves, as authorities feared their resting places could become places of pilgrimage for extremists.

The brothers were killed in a shoot-out after hiding in an industrial unit, two days after the attack on the offices of the satirical magazine Charlie Hebdo, in which they killed 12 people.

Neither brothers' hometown wanted the terrorists, but were forced to find graves for them by a French law that grants a right to be buried in the district where the deceased lived or the district where they were killed.

French media reports that no request for a grave has been made in Grigny, the impoverished south Paris suburb where Coulibaly grew up and where his mother and sister still live, nor in Viry-Chatillon, where he was registered to vote.

So it seems most likely Coulibaly will be buried in Fontenay-aux-Roses, the Paris suburb where he had rented a safe house.

A spokesman for the town's mayor said: 'If his family decide to bury him here, I don't think we'll be able to avoid it. The law is strict. But we hope he will be buried somewhere else.'
