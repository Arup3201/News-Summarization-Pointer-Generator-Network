Five boys, some as young as 11, are suspected of starting a fire that wrecked their school on the eve of the new term.

Pupils were yesterday faced with the prospect of coursework having been destroyed in the blaze at Leyland St Mary’s Catholic Technology College in Lancashire.

Plans were being drawn up to provide alternative classrooms for 730 children, with parents warned to keep them at home for at least the rest of the week.

Wreckage: Leyland St Mary's Catholic Technology College in Leyland, Lancashire, was devastated by the blaze at 4pm on Sunday, which saw 100ft flames - and was tackled by 125 firefighters and 20 engines

Flames: The building - which was built in 1957 - had no sprinklers. The cause of the fire is being investigated and is thought to be suspicious, Lancashire Fire and Rescue Service said

Devastation: Several parts of the school had been wrecked, with damage apparently most severe in the science block. Among the contents believed to have been destroyed in the fire was GCSE coursework

Response: About 10 engines from Lancashire Fire and Rescue Service remained at the scene early yesterday to extinguish the last pockets of flames and ensure the scene was safe

Destruction: The aftermath of the fire at St Mary's Catholic Technology College in Leyland, Lancashire

What remains: The fire engulfed most of the college in Lancashire, but left most nearby homes untouched

The 1950s science block was reduced to
 rubble in Sunday’s blaze, which created clouds of smoke visible for 
miles. Sources said the library and sports hall were also wrecked beyond
 repair.

Strong winds and a shortage of water hampered 125 firemen trying to bring it under control.

They
 said the fire tore rapidly through the science block’s 1957 sandwich 
foam board construction before  flames spread to the nearby sports hall.

Police
 said yesterday that five boys – one aged 11, two 12-year-olds, one aged
 13 and one 15 – arrested on suspicion of starting the fire had been 
released on bail until later this month.

Parents said the suspects all attended St Mary’s.

Two men aged 18 and 35 thought to have been
 builders working on the school roof were treated by paramedics for 
smoke inhalation.

Meanwhile 
it was revealed that the Leyland building had no 
sprinklers. The cause of the fire is being probed and is thought 
to be suspicious, Lancashire Fire and Rescue Service said.

About
 10 fire engines remained at the scene early yesterday to extinguish the 
last pockets of flames and ensure the scene was safe.

Firefighters
 were expected to remain at the scene until late this afternoon. Staff 
were due to attend the school yesterday for an inset day, and pupils were to
 return for lessons after the holidays today.

'This is so upsetting to watch. It's heart-breaking. It's very distressing for the staff and for the children'

Kathy McNicholas, Leyland St Mary’s Catholic Technology College head

A
 Lancashire fire service spokesman said: ‘After being called to the 
school on Royal Avenue just after 4pm, firefighters worked in difficult 
conditions to bring the fire under control.

‘The
 school which was built in 1957 had no sprinklers and the roof was 
constructed using sandwich foam boards which helped spread the fire in 
an area that was difficult for the firefighters to reach.

St Mary's headteacher Kathy McNicholas fought back the tears as she watched her school go up in flames last night.

'This is a very big fire and not an easy one to tackle'

Chris Kenny, Lancashire's chief fire officer

‘It's tragic because we have only just had a lot of refurbishment work done to the school during the summer break. It was a big investment. The community around here very much looks after its school.’

Lancashire's chief fire officer Chris Kenny said: ‘This is a very big fire and not an easy one to tackle. We don't know at this stage how it started.

‘We are investigating the cause, but there may be some grounds to think it may be suspicious. A full investigation with the police is underway. There may be some CCTV footage to examine.’
