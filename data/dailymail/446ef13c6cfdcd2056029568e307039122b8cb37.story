A 15-year-old army cadet who was burned with a makeshift flamethrower after selling poppies in the street has been left 'very upset' over the attack, according to his mother.

Schoolboy Callum Watkins suffered burns to his face after he was targeted by a stranger as he waited for a bus in his camouflage uniform after spending the day selling Remembrance Day poppies in Manchester city centre.

The teenager had been selling poppies on behalf of the Royal British Legion on Saturday and was waiting to catch a bus home at 6pm when he was blasted in the face with a lit aerosol jet outside Manchester Art Gallery - less than 100 yards from the city's cenotaph.

The attacker approached him holding an aerosol can and cigarette lighter before spraying the youngster with blazing fumes and walking off without saying a word.

Callum suffered minor burns to his face and singed hairs on his face and right forearm.

His mother Kirsty Sloan said he was 'very upset' by the incident and confirmed he was now recovering at home.

She said: 'His face is burned and he is not very well.

'We just want whoever did this caught so that Callum can put it behind him.'

Callum serves with the Levenshulme Detachment Duke of Lancaster's Cadet Regiment and Colour Sergeant Jackson requested maximum attendance at the drill hall last night to discuss cadet safety after the attack.

Well-wisher Paolo D'angelo posted on the cadet's Facebook page: 'It's beyond being human attacking a soldier in the street (Lee Rigby RIP) but attacking a child! 

'What kind of inhumane person would do such a thing. I hope the cadet makes a fully recovery and it doesn't deter him from selling poppies in the future.'

Royal British Legion bosses condemned the attack and said: 'The  Legion is appalled to hear of this act of violence against one of our poppy collectors in Manchester.

The offender, described as black or Asian, 5ft 8in tall and wearing a dark top, walked off from the bus stop in Manchester city centre without saying a word. Callum has been left 'very upset' over the attack (file picture)

'It is shocking that a young man who has dedicated his spare time as a cadet to supporting the Poppy Appeal could be targeted in this horrifying manner.

'We extend our sympathy and support to the cadet and his family and will be cooperating with the police investigation of this incident.'

The attacker, who appeared to be under the influence of alcohol, was described as black or Asian, 5ft 8in tall and wearing a dark hooded top.

He was last seen walking away from the bus stop by the Manchester Gallery opposite George Street around 6pm.

Detective Inspector Liam Boden, of Greater Manchester Police, said: 'This is an absolutely appalling attack on a young man who was raising money to help remember all those who gave their lives fighting bravely for their country.

'At this stage of our inquiries, we're keeping an open mind as to what motivated the offender to commit such an act.

'Given the initial description we have of the offender, it may be that he was under the influence of something but whatever his motivation, his violent actions could have scarred this young man for life.'

'It is pure luck that he did not sustain more serious burns to his face and body.

'Understandably, both he and his family are in a state of total shock and cannot believe someone would do this.

'We need to find who ever is responsible for this crime and I would therefore appeal to anyone who has information.'

He added: 'This happened at a very busy time in the city centre, near a main bus route, and there could be lots of people who saw this man staggering around.' 

Bill Daw, 89, was forced to sell poppies outside Morrisons supermarket in Taunton in temperatures of 14C

Morrisons later apologised to Mr Daw after the manager of the branch in Taunton, Somerset, suggested that the 89-year-old poppy seller buy a warmer coat because there was not space for him to  sell them inside

Meanwhile, supermarket chain Morrisons faced calls for a boycott last week after claims an 89-year-old war veteran was forced to sell poppies outside its store in the cold.

Customer Veronica Roach said she was shopping in the Taunton branch when she became concerned about the elderly man – later identified as Burma veteran Bill Daw – when temperatures fell to around 14C.

She said his hands were 'freezing' in the cold but when she challenged the manager, he told her there was no room for the Royal British Legion collector inside because of a promotional stand. He suggested Mr Daw should 'wear a warmer coat'.

A store spokesman described the matter as a 'misunderstanding' and claimed Mr Daw had chosen to stand outside.

But Morrisons was eventually forced to apologise after the story was reported in the press, and went viral on social media.

A spokesman said: 'We are very sorry about how this misunderstanding has looked. We will of course donate to the British Legion, and will be making a special gift to both Veronica and our 89-year-old veteran.

'We spoke to the British Legion this morning and the store have removed a number of items in the foyer to enable them to be inside the store.'

Mr Daw is the standard bearer for the Taunton branch of the Burma Star Association. As a 19-year-old private, he helped form a guard when the Japanese surrendered in Rangoon.

He said of the row: 'We've got over it. It is all sorted out.'
