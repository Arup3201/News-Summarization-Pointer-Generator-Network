He dashed out of his holiday apartment
 only to spot an ambulance at the scene of the tragedy. Mrs Flitcroft, a
 betting shop manageress was taken to hospital but died later that 
night.

Today 
an investigation was underway into Mrs Flitcroft's death but is thought 
Spanish authorities are treating it as a tragic accident.

The
 couple, from Blackpool, Lancs, were part way through their holiday at the resort 
of Cala En Porter where they met up with her parents who had retired to 
the island.

Last Friday they
 were in a bar near their apartment watching England play Peru on television
 during the pre-World Cup football friendly.

Mr Flitcroft said:  'Kay was the life and soul of the party. She never wanted to miss anything and always wanted to be the last to leave. I've lost my soulmate'

The couple married at the White Church, in Lytham St Annes, on July 30, 2011 and honeymooned in Portugal. Mrs Flitcroft worked as a branch manager at William Hill bookmakers in Blackpool

After
 the match Mr Flitcroft said he was going to bed, but Mrs Flitcroft said 
she was staying out for a short while and it is thought she went for a 
walk.

In
 a statement Mr Flitcroft said: 'We were having good times - eating, 
drinking and having fun as we always did. We were with friends we had 
met over there in previous years.

'I'd
 had enough so she said the same thing she always said, 'You don't mind 
if I stay out for a bit do you?' 'That was the last time I saw her, she 
didn't come home.

'I
 woke up at seven o'clock in the morning and she wasn't there, so I rang
 round a few people here and no one had seen sight of her since the 
night before.

'I heard an ambulance outside so I ran to where it was, and there she was. My world then ended.'

Mrs
 Flitcroft was taken by ambulance to a hospital on the island, where she
 was accompanied by Mr Flitcroft and her parents Roger, 63, and Sue 
Isherwood, 61.

She was later transferred by air ambulance to Palma de Mallorca, on the neighbouring island of Mallorca.

But
 doctors were unable to save her and Mr Flitcroft received a call at 
8.30am on the Sunday morning to inform them she had died at 11.30pm the 
previous night.

Mr Flitcroft
 added: 'Kay was the life and soul of the party. She never wanted to 
miss anything and always wanted to be the last to leave. I've lost my 
soulmate.'

Mrs Flitcroft - a
 keen hockey player - was born and raised in Blackpool and attended the 
118 year old Arnold School where fees cost £9,060 a year and former 
alumni include a Nobel Prize-winner, the founder of Jaguar Cars and 
ex-footballer Jimmy Armfield.

She studied at Liverpool Hope University before worked as an English teacher in South Korea. She met her husband-to-be through her brother Michael with whom he played football.

The couple married at the White Church, in Lytham St Annes, on July 30, 2011 and honeymooned in Portugal.

Mrs Flitcroft worked as a branch manager at William Hill bookmakers in Blackpool.

Mr Flitcroft who runs his own telecoms and advertising businesses said: 'All the customers loved her and the staff loved her. She loved her friends and she's got hundreds of friends.

'People have been absolutely fantastic and she was one hell of a person. We were brilliant together and we were soulmates. She was such a good person and she was my best friend in the whole world.'

Mrs Flitcroft's parents have been living on the island for the past six months after retiring from running a newsagents. It is thought they may return to live in England.

The family flew back into Liverpool's John Lennon Airport on Monday night.

Spanish police say it could take up to four weeks before Mrs Flitcroft's body is returned, pending investigations.

In a message on Facebook, the family said: 'Kay's husband and family would like to thank everyone for their support & messages during this hard time.

'They would really like everyone's help in raising some money to cover the cost of hospital fees and bringing Kay back home so she can be laid to rest.'

She said: 'It is just devastating and I'm shocked. She was funny, outgoing and loved life.'

A spokesman for the Foreign Office said: 'We are aware of reports and are investigating.'
