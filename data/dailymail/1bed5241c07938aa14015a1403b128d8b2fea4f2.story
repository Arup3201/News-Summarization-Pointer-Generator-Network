A college student has bravely decided to fight back against Internet trolls who took her profile picture and manipulated the image into a cruel meme.

Kelly Martin Broderick was pictured smiling at the camera while holding a sign which read: 'This Is What A Feminist Looks Like' at an event for female leaders at the University of Maryland, Baltimore County earlier this year.

An anonymous troll later stole the image, which had been used as the student's profile picture on a number of social media sites, and added the comment: 'That's pretty much what I expected.'

Cruel taunt: Kelly Martin Broderick's picture while holding the sign 'This Is What A Feminist Looks Like' was turned into a cruel meme

The meme appeared on a Facebook community page called No Hope For The Human Race which describes itself as: 'The MOST HILARIOUS and FASTEST GROWING page on facebook!!'

It also comes with a warning: 'Please don't like our page if you are easily offended or have a hair across your a**! Otherwise, like our page or nobody will ever like you again.'

The image was posted on August 19 and has been commented on hundreds of times, ranging from the vulgar and insulting to more supportive remarks. 

MailOnline was awaiting a comment from the page organizer.

Miss Broderick found out about the meme this week after she was contacted by a stranger on
dating website OkCupid who said he had seen her picture online.

She was sent a link to the meme which revealed it had been shared 2,000 times, had 10,000 likes and 1,000 comments.

Where others may have ignored the upsetting actions of an anonymous troll, Miss Broderick decided to fight the callous act head on.

Taking a stand: Miss Broderick is a student at the University of Maryland

The student wrote on xojane.com: 'Feminists are not a monolith. We are diverse and unique. We don’t fit into every stereotype.'

Miss Broderick added: 'And they picked the wrong feminist fatty to mess with.'

The college student and concerned friends messaged Facebook asking them to remove the picture.

Facebook responded that the meme did not violate community standards nor did it breach her privacy rights.

Facebook had not responded to a request for comment by MailOnline at the time of publication.

As Miss Broderick tried to get to the bottom of the cruel prank, she received a call from her boss who told her the altered image had also been spread across Tumblr.

The college student then decided to take the meme into her own hands.

Miss Broderick started a Tumblr - We Are What Feminists Look Like - to show how the meme had vastly missed the point.

She wrote: 'The biggest miss the creator of my meme made was not realizing the point of the This is What a Feminist Looks Like campaigns; the point is to draw attention to the fact that feminists are not all the same. We are all different.'

Speaking out: After Miss Broderick, (pictured fifth from left with her university friends) was memed by an anonymous troll, she posted it on her Facebook profile to draw attention to the fact they had missed the point of what feminism actually means
