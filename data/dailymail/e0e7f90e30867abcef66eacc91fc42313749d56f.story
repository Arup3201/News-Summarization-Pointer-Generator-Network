Mercy mission: Reconstruction expert Asim Shahmalak is travelling to Pakistan to help acid attack victims

A surgeon is travelling to Pakistan to help women scarred in acid attacks.

Reconstruction expert Asim Shahmalak, from Cheadle, is spending £50,000 of his own money to rebuild the lives of seven women who were disfigured - often for doing nothing more than spurning a man's advances.

He is taking a team from the hair transplant clinic he runs near to Manchester Airport for the mercy mission in January.

Asim, 52, visited his home city of Karachi earlier this year where he met the women who needed hair, eyebrow and eyelash transplants.

Among those he will help are beauty salon worker Kanwal Ashar, 24, who had acid thrown over her by a man who had been stalking her after she turned down his proposal.

Fellow victim Rizwana Mustafa, 23, was also attacked when she spurned a man's advances.

And teenager Sakina Abdul Karim, 19, was horrifically scarred by accident when playing with some other girls.

One of the acid attack victims Asim is helping is beautician Tahira, 24, who was attacked when she was just 13 for spurning a man's advances when she was on her way to work on a bus.

She said: ‘He asked me to marry him. When I said no, he grabbed my hair and threw acid in my face. It was so painful.’

The hero medic is one of only nine surgeons in the world qualified to do the kind of intricate eyelash and eyebrow transplants the women need. The dad-of-two said: ‘It was heart-breaking meeting these women - their lives have been wrecked.

‘They are not accepted by society because of their disfigurement.

‘They
cannot get jobs and, in some cases, they have been disowned by their 
families and they are left to beg on the streets. They are too 
frightened of reprisals to tell the police who has attacked them and 
even if they did, they have no faith that the culprits will be brought 
to justice.’

The doctor saw many acid attack victims on his trip to Pakistan earlier this year, working with the Karachi-based charity Smile Again, but described how many were beyond help.

One such case was a six-year-old child girl doused with acid by her father for refusing to go to school.

She was too young for treatment.

‘I saw two children when I was there,’ he said. ‘But I imagine there are lots more child victims.

‘It is difficult to describe in words what these people have been put through. I could not sleep because I was so upset by what I saw.’

The surgeon will be taking technicians from his Crown Clinic team for the mercy trip and they will be accompanied by a TV crew.

‘I will be spending three days there operating on these women,’ he said. ‘I will be with my team but we will be training local medics so that there is a continuity of care when we are gone.’

Dr Shahmalak was born in Karachi and trained as a doctor there before coming to Britain. He worked as a surgeon in the NHS before setting up his own hair transplant clinic.
