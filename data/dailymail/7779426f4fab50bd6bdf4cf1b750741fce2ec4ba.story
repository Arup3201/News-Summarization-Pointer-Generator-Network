Mary Beard says she was left 'wanting to cry' after she was bombarded with abuse for speaking out in favour of free speech.

The celebrated academic joined other campaigners in calling on universities not to ban speakers perceived to be hostile to transgender people.

But just hours after a letter - signed by Professor Beard and many others including gay rights campaigner Peter Tatchell - was published, she faced a torrent of abuse on Twitter.

Mary Beard and Peter Tatchell suffered a barrage of abuse after signing a letter calling on universities to allow speakers perceived to be 'transphobic' to appear before students in the interests of free speech

The original letter claimed it was 'illiberal and undemocratic' for universities to ban lecturers and academics deemed 'transphobic', meaning prejudiced against transsexual people.

But the letter sparked an angry backlash from some in the transgender community and Professor Beard was later branded an 'unrepentant bigot' and Mr Tatchell was called a 'parasite'.

Professor Beard, 60, later told on her blogÂ how the relentless abuse had caused her difficulty sleeping.

She wrote: 'For two days I have been bombarded by tweets (and a few emails).

'Some tweeters have been very polite in their disagreement; for which, thank you. Others not quite so (I should be clear, though, there have been no threats of violence).

'I got 60 tweets in the space of about an hour from one person alone.'

Mr Tatchell said the attacks were particularly hurtful coming after his history of protesting against prejudice

Professor Beard added: 'Last night I went to bed wanting to weep... It wasn't the force of any remark, it was the relentless pummelling of attack on the basis of extraordinary loaded, sometimes quite wrong, readings of the letter.

'Cumulative harassment is what it felt like, though I am sure it wasn't meant that way.'

Mr Tatchell, 63, said he has received more than 5,000 messages attacking him since the letter was published, some of which, he said, were threatening.

He told the Independent: 'On Saturday night, after the first attacks started, I couldn't sleep. I was so upset about being misrepresented as an anti-trans bigot.

'I woke up exhausted, and on my way to a LGBT conference, I tripped on the pavement, hit my head and suffered concussion, which I'm still feeling today.'
