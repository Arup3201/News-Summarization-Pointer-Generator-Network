Greenpeace has sent its Rainbow Warrior ship to obstruct the removal of the Costa Concordia from the coast of Italy.

Two and a half years after the cruise liner struck rocks and sank off the island of Giglio, killing 32 people, authorities are finally preparing to remove it.

Last summer it was finally wrested off the rocks and refloated in an unprecedented engineering operation.

Later this month the giant cruise ship is to make its final journey – it will be towed to the northern Italian port of Genoa where it will be dismantled and sold for scrap.

Greenpeace Italy claims the five day journey is fraught with danger because of the risk that toxic fluids still in the wreck could leak into the marine environment.

Any storm at sea could be catastrophic as the boat could end up in deep sea where it would be unsalvageable.

Now the Rainbow Warrior is staging a protest at the site of the wreck.

Greenpeace Italy has said there are 'nearer ports that can be reached easily and with less risks'

Luca Lacoboni, of Greenpeace Italy, said: ‘We cannot permit another environmental disaster.

‘To drag the wreck to Genoa would mean five days at open sea. The environmental risks are enormous in terms of leaking of poisonous fluids from the ship and in terms of the structure breaking down.

‘There are nearer ports that can be reached easily and with less risks.’

Genoa beat off many other contenders including ports in Turkey and the UK to win the lucrative contract, which will provide hundreds of jobs over two years.

A spokesman for Costa Cruises said that technical and
engineering assessments have confirmed that the wreck removal plan was safe,
even in severe weather conditions.

'The wreck will be towed at low speed – average of 2
knots - and will be escorted by other vessels, with equipment and specialised
personnel, including a team of marine biology experts and marine mammal
observers, ready to intervene should any problem arise.'

Environmental safety would be the 'priority' of the wreck
removal team, she said.
