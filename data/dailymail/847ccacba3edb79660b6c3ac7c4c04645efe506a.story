Good news: Lower petrol prices for drivers is welcomed by the AA, but towns without an Asda could pay 8p more

Supermarket giant Asda sparked a price war today by slashing its pump prices to their lowest level since February – by knocking up to 2p a litre off petrol.

Sainsbury’s swiftly announced its own price cut and forecourts run by oil giants were set to follow.

But the AA, while welcoming the moves, warned that motorists could be paying up to 8p a litre more in towns where there is not an Asda supermaket forcing prices down.

It also warned motorists that the 
relief may be short-lived because of the volatility of oil and currency 
fluctuations, and the actions of speculators in the market.

Asda
said that drivers filling up at its 192 filling stations would pay a 
maximum of 128.7p a litre for petrol and no more than 136.7p a litre for
diesel after cutting 2p off unleaded and 1p off diesel.

Sainsburys swiftly followed 
Asda’s lead by announcing its own 2p a litre cut on unleaded and 1p per 
litre  on diesel.

But the supermarket refused to say what its average 
prices were by insisting it ‘priced locally’ and would be too difficult 
to work out the average.

However, latest forecourt fuel-price data from Experian Catalist for mid-October show Sainsbury’s average price to be 132.60p for petrol and 137.63p for diesel – against which any subsequent price cuts can be judged by consumers.

Asda said a separate sample survey taken from PetrolPrices.com on November 2 shows that some retailers are getting away with charging up to 8p a litre more in towns where there is no competition from an  Asda supermarket filling station.

An Asda spokesman noted: 'Asda is 
unique amongst supermarkets and oil companies by setting a maximum 
national price cap for its customers wherever they live – others rely on
high prices at filling stations with no local competition to fund 
phoney price drops elsewhere.

‘That
clear policy is what lies behind the AA's confirmation that towns with 
an Asda are likely to have Britain’s lowest petrol prices.’

The AA said prices average petrol 
prices were still within 3p of the all-time record averaging 134.69p a 
litre, with diesel 140.67p. In May, pump prices peaked at 137.43 for 
petrol and 143.04 for diesel.

Asda said its income tracker showed 
transport costs continued to be the main cost pressure on households, 
with UK families £15 a week worse off than they were this time last 
year.

High prices: The AA said average petrol prices were still within 3p of the all-time record averaging 134.69p a litre, with diesel 140.67p. In May, pump prices peaked at 137.43 for petrol and 143.04 for diesel

Jeremy Walton, Asda’s head of petrol 
trading, said: ‘We’re committed to doing everything we can to help lower
the cost of living for our customers, and today’s move shows that Asda 
is once again leading the way in reducing the price at the pump.”

Sainsbury's said it was not part of 
its ‘strategy’ to reveal its average prices to consumers. But it said: 'From tomorrow we will be cutting fuel prices in many of our stores by 
up to 2p per litre.'

A Sainsbury's spokesman added: ’We are doing everything we can to help our customers save money. We regularly check our prices against those of competitors to ensure we always provide customers with great value.’

Paul Watters, head of AA Public Affairs said: ‘We very much welcome Asda’s decision to pass on savings quickly.

'Unfortunately, there are many towns in 
the UK that don’t have their influence and they will have to wait 
significantly longer for wholesale price cuts to be passed on – and 
probably not in their entirety. We hope that other retailers will take 
up the challenge.’

Mr Watters added: ‘A stronger pound and drop in the value of oil have created the chance to give drivers some respite from high fuel prices – but we fear that it is temporary.

'This summer has been characterised by a series of price swings from fluctuating oil prices that reflected more the twists and turns of the euro crises than the fundamentals of supply and demand.’
