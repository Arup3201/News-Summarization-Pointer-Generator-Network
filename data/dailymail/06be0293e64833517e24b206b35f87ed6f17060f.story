Samantha Cameron’s aristocratic relatives have been urged to end a bitter family legal feud that is ‘haemorrhaging money’.

John Sheffield, the Prime Minister’s wife’s second cousin, had sued his 74-year-old father in the High Court over land given to him by his grandfather.

Judge Mark Pelling QC found in favour of Old Etonian Mr Sheffield but urged the warring family ‘whether it might be possible, even at this very late stage, to resolve what remains of this dispute by mediation or negotiation, rather than by further litigation’.

He added: ‘The costs are completely out of control... this case is haemorrhaging money.’

Wrangle: John Sheffield, 50, left, won a case against his family trustees, including his father Julian, 74, right, which entitles him to 25 years of income from a proportion of an estate in Hampshire

Mr Sheffield, 50, was given a 25 per 
cent stake in his family’s 1,000 acre Hampshire estate in 1983 by his 
grandfather, John Vincent Sheffield.

But he says he was deprived of his share of income until his grandfather died in 2008 aged 95.

He sued his father Julian in an attempt to recover money from rent, farm yields and shooting fees covering 25 years.

Last
 month the High Court heard that the grandfather – youngest son of Sir 
Berkeley Sheffield, the sixth baronet of Normanby – had rescued the 
family fortunes after the Sheffields were threatened by crippling death 
duties following the Second World War.

He established the estate at Laverstoke, near Basingstoke, in 1968.

It was his fervent wish that his son Julian and subsequent heirs would maintain the estate.

After
 being advised he could save on Capital Transfer Tax by making lifetime 
gifts to his heirs, he signed documents in 1983 that handed a quarter of
 the income from the land to his grandson, then 19.

The
 younger John Sheffield was then in his second year at university and 
did not read the documents properly before he signed them.

He
 was led to believe that he would not see any real financial benefit 
until his grandfather passed away, said Judge Pelling. It was only in 
2004 that he found out about his income rights.

By this time John Sheffield was bitterly estranged from his father and other members of the family.

The
 earlier hearing was told that he believed his parents were responsible 
for physical abuse he believes he suffered at the hands of one of his 
nannies.

The amount being 
claimed by Mr Sheffield, who like Mrs Cameron is a great-grandchild of 
Sir Berkeley Sheffield, has not been disclosed.

Judge
 Pelling has now found in his favour, saying that there ‘could be no 
real doubt’ the true effect of the gift had been deliberately concealed 
from him and that he had been entitled to 25 per cent of the estate’s 
net income since the day the documents were signed.

The former chairman of bank note paper manufacturers Portals established a 1,000-acre farming estate in Hampshire (pictured)

His grandfather, by retaining all the income, had acted in breach of trust.

The
 evidence that Mr Sheffield had been kept in the dark ‘could not be 
starker’, the judge said. ‘The reality is that the information that was 
withheld from him was information that his grandfather ought to have 
disclosed.’

Julian 
Sheffield and the other estate trustees had argued that there had been 
‘an informal arrangement’ that John would get no income from the estate 
until after the grandfather’s death.

But
 Judge Pelling said in his ruling that, if that were so, the 1983 gift 
to John was ‘a sham in its classical sense’ and would have achieved 
nothing apart from the tax saving that the grandfather was so 
desperately hoping for.
