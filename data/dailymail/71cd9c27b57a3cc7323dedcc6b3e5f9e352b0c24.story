An erotic book based around a garden shed does not sound like an instant bestseller.

But when it is a clever parody of this year’s most talked about racy novel, it is a recipe for success.

Fifty Sheds of Grey, a spoof of Fifty Shades of Grey, has been out-selling the original in recent weeks.

It is one of dozens of satires published following the success of the Fifty Shades trilogy, dubbed ‘mummy porn’.

Parody: Fifty Sheds of Grey has outsold E.L. James' erotic original Fifty Shades of Grey in the last two weeks

Fifty Sheds, which was spawned from a popular Twitter account, has sold 41,000 copies in the last two weeks, while E.L. James’s novel sold 29,000.

Written under the pseudonym Colin 
Trevor Grey, the book tells the story of a middle-aged man who is ‘thrust into
 an illicit world of pleasure and pain’ after his wife reads Fifty 
Shades.

Mr Grey - who describes himself as a 'passionate gardener and amateur shed owner' - has been treating followers to pictures of sexy sheds and Carry On-style erotic puns since June.

Most are horticulture-themed, but many offer hilarious snapshots of his everyday life.

Satire: Fifty Sheds gently mocks the Fifty Shades phenomenon by chronicling the love between a man and his shed

He finds himself caught between his wife’s eagerness to try new things in the bedroom and ‘the love between a man and his shed’.

After accumulating over 90,000 followers thanks to his daily tweets Mr Grey decided to publish
 a book of his funniest entries.

'A very nice chap from Pan Macmillan 
came knocking on my shed door after he saw me on Twitter,' he says. 'He said he 
thought mine was a story the world had to hear and offered me a contract
 there and then.

'Although, I have to admit I was a little wary – the 
last contract I signed was one my wife drew up after reading 'that book'
 and it resulted in me spending every Thursday morning being led round 
Sainsbury’s in handcuffs and a rubber thong,' he said.

When his wife picked up Fifty Shades he said he was unwittingly thrust head-first into the mysterious, illicit world of 
pleasure and pain - and his happy and simple life changed forever.

Looking for a way to express his frustrations, he said he took to Twitter. 'I write my Twitter account alone in my 
shed. It’s the only place I can get a moment’s peace – at least, it was.'

Following the fastest-selling paperback of all time comes Mr Derby's Fifty Sheds of Grey: A Parody: Erotica for the not-too-modern male.

'My
 wife doesn’t know I’ve written a book yet,' he said. 'I’m hoping she doesn’t find 
out, to be honest, as it contains intimate details of past 
indiscretions, including my deflowering at the hands of an older woman –
 I went into her shed a boy and came out a man.'
