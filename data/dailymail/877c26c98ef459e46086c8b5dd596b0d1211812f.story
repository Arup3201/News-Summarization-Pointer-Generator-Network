Kris Bradley, 23, has been jailed for attempted murder of Matthew Probert after he attacked him with a claw hammer

A man who smashed a promising rugby 
player’s skull with a claw hammer so hard that bone splinters embedded 
into his brain, laughed and saluted to his friends as he was jailed for attempted murder today.

Matthew Probert, 21, was left with 
'life-changing' injuries after he was attacked by Kris Bradley, 23, 
after he accidentally bumped into him in a bar.

Bradley was today jailed for 18 years, three of which will be served on licence, at Birmingham Crown Court.

Pictures taken by bystanders show a dazed Mr Probert slumped on the ground with 
the hammer  embedded in his forehead following the brutal attack on August 
31 last year.

Bradley  - who had earlier wept as he was found guilty - saluted his laughing friends from the dock as he received his sentence.

It also emerged that at the time of of the sickening attack, Bradley, of Lincoln, was on bail for two unrelated assault charges.

Judge Melbourne Inman QC told him he would serve at least 15 years in prison before being released on licence.

He said: 'It is clear that you were drinking on the night of the attack and called a friend for help.

'This attack was not fully planned but it was also not a spontaneous attack as it took place around 30 minutes after you were thrown out of the bar.

'You summoned help and armed yourself with a terrifying weapon.

'It is a very serious crime and Mr Probert has somehow made a remarkable recovery.

'You intended to kill Mr Probert and luckily did not succeed.

'The sentence I pass on you is one of 18 years imprisonment for this attempted murder.'

Mr Probert had been celebrating a friend’s 21st birthday with teammates from Scunthorpe Rugby Club when he unintentionally bumped into Bradley on the dance floor of a Walkabout bar in Lincoln city centre.

After leaving the bar, the young prop, who did not know the area, decided to walk away, but Bradley hunted him down.

The court had heard Bradley phoned his friend Daniel Burrell, 23, of Lincoln, who supplied him with the hammer.

Burrell was jailed for four-and-a-half years after being found guilty of assisting an offender.

Judge Inman told Burrell: 'You were at a party that night and not looking for trouble.

'Although you made a very terrible decision to help Mr Bradley and it was very poor judgement on your part.

'Although the hammer was already in your car, you allowed him to take it out.'

A third man, Alex Taylor, 22, who was with Bradley when he attacked Matthew, admitted assisting an offender and was sentenced to 16 months in prison.

The court heard Bradley sent a text to Burrell after the attack which read: 'If anything comes, just say my name, respect, love you mate, I’ll buy you a new hammer.'

Prosecutor Tim Bowden told the court that Bradley would not have 'wanted a one on one fight' with the heavily built Mr Probert.

He said: 'He is a prop forward, it was a night where Mr Bradley and Mr Taylor were drinking heavily and Mr Probert admits to mucking about with his friends.

'There was a slap to Mr Bradley before doormen intervened and they were sent outside.

'Mr Taylor was angry and aggravated and the doormen again separated everyone.

'Mr Probert walked away in the direction of Park Street, that would and should have been the end.

'But Mr Taylor and Mr Bradley were clearly angry and they decided to intercept Mr Probert.

'Mr Bradley called Mr Burrell to deliver him a hammer.

'Mr Probert is a large gentleman, it was clear that Mr Bradley or Mr Taylor wouldn’t have wanted to have a one on one fist fight, Mr Probert would have come out on top.

'Mr Bradley met Mr Burrell and collected the hammer from his car before he concealed it in the waistband of his trousers.

'Mr Probert was separated from his 
friends when Mr Bradley approached him from behind and struck him to the
 left side of his head with the claw side of the hammer, it embedded in 
Mr Probert’s skull.

'That having been done, Mr Bradley and Mr Taylor ran back to Mr Burrell’s car and made their escape.

'They were all then later arrested and interviewed.'

He added that Mr Probert was a promising rugby player who possibly could have made a career out of the sport.

Mark Knowles, defending Bradley, said: 'He still maintains he wouldn’t have wanted to kill anybody.'He has not sought to try and excuse himself in anyway.

'When he woke up the morning after the attack, his text messages showed he had no clue what happened.

'This is a young man with a problem with drink.

'He apologises in open court to the victim and knows his behaviour was simply not acceptable.'

After the attack, he was rushed to Lincoln City Hospital before being transferred to a neurosurgery unit at Royal Hallamshire Hospital, Sheffield, with the hammer still embedded in his skull.

Mr Probert attended the sentencing alongside his family.

In a statement read out after the sentencing his father Mark said: 'We are extremely satisfied as a family with the outcome of the trial against all three defendants and the sentences passed, to what was a truly horrific and unjust act of violence against my son Matthew.

'It goes without question, if it was not for the immediate and prompt assistance and first aid given to Matthew by the door supervisors and emergency services at the scene, the outcome could have been a far lot worse and therefore a sincere and heartfelt thanks must go to all personnel who were involved.

'Matthew continues to make small steps daily to a remarkable recovery and as such he has very much learnt to take every day as it comes. 

'Let’s not forget the seriousness of the injuries he sustained and as such we are all very attentive to the length and time the healing process will take for him to make to a full and healthy recovery.'
