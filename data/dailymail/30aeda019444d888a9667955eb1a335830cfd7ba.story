Rabbi Shmuley Boteach, an Orthodox Jewish author and father-of-nine famed for his uniquely progressive approach, has claimed that in Jewish law, 'a man has to make his wife orgasm before he does.'

Rabbi Boteach, 47 and based in New Jersey, acknowledges that people tend to see Orthodox Jews as 'frigid and inhibited' but told New York Magazine: 'It’s absolutely not true. Among us religious Jews, sex is a big deal.'

He added: 'Oral sex is fine. Anal? Yeah, why not? Sex toys are great. She wants S&M? Sure. What’s wrong with S&M? There’s nothing un-kosher about it.'

The controversial Rabbi who released his latest book, Kosher Lust, in May - pointed out that although our 'single years' are generally supposed to be our wildest, marriage should be about 'swinging from chandeliers.'

In regards to the rule Rabbi Boteach mentioned about women being required to orgasm before their husbands, its origins trace back to centuries ago, and its motive is not primarily concerned with pleasure.

The rule is mentioned in the Gemarra - a compendium of discussions had by Jewish scholars between 200 and 500 A.D. - and was a sex tactic believed to encourage the birth of a boy.

Rabbi Boteach also suggests the missionary position as being the most intimate way for married couples to have sex, although he notes that 'all positions are great.'

According to him, Jewish law, as written in a kabbalistic text called The Zohar, requires full-body contact during sex, and for both men and women to keep their eyes open throughout.

One line from the Book of Genesis - the first book of the Hebrew Bible - has been interpreted as reading that man and woman were initially created as one body to be split into two.

When they were fused, the man and the woman were understood to be facing away from one another. 

Thus when a man and woman face each other during sex and look into each other's eyes, they perfect creation.

Rabbi Boteach also touched on the Orthodox law that forbids couples from having sex for 12 days every month; five days of menstruation and seven days after.

This 'sexual unavailability' apparently drives Orthodox men crazy with 'lust,' which stokes the fires of a passionate marriage.

He also argues that because whatever body parts women cover up in public become 'erogenous' by default, Orthodox women, who wear wigs to cover their natural hair, have more of these 'zones.'

'Hair is one of the sexiest things around,' he remarks. 'My wife has beautiful hair, thank God. She wears a wig, in public. But not around me. It’s ours.'

In Kosher Lust, Rabbi Boteach also advises that couples keep an air of mystery between them to keep their chemistry intact, as too much information can erode at their desire for one another.

For example, he recommends that couples shut the door when they go to the bathroom, as ‘obstacles create greater desire.’

Writer: Rabbi Boteach is the author of over 30 books, including this, his latest

He also advises against walking around naked, especially when the other party is engaged with another object - like the TV.

Being naked too often will cause the other party to lose interest, and makes it less of a special occasion, he suggests.

Rabbi Boteach's use of ancient texts and lesser-mentioned Jewish wisdom to discuss modern sex and marriage has attracted praise as well as criticism.

Talking so openly about sexual matters, for example, is not considered to be 'tznius' - which means modest - and thus contradicts an important Jewish value.

Rabbi Boteach argues that he is doing the Jewish community a service by encouraging healthy intimate monogamous unions, and doing so in a way that modern people can relate to.

The outspoken Rabbi has now authored over 30 books, appeared on The Oprah Winfrey Show on numerous occasions, and during the 1990s, became a close friend and 'unofficial spiritual adviser' to the late Michael Jackson.

He lives with his wife Debbie Boteach and his nine children.
