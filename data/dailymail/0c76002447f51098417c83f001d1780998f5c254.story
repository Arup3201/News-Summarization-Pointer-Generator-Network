Burned: Wesley Daniel, 24, was working on a production at the Lyric Opera of Chicago when the horrific accident happened

A fire-breathing stilt-walker has been severely burned after his head caught fire during a dress rehearsal.

Wesley Daniel, 24, was working on a production at the Lyric Opera of Chicago when the horrific accident happened.

He was rushed to hospital suffering from second degree burns to his face and throat and first degree burns to his hands.

He is understood to be a in a critical condition as he battles respiratory problems.

When he blew the fire, despite wearing a fire-proof fire mask, the flames still took hold.

As he was engulfed in fire Mr Daniel staggered away and collapsed just off stage.

'His head was engulfed in flames and he was centre stage and in a 
panic,' said audience member Edward Voci told ABC Local.

'He was trying to put it out 
and then moved as quickly as he could on stilts but then he had no 
choice but to just fall down.'

A stage manager with a fire extinguisher then put out spots of flame onstage.

The incident happened in front of a 
packed auditorium yesterday and many of the audience thought the stunt was part of
the show, which opens on Friday.

The stunt had been approved by the Chicago Fire Department.

Chicago paramedics took Daniel to Northwestern Memorial Hospital, but he was later transferred to Loyola University Medical Center in a critical condition.

Accident: The rehearsal was five hours in when the accident happened on stage

'I don't
think he closed his mouth quick enough, so the fire, the stuff in his 
mouth, came on his clothes and so did the fire, and it also dribbled all
over the floor so we saw a line of fire across the stage,' said 
audience member Karen Avgush to NBC Chicago.

'And
then I think he was trying to quickly get off the stage, and I think he
was moving too quickly with everybody in the way, so he fell really 
hard off the stilts.'

The horrific accident occurred about 30 minutes prior to the end of the five-and-a-half-hour performance - the show was suspended for about 45 minutes before it resumed.

The audience missed out on the last few minutes of the show because of a union-mandated break for the 81-member orchestra.
