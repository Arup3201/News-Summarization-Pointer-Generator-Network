It is not just the unstoppable march of the Premier League or television continually tinkering with kick-off times that threaten the FA Cup but a coiffured former Wales midfielder with a microphone.

The FA’s fruitless search to find a sponsor for its showpiece competition really was a waste of time: the top brass at Wembley could just have plastered the name Robbie Savage over the famous trophy instead.

He is seemingly everywhere, infiltrating the country’s airwaves, television screens and internet browsers with his peculiar brand of laddish, enthusiastic waffle.

‘For me’, the Savage catchphrase that introduces every hastily-concocted opinion, has become an intrinsic part of football’s vernacular.

We are well past the point of saturation now, worn down by five years of peroxide, fake tan and hyperactivity. Please God, let it end.

On any weekend you can find Savage flitting between BBC Radio 5 Live, BBC television and BT Sport and, if that isn’t enough suffering, you can read his bland comments in his red-top newspaper column or on a betting website or BBC Sport’s website. There is no escape from the wall-to-wall scourge of Savage.

The poor FA Cup has taken a particular hammering this season from Savage, who likes to pit himself as a man of the people, a hard-working underdog who maximised his talent to take on the big boys, just like the best Cup heroes.

1 - ‘You need to take off your rose-scented glasses’ — Responding to a caller on his Saturday radio phone-in.

2 - ‘Football is easy’ — Insight during Aston Villa’s FA Cup win against Leicester on Sunday.

3 - ‘Outside the box, that’s a free-kick but inside the box, I don’t think it’s a penalty’ — Rewrites the rule book while discussing a contentious decision.

4 - ‘Palacios is stupid’ — The second most booked player in the Premier League slams the style of Wilson Palacios at the World Cup.

5 - ‘Mark crossed every i and dotted every t’ — Defends Mark Hughes after he quit Wales to join Blackburn in September, 2004.

Savage’s well-tested formula involves stating something incorrect, over-simplified or blindingly obvious in that harsh, excitable voice and then ramming it home for 90 minutes of painful co-commentary.

And yet Planet Robbie does not stop there. Savage also regularly features on Football Focus, 5 Live’s football phone-in 606 and Match of the Day and took part in an FA Cup special edition of the gameshow Pointless.

Then there is the fawning, matey vehicle of self-promotion that is Matchday Live with Fletch and Sav, BT Sport’s Saturday morning warm-up show, which takes place against a backdrop that looks like a five-year-old has gone bonkers with a set of neon paints after consuming two bags of Haribo.

Nowhere, it seems, is safe from the self-styled ‘Marmite man’ and former Strictly Come Dancing contestant.

He dressed up in a canary yellow suit to promote BT’s coverage of transfer deadline day and freely laughed at the mockery that followed the BBC’s decision to put ‘Robbie Savage: Worthington Cup Winner’ alongside the decorated Clarence Seedorf and Thierry Henry at last year’s World Cup.

The Welshman competed alongside dancer Ola Jordan in the 2011 season of Strictly Come Dancing 

‘I was most relieved Clarence and Thierry knew who I was,’ Savage later posted on Twitter.

But if we hoped the fan on the sofa had gone with the demise of Adrian Chiles, we are to be disappointed.

Paul Scholes mouthed an expletive on live television in response to one Savage soliloquy, while Gary Lineker was distinctly unimpressed by the Welshman’s animated defence of West Brom’s Claudio Yacob’s challenge on Chelsea striker Diego Costa in November. ‘Robbie, it was a red card,’ said Lineker, wearily.

The former England striker was also quick to mock Savage’s assertion that ‘football’s easy’ during his hopeless stint in the commentary box for the Aston Villa v Leicester Cup tie last weekend. ‘I saw you play, mate. Is it really?’ added Lineker.

Savage, though, sees this as ‘banter’. He appears to revel in it, just as he happily rebuts the deluge of Twitter abuse that comes his way after every television, radio, online or newspaper appearance. But then Savage would prefer people to talk about him in any way rather than not at all, even if his desire for popularity sometimes verges on the desperate. ‘I’ve always wanted to be liked,’ he said in a recent interview with The Daily Telegraph.

The thing about Marmite, though, is that somebody must like it. Savage, now 40, has 1.4million Twitter followers yet it is a struggle to find vocal supporters outside the band of radio and TV executives who adore him for his undoubted work ethic and willingness to make a complete prat of himself.

The gigs, after all, just keep on coming. Savage won the Sony DAB Rising Star Award in 2011, receiving more votes in the public poll than any previous recipient of the prize.

Remarkably, it is also understood Savage scores favourably in focus groups. Sky, ITV and talkSPORT must have spent a fortune planting punters in these audience feedback sessions or else the participants are all wearing their hero’s brand of ‘rose-scented glasses’, as he once famously remarked.

There must, after all, surely be something better than this. Why are we subjected to Savage every time we turn on the radio or television? There should of course be room for football pundits who do not take themselves too seriously, but their primary purpose is to inform and explain and Savage rarely does either.

Those close to him say he is a decent, well-meaning bloke who does a lot of charity work and works incredibly hard, but that does not mean we want to listen to him rattle on for 90 minutes or that we care what he has to say at half-time, either.

Volume of opinion does not compensate for lack of substance.
