Capsules: Calamari Gold is made from squid caught for sale in shops and restaurants

Hated by generations of children, it took being put into a capsule to make cod liver oil palatable, but even that might not be enough to save it.

It is facing a challenge from squid oil, which is said to be much higher in health-boosting properties.

Calamari Gold is made from squid caught for sale in shops and restaurants, and contains high levels of omega-3.

It is particularly rich in a form of the essential fatty acid called DHA, which is good for our brain, eyes and heart.

Capsule for capsule, the product is claimed to contain up to four times as much DHA as cod liver oil.

‘DHA is the predominant omega-3 in many of our vital organs and is fundamental for our health,’ said nutritionist Suzie Sawyer.

‘DHA is important for brain health, improving concentration, memory and cognitive development.

‘It is critical in the maintenance of overall eye health and research indicates it can help to improve blood pressure and may reduce the risk of heart disease.’

Unlike cod, squid is not overfished, and its relatively short lifespan means it accumulates fewer toxins than some other fish.

The NHS recommends that we eat fish twice
 a week, but many of us would rather pop a pill – the latest figures 
show that Britons spend almost £10million a year on omega-3 supplements.

Miss Sawyer said: ‘With rising costs 
of seafood, the supplement is the more economical option to eating the 
recommended two portions of food a week and a great alternative for 
those who dislike seafood.’ 

A
 month’s supply of 30, 1,000mg Calamari Gold capsules costs £34.99 from 
Holland and Barrett. An equivalent supply of cod liver oil capsules 
costs around £2.25.
