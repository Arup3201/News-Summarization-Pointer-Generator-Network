Celtic have been fined just under £10,000 by Uefa following the misbehaviour of both their players and fans during last month's Europa League clash with Inter Milan.

The Hoops have been ordered to pay £5,861 after collecting five or more cautions during the 1-0 defeat to the Italians at San Siro.

Virgil van Dijk was sent off for two bookable offences, while five other players were booked in the 1-0 loss.

They were also hit with a further £3,663 punishment after travelling supporters set off flares during the Round of 32 fixture, which saw the Scottish champions crash out after a 4-3 aggregate defeat.

UEFA had already fined the Scottish champions earlier this year for supporter behaviour during their tie with Dinamo Zagreb.

This is the seventh time the Parkhead club have been punished for the actions of their fans since December 2011.

Roberto Mancini's Inter were also fined £3,600 for their supporters letting off fireworks.
