Supermarkets were yesterday accused of targeting parents by selling alcohol alongside school uniforms and sweets.

Campaigners said the irresponsible tactic could encourage impulse buying and ‘normalise the role of alcohol’ at home.

A Home Office investigation found bottles of Smirnoff vodka, Jagermeister and other spirits on sale in Tesco next to school clothes.

A Sainsbury’s store was found selling chocolate snowmen and other sweets next to bottles of Absolut vodka and Bacardi rum.

Other promotions uncovered included a WHSmith store at a motorway service station selling Strongbow cider and Carlsberg lager alongside soft drinks and food.

A Lidl store stocked boxes of Christmas Jaffa Cakes next to bottles of spirits, cider and sparkling wine.

Norman Baker, the Liberal Democrat crime prevention minister at the Home Office, said: ‘The situation where some irresponsible supermarkets sell alcohol next to children’s clothes or sweets can only encourage impulse buying. This is unacceptable and needs to stop.’ 

He added: ‘Industry needs to raise its game and do much more to help reduce problem drinking, and supermarkets have to recognise they have a significant part to play in this.

‘They need to promote and display alcohol more responsibly, do their bit to improve public awareness of the dangers of drink and support local areas in tackling alcohol-fuelled crime and disorder.’

Tom Smith, of Alcohol Concern, said: ‘Retailers have got to start taking this seriously and stop selling alcohol alongside everyday products such as children’s sweets and school uniforms.

Selling booze like this drives impulse buying and serves only to normalise the role of alcohol in society.

‘The reality is that we’re facing historically high levels of health problems caused by alcohol misuse. If we’re to develop a culture of more responsible drinking, retailers have to play their part.’ 

Supermarkets have resisted government pressure to put alcohol in aisles separate from other items.

Home Office figures show 963 big supermarkets sell alcohol round the clock.

They make up 13 per cent of all bars, shops, hotels and pubs licensed to open 24 hours.

Last year David Cameron abandoned plans for a 45p minimum price for a unit of alcohol amid resistance from the drinks industry, and a proposed ban on multi-buy discounts was also ditched.

But Mr Baker’s comments signal a tougher line on alcohol promotions from within government.

Tesco said: ‘Alcohol should not be next to school uniforms or any other products for children in our stores. We are looking into what happened in this store.’

Lidl said: ‘We take our role as a responsible retailer, and all matters of sales of age-restricted products, extremely seriously and will take any comments about the merchandising of our products on board.’ 

Sainsbury’s said: ‘We take the sale of age-restricted products very seriously. Anyone working on a checkout is trained to ask customers who look under 25 for ID before selling them alcohol.’

WHSmith said: ‘We have a very limited range of alcoholic drinks available in a small number of stores. We are committed to responsible marketing of these products; however, in some cases, the small store size makes it difficult to position alcohol far from soft drinks.

‘We comply with all legal requirements and ensure we are in line with best practice.’
