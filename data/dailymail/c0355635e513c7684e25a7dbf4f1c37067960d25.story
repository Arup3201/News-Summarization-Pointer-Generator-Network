It’s the kind of gadget to have Patsy and Edina purring with approval… Champagne at the press of a button.

But this vending machine is not a prop from Absolutely Fabulous. It has been installed in the luxury department store Selfridges.

Well-heeled customers can enjoy chilled 200ml bottles of Moët & Chandon at £18 a pop. The vending machine holds 350 bottles, each of which is coated in mini Swarovski crystals  – without any of the more usual fizzy drinks in sight.

The Moet and Chandon dispenser is the first champagne vending machine in the world

It holds 350 200ml bottles of the fizzy tipple - and each one is coated in mini Swarovski crystals.

The golden Moet and Chandon vending machine has taken pride of place at famous London department store Selfridge’s.

The vending machine is so flash that it doesn’t accept coins.

Instead shoppers have to pre-pay for the champagne at a special counter in the heart of the Oxford Street store’s ‘Christmas Emporium’.

And, unlike normal vending machines where items are dropped from a height, clattering down into a tray below, the Moet dispenser delivers its spoils with a golden robotic arm.

But buyers will have to bring their own glasses if they want to enjoy their posh purchase on the go.

Dawn Davies, wine and spirits buyer at Selfridges, said: 'Working with Moet & Chandon to unveil the world’s first champagne vending machine has been an exciting collaboration for Selfridges.

'The timing couldn’t be more perfect - they make a lovely little stocking filler.

'The installation forms part of our bespoke, personlised gifting taking place throughout the store.

'This year, Selfridges have taken Christmas to a whole new level, transforming the entire fourth floor into a one-stop destination for gifting.

'The inclusion of the world’s first Moet vending machine makes a decadent addition to our Christmas Emporium.'

The Moet and Chandon dispenser is the first champagne vending machine in the world, and the latest in a line of luxury vending machines to be unveiled.

Westfield Shopping Centre in London has a machine that dispenses gold bars while its LA malls are stocked with dispensers selling caviar, truffles and snails.

A vending machine at the Mondrian South Beach hotel in Miami sells luxury items such as Bentley cars, Jean Paul Gaultier dresses and 24 carat gold handcuffs.

They may seem unlikely wine-makers but a rosé created by Brad Pitt and Angelina Jolie has been judged the world’s best.

The Hollywood pair’s first vintage, made at their 1,000-acre estate in the South of France, came 84th in Wine Spectator magazine’s Top 100. It is the first rosé to ever make the list.

The £18 bottle was described as ‘refined and elegant’ and given an ‘outstanding’ 90 out of 100.

French experts helped produce the wine, but Jolie, 38, and 49-year-old Pitt - nicknamed Brangelina - had a role in the blending process at their £20million Château Miraval estate in Provence.

Bottles of the 2012 Jolie-Pitt & Perrin Côtes de Provence Rosé Miraval sold out within hours when it was released in March.
