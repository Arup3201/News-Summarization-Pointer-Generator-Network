Killed: Antonio Martin was shot dead by an officer on Tuesday - but the cop was not wearing a body cam

A police officer who shot dead a black teenager at a Missouri gas station on Tuesday night was not wearing his body camera at the time - even though he had been issued one of the department's three cameras earlier that evening.

The officer, a six-year veteran of the Berkeley Police Department, is on administrative leave for killing 18-year-old Antonio Martin after the teen pointed a weapon at him, police said.

The officer, 34, had been assigned a camera at roll call at the start of his shift but didn't put it on, St Louis County Police Chief Jon Belmar said at an early-morning press conference on Wednesday.

The police chief suggested that the officer, who has not been named, had been handed the body camera when he was distracted by something else, such as a call.

'He said he clipped it somewhere in the car, didn't put it on, and next thing you know you're here,' Belmar said.

Berkeley Mayor Theodore Hoskins said that the police department has just three body cameras. There are 31 officers in the department in Berkeley, a town of around 9,000 residents on the outskirts of St Louis.

Belmar and Hoskins downplayed the officer's oversight, saying it is unsurprising that he forgot to attach the camera because they have only just started using the devices.

Hoskins, speaking at a separate news conference on Wednesday, said he was 'not concerned'. 

'At this point it's relatively new,' he said of the technology. 'We only have three, so if it had been six months from today and we had gone through all the training I would have some concerns.'

On camera: The teenager can be seen raising his arm on this surveillance footage, which was taken from the gas station's cameras. Police said it shows him raising a gun and pointing it at the police officer

He said that thankfully they had surveillance footage from the gas station to help them figure out what had happened. 

'It would've been helpful' to have the body cam footage, he said, 'and in the future and when we get well trained, there will be a severe penalty for an officer who does not turn it on.'

The officer also did not have his dashboard camera on inside his patrol vehicle, but Belmar said the camera is activated when the car's red flashing lights are on, which they were not.

Instead, the late-night incident was captured by surveillance cameras outside the Mobil gas station in Berkeley, and police shared the footage at the news conference on Wednesday.

The officer, who was responding to a call about a theft in the area, drove up to the gas station and called over two men, including Antonio Martin.

As the officer was speaking to the other male, Martin pulled out a weapon and pointed it at the officer, police said. 'Fearing for his life', the officer pulled out his weapon, stumbled backwards and fired three times, hitting Martin once, police said. He was pronounced dead at the scene.

No concerns: At a press conference on Wednesday, St Louis County Police Chief Jon Belmar explained that the officer did not put on his assigned body camera and clipped it inside his car instead

Berkeley Mayor Theodore Hoskins said he was not concerned that the officer was not wearing the camera. He added that after officers receive more training, there will be harsher penalties for forgetting them

Also at the scene, investigators found a loaded 9mm gun with its serial number filed off, which they say belonged to the slain teenager.

The second man fled the scene and police are still looking for him.

After the death, as many as 300 people descended on the gas station, with some starting explosions or throwing bricks at police officers. Patrol cars were damaged and two officers went to hospital with minor injuries, Belmar said. Four arrests for assaulting police officers were also made.

The officer's attorney, Brian Milliken, would not comment on why the cop was not wearing his body camera at the time of the shooting, telling the St Louis Post-Dispatch: 'There could be some internal issues.' 

Body cameras have been a subject of debate in recent months following the shooting of Michael Brown in Ferguson in August.

Both police officers and protesters have argued that if all police wore body cameras, it would help prove innocence or guilt, and could alter the way people act and ultimately save lives.

At the end of August, police officers in Ferguson began wearing cameras attached to their uniforms.

About 50 cameras were donated by two private companies, Safety Visions and Digital Ally, after the shooting of Brown, Ferguson Police Chief Tom Jackson told the Post-Dispatch at the time.

The newspaper reported that other police departments in the St. Louis area were planning to start using wearable cameras, the Post-Dispatch says.

At the start of the month, Obama appealed to Congress for $263 million to help buy 50,000 body-worn cameras that could help provide information about incidents involving police interactions.
