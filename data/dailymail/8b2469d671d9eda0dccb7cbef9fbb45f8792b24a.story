As sports go, basketball is one of the less perilous – but Harlem Globetrotter William 'Bull' Bullard demonstrated recently that it has its risks.

He narrowly escaped with his life when he dramatically slam-dunked a ball during an exhibition game at the Nacional de Ingenieros Coliseum in Tegucigalpa, Honduras, during a tour of Central America, only for the hoop to fall on top of him.

Bullard had clung athletically to the structure with his hands and feet, but it gave way.

Spectators watched in horror as the 29-year-old landed on his back and was struck on the head by the rim of backboard.

For a few moments, Bullard lay motionless on the court, next to a mound of shattered glass, clearly hurt and dazed.

TV cameras zoomed in, revealing that he had a nasty gash on his head.

Eventually, and to the delight of the crowed, the 6ft 4 No33 from Detroit got to his feet and walked off to receive treatment.

The Harlem Globetrotters are an exhibition team founded in Chicago in 1926.

Their skills are legendary and they don’t often lose games. In February 2006 they notched up their 22,000 win.

They’ve lost 345 games to date, which gives them a losing percentage of just 1.5. The last defeat came in March 2006.

The Globetrotters' world tour brings them to England and Scotland in 2014.

Venue: The accident happened at the Nacional de Ingenieros Coliseum in Tegucigalpa, Honduras
