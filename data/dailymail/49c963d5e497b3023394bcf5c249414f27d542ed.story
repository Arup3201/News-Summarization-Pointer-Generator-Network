Real Madrid have been handed a tough draw in their Copa del Rey defence with potential ties against Atletico Madrid and Barcelona on the way to the semi-finals.

The Champions League winners face Cornella in the fourth round while Spanish champions Atletico take on Hospitalet.

And the two Madrid giants would clash in the last 16 if they both win their fourth-round ties, which will be played over two legs.

Real and Atletico both travel to Barcelona for their first legs with  Cornella and Hospitalet each based in the Catalan city.

Cornella, who are in the third tier of Spanish football, play their home games at a stadium called the Nou Camp.

Barcelona, who were beaten in the final by Real Madrid last year, will open their campaign against Huesca.

If Real do face Barcelona in the quarter-final, Los Blancos' supporters will be hoping that Gareth Bale can repeat his heroics from last season.

The Welsh winger memorably won the game for Madrid in the dying stages with a trademark solo goal. 

Barcelona are currently top of La Liga after an unbeaten start to the season, while Real are in fourth position and Ateltico are in fifth. 

Barca and Real will also do battle on October 25 in the eagerly anticipated Classico at the Bernabeu - a game which is expected to mark the return of controversial striker Luis Suarez from his five-month suspension.
