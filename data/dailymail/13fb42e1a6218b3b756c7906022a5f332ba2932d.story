Britons wake up grumpier than anyone else in the Western world, according to users of a sleep app.

Even though we get more time in bed than most other nations – seven hours 22 minutes a night – only the Japanese, South Koreans and Singaporeans are moodier when day breaks.

People in these three countries have an excuse – they spend less time in bed, with the Japanese getting an hour and a half less sleep.

Moody mornings: Brits wake up grumpier than anyone else in the Western world, according to users of a sleep app... despite getting more time in bed than most other nations – seven hours 22 minutes a night

But while we might sleep longer, we don’t feel as refreshed in the morning, according to results from users of the Sleep Cycle app. 

The app tracks how well people rest at night by using the motion sensor in their smartphone.

The app then comes up with a ‘sleep score’ for the user.

By looking at results from 944,000 people, including 75,000 from the UK, researchers found the British had the seventh most disturbed sleep out of 50 countries surveyed. 

And our mood on waking – determined by users tapping a ‘happy’, ‘sad’ or ‘in-between’ face – was fourth worst, even though we spend more time in bed than anyone bar the Finns (7hrs 23mins), Dutch (7hrs 24mins) and New Zealanders (7hrs 27mins).

But sleep expert Dr Neil Stanley questioned the accuracy of such apps because they assume you are asleep if you are still, which is not always the case.
