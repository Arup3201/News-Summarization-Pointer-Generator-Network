A mother-of-two woke from being sedated to discover all her top teeth had been removed, despite her visiting the dentist to have a new crown fitted.

Nicki Stanley was plagued by poor dental health for years, and expected to have new crowns fitted when she visited the dentist.

While the 46-year-old was deeply sedated, all her upper teeth were removed.

She was left needing to wear ill-fitting dentures or face going toothless, and became reluctant to leave her home.

But Ms Stanley can now smile with confidence once more after a pioneering cosmetic dentist stepped in, fitting tooth implants.

'When I lost all my teeth, it was like losing my personality,' she said. 

'I couldn't even bring myself to go out in public - with my new smile, I'm a completely different person.'

Nicki Stanley, 46, from south London woke after being sedated in the dentist's chair to discover all her top teeth had been removed unexpectedly

Ms Stanley said she had only visited the dentist to have new crowns fitted and didn't expect to leave toothless. For five years she became a recluse, too embarrassed to leave her home

Ms Stanley believes her dental problems stem from her mother's use of antibiotics while she was pregnant.

Despite always looking after her teeth, she found herself needing fillings and other work.

Terrified of being in the dentist's chair, she was deeply sedated ahead of the dentist performing what Ms Stanley believed would be crown work.

But instead the mother-of-two woke to find every tooth from her upper gum was missing.

For six years her ill-fitting dentures plagued Ms Stanley, causing her to become a recluse, only leaving the house to go to work as a teaching assistant. 

Scarred by her experience, she refused to step foot inside a dentist surgery, and as a result failed to seek treatment for her decaying bottom teeth.

The majority fell out and she ended up with just five teeth on her bottom gum.

Now, thanks to Harley Street dental surgeon brothers Dr Anthony Zybutz and Dr Michael Zybutz from Total Dental Care, Ms Stanley has her smile back.

The brothers were forced to remove all her remaining teeth, and the rotten stumps from her upper gum during an eight-hour operation worth £30,000. 

'I had tried everything to keep my teeth in good shape. I had special fluoride toothpaste, I visited the dentist as often as I could - but nothing worked,' Ms Stanley said.

'I only had six teeth left on the top but it was enough to keep crowns and not need dentures - that was my worst nightmare.

'When I left the surgery I was still a bit confused from the sedation - when you're in that state you haven't got a clue what is going on.

'It was only when I got home and came round after three or four hours of sleep that I realised what had happened.

'The horror when I started feeling my mouth and found nothing was unimaginable.

But Ms Stanley now has her smile back after Harley Street dentists spent eight hours fitting implants

'Although I went back a few weeks later to have a dental plate fitted they were uncomfortable and almost impossible to do anything with.

'She did her best but nothing could make them stick in my mouth.

'For five years I barely left the house and I was never photographed - I'd never been so embarrassed.

'And I was so scared of going back to the dentist that I haven't been able to get my bottom teeth sorted either.

'I had no quality of life and I constantly cancelled plans so that I didn't have to interact with other people and expose my fangs.

'I rarely spoke if I didn't have my hand covering my mouth.

'The difference having tooth implants - I've never been happier.

'I'm out every weekend celebrating my new smile.

'I've never been able to go around my head so high until now.'

Dr Anthony Zybutz performs more than 80 dental implant procedures a year.

He said: 'Nicki had all of her remaining teeth removed - and she didn't have that many left - and a full set of dental implants.

'For someone so young to have all her teeth removed is quite rare - it's really much more common for people in their 70s or 80s who would have had all their teeth removed preventatively.

'This is not a simple procedure and but we're a specialist clinic.

'It's absolutely brilliant to see the difference it has made to Nicki.

'Her new confidence is incredible and I'm so pleased to see how life-changing it has been for her.'
