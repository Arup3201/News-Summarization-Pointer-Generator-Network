Medals awarded to the Royal Navy officer who 'turned the tide' during the Falklands War are expected to reach up to £50,000 at auction today.

Captain Brian Young DSO commanded British forces during a key mission to recapture South Georgia from Argentina.

Operation Paraquet ended the three-week occupation of the island by Argentine marines.

Collection: Memorabilia to be auctioned at Bosleys Specialist Military and Medal Auctioneers include his Distinguished Service Order medal and South Atlantic Falklands medal

His Distinguished Service Order medal, Naval General Service medal, Campaign Service medal and a South Atlantic Falklands medal are among the items being auctioned.

Captain Young led the Battle for South Georgia on April 25, 1982.

An Argentine submarine, the Santa Fe, posed a major threat to the British forces. But under Captain Young's lead it was attacked and disabled in the first ever anti-submarine operation successfully conducted exclusively by helicopters.

The last of the enemy garrison quickly surrendered the following day and the island was restored to British administration with only one casualty, on the Argentine side.

According to the London Gazette, 
Captain Young 'displayed the highest standard of leadership' with use of
'bold initiative' and a 'cool appraisal of the situation'.

'He
deployed the sea, land and air units under his command to maximum 
advantage, often in the face of appalling weather conditions and bad 
visibility,' it said.

'The 
importance of this operation to the overall strategy of re-establishing 
British administration in the Falkland Islands and its dependencies 
cannot be overstated nor can Captain Young's personal contribution to 
its success.'

Other items 
included in the auction at Bosleys Specialist Military and Medal 
Auctioneers in Marlow, Buckinghamshire, include his pilots flying log, a
large selection of photographs and military badges and insignia.

Together they have an estimate of between £30,000-50,000.

Captain Brian Young was born on September 25, 1930, to farmer parents in Kent.

At just 14, he joined the Royal Navy as a cadet where he served in the battleship King George V.

It was during a stay in the United States between 1954 and 1958 that he learned to fly with the 803 and 804 naval squadrons.

Afterwards he served in the RAF as an instructor before joining the 892 squadron in Centaur during the Confrontation in Borneo - the undeclared war between Indonesia and Malaysia that run from 1962 to 1966.

Captain Young then became senior pilot of 804 squadron in the carrier Hermes. 

He was appointed commander of Operation Paraquet, when British forces recaptured South Georgia.

He
flew operations over Malaya and Borneo before being posted to command 
the Navy's 766 'top gun' squadron at the All Weather Fighter School.

During the Falklands conflict Young was also captain of the large guided missile destroyer Antrim. 

The day after the Argentine garrison at Leith on the island of South Georgia, Captain Young signalled London with the message: 'May it please Her Majesty that the White Ensign flies alongside the Union Flag on South Georgia. God Save the Queen.'

He died on Christmas Eve 2010, aged 79.
