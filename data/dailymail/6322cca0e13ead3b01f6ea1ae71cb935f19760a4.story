The father of Real Madrid youngster Jack Harper has revealed that Spain have been in contact over his son's international status following the 19-year-old's Scotland snub.

Harper was a shock omission from Ricky Sbragia's Scotland Under 19 squad ahead of key clashes against Austria, Italy and Croatia with the former Sunderland manager citing 'purely tactical' reasons.

Now, Harper's father John has warned Scotland that they could be in danger of losing his son to the Spanish national side.

He told the Daily Record: 'The day after Scotland announced the Under 19 squad, and Jack wasn’t included, Spain were on the phone asking about his position and international status.

'Their national academy is just a few miles from Real Madrid’s own training ground, so they know about Jack because they watch his team often enough.'

Despite being left out of Sbragia's latest UEFA Under 19 Championship squad, Harper's father insists that the Madrid starlet remains committed to Scotland.

John added: 'Jack wants to play for Scotland. I’m Scottish, so is his mum and the rest of the family. He is committed to Scotland, but if nothing is happening by the time he is 21 then he will have a decision to make because he has a life and a career to fulfil. Hopefully, it won’t come to that.'

Sbragia also still believes Harper, who was born in Spain, has a big future ahead of him in a Scotland shirt. 

He said: 'He's an exceptionally gifted lad, but sometimes we can't carry him. He can be a luxury sometimes. In some cases, if it's going well, he can be a good luxury.'

'Listen, Jack's time will come. The last time I spoke to him, he wanted to really settle in at Real Madrid and find a place there. That's been a big thing for him.

'I've gone with the boys I've seen most in the last six months. We keep tabs on Jack and see video clips of him. We have people over there who keep their eye on him.

'There are others I've left out like Dominic Thomas at Motherwell who will have gripes that they're not in the squad.

'But I've picked a group of 18 which will hopefully do well for us. It's my opinion and I'm not saying it's right. But the squad I've picked is an extremely strong one.

'I can only pick 18 when I really could have picked 26 or 27. I've gone for a physical side and runners. Hopefully I'm right.

'It's purely tactical and there certainly hasn't been a lack of enthusiasm from Jack about playing for Scotland.'

Harper is currently midway through a five-year deal with Real Madrid and is tipped to have a big future
