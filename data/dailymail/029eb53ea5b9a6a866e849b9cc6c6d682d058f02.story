A man in his 40s has died after an accidental fire on a canal boat which is believed to have been started by a wood-burning stove.

The victim, who has not yet been identified, was found by a dog walker on the Kennet and Avon Canal near Trowbridge, Wiltshire, early this morning.

It is thought the boat had been 'well alight' for some time and the windows were said to be too hot to touch when rescuers arrived, just after 7.20am.

Firefighters were called to tackle the blaze at around 7.20am, after a dog walker spotted smoke coming from the baot

Firefighters found the man on board the boat, which was stationed at private moorings at Marsh Farm, Hilperton Marsh.

They managed to pull the man from the boat onto nearby land, but he was confirmed dead at the scene.
