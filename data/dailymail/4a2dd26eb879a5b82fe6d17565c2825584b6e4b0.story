Education Secretary Michael Gove said politicians had to do the right thing for their children

Voters must not ‘dare’ to criticise senior politicians who send their children to private schools, Education Secretary Michael Gove has warned.

The senior Tory leapt to the defence of Lib Dem leader Nick Clegg, who has admitted that he and wife Miriam and considering not enrolling their eldest son into a state secondary school.

Maria Hutchings, the Conservative candidate in tomorrow’s Eastleigh by-election has also faced criticism for saying her son needed to go to a private school to fulfil his ambition of becoming a surgeon.

But Mr Gove, who is responsible for 25,000 state schools in England, insisted politicians should be free to choose private education for their children.

‘I would defend anybody who makes any decision about a child's education in their interests,’ he told the Daily Telegraph.

‘I think it's terrible politics to drag people's children in and try to make an issue out of it.’

He added that many senior Labour figures had chosen to send their children to private schools.

‘There are all sorts of politicians from Diane Abott to Harriet Harman to Tony Blair who made the right decision for their kids. How dare people criticise a parent for doing what's best for their child?

‘If you try to get party political advantage out of a mother's love for their child that's just wrong.’

Last month Mr Clegg, the Deputy Prime Minister, signalled that he may send his eldest son to a private school, potentially sparking controversy about his commitment to state education.

The Deputy Prime Minister said he would put his children’s education first and would not overrule the wishes of his wife or son for ‘political reasons’.

Mr Clegg and his Spanish wife, Miriam Gonzalez Durantez, have looked around several schools, including the exclusive Catholic state school The London Oratory and a £30,000-a-year independent school.

David Cameron insisted he was ‘committed’ to sending his eldest daughter Nancy to a state school as in London ‘there’s a real improvement taking place’.

But Mr Clegg refused to make the same pledge when quizzed about his 11-year-old son Antonio, who is due to start secondary school in September.

Mr Gove defended Mr Clegg, and insisted politicians had to do the right thing for their children.

He said: ‘Nick Clegg should send his son to the right school for his son. I would absolutely defend him whatever he chose to do. A parent's first responsibility is to their child.

‘If it works out to send them to a good state (school) we will do so but, like all parents sending their children to secondary school in London, as you know there is huge competition for places.’
