Manchester United's players have been getting to know new boss Louis van Gaal and will be getting familiar with his personality and some of his managerial traits.

Here, Sportsmail has exclusive extracts from Maarten Meijer's explosive new book on the Dutchman which lifts the lid on the new man in charge at Old Trafford.

Louis van Gaal's march to the World Cup semi-finals began two years ago in a cosy hotel room with a blazing log fire.

That’s where the new Holland manager held a secret meeting with a key group of players and coaching staff to write the blueprint for their World Cup success.

High five! Holland reach the semi-finals of the World Cup under the stewardship of Louis van Gaal

It was a perfect match. The Dutch had 
limped away from Euro 2012 after a disastrous campaign in which they had
 hopelessly under-achieved.

Van Gaal still had the stain on his CV of being in charge of the side that failed even to qualify for the World Cup in 2002.

He had been out of work, had five operations to fix a hip but at the age of 61 was determined to make a success of his second chance.

Van Gaal had to set the record straight after his ill-fated first tenure as national manager; the team had a score to settle after Euro 2012.

He wanted to hear the views of the players and, after his first  training session with the national team, he set up a meeting at the Huis ter Duin hotel in Noordwijk, a regular haunt of Dutch teams, past and present.

‘It was a beautiful room with a wood fire,’ explained Van Gaal.

‘I had asked that they adjust the 
lighting. The chairs of the players were placed in a semi-circle, so 
that everybody could face each other.’

There were 13 in the room including Van 
Gaal. Trusted assistant Patrick Kluivert was definitely there and key 
players such as Robin van Persie and Arjen Robben almost certainly were,
 too. Van Gaal showed them some video clips, finishing with an interview
 with Wesley Sneijder just before Euro 2012.

Van Gaal revealed: ‘He said that a Dutch national team with so much quality couldn’t settle for anything less than the championship.

‘So then I asked: “So how is it possible that things went so differently?"

‘That turned into a conversation of two hours but I will not say anything more about it.’

Whatever was said, events in Brazil two years later suggest it worked to a tee.
