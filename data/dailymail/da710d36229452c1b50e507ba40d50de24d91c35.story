A former soldier has become the first person in Britain to undergo a pioneering keyhole kidney transplant. 

Brian Blanchard, 51, who had been suffering from kidney failure, was facing a lifetime of dialysis treatment until surgeons carried out operations last month that featured two breakthroughs in keyhole surgery techniques.

In the first, the organ – donated by Brian’s sister Pam Morphett – was removed through her groin rather than her abdomen, leaving her with a far less visible scar.

In the second, the kidney was inserted through an incision in Brian’s abdomen measuring just two and a half inches. Previously, a ten-inch opening would have been needed for the operation.

Surgeons say the new techniques pave the way for safer transplant operations, and to patients recovering more quickly.

Brian, from New Brighton, Merseyside, who now runs an engineering company owner, says he is proud to be the UK’s first patient for this procedure. 

‘The surgeon told me it would mean less pain and a quicker recovery,’ he says. 

‘To be honest, I was just delighted that my sister turned out to be a tissue and blood type match so was able to help. My scar is already barely visible – I’m amazed how they managed to insert the kidney through such a small hole. It’s only three weeks since the operation, and I’m already out walking the dog.’

His sister, 57, also from New Brighton, who is married with two grown-up children, was happy to spare Brian dialysis treatment but also delighted with her inconspicuous scar. 

‘I’m not vain, but the surgeon’s done a lovely job,’ she says. ‘The scar won’t be visible even when I’m in a swimming costume.’

The developments were made possible after surgeons at one of Britain’s largest kidney transplant units, at the Royal Liverpool Hospital, were given a masterclass in keyhole transplantation by Professor Pranjal Modi, visiting from India.

Prof Modi first developed a minimally invasive transplant in 2010 – a ‘scarless’ laparoscopic removal of the kidney through the belly button – and he has since carried out 172 at his hospital in Ahmedabad, northern India. 

But until last month, the procedure had not been performed anywhere else in the world. Prof Modi also perfected the skill of taking a donor organ out via the groin instead of higher up.

Both techniques are intended to boost recovery by reducing post-operative pain and the risk of infection, leading to patients leaving hospital sooner.

Sanjay Mehra, the transplant surgeon who brought Prof Modi to the UK, says: ‘The idea is to make a transplant a smaller and safer operation because we are working through a much smaller incision.

‘There are many operations that have now become minimally invasive, but the challenge with kidney transplantation is that we need to get the organ plumbed in within about an hour of it being taken out of its cooling storage box, which stops it from deteriorating while detached from the circulation.

‘The skill is getting stitching of the blood vessels and the ureter – the tube leading to the bladder – done within that time-frame using cameras to guide you. It’s not something that can be learned overnight and there is quite a steep learning curve, which is why only a handful of surgeons have learned this technique so far.

‘We are aiming to get the kidney into the patient in around 40 to 50 minutes. That’s a little longer than the quickest open transplants, but it’s possible as Professor Modi has shown.

‘It is worthwhile when you look at the size of Brian’s scar and the speed of his recovery.’ Although only a small incision is made, with four small holes nearby used to insert the keyhole instruments and camera, the space is made wider by surgical retractors. This allows the donor kidney – which measures about 5in by 2in – to be squeezed into place.

In most cases, the recipient’s own non-functioning kidneys remain in place, against the back muscles in the upper abdominal area, just below the ribcage. They sit opposite each other on both the left and right side of the body; the right kidney sits a little lower than the left to accommodate the size of the liver.

The new kidney is placed on the lower right or left side of the abdomen where it is connected to nearby blood vessels.

Placing the kidney in this position allows it to be easily connected to blood vessels and the bladder. 

‘Open surgery for transplants is a good operation but if we can safely modernise then we should,’ says Mr Mehra. ‘It benefits the patient, reduces some of the risks of infection, cuts post-surgical pain and gets them home and active more quickly.’

Brian, who is married with two teenage children, was the first of three patients to get the transplant. Twenty-five surgeons from all over Europe watched the operation. Mr Mehra has been to India to assist Prof Modi, and helped again with Brian’s operation, but has still to master the intricacies of speedy and safe suturing using the keyhole approach.

‘I am still learning the techniques on models in the lab, but I hope to be able to offer this to my patients in Liverpool next year,’ he says.

‘We will have to get approval from the hospital for it to be a routine operation here, and it has been agreed that Professor Modi will decide when I am ready.’

Brian has not only been spared a large incision in the abdomen, he was also given another bonus. The transplant team inserted his new kidney through an old appendix scar, sparing him a new scar.

He says: ‘I’m chuffed that I only have one scar and not two. The surgeons did a fantastic job and I’m full of admiration for their skill.’

Currently, a third of donor kidneys come from a living friend, relative or, much more rarely, a stranger in an ‘altruistic donation’. 

At any one time there are 5,600 patients on the waiting list for a new kidney. About 3,250 transplants are carried out each year.
