Defense attorneys for Vanderbilt rapist Brandon Vandenburg are fighting to have his conviction overturned after it emerged that one of the jurors failed to disclose they had been a victim of rape.

Fletcher Long is filing a motion to have the verdict thrown out after learning that one of the jurors who convicted Vandenburg on Tuesday was sexually assaulted 20 years ago, WTVF reported.

The jury in Nashville, Tennessee convicted Vandenburg, 21, and his former Vanderbilt football teammate Cory Batey, 21, of gang-raping an unconscious student in a dorm room in June 2013.

Long said he wants to know if the juror lied during the selection process. 

'It would've been useful to know this information in a case that had some of the same types of scenarios and allegations to which [the juror] had been a victim,' Long told WTVF on Thursday.

Attorney: Vandenburg's lawyer Fletcher Long says he wants to find out if the juror lied during selection

'It's incredible they didn't think that information was warranted. It could cause a mistrial, it could cost the entire case.'

But an attorney for the state, Davidson County District Attorney Glenn Funk, told the station that he does not think the situation will warrant a mistrial.

The issue will be discussed at the men's sentencing hearing on March 6, when they face between 15 and 60 years in prison.

Batey was found guilty of four counts of aggravated rape, two counts of aggravated sexual battery and one count of attempted aggravated rape on Tuesday.

Vandenburg was found guilty of the same charges, as well as one count each unlawful photography and tampering with evidence. 

It took the jurors just three hours to convict the men.

On Thursday, three of the jurors spoke out to that they made their decisions early on in the case after seeing cell phone footage of the attack.

'As soon as we saw the videos and photographic evidence... we knew exactly who was guilty of what and what we were going to come back with,' Todd Easter told ABC News.

Easy decision: Jurors (from left), Dr Deirdre Young, Todd Easter and Dr. Corbi Milligan said they knew they had to convict Vandenburg and Batey when they saw sickening cell phone footage of the attack

'What we knew is that a terrible crime had occurred.'

Another juror, Dr. Deirde Young, said watching the footage - which showed Vandenburg egging on Batey and two other men as the woman lay unconscious - made her feel 'awful.'

'I asked myself, "how could they do this to that young lady?"' Young added.

'There can't be enough explanation to me. I don't know, I think they need to do some real soul searching. I've never experienced anything like these young men.' 

They said the case was extremely emotional for them, and they all 'crumbled' when they retired to the jury room, Young said.

In the trial, the victim had testified that Vandenburg, whom she was dating, plied her with alcohol one night in June 2013 and the next thing she remembers is waking up in a strange dorm room.

After dragging her to his dorm room, Vandenburg switched on porn and encouraged Batey and two others to assault the woman with a water bottle and rape her, prosecutors said.

The jury was shown graphic cell phone footage of part of the sexual attack, which the men had recorded. Vandenburg then sent some footage to friends. 

One of the men, Brandon Banks, allegedly anally raped the woman with the water bottle as Vandenburg said, 'squeeze that s***', the video showed. Batey then allegedly urinated on her.

'It wasn't just about sexual gratification and fun, it was about degrading her, humiliating her,' Deputy District Attorney Tom Thurman said in his closing arguments on Tuesday. 

Throughout the trial, the defense had argued that the men had become swept up in a promiscuous college culture, where people walked around naked and binged on alcohol. 

'Thank you to everyone who has supported me throughout this difficult process. I'm thankful that the criminal justice system will hold the defendants responsible for their violent crimes. 

'The hard work of the law enforcement officers, prosecutors and victims' advocates who dedicated so many months of their lives to this case has made justice possible.

'I want to especially thank detective Jason Mayo, Sgt. Mike Shreeve, Detective Chad Gish, Deputy District Attorney Tom Thurman, Assistant District Attorneys Jan Norman and Roger Moore and victims' advocates Wanda Swan, Lt. Rochelle Barrios and Teresa Shearon. You are my heroes and I am so proud of and grateful for each of you.

'I am also hopeful that the publicity this case has received will lead to a discussion of how we can end sexual violence on college campuses.

'Finally, I want to remind other victims of sexual violence: You are not alone. You are not to blame.'

But Thurman said that was not the culture that was revealed during the trial.

'The culture you really saw was entitled athletes thinking rules don't apply to them, that's the real culture you saw here,' he told the court on Tuesday. 'Their mindset that they could get away with anything. 'The rules don't apply to us'.'

Defense attorneys had also argued that Batey had consumed too much alcohol to be in control of his actions, while Vandenburg had not actually penetrated the woman because he was unable to. 

But the jury's mind was made up.  

As the verdict was announced, Batey sat emotionless as the jury read their verdict, while Vandenburg shook his head and rolled his eyes, in compete disbelief over the jury's decision.

Vandenburg's father could be heard crying out as the guilty charges were read against his son according to WSMV.

The victim was also in the courtroom for the verdict, and began crying as the two men were declared guilty on all counts.

A statement from the victim was read afterwards to the courtroom, in which she said; 'Thank you to everyone who has supported me throughout this difficult process. I'm thankful that the criminal justice system will hold the defendants responsible for their violent crimes.

'I am also hopeful that the publicity this case has received will lead to a discussion of how we can end sexual violence on college campuses. Finally, I want to remind other victims of sexual violence: You are not alone. You are not to blame.'

'Attackers': Jaborian 'Tip' McKenzie, left, and Brandon Banks, right, are also accused in the rape case

Vanderbilt released a statement as well in which Vice Chancellor Beth Fortune said; 'Our heart goes out to the victim. Her testimony was forceful and brave. She has received our care and support.'

She then added; 'The safety and security of our students is Vanderbilt's top priority. Sexual violence will never be tolerated. Incidents will be investigated, victims will be supported, and perpetrators will be punished.' 

Both men were immediately taken in following the verdict to await sentencing.

Two other men, Jaborian 'Tip' McKenzie and Brandon Banks, have also been charged in the incident but a trial date for their case has not yet been announced. 

Aggravated rape is punishable by 15 to 80 years in jail, while aggravated sexual battery is punishable by 8 to 30 years in jail.

Vandenburg also faces up to 6 years for the unlawful photography charge and 15 years for tampering with evidence.
