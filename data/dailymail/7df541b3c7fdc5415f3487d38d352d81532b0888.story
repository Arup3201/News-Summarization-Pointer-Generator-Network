A devoted teen whose mother died after a cancer battle is keeping her memory alive - by finishing a guide she had started to write for her husband on how to raise her daughters.

Emily Worthington, 13, has vowed to finish the guide started by her mother Lucy, who died on November 6 after an eight year battle with cancer.

The 41-year-old mother-of-four wanted to leave an instruction manual for husband Mark, 45, telling him how to look after their four girls.

Tragically, she passed away before she could finish the booklet for Emily, 13, Katie, 10, and twins Keziah and Lillia, both eight.

But eldest daughter Emily is set to keep
 her mother's legacy alive by writing down all the tips she learned from
 her mother - like how to style her siblings’ hair, and how to help them
 get through puberty.

Mark, from Derby, said: 'Lucy got so weak that she wasn’t able to finish the book but she chatted about what she wanted to write and Emily knows so many different little things that she used to do.

'She wanted to make memory boxes for each of the girls too and got them started, but now it is up to us to fill them with more memories.

'She wrote letters to the girls too asking them not to be angry that she had died but to understand that she was in a better place now.

'Emily has so many traits of her mum and can handle the three younger girls when they’re fighting or when they’re upset.'

Emily
 doesn't want to take the place of her mother but wants to make sure 
that her younger sisters never forget all that their mother did.

Lucy, 41, died on November 6 after an eight year battle with cancer

What Lucy had written:

How to deal with headlice

What to do when puberty hits

Funeral arrangements

Jewellery to give to four daughters

What Emily will add:

How to plait hair

How to paint nails

Birthday present plan

Getting organised for school

She
 now helps her father style their hair in the morning and reminds him of 
all the little things that Lucy used to do such as marking birthdays on 
calendars and helping organise things for school.

As well as tips on how to deal with 
obstacles in life there were also strict instructions on her funeral 
arrangements and what jewellery to give to each of the girls.

Mark
 said: 'When she knew her life was almost over, Lucy turned to me and 
said ‘make sure the girls know that I fought to be with them for as long
 as I could.

'My wife lived
 for the girls. Every new treatment the doctors could find she would 
try, just to have as long and full a life as she could have with them.

'That
 was the sort of woman she was, selfless, caring and the sort of woman 
who always put other people before herself, no matter how ill she was.'

Emily said: 'I miss my mum a lot but I know that dad and the other girls need me too.

'Dad
 doesn’t know how to plait hair or do anything girly so we have to teach
 him, if that means that he has to have his nails painted then that is 
something he just has to face.

'I
 need to make sure that he picks nice clothes for us all as mum always 
wanted us to look our best, but as long as he takes us shopping with him
 I’m sure he can pick some nice things.

'I
 remember all the little things that mum used to do, just things that 
made her a little special, and I want to make sure that the girls learn 
all of those too and never forget the things mum did for us.

'Christmas is going to be strange 
without her because we had so many different things that she used to do 
and not having her here is going to feel odd.

'I was angry at first that she had gone but now I understand that it was better for her to not be in pain.'

Three weeks after Lucy gave birth to her twin daughters, she found a lump in her breast - and was diagnosed with cancer.

Mark said: 'I remember being told it was cancer and I just broke down but Lucy stayed strong and just listened.

'We had three-week-old twins and two young daughters waiting for us at home. We couldn’t believe it.'

Emily (far right) said: 'Dad doesn't know how to plait hair or do anything girly so we have to teach him, if that means that he has to have his nails painted then that is something he just has to face.'

Lucy
 decided that a mastectomy was her only choice and just three months 
after the birth of her twins she faced painful rounds of chemotherapy as
 she recovered.

Mark, who works for Rolls Royce, said his wife had a mastectomy so she could be near their children.

She
 said: 'She felt as if she was missing out on things like taking the 
girls swimming and being able to do lots of things with them.

'She did it for the girls, that was what she was like, always thinking of what she could do for the girls.'

For the next five years the couple attended regular check-ups hoping that Lucy was successful in her battle but after complaining of pains in her chest scans found she had bone cancer.

Mark said: 'We were devastated that it had returned. We didn’t hide it from the girls but we were careful about what we said to them.

'Having to tell them ‘mummy has cancer again’ was heartbreaking. By then Emily was older and understood a bit more and simply asked "can you die from cancer?’" This broke our hearts as we just didn’t know what to tell her.'

Husband Mark said: 'Life will never be the same without her but I have four incredible girls that I have to live for, I promised Lucy that I would do that for her.'

In her final few days Lucy was taken to hospital and handed Mark the guide that outlined what he would need to do.

While the book was not finished she also managed to write letters to her daughters asking them not to be angry or hurt that she had died.

Mark, who married Lucy in 1997, said: 'She wanted to write so much more but she just didn’t have the time or the strength to get it done.

'Lucy didn’t want the girls to feel any anger that she had been taken away from them so soon, she just wanted them to know that she loved them dearly and wanted to spend as much time with them as she could.

'Emily is a teenager and at the age where she is angry that her mum had gone but Lucy didn’t want that for her, and so she encouraged us all to start counselling.

'Emily wrote a poem to read out at Lucy’s funeral that showed just how much she would miss her mum, it took a lot of courage for her to do that.

'Life will never be the same without her but I have four incredible girls that I have to live for, I promised Lucy that I would do that for her.'

I lost a mummy with a heart of gold,

A mummy who’s smile I will always hold,

I’ll miss the way you tuck me in at night when I was upset you would hug me tight,

You never had to speak for me to know you cared,

That unspoken bond was just something that we shared,

Making me laugh was something you were good at too,

The smile in your face cheered me up when I was feeling blue,

Sneaking off to McDonald’s when daddy wasn’t there, he might laugh now or give me that stare,

These were all the funny times, the best when you were here,

Although this has all changed I will still remember it dear,

Shopping with you is another memory I will hold close,

The fun and laughter we had with this I will always raise a toast,

Remember that milk shake we had that froze straight through our chests,

Even though it was so cold it was still the best,

When I used to struggle in school, you would know just how to help me through, I will miss that terribly about you,

But
 I know you’ll be my guardian angel mummy being there when I need you 
around guiding me through life as I will be getting older now,

All these memories and so many more, I will always hold on to,

But I know you haven’t left even though it may seem so,

I know you’re in heaven and closer than we all know,

No need to worry so much about me mummy and I will try not to worry to because you’re safe and happy which makes me happy too,

I know you’ll be with me mummy wherever I may go,

God is looking after you now but I’ll never forget you so.
