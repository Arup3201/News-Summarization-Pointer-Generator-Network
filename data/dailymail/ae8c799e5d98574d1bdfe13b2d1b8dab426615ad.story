The father of Prince William’s friend Jecca Craig has been accused of callously dragging out a court case after a tourist was skewered by a rampaging elephant on the wildlife estate he runs in Kenya.

Wendy Martin has spent 14 years fighting for justice after suffering horrific injuries during the attack.

The elephant’s tusks pierced her torso from front to back, destroying one of her kidneys. The animal then tossed her in the air, dragged her battered body through the bush and knelt on her, its three-ton weight shattering her pelvis.

Wendy Martin was on holiday with her husband and three children when she was gored so badly by a rampaging elephant that her intestines were left hanging out

Last week, she finally settled her long-running legal battle for an undisclosed sum. Defendants including Ian Craig had previously appealed a ruling that found them guilty of negligence and ordered them to pay more than £500,000 in damages.

In an exclusive interview, Mrs Martin, who has spent £100,000 in legal fees fighting her case, told The Mail on Sunday: ‘Frankly, it’s extraordinary I’m still alive, but I was branded as some kind of gold-digger.

‘I believe he hoped I would give up and go away but I wanted to know why it happened and to try to ensure no one else suffers a similar fate.’

She was attacked when on holiday at the Il Ngwesi Lodge in 2000 with her husband Steve, a British diplomat, and their children, Matthew, then aged ten, Rosanna, eight, and Emily, four.

They had been living in Nairobi for four years and had been to the lodge – described as a ‘wilderness experience with little or no game’ – twice before and felt comfortable there.

Mrs Martin, a physiotherapist from Godalming, Surrey, had been invited on an early-morning run by a guide when, with two other guests, they encountered an elephant protecting its young.

The guide first told them to stop, but then shouted ‘run’ and they scattered.

Mrs Martin later learned that had they stayed together, they would have had more chance of frightening the animal away – and also that the party were just 300 yards from the safety of the lodge.

She said: ‘I remember every heart-stopping moment. I tripped and the guide hauled me, then I was running for my life. I could hear the elephant closing in on me. It had huge tusks and its ears were flapping.’

Terrified, she dived under a bush and curled into a ball.

‘Next thing I knew, its head was butting into me and I could hear the sound of its tusks slicing through the earth around me.

It pushed me about 60 yards through the bush, its tusks piercing my body before it picked me up and tossed me into the air.

‘When I landed, I can remember thinking that I must play dead in the hope it would stop. Thankfully, it worked. The elephant disappeared into the bush with a snort.’

Wendy was horrifically wounded. The tusks pierced her body from  front to back in four places, destroying her kidney and narrowly missing vital organs.

Wendy recalls: ‘I was in excruciating pain. I looked down at my body and I’ll never forget the horrific sight.

'There were holes everywhere and out of my side spilled a mass of blood and flesh. I knew from the medical training I’d done as a physiotherapist that it was my intestines.

‘One of my first thoughts was that I needed to get covered up as I was getting cold despite the rising heat of the African bush, and that I was going to be die of shock.’

Incredibly, none of the lodge staff seemed to have any medical training. Realising that she was very seriously wounded, Wendy knew it was important to stay conscious, to stay alive.

As lodge staff radioed Mr Craig for help, Wendy’s husband, who had been inside with their children, rushed to the scene.

The distraught couple began to say their final farewell to each other and Wendy asked Steve to say goodbye to the children.

But she clung on for about 30 minutes until Mr Craig arrived with two planes and a private nurse who had been caring for one of his friends with terminal cancer.

Wendy was flown to a bush hospital an hour away, but doctors declared her injuries were too severe to treat with their limited facilities.

She was then sent on to Nairobi, arriving in hospital four hours after the attack. It took surgeons six hours to stabilise her condition.

Her list of injuries includes a destroyed kidney, which was removed, multiple fractures to her pelvis and bones in her lower back, broken ribs and wounds to the abdomen, lumbar areas and legs.

Doctors warned her family to expect the worst. ‘I remember feeling certain that I would die from my injuries. Every time I opened my eyes, I  was astonished I was still alive,’ Wendy says.

‘The hardest part for me came four days later when the children came to visit for the first time, it still makes me tearful to think about it now.

‘I’d never been parted from them before, and they arrived to see my face swollen with bruises and my body hooked up to all sorts of machines.

'The three children just stood at my bedside and cried. They were very distressed and the look of trauma and pain etched on their faces will stay with me forever.’

After ten days Wendy, who had private health insurance, was flown back to the UK where she spent a further three months in hospital. But her shattered body required more delicate surgery.

She risked paralysis during an operation to pin her pelvis back together with ten-inch metal screws and suffered from two lumbar and two abdominal hernias.

The wound in her left leg also became infected, opening up to a point where it was gaping eight inches wide.

‘At one stage, I feared I was going to have to have my leg amputated,’ she says. ‘It was a very hard time for me.

‘I had to focus on my life hour by hour. I was in constant excruciating pain and there always seemed to be something else going wrong, meaning I had to be rushed back into hospital. It was very difficult with three children to look after.’

The once active and fit mother found that a good day meant hobbling around on a walking frame or using a wheelchair.

Even after the wounds started to heal, she struggled to come to terms with her new body.

‘I felt like a mangled wreck,’ she says. ‘I’d always been very proud of my figure, I went to the gym and ate healthily,’ she says.

‘My body is covered with large ugly scars. At first I didn’t feel entirely comfortable wearing swimwear because people do stare at my scars, but now they are badges of my survival that I wear with pride.’

It took an astonishing three years of legal correspondence before it even emerged that there was no insurance at the lodge.

‘It was obvious to us that Mr Craig was distancing himself from what had happened,’ said Mrs Martin.

‘I had no idea at the time that he was a powerful landowner.

‘It’s been incredibly difficult watching his business and influence grow through his royal and society connections while he wouldn’t take responsibility for what had happened to me.’

Mr Craig – whose daughter Jecca was with Prince William on a controversial boar hunt in Spain last week – is a shareholder in Il Ngwesi Lodge as well as its managing director and owner of the adjacent Lewa Wildlife Conservancy, where the Prince  proposed to Kate Middleton in 2010.

Mr Craig and the two companies were found guilty of negligence in 2007 – which they appealed.

During the long legal battle, it emerged that the lodge manager and Mr Craig knew a herd of elephant with young had been reported nearby.

Mr Craig argued that a ruling against him would damage conservation efforts but Mrs Martin, now 53, said: ‘This case has nothing to do with conservation. It’s about having a duty of care to paying guests.

‘Neither was it about money. I felt a responsibility to try to prevent another family enduring such a horrific experience.

‘This ruling sends a message to every lodge in Kenya and has changed the law there for the better. Lewa now publishes a list of safety regulations, one of which says guests are not allowed out on foot without armed guides.’

When asked to comment last night, Ian Craig directed The Mail on  Sunday to a statement on the Lewa website, which stated: ‘On February 10, Il Ngwesi Company Ltd, the Lewa Wildlife Conservancy and Ian Craig settled, for an undisclosed sum, the damages awarded to Mrs Wendy Martin and withdrew their appeal.

'This brings to an end the legal proceedings in the case.’
