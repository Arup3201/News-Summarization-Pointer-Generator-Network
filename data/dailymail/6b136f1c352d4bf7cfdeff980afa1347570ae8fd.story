Drunk at work: Richard Pease, 50, of Cowes, Isle of Wight, pleaded guilty to being a master of a hovercraft having consumed excess alcohol

A hovercraft pilot was today facing the sack after admitting to being nearly three times over the drink-drive limit while in charge of a vessel carrying 36 people.

Richard Pease, 50, of Cowes, Isle of Wight, pleaded guilty to being a master of a hovercraft having consumed excess alcohol.

The experienced pilot was responsible for driving the vessel during a five-mile journey across the Solent from Portsmouth to Ryde on June 22.

But a colleague had to step in and take over the controls when Pease fell ill at the controls of the 127-seater Hovertravel Freedom 90 vehicle.

Tests revealed he had been drinking and had 96 micrograms of alcohol in 100 millilitres of breath. The legal drink-drive limit is 35 micrograms.

The case has been adjourned for sentencing at Isle of Wight Crown Court on October 10 and Peace has been released on unconditional bail.

Pease, wearing a navy suit and blue tie, pleaded not guilty to two further charges of driving a vehicle while his alcohol level was above the limit and not complying with requirements of the International Safety Management Code.

Sunyana Sharma, prosecuting, told Honorary Judge Linda Sullivan QC the pleas were acceptable as the initial two charges were put in place because it was thought the Railways and Transport Safety Act did not include hovercrafts.

She said at an earlier hearing: 'The defendant was the master and pilot of the Hovercraft Freedom 90. He is an experienced driver. On the day in question... he was the individual in sole control of the hovercraft and driving.'

Neil Fitzgibben, defending, said: ‘Mr Pease has an unblemished character. He has been a hovercraft pilot for nearly 20 years. I will present some character references in due course.’

Hovertravel provides the fastest way to cross the Solent with a journey time of less than ten minutes. It operates two hovercrafts and has carried more than 26million passengers since opening in 1965.

Hovertravel is the world’s longest-running commercial hovercraft service and is the only scheduled passenger service in Europe.

Modern hovercraft were developed in the 1950s by British inventor Sir Christopher Cockerell. They float on a cushion of air allowing them to travel over water and flat land surfaces.

The steering of the craft is controlled by rudders, which are located in the slipstream behind each propeller. The captain can also use the propellers to change the direction of the craft.

A spokesman for Hovertravel refused to comment until after Pease has been sentenced.
