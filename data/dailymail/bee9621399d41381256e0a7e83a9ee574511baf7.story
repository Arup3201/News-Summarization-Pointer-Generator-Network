Enchanted: An perfectly, or terribly, placed animated promo turned Sunday's Once Upon a Time into something not to family friendly

Sunday night’s episode of Once Upon a Time gave an unexpected viral advertising boost after an animated promo jumped right into a star’s crotch.

As Ginnifer Goodwin’s character Snow White appeared onscreen, an animated rabbit jumps out to advertise ABC’s upcoming Once Upon A Time In Wonderland.

‘You're searching for something powerful enough to vanquish the queen,’ Snow White said, just as the enchanted promo created a perfectly placed magic rabbit hole and disappeared into her pelvis.

Instagram user russfrushtick posted a short video of the hilarious moment and the perfectly timed accident has gone viral.

While inadvertent, the marketing boost comes at a welcome time for the new show, which debuts Thursday at 8pm.

The creators of both Once Upon a Time and its spin off responded to the hilarious gaffe with fitting humor.

‘I never thought I would have so many emails about Ginny’s vagina,’ showrunner Edward Kitsis told Entertainment Weekly.
‘It’s embarrassing, but at the same time, it’s so silly it’s hard to 
take serious. It’s so obvious that somebody didn’t realize what they 
were doing.’ 

Bad timing? As Snow White, played by Ginnifer Goodwin spoke, a white rabbit advertising the show's new spinoff series put an enchanted rabbit hole directly onto her crotch

The rabbit was promoting Once Upon a Time in Wonderland, a spinoff about Alice and the gang, and the gaffe has gone viral

Kitsis’s partner Adam Horowitz agreed.

‘We’re grateful ABC is spending so much time promoting both shows, but it was an interesting cross-promotion,’ Horowitz joked.

Even the woman at the center of the newly dubbed ‘magic crotch’ promo was able to have fun with it.

‘Dear @EW, it's just a @OnceABC + @WonderlandOUAT crotchover!’ tweeted Goodwin, ‘And I'm not viral.’
