The next phase in the hunt for missing Malaysia Airlines flight MH370 is under way after a ship with specialised sonar equipment began searching in the area where the plane is thought to have crashed.

The Boeing 777 disappeared with 239 people on March 8 after veering dramatically off course between Kuala Lumpur and Beijing. The plane is thought to have been flying on autopilot at the time.

Experts believe the plane crashed about 1,100 miles off the Western Australia coast, which is where the Malaysia-contracted GO Phoenix vessel began hunting for traces of wreckage or jet fuel today.

The GO Phoenix will be joined later this month by two ships sent by Dutch contractor Fugro as part of an operation that could last more than a year.

Search: The GO Phoenix will be joined later this month by two ships sent by Dutch contractor Fugro as part of an operation that could last more than a year 

Fugro Discovery (pictured), which along with the Malaysian-contracted GO Phoenix, will soon start a new  high-resolution search for missing Malaysia Airlines flight MH370

Australia's Joint Agency Co-ordination Centre said GO Phoenix will conduct operations in the area for about 12 days before sailing to Fremantle Port to be resupplied.

Fugro Equator, which is currently using sonar techology to search the sea floor, is likely to be used as a general search vessel when it finishes carrying out bathymetric tests later this month.

More than 68,000 square miles of the search area has been analysed and mapped so far and a massive land and sea search has failed to find any trace of the plane.

GO Phoenix, the first of the vessels contracted to conduct the underwater search, departed Jakarta in Indonesia more than a week ago, after work was done to prepare the ship for the sea and weather conditions it would encounter.

It began its search today, deploying underwater sonar on the end of five mile long cable that will enable it to scan the area from within 100 metres of the ocean floor.

The signals the ship receives back can then give a detailed reading of the sea floor mile by mile.  

The new stage of the search comes after months of detailed analysis and sea bed surveys, which has indicated the aircraft should be found along a defined arc in the southern Indian Ocean, where it's believed to have run out of fuel. 

The primary search zone - dubbed the 'priority area' - is an arc 23,000 square miles in size - the size of Croatia - 1,120 miles off Australia's coast.

One of the key issues the search team is likely to come up against over the next few months is unpredictable weather.

Although the area is currently calm, huge storms and swells can emerge seemingly out of nowhere. Such conditions can badly disrupt the location of the underwater sonar cables.

These images show remnants of volcanoes, towering ridges and deep trenches that have been discovered on the seabed of the search area named Broken Ridge, an extensive linear, mountainous sea floor structure

This bathymetric survey image shows that the depth of the sea floor in one area of the search site is -5300 metres below sea level (purple) and then rises steeply to -2500 metres below sea level (red)

Vessels will also be joining GO Phoenix including Furgo Discovery which has completed fit out works in Durban, South Africa and is en-route to Australia where it is expected to arrive in Fremantle on Sunday.   

Furgo Equator, the vessel currently being used to survey the search area, is expected to be mobilised as a search vessel when its bathymetric work is complete around the end of October.

'It's not clear how long that search will take,' Australia's Transport Minister Warren Truss told the Australian Broadcasting Corporation. 

`We would hope, obviously, to find the aircraft on the first day, but it could in fact take a year to search the entire area and weather conditions will have an impact,' he added. 

Very few marine surveys have taken place in the MH370 search area. Previous mapping did not show the shape of the sea floor and only indicated ocean depth

The area being searched for MH370 has been narrowed down to a 60,000 square kilometre arc (grey) in the southern Indian Ocean, 1800km off the Australian coast

The search operation is a joint effort by Australia and Malaysia costing £31million.

There has been many theories as to what happened to the Malaysian Airlines flight MH370 but there's been increased interest on the pilot, Zaharie Ahmad Shah who reportedly used a flight simulator at his home to plot a path to a remote island. 

All 12 members of staff on board the flight - including both pilots - were Malaysian nationals.

Of the 227 passengers, 152 were Chinese citizens, including a group of 19 artists with six family members and four staff returning from a calligraphy exhibition of their work in Kuala Lumpur.

38 passengers were Malaysian, while the remaining 37 passengers were made up of individuals from the U.S., France, Australia, Canada, New Zealand, Russia, the Netherlands, India, Ukraine, Russia, Taiwan and Indonesia.
