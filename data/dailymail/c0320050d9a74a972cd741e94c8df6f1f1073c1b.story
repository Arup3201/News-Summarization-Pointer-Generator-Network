Environmental campaigners Greenpeace have attacked Lego for partnering with Shell in a viral video showing the a toy brick version of the Arctic being drowned in a tide of oil.

The clip, constructed by filming elaborate scenes made entirely of Lego, first shows a happy Arctic scene featuring polar bears and Inuit fisherman.

But Shell-branded trucks and oil rigs soon arrive on the scene, bringing a dark tone to proceedings as wildlife and even people are gradually drowned in a tide of black sludge.

Drowning in oil: The video shows an idyllic Arctic scene constructed entirely out of Lego, which is drowned in oil

In the background, a slower, poignant version of Everything Is Awesome, an upbeat song used in the smash-hit Lego movie, is played.

The video is an attempt to mobilise support against Shell by making Lego drop their association with the oil company.

Greenpeace also launched a petition alongside the video, which has amassed around 320,000 signatures.

In response to the campaign, a Lego spokesman told the Guardian that the company wants to make 'a positive impact' on the environment.

He added that its partnership with Shell is just another way to get its toys to more children.
