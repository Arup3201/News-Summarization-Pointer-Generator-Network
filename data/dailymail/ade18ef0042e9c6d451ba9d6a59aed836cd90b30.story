As traffic in the park built up, the pride caused a tailback of excited sightseers.

Mr and Mrs Campbell-Harris captured the scene just before 6am.

Mr Campbell-Harris, 47, who runs a real estate company, said: 'We were the only car there at the time and as it was early in the morning they were just waking up.

'We watched as the cubs became more playful - it was difficult to know what to focus on as there was so much activity going on.

'Eventually cars started arriving from the opposite side and the expected traffic jam began.'

The couple from Somerset West, Western Cape, in South Africa were celebrating their 26th wedding anniversary with a trip to the park.

They were treated to an adorable display as the playful cubs frolicked oblivious to the traffic building up.

Mr Campbell-Harris said: 'It is difficult to describe the feeling of being with wild animals so close, you feel so privileged and it does wonders for your soul.

'We always feel a connection with the cats - we can say that they don't look at us, but rather look into us.'

Mr Campbell-Harris entered the park at 5.30am in the hope of seeing big cats dozing on the warm tar road.

Mr Campbell-Harris said: 'There were some really inquisitive cubs that came right up to our car.

'The lionesses started getting restless and, amazingly, they walked right toward our car and into the grass.

'We were the only car fortunate enough to have any visual of the little cubby heads above the long grass as they walked away.

'The excitement of seeing something in the road as you approach it is not something you can explain.

'The adrenalin high is what keeps us going back time after time.'
