David Cameron pledged to crack down on fixed odds betting machines, dubbed the ‘crack cocaine’ of the High street yesterday.

The Prime Minister branded the machines, on which punters can lose up to £300 a minute, ‘a problem’ and called for cross party support for action when a review of the dangers reports back in the Spring.

Mr Cameron intervened after Labour forced a vote in the House of Commons on plans outlined by Ed Miliband to give councils more powers to restrict the spread of the machines, which carry electronic roulette.

Problem: David Cameron has acknowledged there should be action over the fixed-odds machines on which people can lose up to £300 a minute

MPs last night voted to reject Labour’s plans by a majority of 82.

But the Prime Minister said Mr Miliband had a ‘reasonable point’ when he said the machines were harming families and communities but also called for councils to use existing powers more rigorously if they have a problem.

As a first move, Culture Minister Helen Grant used the debate to announce that the betting industry will introduce new controls on high-stakes betting machines at the end of March.

She told the Commons she has challenged the five largest UK bookmakers to implement precautionary player protection measures on the machines.

‘There’s going to be precautionary protections placed by the industry at the end of March and then we will do whatever is needed to make sure people are protected.

'I challenged them to develop a plan to link players with play in a way that allows us to better understand player behaviour and to assess the effectiveness of harm mitigation measures.’

She added: ‘I’m not prepared to delay taking action.’ According to the Gambling Commission, there are more than 33,000 of the fixed odds terminals making over £1.2 billion every year.

While the Gambling Act 2005 limited the terminals to four per betting shop, Labour says bookmakers have simply opened more branches to get around the restrictions.

Mr Cameron told MPs: ‘This is a problem, it does need looking at, we have a review under way. Frankly we are clearing up a situation that was put in place under the last government but I think if we work together we can probably sort it out.

‘I think you are making a reasonable point but first we’ll just deal with the facts. Councils already have powers to tackle the issues and I believe that councils should make full use of that power. I’m not arguing that is job done, there may well be more to do.’

Labour claims action could be taken before the review by putting betting shops in a separate class of building use so councils can use planning powers to restrict new premises opening.

Mr Miliband disputed the Prime Minister’s claim that councils have the power to tackle the spread of the machines. 

He said London mayor Boris Johnson and the Conservative chairman of the Local Government Association had both called for local authorities to be given more powers.

‘One in three calls to the gambling helpline is about these machines and they are clustered in deprived areas,’ said Mr Miliband.

The bookmakers appeared to give ground 
last night. Neil Goulden, Chairman of the Association of British 
Bookmakers, said: ‘We accept that there are concerns about gaming 
machines and are always open to a constructive dialogue with politicians
 about the appropriate powers for local authorities.

Ed Miliband has said that one in three calls to the gambling helpline is about automated machines which are clustered in deprived areas

‘The betting industry does not target deprived areas and is committed to doing everything it can to help society tackle problem gambling.

'That is why we are cooperating in full with the government review already underway. It is also the reason why we recently brought forward a new code of conduct for player protection and responsible gambling.’

Representatives from the gambling industry are due to meet ministers at the end of this month to detail what progress they have made in fulfilling Ms Grant’s requests.

Tory MP Philip Davies, an ally of the bookmaking industry, attacked Labour for condemning pursuits enjoyed by the poor.

He said: ‘This is basically middle-class people being patronising to working-class people, telling them that they know best on how they should spend their money.’

But Gareth Wallace, public affairs adviser for The Salvation Army, demanded immediate action: ‘The government already possesses sufficient evidence to take action on highly addictive gambling machines and local authorities lack adequate powers to say no to betting shops.

‘Every year in the UK people lose more than £1 billion on FOBTs; problem gamblers lose nearly £300 million a year on these machines.

'We believe these official statistics clearly demonstrate that these gambling machines are a problem which demands action.’
