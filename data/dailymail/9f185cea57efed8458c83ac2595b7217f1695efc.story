A four-year-old boy has died after a mirror fell on his head at the Bicester Village fashion outlet in Oxfordshire.

The boy was injured in the Hugo Boss store at the shopping centre on Tuesday evening and taken to John Radcliffe Hospital in Oxford.

He died in the early hours of this morning following four days of hospital treatment.

Police are appealing to shoppers who may have seen the incident at the Huge Boss store

The boy's family were shopping when the tragedy occurred at 8.40pm on Tuesday night.

An off-duty doctor treated him until emergency services arrived at the store.

Police said the boy will not be named until
his relatives have been told of his death.

Thames Valley Police has issued an appeal for witnesses to come forward to help the investigation

into the death.

A spokesman said: 'We are still at the very early stages of this investigation, and no one has been arrested.

'From my understanding the boy was with his family. This is a very sensitive investigation and there is limited information that we can give out at this stage.'

Investigating officer Det Insp Steve Duffy said: 'Our thoughts are with the family at this time.

'We are currently investigating the 
circumstances of this boy's death and we would ask anyone who was in the
Hugo Boss store at around that time on Tuesday to please contact us as a
matter of urgency.'

A post-mortem examination is to be carried out this week and an inquest will be opened.

Oxfordshire County Council's Environmental Health department will work with police to investigate the death of the boy.

The Health and Safety Executive said that they were not involved in the investigation as shops are the responsibility of local authorities.

On the Hugo Boss store's website, a notice said: 'Please note that the Hugo Boss boutique is temporarily closed. We are sorry for any inconvenience.'

A company spokesman refused last night to reveal the size of the mirror or give details of how it fell and whether it fell from height.

He said: 'Everyone at Hugo Boss is devastated by this tragic accident and we would like to extend our deepest condolences and sympathies to his family.Â  All of our thoughts are with them at this time.'

He added that the store would remain closed until further notice and the company was assisting the authorities in their investigations.

The Bicester Village also published a strikingly similar statement.

It said: 'Everyone at Bicester Village is deeply saddened by this tragic accident. We send our heartfelt condolences to the family and our thoughts and prayers are with them.

'The matter is now under investigation and there is no further comment at this time.'
