A word of warning. When you leave the house today, don’t forget your coat – or you’ll be in for a rather chilly shock.

The Indian summer we have been enjoying will come to an abrupt end this morning, forecasters predict, with the country waking up to a ‘short, sharp shock’ of cold, windy weather.

There could even be some ground frost in parts of northern Britain, as temperatures fall as low as freezing overnight.

It will also be blustery, with winds reaching 60mph on the east coast. The gusts could cause disruption along coastal roads as waves breach sea walls, causing flooding.

The Met Office issued a severe weather warning affecting the East Midlands, East of England, North East England and Yorkshire and Humber regions, and urged people to avoid coastal paths in the affected areas.

Met Office forecaster Dan Williams said: ‘Compared to the last few days it will really feel a fair few degrees colder. It is also going to be fairly windy in parts, particularly along the east coast, where we have a weather warning. Combined with the drop in temperatures it will suddenly seem a lot colder.’

He added: ‘The weather was pretty decent in the past few days, with many parts of the country enjoying temperatures above 20C (68F). We’re well into autumn and the next few days will remind us of that.

Change: Temperatures were expected to plunge as low as freezing in parts of Scotland last night and today with 50mph winds in north-east England

Getting colder: Forecasters said a cold front will start moving south from Scotland, bringing rain and cooler temperatures to most of the country

‘After today, the temperatures will 
pick up slightly, but as well as windy conditions, there will be the 
risk of rain and showers in the south into the weekend.’

On Tuesday, some parts of Britain basked in 
above-average temperatures as high as 22C (72F). Today it will struggle 
to reach 11C (52F) in most parts.

The Environment Agency said:
 ‘Strong winds and large waves could cause minor disruption along the 
North Sea coast from Yorkshire to Essex.

'The high winds and localised 
flooding on roads could make driving conditions difficult in coastal 
areas.’

that help them change colour and develop their vibrant autumn hues.

Forecasters
