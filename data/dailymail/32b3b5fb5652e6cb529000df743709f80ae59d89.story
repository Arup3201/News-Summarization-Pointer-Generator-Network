Spectators at the Henley Regatta were taken aback to see a runaway capybara - the world's largest rodent - scampering along the river bank.

It had escaped from Lady Judy McAlpine, of the McAlpine construction empire's, animal sanctuary at Fawley Hill estate, in Buckinghamshire.

Onlooker Rachael Crockford, 22, a student from Cambridge, said: 'Everyone was saying 'what on earth is it?' It kicked up a massive fuss. There were loads of people across the bank looking at it.

'It looked like the size of a dog but clearly wasn't, it also looked like a beaver.'

The capybara, a south American cousin of the guinea pig, was recaptured last month after an earlier escape, but had made another bid for freedom.

It appeared along the Thames as crowds gathered for the five-day rowing event.

Lady McAlpine, whose husband helped found the McAlpine construction company, which has helped them become one of Britain's wealthiest families, said the male must be 'very lonely' as they are pack animals.

Riverbank: Onlookers say that it became an attraction at the Henley Regatta

Rachael said: 'It certainly was an attraction for Henley Regatta for a while. It was the fact that it appeared at one of the busiest events in Henley as another spectator just casually rocking up on the bank which was amusing.'

Rachael's boyfriend Benjamin Hunter, a rowing coach, captured a picture of the creature.Â 

Capybaras are the largest rodents on the planet, weighing from 35 to 66 kg and standing up to 0.6 metres at the shoulder, with a length of about 1.2 metres.

Earlier this year the McAlpine family appealed for help after a Brazilian aardvark, believed to have escaped from their sanctuary, was found dead in forests close to their home.

Lady McAlpine said the animal had escaped from the estate at Fawley Hill, Henley on Thames, several months ago.

She told the Daily Telegraph: 'We're assuming this one is our boy, which is sickeningly sad, as he was adorable.'

She called for the public to help find a second male Brazilian aardvark, or coati, which escaped at the same time.
