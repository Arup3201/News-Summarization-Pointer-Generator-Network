Nearly half of all the UK's prime time Twitter traffic is about what's happening on the television, says a new report from the social messaging web app.

Figures revealed in the the Tune In with Twitter report, published yesterday, show the service's 'strongly symbiotic' relationship with what remains the dominant medium for transmitting popular culture.

It claims that Twitter is increasingly acting as television viewers' 'second screen' of choice, with 60 per cent of users posting messages on the site while they are watching the box.

Good clean family fun: A new report from Twitter has analysed the tweeting habits of television viewers and found 40 per cent of all tweets sent during prime time are about TV broadcasts

'Twitter is the shortest distance between you and what interests you most,' the report said. 'This interest is expressed in a huge volume of conversation.

'Four hundred million Tweets are sent every day. As a result when events happen in the real world, they happen on Twitter.

'More and more we’re finding this is true for TV. When stand-out moments happen on TV, spikes in related conversation happen on Twitter.

'In fact, according to Second Sync, 40 per cent of all UK Twitter traffic at peak TV viewing time is about TV.'

Twitter's analysis also revealed how the Tweeting habits of television viewers vary depending on the kinds of programme they are watching.

It found that users were far more likely to send Tweets while they were watching factual or reality TV programmes, while they became comparatively quiet during dramas and films.

According to the report, there are more than 10million active Twitter users in the UK alone, with 60 per cent using the service while watching television.

Users' patterns of engagement while watching factual television programmes mirror key events or iconic moments during the broadcast, it said.

However, in drama, bursts of Tweets 'bookend' the beginning and the ends of episodes, as viewers settle down to watch the storyline unfold without interruption.

Reality TV 'entertainment' like Made in Chelsea have a high proportion of viewers tweeting their responses to the programmes, the report said, with as many as one in four viewers actively using Twitter while they watch.

Tweets peak at the beginning of the programme and, despite further, lesser peaks, tail off as it wears on.

Current affairs programmes like Panorama, on the other hand, have what the report describes as a 'long tail of engagement', with conversation on Twitter continuing long after the end of the broadcast.

They also see a higher proportion of Tweets sent from desktop computers, with peaks following climactic moments in the narrative or prompts from hashtags displayed on air.

Films on TV regularly trend on Twitter, according to the report, and have a unique, recurring profile with peaks following key moments in the story lines and quotes from the dialogue often tweeted widely.

One section of the report dealt exclusively with last year's X Factor series, which in its first show saw double the number of related tweets as were sent at the same stage of the previous year's competition.

'X Factor generated more than 14million Tweets in 2012, driven by integration of dynamic hashtags on air, celebrity Tweets, and a passionate Twitter audience,' the report said.

It also claimed that tweets had served as an accurate barometer for public opinion, with the eventual winner James Arthur mentioned more often than any other contestant from day one of the contest.

'In the final there were 1.12m Tweets from 505k unique users. There were 387k mentions for James, compared to 86k for the runner up Jahmene Douglas,' the report said.

The document was prepared for Twitter's corporate customers and contains a raft of recommendations to advertisers and marketers suggesting ways they can increase engagement among consumers.

'More brands are seeing Twitter as a second screen to TV. Conversations about content and advertising happen in real-time on Twitter, scaling reach quickly on Twitter’s open platform,' it concluded.

'Through the actions of discovery and engagement Twitter and TV drive each other in a virtuous cycle.

'Every programme and every ad has a Twitter presence. Integrating Twitter into creative and

campaigns will better promote visibility and engagement to target audiences.'
