There are a seemingly unlimited amount of conspiracy
theories as to what happened on the cool November morning in Dallas nearly 50
years ago.

The former girlfriend of Lee Harvey Oswald, the man who is
widely accepted as President John F. Kennedy’s killer, is adding to the list.

In a new explosive memoir, Judyth Vary Baker argues that
Oswald could not have murdered the 35th President of the United States in Dealy
Plaza.

Girlfriend: In her new book, Me and Lee, Judyth Vary Baker claims that Oswald was framed for the assassination of JFK

Revealed: Besides knowing Lee Harvey Oswald intimately, Vary Baker said she was working on a secret government project to give Fidel Castro lung cancer

‘Lee Oswald was a hero,’ Ms Baker began, speaking at an
Oregon bookstore earlier this week. ‘I’m here to tell you that when you find
out who did it, you will understand more about who took over our country and
why we are in the position we are in today,’ according to KVAL News.

The author, who lives abroad due to what she claims are safety concerns, is going
on a limited tour this month and onto December to promote her book ‘Me &
Lee: How I Came To Know, Love, And Lose Lee Harvey Oswald.’

She will also make several other appearances via Skype.

Ms Baker was a whiz-kid, carrying out complicated cancer
research in New Orleans in the early 1960s at the age of 19.

‘I was assigned to
make cancer more deadly,’ she told KVAL. ‘Can you imagine?’

She said that she met Oswald in 1963 during this internship
working under Dr Alton Ochsner, the former president of the American Cancer
Society and they became involved.

Tragic end: Jacqueline Kennedy rests her head on husband John F. Kennedy's shoulder, after his arrival into New York to campaign, three years before his assassination in Dallas

'I was his 
lover,' she remembered, while not elaborating on their trysts. 'I loved 
him and he loved me and I believe that with all my heart.'

Oswald, she explained, was also part of the Ochsner project.

According to her book, the cancer research helmed by Dr
Ochsner was tied to efforts to bring down Cuba’s then-president Fidel Castro
through biological means, injecting the guerrilla leader with a fast-spreading
cancer and making it nearly impossible to trace back to the U.S.

Oswald also told Ms Baker of the Kennedy assassination plot
from conversations they had up to two days before November 23, 1963.

In her 600-page book, Ms Baker argues that her
then-boyfriend was a deeply undercover intelligence agent who was actually
trying to prevent Kennedy from being killed.

She said that Oswald was framed
for the murder, which she said he could not have committed from his sniper post
at the Texas Book Depository.

Mystery: Oswald's girlfriend claims he was ordered to kill Kennedy but that he refused to go through with it

Assassinated: Lee Harvey Oswald was himself killer by Jack Ruby during a television press conference at Dallas police headquarters

She told KVAL: ‘We have a lot of information that Kennedy
was shot from the front,’ noting that the book depository was behind Kennedy’s
motorcade.

Ms Baker said that there was a conspiracy against Oswald
from the beginning. ‘They arrest him, they say he’s from Russia.’

Now approaching her golden years, Ms Baker said the last words she ever
heard Oswald say to her were on phone call when he ended with: ‘I love you, Judyth.’

That was two days before
Oswald himself was shot dead outside of Dallas’ police headquarters.

The assassination of President Kennedy has been the
springboard of countless conspiracies, including ones that there were multiple
gunmen, witnesses were intimidated, and that evidence had been both tampered
with and fabricated.

Next year marks the 50th anniversary of Kennedy's death.

Young love: Baker said Oswald confided in her about a plot to kill Kennedy as 'pillow talk' and says the last words he ever said to her were 'I love you'

Sworn: President Lyndon B. Johnson took the oath of office aboard Air Force One after the assassination of JFK with Jacqueline Kennedy at his side

Junior: JFK Jr. created an iconic image as he saluted his father's passing coffin

NOVEMBER 22, 1963

12.29 p.m. Central Standard Time: The presidential motorcade
turns onto Dealey Plaza in Dallas. The open-top limousine has a driver and
security guard in the front row, Texas governor John Connally and wife Nellie
Connally in the middle row, and President John F Kennedy and wife Jacqueline in
the back row.

12.30 p.m.: Witnesses testified that three shots were fired.
The famous video recording of the event filmed by onlooker Abraham Zapruder
shows that first Kennedy clutches his chest and seems to gasp before another
shot hits his head. Governor Connally is also hit.

Mrs Kennedy immediately begins climbing towards the back of
the vehicle, apparently in an effort to grab part of the President's skull,
which flew back after he was shot. The Connallys reported that Mrs Kennedy said
'I've got his brains in my hand!'

12.33 p.m.: Shooter Lee Harvey Oswald exits the Texas School
Book Depository, where he fired the shots from a sixth floor window.

12.38 p.m.: The presidential limo arrives at Parkland
Hospital.

1 p.m.: President Kennedy is pronounced dead. A Catholic
priest had been found and he performed his last rites. Doctors said that while
they tried extremely hard to save his life, the wounds were too great by the
time he arrived in the hospital. 'We never had any hope of saving his life,'
said Dr. Malcolm Perry.

1.15 p.m.: Oswald shoots and kills police officer J.D. Tippit
while he is on the run.

1.33 p.m.: White House press secretary Malcolm Kilduff entered
the area of the hospital where the press had gathered and made a brief
statement confirming the President's death, as caused by a gunshot wound to the
brain.

1.50 p.m.: Oswald is arrested inside the Texas Theater movie
house where he went in an effort to evade capture.

2.00 p.m.: President Kennedy's body was brought to Air Force
One.

2.38 p.m.: Lyndon Baines Johnson was sworn in as the country's
36th president on board Air Force One, standing next to Mrs Kennedy who
continued to wear the blood-stained pink skirt suit that she had on earlier.

3.01 p.m.: FBI director J. Edgar Hoover writes a memo saying
that the President's killer had been captured.

6 p.m.: Eastern Standard Time: The plane arrives at Andrews Air
Force Base in Washington. President Kennedy's casket and Mrs Kennedy leave
first before President Johnson makes a brief statement on the tarmac. 'This is
a sad time for all people....I will do my best; that is all I can do. I ask for
your help and God's,' he said.

7.05 p.m Central Standard Time.: Oswald is charged with the murder of Officer
Tippit.

11.26 p.m.: Oswald is charged with the murder of President
Kennedy.

Two days later, November 24, 1963

11:21 a.m.: Television cameras catch nightclub owner Jack Ruby
shoot Oswald in the basement of the Dallas Police headquarters.
