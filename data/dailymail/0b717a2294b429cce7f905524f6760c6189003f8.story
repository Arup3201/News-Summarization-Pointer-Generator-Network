Terror etched on her face, a woman clings desperately to the sheer rockface as waves crash around her feet.

Cut off by the incoming tide and left with no option but to try to scramble up the cliff, she screams for help to other holidaymakers on the beach.

Luckily her cries were heard by the  coastguard, who raised the alarm as the rising water threatened to engulf her.

Trapped: Frightened holidaymaker Stacey Hayes (circled) was caught out by the high Spring tide on Good Friday, and had to be winched to safety by a rescue helicopter

In danger: Miss Hayes could have died if she had fallen into the water, but was rescued after local Coastguard station manager Dave Jackson heard her cries and raised the alarm

The woman, Stacey Hayes, was winched 
to safety by a Royal Navy helicopter moments after three other tourists –
including her boyfriend Adam Neal – were rescued from the bay by a 
lifeboat.

The group, from Leyland, Lancashire, 
had been cut off by the tide between Green Bay and Porthcurno Beach in  
Cornwall on Good Friday.

Coastguard Dave Jackson said of the dramatic rescue:  'I could hear her screams so I called
Falmouth Coastguard and asked for a launch of [rescue helicopter] 193 
Culdrose immediately.

'She was screaming for help and was only about a foot off the water with waves breaking above her.

'From the minute Culdrose were called to when they got there, if she had fallen into the water it could have been very serious.'

The rescue involved Land's End Coastguard, Sennen Cove RNLI and a Sea King helicopter from RNAS Culdrose.

But the rescue was almost replicated the next day when four more holidaymakers were again caught out on the cliffs, just before 3pm.

Terror: Miss Hayes's hysterical screams could be heard hundreds of metres away as she clung to the cliff by her fingernails, with waves crashing over her head

Edward and Sally Hater, from Brighton and Oxford respectively, and Zoe Vince, from London, were all winched to safety by the Culdrose helicopter after becoming trapped by the incoming tide.

Mr and Mrs Hater had become stuck on the same section of cliff as Stacey Hayes the day before and were joined by coastguard station manager Mr Jackson as they waited for help.

The fourth holidaymaker, Londoner Rosie Parsons, had slipped and fallen into the sea but scrambled to Green Bay for safety.

She was rescued by the RNLI and taken to Porthcurno Beach where the other three were recovering.

Rosie Parsons and Zoe Vince were later taken to Royal Cornwall Hospital as both were suffering symptoms of hypothermia.

The incidents came as the coast was battered by Spring tides, which are some of the strongest of the year.

Not technically linked to the season, Spring tides occur when the Earth, Sun and Moon are all in a line.    

Mr Jackson added: 'People were not aware of the state of the tides and clearly did not realise how quickly it comes in and cuts off exits.

'These incidents could have had a fatal outcome if it was not for the rapid response of the emergency services.

'People need to be aware of the state of the tides at all times, especially if there are no lifeguards on duty.'

These were just some of a number of incidents across Cornwall attended by emergency services over the weekend.

In the most serious, 60-year-old Peter Sleeman lost his life while attempting to rescue his 27-year-old son, Paul, who was later saved by Port Isaac RNLI, after he was swept off rocks at Tregardock, near Delabole, on Sunday.
