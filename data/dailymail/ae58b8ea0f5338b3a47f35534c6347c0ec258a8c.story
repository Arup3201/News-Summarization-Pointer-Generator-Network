Three Chinese naval ships have docked at a British base for a formal visit that samples the strength of the fleet being built up by the country.

Chinese ambassador Liu Xiaoming and hundreds of flag-waving UK-based Chinese residents welcomed the ships into Portsmouth Naval Base.

Heading a task group on enhancing military understanding between the two countries is the assault ship Chang Bai Shan.

She was accompanied by the frigate Yun Cheng and the replenishment ship Chaohu at the Hampshire dockyard.

During the five-day visit, senior officers from both navies will discuss maritime topics including counter-piracy operations across the Indian Ocean.

The visit comes seven months after a report from the US Pentagon which examined how China was growing the size and reach of its naval fleet.

And that followed revelations that China was increasing its military budget by 12 per cent to more than £86billion - compared to £33billion in the UK.

China now spends three times as much as India on defence - and more than neighbouring Japan, Vietnam, Taiwan and South Korea put together.

Task group commander Rear Admiral Zhang Chuansha said: ‘Our visit to the UK is a good opportunity to enhance our understanding of each other.

‘It’s a great opportunity for our sailors to get exposure to local people and our counterparts in the British Navy.

‘All sailors share something in common. We share the same sea, the same international obligations such as dealing with piracy.'

The Mail reported in October 2013 how the Royal Navy had 15 times more commanding officers than active warships, with 40 admirals and 260 captains but just 19 ships.

To make £4.7billion savings and help eliminate a £38billion deficit in the equipment programme, the Navy was cutting its force by 5,000 sailors and four warships.

Last June, former first sea lord Lord West of Spithead said naval fleet cuts had gone too far and were a 'national disgrace'. But the Ministry of Defence insisted 'tough decisions had to be taken to deal with the budget deficit'.

Four years ago, the Mail revealed that the Army had more top brass than battle tanks. 

Ambassador Liu Xiaoming said: ‘This visit gives a flavour of the partnership between China and the UK.

‘It is also good for the British public to understand the Chinese military and what it is able to do. It has been seven years since our last visit.

‘The world has changed and so has the reach of the Chinese navy. 

'We’ve carried out 48 missions in the Gulf region in that time and helped to protect 6,000 vessels.

‘So we have a lot to talk about - there is a lot for the two navies to share. 

'And this visit will go a long way to strengthening our relationship.’

Commodore Jeremy Rigby, naval base commander, said: ‘We welcome our Chinese visitors to the operational home of the Royal Navy.

‘As with our ship visits abroad, these events are not only of great diplomatic significance, but also very useful militarily given that we share similar global challenges including counter-piracy, preventing conflict, protecting our citizens overseas and supporting UN peacekeeping efforts.

‘China, like us, relies on trade at sea for its prosperity and we work together around the world.

‘The visit to Portsmouth is a really good way for us to talk, navy to navy, with like-minded sailors, sharing information on our operations.’

Waving the flags: Crew members from the vessels will be given tours of attractions including HMS Victory, HMS Warrior and the Mary Rose

Crew members from all three vessels will be given tours of local attractions including HMS Victory, HMS Warrior and the Mary Rose.

They will also be shown around the Royal Navy’s newest warship, Type 45 destroyer HMS Duncan.

The two nations will also compete in badminton and basketball matches at HMS Temeraire in Portsmouth - the Navy’s home of physical training.

The ships’ last port of call was Salalah in Oman and they will leave Portsmouth this Friday to head for Kiel in Germany.
