Doctors began a C-section on a girl of 16 even though she was not pregnant, according to reports.

The unnamed teenager went under the knife when staff at New York Downtown Hospital in Manhattan did not spend enough time checking to see if she was expecting.

The procedure, which took place in 2007, appears to have been halted soon after it began - but five years on the patient still does not know the truth.

Claims: The story emerged in an unfair dismissal hearing by Dr Suarna Mehulic who says she was fired from a hospital for exposing dangerous practices

A hospital spokesman has vehemently denied that the bungled procedure took place and has called such claims ‘egregious and inflammatory'

The story emerged in an unfair dismissal hearing brought by Dr Suarna Mehulic who says she was fired from the hospital for exposing dangerous practices at its Obstetrics and Gynecological department.

It was first reported by NBC New York.

During depositions Dr Mehulic's former colleague Dr Lana Boter was asked by one of the plaintiff’s lawyers: ‘Was there an occasion when a C-section was performed on a patient at the hospital who was not pregnant?

Dr Boter replied: ‘There was.

‘A little extra time would have shown that there was no pregnancy at all.’

She added that she was not directly involved in the patient’s care but was on the hospital’s Quality Assurance Committee which oversees standards.

Dr Mehulic’s lawyers asked another medic, Dr Anca Rosa: ‘Was there a C-section on a patient who was not pregnant?’

Dr Rosa replied: ‘Yes. Turns out she wasn’t pregnant.’

She added that ‘nobody cut into the uterus to do a C-section’ but that some surgery did take place.

Dr Rosa also explained that she performed a sonogram on the patient but midway through handed over to an attending physician and left the room before any surgery was started.

Dr Mehulic first became aware of the case a few weeks later when she treated the patient for pain in her pelvis.

It quickly became apparent that the patient was still under the impression that she had been pregnant.

'When I saw her I knew that she could not have been pregnant. I did not tell her, nobody appears to have told her. She will be 20 now and has the right to know'

In an interview with MailOnline Dr Mehulic said that as far as she knew, even now the patient was unaware.

She said: ‘When I saw her I knew that she could not have been pregnant.

‘I did not tell her, nobody appears to have told her. She will be 20 now and has the right to know.’

Asked how this happened in the first place, she said: ‘Nobody did a pregnancy test. I’m not sure’.

Interview: Dr Lana Boter said she was giving evidence and 'I told the truth about this C-section but I had nothing to do with the rest of the case'

Speaking to MailOnline Dr Boter said: ‘I was giving evidence and I told the truth about this C-section but I had nothing to do with the rest of the case.’

She also confirmed she was on the hospital’s Quality Assurance Committee at the time the incident happened.

'No C-section has ever been performed in our hospital on a woman who was not pregnant'

Hospital spokesman

Nobody from the hospital was available to comment for MailOnline.

According to NBC New York, executives claimed Dr Mehulic was a paranoid and overall not a good doctor and that she was fired for insubordination.

A hospital spokesman told its reporter Chris Glorioso : ‘No C-section has ever been performed in our hospital on a woman who was not pregnant, and if you were to suggest otherwise it would be an egregious and inflammatory error.’

It is not clear how the girl came to be confused about her pregnancy as full details about her case have not been released by the hospital.
