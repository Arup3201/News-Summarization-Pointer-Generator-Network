A German construction company has come under fire after fitting a supposedly random set of bricks in the shape of a swastika in a public walkway.

Their mistake was swiftly spotted by shoppers in the town of Goslar, northwest Germany, who called the police.

Any use of Nazi symbols is illegal in Germany, and police were called to the scene, but the builders claim the shape of the bricks was an accident.

Shoppers in Goslar, Lower Saxony called police after spotting the swastika in the newly fitted walkway, but builders claim it was an accident

The new pathway had just been officially unveiled in the pedestrian zone of one of the main shopping streets in Goslar, Lower Saxony.

Police confirmed that there was indeed a swastika in the middle of the newly laid walkway, but said they could not determine that it had been done deliberately.

City Council officials however said that deliberate or not, they ordered it covered and got the builders back in to rearrange the brickwork and eradicate the Nazi symbol.

A spokesman for the city council Christian Burgart said: ‘We do not tolerate such behaviour here.

'It is inexcusable, therefore we ordered it to be removed straight away.’

He added: ‘This symbol has nothing to do with our town and has no place whatsoever here.’

A police spokesman said: ‘We have no leads, we are keeping our options open and investigating.

’We are speaking to the building firm responsible for the new footpath. They claim it was not deliberate but just an innocent mistake, and have already changed it.’

German law prohibits ‘use of symbols of unconstitutional organisations,’ encompassing all Nazi symbolism and, as a result, the swastika.

The German Strafgesetzbuch (Criminal Code) section 86a bans any form of display of a swastika, even if used in ‘innocent’ situations.
