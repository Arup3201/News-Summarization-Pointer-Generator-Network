Sheffield United took what their fans may view as a small measure of revenge over West Ham last night.

Victory at Upton Park came in a penalty shootout after the Hammers’ £12million signing Enner Valencia, the Ecuador World Cup striker, had his spot-kick saved on his home debut.

Moments later, Sheffield United’s players were running half the length of the pitch to celebrate with their fans after Michael Doyle wrong-footed Jussi Jaaskelainen to win it 5-4

Upton Park was almost full for this second round tie, the first meeting between the clubs since they fell out spectacularly over a Carlos Tevez transfer. West Ham paid compensation in the region of £20m to Sheffield United after Tevez’s last-day winner away to champions Manchester United in 2006-07 effectively relegated the south Yorkshire club. But there were irregularities over Tevez’s signing and the club were aggrieved that West Ham were not punished more stringently.

That money - and subsequent parachute payments for falling out of the Premier League - was not put to good use and Sheffield United are spending a fourth successive season in the third tier of English football. But Tuesday night’s result was sweet for them.

Manager Nigel Clough said: ‘There’s still a little a bit of injustice felt by our fans but hopefully this was about how we played, and the win tonight.’

Both he and opposite number Sam Allardyce praised Blades goalkeeper Mark Howard, who made a series of superb saves to take the tie to penalties.

‘At the end of the day it is our fault,’ said Allardyce. ‘It was an Inspired performance by their goalkeeper. Whatever we shot at him he saved or blocked and if he saved, it fell to one of their boys.’ 

Only three players from that 2006-07 season - Mark Noble, James Collins and Carlton Cole - remain at Upton Park and only Noble was included in Tuesday night’s squad. But the passage of time and personnel has not served to stem the flow of bad feeling.

Laces had barely been fastened before the first shouts of ‘There’s only one Carlos Tevez’ rang out from the home support. Around 900 visiting fans travelled and from their corner of the Sir Trevor Brooking Stand they responded with catty calls of ‘same old West Ham, always cheating’.

Allardyce handed a season debut to the boundlessly talented but seemingly endlessly troubled Ravel Morrison, just two days before he is due to appear for a preliminary hearing at Manchester Crown Court. The 21-year-old has been charged with two counts of common assault.

Morrison, wearing the trademark black gloves he dons whatever the weather, from high summer to midwinter, played his part in their goal. His pass out wide was collected by Reece Burke and whipped into the box to Diafra Sakho, who headed into the bottom corner. It was a debut goal for the Senegalese striker signed from Metz for £3.5m.

Sheffield United were fortunate to equalise 12 minutes into the second half through a Winston Reid own goal. The West Ham captain was in the wrong place at the wrong time when Bob Harris’s cross was missed by Marc McNulty and deflected off Reid past Jaaskelainen.
