The Queen’s visit to Italy planned for later this week is in doubt after she cancelled a public engagement yesterday because of illness.

She had been due to attend  St David’s Day celebrations in Wales, but pulled out after being diagnosed with gastroenteritis.

The Queen, who is 86, and the Duke of Edinburgh are scheduled  to visit Rome from Wednesday  to Thursday.

Strong: Her Majesty has always refused to fuss over a string of ailments over recent years

A Buckingham Palace spokesman said the trip was still due to take place, but a final decision would be made after the Queen was assessed by doctors.

A spokeswoman earlier confirmed that the Queen was spending the weekend resting at Windsor after being laid low with the stomach bug.

The monarch was due to attend a military celebration in Swansea on Friday as part  of the city’s St David’s Day celebrations.

The Queen, 86, was due to spend three hours a meeting soldiers and their families before a lunch at the George Hall.

She had also planned to present St David’s Day leeks to members of 3rd Battalion The Royal Welsh Regiment.

The ceremony continued in her absence, but was carried out by the Lord Lieutenant of West Glamorgan, Byron Lewis.

The Queen has rarely taken time off due to illness during her six decades as monarch.

She is normally in robust health and is known not to make a fuss in times of sickness or discomfort.

She has, however, suffered occasional problems with her back. In October, she was forced to cancel an appearance at a Windsor Castle investiture ceremony, and also had to miss a church service in Scotland a few days earlier.

Host: The Queen was well enough to award Jessica Ennis a CBE and Nicola Adams an MBE at the Investiture ceremony on Thursday, but has since taken a turn for the worse

In 2006, she suffered a strain to her 
back during her annual summer break at Balmoral which led to her 
cancelling a tour of Arsenal’s new stadium.

She also missed a visit to the British Museum in October 2011 because of a bad cold.

Disappointed locals took to Twitter to voice their upset at the change of plans for Swansea. Becca 
Masters commented ‘poor Queenie’ while Peter Grant added ‘Get well soon 
your Majesty!’

June Marcroft added: ‘Jeez, she’s human after all, I thought she was bionic.’

Honoured: Olympic cycling coach David Brailsford received a Knighthood at The Queen's Investiture ceremony

Leaders: Although the Queen has suffered various illness and injury in recent years, it is the health of Prince Philip that is more often in the spotlight

The Queen’s most recent appearance was
to present a host of Olympic stars with honours during an investiture 
ceremony at Buckingham Palace on Thursday.

Gastroenteritis is an infection of the stomach and bowel, with common symptoms including vomiting, diarrhoea and dehydration.

In England, the two most common causes
of gastroenteritis in adults are the norovirus and food poisoning, 
according to NHS Choices.

In June, the Duke of Edinburgh 
succumbed to a bladder infection thought to be brought on after being 
forced to stand for several hours in cold, wet and windy conditions on a
barge sailing down the Thames during the Jubilee River Pageant.

The 91-year-old was taken into 
hospital just hours  before the Queen’s Diamond Jubilee’s closing 
celebrations at Buckingham Palace,  where she was joined by some 12,000 
people.

The illness forced him to miss several other key events, including a service of thanksgiving at St Paul’s Cathedral.

Gastroenteritis is an infection of the stomach and bowel and is very common in England, with about one in five people affected every year.

The two most common causes in adults are a virus, such as the norovirus, or food poisoning, according to NHS Choices.

The infection interferes with one of the main functions of the intestines, the absorption of water from the contents of the intestines into the body.

Common symptoms of gastroenteritis include vomiting, diarrhoea and dehydration. Most types of gastroenteritis are highly infectious, and bacteria can be transferred through poor hygiene, such as not washing your hands after going to the toilet.

Viruses and bacteria on hands can be transferred to whatever they touch, such as a glass, kitchen utensil or food. Most people with gastroenteritis only have mild symptoms and the infection passes after a few days without the need for treatment.

But sufferers may need treatment in hospital if symptoms are severe or if they are vulnerable because of their age or another illness. This is because diarrhoea can quickly cause dehydration which, if severe, can be fatal.

Each year in England and Wales, an average 190 deaths occur because of gastroenteritis. Most deaths are in people over 65.
