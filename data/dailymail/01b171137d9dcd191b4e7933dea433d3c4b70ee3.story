Another Bush may be running for president.

Former Florida Governor Jeb Bush left the door open to running when asked this week if he was considering a 2016 bid on the Republican ticket.

‘The decision will be based on, can I do it joyfully, because I think we need to have candidates lift our spirits,’ he told local media gathered Wednesday during an appearance at a suburban Miami school, according to WFOR.

Will he or won't he?: Former Florida Governor Jeb Bush was non-committal about whether or not he would run in 2016 during a school visit this week

Jeb Bush is the son of 41st President George H.W. Bush and brother of 43rd President George W. Bush – family matriarch Barbara Bush said last year when asked about a potential run by son Jeb that ‘we've had enough Bushes.’

Those remarks and a surge in popularity by New Jersey Republican Governor Chris Christie led many to believe Jeb Bush wasn’t eying a run at the Oval Office. But the last there months have changed things.

Mr Christie’s popularity has begun to fall as he endures multiple scandals related to lane closures on the George Washington Bridge and tying Superstorm Sandy aid owed to Hoboken to the approval of real estate projects.

With no clear frontrunner, Jeb Bush might have a clear path to at least the Republican nomination were he to run.

'Can I do it joyfully?': Jeb Bush says that unless he can uplift the spirits of the voters, he will not run

‘I’m going to think about it (running for president) later,’ said Jeb Bush. ‘I don’t wake up each day saying, ‘what am I going to do today to make this decision?

‘I’m deferring the decision to the right time which is later this year and the decision will be based on, can I do it joyfully, because I think we need to have candidates lift our spirits,’ he continued.

‘It’s a pretty pessimistic country right now; and, is it right for my family? So I don’t even want to think about that till it’s the right time and that’s later on,’ he added.

Other potential candidates whose names have been floated round include Kentucky Senator Rand Paul and fellow Floridian Marco Rubio.

'I love her': The youngest Bush son said he loves mother Barbara Bush despite her saying she hopes he doesn't run for president

Former first lady Barbara Bush said, despite her reservations, that ‘Jeb is the best qualified person to run.’

When asked about his mother’s remarks about another presidential run by the family, Jeb Bush replied that ‘she is 89 years old and if you have elderly parents or grandparents, you know they speak their mind. 

‘There is not much stopping between thinking and speaking,’ he continued. ‘I love her.’
