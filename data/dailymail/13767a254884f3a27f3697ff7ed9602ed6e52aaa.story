Murdered: Fusilier Lee Rigby was hacked to death on May 22 in Woolwich, south-east London

A 21-year-old woman has been charged with terror offences over video clips about the murder of soldier Lee Rigby.

Rebekah Dawson, of Hackney, east London, is accused of dissemination of terrorist publications and encouragement of terrorism, and will appear at Westminster Magistrates' Court tomorrow.

She is jointly charged along with Royal Barnes, 22, also from Hackney, who appeared at the same court yesterday to face terror charges linked to the footage.

Dawson is accused of making two video recordings on May 22, the day of Fusilier Rigby's murder in Woolwich, south-east London.

She then allegedly distributed them with the intention of encouraging others in the commission, preparation or instigation of an act of terrorism.

Dawson is also accused of encouraging terrorism by publishing a statement with Barnes entitled ‘Muslim laughs at British Soldier killing’. Barnes is due to appear at the Old Bailey on Friday.

Laws passed after the 2005 London bombings ban anything that ‘glorifies the commission or preparation’ of terrorist acts, a crime punishable by up to seven years in prison, a fine, or both.

Consumer relations worker Barnes, who wore a blue and white striped T-shirt to court for his hearing yesterday, was flanked by two guards in the dock, speaking only to confirm his name and address.

Michael Adebolajo, 28, and Michael Adebowale, 22, are charged with Fusilier Rigby's murder.

The charges come after Prince Charles spoke of his sorrow at the 'brutal' execution and admitted it has affected the morale of the armed forces, but proved their ability to overcome adversity.

Fusilier Rigby, 25, a father-of-one and from the 2nd Battalion Royal Regiment of Fusiliers, was run down by a car and then hacked to death as he returned to his barracks.

The Prince of Wales said he was shocked by the act, and said he understood the worry of families whose loved-ones are in the forces, as his son Harry has actively served around the world.

'The challenges our Armed Forces face are not confined to physical and psychological injuries sustained on the battlefield,' he said, writing in The Sun.
