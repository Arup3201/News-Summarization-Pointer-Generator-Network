A teenager who wanted to help grieving relatives cope with the loss of loved ones has become one of the youngest funeral directors in Britain.

Amy Darlow, 19, from Salisbury, began working with the dead when she was just 14 during a work experience placement.

She'd applied for it after seeing her grandmother's body as a child, an experience that made her want to make the experience less traumatic for relatives.

Miss Darlow says her friends were surprised by her choice of career but she enjoys the work

Miss Darlow, whose boyfriend and childhood sweetheart Declan Spreadbury, 22, is untroubled by her job, says the first dead body she saw was her grandmother's when she was 10.

She said: 'People try to hide death from children, but I was exposed to it - I went to see her in the Chapel of Rest.

'I was encouraged to kiss her on the 
forehead and say goodbye but sadly she wasn’t looking her best.

'I asked 
why there were bubbles coming out of her mouth and the reply was that 
she’d just come out of the fridge. I was just a child - but the image 
has stayed with me.'

Now Miss Darlow says she knows that the gastric air 
coming from her grandmother’s mouth could have been prevented by embalming 
the body in a certain way.

She said: 'She could have looked 
better. It’s important to get it right - because that’s the last time 
you’ll see someone. I want people to go away with good lasting 
memories.'

Miss Darlow has been working for funeral directors Will Case and Partners in Salisbury for over a year

Miss Darlow's boyfriend and childhood sweetheart Declan Spreadbury, 22, is quite used to her unusual job

'At the end of the day, we’re dealing with someone’s loved one. It’s not just a body.'

A year ago, Miss Darlow began working full-time at Will Case and Partners funeral directors in Salisbury.

One of the country's youngest undertakers, she said her career choice surprised some.

'My friends were surprised and asked all sorts of silly questions,' she said.

'They asked me if the bodies sat up 
when they were being cremated.  I told them that was just the 
gas coming out of the organs.'

Another nail in the coffin: Miss Darlow is studying for a degree in funeral services as well as working full-time

When she is not conducting funerals, Miss Darlow reads crime fiction and chats to her mother Elizabeth, 53

It prompted her to take up a full-time post at Will Case and Partners funeral directors in Salisbury a year ago - becoming one of the youngest undertakers.

Now she is completing a training course at the parlour, alongside a funeral services foundation degree and an embalming course at the University of Bath.

Clad in top hat, cravat and tail coats, Miss Darlow conducted her first funeral in June last year and has completed another nine since then.
