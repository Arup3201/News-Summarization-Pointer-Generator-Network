Prankster: Sean Martin was caught on video jumping up and down on a bus shelter when he was drunk

A drunken prankster who was filmed falling through a bus stop roof with his trousers down has been caught and hauled into court - after he became a YouTube hit.

Sean Martin, 26, from Stockport, was so drunk he decided to scale the ten foot high 
shelter, clambered onto the perspex top then pulled down his trousers to
bare his bottom at pals.

After bouncing up and down on the shelter he crashed through the perspex, landing on the ground.

As his friends looked on laughing and joking, Martin was seen landing on
his bottom before momentarily lying on the floor in a daze then getting
to his feet and staggering off.

At the time his high jinx was being filmed on a mobile phone and the 47 second clip was later uploaded to You Tube.

It was named 'Epic Fail!!!Idiot vs Bus Stop', and became became a massive hit on the video sharing website

Police were called in after a tip off about the footage and the incident
which caused £560 worth of damage to the bus shelter in Wilmslow, 
Cheshire.

A local beat bobby watched the footage is thought to have recognised 
Martin and tracked him down to his home in nearby Bramhall.

The video sparked hundreds of comments on the website and has had more than 185,000 views.

Zara Butt posted: 'This is hilarious.. but this kind of mischief didn’t come cheap. LOL.'

Widerthanone added: 'This is CLASS!!! Brilliant!! Too many youngsters these days spend their evenings at home, studying, or they’re out at Bible group or something. This is proper crack.'

BlaiddDrwg2009 said: 'I would love to see Part 2 of this video: their explanation to the paramedics.'

His defence team told Macclesfield Magistrates Court it was a miracle he was not injured during the stunt.

The video was first posted on YouTube in June last year. It shows the defendant on Green Lane in Wilmslow in the early hours of the morning being egged on by mates to climb onto a nearby bus stop and drop his trousers. He then collapses through the plastic roof and rolls onto the floor.

Debbie Byrne, prosecuting, told the court Cheshire Police were told about the online stunt, and he was tracked down.

Crash: He lands on the concrete ground hard and rolls around in pain

John
Gallagher, defending, told the court his client was drunk at the time, 
and added: 'This is very much reckless rather than intentional damage. I
doubt anyone would jump on a bus shelter roof hoping to go through it.

'It’s a miracle he wasn’t injured, frankly.'

Magistrates heard how the defendant remembered little of the incident.

He has an online retail business and now plans to emigrate to Australia with his family, the court heard.

Martin, of Bramhall Lane South, Bramhall, admitted criminal damage. 

He was fined £250 and ordered to pay £80 costs and £560 compensation to Cheshire East Council.
