A 15-year-old girl has revealed how Islamic State fighters killed her brother and sold her as a sex slave to three men.

Samiye is one of hundreds of women who were kidnapped by extremists from a Yazidi community on Iraq's Mount Sinjar last August.

The jihadists blocked Sinjar's roads with pick-up trucks and trafficked the women and girls to ISIS strongholds, where many of them are still being held. Men and boys over 14 were lined up on the ground and executed, survivors said.

Samiye (above), 15, has revealed how Islamic State fighters killed her brother and sold her as a sex slave to three men

Samiye was lucky enough to escape and is recovering at the Khanke refugee camp in Iraq.

She said she was raped in Fallujah, 42 miles west of Baghdad, while trying to flee from a village.

Her story is not uncommon. Women and girls, some as young as five, are regularly raped and abused, survivors said.

Bahar, 27, was captured by militants while she was trying to flee her home. She was raped twice - once in Mosul and the second time in Syria when she was caught escaping.

Another survivor Hawain was held prisoner for a month and a half before she escaped from captivity. The 14-year-old cannot bear to recount what happened.

Fahima, 33, and 13-year-old Dina were also taken. The victims said the militants deprived them of food, water and a place to sit.

ISIS consider the Yazidi sect to be devil worshippers and, unlike Christianity and Judaism, the religion is not acknowledged in the Koran.

The majority of the Yazidi community have been made homeless by ISIS, with hundreds massacred and thousands in captivity.

The Khanke refugee camp has become the home of more than 1,000 Yazidi and Iraqi families - close to 4,000 people.

Families at the camp are still desperately searching for missing people in the hope they are still alive.

Other Yazidi kidnapping victims, who do not wish to be identified, said the militants deprived them of food, water and even a place to sit

A picture has been drawn by a Yazidi artist depicting a brutal scene of slavery, torture and rape.

The drawing, which looks like it could have come out of the Dark Ages, illustrates ISIS militants holding men and women captive.

Some men have their hands chained around their necks while others  are killed by militants with long knives.

Semi-naked women are clutched by groups of men. Some are forced to the floor while others are pushed between large groups.

In the background of the picture, which was posted on Twitter, a cage can be seen filled with hooded victims while hundreds of captives stand outside in lines.

An Islamic State group flag flutters in the background.

Hayat, 38, clutches a picture of her two daughters Wahid, 18, and Riwaz, 14. They were captured by ISIS militants while trying to flee Sinjar, she explains. She does not know where they are or if they are alive.

Sabri, 45, is missing fourteen members of his family. His mother and father, three sister-in-laws, two nieces, four brothers and two cousins were all captured by  militants during a raid last year.

Kamal, 24, and Khaer, 22, are missing thirty family members.

Many of the survivors only have a few possessions left to remind them of those missing.

The survivors’ stories come as United Nations investigators found evidence ISIS are committing genocide against the Yazidi minority in Iraq.

The survivors’ stories come as United Nations investigators found evidence ISIS are committing genocide against the Yazidi minority in Iraq

The human rights office published a horrifying report yesterday describing killings, torture, rape, sexual slavery and the use of child soldiers by the extremists, suggesting they may be guilty of 'war crimes, crimes against humanity and genocide'. 

ISIS, which controls a swathe of territory in Iraq and neighbouring Syria, launched a series of systematic and widespread attacks on the Yazidi minority's heartland in the northern Nineveh province last August.

Kurdish peshmerga forces drove back Islamic State militants in north-western Iraq last month, breaking a long siege - but many Yazidi villages remain under ISIS control. 

The survivors' stories come as United Nations (UN) investigators found evidence ISIS are committing genocide against the Yazidi minority in Iraq.

The human rights office published a horrifying report yesterday describing killings, torture, rape, sexual slavery and the use of child soldiers by the extremists. 

It suggested they may be guilty of 'war crimes, crimes against humanity and genocide'.

The report, based on interviews with more than 100 witnesses and survivors between June 2014 and February 2015, highlights brutal ISIS attacks on the Yazidis. 

The jihadists consistently separated out men and boys over the age of 14 to be executed, according to investigators.

Younger boys were forced to become child soldiers and women and girls were abducted as the 'spoils of war'.

Head of the investigation Suki Nagra said: 'These attacks were aimed at destroying the Yazidi as a group.'

She added that ISIS was guilty of 'genocide' against the minority.

The report, which was ordered by the UN Human Rights Council last September following a request from the Iraqi government, pointed out that some villages 'were entirely emptied of their Yazidi population'. 

Boys as young as eight were forced to convert to Islam and given religious and military training, including being forced to watch videos of beheadings, the report said. 

The UN has now made calls for the perpetrators to be brought to justice at the International Criminal Court.
