A father whose eye-popping act became a YouTube sensation failed to set a new world record - because his eyes came out too far.

John Doyle, 30, became an instant online hit when he first started posting videos of his stunt two years ago.

One, set to Daft Punk's Get Lucky, reached 500,000 views within days.

He has since been flown everywhere from America to Japan to display his talent on TV.

Denied: John Doyle from Rainhill, Liverpool, was refused the title after being measured last night

The optometrists visiting him at Vincent Hotel in Southport didn't bring long-enough equipment

When the moment came to officiate his talent last night, the two professional optometrists brought the longest equipment they could - but it was not enough.

Only manned with a 12mm-long piece of apparatus, they were forced to deny him the title.

It is believed Mr Doyle, from Rainhill in Liverpool, hit 14mm.

Lamenting the blunder at the city's Vincent Hotel with his mum Jane, wife Becci, and two-year-old daughter Ruth, Mr Doyle - known as Mr Zoom - said he is determined to keep going:

'I started doing it just for fun, but then people said I could get something out of this.

'I’m disappointed not to have taken the record tonight, but it’s encouraging that it was off the scale. I’ll try again.'

It is the second blow for the newly-wed internet marketing worker, who believes he unofficially made history in Japan.

The father-of-one is determined to keep trying. He has trained for two years and performed worldwide

He said: 'Guinness World Records have quite strict criteria so it is tough to meet their standards.

'While in Japan, I believe I beat the world record for how far eyes can come out but due to the language barrier it was hard to get it recorded accurately.'

The father-of-one, who works in internet marketing, said the skill came to him about two years ago in the Coach and Horses pub near his home.

YouTube hit: Mr Doyle can swivel his eyes around. He performed his talents in a pub before taking to the internet

Determined: Mr Doyle will fight to get bigger equipment made so he can be crowned world's biggest eye popper

He added: 'I was doing it for friends in the pub and just put it on YouTube one day.

'I found I was getting emails from lots of different people commenting on it.

'Suddenly it had had a hundred views, then the figure kept going up and up and I was getting dozens of emails every couple of hours.'

He plans to attempt to break the record within weeks, once a machine capable to recording greater eye-popping distances is located.
