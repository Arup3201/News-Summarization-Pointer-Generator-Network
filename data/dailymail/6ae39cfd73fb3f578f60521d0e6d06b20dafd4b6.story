What an organ-isation: A British family has set a record for kidney transplants

A family with 11 members who have each received a donor kidney has set a UK transplant record.

All of them suffer a genetic condition called Polycystic Kidney Disease (PKD).

Briggetta Greenaway, 55, who joined her brother, two uncles, three aunts and four cousins in the transplant club, said: ‘We are  a unique family.’

Her uncle Bill Smith was the first family member to receive a transplant in 1963 in one of the UK’s first kidney transplants.

He died four months later of organ rejection, but four of his siblings had successful transplants between 1986 and 1998.

The disease is now into the third generation of the family, with  five of Briggetta’s nephews  likely to need a transplant in the near future.

Briggetta, a care worker from Chesterfield, who received her transplant in 1999, said: ‘We have all said thank you for this gift of life by keeping ourselves fit and healthy.’

She has traced the disease back to her grandfather Will Smith, who died aged 50. All of his eight children had PKD.

Briggetta’s brother Barry Greenaway, a road transport manager from Redhill in Surrey, said: ‘It’s amazing that so many  of us have had transplants, and almost all of them have gone well.

‘Without my transplant, I wouldn’t be working in the demanding job I now have. Getting a new kidney and coming off dialysis transformed my life.’

PKD is believed to affect about 60,000 people in the UK. Sufferers have a 50 per cent chance of passing on the defective gene to their children, and around half will need a transplant. The family’s story is testimony to how many lives have been saved by NHS transplant surgery.

‘Having half a dozen family members with a transplant  would be something, but 11 is staggering,’ said a spokesman for UK Transplant.

Symptoms of PKD include high blood pressure, faulty heart valves, problems urinating and enlarged kidneys. Over time, cysts cause kidney failure.
