A retired soldier who sued Burger King after he found two needles in his sandwich has reached an out of court settlement with the fast food chain.

Clark Bartholomew, a retired Army sergeant, claimed one needle pierced his tongue after biting into a Triple Stacker and the other lodged in his small intestine, requiring hospital treatment.

Despite the settlement a trial is still set to go ahead against the U.S. Army and Air Force Exchange, which operates the franchise on Schofield Barracks, Honolulu, where the burger was bought in 2010.

The exact terms of the settlement reached this week were confidential, but Bartholomew's lawyer, Paul Saccoccio, said it involves releasing Burger King Corp, and the food service company that provided the meat, from the lawsuit.

'We're confident in our case against the Burger King at Schofield,' Saccoccio said.

'We're just trying to focus the issues and we move forward. We did it for judicial economy.'

There have been several settlement attempts since the lawsuit was filed. 

When Bartholomew failed to attend one of the settlement conferences, a judge ordered him to pay nearly $8,500 in sanctions.

Government attorneys have said previously that the case should be dismissed because Bartholomew was injured during the course of his military service.

A judge refused to throw out the case.

Attorneys representing the defendants didn't immediately respond to requests for comment.

Bartholomew now lives in Chantilly, Virginia. He and his family will have to return to Hawaii for the trial in federal court in Honolulu.

A witness list filed by his attorneys indicates doctors and other medical professionals who treated Bartholomew are expected to testify.

Bartholomew is expected to testify about what he suffered, including the nine days it took for one needle to move through his body.
