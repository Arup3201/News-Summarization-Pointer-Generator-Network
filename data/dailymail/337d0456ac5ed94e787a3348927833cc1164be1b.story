Appalling new video has been released in Denver, Colorado, showing police officers throwing an inmate into his cell, where he was then choked and tased by a swarm of officers.

The video, unsealed on Friday by a judge in U.S. District Court as part of an order releasing other documents in an internal investigation into the conduct of the Denver Sheriff Department, shows an officer throwing inmate Jamal Hunter into a cell, where he then held down and choked with another officer joining in.

A third officer then enters the cell in the July 31, 2011 incident, and begins shocking Hunter with a Taser. Two more officers then enter to help restrain the inmate.

The video was released as part of a larger case involving Hunter, who is suing the City of Denver and individual officers with claims of rampant corruption inside of the Denver County Jail.

The video shows Deputy Edward Keller throwing Hunter into the cell, then immediately throwing him onto his bed and choking him. The officer that shocked Hunter with the Taser has been identified as Sgt. Anthony Mazzei, who used the Taser twice on Hunter.

According to The Denver Post, the incident began when Hunter spat and cursed at Keller, calling him a racist.

In an incident two weeks before the videotaped assault of Hunter, he was attacked by other inmates, allegedly under the supervision of the deputy assigned to monitor the pod that Hunter lived in.

According to court documents, Hunter was held down and beaten by one inmate, while another stood as a lookout. A third inmate then entered and poured a cup of scalding hot water onto Hunter, which severely burned him.

'I was attacked by inmates and it led to me being scalded very bad on my
 pelvis, my genitals, and it was just a terrible burn,' Hunter told 
CBS4.

The attack were spurred by inmates believing that Hunter was an informant. According to Hunter's lawsuit, an inmate was told this by Gaynel Rumer, the deputy in charge of the pod where Hunter lived.

In an affidavit from Amos Page, one of the inmates that participated in the July 18 attack on Hunter, Rumer told the inmate this information to 'poor [sic] gas on a fire.' Page claimed that Hunter would make fun of Rumer for drinking alcohol during his shift.

According to the affidavit, Rumer was in business with other inmates in the pod, allowing pornography, drugs and alcohol to be sold in exchange for a cut of the proceeds. Rumer would also assist the inmates in their administering beatings to other inmates who were 'snitches' or sex offenders.

'Rumer would let me control the pod. Rumer would allow me to give other inmates violations such as "50 punches to the chin" or "straight up two minutes" (two minutes with four homies)' said Page in the document. He also claimed to tell Hunter that 'this is not the spot for you' prior to the July 18 attack.

Footage of the July 31 incident was released as part of the order by U.S. District Judge John Kane, who has asked federal prosecutors to investigate the 'patterns and practices' of the sheriff's and police departments. Since the attacks on Hunter, other officers with both the police and sheriff's departments have been accused of intimidating witnesses involved in the matter.

'The police department and sheriff’s department I believe are conspiring,' Hunter told CBS4. 

Since the attacks, the Denver District's Attorney's Office has twice declined to prosecute the matter, a fact outraging Judge Kane.

'I think it…smacks of a sham to suggest that the Internal Affairs Bureau 
of the Denver Police Department was investigating any kind of a case for
 criminal activity on the part of the affiants, on the part of Mr. Page,
 or on the part of the plaintiff [Hunter] in this case,' said Kane.

In the July 31 incident, Deputy Keller was suspended for 30 days for using excessive force.

Rumer has denied the allegations made against him He was suspended for 40 days from his job.
