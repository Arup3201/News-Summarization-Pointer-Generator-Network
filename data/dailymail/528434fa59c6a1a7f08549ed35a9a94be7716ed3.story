Booted: UMass Amherst doctoral student Zahra Khalkhali was unceremoniously kicked out of her school and stripped of her visa

Behind UMass-Amherst's infamous ban on Iranian students studying at the university is a 31-year-old doctoral student from outside Tehran whose experience sparked the entire controversy.

Zahra Khalkhali was a second year PhD student whose research on fuel cells concerned university officials enough to drop her from the university late last year along with their sponsorship of her visa while she was visiting her home country.

While Khalkhali languished in Iran with little explanation and no one willing to help her, UMass-Amherst rewrote its policies concerning Iranian students.

Officials said the change was made to better conform to a 2012 federal law that makes Iranian citizens who are seeking degrees to prepare them for work in their country's energy sector ineligible for visas.

'I was very shocked and heartbroken,' Khalkhali told NBC News in a phone interview from Iran.

Before this year's chain of events, Khalkhali was a student in the highly regarded university's Mechanical and Industrial Engineering Department.

She was in her second year of study into fuel cells used to produce clean energy when she unceremoniously got the boot.

'They were all aware of my research,' she says of her administrators and colleagues. 'The university was aware what my PhD thesis was about.'

Nonetheless, she says she could find no one to vouch for her as she attempted to return to the country. So, hoping to convince the university in person, she flew to New York.

On January 14, NBC reports, Khalkhali was stopped at a New York airport, cuffed and held overnight before being shipped back to Iran.

Later in January, she would petition UMass to reconsider. Instead, the school hardened its policies regarding Iranian students.

Upon trying to return to the U.S. following a trip home to Iran, officials saw that Khalkhali's research at the university's Mechanical and Industrial Engineering Department involved energy production. The school feared ran counter to a 2012 federal law barring Iranian nationals in pursuit of degrees that could train them to work in their country's energy sector from getting visas

On February 6, the school officially banned Iranians from studying many hard science fields, some of which weren't even specified by the 2012 federal law.

At the time, the school claimed the policy change stemmed from 'an inquiry from a student.'

An outcry soon ensued from within Amherst and without as critics called foul on what they claimed were draconian new policies.

Then, on February 18, the school turned heel, deciding to reverse its decision to ban Iranian nationals from admission to certain graduate programs after consulting further with the State Department and private attorneys.

'We have always believed that excluding students from admission conflicts with our institutional values and principles. It is now clear, after further consultation and deliberation, that we can adopt a less restrictive policy,' said Michael Malone, vice chancellor for research and engagement.

The university said it will develop individualized study plans based on a student's projected coursework to meet the requirements of federal sanctions law.

Khalkhali, meanwhile, remains in limbo in Iran. However, UMass Chancellor Kumble R. Subbaswamy said in a statement to NBC on Tuesday:

'The student did not do anything wrong, and we regret that she endured a difficult and trying period at the airport.

'We are exploring how we might help her continue her education, and if we can identify an alternative line of study that fulfills the requirements of federal law.'

Zahra Khalkhali is a 31-year-old Iranian national whose doctoral research on fuel cells got her booted from UMass

Khalkhali was banned from returning to the US early this year after UMass dropped its sponsorship of her visa while she was visiting home

@highlight

After dropping her, UMass rewrote its policies to protect the school from a 2012 law banning Iranians from training for careers in Iran's energy sector

The school has since turned heel on its policy, but Khalkhali remains stuck in Iran
