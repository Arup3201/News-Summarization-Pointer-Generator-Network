Ammi Midstokke, 36, was pinned down by a huge rock which shifted as she walked across it

A mother has spoken of her relief at being rescued after her leg got trapped when a two-ton boulder shifted during a mountain hike.

Ammi Midstokke, 36, had to spend a night on Chimney Rock north of Coeur d'Alene at the weekend after she was pinned down by the huge rock which shifted as she walked across it.

Her hiking partner tried to free her leg, but when it became clear he could not move the boulder search-and-rescue teams were called.   

Bonner County emergency officials received a distress call about 5:30 p.m. Friday. 

More than 20 rescuers from Priest Lake Search and Rescue and the Bonner County EMS Wilderness Response Team set out on foot after 8 p.m. with rope, medical gear and pry bars 

It took until 12:49 a.m to reach the nutritional advisor because of the extremely steep, rocky terrain.

'This was the most technically difficult rescue we've done,' said Mike Nielsen, commander of Priest Lake Search and Rescue. 

'Rescuers had to cross a crumbling rock ledge that was only 10 inches in some places with packs on, in the dark, with only headlamps. 

'That's why it took so long to access her.' 

Midstokke wrote on her Facebook page: 'After a successful summit of Chimney Rock, a boulder came down on me while crossing the talus fields, pinning me in its path.

'Attempted self-rescue but it was both too heavy and too dangerous. 

Midstokke had to spend a night on Chimney Rock north of Coeur d'Alene at the weekend 

It took rescuers about 40 minutes to free the woman's leg using pry bars, mechanical advantage and muscle

Eight hours after she was first trapped rescuers were able to hoist the boulder and extract her foot. Her injuries were then stabilized, but rescuers couldn't bring her out in the dark so they spent the night.

'I couldn't have hoped for a more competent adventuring partner or a better group of rescuers,' she wrote on her Facebook page

'We called Search and Rescue and tried to stabilize me with heat and good stories. 

'Eight hours later, well past midnight, they were able to hoist the boulder and extract a very deformed, very dead looking foot. 

'There was much drama on my end as blood began to flow into the foot and the team transported me to safe ground. It was apparent that hiking out wasn't an option, so we hunkered down until the Air Force could lift me out after daylight. 

'Initial X rays show tarsal breakage but a remarkably whole foot. We'll know more later this week. 

Midstokke was picked up at 8:45 a.m. Saturday by a helicopter from the Fairchild Air Force Base in Spokane and was taken to a nearby hospital for treatment

She  posted photos of her swollen foot Facebook alongside an X-ray which she captioned: 'The foot stays!!!'

Midstokke, a nutritional advisor,  is now recovering after her ordeal

'I couldn't have hoped for a more competent adventuring partner or a better group of rescuers. 

'You guys are all my heroes!!!'

She also posted photos of her swollen foot on the social networking site alongside an X-ray which she captioned: 'The foot stays!!! Doctor says to move that bad a** appendage and keep the blood flowing.

Midstokke was hiking with Jason Luthy, a wilderness medicine instructor from Sandpoint. 

The pair chose the technical route to save time because it was four miles shorter than other routes.

It took rescuers about 40 minutes to free the woman's leg using pry bars, mechanical advantage and muscle, said  Bob Abbott, spokesman for the all-volunteer Priest Lake Search and Rescue.

Her injuries were then stabilized, but rescuers couldn't bring her out in the dark so they spent the night. 

Midstokke was picked up at 8:45 a.m. Saturday by a helicopter from the Fairchild Air Force Base in Spokane and was taken to a nearby hospital for treatment. 

Chimney Rock is a prominent outcropping in the Payette National Forest.
