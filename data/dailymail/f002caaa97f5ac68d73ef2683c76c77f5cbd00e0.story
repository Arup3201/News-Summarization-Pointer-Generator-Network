A mother and her two young children fled for their lives when an e-cigarette exploded, setting their flat on fire.

Keeley Cooper, 22, heard ‘an almighty bang’ as the device, which was charging, burst into flames.

She tried to extinguish the blaze, but it spread quickly and she raced to rescue sons Ellis, five, and Riegan, two.

A fireman told Miss Cooper the clouds of toxic smoke could have killed the  family if they had been asleep.

Yesterday
 she said: ‘I’d put it on charge next to my bed. It had been charging 
for 40 minutes when there was an almighty bang. It sounded like a 
firework.

‘It burst into 
flames and the carpet was on fire. I thought I had put the flames out 
but smoke began pouring from under the bed. I tried to lift it, but it 
was too heavy and the fire was getting worse.

‘The only thing I could do was get me and the kids out. I grabbed them and ran downstairs.’

Firefighters
 put out the flames, but the bedroom was gutted. The rest of the flat 
was badly damaged by smoke and the children’s toys and clothes had to be
 thrown out.

Miss Cooper had been using the e-cigarette as she quit a ten-a-day smoking habit.

She said: ‘I’ll never buy another e-cigarette and have no intention of returning to normal cigarettes.

‘If
 anybody has an electronic  cigarette I recommend you get rid of it now.
 Me and the kids have nothing left. It just isn’t worth it.’

The device came with a charging lead but no plug, she said, so she used a phone charger – contrary to the maker’s instructions.

Miss
 Cooper, who recently lost her job at a healthcare firm, is  now staying
 in a bed and breakfast while her council flat in Shard End, Birmingham,
 is repaired.

E-cigarettes are used by more than two million Britons – three times the number in 2012.

The blaze caused by the e-cigarette devastated the bedroom of Miss Cooper's flat in Shard End, Birmingham

Last
 year, Evelyn Raywood, 68, died as a result of a blaze apparently 
started by the battery of her device. It is the only fatality linked to 
e-cigarettes, but there have been a number of close calls.

Last
 month a hotel barmaid was engulfed in flame when one exploded as it was
 being charged with an iPhone charger. A pensioner was also badly burned
 when her e-cigarette ignited her oxygen supply.

And
 in Leicester, a woman’s car was set on fire when her e-cigarette 
exploded as it was being charged in the vehicle’s auxiliary socket.

E-cigarette
 manufacturer E-Lites yesterday said all of its products come with a 
charger. A spokesman said: ‘We are investigating whether a device of 
ours was involved. The fire service is echoing the clear advice in our 
instructions that e-cigarettes should only be recharged using the 
charger supplied.’

West 
Midlands Fire Service issued advice on e-cigarettes in March after two 
incidents, including one in which hot liquid shot across an office when a
 battery exploded.

A spokesman said firefighters needed breathing apparatus in the ‘severe fire’ at Miss Cooper’s flat.

He
 said: ‘This is another example of the dangers of using the wrong 
chargers with the wrong devices. Don’t mix and match your chargers and 
cables.’

E-cigarettes contain nicotine but not, manufacturers say, the cancer-causing materials in cigarettes.

Leonardo
 DiCaprio, Cheryl Cole and Twilight star Robert Pattinson are fans. But a
 US analysis found traces of carcinogenic substances.

And e-cigarettes with sweet flavours such as chocolate and candy floss have been blamed for getting children hooked on nicotine.

All of the family's possessions have been ruined in the blaze, which has left them living in a B&B

The
 latest incident comes after fire crews investigating a fire
 in East London earlier this year said they believe the blaze was started by an 
e-cigarette on charge.

More
 than 20 firefighters tackled the fire in a ground floor flat in Barking
 and rescued a woman, who was taken to hospital with smoke inhalation 
and shock.

Fire
 chiefs investigating the incident said they believe an e-cigarette 
could have overheated while it was plugged into a mains socket.

In April this year, a pensioner was engulfed in flames on a ward at the Wythenshawe Hospital in Manchester in another incident.

It is believed 65-year-old Jean Booth used an e-cigarette while she was on oxygen in her hospital bed and was left badly burned.

Just
 two weeks earlier, an e-cigarette exploded in a barmaid's face while it
 was being charged near the bar of a pub in Richmond, North Yorkshire.

Barmaid Laura Baty was burned when her e-cigarette exploded while it was charging

Laura Baty, 18, managed to quickly turn away from the flames  - but was left with a burnt dress and a injured arm.

Following
 the spate of incidents, fire investigator Charlie Pugsley said: 'People
 assume e-cigarettes are much safer than ordinary cigarettes, and in 
most cases they are.

'The
 danger is that people sometimes use incorrect chargers which runs the 
risk of over-charging, which can potentially have explosive results.'
