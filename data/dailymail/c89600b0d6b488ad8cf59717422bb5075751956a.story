Minnesota Vikings' star running back Adrian Peterson has been suspended without pay for at least the remainder of 2014 season after he was spared jail for hitting his son, the NFL said today.

Peterson, 29, has 'shown no meaningful remorse' for his conduct, NFL Commissioner Roger Goodell said in a statement released on Tuesday.

He will not be considered for reinstatement before April 15 for violating the NFL Personal Conduct Policy in an 'incident of abusive discipline that he inflicted on his four-year-old son'.

The league said in its statement that Peterson is allowed to appeal its decision in writing within three days and if he does, he will continue to be paid pending a decision.

The NFL Players Association swiftly announced on Tuesday that it does plan to appeal the decision and will demand a neutral party to hear the appeal. 

The announcement comes two weeks after Peterson pleaded no contest to misdemeanor reckless assault - down from a felony charge of child abuse - for disciplining his son with a wooden switch.

The child, who has not been named, was left with cuts, marks and bruising to his thighs, back and one of his testicles, according to court records, and backlash from the public was strong.  

In his letter to Peterson, Goodell said he had reached his decision because the victim was just four and significantly smaller than the professional athlete.

'While an adult may have a number of options when confronted with abuse – to flee, to fight back, or to seek help from law enforcement – none of those options is realistically available to a four-year old child,' Goodell wrote.

He added that the wooden switch was essentially a weapon he had used against the boy.

Goodell also expressed his concern that the player had shown no awareness of the harm he had caused, and had repeatedly stood up for his actions. 

'We are prepared to put in place a program that can help you to succeed, but no program can succeed without your genuine and continuing engagement,' he said.  

'You must commit yourself to your counseling and rehabilitative effort, properly care for your children, and have no further violations of law or league policy.'

After the court's decision on November 4, Peterson received two years of probation, plus a $4,000 fine and requirement to complete parenting classes and 80 hours of community service. 

'I'm just glad this is over,' Peterson said after the plea deal was announced in Texas. 'I can put this behind me, and me and my family can move forward.'

Peterson's attorney, Rusty Hardin, added: 'Adrian wants to get on with his life and have his relationship with his son and get back to playing football,' said after the plea agreement was reached. 

Earlier this month, the NFL informed Peterson that he would remain on paid leave from the Vikings until they concluded their review of his case under their personal conduct policy.

His weekly in-season salary came to more than $690,000. 

Tuesday's decision came after Goodell was criticized for his initial leniency after Baltimore's Ray Rice knocked out his now-wife in an elevator, in a harrowing incident that was caught on camera.

Weeks after handing Rice a two-game suspension, Goodell announced in August he was toughening the league's policy on domestic violence that now calls for a six-game suspension without pay for a first domestic violence offense. 

The league boss was under intense scrutiny for how he handled punishment for Peterson.

But it hadn't been clear how the league would deal with Peterson because he had maintained he intended no harm in seeking to discipline his son the way he was as a child growing up in Texas.

His plea was not an admission of guilt, and the felony was reduced to a misdemeanor. 

After the accusations initially emerged, a major Vikings sponsor suspended its partnership, while other corporations expressed concerns to the team and the league, and Peterson was dropped as an endorser of several brands. 

The Vikings have been quiet since Peterson's plea agreement, stating only that they will speak about his situation 'at the appropriate time'.
