A tourist had to be rescued from a mountainside via helicopter after she attempted to climb  the 7,109ft-high Dobratsch Mountain in flip-flops.

Maria Schneider, 23, from Vienna, was trying to hike the peak, near Villach, Austria, when she got stuck and was unable to go any further.

And she was also unable to get back down due to her unsuitable footwear.

When rescuers arrived on the steep mountainside they also found Schneider was not dressed for the walk correctly and did not have any warm clothing nor Alpine equipment with her.

A police helicopter, eight mountain rescuers, and an Alpine policeman were used in the rescue.

The woman was airlifted off the peak and was uninjured in the ordeal.

Summer sees many rescues from mountainsides from people ill-equipped for the conditions.

Only last week a British soldier who tackled the frozen Austrian Alps wearing just shorts and a T-shirt had been rapped by officials after he had to be rescued from the snowy peak. 

Long way down: The tourist had to be rescued while attempting the 7,000ft high Dobratsch mountain

Rescuers in Hohe Tauern, a mountain range near the western city of Salzburg, say the 37-year-old man had ignored warnings that he could freeze to death wearing kit more suitable for a day the beach than a mountain top.

Conditions were so bad that a helicopter rescue was abandoned when the chopper could not fly high enough to reach the climber who was 10,100 feet up the mountain.

Officials say he was warned when he reached an Alpine hut at 7,100 feet that he could die if he went any higher in his T-shirt, shorts, and trainers.

But he ignored the warning and climbed a further thousand metres before he called for help.

After the helicopter rescue was abandoned, local climbers braved snow and ice falls to rescue the stricken soldier, who was taken back down to the nearest rescue hut.
