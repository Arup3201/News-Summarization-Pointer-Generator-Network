The owner of a used car showroom in Devon has been ordered to remove decorative bunting from his premesis - because it could be too much of a distraction for passing motorists.

Reg Payne, who owns West Country Car Sales, was asked to take down his decorative flags which hang outside his business near Cullompton following a council planning meeting on Wednesday.

The bunting was one of the concerns raised when Mr Payne presented an application to expand his car dealership.

The council raised the bunting issue as a matter of concern when he applied to expand the size of his business

Councillors were divided in opinion over the plan, with those opposing the expansion citing the appearance of the site as one of their biggest concerns.

Councillor Barry Warren, planning chairman of Willand Parish Council said there was a 'kaleidoscope' of colours of cars on the site and said there were worries of the visual impact the business had on its surroundings.

Mr Payne said: 'It's absolutely ridiculous. I'm doing nothing other than trying to make a living here.'

This follows an earlier decision by Nottingham City Council workers who erected a 20mph speed limit sign on a footpath.  

The sign in Dulwich Road was placed at a dead end in front of a set of bollards, which enclose a pedestrian-only zone in the residential area.

Dorothy Francis, 89, who has lived in the area all her life, said: ‘It’s bizarre, you can barely even get a bicycle through the gap in those bollards never mind a car.

‘The sign is actually on the pavement, it’s not like it’s a few yards before, there would be no chance to get up to speed before you hit the bollards.

‘I know we old dears can hit some speed in our mobility scooters but this is taking it a bit too far.’

In Yorkshire, Craven District Council has ordered its refuse collectors not to drag bins along residential driveways. 

Councillor Paul English branded the move 'crazy' saying it was 'health and safety gone mad'.

He said: 'When you apply to be a refuse collector it is pretty obvious you will be expected to collect refuse. It is kind of part of the job description.

'Wheelie bins have wheels and are easy to move around and refuse collectors are trained to do it. It is like telling a footballer not to play football in case he breaks his leg.

'If [health and safety bosses] says it is dangerous for all these big strapping lads to move the bins, what about all the little old ladies who are going to have to do it instead?'
