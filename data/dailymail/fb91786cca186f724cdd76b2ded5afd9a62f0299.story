She's the world's most famous model and has been a clothes horse for the likes of Versace and Louis Vuitton but Kate Moss wants everyone to know she has brains as well as beauty.

The supermodel revealed she's such a stickler for correct grammar that it takes her too long to text people.

'I am a grammar snob. Capital letters, commas - everything has to be perfect, I can't stand it [texting] otherwise. So it takes too long so I just call instead,' she told The Guardian in an interview about her new collaboration with Carphone Warehouse.

Grammar police: Kate Moss said she is extremely fussy when it comes to spelling and grammar

The High Street phone brand might not
be as glamorous as her usual collaborations, but as demonstrated in the designs, the 39-year-old has managed to inject some serious style into everyone's 
favourite accessory.

The collection draws inspiration from the supermodel's own wardrobe and is intended to capture her classic, 
understated style in a range of leather and metallic cases.

'I wanted to do something that was 
feminine, not tacky and plastic,' she said.

The designs are simple and subtle and all come in the fash pack's favourite colour: black.

They
include a patent crocodile skin design with gold
embellishment that Kate designed around her favourite vintage lighter; a
bold metallic, star case that was inspired by a diamond necklace from 
Kate’s jewellery box; and the simple anchor emblem taken from a tattoo 
on her wrist that has become her personal monogram across the whole 
range.

Tech savvy: She may be busy partying and posing for high fashion campaigns but Kate Moss still loves playing on the apps on her phone

'The range is a reflection of my personal style and every piece was 
inspired by something I already own and wear. After spending time 
designing each piece individually, I’ve loved seeing the range and my 
vision come to life,' she added.

In true fashionista style, Kate changes phone accessories to 
match her outfit - even down to the colour of her zip. She said she would never wear a dress with a gold zip with a silver phone case as she confessed: 'I am a bit OCD about not mixing silver and gold.'

And whilst she may not partake in texting very often, Kate is somewhat addicted to her smartphone apps.

She is on picture sharing site Instagram but uses a codename to maintain her privacy. As a result, she only has around ten followers, six of whom are children.

But her all-time favourite app is the 'addictive' Dumb Ways to Die - a game that invites players to avoid dangerous activities.

Last month pictures were released of 
Kate meeting with the Carphone Warehouse team to discuss her collection,
which is geared towards 'fashion conscious smartphone users'.

Her latest career move is a bit more down to earth than her usual high fashion jobs for exclusive designers including Chanel and Burberry.

She is working on the range for an undisclosed fee and Carphone Warehouse believes adding her touch to the humble phone case 
will tempt female customers who see her as a style icon.

The company recruited the model in a bid to cash in on what it calls 'fashion tech' – or phone 
accessories aimed at customers who 'are crying out' for something more 
stylish than cheap plastic cases.

Kate
said this is something she can identify with. She said: 'My phone’s as 
much a part of my look as my bag or shoes, and yet there’s so little 
choice out there.'
