He's spent most of the last seven years in prison, has been arrested more than 20 times and missed seeing his children grow up.Why? Because 'Naked Rambler' Stephen Gough simply won't keep his clothes on in public.

Now Mr Gough, 55, from Hampshire, is to appear in a new documentary in which he attempts to explain the reasoning behind the nudity that has left him a stranger to his teenage son and daughter.

Although imprisoned earlier this month, this time for close to two years, the former marine claims that his love of baring all is  - despite the repeated spells in jail - all about freedom.

Defiant: Stephen Gough, aka the Naked Rambler, says he has no plans to stop walking while in the buff

Long suffering: Alison Ward, Mr Gough's former wife, finds his behaviour hard to understand

'I like wearing clothes but the thing 
about clothes is that I want to be able to wear what I want to wear,' he explains in a scene from the BBC One film.

'I 
get up in the morning and I want to put on what I want... Some people, 
like naturists and that, nudists, they heat up their house especially so
 they can go naked and I think that's nuts. I stand for freedom.'

One person who's far from convinced by his claims is his former wife Alison Ward, who says she's baffled by his insistence on going naked.

'It is extraordinary, really,' she says. 'I don't 
think the legal system can believe that someone, given the choice of "put
 your clothes on and you're a free man" or "you don't and we'll lock you 
up in solitary confinement", would choose "oh, solitary confinement for 
me please".

'I don't think anyone saw that coming.'

Since his nude rambling career began with a walk from Land's End to John O'Groats in 2004, Mr Gough has been arrested countless times and has spent years in prison.

Although appearing nude in public isn't technically a crime, if someone complains, it can be considered a breach of the peace or more seriously, an outrage to public decency.

Mr Gough's most recent conviction, for breaching an ASBO that banned him from being naked in public places, resulted in a 16-month sentence.

Recorder John Williams, who presided over the court, told him: 'I’m afraid there is going to be a revolving door in and out of prison, 
because you are intent on flouting these orders and there is absolutely 
no way you are going to comply with them.’

Chilly: During the new film, Mr Gough is seen walking in the rain, the snow and in temperatures of -1 while nude

Under arrest: Mr Gough photographed during one of his many arrests. There have now been more than 20

Home: After walking back from Scotland last year, Mr Gough was in trouble within days of arriving

It's an attitude that has left his 86-year-old mother Nora baffled. 'I don't understand why he's doing it,' she sighs.

'I 
never have understood it. I know it's something to
 do with freedom but he's not free, is he? Stuck in jail for six 
years... That's not free!

'It seems that's a useless way of living your 
life to me.'

Gough, however, believes that his mission to share his insight about the freedom nudity brings is important and claims that his naked rambling is of genuine help to people.

'I help them to confront their 
false beliefs about who they are,' he explains. They need someone like me to come along and 
challenge them.

'We consider ourselves a democratic and free society but how far does that go? There's a bigger thing at stake.'

He pauses and adds: 'I'm not sure what it 
is but... ' before trailing off.

Once again, it seems that not every member of the public is happy to embrace his views. During one scene in the new film, he's seen blithely wandering past a school as the children leave - much to the outrage of the parents.

In another, he's heckled by an irate passer-by in Scotland, who tells him: 'You're a disgrace! A real disgrace!

He adds: 'That
 does not do any good in this day and age for this country. What point 
is he trying to prove? He's not proving anything to anyone apart from 
that he's an idiot.'

Despite the brickbats and the ever-growing amount of time spent at Her Majesty's pleasure, Gough remains committed to his unusual mission, despite the impact it has had on his family.

'That's just how life's turned out,' he muses. 'I don't 
regret it, even though it means I've been separated from my children.

'Sometimes, you've got to follow your passions in life even when that
 means you can't be with your children or people you love.' You can only hope that his children agree.
