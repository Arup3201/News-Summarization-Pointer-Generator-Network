After a horrifying motorcycle accident shattered his ankle into 15 pieces, James Ketchell was told he would never walk normally again.

But seven years on, the 31 year-old has defied his doctors concerns and is set to become the first person ever to climb Everest, row the Atlantic and cycle around the world.

In 2007, he was warned he would have a severe limp after the accident which left him with a severely broken ankle, leg and hand.

However Mr Ketchell from Holloway in London, fought back during his recovery and, three years later, he single-handedly rowed 3,000 miles across the Atlantic.

Journey: During his 18,000-mile cycle ride, he passed many monuments including the Golden Gate Bridge. he managed to complete the feat despite breaking his leg after a horrific motorcycle accident in 2007

The following year he climbed to the top of Mount Everest in just six weeks and has now returned home after cycling 18,000 miles around the world - through more than 20 countries in 214 days.

Mr Ketchell said: 'After my accident, I felt I needed something to do to prove to myself that I'm alright. I think I've done that now.

'Mentally, the cycle was the toughest part of my triathlon, but physically it was climbing Everest. The Atlantic row was actually quite enjoyable.

'I had to push myself every day. You're only really living when you're outside of your comfort zone, and I definitely couldn't have done it without my friends and family.'

Mr Ketchell said that in comparison to the other two challenges, the trans-Atlantic row was  actually 'enjoyable'

Perilous: He had to tackle some potentially dangerous situations during his journey

Last June, Mr Ketchell began his final leg of what he's dubbed 'The Ultimate Triathlon' when he left Greenwich to embark on his bike ride around the world.

He landed back in Britain on a ferry at Portsmouth then cycled to Brighton before heading to the finish line at Greenwich Royal Observatory.

He said: 'I had to push myself every day. It was so hard getting on the bike first thing in the morning, knowing I had to cycle 100 miles before I could rest, no matter what the weather.

'I had a few scary moments. In India I was chased by angry armed guards because I had accidentally set up camp somewhere I shouldn't.

'And then a few days later I was knocked off my bike by a tuk tuk. Luckily I was okay and I could get the bike fixed. That's what adventuring is all about, really.'

Mr Ketchell's longest leg during the trip was a 262-mile cycle from Kuala Lumpur to Singapore, an impressive feat he completed after 20 hours of solid pedalling.

While he was not trying to break any records for the fastest journeys, his Atlantic row was completed in an impressive 110 days - and he climbed Everest in only six weeks.

'After my bike accident, the doctors were pretty bleak. But I've never been one to let people tell me what to do, so I just decided to do the maddest, toughest challenge I could think of,' he said.

'I could have sat and felt sorry for myself, or I could do something about it. I think I made the right choice.'

Speaking about his 2007 accident, Mr Ketchell said: 'I was thrown off my motorbike at 70mph coming out of a corner, which resulted in a broken hand, leg and ankle.

'The worst injury was to my ankle, which was dislocated and smashed into 15 pieces. Doctors told me I wouldn't be able to walk normally again.

Finish: On his return to Britain, he was greeted by friends and family

Troop: Members from his loyal Scout group were also there to greet him on his arrival

'The rehabilitation was long and painful, but worth it.

'At first progress was slow but the more I did the exercises, the stronger and more movement I got back in my ankle.'

As a Scouting Ambassador, Mr Ketchell will travel around the country giving talks to Scouts and schoolchildren about his experiences.

Next year, the intrepid adventurer is planning on rowing across the Indian Ocean with a pal, who suffers from epilepsy, to highlight how much life can be enjoyed by people with the condition.

He has been raising money for the ELIFAR Foundation, a charity which helps to improve the quality of life for disabled children and adults.
