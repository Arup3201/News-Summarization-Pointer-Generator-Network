As London Fashion Week kicks off in  the UK tomorrow, models will be stalking the catwalks with unsmiling faces and serious expressions.

Not so, Sarah Ferguson, the Duchess of York, who made sure to grin, grimace and mug her way down the runway for Naomi Campbell's Fashion For Relief show at Somerset House on Thursday night.

Wearing a long black dress with her hair falling loose around her shoulders, Sarah, 55, gave something of a performance, spreading her arms wide as she joined a range of celebrities to raise money for the war against Ebola.

The high necked, sleeveless dress hugged the duchess's figure but she managed to sashay on the graphic-print runway in black high heeled courts.

Her jewellery was kept simple with pearl earrings, a delicate silver necklace with an opal at its centre, and a silver bracelet strewn with stones.

The event kicks off London Fashion Week, which officially opens tomorrow, with a fundraising showcase that teams famous faces with renowned designers. 

It's not the first time the duchess has strutted her stuff for a good cause as she's something of a Fashion Relief regular.

She rarely wears anything other than black, and her appearances in the charity shows have been no exception with her wearing  a series of long inky garments.

In 2007, she showed off her generous enbonpoint while walking the runway with daughter Princess Beatrice.

She kept her hands resolutely at her sides for the event raising money to help the fight against ebola

Famous for her outgoing personality, the Duchess of York didn't hold back in Somerset House tonight

In 2005 she joined the fashion benefit to aid victims of Hurricane Katrina and in 2010, she donned a voluminous black kaftan for Haiti event.

Supermodel Naomi Campbell launched Fashion For Relief in 2005 to help those affected by Hurricane Katrina. Since then more than £5 million has been raised, with victims of the 2011 Japanese tsunami and floods in the UK benefiting.

Tonight at the £50-a-head event, the duchess joined celebrities like Katie Price, in a tuxedo and red lipstick, Pixie Lott, Vivienne Westwood, Georgia May Jagger, Caroline Flack and Katie Piper on the catwalk.

Dresses were donated by designers including Dolce & Gabbana, Givenchy, Alexander McQueen, Azzedine Alaia, Vivienne Westwood, Stella McCartney, Balmain, Marchesa and Versace.

Naomi, who also lent her star-power to the catwalk, said: 'I'm thrilled to return to London to open London Fashion Week for this very special cause close to my heart.

'The Fashion For Relief Show is an incredible event and this year we hope to raise more money than ever before. 

'Raising awareness for Ebola and educating about its prevention is crucial to help prevent the spread of this deadly disease.'
