The Super Bowl is expected to make today the busiest day in history at Arizona's largest airport, but snowstorms and winter weather elsewhere could cause delays.

Phoenix's Sky Harbor International Airport said on Sunday night that winter weather on the East Coast, could delay flights to Boston, New York and other destinations.

About 80,000 passengers were expected to depart from Sky Harbor, almost twice the normal traffic for an average day, the Transportation Security Administration said.

Airport officials were concerned football fans would be stuck in Arizona but flight delays have been minimal 

Essex County Airport in Caldwell Fairfield, New Jersey, New Bedford Regional Airport in New Bedford, Massachusetts and Francis S. Gabreski Airport  in Suffolk County, New York, were all temporarily closed due to snow on Monday. 

Some flights to La Guardia Airport outside of New York City were also delayed. 

Sky Harbor is encouraging travelers to check on their flight status ahead of time because of the weather uncertainties. 

Lines were moving well at TSA checkpoints as of 8.40am according to the airport's Twitter account.

The airport said in a release: 'The day after Super Bowl XLIX, will be Phoenix Sky Harbor's busiest day on record with a 60 percent increase in traffic. 

'An average day at Sky Harbor sees about 110,000 passengers while February 2, could see 180,000 passengers. 

'Additionally, an average day sees about 1,200 takeoffs and landings at Phoenix Sky Harbor, while February 2, the airport expects approximately 1,600 takeoffs and landings.'

Football fans who went to the Super Bowl are being asked to keep their game programs with their carry-on luggage because they contain metallic ink which can set off alarms during security screening for checked bags.

The airport is also advising passengers to check in for their flights and print their boarding passes before coming to Sky Harbor. 

Sky Harbor, nicknamed America’s Friendliest Airport, is one of the ten busiest airports in the US. 

According to traveler Peter Carline, who was at Sky Harbor on Monday, 'a plane taking off every three minutes mean there is little Super Bowl hangover in Arizona'

Peter Carline of London was traveling back to the UK by way of Minneapolis, Minnesota, after coming to Arizona for the Super Bowl. 

He told MailOnline: 'I checked in online before travelling, took the light rail to the airport and was intrigued by a sign saying 'early bag check'.

'In less than two minutes I was checked in and relieved of my heavy suitcase. I was advised to head straight to security by the staff, who were terrific. An excellent service.

'Planes were lined up on the runways as I glided over them on the efficient PHX Sky Train. 

'I arrived at Terminal 4 at 11:11 and five minutes later a queue of 32 people was quickly moving into the security check area. 

'By 11.21 I had passed all checks and was eyeing up food near my gate with an hour and a half to kill. 

'PHX brands itself as America's friendliest airport. You could replace the adjective to efficient and it would be equally true.

'Free wi-fi, lightning-fast security checks and a plane taking off every three minutes mean there is little Super Bowl hangover in Arizona.'

In the hours before the big game on Sunday, which saw the New England Patriots defeat the Seattle Seahawks 28-24, dense fog in Phoenix caused numerous delays and cancellations. 

Sky Harbor's acting aviation director, Tamie Fisher, said: 'Our staff has been preparing for more than a year.'

'We have been working with the airlines, TSA, car rental companies, law enforcement, the Arizona Super Bowl Host Committee, the NFL, our restaurant operators and other organizations to develop special operational and staffing plans to give our visitors a world class airport experience.
