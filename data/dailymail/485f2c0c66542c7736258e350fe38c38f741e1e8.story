After coming under fire for her ‘wooden’ performance on last week’s Strictly Come Dancing, Judy Murray has been desperately trying to shake things up.

But judging by these rehearsal pictures, she has some way to go yet.

The mother of tennis star Andy still looked rather rigid as she practised with dance partner Anton du Beke ahead of tonight’s show, managing an awkward grin as she moved through a tense routine.

Long way to go: The mother of tennis star Andy still looked rather rigid as she practised with dance partner Anton du Beke ahead of tonight’s show

A show insider conceded Mrs Murray is ‘still a bit wooden’, but insisted she has improved, saying: ‘She used to be as stiff as an old oak tree. Now she’s more like a bendy Scots pine.’

Fortunately for Judy, however, Strictly is a game of doubles – and the popularity of du Beke, 48, could be enough to save her.

Despite Mrs Murray’s struggles on the dancefloor, show judge Len Goodman backed the 55-year-old to progress in the competition with the help of du Beke’s fans.

The 70-year-old told ITV’s Loose Women: ‘People love Anton, and I understand why. He’s such a nice guy. So if they are not going to vote for his partner, they will think oh, I’ll vote for him.’

Others have suggested Mrs Murray could benefit from a partisan block of Scottish voters.

Last week she escaped elimination despite being handed the lowest score of the night – 17 points out of 40. At the time, Craig Revel Horwood sniped that her body was as ‘tight as a newly-strung racket, very stiff and tense’.

Escaped: Despite being handed the lowest score of the night - 17 points out of 40 - she avoided the chop when MasterChef host Gregg Wallace was put in the bottom two by public vote before losing the dance-off

A show insider said Mrs Murray is not expected to find herself in a dance-off any time soon thanks to the ‘Anton effect’, adding: ‘He is so popular with the viewers. They love him.’

While he has never won the show, du Beke famously made it to the quarter-final in 2010 with former MP Ann Widdecombe, 67, despite scoring consistently low marks throughout the series.

Tonight, he and Mrs Murray will be hoping to impress American singer Donny Osmond, who is appearing as a guest judge. He will also sing in tomorrow’s episode.
