The Associated Press reported the development from a source who would not be named, as the Houston Rockets have not officially announced the deal.

Other reports suggested that the Knicks are willing to match any contract deal offered to their star point guard.

The contract for Lin is said to be worth $10.2 million over the first two seasons and $9.3 million in each of the last two years. The fourth season is a team option.

Lin was claimed by the Knicks after the Rockets let him go and soon became New York's starting point guard and 'Linsanity' ensued.

Winning streak: Lin was one of the Knicks' key players last season, averaging 14.6 points a game

He averaged 14.6 points, 6.2 assists and 3.1 rebounds in 35 games with 25 starts before his season was cut short because of torn knee cartilage.

The point guard from Harvard, an elite college better known as a springboard to the U.S. presidency than to basketball success, galvanized a struggling Knicks team last season and inspired a craze dubbed 'Linsanity' by New York's tabloids.

Lin, the first Taiwanese-American to play in the NBA, rose from total obscurity to hero status after averaging 25.3 points and 8.3 assists in his first three starts, leading the Knicks in victories that captivated the city and Asian-Americans.

His hero status grew with a remarkable stretch in February where he scored at least 20 points in nine of 10 games.

A high point of that span came when he scored 38 points with seven assists in a 92-85 win over the Lakers on Feb. 10.

The Rockets are already popular in Asia because of the career of former star Yao Ming, who retired in 2011. With Yao's retirement, Lin could add to their appeal there as the first American-born player of Chinese or Taiwanese decent.
