A majority of voters say the quality of public services has been maintained or improved – despite government cuts.

A survey commissioned by the BBC showed that most voters believe schools, bus services, parks, libraries and bin collections have improved in the past five years, even as budgets have been reduced.

Overall, six out of ten people think public services have maintained or improved their quality.The Tories welcomed the poll’s findings, but accused the BBC of failing to give its own poll due prominence in its news bulletins.

Glee: David Cameron expressed his delight at the BBC being forced to admit services had got better

Conservative Party chairman Grant Shapps said the corporation had been among the first to scaremonger about the impact of the Government’s austerity measures to reduce Britain’s budget deficit, and accused it of downplaying its own findings that voters do not agree.

‘Their survey obviously didn’t produce the results they expected. It didn’t fit their agenda. So they buried it way down their broadcast list and made it tough to find on their website,’ Mr Shapps said.

‘They were the first to talk doom when we took these measures to stop Britain going bust.

Better: In most areas only around on in five people think services have got worse int he last five years

Quality: The survey revealed that satisfaction was highest among the people who actually use the services in question

A Tory minister has lashed out at the BBC over its coverage of climate change, claiming it gives too much prominence to sceptics.

The Climate Change Minister complained that the publicly-funded BBC still focused on the 'sterile' debate over whether global warming existed when most scientists are firmly in one camp.

He told the Science and Technology committee: 'In the case of the BBC they have a very clear statutory responsibility. It's in the original charter to inform.

'I think we need the BBC to look very hard, particularly at whether or not they are getting the balance right. I don't think they are.'He added: 'I think there is too much focus on trying to stimulate an increasingly sterile debate on the science, given the overwhelming body of opinion that there is now in favour of the science, and perhaps if they are wanting to have an active debate they should be talking about the policy responses to that science, rather than the science itself.

'I'm not trying to ban all dissenting voices but we are doing the public a disservice by treating them as equal, which is not the case.'

A fifth of people think care for the 
elderly has got worse, while a third believe the standard of Britain’s 
hospitals has declined, even though the Coalition has protected the NHS 
budget.

Professor Tony 
Travers, of the London School of Economics, said the findings would be 
used by the Treasury to demonstrate that cuts do not necessarily lead to
 poorer services. He added: ‘Ministers are likely to use this poll to 
argue for further cuts.’

Local
 government minister Brandon Lewis said: ‘This survey shows that in many
 areas such as rubbish collections, schools and libraries, services and 
value for money are improving, illustrating how councils can both 
deliver sensible savings and protect the frontline.’

A
 BBC spokesman said: ‘We’re surprised by any claim we haven’t reasonably
 covered the finding of the ICM report into public services.

‘This
 has been reported widely across the BBC, including on BBC Breakfast, 
the Today programme, 5live, BBC News Channel, and the News at One. It is
 also currently in the running orders for the evening bulletins.’

They should put the same energy into 
explaining what’s actually happened. As this government made difficult 
cuts to prevent this country from going bust, the BBC led their news 
with any survey suggesting Armageddon would follow.

‘The
 fact is, instead of listening to the daily scare stories of the last 
few years, families recognised that crucial savings needed to be made, 
waste has been cut, efficiency injected and services actually improved –
 that’s a story that deserves proper coverage across all sides of the 
media.’

At Prime Minister’s
 Questions, David Cameron mocked the BBC’s grudging report of its poll, 
saying he thought he had ‘died and gone to heaven’ when he heard it.

The
 ICM poll of 1,031 people did identify some areas of concern. People are
 fed up with potholes, with two thirds of people saying the standard of 
roads has worsened.
