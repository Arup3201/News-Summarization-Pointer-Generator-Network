British grandmother Lindsay Sandiford faces an agonising wait of up to 18 weeks before she learns whether a new appeal against her death sentence has been successful.

The day after Britain's Court of Appeal ruled the UK government was not obliged to pay for an 'adequate lawyer' for her in Bali, a local solicitor has agreed to continue fighting for her without charge - for now.

Fadillah Agus said today that he had lodged a last-ditch appeal to Indonesia's highest authority, the Supreme Court. He added that he hoped that friends and supporters would be able to find the £8,000 she needs to cover his fees.

Running out of options: Lindsay Sandiford sits in her cell knitting while on death row in Kerobokan prison, Bali. Her lawyer has lodged a last-ditch appeal against her death sentence to Indonesia's Supreme Court

Sandiford, 56, from Cheltenham - who was condemned to death for carrying £1.6million worth of cocaine into Bali last year - has already lost one appeal to a lower court and her options are now running out.

With a second appeal now formally lodged by Mr Agus, he has 14 days to submit to the Supreme Court the actual grounds of her appeal against death.

Sandiford will then have to wait for up to 18 weeks before the Supreme Court judges announce whether she has been successful.

Should she lose again, her lawyer can ask force a judicial review and should that fail only a plea for mercy to the President would be able to save the grandmother from the firing squad.

The Foreign Office has refused to pay for Sandiford's fight through the Indonesian courts as a matter of policy. Officials say that paying her fees would open the floodgates for all other Britons in trouble with the law overseas.

Lord Dyson, sitting with two other judges at the Court of Appeal yesterday, said the court had given 'very careful consideration' to the issues raised in what he described as a 'troubling' case.

He said the reasons for the judgment would be given 'as soon as possible'.

Lord Dyson, when announcing the decision to dismiss the appeal, said it was 'obviously a terribly serious matter'.

He said it was 'most unfortunate' that the sum required to secure the representation sought by the appellant - roughly £6,000 - was 'relatively speaking' a 'very small sum indeed'.

The judge added: 'But that cannot affect the principle that we have had to consider and it cannot affect our decision.

'But it may be that other means may be found to secure the relatively small sum in the course of the next few days.'

Mr Agus has agreed to fight on without payment but admits he hopes Sandiford's friends can come up with the further £6,000 to add to the £2,000 they have managed to club together.

'I lodged an official notification to appeal to the Supreme Court through the district court Denpasar (Bali's capital)', he said today.

The lack of money, he said, 'will not change my position to defend Lindsay because I don't defend her only for the money.'

He hit out at the British government's decision not to fund his client's case.

'I can't comprehend it,' he said. 'Even Indonesia tries to defend its citizens when they are facing serious problems overseas.'

Mr Agus said the Supreme Court would consider the second appeal in a closed hearing and announce its decision at a later stage, which could be up to four months.

In an open letter before the British court handed down its ruling, Sandiford said she hoped lessons would be learned if she was eventually put to death.

'If I should die - and I hope I don't, but I fear I may - then I hope that my execution will prompt the British government to do more for others,' she said.
