When you are the unchallenged leader of North Korea, it comes with the job to me fawned over by your loyal subjects – at least these ones aren’t crying.

Young dictator Kim Jong-Un was surrounded by a horde of adoring women as he toured an air force unit at an unknown location in North Korea.

Women dressed in military uniforms and mid-20th century style pilot outfits did their best to hook on to the comfortably sized arm of the 31-year-old leader.

K.I.M.P: Kim Jong-Un is surrounded by a horde of adoring female soldiers and pilots while touring an air force unit in North Korea

The pictures were released by North 
Korea's ruling Workers party, on Friday via Korean Central News Agency,
 but it is not clear when they were taken or where the airfield is 
located.

They show Kim 
Jong-Un meeting soldiers and pilots at the unit and supervising a flight
 drill of the KPA Air and Anti-Air Force Unit 2620.

The
 images emerged as the leader’s second-in command, has reappeared in 
official television footage, contradicting reports earlier this month 
that he had been executed by Jong-Un.

Rumoured No.2, Choe Ryong-Hae was pictured close to Kim in pictures taken in January and February, smiling but sporting a limp.

He was seen enthusiastically taking notes on a visit by Kim to various sites and then appeared at a firing drill on a beach.

Choe
 is the influential head of the political wing of North Korea's military
 and appears to have risen to become the second most powerful person in 
the country after the execution of Jang Song-Thaek, Kim's uncle, last 
year.

Speculation in recent 
weeks that Choe had also been purged triggered a wave of speculation 
that Kim was intent on shaking up North Korea's elite and that 
high-ranking members within it were planning a coup.

Later
 this weekend, the North Korean people will vote in a ‘national 
election’ – virtually all are expected to vote yes to their candidates, 
all selected for them by the ruling elite.

Voting is compulsory, making elections a powerful tool for the ruling Workers’ Party in checking up on the people.

For
 North Korean authorities, the elections provide both a veneer of 
democracy and a means of monitoring the whereabouts and loyalties of 
average citizens.

Colorful 
posters urging citizens to go to the polls line the streets in Pyongyang
 and other cities.

Along with nearly 700 other `deputies" expected to be
 seated in the new assembly, supreme leader Kim Jong-Un himself has 
announced his candidacy - in District 111 on sacred Mount Paekdu.
