Gus Poyet has asked for more time to stamp his own identity on the Sunderland side after insisting he was not to blame for the transfer strategy which left them short of defenders.

The Uruguayan is grateful not to have been fired in the wake of last weekend’s 8-0 drubbing at Southampton and the Black Cats take on Arsenal just one point outside of the bottom three.

Poyet marked one year in the job earlier this month but believes he is still some way from making the team his own.

‘It takes time, no doubt,’ he said. ‘Managers love to have time but it’s also unrealistic. We can’t always be asking for time.

‘Do I need time to change things? Yes, I do. The most difficult thing to change is mentality. A player at 27 or 28 isn’t going to improve his ability, but he might have been in a certain mental situation because every season involved in relegation. It takes time to change that and results. The two coming together, I hope I’ve got the time.’

Poyet says the loss at Southampton – which equalled a club record – was not helped by only having four fit defenders.

And the Sunderland boss does not take responsibility for the club’s failure to bring in the personnel he asked for during the summer.

‘I wanted seven defenders and we started the season with six,’ said Poyet, having this week signed former France defender Anthony Reveillere on a free transfer.

‘That’s true, but now we have seven. I didn’t make the decision to have six, but that’s life.

‘I accept it and I get on with it. Which means I’m not going to tell you I’m happy or not happy. Don’t say that. I’m okay. I get on with it because that is where we are.

‘We were looking for certain players, we were looking for Fabio Borini but he didn’t come. We signed Ricky Alvarez. But I’m not going to lie, we didn’t sign a replacement for Borini.’

Meanwhile, midfielder Lee Cattermole has revealed the desperation of the squad to put right the humiliation of last weekend.

‘I said to my girlfriend on Sunday morning, “I wish we had a game this afternoon to put it right”,’ he said.

‘You just need another game and we need everyone to pull together as a club. We know the supporters will back us. We let them down on Saturday but we are looking to bounce back and start repairing that damage.

‘What happened last week we’d like to think was a one-off. A lot of people are hurting. There has been a lot of discussion since then and this week has been difficult.

‘We finished the game on Saturday and didn’t meet up again until Monday. That 24 hours felt like a few days for most of us. We came back and had time to think about it, we put our point across where we thought we could improve.’
