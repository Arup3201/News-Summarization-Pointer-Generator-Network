A mother had to give her two-year-old son the kiss of life when he stopped breathing after mistaking nicotine replacement mints for sweets after an ambulance failed to turn up.

Kerry Brown, 27, feared she was going to lose her son, Max, when he collapsed at their home in Huntingdon, Cambridgeshire.

Max started vomiting violently after eating the mints containing the equivalent of up to 15 cigarettes-worth of nicotine.

However, despite dialling 999, paramedics failed to turn up and after 20 minutes Ms Brown was forced to step in when her son turned blue.

'Disgusted': Kerry Brown said she was forced to take action to save her son Max after they were left waiting more than 20 minutes for an ambulance

She contacted paramedics again but claims she was told that the ambulance would be there in another half an hour.

'I had to blow in his mouth to save his life,' said Ms Brown, who added that she was 'totally disgusted' with the ambulance service as a result of the ordeal on Sunday.

'If my son had died, I don't know what I would have done.'

The two-year-old had been watching television at his grandmother's house in Huntingdon when he swallowed the mints after finding them in her purse while his mother was out of the room.

Horrified Ms Brown dialled 999 when she returned to find Max holding the packet of NiQuitin Minis.

'All of a sudden he just went really pale, he had no life in him,' she said. He was going blue so we phoned an ambulance straight away.

'My brother phoned the ambulance and they said it was on its way,' said Ms Brown, who has another son and two daughters.

'Then Max got a lot worse so we phoned 20 minutes later and they said it would be here in half an hour.'

'Pale': Ms Brown, seen left with Max, said her son had thought the nicotineÂ  mints were sweets

Ms Brown's brother Lee McCool decided to rush his terrified sister and her son to Hinchingbrooke Hospital himself.

'We got him in the car and he was going in and out of consciousness,' said Ms Brown.

'Then he stopped breathing - I had to blow in his mouth to save his life.'

An East of England Ambulance Service spokesman said a rapid response vehicle was dispatched when Ms Brown dialled 999 and was on course to reach the scene within the 30 minute target time set for calls of that nature.

He said Ms Brown's son was conscious and breathing at the time of the call, which was logged as a 'category green two', - referring to an incident that is serious but not life-threatening.

When the family called a second time, the operator was informed they would be driving the toddler to hospital themselves, and the ambulance on its way to the house was called off.

'People must remember that 999 is designed to give life-threatened patients priority. This incident was correctly diagnosed through a thorough clinical call handling process as not life-threatening,' the ambulance service said.

Max, who was given emergency treatment and kept in hospital overnight, is now recovering at home with his mother.

But Ms Brown said: 'If something like this happened again I wouldn't phone an ambulance.'
