Strolling hand-in-hand on a summer’s afternoon, they look like a couple without a care in the world.

But this is the married co-founder of online fashion emporium ASOS, which counts the Duchess of Cambridge and Prime Minister’s wife Samantha Cameron as customers.

The woman by Nick Robertson’s side is his former PA Charlotte Balin – 15 years his junior – and together they have set up home just a short distance from his estranged wife.

It was announced in March that Mr Robertson, 46, one the UK’s richest men, had parted from Janine, his wife of ten years.

He was said to have left the £8.3 million six-bedroom property in Wimbledon, South-West London, that he shared with Mrs Robertson, 41, and their two daughters.

At the time, friends said the couple were living apart on civilised terms and were trying to make their marriage work. But now it has emerged that Mr Robertson is renting a five-bedroom house with Ms Balin, 31, in Wimbledon, close to his former family home.

It is understood that divorce proceedings have begun. She declined to comment when approached by The Mail on Sunday.

Earlier this year, it was suggested the couple had drifted apart because the tycoon had been travelling a lot due to work commitments.

But now a source has told The Mail on Sunday that Mrs Robertson is hurt, angry and feels betrayed by her husband.

‘The marriage only ended a few months ago and now Nick is moving into a property so close. They might as well have set up home at the bottom of the garden,’ a source said.

Mr Robertson founded ASOS – which stands for As Seen On Screen – with friend Quentin Griffiths in 2000. Specialising in clothing and accessories, it rapidly became a £2 billion global company.

The Duchess of Cambridge, Samantha Cameron and First Lady Michelle Obama have all worn ASOS’s own-label designs, helping the company to achieve annual sales of £770 million.

The great-grandson of retailer Austin Reed, Mr Robertson is said to be worth £448 million and his wife would be likely to get a large chunk of his fortune.

However, because most of his wealth is tied up in the business, there are fears that any divorce settlement that forces Mr Robertson to sell part of his 9.28 per cent stake in the business could rock its share price.

It would be the latest in a series of blows for the retailer, which has issued two profits warnings this year and suffered a suspected arson attack at its main distribution centre.

Its share price has dropped 65 per cent since March, wiping almost £4 billion off its value.

A spokesman for Mr Robertson and Miss Balin said Mr Robertson moved out of the family home last October but neither he nor Miss Balin wished to comment.
