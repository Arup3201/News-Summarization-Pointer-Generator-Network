A sergeant with the Detroit Police Department has been found wearing a dead victim's expensive watch several months after he was in charge of the man's murder investigation.

Homicide sergeant Alex Vinson has been suspended from his position and his department is now asking prosecutors to review the case to bring any potential charges.

Vinson was in charge of a case several months ago in which the unidentified victim's belongings included an expensive, German-made watch, Police Chief James Craig told the Detroit News.

The watch was photographed and placed with other evidence in the homicide unit's property room before the case went cold.

Caught: Sergeant Alex Vinson, who works for the Detroit Police Department, was found wearing the watch of a murder victim. He had presided over the case, which went cold, a few months ago, police said

But earlier this week, detectives decided to reopen the case and went to collect the evidence.

When they removed the watch, they realized that it did not match up with the item in the photograph and that it had been switched for a less-expensive one, police said.

An internal investigation was launched and the FBI helped the police track it down.

Vinson was attending advanced police training in Idaho at the time - and the police learned he was wearing the watch there, Craig said. 

Police Chief James Craig (pictured) said that the sergeant had been suspended and could face charges after he was found wearing a watch from a murder victim. It had been swapped for a cheaper version

He was ordered to return to Michigan and when he arrived on Wednesday, he was immediately suspended from his position. 

A  Detroit Police Department spokesperson said they would not be releasing any further information until Vinson is charged.

The District Attorney's office is currently looking over the case, she said.

The homicide case remains open but the victim has not been identified.
