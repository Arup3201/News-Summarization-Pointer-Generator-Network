Ancient human remains of what has been dubbed the 'oldest Parisian' have been uncovered in silts close to the River Seine in France.

Archaeologists unearthed 200,000-year-old left arm bones at Tourville-la-Rivière which are believed to belong to a young Neanderthal.

An unusual raised ridge on the upper-arm bone suggests that the Neanderthal suffered should muscle damage from repeatedly throwing a spear.

If this proves to be true, it could provide evidence that Neanderthals were capable of creating throwing spears, rather than simply using thrusting weapons to hunt.

'We have a particular morphology on the humerus where we have this very important crest that is related probably to a specific movement - a specific movement that has been repeated by this individual,' Dr Bruno Maureille a palaeontologist at the National Centre for Scientific Research told the BBC.

'Right at that point, we have a kind of micro-trauma, which could be related to a movement that is more difficult, and it has created this strange relief.'

The arm bones – a humerus, radius and ulna – were found by archaeologists from the French National Institute for Preventive Archaeological Research.

he unusual crest was revealed using computer tomography scans which found it may have been created by an injury to the deltoid muscle at the owner's shoulder. Pictured are CT-based 3D mapping of the thickness of the bones in the latest find

The interpretation that thrown spears were used 200,000 years ago in Europe is 'controversial' according to Brian Richmond, a curator at the American Museum of Natural History in New York speaking with Live Science.

But a separate study earlier this year uncovered 80,000-year-old spear tips which scientist believe were probably created by ancestors to ancient humans, rather than by our species.

Controversy surrounds the precise date that early man began to use stone-tipped spears - with some experts suggesting their use as far back as 500,000 years ago.

A separate study done in May by Corey O'Driscoll, of South East Archaeology in Canberra, Australia, Professor O'Driscoll shaped flint reproductions of spear and arrow points from the Middle Stone Age in Africa and attached them to wooden shafts.

Together with a group of University of Queensland students, O'Driscoll ran 15 experiments, throwing replica spears with bows or a calibrated crossbow at lamb and cow carcasses.

The results showed 'quite a difference between the butchering marks and projectile impact marks,' and revealed six types of distinctive projectile impact wounds, from drag marks to fracture marks and punctures.

These findings prompted O'Driscoll and the University of Queensland's Jessica Thompson to take a new look at three bone specimens from large unidentified mammals - a rib and two vertebrae - from Pinnacle Point Cave in South Africa.

Two dated to between 91,000 and 98,000 years ago and the third dated even earlier, between 153,000 and 174,000 years ago - making them, at the time, the oldest direct evidence of the use of projectile weapons.

This discovery means Homo heidelbergensis, an ancestor to both humans and Neanderthals, was much more technologically advanced than previously thought.

Homo sapiens then either developed the technology themselves, or learned it from Homo heidelbergensis, which helped them to move out of Africa and out-compete Neanderthals.

Researchers are now studying the stone javelin tips, recently found at an Ethiopian Stone Age site known as Gademotta.

Researchers made their find at Tourville-la-Rivière, roughly 100km from the French capital, Paris

Scientists the University of California at Berkeley's Human Evolution Research Center were recently able to study the spears and determine their age.

Writing in the journal Plos One, they claim the weapons were made from obsidian - a naturally occurring volcanic glass known for its high blast resistance and strength.

'[This] is significant because it provides direct evidence for a highly advantageous, complex technology that pre-dates the emergence of Homo sapiens,' said the authors of the study.

Researchers believe the direct ancestor of Homo sapiens in Africa, and Neanderthals in Europe and Asia, is the Homo heidelbergensis, also known as Heidelberg Man.

Previous evidence shows that Heidelberg Man was an accomplished tool-maker and skillfully butchered large animals.

However, the stone-tipped spears have provided a clearer understanding of the extent of this species skills.

The oldest known stone-tipped spears predate the earliest known human fossils by 85,000 years. This image shows a sample of Gademotta pointed artifacts exhibiting fractures indicative of weapons that would have been thrown
