Wisconsin Republican Governor Scott Walker sent a letter to a prominent Jewish attorney that was signed: 'Thank you and Molotov.'

'My guess is it was a typo,' Walker, who is considering running for president in 2016, said when asked about the slip-up at the governor's mansion on Wednesday. 

Walker presumably meant to write 'mazel tov' - a Jewish phrase to express congratulations and best wishes - when he sent the undated letter to prominent Milwaukee attorney Franklyn Gimbel.

The letter, sent when Walker was Milwaukee County executive, had long been forgotten but surfaced again when documents for John Doe investigations were released in August, the Cap Times reported. He said he suspects it was written around 2003.

Oops: Republican Governor Scott Walker, pictured speaking at the Republican Jewish Coalition in March, sent a letter to a Jewish attorney that was signed off: 'Thank you and Molotov' - instead of 'mazel tov'

Gaffe: Walker has since claimed that the slip up - which was at the end of a letter about placing a menorah at the Milwaukee County Courthouse - was probably just a typo. He thinks the letter is from around 2003

He was writing to Gimbel to say he would be happy to display a menorah celebrating 'The Eight Days of Chanukah' at the Milwaukee County Courthouse.

'He kinda missed the boat there,' Gimbel told the Milwaulkee Journal Sentinel. '"Molotov" is a far cry from "mazel tov".'

Recipient: He sent the letter to attorney Franklyn Gimbel, who called the error 'pretty basic'

Gimbel added that he can't recall the letter and likely stopped reading after seeing Walker had accepted the menorah proposal. If he had seen the mistake, he would have called him to point it out, he said.

'That's pretty basic,' Gimbel said. 

Walker, the son of a Baptist preacher and a practicing Christian, has been courting Jewish voters ahead of his potential bid for the presidency. 

Walker spoke at the Republican Jewish Coalition spring meeting this year and, in an attempt to woo the audience, mentioned that the governor's mansion has a 'menorah candle'.

He said on Wednesday that menorah is the same one that he displayed at the Milwaukee County courthouse following the request from Gimbel. 

In the speech, he also vaguely signaled his support for Israel and said that the name of his oldest son, Matthew, comes from the Hebrew word for 'gift from god'.

On Wednesday, Walker likened discussion of the 'Molotov' typo to discussion during his re-election campaign about why his thumb had a bandage on it and comments he made about his bald spot being caused by hitting his head on a cabinet.

'My thumb has healed up and my bald spot is boring now, and they have to talk about things like that,' he said.
