An online fundraiser for the family of a Pennsylvania woman allegedly killed by her stepfather last month has nearly reached its $15,000 goal, as prosecutors have revealed the shocking murder was motivated by the suspect's necrophilia.

Gregory Graf, 53, was arrested late last month and charged with shooting dead his newlywed stepdaughter, 33-year-old Jessica Padgett, who was last seen alive November 21.

Her body was discovered buried behind a shed on Graf's property five days later.

Kindness of strangers: As of Monday morning, the GoFundMe campaign was just $380 shy of its $15,000 goal

On Friday, it emerged that the suspected gunman videotaped himself sexually abusing the lifeless body of the 33-year-old mother of three.

Shauna Wilkins, a longtime friend of the victim's, launched a GoFundMe campaign a week and a half ago to provide financial assistance to Padgett's three young children, reported Leigh Valley Morning Call.

As of Monday morning, the fundraiser was just $380 short of its $15,000 goal thanks to the generosity of nearly 340 Good Samaritans.

Padgett's widower, Mica, and his mother are the only people who will be able to use the collected donations, which will help cover the grieving family’s basic living expenses.

Padgett's sister, Kristi Davis, wrote a message on her Facebook page last week thanking the community for their generosity and kindness.

'I don't want my brother in law to have to worry an ounce about the mortgage or putting food on the table until he can heal and get back to work. Thank you again!' she wrote November 30.

Miss Davis took to the fundraising page last week to once again express her gratitude for the outpouring of support.

'Wow.. I'm just speechless. You all are amazing and Jessica is smiling down on all of you for helping to take care of her precious babies,' Padgett's sister posted. 

Alleged necrophiliac: Gregory Graf recorded himself sexually abusing the body of Jessica Padgett, Northampton County District Attorney John Morganelli said on Friday

Discovered: Graf was arrested five days later after police found Padgett's buried behind a shed on the property where he lives with Padgett's mother

Hunter: Gregory Graf's Facebook is filled with photos of him along with animals he's hunted 

On Friday, Northampton County District Attorney John Morganelli said investigators have discovered a video on Gregory Graf's computer showing the 53-year-old sexually abusing Jessica Padgett's corpse.

Padgett, 33, was last seen alive November 21, when she left work at a day care center. Graf was arrested five days later after police found her body outside the home where he lives with Padgett's mother.

Graf, 53, is being held without bail on a homicide charge. The fencing company owner confessed to killing Padgett, a recently married mother of three, according to Morganelli.

The victim's family said in a statement last month that Padgett 'was a beautiful, vibrant young woman who was beloved by her family and friends. The world shines less bright today.'

Graf applied for a public defender, saying in court Friday that he didn't want to burden his family financially. A judge turned him down, ruling he had enough money to pay for his own defense.

'Like I said, I just don't want to take away the funds from the family,' said Graf, the owner of a fencing company.

'You're not going to be able to escape paying for the resources of an attorney,' Judge Stephen Baratta told Graf

'I just can't allow that.'

Morganelli said Graf will be charged with abuse of a corpse.

So happy together: The raised funds will be made available to Jessica's (far right) newlywed husband, Mica (top left). Pictured here are the happy couple with their friends, Shauna and Jim Wilkins

Killed: Padgett,  a 33-year-old mother of three, was last seen alive on November 21, when she left work at a day care center and her dead body was found in a shed five days later 

'He videotaped it,' Morganelli told Philly.com.

'So there's a videotape of him abusing the corpse sexually.'

Morganelli said he believes that Graf took his stepdaughter's life in order to abuse her as a corpse.

'I believe it was a direct motive, in my opinion,' Morganelli said, 'and that's what we're going to be arguing.'

Because the alleged abuse occurred after Padgett was killed Morganelli will not be able to seek the death penalty.

Philly.com reports that under Pennsylvania law Rape and murder allow prosecutors to purse capital charges but sexual desecration of a corpse does not.

Padgett went missing that day after she left Duck Duck Goose Child Care in Northampton and she never returned to her job there.

Police say that the shooting happened around 10 minutes after she was last seen, though her body wasn't recovered until five days later.

Morganelli has said Graf also had a marijuana-growing space at his house that was discovered by police as they searched for Padgett.

Police seized 13 bags of marijuana and also confiscated $42,000 in cash and envelopes containing marijuana seeds from in a safe in the basement of Graf's home. \

Graf's Facebook account indicates he has a love of hunting animals and has killed quite a few. 

Loved:  The victim's family said in a statement last month that Padgett 'was a beautiful, vibrant young woman who was beloved by her family and friends. The world shines less bright today'

Family: Jessica Padgett was married and had three children and also worked with children at a childcare center 

Confessed: Gregory Graf confessed to killing Padgett and said he did it because he wanted to have sex with her and that he did so after she was dead
