A pervert who grabbed a young student in a subway station got more than he bargained for when she refused to stand for it and started smacking him about the head.

Shyane DeJesus, 22, who lives in Queens, New York was on her way to work at a shoe shop shortly before 10am on October 23 when the attack took place.

She was looking down the tracks on the platform at Union Square subway station in Manhattan to see if a train was coming, when the man sidled up to her and began rubbing himself on her thigh.

An the train was approaching, the man 'grabbed my right shoulder and pushed my head down and lifted my skirt up and groped me,' she said.

'He went on the train and sat down as if nothing had happened.'

No one came to help her so the anthropology major defended herself, repeatedly hitting him over the head and then pushing her cameraphone in his face to snap a picture, screaming at him: 'Don't you ever!'

Miss DeJesus, who attends City College, told the New York Post: 'It was disgusting. I felt so violated. I’m glad I fought back. I’m going to defend myself.

'I yelled that he just groped me. I literally started punching him in the head.'

'I held the door and positioned the phone
in his face. He smirked when I looked at him. He never said a word, not a
word. All I got was that smirk.'

The student added that she hoped the picture will help police catch her attacker.

A police source told MailOnline today: 'The investigation is still continuing.'

According to a report by the NYPD, subway crime increased by 16.6 per cent last year.
