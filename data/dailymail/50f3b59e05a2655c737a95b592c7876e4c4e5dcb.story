A chief constable has sparked a furious debate by saying police should not have to deal with every missing person report or tackle drunk and violent patients in A&E.

Lynne Owens, Chief Constable of Surrey, called on hospitals and care homes to tackle problems themselves rather than calling 999.

She also said officers should not have to spend hours dealing with those threatening suicide simply because there is no separate emergency service for people suffering a mental health crisis.

And she blasted shops and petrol stations for lax security that allows thieves to get away.

Appeal: Chief Constable Lynne Owens sparked a furious debate by saying police should not have to deal with every missing person report or tackle drunk and violent patients in A&E

In an interview with The Mail on Sunday, Mrs Owens said the burden placed on police by other organisations prevents them fighting growing crimes such as online fraud and child abuse.

As forces struggle to cope with ongoing budget cuts, she called on the public to say what they expect of slimmed-down forces. ‘It’s inevitable that the cuts will have operational consequences,’ she said.

The police have had a 20 per cent budget reduction since the last Election in May 2010, leading to the loss of 15,000 frontline officers and the closure of stations.

But Mrs Owens – a former Met Assistant Commissioner who was in charge of security for Prince William and Kate Middleton’s wedding – said that as the cuts bite, some types of crime are on the rise.

She said public-sector bodies and private firms must stop relying so much on the police. ‘We are going to be smaller, and there are some areas where we need to grow, such as our response to dealing with paedophiles and online fraud,’ she said. ‘We are going to have to make choices in other areas. And it does mean we need other sectors to be held accountable for their core responsibilities.’

There had been a ‘huge increase’ in missing person reports, she said. In Surrey they rose from 1,158 to 1,648 in the past year. Some involved vulnerable children or elderly people with dementia, and a few would end up as murder inquiries.

She called on hospitals and care homes to tackle problems like drunks  themselves rather than calling 999 

Mrs Owens said: ‘Hospitals, care homes and other agencies report people missing and there are questions about whether they should do more themselves before they call the police. She said hospitals were the most frequent callers to Surrey Police, followed by the ambulance service, usually reporting ‘violent people, drunk people or missing people’. But she said all these could be handled by in-house security.

The College of Policing, the new professional body for the service, is looking nationally at the demands placed on police by other public-sector bodies.

Its research is expected to show that some officers are spending up to eight hours with people suffering mental health problems while doctors assess them, and three-quarters of those taken to ‘places of safety’ are driven by police rather than paramedics.

Mrs Owens, who spent New Year’s Eve on the front line with her officers, said that a fifth of calls that night were either people threatening to kill themselves or from worried relatives.

She said: ‘The ambulance service is established to deal with physical health issues but there is no one agency that can respond to people with mental health issues.’

Mrs Owens is also against police locking up drunks, because it takes officers off the street to keep watch over them.

She said: ‘I think there should be some funding from the licensing community, which makes huge profits from people who drink alcohol.’

She criticised shops for not investing enough in security to ‘design out crime’. And she thinks motorists should have to pay for petrol before filling up, so police do not have to chase those who drive off.

Surrey Police have faced criticism for some of their spending, however. They spent £14 million over six years developing an IT system for criminal intelligence – then scrapped it.
