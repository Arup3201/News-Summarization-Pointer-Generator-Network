Chris Jordan’s five for 29 in England’s 10-wicket victory against Sri Lanka on Wednesday is only the latest remarkable chapter in the story of an emerging talent that has seen Alec Stewart liken him to Malcolm Marshall.

While it may have been the dream of playing in West Indian maroon that first inspired Jordan as he grew up in Bridgetown, Barbados, it is now the lure of Lord’s that is calling.

Jordan was introduced to the game by his father, Robert, and would spend ‘special’ summer days watching the West Indies at the island’s Kensington Oval. His sister Keisha played hockey for Barbados but cricket was Jordan’s passion. He tried to emulate Courtney Walsh and Curtly Ambrose as a skinny child playing joyfully on the outfield during the lunch breaks and fondly recalls delivering throw-downs to Brian Lara.

Jordan attended Charles F Broome primary school and then Combermere High with the pop star Rihanna, but a Pro-Am cricket festival set his life on a completely different track.

He happened to play in a team captained by former England batsman Bill Athey, who recognised his talent and selected him as only the second young Caribbean cricketer to profit from a scholarship programme at Dulwich College, a prestigious independent school in south-east London.

Jordan’s mother Rosita, a secretary at a Bajan bank, had grown up in south London. Her son, a British passport holder, duly retraced his family roots 4,000 miles away in England’s capital, spending a year at the boarding school in 2006-7 before settling in the city.

‘It was a huge step for a boy, coming from Barbados to a big private school in London but he did it,’ said Athey. ‘He’s a personable lad and he played football for the school as well, so he was well in with the other boys straight away. It was easy to see his talent but our scholarship students have to be academically strong as well, which Chris was. He could bat, bowl and field well in the deep or close to the wicket. There are very few with that genuine all-round ability.’

Jordan’s talent soon attracted the attention of Surrey, too. Nadeem Shahid was the club’s 2nd XI coach and went to watch Jordan at Athey’s invitation.

‘I thought: “Crikey, this kid is pretty special”,’ said Shahid. ‘He was so raw. He’d run in really hard from this long run-up and he could bowl very fast. When batting he could hit the ball hard but he wasn’t quite the finished article.’

Jordan’s rawness, however, was what made him so special in Shahid’s eyes. Pictures of him as a teenager reveal a baby-faced assassin and he played with a freedom and a childlike enjoyment that, thankfully, had not been coached out of him at an early age. His potential was evident for all to see.

‘I invited him for a 2nd team net and he impressed again, so we picked him in a 2nd XI game,’ added Shahid. ‘He took three or four wickets and scored about 20 runs so I called up Alan Butcher (then Surrey’s 1st XI coach) and said: “You really have to have a look at this kid”. He was in the 1st XI nets the next morning.

‘Chris was such a nice kid, always well-behaved and very respectful of his elders. We had a tour in  Barbados and he showed us all around. He was so well-mannered, even if he was full-on on the pitch.

‘Chris was one of those kids that make you think: “I’m so glad he’s made it”.’

Former England captain Stewart was another impressed by Jordan’s natural ability, even if ‘CJ’ is a Manchester United supporter who took a lot of stick from this staunch Chelsea fan.

‘CJ was the best young talent I had seen since Graham Thorpe,’ Stewart told Sportsmail. ‘They are very different cricketers, but you could just tell Chris was going to be a superstar. He made everything look so easy.

‘It’s a big shout but I likened him to a young, poor man’s Malcolm Marshall, who was the greatest bowler I ever played against.

‘I’m not saying CJ will get that close but he’s a quick bowler who can swing the ball out and a fine fielder as well — a very good slip with a good head on his young shoulders.’

Former West Indies captain Sir Clive Lloyd was also struck by Jordan’s talent during a match at The Oval in 2007. When he realised the fast bowler was Barbados-born, he asked Mark Butcher for Jordan’s telephone number, only to be referred to the Surrey captain’s father, who duly stalled and tried to put Lloyd off.

Undeterred,
 Lloyd asked after Jordan again when he saw Alan Butcher at a function 
that winter, but was told: ‘Sorry, Clive, too late. We’ve nicked him!’

Jordan
 seized his opportunity in England by joining Surrey aged 17 but, six 
years, 1,044 runs and 97 wickets later he was released by the county 
side. A once-promising career looked as if it might remain unfulfilled 
after Jordan missed the whole of the 2010 season with a ‘horrific’ back 
injury and then struggled to adjust his bowling action.

Richard Thompson, chairman of Surrey, said: ‘Chris was given plenty of exposure to the first team and he was well thought of but, when he was with us, he suffered a horrific back injury - a stress  fracture - which ruled him out for the whole of 2010.

‘Every man and his dog had a go at diagnosing the problem. When he came back he had to remodel his bowling action and it took time for him to find his rhythm.

‘It didn’t work for him and he needed a change of environment. He left in 2012 after six years with us and he went to Sussex where Mark Robinson has done a brilliant job with him.

‘There is no side to Chris, no edge. Now he has made a huge impact with England and it is  wonderful to see.’

Stewart also speaks of Jordan with considerable fondness, backing him to become a mainstay of the England Twenty20, one-day and Test teams, even if he is no longer wearing Surrey colours domestically.

He added: 
‘CJ had some injuries which may not have been diagnosed straightaway and
 then, later on in his Surrey career, his statistics didn’t back up his 
talent when he did get an opportunity. But I still believed he was going
 to be a top-class cricketer.

‘I
 rang Mark Robinson at Sussex and Martyn Moxon at Yorkshire and said: 
“He’s something very, very special. Take him on board because I still 
believe in him”.

‘People are allowed time to mature and you should always judge people in adversity. When you have little setbacks the great ones come through stronger. I’m very, very pleased to see what he’s achieved.’

Former Australia fast bowler Brett Lee noted Jordan’s ‘serious raw pace’ and predicted he is ‘destined to get a lot of wickets’ after watching him perform in Brisbane earlier this year. It was a one-day match that featured Jordan’s stunning catch off his own bowling to take the wicket of David Warner.

England bowling coach David Saker has also heralded Jordan as the ‘ultimate professional’, while captain Alastair Cook has been impressed by the way the 6ft 2in bowler has taken everything in his stride.

There is a sense of desperation to find an instant hero at a time of flux in English cricket, but Jordan’s performances so far this summer have suggested this very raw talent can step up and roar for years to come.

‘What I like about him is his  attitude,’ said Cook. ‘He hasn’t changed at all since the first day he walked into the changing room. He’s desperate to do well, and he’s got a hell of a lot of talent as well.’.
