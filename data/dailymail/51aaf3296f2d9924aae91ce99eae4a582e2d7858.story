A teacher who was caught having sex with a 15-year-old male student has pleaded guilty to all charges.

Kathryn Camille Murray, from Houston, Texas, pleaded guilty to one count of improper relations with a student and one count of sexual assault of a child. Two other charges against the 29-year-old were dropped.

Murray, who taught the eighth grade, was arrested in February 2012 after the teen's brother caught them having sex and investigators learned that she had sex multiple times with the victim whom she was supposed to be tutoring.

Murray will be sentenced on January 31, 2014.

Murray was fired from her job at Memorial Middle School as a language arts teacher before it emerged she also had sex with the boy in her classroom.

The disgraced teacher had sex with the boy at his home in February 2012, while his parents were away.

In a third incident, Murray left a school dance with the student and took him to a hotel room to have sex.

She was ordered to stay away from the student but in January this year was charged with harboring a runaway when police found the boy with the ex-teacher at her father's home.

They caught the 16-year-old trying to leave by the back door, according to KHOU.com

The school district wants the teacher punished while the teenager's parents said that he is the victim of the situation and had professed his love for the disgraced educator.
