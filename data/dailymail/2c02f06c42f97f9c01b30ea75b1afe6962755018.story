Liverpool players took part in their first pre-season training session of the summer on Monday as new signing Emre Can took to the Melwood training pitches for the first time.

With the likes of Steven Gerrard and Daniel Sturridge still resting after England's disappointing World Cup campaign, those who didn't travel to Brazil were back in action.

Liverpool boss Brendan Rodgers oversaw the session which also included Martin Skrtel, Philippe Coutinho and Jose Enrique.

Rodgers will be hoping his Liverpool side can build on an impressive 2013/14 season after finishing in second-place and securing Champions League football for next season.

Meanwhile, the likes of Gerrard and Lambert were making the most of some last minute rays on holiday.
