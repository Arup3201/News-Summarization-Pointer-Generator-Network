A campaign to drive anti-gay abuse out of football was last night demanded by the Lib Dems.

They marked the start of the new Premier League season by calling for homophobia to be tackled with the ‘same vigour’ as racism.

Stephen Williams, the Lib Dem Communities Minister, called on club stewards and police to have ‘zero tolerance’ of anti-gay abuse at games.

Mr Williams, the party’s first openly gay MP, said: ‘It isn’t acceptable that footballers still feel the need to hide their sexuality out of fear of abuse.

‘I want homophobia to be treated with zero tolerance, just the same as racism, and I want clubs, stewards, the police and the FA to work even harder to achieve this.’

A Lib Dem spokesman last night said: ‘The powers are already there. This doesn’t need fresh legislation – what it needs is a change of emphasis.’

He also acknowledged that clubs had made ‘significant progress’ in tackling homophobia, backed by campaigns such as Kick It Out, which encourage clubs to be more inclusive.
