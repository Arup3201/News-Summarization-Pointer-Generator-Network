A convention centre, sports stadium and performing arts complex are among the landmark projects planned for a new-look Christchurch after the city was levelled by an earthquake last year.

Essentially given a blank slate, government planners today unveiled a blueprint for New Zealand's oldest city that replaces office towers with green spaces, urban apartments and innovation 'hubs'.

Under the plan, which is hoped will give the city the feel of a college campus, its area will be smaller, with new buildings lower in height and built with better earthquake protection.

It is nearly 18 months since the magnitude-6.1 earthquake struck, killing 185 people and irreparably damaging 1,400 buildings, including the century-old Anglican cathedral in the city centre.

'It will be safe, modern, green and will leave a legacy that makes Christchurch one of the best places in the world to live and work for many generations to come,' said the city's mayor, Bob Parker.

The plan has been eagerly awaited, with many residents becoming frustrated at the slow pace of recovery.

Hundreds of substantial aftershocks have hampered progress and made insurers wary, while government and city officials, including Mayor Parker, have been accused of dithering and bickering.

Even before the plan was released, some wondered if they would end up footing a chunk of the bill through rate hikes.

Yet for many, the plan is a welcome step forward. Some see it as a unique chance to correct problems in the city, such as an excess of older-style office space that was evident even before the earthquake.

The plan also comes as the aftershocks appear to be finally abating.

However, New Zealand government officials have not yet identified an overall cost for the rebuild or specific funding sources for all the new projects.

Nick Bryant, a spokesman for earthquake recovery minister Gerry Brownlee, said that funding will come from a variety of sources, including local councils, private investors, insurance payouts and from the central government, which has so far set aside 5.5billion New Zealand dollars (£2.8billion) for the recovery efforts.

Under the plan, the city would be bordered with green spaces and the overall design would give more emphasis to the winding Avon River. An earthquake memorial would be given prominence, as would a Maori cultural centre. The central city square would be divided into a number of smaller public gathering spots.

The city would be broken into a series of hubs featuring related activities. For instance, there would be a health precinct anchored by a hospital, a justice precinct with courts and a police station, and a retail precinct with shops.

The plan identifies sites for big infrastructure projects including a prominent library and a convention centre with the capacity to hold 2,000 people that would overlook the river.

There would also be a covered sports stadium seating up to 35,000 people built in the city's south-east and an indoor aquatic and recreation centre built in the south-west.

New Zealand Prime Minister John Key, who grew up in Christchurch, said it was important to identify sites for the major new projects so that private developers could begin planning hotels, restaurants and shopping areas to complement them.

'I am delighted to see this plan for new development and to know that construction will soon be underway to rebuild my old hometown,' he said.
