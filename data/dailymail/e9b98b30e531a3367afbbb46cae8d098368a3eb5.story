An adorable four-year-old boy who lost both legs in a car accident has become an internet sensation after a video appeared online showing him dancing to a popular Chinese song. 

The little boy, called Xiaofeng, had both of his legs amputated two years ago and was filmed last week in his hospital bed joyfully bouncing around to hit song Little Apple.

Balancing himself on just his arms, Xiaofeng looks ecstatic as the nurses sing along to the catchy tune in the background.

The toddler, from Hubei in Eastern China, flips himself over onto his back, waves his arms in the air and wiggles his bum in time to the music. 

Xiaofeng manages to use the stumps of his legs to shimmy up and down the bed, laughing as the nurses clap and encourage the cute boy to continue.

His energetic dance routine lasts for over a minute-and-a-half before the cute boy gives up and lands on his face on the bed, clearly out of breath.

Little Apple or Xiao Ping Guo is a catchy song which has blown up in China since it was released in May. The song, composed to a 1980s disco beat has been reworked by the Chopsticks Brothers and has taken over the Chinese music scene.

Speaking to Sina.com, Xiaofeng's mother claims his love of dancing was always strong and his accident, in which he was run over by a car, didn't quench it. 

'Xiao Feng has always had a strong sense of rhythm and would dance to music,' his mother Zhang Xiyu said.

Xiaofeng has made a good recovery from the catastrophic accident and a donation drive has raised $103,301 (500,000 yuan) since Wednesday. It is believed the money came from just over 10,000 donors from around China

'Even though he doesn't have legs now, he still loves to prance around and create his own dance moves.' 

Xiaofeng has made a good recovery from the catastrophic accident and a donation drive has raised $103,301 (500,000 yuan) since Wednesday. It is believed the money came from just over 10,000 donors from around China.

The funds will reportedly go to Xiaofeng's impoverished family, who owe  150,000 yuan ($30,990) as a result of Xiaofeng's medical bills. 

On Wednesday, the little dance star's ultimate wish to fly came true after a Chinese airline made Xiaofeng a 'little pilot' for the day, letting him take the reigns and take a tour of the plane and cockpit with his parents at Tianhe airport in Wuhan, Hubei province.
