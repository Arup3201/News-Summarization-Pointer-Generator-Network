David Mather, 52, has been arrested in Spain. He was convicted in his absence in January last year at Sheffield Crown Court and was sentenced to 18 years in jail

A British drugs baron sentenced to 18 years in jail for his role in smuggling heroin into the UK has been arrested by armed officers in Spain.

David Mather, 52, from Salford, Greater Manchester, will now be extradited back to the UK where he will serve his sentence for conspiracy to import heroin.

Armed officers for the National Crime Agency (NCA) - dubbed the British FBI - and the Spanish National Police halted Mather as he drove through La Linea, close to the border with Gibraltar.

He was convicted in his absence in January last year at Sheffield Crown Court and was sentenced to 18 years in jail.

His arrest comes as part of Operation Captura Unlucky 13, a campaign to track down convicted criminals who have fled abroad to avoid justice.

Hank Cole, head of international operations for the NCA, said: 'This arrest is a result of close working with the Spanish authorities.

'Mather was using false identity documents to try and evade capture but we were able to track him down.

'It demonstrates the NCA and its partners have the capability to pursue fugitives wherever they are in the world.'

Lord Ashcroft, founder and chairman of Crimestoppers, said: 'The charity is obviously delighted by this latest arrest as this is the second Operation Captura subject to have been located since the turn of the year, which is a great result.

'David Mather has been convicted in his absence and will now have to come back to the UK to serve his sentence.

'We hope that this arrest will once again highlight that Crimestoppers, the NCA and our colleagues in Spain will not rest until wanted individuals are caught and brought to justice.'

A freight company owned by Mather was involved in the logistics and movement of a lorry that was stopped at Humber Sea Terminal in May 2010 with 32 wrapped packages of heroin found in the bumper.

It is believed the vehicle had been used on a number of occasions to import similar amounts of drugs into the UK.

Mather's picture was released in November last year as part of a list of 13 of Britain's most wanted criminals thought to be hiding in Spain.

The list was published as part of Operation Captura, a scheme to trace criminals who are thought to have fled to Spain.

Mather’s arrest means 58 out of 76 wanted individuals targeted since Operation Captura was launched have been caught.

The National Crime Agency was founded in October 2013 and employs roughly 4,000 officers to tackle serious and organised crime.
