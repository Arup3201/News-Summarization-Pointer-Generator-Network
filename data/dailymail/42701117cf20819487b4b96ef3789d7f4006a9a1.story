The son of a British submariner who died in 1933 has claimed Chinese authorities dug up his father's grave and used the headstone for building walls.

Charles Sells Jr, from Plymouth, is demanding to know what has become of his father's remains after learning the former graveyard in Weihaiwei, north of Shandong province, has become nothing but an overgrown corner of a Chinese naval facility.

His father, Charles Sells Sr,  was buried at the site which sat on British-leased land alongside dozens of military personnel who died aboard navy vessels.

The headstone of Charles Sells Sr has been removed by Chinese authorities from a graveyard in Shangdong and used to build walls, his son, Charles Sells Jr (right) has claimed

His son is now calling for a full account of what happened to the former servicemen and their graves.

'These people want an explanation or an apology and I support them. 
After all is said and done it is British military personnel who died 
there.'

The Petty Officer was on board HMS Proteus when he was crushed to death by a torpedo against the submarine's bulkhead

The news was brought to Mr Sells attention when a British television crew travelled to Shangdong last year to film a documentary, but found there were no headstones at the site when they arrived.

'If there was a memorial for Naval and military personnel who died over there I think that would be nice.

'I thought people in this area should be aware of the situation in 
China - I can't be alone in having someone whose remains are out there.

'Some of the crew members who died may have relatives in Plymouth.

'I would like to know what has happened to my father's remains, the 81-year-old added.

Mr Sells never met his father who was a Petty Officer on HMS Proteus when he was crushed to death after one of the submarine's torpedos slammed his body against the bulkhead.

The weapon was being loaded on to the submarine using a new type of strapping which snapped, causing the fatal accident.

The scandal surrounding the graveyard -
which was seized back by Chinese forces during the Communist revolution
- comes four years after it was revealed Chinese authorities had raised
the  HMS Poseidon.

It is thought some of the 21 British servicemen who died when the vessel sank were also buried at the cemetery.

Secretary of the Royal Naval 
Association in Plymouth, Arthur Gutteridge, said: 'I wasn't a submariner
but I'm sure all submariners throughout the Royal Navy will be totally 
disappointed.

'It's completely out of order. 

'It's sacrilege and bad news. It's a question of who is telling the truth.

'The fact is headstones won't be lying on the ground if there wasn't anything underneath them.

The graveyard's sat on land that had been leased by British authorities but was reclaimed during the Communist revolution

'Chinese
culture is different to us in the West, but I thought everybody across 
the world has the same respect for military graves.

'It is disappointing news.'

A spokesman for the Commonwealth War Graves Commission said the site was declared 'unmaintainable' in the 1930s.

HMS Proteus was the longest surviving Parthian-class submarine and the only one of its kind to survive the war

Charles Sells Jr was never able to meet his father who died at the age of 36. The 81-year-old is calling for a full account of what happened to his father's remains

Following the cultural revolution in China it 'simply wasn't possible for the Commonwealth War Graves Commission to get into the country, and a decision was made to do an alternative commemoration in Hong Kong,' he added. 

The Royal Navy had a large presence in China from the late 1800s to the 20th century.

The city of Weihaiwei was part of the British leased territory known as the Weihai Garrison, and was a regular port of call for Royal Navy ships and submarines.

HMS Proteus was the longest surviving Parthian-class submarine and the only one of its kind to survive the war.
