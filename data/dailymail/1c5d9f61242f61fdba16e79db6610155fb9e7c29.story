Hull City will spend the money received for Ireland striker Shane Long on a replacement and already have names in mind, according to manager Steve Bruce.

Despite only joining the Tigers in January, Long joined Southampton on Thursday for a fee reported to be around £12million.

'We got what, in our opinion, was a fabulous offer,' said Bruce. 'It happened so quickly. This time last week I would never have envisaged us being without him.'

Defiant: Hull will invest Shane Long's transfer fee back into the squad, insists Steve Bruce

In action: Long played in both legs of Hull's recent Europa League tie against ASTrencin

Long played in both of Hull's Europa League qualifying matches this season and now the FA Cup finalists have promised to use the funds received from Southampton to strengthen their squad.

'We will invest that money into the squad to make it bigger and better, and we'll be looking to find a replacement,' Bruce added.

Names: Bruce insists that the money will be spent, and that he already has a few players in mind

'We've got irons in the fire. I'd like at least another three players to come through the door. The money that we got for Shane will allow us to do that.'

Hull begin their Premier League campaign away to newly promoted Queens Park Rangers on Saturday.
