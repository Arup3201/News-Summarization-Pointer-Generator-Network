Bats are often associated with vampires, caves and other dark, creepy or dingy imagery.

But this adorable little fruit bat wolfing down a banana is bound to change your perception.

Filmed by Denise, a lady who rescues and cares for fruit bats, the video shows a much sweeter side of what is usually considered a rather spooky animal. 

Hungry fellow: The tiny fruit bat calms down completely when it spies a banana

The bat appears to pull hilarious facial expressions as it tucks into the fruit snack

Munching on the banana, the wide-eyed bat looks extremely excited as it fills its mouth before lifting its head back in satisfaction.

Going in for another bite with even more enthusiasm, the bat opens its mouth as wide as it can and stuffs its face once more.

Looking at the camera while it finishes its mouthful, the bat takes one last big bite of the banana and uses its pointed tongue to help shovel down the food.

Before lifting its head one last time as if completely full and entirely satisfied.

According to Storyful, an abundance of rainfall in Brisbane, Australia in recent weeks has resulted in food supplies becoming scarce - as a result, this bat was rescued by a lady called Nanette.

At one point the bat is even seen poking its tongue out as it makes sure it has eaten every last morsel

Denise is among the people rescuing the bats from fruit netting during the poor weather.

Referencing the video, Denise said the fruit bat was initially a little feisty until it spied the banana.

After that he was happy once and began stuffing his face with the food – as is seen in the video. 

There's no need to be scared of these bats judging by the adorable rescue animal at Denise's shelter

Denise told MailOnline: 'Rain is good news for the coming winter but it's not such good news for hungry bat bellies. 

'Although there is a magnificent array of native flowering occurring, rain washes the nectar and pollen out of the blossom and flying-foxes are forced to seek sustenance elsewhere. 

'As a result we get an increased number of calls for bats trapped in large aperture fruit tree netting during and after rain events.'

Denise added: 'Please net, grow and harvest sustainably. Never use any netting you can poke your finger through and use shadecloth or a similar weave to protect your fruit. Even better still, take what you need and share the rest with our wildlife.'
