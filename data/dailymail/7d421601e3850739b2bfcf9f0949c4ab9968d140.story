Switzerland is placing a ban on the number of EU citizens - including Britons - who can work in the country as public anger grows over mass immigration.

From next week the Alpine state will implement quotas on work permits for jobseekers from the European Union. The limits will be in place for the next 12 months.

The Swiss government fears being 'swamped' by economic refugees from Bulgaria and Romania when work rules are eased next year.

But it cannot discriminate against only a few countries out of a bloc of 27 with 500million citizens so the restrictions will affect everyone.

The Swiss parliament has decided to restrict access to work in the country to people from EU member states

'In the coming 12 months, workers from EU states will have only restricted access to the Swiss labour market,' the Swiss Federal Council said in a statement.

The move by Switzerland comes ahead of a significant change to the rights of Romanians
 and Bulgarians to work.

Romania and Bulgaria are among the poorest countries in Europe and when they joined the European Union in 2007 work restrictions were imposed amid fears about mass migration.

These measures will be dropped on 1 January 2014 giving Bulgarians and Romanians the same rights to work across the union as other EU citizens.

From January 1 next year, the 25,000 
cap on the number of low-skilled workers from the two countries who can 
get jobs and claim benefits in Britain will expire.

The move by Switzerland to limit EU 
citizens from working comes ahead of a change to the number of Romanians
 and Bulgarians who can come to the UK.

EU-wide work restrictions were imposed on the two countries when they joined the union in 2007.

There were fears that mass immigration would swamp other EU countries as people left their home countries - among the poorest in Europe - to seek work elsewhere.

From January 1 next year, the restrictions are lifted.

In the UK, this means the 25,000 
cap on the number of low-skilled workers from the two countries who can 
get jobs and claim benefits here will expire.

The minimum wage in Bulgaria is only 73p while it stands at 79p in Romania. In Britain the minimum wage is £6.19, rising to £6.31 from October.

There are about 130,000 Romanian and Bulgarians living in the UK.

Current rules mean they are only 
allowed to work here if they are self-employed, investors, or if they 
take on short-term contracts for jobs such as fruit picking. 

Switzerland's move will increase pressure for other nations to follow suit.

But local media have called the decision a
 'pulling up the drawbridge' mentality and came after pressure from 
right-wing parties, despite pleas by the influential Swiss financial 
sector that more immigrants are needed to keep the economy strong.

In recent years the subject of immigration has become ever more controversial.

Right-wing parties have routinely 
played on Swiss fears of 'the other' and issued posters like one which 
showed a black sheep being kicked out of a field full of white ones.

The far-right Swiss People's Party in particular has spiked in popularity with claims that foreigners take jobs away from Swiss citizens.

But in reality it is immigration from only a few states - Portugal, Spain, Greece and now Romania and Bulgaria - that irritates the most.

Southern European people have been flocking to Switzerland in recent times as the endless financial crisis continues to sap them of jobs and hope.

The clause that Switzerland is invoking is part of a bilateral agreement on migration with the European Union and allows temporary quotas on residency permits for EU residents wishing to work in Switzerland.

Switzerland will now apply to the entire EU limits already in place for people from Estonia, Hungary, Lithuania, Latvia, Poland, Slovakia, Slovenia and the Czech Republic.

'Despite the move the EU is and will remain our most important partner,' said Justice Minister Simonetta Sommaruga.

A government spokesman said that the million-plus EU residents who live in the country have 'had a positive impact... in particular in terms of consumer spending and on the construction industry,' but that restrictions are 'needed to make immigration more acceptable to society.'

The move drew immediate criticism from Brussels.

''The measures disregard the great benefits that the free movement of persons brings to the citizens of both Switzerland and the EU,' said Baroness Catherine Ashton, EU foreign policy chief.

Others worry that the Swiss move is a new manifestation of intolerance in Europe.
