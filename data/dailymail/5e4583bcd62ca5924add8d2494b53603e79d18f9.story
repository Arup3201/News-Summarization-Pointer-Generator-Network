Tommy Wright insisted that Dundee United rival Jackie McNamara will not risk fielding wonderkids Ryan Gauld and John Souttar in Saturday’s William Hill Scottish Cup Final.

Wright started the cup final mind games by boldly predicting how United will line up and combating claims his St Johnstone side are the more experienced team.

Gauld and Souttar have earned rave reviews this season - and plenty of transfer attention - but Wright argued neither youngster has performed well when facing his St Johnstone side.

‘Dundee United have got experience. In Gavin Gunning, John Rankin, Sean Dillon, Paul Paton,’ Wright said. ‘He (Jackie) won’t play his young players. John Souttar and Ryan Gauld won’t play. Andrew Robertson will be the only player without a lot of experience in his team. 

‘Gary Mackay-Steven has a lot of experience and so does Stuart Armstrong.

‘So I don’t buy into that “young and inexperienced” stuff. They’ve got a good team of players who have got experience in the league and we think we’ve got experience and a blend of youth as well that we can call upon.’

Wright is comfortable his team are the underdogs – despite beating their Tayside rivals three times this season in the league.

Some of United’s younger players have been outmuscled in those defeats, prompting Wright to add bullishly: ‘I just feel Gauld and Souttar won’t play.

‘When you look at it, Souttar hasn’t done particularly well against us or Stevie May. I feel he won’t play him.

‘Ryan Dow normally does okay against us so I think he’ll go with Dow in there instead of Gauld and bring him on later.’

Saints will miss Tim Clancy for the final after the full-back ruptured his Achilles tendon.

‘From my point of view it’s disappointing, but for someone to miss out on a cup final this late, I can’t imagine how he’s feeling,’ said Wright.

‘The players will know the team on Friday. I’ll tell the subs on Saturday morning because there’s one or two I’ll probably have to leave out.’ 

McNamara expects to tell his squad his starting side later on Friday once the fitness of a couple of key players becomes clearer.

‘(Gary) Mackay-Steven and (John) Souttar both didn’t start last week because of the flu,’ he revealed.

‘They trained on Tuesday and still looked a bit tired. They trained yesterday and we will see how they are.

‘I sort of know the team. Certain things have changed over the last couple of weeks.

'I have not entirely picked it yet, there are still one or two positions that we are still looking at.’

Undecided: McNamara says that he hasn't finalised his complete line-up for the final yet
