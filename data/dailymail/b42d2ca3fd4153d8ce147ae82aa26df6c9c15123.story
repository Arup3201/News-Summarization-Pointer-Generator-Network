A pair of rhinestone earrings Marilyn Monroe wore to a 1955 Hollywood film premiere have sold at auction for $185,000.

Julien's Auctions said in a statement Sunday that the actress wore the jewelry when she attended the opening of The Rose Tattoo.

Monroe did not appear in the film based on a Tennessee Williams play.

Glamorous: Earrings worn by Marilyn Monroe (pictured with Marlon Brando) to the 1955 premiere of the Burt Lancaster film The Rose Tattoo were sold at auctions Sunday for $185,000

The price included a 20 percent commission for the auction house.

The buyer was a foreign collector. The auction house does not release the names of buyers.

The sale was part of a two-day auction of Hollywood memorabilia Friday and Saturday at Julien's Beverly Hills gallery.

A lighter used by Humphrey Bogart sold for $19,200, and a 1986 Pontiac Firebird owned by David Hasselhoff was purchased for $152,600.
