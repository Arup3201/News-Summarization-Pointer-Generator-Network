Victim: Zong Qinghou, chairman of drinks giant Hangzhou Wahaha Group, was injured in a knife attack near his home in Hangzhou, east China, last Friday

China's second richest man has been attacked by a knife-wielding labourer after refusing to offer him a job, it is claimed.

Multi-billionaire tycoon Zong Qinghou, chairman of drinks giant Hangzhou Wahaha Group, has been left with severed tendons in his left hand following the 'revenge attack', according to state media.

The 67-year-old, who was until recently considered China's richest man, was confronted near his home in the city of Hangzhou in Zhejiang, east China, last Friday.

His attacker - identified as a 49-year-old migrant worker called Mr Yang - was arrested by police within hours of the assault.

Earlier this year, Mr Yang had borrowed 30,000 yuan (£3,069) to travel to Zhejiang from the neighbouring province of Jiangsu in search of work, according to Xinhua News Agency.

He sought out Mr Zong near his home after seeing him help impoverished migrant workers on a television programme and asked the self-made billionaire for a job.

He is said to have launched a knife attack on Mr Zong after his request for work was rebuffed.

The exact nature of the assault remains unclear - however, Mr Qinghou is reported to be recovering from his injuries.

Mr Zong, a self-made billionaire, speaks to journalists at a press conference in Hangzhou following the attack

Mr
 Zong, who fell to second place in China's rich list this year, has an 
estimated total wealth of nearly $19billion (£11.9billion).

He founded Wahaha in 1987 and built it into China's largest drinks manufacturer - maintaining a 60 per cent growth rate year on year.

Today, Mr Zong, who is known for his daily hobbies of smoking cigarettes and drinking tea, oversees an empire of more than 150 consumer products.

Despite his enormous wealth, he is reported to be a down-to-earth, no frills businessman who regularly makes a point of eating in his company's staff cafeteria.
