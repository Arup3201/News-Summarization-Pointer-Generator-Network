An expert in colour science has hit upon an intriguing idea on why Van Gogh painted as he did - and his insights could change the way we view the Master's art.

It has long-been rumoured than Van Gogh was colour-blind, and this theory is often cited as to why the artist painted with such bold strokes and vibrant, occasionally quirky hues.

When Japanese-based Kazunori Asada, giving a speech in Hokkaido about vision deficiencies, found himself viewing Van Gogh's work in a room illuminated to give the impression of colour-blindness, he found the pieces of art transformed into even better pieces of art.

He has now converted Van Gogh's work through the lens of colour-blindness - and shared his tool so you can try the experiment with your own choice of pictures - to see if others agree that Van Gogh looks better through impaired vision.

These sequences are as close a rendition as Asada has been able to re-create in a tool available to the public

But the landscape gets lost, with green and reds sapped from the picture: To a colour-blind viewer, some of the spectacular imagery is muted

Before and after: Asad runs The Starry Night through filter changes to see how the image looks when colour-blind

What we are used to seeing: The Starry Night, 1889, in it's original, unaltered state

Improvement? Viewed through a colour-blind lens, the textures and mood alters subtly, the outlines become less harsh, and the colours take on a different hue

Speaking of his experiences, he said: The 'Color Vision Experience Room' used illumination filtered by an 
optical filter - providing a modified spectrum of light.

'In this room, the person who has normal color vision sees color the same as the person
 who has protan or deutan color vision.

These types of color deficiency 
mean that certain color combinations are difficult to differentiate.

'There were prints of Vincent van Gogh’s paintings in the room.

Under the
 filtered light, I found that these paintings looked different from the 
van Gogh which I had always seen.

Van Gogh, 1853 -1890, is one of the most famous artists to have ever lived.

However he never achieved fame in his lifetime, leaving areas of his life a mystery to us.

It
 has been suggested, due to Van Gogh's use of colours and occasional 
drawing of halos around lights, that he suffered wither colour-blindness
 or a form of intermittent closed angle glaucoma.

The
 painter regularly drew coloured halos around light , especially in 
images painted at night, which occurs with this condition.

His
 heavy use of yellows in many painting implies this colour was either a 
favourite of his - or that he had a colour-blindness that made him use 
yellow intensely to create his perfect images.

He added: 'I love van Gogh’s paintings and have 
been fortunate to view a number of the originals in various art museums.

This painter has a somewhat strange way to use color. 

'Although the use 
of color is rich, lines of different colors run concurrently, or a point
 of different color suddenly appears.

I’ve heard it conjectured that van
 Gogh had color vision deficiency.

'However, in the van Gogh images seen in the color vision experience 
room, to me the incongruity of color and roughness of line had quietly 
disappeared.

'And each picture had changed into one of brilliance with 
very delicate lines and shades. This was truly wonderful experience.'

People with normal colour vision can see the full spectrum - blue, green and red light. This is called 'trichromacy'.

The photo-receptor cells within the eyes (the 'cones') do the translation work for us, but some people are missing one cone.

Protanopia, the most common, is lacking red receptors, and is the type emulated in these Van Gogh images.

The others are deuteranopia  - a lack of green receptors - and tritanopia, which is the lack of blue receptors.

He continued: 'One of my friends who has protanomal color 
vision, a designer and painter, said this to me:

''Isn’t it wonderful? We color deficient people have understood Gogh’s 
true wonderfulness and we have said that he is the genius of geniuses.

'But color normal people do not understand it well, seemingly.

'Gogh was 
surely color vision deficiency.

'Therefore, color deficient people can 
better understand his pictures.'

Asada has created the 'Chromatic Vision Simulator' tool, available on PC, iPhone and Android, which allows normal-sighted people to see images through the eyes of those with one of the three usual colour deficiencies.

Users can upload any image and play with the different filters to see how an approximation of how it looks to someone with colour-blindness.
