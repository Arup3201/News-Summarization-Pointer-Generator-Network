His day in court: Onyango Obama, 69, faces deportation and testified in his defense in a Boston immigration court on Tuesday

President Obama's uncle has testified at his deportation hearing that he housed his famous relative for a few weeks when he was student at Harvard Law School.

This statement contradicts earlier claims by the White House, which says that Barack Obama has never met his controversial uncle Onyango Obama.

The 69-year-old half-brother of the president's late father will be allowed to remain in the United States after a hearing at a Massachusetts Immigration Court on Tuesday afternoon.

After listening to witnesses praise the liquor store owner's high moral character from his friends and landlord, the immigration judge ruled that he should be allowed to apply for legal citizenship.

Onyango Obama has lived in the United States since the 1960s, when he came here as a teenager to attend school. Obama, a liquor store manager, was ordered to leave the country in 1992, but remained.

His immigration status did not become public until his arrest for drunken driving in 2011 in Framingham, just west of Boston.

After his arrest, he allegedly told police, ‘I think I will call the White House.’

Today,
 he said he did not remember making that specific request upon his 
arrest, but Boston Globe journalist Maria Sacchetti reports that he said
 he 'made a mistake drinking 3 beers' before getting behind the wheel 
that night.

In court, he 
listed his relatives that live in the U.S., including the most famous 
family connection: 'I do have a nephew. He's the President of the United
 States.'

He went on to say that Barack Obama stayed with him for three weeks when he first moved to Cambridge in order to attend Harvard Law School.

The president started at Harvard in 1988, and his press office has previously claimed that he never actually met the 69-year-old.

The elder Obama's landlord, Alfred Ouma, 
also testified that Barack stayed with his uncle when he was a student 
in Boston. The White House has not yet commented on today's proceedings.

Earlier this year, the Board of Immigration Appeals sent the case to the Executive Office for Immigration Review for reassessment.

Margaret Wong, Obama's Cleveland-based immigration attorney, called him a ‘wonderful older gentleman.’

‘He has earned his privilege to stay in the United States. He has been here for 50 years,’ she said Tuesday before the hearing.

The White House has said it expects the case to be handled like any other immigration case.

In the drunken driving case, Obama admitted to sufficient facts, meaning he did not plead guilty but acknowledged prosecutors had enough evidence to convict him. 

Moral character: A friend and a landlord testified on Onyango's behalf, saying that he was a good neighbor who paid taxes and mentored Kenyan students in the United States

A judge continued the case for one year without a finding, saying the charge would be dismissed if Obama did not get arrested again during that time. Wong said Obama has successfully completed that program.

In the president's memoir, Dreams from My Father, he writes about his 1988 trip to Kenya and refers to an Uncle Omar, who matches Onyango Obama's background and has the same date of birth.

Onyango is the second Obama family member to be found living illegally in the United States.

His sister, Zeituni Onyango, the president's aunt, made headlines when she was granted asylum in 2010 after her first asylum request in 2002 was rejected and she was ordered deported in 2004.

She did not leave the country and continued to live in public housing in Boston.

Her status was revealed just days before Obama was elected in November 2008. At the time, then-candidate Obama said he did not know his aunt was living here illegally and that he believes laws covering the situation should be followed.
