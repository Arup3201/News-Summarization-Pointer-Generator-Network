The loss of a Sydney man's cat spurred him to make sure other pet owners never went through the same pain he felt when his feline 'best friend', Rango, went missing.

For the past year, Sebastian Langton, 33, has been developing a GPS pet tracker that is believed to be the smallest, lightest and fully waterproof in the world.

The Pod, which is a size of a cork and weighs just 29 grams, is cylindrical and can be strapped onto a pet to track its movements.

The loss of Sebastian Langton's cat spurred him to create a GPS tracker for other pet owners

The Pod is no larger than a wine cork and weighs only 29 grams to ensure it can be comfortably attached to a pet's collar

To help fund the project, Mr Langton and his partner, Damien Cantelo, started a crowdfunding campaign on the Indiegogo website, which has raised more than $100,000 - double what they had set out to raise - at the time of this article's publication.

The idea for the Pod came about when Mr Langton, from Kirribilli, lost his tabby cat and best friend, Rango, in 2013.

He said for three days he was 'distraught' and hoping his cat of two years would return.

'[Rango] was just everything to me. He was so cool,' Mr Langton told Daily Mail Australia.

Rango went missing in 2013 and was later found dead on the side of the road by a stranger

Mr Langton and his partner decided to crowdfund some of the development of the tracker

So far, the campaign has raised more than $100,000, which is double their initial goal

'We used to hangout in cafes and he used to ride on the motorbike with me to work.'

Unfortunately for Mr Langton, Rango was not found alive.

'I was notified by a note pinned to a tree that said a person had found beautiful tabby cat on the side of the road,' Mr Langton said.

'It was the most heart-wrenching thing, you never get to say goodbye properly.

'I'm not saying the Pod would have saved Rango, but it would have helped me make sure he was safe. 

'It would have allowed me to find him straight away and be there for him.'

Mr Langton has described Rango as the 'coolest cat in the world' and his 'best friend'

Rango would ride on Mr Langton's motorbike and chill out with him at cafes

The tabby cat had only been with Mr Langton for two years before he went missing

The Pod uses GPS technology which allows pets in another state or country to be detected via an application on a mobile phone or computer.

Mr Langton - who had previous experience with GPS technology - said a lot of his money and his team's had gone into readying the product for launch, including research and development, product design and initial testing.

The money raised by crowdfunding was for the mass production of the Pod to ensure the device was in people's hands by Christmas as well as improving it.

Mr Langton said he was blown away by the support he had received for the project.

'It's fantastic. Anybody backing what you have created and supporting you, it matters a lot to me,' he said.

'It's a real passion project. It's not something I've come up with randomly.' 

The 33-year-old said they were also looking to align themselves with a charity so proceeds can also go to them.
