Loose Women returned for its 19th series today with a new look set and anchor presenter.

But while the face may have been new to the show, it was a familiar one to TV viewers - as Gloria Hunniford, 74, has taken the helm. 

The ITV show, which has been running since 1999, also had a new logo and opening credits. But it didn't go down well with all of their viewers.

Experienced: Gloria Hunniford has been presenting for decades

Hundreds took to the show's Facebook page to complain that they hated the new set and felt the show had been too 'Americanised'. 

Zarie Halliday wrote: 'Awwwwful show. Hate set.'

Jacqueline Khanum added: 'I did not like the new set...table too small....didn't like the changing colours behind special guest...the tune has changed....unforgivable!!!!!' 

Meanwhile Ann Edwards, who was a member of the live audience today, wrote: 'Really thought that I would like to see the show live but not after today's show. BRING BACK THE OLD GIRLS they were entertaining.'

 

Revamp: Returning for its 19th series, the show also has a new set and logo

Christine Hooson agreed. She wrote: 'I much prefer the original panel, won't be watching as much... don't see Gloria Hunniford as a Loose Woman sorry.'

The 'old girls' include former presenters Carol McGiffin, 54, Denise Welch, 56 and Jane McDonald, 51. 

While they had a loyal following, they were often accused of 'ranting' on screen. And sometimes their off-screen behaviour was talked about more than the news of the day. 

In a bid to reviving flagging viewing figures, it seems the show's new editor, Martin Frizell has decided to turn to safe hands in the form of Hunniford. He's also hired former This Morning legend Judy Finnigan, 66.

Unlike some of their Loose Women predecessors, they both have wholesome reputations as devoted mothers and epitomise ageing gracefully. 

Special guest: Joan Collins appeared on today's lunchtime show

Starting as they mean to go on:  It is hoped viewing figures will go up thanks to the new presenter, set and star guests - but not all viewers were impressed with the changes

Tempting Finnegan back to TV is a particular coup after she has been focused on novel writing in recent years and once swore she was finished with presenting. 

She said last week that she was excited about joining Loose Women. 

'I know I said I wouldn't go back on the telly, but actually I'm looking forward to occasionally contributing to lively conversations between a group of outspoken and intelligent women,' she said.

When he revealed the new line up last week, Frizell said: 'I'm delighted we have been able to confirm more of Britain's best loved, successful, assertive and, let's face it, downright smart women to join our Loose Women team.'

At a time when many TV programmes have been accused of being ageist for ditching older stars, the ITV show has embraced veteran presenters.

New additions: Judy Finnigan, left, and Sharon Osbourne are also joining Loose Women

Also on board is former X Factor judge Sharon Osbourne, 61, while model Penny Lancaster, 43, represents a younger demographic.   

Hunniford said that she thinks the age range of the panellists will enhance the debate on the topical show.

She said: 'I am a great fan of the show and I'm really thrilled to be joining the team. I love a good debate and it's such a great challenge to be discussing the important issues of the day with women that span different generations - our opinions will certainly be very diverse! 

'The show is also very joyful and I'm looking forward to having lots of fun with the Loose Women - a girl couldn't ask for more!' 

The hosts and panel will rotate based on the presenters availability, so on today's show, Hunniford was joined by Ruth Langsford, Coleen Nolan and Janet Street-Porter.

The topics up for discussion included MPs' payrises and the plight of Ashya King, while they welcomed special guest Joan Collins, 81.
