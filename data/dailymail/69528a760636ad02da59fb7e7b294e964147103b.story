Ed Miliband refused 13 times yesterday to back David Cameron’s proposal for ‘home rule’ for England.

As the fallout from Scotland’s independence referendum threatened to engulf both main political parties, the Labour leader repeatedly declined to agree that Scottish MPs should be barred from voting on laws that only affect England.

He warned that the move would create two classes of MP – and suggested it could ‘drive our country apart’. 

However, there has been a backlash among his own MPs, many of whom warn that the party could be seen as ‘anti-English’ unless it supports reform that gives the country the same rights promised to Scotland.

Labour leader Ed Miliband said blocking Scottish MPs from voting on English issues would create two classes of MPs

Mr Miliband accused David Cameron of using the Scottish referendum to play politics against the Labour party

Former Labour welfare minister Frank Field, writing in today’s Mail, says the idea of Scottish MPs continuing to vote on health, welfare, taxation and other matters ceded to the Scottish Parliament is ‘dead in the water’.

He claims he went to see Mr Miliband as far back as 2010 and warned him about ‘the English question’ – but was ignored.

And Labour MP Kate Hoey said preventing Scottish MPs from voting on issues that affect only England was ‘the right thing to do’. 

The Prime Minister will hold a ‘council of war’ at Chequers on Monday with more than 20 senior Conservatives.

Downing Street, which yesterday insisted Mr Cameron will deliver on his pledge to devolve further powers to the Scottish Parliament come what may, is seeking to head off a Tory revolt over the last-ditch promises made to the Scots to help win last week’s No vote on independence.

Barring Scottish MPs from voting on key affairs would permanently cripple Labour’s power base at Westminster because of the party’s heavy reliance on the support of its 41 MPs north of the border.

Labour has 41 MPs in Scotland which could help it form a majority at next year's General Election

At the last election, the Conservatives won 296 of 533 seats in England – and would have had an overall majority of 59 if Scottish MPs were excluded.

Yesterday, as the row overshadowed the opening of the Labour party conference in Manchester, Mr Miliband was asked 13 times by the BBC’s Andrew Marr whether he backed the idea of ‘English votes for English laws’, but refused to give a direct answer. 

Under pressure, he suggested he might be open to a system of allowing English MPs greater ‘scrutiny’ of new laws that only affect England.

But he said that should be considered by a ‘constitutional convention’ that would begin next year after a Labour election victory. 

‘I am in favour of one House of Commons with 650 MPs because, goodness, we fought tooth and nail over the last two years to avoid our Parliament being split up and our United Kingdom being split up and I want to make sure that doesn’t happen,’ he said.

‘I’m not against the idea of greater scrutiny of legislation that particularly affects England by English MPs.

‘But we can’t do it in a back-of-the-envelope, fag packet way. Let’s not drive our country apart because David Cameron believes it is an opportunity for him to do it.’

Conservative Party chairman Grant Shapps told Sky News that Mr Cameron’s idea was ‘common sense’.

However, former Labour deputy prime minister Lord Prescott described the plan as a ‘Tory trick’ designed to ‘fix’ Westminster in the party’s favour.

A Survation poll for the Mail on Sunday found that two in three English voters believe MPs representing Scottish seats at Westminster should be banned from voting on issues such as health and education. Just one in five oppose the move.

David Cameron, Ed Miliband and Nick Clegg made 'a vow' to the Scottish people to transfer new powers to Edinburgh

EVASION ONE

Andrew Marr: It seems fairly clear that you have been put into a trap – either you agree with the Prime Minister and support English votes for English laws ... or you will be part of leaders getting together and fumbling it and reneging on the pact you’ve given to the Scottish people. How do you get out of that trap?

Ed Miliband: Well I want to come to the detail of that in a minute, but I want to make a broader point, which is a very, very important point for the future of our country. I think there is a huge danger that the political class is learning the wrong lessons from this referendum.

Marr: So David Cameron has connected that promise to English votes for English laws and a huge number of people in England say yes that is fair, it is absolutely fair; why should Scottish MPs be able to vote on taxes in England if English MPs aren’t able to vote on taxes in Scotland? They’re right about that, aren’t they?

EVASION TWO

Miliband: Well let’s be very clear about what David Cameron has done. He will have to speak for himself in the coming days. But what William Hague said very, very clearly on the radio on Friday morning was that these two processes, they wanted them to run in parallel.

Marr: In a principled way, what is wrong with English votes for English laws? It’s fair, isn’t it, it’s fair play?

EVASION THREE

Miliband: Well I think that we’ve got to look at all of the constitutional issues that have been thrown up.

Marr: But I’m asking a very specific question here.

EVASION FOUR

Miliband: I know and I’m going to come to it. Let me explain. Look I think there is a big problem, which is that power has been devolved in Scotland, power has been devolved in Wales, but governments of both parties have failed to devolve power in England. Now the first answer to that question is not to change the nature of the centralised power of Westminster over England. It is to devolve power in England and that is absolute.

Marr: But England is a country. England is a nation herself...

Miliband: Absolutely, absolutely.

Marr: And there is no reason, in fairness, why Scottish MPs should be able to vote on English laws if it can’t happen the other way around.

EVASION FIVE

Miliband: Absolutely. And we...

Marr: I want to keep on this very, very important principled question.

EVASION SIX

Miliband:  ...and we’ve got to look at all of these issues.

Marr: Would you accept English votes for English laws, as it’s called, or not?

EVASION SEVEN

Miliband: We’ll look ... at any proposals come forward with. Let me just say...

Marr: It’s a very straightforward question.

EVASION EIGHT

Miliband: Well and I’m going to ... I’m going to explain. And I tell you what, there isn’t a simple answer to this question. 

Marr: Yes there is.

Miliband: No there isn’t.

Marr: I’m sorry, yes or no? It’s very straightforward.

EVASION NINE

Miliband: No, there isn’t a simple answer. Let me explain why. We’ve been wrestling with this issue for 120 years, ever since we were talking about Irish home rule around a century ago. Now what is the issue? When you devolve power to some parts of the country in different ways to others, it throws up these questions. So, for example, let me give you another example. London MPs vote on transport issues outside London, but English MPs outside London don’t vote on transport issues in London, because they’re devolved...

Marr: That’s inside a country. I’m just asking again . . . the principled case against an English Parliament.

Miliband: Well hang on a minute, we are a country, we are a United Kingdom. Now the way I ... What I say about this is I am open to the idea of greater scrutiny of legislation by English MPs.

Marr: This ... I’m sorry to cut in, but the truth is that you’re against English votes for English laws because Labour wouldn’t dominate. Surely the answer to that is for Labour to do better in England ... not to refuse English people this basic justice?

EVASION TEN

Miliband: I’ve got to say to you, that’s not the history. I mean, look, the history is that when Labour has won majorities across the United Kingdom, we’ve won majorities in England too. I think it’s about this. I think it’s about the fact that we don’t play fast and loose with our constitution, we do change in the right way.

Marr: So I return again. Is there a principled case against, in effect, an English Parliament, or not?

EVASION ELEVEN

Miliband: Well I’m not in favour of a new parliament and a new tier of politicians. I don’t think that’s the answer, I’ve got to say to you. And I am in favour of one House of Commons with 650 MPs because, goodness, we fought tooth and nail over the last two years to avoid our parliament being split up and our United Kingdom being split up.

Marr: You’re using the word ‘scrutiny’. I’m wondering about votes really.

EVASION TWELVE

Miliband: Well, let me make this point. Well, there are two points to this. First of all, in practice the reality is it’s very hard to separate out legislation. Take tuition fees in England, right. You might say that’s an English-only issue. It has knock-on effects for Scotland as well in terms of public spending. Is that an English-only issue or a more universally applying issue? Secondly, I’m not in favour of a House of Commons that becomes divided.

Marr: But ... then you carry on with the injustice of Scottish MPs.

EVASION THIRTEEN

Miliband: No, no. No you look at it ... No, because you look at this issue in a calm, measured, correct way through a process, through a constitutional convention. I mean, goodness, we’ve been wrestling with this issue for 100 years. Of course we should take our time and look at this properly.
