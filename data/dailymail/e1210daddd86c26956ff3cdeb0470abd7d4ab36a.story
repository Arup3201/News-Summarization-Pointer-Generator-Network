'I fear we're going to lose a few more,' Hodgson told talkSPORT.

'I mean there's one or two that I know won't be able to join us against Italy because of the current problems that they're dealing with at the moment, so on this occasion in particular it won't be as strong a team as I maybe would have liked to put out.'
