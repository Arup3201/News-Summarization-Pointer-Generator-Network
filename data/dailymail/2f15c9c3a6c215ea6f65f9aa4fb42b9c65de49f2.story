Rapped: Madeline Grant (pictured) has been find £120 for bringing Oxford University's Union into disrepute after sparking a sexism row by boasting about her breasts during her election campaign for the post of librarian

An Oxford University student who boasted about her 'great' breasts in a bid to win votes in an election has been fined £120 for bringing its prestigious Union into 'disrepute'.

Former model Madeline Grant was campaigning for the post of Union Librarian when she sparked a sexism row by making references to her cleavage in her manifesto.

The 19-year-old, who is reading English literature and languages at St Hilda's College, declared in her campaign posters: 'I don't hack, I just have a great rack.'

Her comments triggered howls of protest about her ‘sexist’ attempt to sway votes.

Isabel Ernst, President of the Union, said Miss Grant had been fined £120 for bringing the Union into 'disrepute' by speaking out in the national press.

Miss Grant defended her election campaign in the Daily Mail in March by claiming that the offending remark had been a satirical joke to liven up the historic debating society's notoriously ruthless elections.

She said she altered her manifesto the next day to remove it, but the draft version was formally displayed in the Union for a day and was picked up and published by the student newspaper Cherwell.

A spokeswoman for the Union said: 'Miss Grant spoke to the national press while on the committee without permission from the president, which is against Union rules.'

She said Miss Grant had been a member of the standing committee, but lost her seat after what turned out to be an unsuccessful bid for the higher position of Union Librarian.

The spokeswoman confirmed Miss Grant has since resigned from the Union.

The Oxford Union was founded in 1823 and is one of the oldest debating societies in the world, with membership costing £200 for life.

Past presidents include William Gladstone, William Hague, Boris Johnson and Michael Heseltine — and everyone from Albert Einstein to Michael Jackson has appeared there.

Backing: Her mother, BBC presenter and former world champion in real tennis, Sally Jones, has been supportive of her daughter's plight, saying she was 'very much a feminist'

Miss Grant, the daughter of a 
property developer, won a place at Oxford while attending £10,000-a-year
King Edward VI High School for Girls in Birmingham.

She
is in her second year studying at St Hilda’s College, founded in 1893 
as a hall for women, although it has also admitted men since 2008.

In her manifesto, rather than dwelling on weighty suggestions for running the library, her policies included being committed to helping members ‘pull’, or find a sexual partner, as well as the claim that she once had ‘a hug’n’kiss from Johnny Depp’ and had dated ‘a shady Japanese businessman’ to gain sponsorship for a ball held at the Union.

A Union member said at the time: 'While this manifesto is clearly meant to be humorous, it shows a distinct lack of judgment.

'It is deeply saddening to see women objectifying themselves in manifestos.'

Speaking to the Daily Mail in March, 
she said: 'I thought my statement was really funny when I wrote it. I 
wanted to do something provocative.

'I
wrote it in a hurry, I did it last-minute in a couple of days. But as 
soon as I handed it in, I realised it might be offensive to some people,
so I rewrote it. The idea that I’m an anti-feminist is rubbish.'

She said her manifesto was changed by replacing the ‘rack’ comment with: ‘I’m just here for the craic’, as in the Irish expression for fun.

Miss Grant’s parents, who live in a £460,000 sprawling detached farmhouse in Ashorne, Warwickshire, have been supportive of their daughter.

Her father, John Grant, 71, is a retired civil engineer who has sat on the boards of numerous construction firms and property companies in Warwickshire.

Her mother, Sally Jones, 57, is a BBC journalist and former world champion in real tennis, the forerunner of lawn tennis. She said Madeline was 'very much a feminist'.

Two years ago, her mother wrote an article for the Daily Mail about Madeline’s experience as a would-be fashion model.

Aged 16, she modelled for a couple of designers at London Fashion Week. But a year later, after her concerned mother had encouraged her to eat more, she was told her 9st frame was too large for modelling — despite being 5ft 11in tall.
