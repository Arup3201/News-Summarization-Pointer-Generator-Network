Stunning images of an Indonesian girl holding a pet cat, a crowd of penguins on a South Atlantic island, and a colourful hot air balloon soaring over a red desert are in the running for the Sony World Photography Awards.

With just over one month remaining for photographers to enter the contest, the World Photography Organisation has revealed some of the submissions for the 2015 competition.

And the collection of photos is spectacular - with one of the standouts featuring an orangutan using a large banana leaf to shield itself from the driving rain.

Photographer Andrew Suryono said: ‘I was taking pictures of some orangutans in Bali and then it started to rain.

‘Just before I put my camera away, I saw this orangutan take a banana leaf and put it on top on his head to protect himself from the rain.

‘I immediately used my DSLR and telephoto lens to preserve this magic moment.’

This year's submissions include incredible images of wildlife and some of Earth's greatest landscapes. 

Launched in 2008, the awards are dedicated to supporting and cultivating photographic culture.

They are open to photographers of all levels - from amateurs to 'fully-fledged' professionals - and winners will be selected in four categories (professional, open, student and youth).

The open and youth competitions close on 5 January, while entries for the professional competition must be submitted by 8 January. The student competition closed earlier this month.
