Ahead of their must-win World Cup 
semi-final against Argentina in Sao Paulo, Sportsmail 
takes a closer look at Louis van Gaal's Holland side.

Player of the tournament: Arjen Robben (5 games, 3 goals)

The Flying Dutchman has been his side’s stand-out player, terrorising defenders in each of their five games. He scored two fine goals against Spain in their first match and was also on the scoresheet in the 3-2 win against Australia.

At 30, it seems Robben has got quicker with age, and his pace, particularly on the counter, has been pivotal to Holland’s progress thus far.

Tournament highlight: Demolishing Spain

Four years ago the only thing that stood between Holland and the World Cup trophy was Spain. A goal from Andres Iniesta in extra-time won La Roja the trophy in South Africa.

There was redemption for Arjen Robben and Holland in their match against Vicente Del Bosque’s side this time round, as the Bayern Munich winger and Robin van Persie tormented Iker Casillas and his defence. Both scored twice.

Spain never recovered from that emphatic 5-1 defeat in Salvador, exiting the tournament at the earliest opportunity having failed to win any of their group games.

Lowlight: Nigel de Jong’s injury against Mexico

The holding midfielder was forced off nine minutes into the Oranje’s last-16 clash with Mexico after suffering a groin injury, ruling him out of the rest of the tournament.

A mainstay in the Dutch starting XI for years, De Jong’s absence has been felt in midfield, with no like-for-like replacement capable of replicating his tenacious style.

Best goal: Robin van Persie v Spain, 5-1 group stage, Arena Fonte Nova, Salvador

On the brink of half-time - with Spain 1-0 up - Daley Blind played a stunning crossfield ball from the left to van Persie. The Manchester United forward repositioned himself brilliantly to throw himself at the pass and connect with a diving header rather than attempting a volley.

His improvised effort lobbed the stranded Casillas as prompted chaotic celebrations in the Dutch dugout. The comeback had begun.

How has the boss performed?

Brilliantly.
 Van Gaal has never had a problem telling people how great he is and now
 he has proved himself on the biggest stage of all.

The Dutchman has 
juggled his squad superbly and used substitutions to fantastic effect. 
Eyebrows were raised when he hauled Van Persie off against Mexico, only 
for his replacement Klaas-Jan Huntelaar to score the winner.

Those same 
eyebrows nearly fell off when he subbed first-choice goalkeeper Jasper 
Cillessen for Tim Krul in the 119th minute versus Costa Rica. Again his 
decision was vindicated though, as Krul proved the hero in the 
shoot-out, saving two spot-kicks.
