Two HIV-positive British bar workers stand accused of raping a 17-year-old boy after plying him with alcohol.

The gay couple, named so far only as Andreu Paul W, 38, and Warren H, 34, are said to have made their victim drink 'large quantities of vodka' after taking him back to their flat in Calpe, eastern Spain.

They are then accused of making him sniff an unknown substance and, when he had passed out, stripping him naked from the waist down and taking it in turns to rape him, El Mundo newspaper reports.

The Director of Public Prosecutions says the incident is alleged to have happened on March 7, 2008, and they returned back to Britain but were extradited to Spain in May the following year.

Spanish media reports that during the night, the couple met the teenager, also British, at the bar they were working at. 

After closing time, they went on to another pub, where they convinced him to come back to their flat.

Once there, prosecutors say they made him drink large amounts of vodka with 'the only intention to deprive him of his senses' until he lost his balance and fell to the floor.

They are then accused of carrying him to their bedroom, throwing him onto the bed and stripping him naked from the waist down - making him sniff an unknown substance. 

The couple then allegedly took it in turns to rape their victim.

The following day, the victim regained consciousness and left the house by foot.

He reported the alleged crime a month later, on April 2, when he visited a Guardia Civil station with his step-father and lawyer.

Despite the couple being HIV-positive, the boy was not infected with the virus but he is still reportedly suffering from post-traumatic stress disorder from the crime.

The men will stand trial in Alicante on Tuesday, October 2.
