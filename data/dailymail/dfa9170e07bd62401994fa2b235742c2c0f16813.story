Ian McKellen has warned the death of repertory theatre means Britain will not longer be able to produce acting greats such as Michael Gambon, Judi Dench or Derek Jacobi.

The award-winning actor - considered one of the finest of his generation - said we will not see their like again because the theatre system has become a 'desert'.

He said his years in regional rep were vital in developing his talent and without that experience the current crop are unlikely to become great actors later in their career.

Theatre: Ian McKellen is not 'snooty' about his film roles and is happy to be as famous for Lord of the Rings as for the famous production of Waiting for Godot, pictured with Patrick Stewart above

When asked if the current system could ‘produce another Sir Ian’ he said: ‘No. Nor Derek Jacobi, Mike Gambon or Judi Dench. I got better as an actor, and still I’m getting better. That’s only been possible because there’s always been work.’

The Lord of the Rings star began his career at the Belgrade Theatre in Coventry in the early 1960s where he trod the boards in Shakespeare, Chekhov and Agatha Christie.

Now, he believes actors move too quickly into film and television.

He told Reader’s Digest: ‘The situation is desperate. There are no [resident] companies in this country, not even the National Theatre has one. There’s a desert.

‘The danger is going to be that the current generation of actors won't develop into good middle–aged performers because they won't have been able to live from their work.

‘The strength of British theatre should be that these actors in their middle years know what they're doing and are good at it. Not rich, not famous, but making a living.’

He is not alone in his appreciation of regional rep - where a resident company perform a variety of plays, including classics and modern work.

Judi Dench has also previously spoken about the benefits of learning and making mistakes on the stage in the early part of her career.

Michael Gambon is also reported to have been advised by Laurence Olivier to take up regional rep.

McKellen added: ‘Why do you act? You act for an audience. In the theatre, you're in their presence.

‘Film stars don't know what it is to have an audience.

‘You see some at awards ceremonies who can hardly make it to the middle of the stage, they're so nervous. There's a microphone so they don't have to project. And they read their words.

‘You see a theatre actor come on and it's, “Oh, hold on, there's a show happening”.

‘Hugh Jackman at the Oscars – that's a theatre man who happens to be a film star.’

McKellen found international stardom in the latter half his career, particularly with his roles in the blockbuster Lord of the Rings trilogy and X-Men trilogy.

McKellen said he is not ‘snooty’ about the parts he takes.

He said: ‘I've always had very catholic tastes. Tolkien and X–Men are both good storytelling.

‘They're not franchises about cannibals or mindless outer space visitors. These are epic tales that do more than entertain.

‘Millions and millions of people have seen Lord of the Rings. Of course I'm more famous for that than Waiting for Godot. Just because a piece of work has been seen by so many more people doesn't mean it's less in value.

‘I'd as soon see a pantomime as a revival of Shakespeare; it all depends if it's any good.’
