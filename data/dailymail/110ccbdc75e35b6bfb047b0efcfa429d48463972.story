Kevin Pietersen implored England to entertain him on his day out at Lord’s but he had to wait before Gary Ballance gloriously granted his wish by responding to the most testing situation with a maiden Test century of rare class.

The sacked star sat in a hospitality box like a modern day Roman emperor in judgment on the new era as Ballance came to England’s rescue on a fourth day of this Investec series that displayed Test cricket in all its glorious unpredictability.

For much of the day Pietersen had watched Sri Lanka threaten to pull off an extraordinary first Test victory but he was nowhere to be seen when Ballance swung the spin of Rangana Herath high towards his Grandstand vantage point to reach his hundred with a six off the first ball of the day’s final over.

Cue another joyous English celebration
 to add to that of first innings double centurion Joe Root and a 
position of dominance from which England can push for victory on Monday even
 though they spent much of Sunday on the back foot.    

Only
 England, it seemed, could have forced anything other than a draw at the
 start of the day but from the moment Alastair Cook set a defensive 
field for the first over it was Sri Lanka who looked the more positive, 
proactive side.

Pietersen 
had tweeted his hope that England would quickly take the last three Sri 
Lankan wickets and then hurry to a 380 lead but, when Sri Lanka claimed 
five victims in the middle session, a declaration was the last thing on 
Cook’s mind.

As it turned 
out Pietersen’s demands were almost totally met but it was only when 
Ballance and Chris Jordan joined forces that Cook was able again to 
think about dictating terms on what could be a fascinating last day.

Sunday
 was largely Sri Lanka’s day, with captain Angelo Mathews joining Kumar 
Sangakkara on the Lord’s honours board on his first Test innings in this
 country and then Shaminda Eranga ripping the heart out of England’s top
 order.

Yet it still ended 
with the hosts 389 ahead and surely poised to declare overnight and attack
 Sri Lanka on a pitch that finally started to give bowlers minimal 
assistance before Ballance shifted the balance emphatically back in his 
side’s favour.

This was a 
big innings for Ballance, even though he is only playing his second 
Test, as England have asked a lot by elevating him to the all-important 
No 3 position ahead of Ian Bell and Root.

He
 did little to suggest he would make it his own in the first innings but
 now, with real pressure on England, the Yorkshireman displayed a calm 
temperament and a strength off the back foot that should serve him well 
in Test cricket.

How England needed him when they plunged to 121 for six 
after taking the last three Sri Lankan wickets in 70 minutes to give 
themselves a first innings lead of 122 in a first Test where bat had 
dominated ball for the first three days.

Eranga,
 the quickest of this ‘pop-gun’ Sri Lankan attack, had shown the way to 
attack on this pitch with a superb spell from the Nursery End that saw 
him take three for three in 21 balls and threatened to turn this first 
Test on its head.

But, after
 Rangana Herath had further preyed on home nerves with two wickets of 
his own, an English batsman of Southern African extraction showed a man 
in the stands who trod a similar path that the middle order is in safe 
hands.

When Matt Prior was 
the sixth Englishman to fall England led by only 243 with a minimum of 
125 overs left in the Test, more than enough time for Sri Lanka to 
recover from conceding 575 in the first innings to go 1-0 up in this 
two-Test series.  

Bizarre: Day four was most memorable for Nuwan Pradeep's bizarre dismissal for Sri Lanka

Pace: England's Chris Jordan bowled a short ball to Pradeep and it caught him off balance

Smash: Pradeep ended up dismissing himself by crashing into his own stumps, sending them sprawling

Out: England's Sam Robson walks back to the pavilion after his dismissal for 19 runs at Lord's

But two 
of the men England hope will lead the post-Pietersen era then took over,
 with Ballance initially playing second fiddle to Jordan in their 
fortune changing stand of 78 but then adding another 57 with Stuart 
Broad in the dominant manner he has shown in becoming such a force in 
domestic cricket. 

Only 
when he was on 36 did Ballance have an anxious moment after Sri Lanka 
reviewed Paul Reiffel’s not out decision to a caught behind appeal. 
Mahela Jayawardene, in particular, was furious when technology agreed 
with the on-field umpire but there was no sign of a HotSpot nor movement
 on Snicko.

Ballance, whose 
parents and brother flew over from Zimbabwe for this match, raced to his
 hundred before the close to save Cook an awkward choice on whether to 
bat on today and now England will hope their bowlers have enough time, 
with 17 overs in the match already lost to shoddy over-rates, to press 
home their advantage. 

‘It 
was a great feeling, I can’t really describe it,’ said Ballance on going
 to his hundred with a six. ‘With an over to go I didn’t want to muddle 
around with singles. Luckily I got a slog sweep out of the middle.’

It was a moment and method that Pietersen would surely have approved of.
