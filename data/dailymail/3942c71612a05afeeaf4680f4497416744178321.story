Ryan Shawcross was grappling in the area with Graziano Pelle on Wednesday evening, despite Stoke's assistant manager insisting he had been brought off man marking and onto zonal marking.

Shawcross, who conceded a penalty on October 19 against Swansea after wrestling with Wilfried Bony in the penalty area, was part of the Stoke City side that lost 1-0 at Southampton on Saturday.

The defender was named as a serial offender of penalty area 'dark arts' by former referee Graham Poll as we launched our 'Hands Off In The Box' campaign.

Southampton this time visited the Britannia Stadium on Wednesday night in the Capital One Cup, and pictures show the defender with his arm around the Italian's chest from behind.

Stoke assistant manager Mark Bowen had said last week: 'On Saturday — and it shouldn't happen like this — we tried to pull him out of the spotlight if you like. 

'So instead of Ryan marking from a corner, we put him in an area where he could attack the ball in a more zonal area.

'That's not his game, he's not been brought up on that. 

'But it comes to something where you've got to try and change your system of marking because you're worried the lad is getting targeted.

'He's our captain, one of our best headers of the ball. You want Ryan Shawcross to be marking their most dangerous player. 

'Even if Ryan doesn't do a full grab but the referee is looking for him, you couldn't leave that to chance. It's at the detriment to us.' 

Stoke lost the game 3-2 after bravely fighting back from being two goals down in the first-half.
