A senior violinist at Russia's Bolshoi Theatre has died following a freak accident when he fell from the stage into the orchestra pit.

Viktor Sedov, 65, who had performed at the world-famous theatre in Moscow for four decades, died in hospital as a result of his injuries following the fall on Tuesday.

Bolshoi spokesman Katerina Novikova said Mr Sedov, who played in the second violins, was a much-loved member of the theatre and was known for his 'sense of humour and extraordinary erudition'.

She told the AFP news agency: 'Viktor Sedov, who had worked almost 40 years at the Bolshoi, fell into the orchestra pit on Tuesday and died on Wednesday in hospital as a result of his injuries.'

In January this year, an artistic director at the Bolshoi nearly lost his sight when he had acid thrown in his face outside his Moscow home.

Sergei Filin, 42, suffered third-degree burns to his face and neck in the attack.

However dancers and staff at the Bolshoi later suggested that Mr Filin may have staged the attack himself.

Last week the theater's director general Anatoly Iksanov was fired and replaced by Vladimir Urin, who previously headed Moscow's Stanislavsky Musical Theatre.

Russian Culture Minister Vladimir Medinsky said only that the 61-year old Iksanov, who led the Bolshoi for nearly 13 years, was dismissed because of a 'difficult situation at the theatre'.
