Virtual reality may seem like a niche activity reserved for gamers, but its potential is also proving worthwhile in the battlefield.

The Norwegian Army is trialling a system that uses the Oculus Rift headset to drive armoured vehicles without soldiers having to stick their heads above the hatch.

Cameras mounted around the vehicle film its surroundings and this footage is fed to the driver through the headset, creating the illusion that the tank is ‘transparent.’

The Norwegian Army is trialling a system that uses the Oculus Rift headset to drive armoured vehicles, pictured. Soldiers can wear the headset, and use it drive the tank, above or below the hatch and it has been designed to protect them from gunfire and remove driving blindspots

The Technion-Israel Institute of Technology has created a system called Stella Maris, short for Stellar Marine Refractive Imaging Sensor.

It works by digitally altering images from a camera mounted onto a submarine so the driver can see above the surface without a periscope.

This protects submarines from revealing their position.

The system can compensate for visual distortions caused by waves moving through the water's surface by using the position of the sun at a set time.

The rays shine though underwater pinhole array onto a glass image plane.

The successful tests were recently carried out in Rena, Norway and were filmed by TUTV.

When a driver looks left, they see footage from the left camera, and vice versa on the right - achieving a 360-degree view of the road.

By lowering their gaze and looking down towards the vehicle belts, the driver can also use the system to parallel park 'with a precision of up to a centimetre', without the assistance of the vehicle commander. 

The system means soldiers can remain below the hatch and protected from gunfire for as long as possible, and means commanders can spend more time analysing the situation and potential risks, rather than guiding the driver through the terrain.

It also removes the blind spots that occur when driving large vehicles.

Hamar-based firm Making View developed the system with assistance from the Norwegian Army‘s Combat Lab.

The tests are conducted using commercial equipment, which is expected to be released for general deployment in Norwegian armoured vehicles in the near future. Norway's Combat Lab said the system could be operational in five years' time

The augmented reality software used in the Battlefield Management System is designed by Augmenti in Trondheim.

This software also lets drivers see various other elements plotted on the visor such as weapons and minefields in the field or enemy troops, similar to how they appear on video games.

Major Ola Petter Odden at Combat Lab told TUTV: ‘This is a very promising concept.

‘Normally you are more or less blind because there is armour all around you. With this system you can see just as well as if you were seeing out the hatch.

'It’s more strenuous for eyes since it’s a synthetic picture, so it will be used when you think you could be shot at.’

The tests are conducted with commercial equipment, which will be released for general deployment in Norwegian armoured vehicles in the near future. 

Combat Lab told TUTV the system could even be operational in five years’ time.

‘I can foresee that the system will be technologically mature in maybe two to three years. Then we will need a qualification period for the equipment to be ready for use in traffic.

'So maybe it will be ready in five years,’ continued Major Odden.
