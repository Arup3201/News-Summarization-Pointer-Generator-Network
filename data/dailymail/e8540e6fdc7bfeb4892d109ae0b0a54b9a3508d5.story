A holidaymaker has been reunited with a lost SD memory card containing 300 pictures of her backpacking adventure - after an internet campaign to track her down.

Catriona Bowman, 22, thought the digital pictures of her summer trip around Europe with friend Emily Fazah, 23, had gone forever when she lost the camera card in a bar in Amsterdam last July.

But the miniature card, measuring just half an inch across, was later found by Dutch advertising agency boss Peter van Leeuwen on a baggage belt at Amsterdam's Schiphol airport.

He looked at the pictures on the card to see if there were any clues to identify the owner and saw that they showed two young women travelling around Europe.

Mr van Leeuwen launched a social media campaign to try to track down the mystery women so he could return their snaps to them.

He put a selection of the pictures on YouTube in a video montage called 'Who's That Girl?' and posted links to it on Facebook and Twitter.

His 24 second video ended up being viewed 33,500 times after the story of his search was picked up by Dutch newspapers and radio stations.

Memories: Catriona Bowman and her friend Emily Fazah, pictured right, had taken photos of their travels through San Sebastian in Spain and Biarritz on the Atlantic coast of France before heading to Amsterdam

Finally a friend of Miss Bowman and Miss
Fazah who lives in Amsterdam saw the YouTube posting and realised the 
pictures were of them.

The two young women from Woodbridge, Suffolk, have now made contact with Mr van Leeuwen who has emailed them all the pictures - six months after they lost them.

Miss Bowman who is currently working as an assistant in a ski shop in France said she was 'ecstatic and in shock' to get the pictures back.

She said: 'It is absolutely bizarre. We were convinced they had gone for ever.

'We are truly grateful to Peter for going to so much effort to track us down. The pictures hold so many amazing memories for us.'

Miss Bowman said the 300 pictures were taken in the first few weeks of a three month backpacking trip that her and Emily were taking around Europe last summer.

Most of the snaps showed the pair enjoying the sights around San Sebastian in the Basque region of Spain and Biarritz on the Atlantic coast of France before they travelled to Amsterdam.

Miss Bowman said: 'We were in a bar 
by a canal in Amsterdam when I realised my memory card was full as I had
been taking pictures all day.

'Emily
had a spare card in her glasses case so we quickly exchanged the cards,
but a little while later we realised the full one had gone missing.

'We went back to the bar and were pulling cushions off chairs to try and find it, but it was nowhere to be seen.

'Afterwards
we just bought another card and got on with our travelling. It was just
annoying because I had lost all the pictures from the early part of our
trip.

Campaign: The card was found on the baggage belt of Amsterdam airport by Peter van Leeuwen who began a social media campaign to find the owner

'It came as a complete surprise when we were contacted by the friend who we were staying with in Amsterdam who told us our pictures had turned up on YouTube.

'We were amazed to hear that the SD card had landed up on a conveyor belt at the airport several miles from Amsterdam city centre.

'How it got there from the bar is an absolute mystery.

'When I briefly spoke to Peter on a Dutch radio station, he was quite apologetic for not putting the pictures online sooner.'

Miss Fazah, a media and broadcasting technology student at Leeds University, said: 'We don't know how the memory card got to the airport.

'We went back to the bar where we lost it on more than one occasion but eventually gave up hope.

'That was last summer - but then I got a call saying there was a big campaign launched to find us.

'I couldn't believe it.'

Mr van Leeuwen, creative business partner at Dutch advertising agency Etcetera, said: 'It's amazing how fast news travels on Facebook.

'It's really the new 'lost and found'.

'That's why I decided to put it on Facebook and YouTube instead of bringing the card to the lost and found-department of Schiphol Airport.'Â
