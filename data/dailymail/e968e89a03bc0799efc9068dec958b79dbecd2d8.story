Sponsors Zoopla have told West Bromwich Albion to axe Nicolas Anelka or lose their £3million deal.

The former France striker should know early next week whether the FA will charge him over the quenelle gesture he made after scoring against West Ham three weeks ago.

Albion fear he could be handed a lengthy ban and have called on the FA to speed up their investigation.

Controversy: The quenelle is a gesture linked with anti-Semitism back in Anelka's French homeland

But, according to a report in Marketing Week, the property portal has contacted the club to voice their dissatisfaction following Anelka’s actions, which some say carry anti-Semitic overtures.

Zoopla, owned by Jewish businessman Alex Chesterman, say Anelka must be dropped for Monday night’s game against Everton and have told the club they will want their name removed from the club’s shirts immediately if he plays.

A club spokesman said: ‘West Bromwich Albion will be making no further comment until the Football Association have concluded their investigation, and the club their own internal enquiry, into the matter.’

Albion had played down the issue and kept the 34-year-old striker in their side. But they are aware of the arguments around the incident and are conscious of the club’s image.

One Jewish Albion fan said: ‘I want to support the club I love, but their refusal to issue a real apology or remove Anelka from first-team selection makes that somewhat difficult.’

If Anelka does receive a long ban, it would cast a shadow over his Albion career. Signed by former manager Steve Clarke in the summer, he got off to a troubled start when he announced he planned to quit the game following the sudden death of close friend Eric Manasse.

Though Clarke convinced him to play on, Anelka struggled for form, then suffered a series of injuries.

The Liverpool defender was pictured twice doing the gesture, once with Dieudonne, lastmonth. But he later said he did not know what it meant and had been ‘tricked’.

The Hull forward tweeted a picture of Anelka’s celebration and wrote: ‘Anelka is a legend i love him is a best french striker’ and included a message of support for Dieudonne.

The website’s two-year deal is due to run
 out this summer and no announcement has been made about a renewal. The 
latest problems almost certainly leave the club looking for a new backer
 for next season, if not before.

The authorities have to consider the legalities of the Frenchman’s latest predicament and the club’s sporting and technical director Richard Garlick has asked the FA to come up with a decision quickly.

He said: ‘It would help everyone for the investigation to be over as soon as possible. The FA have given a statement about how quickly they would do that.’

Anelka could be short of firepower without Anelka, having sold Shane Long to Hull City yesterday.

However, the club have confirmed they will not be spending during the transfer window.

‘We have a number of strikers who have emerged, including Saido Berahino,’ said Garlick. ‘If we need to get a short-term deal to solve any striking issue, then we will try to do that.

‘We have a good selection of strikers. They have all trained this week.’

When
 West Brom striker Nicolas Anelka scored the first of his two goals in 
Saturday's 3-3 Premier League draw at West Ham, he celebrated by making a
 gesture largely unfamiliar to fans of English football.

But
 the salute, known in France as 'la quenelle', is the subject of a 
fierce national debate that has reached the French interior ministry and
 stands accused of sparking a spate of attacks across Anelka's homeland.

Here,
 we explore the origins of the controversial gesture and the motives of 
its self-proclaimed inventor, the stand-up comedian and political 
activist Dieudonne M'Bala M'Bala:
