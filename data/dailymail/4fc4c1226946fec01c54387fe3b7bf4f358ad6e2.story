Crufts dog show boasts the best of preened pooches of all breeds, colours, shapes - and sizes.

Scrabble the Leonberger and Mimi the Chihuahua demonstrated the impressive variety the competition has to offer, as they were captured together in an adorable photograph.

Tiny Mimi stood between the front legs of sturdy Scrabble on the third day of Crufts, which saw 27,000 dogs fill Birmingham's NEC Arena over the weekend.

Golden-coated Scrabble stood tall above little Mimi, who pulled off her best puppy dog eyes for the cameras.

Both dogs work as volunteers for the charity Pets As Therapy and Scrabble won the charity's competition for dog of the year.

His owner Ann Burrell said: 'He 
epitomises all that Pets As Therapy stands for. He gives unconditional 
love to everyone he meets.'

The adorable pair were not the only canines to catch the attention of show-goers over the four-day competition.

A common sight at the show, which attracted 145,000 visitors, was dogs dressed in outfits by their proud owners.

Some wore simple cotton vests and humorous bibs which made them stand out from the crowd.

But American
Cocker Spaniel Ricky brought a little sparkle to the arena in a 
decorative green snood with gold detail, while his coat was tied up with
purple hair clips.

Poodle Toy Lincoln was a poser and appeared to give a wink to the camera, while another dog seemed more camera shy and buried its snout in a nearby Ugg boot.

Dog lovers from 41 countries, from as far afield as Hong Kong, India, Indonesia and Malaysia, took part in the event.

A record 2,131 dogs were registered, with 13 new breeds making their debuts in the breed-judging, gamekeepers' classes and obedience championships.

Crufts was founded in the Victorian era by Charles Cruft - with the inaugural show attracting 2,437 entries to the Royal Agricultural Hall in Islington in 1891.
