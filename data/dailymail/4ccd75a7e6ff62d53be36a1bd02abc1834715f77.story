The completion of James Rodriguez £60million transfer to Real Madrid completes the most frightening, and most expensive trio in world football.

In fact, when added to Gareth Bale and Cristiano Ronaldo's £86m and £80m deals, Real can now boast an attacking midfield that costs more than the transfer spend of Dutch giants Ajax in their entire 114-year history.

The four-time European Cup winners have spent just £183million on transfers - £43million less than the Real cash splashed out on the expensively-assembled trio.

Expensive: £86m Gareth Bale

Rich: £60m James Rodriguez

Pricey: £80m Cristiano Ronaldo

Reach for the stars: James Rodriguez is the final piece in the most expensive team in world football

Two become three: Bale and Ronaldo will have to make room for one more superstar in the Madrid XI

While Ajax's record signing was £13million Miralem Sulejmani, only Marcelo (£5m, signed aged 19), Raphael Varane (£8m, aged 18), Daniel Carvajal (£4m, aged 21) and Diego Lopes (£3m) cost less from next year's expected Real starting XI

Madrid have a history of expensive signings from the Galactico era, but the class of 2014 put even the likes of Zinedine Zidane, David Beckham and Luis Figo to shame.

Even Barcelona, who added £75million Luis Suarez to the £71million purchase of Neymar this summer, don't come close - although the disparity is helped by the inclusion of La Masia product Lionel Messi, whose transfer fee in today's market could help Barca make up the £80million gap.

And so as Rodriguez dons a Real shirt for the first time on Tuesday evening, he completes a staggering £226million line-up that will leave the money men as opened-mouthed as the defenders who will likely be chasing shadows in La Liga next season.

Low budget: The lack of funds spent at Ajax didn't stop Johan Cruyff and Patrick Kluivert from lifting trophies
