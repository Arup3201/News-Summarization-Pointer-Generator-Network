Veteran: Wogan said older female broadcasters once used their 'glamour' to land roles

TV legend Terry Wogan has said female TV presenters shouldn't complain about not getting work later in their careers because they used their good looks land roles when they were young.

The British broadcasting icon waded into the sexism on television row, saying women use their 'glamour' to make a name for themselves when starting out in the industry.

He said that females who complain when the work dries up later should remember why they were given presenting jobs in the past, describing broadcasting as a 'visual medium'.

Wogan's comments come after the Labour Deputy Leader Harriet Harman accused TV bosses of being 'very rude' to older female stars.

The Shadow Secretary of State for culture was responding to figures which showed that eighty per cent of TV presenters over the gae of 50 in the UK are men.

But Wogan, who has worked for the BBC for almost 5 decades, said it was natural for older woman to phased out as they age - even saying that stars of today such as Holly Willoughby and Tess Daly will be 'replaced' by the next generation of attractive presenters.

Speaking in The Times magazine, he responded to Herman's outburst, saying: 'I think a number of the people who have been protesting originally got the jobs because of their glamour.

'I think it’s a little unfair, but it is a visual medium.'

When asked about the stars of today, such
as Willoughby and Daly, he said: 'They’ll be replaced by the next 
generation of attractive female presenters.'

Wogan's comments are the not the first to
come from a veteran male broadcaster reacting to claims that their is a
shortage of older women on TV.

Alan Titchmarsh has said that women who complained about being sidelined on TV when they got older should stop 'whingeing'

Speaking earlier this year, the TV gardener said: 'Men in television tend to last a bit longer at the end of their careers, but it is women who make hay at the beginning.'

“They don’t complain in their early days when they are disporting themselves on sports cars.'

Despite the row over sexism on TV being stoked by Wogan's latest remarks, the former voice of the Eurovision Song Contest said he hopes scandals such as executives pay and the Jimmy Savile affair will strengthen the public broadcaster rather than send it into decline.

He said: ' I just hope that nothing happens to diminish the BBC because without it, for this country, it would be like losing royalty.'
