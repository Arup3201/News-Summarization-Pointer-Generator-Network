Manuel Pellegrini admits his team's recent performances are concerning him after Manchester City were knocked out of the Capital One Cup by Newcastle on Wednesday night.

Rolando Aarons and Moussa Sissoko scored the only goals of the game at the Etihad Stadium to stun the holders.

And the Chilean boss accepts his team are 'not what they used to be' at the moment, a worrying statement for fans with a derby against Manchester United next up in the Premier League.

'We didn't play well, we didn't move the ball the way we normally do and we're not scoring chances we have,' Pellegrini said.

'It's a concern because its a week where weve conceded too many and we're not scoring. They might be a little bit nervous. 

'At the moment we're not a team we used to be.'

Asked if he was worried about the derby, he replied: 'Of course we must be worried - we didn’t win the three games we played this week. We must be worried about that but we must find a solution and we must address it.' 

Pellegrini wasn't too fearful over the injuries picked up during the defeat, revealing David Silva will be checked up on on Wednesday while Yaya Toure's knock 'wasn't serious'.

Niall Quinn echoed Pellegrini's statements that something wasn't quite right at City following the defeat.

They're not at it.,' he added. 'The batteries flat, they need something to charge it. There's something quite not right there at the moment, they'll need to put it right this weekend. 

'They need to be far more revved up, Newcastle were allowed to dictate the pace. They took that chance and exposed City.'
