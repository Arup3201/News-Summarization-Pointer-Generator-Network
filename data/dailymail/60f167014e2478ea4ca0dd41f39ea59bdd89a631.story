It’s the type of job most youngsters can only dream about.

But now No Man’s Land Fort is searching for a manager - who will count sailing, fishing and sabrage in their skills set.

A day at the office will start with a commute to the middle of the Solent - arriving by speedboat or helicopter to the venue – which looks like a hideout for a James Bond villain.

No a bad office: No Man's Land Fort in the Solent is looking for a new manager

Out to sea: The private island, which is opening as a resort in the autumn, was built between 1867 and 1880

The chosen candidate will be looking after the AmaZing Venues property – one of three 19th-century Grade II-listed buildings in the Solent.

The luxury ‘citadel in the sea’ boasts 22 bedrooms, a museum, gym, nightclub, pool room, two helicopter pads, a lighthouse, rooftop hot pool and even a street complete with cobbles.

The job also includes arranging grandiose get-togethers – including hosting laser fort parties.

Traits the ideal candidate must possess include being able to work on their own initiative – as the nearest neighbours are separated by more than a mile of sea.

The post, which starts before the fort - between Portsmouth and the Isle of Wight - opens its doors as a holiday venue in the autumn, is billed as ‘the envy of every sailor in the Solent’.

Reporting to the general manager of Solent Forts, the position, according to AmaZing Venues, is: ‘Suited to a luxury hospitality expert, with a keen eye for detail, exceptional customer service skills, experience of managing large venues and teams and hosting grandiose get-togethers.’

Duties include: Clearing the seagulls from the fort’s two helicopter pads; Testing the guns in the laser tag playground; Going to the top of the lighthouse tower to check the bulb; and Testing the temperature is suitable for guests in the rooftop hot pool.

And applications can be submitted online via the holiday company's website, although the company has not revealed what the salary is for the position.

Mark Watts, General Manager of Solent Forts, said: 'We are looking for someone as special as the venue itself – someone who can really rule without being a tyrant!

'No Man’s Land is the second fort we’re opening to the public in our collection and we need someone who will take care of the day-to-day running of the fort and provide the excellent customer service that our wider collection of properties is known for.

'A sturdy pair of sea legs is essential for the commute too.'

Boasting armour-plated granite and steel walls, the Victorian sea fort off the coast of Portsmouth was originally built to house nearly 80 soldiers to fend off an attack from the French navy.

More than a century later, it has spent its life as a luxury hotel and was sold again in 2008 – expected to fetch up to £4m.

The
 imposing fort was one of a string of fortifications along the south 
coast ordered by Victorian Prime Minister Lord Palmerston who feared an 
attack from Napoleon III.

Built between 1861 and 1880 it needed a huge engineering effort to cut vast blocks of granite and transport them by barge to the building site, before they were lowered onto the sea bed for its foundations. It was built complete with lighthouse and emplacements for 49 cannon.

The fort is nearly 200 feet across and rises 60 feet from the sea. Its water supply comes from a borehole sunk into the seabed and it has its own electricity generators.

Its sunken inner centre is screened from the elements by a glass roof and its interior now contains all modern luxuries.

As well as the themed bedrooms such as the history of Concorde room, it boasts jacuzzis, a gym, a roof garden and two restaurants.

The exotic location is well known to passengers on the Isle of Wight ferry and has also featured as a backdrop to a 1971 Dr Who adventure called The Sea Devils starring Jon Pertwee.

During the Second World War the fort housed anti-aircraft guns but was decommissioned in 1957.

It was turned into a private residence in the 1990s before its reinvention as a luxury hotel and an events and hospitality venue to be used by businessmen to entertain their clients.
