Joanna Yeates’s killer wept in the dock yesterday as harrowing images of her dead body were shown to a court.

Photographs were displayed of the landscape architect’s snow-covered corpse lying in a ‘foetal position’ by the side of a country road.

Vincent Tabak, 33, who admits manslaughter but denies murder,  covered his eyes and broke down in tears as dozens of pictures of his victim were revealed on screens.

Jurors, who had been warned of the grim content in advance, were shown 43 separate areas of injury on the 25-year-old victim’s body, including a scratch on her breast and bruising to her neck muscles and wrists, where they were told she had been gripped.

Forensic pathologist Russell Delaney said Miss Yeates died as a result of compression of the neck, adding: ‘She did not die instantaneously. She would have experienced difficulties in breathing and I would have been expecting her at some point to be in pain. I would have expected her to struggle.’

The pathologist added there were ‘injuries to all four quadrants of the neck, front and back, left and right’, which he said indicated the position of the killer’s hands changed during the ‘dynamic’ attack.

Miss Yeates’s parents, who have previously been seated just feet away from the man who has admitted killing their daughter, did not attend court yesterday, as the jury also heard a detailed account of how the body was discovered and then removed from a roadside.

A pair of dog-walkers noticed the ‘lump’ on a grass verge as they led their chocolate labrador along a Somerset country lane early on Christmas morning last year, the court was told. After noticing a patch of denim poking through snow, exposed skin, and the waistband of underwear, they called police and guided officers to the body.

Miss Yeates had been dead for eight days when she was found lying on her right-hand side, parallel to the road with her knees pointing towards a quarry wall, it was said.

As the pictures were shown to Bristol Crown Court, Dutch engineer Tabak, Miss Yeates’s former neighbour, sat next to a female interpreter who helped with translation of scientific terms. He regularly placed his hands across his face, stared at the ground, and removed his spectacles to rub his eyes and cheeks.

In the first series of pictures, Miss 
Yeates’s body was thickly covered in snow and leaf debris and only small
areas of her body were visible. A police forensic officer then 
explained to the court the process by which Miss Yeates’s body was 
removed from the scene, including the use of a broom handle to pass 
straps underneath her so she could be lifted on to a stretcher.  More 
images shown to the court illustrated the progress of post-mortem 
examinations carried out by Dr Delaney later that day.

The positioning of Miss Yeates’s 
clothes were also highlighted,  with her pink T-shirt riding up  her 
torso. She was also wearing jeans which remained fastened.

The court heard there was no evidence to show Miss Yeates had suffered ‘direct sexual violence’.

Pointing out bruising above her right eye and injuries to her nose, Dr Delaney told the court: ‘Bruising only occurs when the heart is beating, so the injuries occurred during life.’

Tabak is said to have ‘squeezed the life’ out of his victim in a ‘desperate’ struggle at her flat in Clifton, Bristol, on December 17 last year before bundling the corpse into his Renault Megane.

The trial continues.
