Forget the wrap dress, one company's answer to a stylish ensemble is more like a wrapper dress.

These quirky designs - from a playing card cocktail dress to a floor-length gown - are put together using a range of recycled rubbish, by company Garbage Gone Glam.

The innovative eco-fashion line is the brainchild of Kristen Alyce, who spends weeks designing and bringing the ideas to life - made with thrown-away drink cartons, leaflets and unwanted concert tickets.

Based in Palm Beach, Florida and New York, the company says that they have thousands of planet-friendly fashionistas queuing up to snap up their designs.

Kristen, 28, says that she began dreaming up bin bag ball gowns while she was in college after becoming irritated with the amount of rubbish she produced and wanted to find a creative outlet for it.

'I realised as a college student living with three girls we created so much waste it was incredible.

Kristen started by making one dress but soon found they were so popular she turned her hand to many more. Pictured: A skirt and tube top made from gym membership brochures

Kristen has began creating dresses for several different clients, here she had made a floor length gown for Hyundai using their brochures and seat belts 

'So I started saving the mass amounts of plastic bags, magazines, boxes and packaging we went through on a daily basis.'

Although Kristen originally began her recycling project as a bit of fun she soon found her designs to be more popular than anticipated.  

'I created the first dress - mainly for fun to test my creativity - out of plastic bags and rolled magazines.

Kristen is concentrating on expanding her line for men which includes jackets, trousers and board shorts. Pictured: (left) A cocktail dress made from playing cards (right) and a men's tie made from a deck

Kristen says that the dresses will last the whole evening and can be kept for many more uses. Pictured: A dress made from Nick's diner menu cards

'People loved it so after years of production assisting and watching shows from the side-lines I created 12 dresses.'

Kristen worked for Couture Fashion Week in New York during college and saw first-hand the impact fashion had on society.

'People go crazy over styles, colours, new looks, vintage looks, gowns, pretty people and gorgeous designs.

Kristen has also created themed dresses such as this festive one for Christmas made from wrapping paper

Kristen says that the vintage design of her dresses appeals to many. Pictured: A bodycon dress made from bandages and plasters 

'As I worked backstage I knew with my background in Fine Art I could find a way to use that same impact to better our planet.'

Kristen has seen her business snowball and now has all kinds of customers lusting after her innovative designs.   

Garbage Gone Glam now has its own online shop with dresses retailing from around $500 (£330) to $1,500 (£990).

Kristen's aim is to create beautiful designs that are more eco-friendly. Pictured: A cocktail dress made from Suero Viv wrappers and bottles 

The dresses may be slightly more expensive than your standard party dress but Kristen says that people aren't put off by the price.

'Now everyone wants a dress - small businesses, larger companies, teenagers, and socialites - all waiting for something they can buy.

'We specialise in cocktail dresses and ball gowns, but we do have a line for men. Ties of all kinds and custom suit jackets, trousers and board shorts.

'The gowns can be worn all night long and kept intact for many uses.'
