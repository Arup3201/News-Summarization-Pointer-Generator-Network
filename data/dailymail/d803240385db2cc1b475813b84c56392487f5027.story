Gareth Southgate has named his 22-man England Under 21 squad for the forthcoming friendly double-header with Portugal and France.

As preparations start in earnest for next summer's European Championships in the Czech Republic - with the draw being made in Prague on Thursday evening - Southgate has named a strong squad with a couple of new faces.

With Saido Berahino promoted to Roy Hodgson's senior squad, Southgate has called upon Bournemouth's Callum Wilson, who has scored nine goals in the Championship so far this season.

There is also a first call-up for Fulham goalkeeper Marcus Bettinelli.

Otherwise, the squad contains many of those who helped England beat Croatia in last month's play-off to qualify for the European finals.

Among them are in-form Tottenham striker Harry Kane, Middlesbrough's loan signing from Chelsea Patrick Bamford and Derby's Will Hughes.
