They have described themselves as the 'Spice Girls' of their day - the 'lily white' Maids of Honour chosen to accompany the Queen on her Coronation Day.

Lady Rosemary Spencer-Churchill, Lady Jane Vane-Tempest-Stewart, Lady Anne Coke, Lady Mary Baillie-Hamilton, Lady Moyra Hamilton and Lady Jane Heathcote-Drummond-Willoughby were chosen for their 'decorative' beauty as well as their ability to carry the Queen's heavy train.

All six were reunited at Westminster Abbey today to celebrate sixty years since that momentous day.

According to Lady Anne Glenconner - then lady Anne Coke -  behind the pomp, preparations for one of the most iconic events in modern history were a joyfully chaotic affair.

The then 20-year-old daughter of the Earl of Leicester, was a vivacious socialite who described the Maids as the 'Spice Girls of our day' and explained each were chosen because of their lineage - the girls had to be the daughter of an Earl, Marquess or Duke - and be unmarried.

'We also had to have a certain type of look and figure. Put it this way, we wouldn't have got picked if we were fat!' she laughed

According to Lady Glenconner there was barely any time to rehearse - and never in the Abbey itself.

'We had a few run-throughs with the Duchess of Norfolk, who actually walked quite differently from the Queen - she walked much faster and we had to really pick up our pace in a hurry when we got to the Abbey. In the end we had just one rehearsal with the Queen at Buckingham Palace, where she wore some kind of curtain wrapped around her waist to mimic her heavy robes,' she recalled.

The night before the Coronation - which was held on June 2 1953 - the capital was so packed that Lady Glenconner had to sleep on a mattress on her great-uncle's floor. 'I don't think many people would have imagined that,' she said.

She added: 'On the morning we had our hair and make-up done because the event was being televised for the first time, but my hair was a disaster.

'I had just had a perm done and they put these heated rollers in my hair. I was frazzled and looked like a sheep and was awfully upset. Fortunately the hairdresser got to work and made me look half decent.

'We dressed at Buckingham Palace. Like the Queen our dresses were by Normal Hartnell, but while they looked exquisite they were the most horribly uncomfortable things to wear and absolutely crushed our ribs. We were told to keep wriggling out toes to try and keep the circulation going.'

Four of the more junior maids, including Lady Glenconner, headed to Westminster Abbey head of the Queen's arrival in the Gold State Coach.

'It was so exciting and we could hear the crowd roaring as the Queen approached. As she alighted we helped her out and smoothed her train. It was really quite cumbersome but had six invisible silk handles stitched into it.

'I must say she looked quite ravishing, the dress was just beautiful. She had such a tiny little waist, wonderful porcelain skin and bright, sparkling eyes.

'She turned to us and said: "Ready, girls?" and with that we were off. We were all a bag of nerves, but she was so calm it made us realised everything would be fine.

'Inside it was so spectacular, the most amazing thing I have ever seen. The colours, the music were just wonderful. Remember we girls had lived through the war, which was just so gloomy. Then we were suddenly transported into this wonderful tapestry that had come to life.

'Unfortunately half way through the service my dress was so tight that I began to faint. Black Rod [a senior officer in the House of Lords] was standing next to me and saw my legs buckle slightly, so held me up. We had smelling salt sewn into our gloves and I crushed my vial and wiggled my feet in an attempt to stay awake.

'Fortunately during the recess the Archbishop of Canterbury came up and offered me a nip of brandy from a flask he had hidden in the Abbey. That did the trick.'

Unlike the pomp and circumstance of the Coronation itself, the reception at Buckingham palace was most definitely a family affair, with the young Prince Charles and Princess Anne running around and hiding under their mother's voluminous dress.

'When people ask you what the best moment of your life was, most say their wedding day. Of course I remember that too. But the Coronation was something exceedingly special. I was so lucky to be a part of it…..the roars, the excitement,' she said.

'After I had stood on the balcony with the Queen I went down to the crowds and listened to them calling for her. There were so many people, you couldn't squeeze a pin between them.'

And later that night there was another, far less decorous celebration. 'My uncle had been asked to chaperone some of the visiting sheiks and I went out to nightclub with them until the early hours!' she recalled.

Asked what she thinks the secret to the Queen's six remarkable decades on the throne is, Lady Glenconner, now 79, who went on to marry Colin Tennant, the 3rd Baron Glenconner, sums it up in one word: duty.

'I often discussed it with her sister, Princess Margaret, for whom I became a lady-in-waiting, and she told me that was what they were brought up to expect. The Queen was raised to give her life to her country,' she said.

She continued: 'The Queen has behaved impeccably over the years and I think people realise that.

'She is actually a very modest  person to be around and I think the celebrations this year and those to come have made people realise what a tremendous debt of thanks we owe her as a nation.

'I remember very distinctly watching her in the Abbey as she was being anointed, she had stripped off her regalia and stood there in her simple white shift. It made her look very vulnerable, a young woman with the weight of her world on her shoulders.

'Then the years of training kicked in. I feel thrilled 60 years later to have played a small part in that remarkable day.'
