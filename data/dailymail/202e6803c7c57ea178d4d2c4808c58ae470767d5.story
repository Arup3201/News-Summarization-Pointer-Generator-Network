An inventive pensioner has come up with a novel way to avoid washing up – by creating an edible spoon.

Roy Webb, 77, believes that his invention will be particularly useful at picnics and parties but that it does have its flaws.

Mr Webb thought of the idea after eating canapés served on small, disposable spoons at a party.

Roy Webb, 77, has created a range of edible spoons that he believes are very useful at picnics and parties

He set about designing an edible product that could hold many picnic favourites, such as pâté, tomatoes, and strawberries.

He made a spoon-shaped cutter and used it to punch out a slice of thick white bread which had been flattened with a rolling pin.

The grandfather placed the shapes onto metal spoon moulds and baked them in the oven for 15 to 20 minutes until they were golden brown.

He then layered them with different toppings including cream cheese, prawns and olives which he ate along with the spoons.

He says that the four inch spoons can also be made from short crust pastry and covered in cream or yoghurt with fruit toppings, or dipped in chocolate and set in the fridge.

Mr Webb, from Cheshire, said the snacks will reduce the amount of plastic cutlery that has to be thrown away after a picnic, as well as cutting out the washing up.

He has now set up his own company selling edible spoon making kits for £25 each from www.ediblespoons.co.uk

Mr Webb, a retired design engineer from Cheshire, said: ‘I have been to various parties and social gatherings where you are served with little assorted starters on ceramic spoons to go with cocktails and drinks.

‘The food was obviously eaten and the spoons where washed after use.

‘I thought why couldn't you make a spoon that can be eaten along with the canapé, it would look just as attractive and would require no extra washing up.

The grandfather placed the shapes onto metal spoon moulds and baked them in the oven for 15 to 20 minutes until they were golden brown

‘So I designed a cutter that would fit the shape of the spoon and started to experiment with various pastries.

‘The problem I found using dough was that to be strong enough to hold a filling it was far too thick, and if it was thinner it was too weak and would not work.

‘After many tests I found that by rolling out bread with a rolling pin the compression of the bread gave it great strength and when baked became the perfect material.

‘I have been getting orders for the kits from all over the world such as Australia, Spain, Canada, Italy, Greece, Saudi Arabia, Egypt, and mostly from America.

‘The feedback has been very flattering.’
