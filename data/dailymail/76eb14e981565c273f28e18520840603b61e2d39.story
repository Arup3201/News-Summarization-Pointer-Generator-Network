Australians who join forces with Islamic State are being used as 'cannon fodder' by militants, the government has warned.

Around a quarter of those who have fled to the Middle East to fight with Islamic State have been killed, as new warnings say that key battlegrounds such as the town of Kobane on the Turkish-Syrian border are fast becoming 'graveyards' for naive foreign fighters.

The Australian reported that five or six Australians have been killed in Kobane in recent weeks, as Attorney General George Brandis revealed those who travel to fight with IS are being misled about their role.

'They (Islamic State) are simply using them as frontline cannon fodder, suicide bombers and propaganda tools,' Senator Brandis told The Australian.  

He also revealed that the death toll for Australian fighters had risen since last count in September by ASIO, one of those being that of ­Mohamed Ali Baryalei - a senior Islamic State recruiter.

'The government is aware of around 20 Australians who have died in the conflict in Syria and Iraq', Senator Brandis said.

The war is fast turning into one of propaganda and publicity, and IS is said to be deliberately exploiting Western recruits by leading them to believe they are crucial to the fight. 

Queensland man Zia Abdul Haq, 33, is  one of the most recent casualties, killed while fighting with IS in October.

Around 90 Australians are believed to be still fighting in the area including Australian-born ginger jihadist Abdullah Elmir who has appeared in two propaganda videos released by Islamic State.

The 17-year-old, who grew up in Bankstown in Sydney's west, is seen in the latest video on the banks of the river Tigris, surrounded by dozens of men dressed in black wielding weapons.

The production, titled An Evening On The Banks Of The Tigris River In The Province Of Nineveh In The Islamic State, is more than six minutes long and shows throngs of militants praying and chanting. 

Mohamed Elomar was a champion boxer before he joined the brutal Islamic State

Elomar gained notoriety after he tweeted pictures of the severed heads of Syrian soldiers.

Professor Greg Barton, from Monash University's Global Terrorism Research Centre, said Elmir was recruited by another wanted terrorist, Mohammad Ali Baryalei, an Australian based in Syria.

He said terror recruiters lured targets by making friends through social media, like many sexual predators.

He said the boy appeared as a 'pawn in the machine' in the first chilling video.

Elmir is not the only Aussie jihadist to have been used for Islamic State publicity.

Sydney friends Mohamed Elomar and Khaled Sharrouf gained notoriety after they tweeted pictures of the severed heads of Syrian soldiers.

Former boxer Elomar, the son of a successful 1970s Lebanese migrant, previously appeared on pay-per-view TV while championing at the combat sport.

This year the 30-year-old’s smiling face was splashed across the news as he held up decapitated heads in Syria and threatened Australia with a terrorist attack.

Sharrouf will be arrested on terrorism-related charges if he ever returns to Australia

Elomar and Sharrouf – who posted a photo on his Twitter account showing his seven-year-old son holding a severed head - are fighting with the al-Qaeda off-shoot and will be arrested on terrorism-related charges if they ever return to Australia.

After one Twitter user told him not to come back, he replied: 'No u idiot injured, dnt worry wouldn't want to go bk u should be more worried about wats coming to australia! [sic]'

Meanwhile, there are also reports that 20 fighters have returned home.

An Australian man who has spent time on the frontline in Syria supported Senator Brandis' comments.

Yehye El Kholed has been on numerous humanitarian trips to the area and warned that Australians were dying for the 'pride' of the leader of Islamic State Abu Bakr al-Baghdadi.

Kholed also echoed the claims that Western fighters were being deliberately misled, saying many militants often do not even know who they're fighting.
