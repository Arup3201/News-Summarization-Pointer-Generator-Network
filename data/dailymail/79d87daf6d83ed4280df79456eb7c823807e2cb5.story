Arrested: Christopher Garret Johnson, 33, walked into the school

A man has been arrested after entering Sandy Hook Elementary - in Virginia - with plank of wood labelled 'high-powered rifle.'

The Strasburg school shares the same name as the Connecticut elementary school where 20 pupils and six adults were killed last Friday.

Christopher Garret Johnson walked 
into the school with a 4-foot long two-by-four labeled 'High Powered 
Rifle about 11:40 a.m. 

Maj. Scott Proctor of the Shenandoah County Sheriff's Office said the 33-year-old was apparently attempting to make a statement about school safety.

He walked into the elementary school in Strasburg about 60 miles west of Washington on Wednesday.

Mr
Proctor said Johnson was immediately detained by a school resource 
officer and arrested by police, who charged him with disorderly conduct,
a misdemeanor.

Johnson is being held without bond in the county jail and said he did not know if Johnson has retained an attorney.

Meanwhile President Barack Obama announced on Wednesday that Vice President Joe Biden will lead an effort to come up with policies to address gun violence amid calls for action following last week's massacre.

The president affirmed the 
constitutional right for Americans to bear arms but clarified when it 
comes to the epidemic of gun violence 'if there is even one thing we can
do to prevent any of these events, we have a deep obligation – all of 
us – to try,' at a White House press conference.

Mr Obama said that Mr Biden will work
with members of his cabinet and other officials to come up with 
proposals by January - assuring the American public this is not merely a
Washington commission to study the issue but promised real reforms in a
timely manner.

'If we are not getting right keeping 
our children safe then nothing else matters,' the president said about 
the need for action and bi-partisan compromise.

The president praised Vice President Biden, who as a former Senator from Delaware led the effort for the 1994 crime bill.

Reminder: The Strasburg school shares the same name as the Connecticut elementary school where 20 pupils were killed last Friday

Biden will work with key cabinet members, reach out to stakeholders and members of Congress to create a list of recommendations for reforms in gun laws, access to mental health care and school safety.

Mr Obama reiterated several times in his comments on Wednesday that Biden's task is not to review or study the issue but to provide action items to the president.

Based on their recommendations, Mr Obama said he will present concrete proposals, as soon as his State of the Union address on January 29.
