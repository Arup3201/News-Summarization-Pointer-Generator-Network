Hundreds 
of suspected militants have been charged with carrying out a wave of 
terrorist attacks in Egypt that killed 40 police officers and 15 
civilians.

The
 country’s chief prosecutor’s office confirmed 200 people had been 
charged in connection with the attacks and with conspiring with al-Qaeda
 and the Palestinian militant group Hamas.

In
 a statement released today, the office said the defendants - 98 of whom
 remain on the run - are all suspected members of the al-Qaeda-inspired Ansar Beit 
al-Maqdis group, also known as the Champions of Jerusalem.

The 
militant group has claimed responsibility for a number of attacks which 
were carried out following the military overthrow of Islamist President 
Mohammed Morsi last summer. 

The prosecutor's statement refers to the 
group as 'the most dangerous terrorist group', and accuses the 
defendants of receiving military training in the Palestinian Gaza Strip 
under the patronage of Hamas, and of travelling to Syria where they took 
part in fighting against government forces there before returning to 
Egypt.

Officials accuse Morsi's Muslim Brotherhood of orchestrating the violence - a charge the group denies.

The
 prosecutors, bringing one of the country's largest terrorism-related 
cases, accuse the defendants of carrying out 51 attacks in recent months and 
receiving training with Hamas in Gaza and in Syria.

The attacks are said to include a bombing
 of the capital's security headquarters in January which killed six 
people, a failed assassination attempt against the interior minister in 
September, and a December attack against the security headquarters in 
the Nile Delta city of Mansoura which killed 16, almost all policemen.

The 200 defendants have also been charged with conspiring with al-Qaeda and the Palestinian militant group Hamas in what is one of the country's largest terrorism-related cases

The attacks also include the assassination of a senior police officer, who was the main investigator and a key witness in one of the trials in which Morsi is the main defendant.

The group, which had originally operated mostly in the restive north Sinai governorate, had claimed responsibility for the attacks.

Since Morsi's ouster, authorities have cracked down heavily on Islamists, arresting thousands and putting hundreds on trial, including Morsi, on charges that include instigating violence and holding illegal protests. Morsi is also accused of conspiring with foreign groups to destabilise Egypt.

The Brotherhood denies the charges and says authorities are seeking to associate them with violence to further undermine the group.

The statement also said the prosecutor's investigation revealed that Morsi, while in office, had negotiated with the group to ensure it abstained from violence during his rule in exchange for a presidential pardon to their colleagues in prison.
