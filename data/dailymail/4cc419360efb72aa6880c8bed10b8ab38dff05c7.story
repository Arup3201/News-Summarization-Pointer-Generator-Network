An Ohio couple is getting a taste of what it's like to be celebrity parents. A photo showing their twins Jenna and Jillian 
holding hands taken shortly after birth May 9 at Akron General Medical 
Center went viral.

The identical twins, born sharing the 
same amniotic sac and placenta, are making progress toward going home 
from the hospital, their parents say.

'It's still been crazy,' father Bill Thistlethwaite said. 'Everywhere we go, someone saw it. People are still talking about it.'

Not the only one! Sarah Thistlethwaite, seen with daughters Jenna and Jillian, delivered her monoamniotic daughters on May 9 at Akron General Medical Center, as well

Father: Bill Thistlethwaite to look lovingly at his new daughter

He said he and his wife, Sarah, were approached by people Saturday while having breakfast at a diner in their hometown of Orrville before going to visit the girls. They want to know how the twins are doing and express their good wishes, he said.

Both girls are taking full bottles and have gained weight, each now at five pounds or more.

Their rare birth condition is called monoamniotic, or 'mono mono,' and doctors say they occur in about one of every 10,000 pregnancies. A second pair born at Akron General the following week also are doing well, hospital spokeswoman Amy Kilgore said.

Jenna was born first at four pounds, two ounces and 17 inches, with Jillian following 48 seconds later at three pounds, 13 ounces and 17.5 inches. They were born at 33 weeks and two days to their 32-year-old mother, a middle school math teacher.

Proud: The Thistlethwaites say the girls are making progress toward going home from the hospital. A photo showing the girls holding hands taken shortly after birth May 9 at Akron General Medical Center has been widely seen on social media, in newspapers and on national TV

They were moved to Akron Children's Hospital after birth because they needed breathing assistance.

If they continue to hit feeding milestones, they are on track to be home in another week or two, just before Father's Day.

Thistlethwaite said he's been scrambling to finish painting their bedroom pink. Their 16-month-old son, Jaxon, has visited the girls and kissed them on the cheeks, his father said.

Thistlethwaite has daydreamed about the time, years in the future, when he and his wife will show the girls their famous baby photo.

'I already feel like they're going to be best friends,' he said. 'They'll probably look at it and say, "That makes sense because that's how we are."'

Jenna and Jillian were delivered by Caesarean section at 2:41pm at Akron General Medical Center, the Akron Beacon Journal reports, and were holding hands when presented to parents Sarah and Bill Thistlethwaite in the delivery room.

'They’re already best friends,' Sarah told the paper. 'I can’t believe they were holding hands. That’s amazing.'

Dr. 
Melissa Mancuso, who delivered the monoamniotic girls along with Dr. 
Katherine Wolfe, told the paper that something like this normally 
'happens in about 1 in 10,000 pregnancies and 1 to 5 per cent of all 
twins.'

Monoamniotic
 twins are the rarest type, Mancuso told the paper, with risks including
 birth defects and tangled umbilical cords that might kill a twin.

Mother Sarah Thistlethwaite, a middle school math teacher, delivered the twins after spending 57 days in bed, according to the Beacon Journal, and her 15-month-old son Jaxon was looked after by family and friends while she waited to give birth.

A hospital press release noted that Sarah, who took leave from her teaching position, was visited by husband Bill every day after work.
