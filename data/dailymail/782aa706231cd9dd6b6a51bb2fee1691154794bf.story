England's young guns secured their place at next year's European Championships with a 2-1 win against Croatia in the second leg of their play-off clash.

Liam Moore gave the visitors the lead before making a mistake to allow Marko Livaja to equalise. But as the hosts pushed for a winner, Derby's Will Hughes sealed victory for the Three Lions with a well-taken goal. 

Here's how Sportsmail rated England's performances.

Jack Butland 7 - Made an excellent early save from close-range inside three minutes before almost being caught out after poor pass gave Croatia the ball. Rushed out for the hosts' equaliser but couldn't have done much more to stop it.

Eric Dier 6 - Doesn't offer the thrust down England's right that Gareth Southgate might like but looked solid defensively and got forward well when given the chance. Relieved to see Croatia miss a good chance after allowing his man to find space in the second half.

Liam Moore 6 - Took his goal with aplomb, sneaking in unmarked and finishing with style into the top corner. Was athletic and strong at the back until getting bullied by Marko Livaja for the equaliser.

Ben Gibson 5.5 - Caught out on a couple of occasions in the opening period and didn't look comfortable when up against the skilful Alen Halilovic. Won a few important headers inside his own box.

Luke Shaw 6 - Not as involved in England's attacking play as he would of liked. Attempted to get forward but his crossing was poor. Dealt with his few defensive duties well.

Will Hughes 7 - Appeared to be carrying a slight injury in the first half but managed to battle through. Not at his creative best but popped up with a classy finish to put England 2-1 ahead. Booked for pulling back Halilovic.

Jake Forster-Caskey 5.5 - Struggled to really impose himself on the game and was guilty of giving the ball away inside his own half a couple of times after the break.

Tom Carroll 6 - His excellent corner caught out the hosts and found Moore's right boot for the opening goal. Quiet at times but sparked into life to provide an excellent chance for Saido Berahino.

Nathan Redmond 7 - The Three Lions' most positive player with the ball at his feet and always looking to beat his man. Won a few free-kicks and attempted to find a killer ball where possible. Taken off late in the game.

Harry Kane 6.5 - Did well to create a chance for himself and test the keeper early on. England's target man from crosses and long balls. Missed a clear-cut chance midway through the second half but worked hard all game.

Saido Berahino 6 - Showed some good hold up play and clever movement but kept hold of the ball for too long at times. Smashed the post after a smart run behind Croatia's defence.
