The weather forecast for this Saturday evening in Wembley is muggy and that is a warning to George Groves on two counts.

This is not the moment for doing anything daft. Nor can he afford to be waylaid.

As Saint George sets out upon the road to redemption there is no scope for another mishap. Certainly not one as calamitous as his starching by Carl Froch.

Reassuringly, he knows it.

In the early part of the build up for this European super-middleweight title challenge to French holder Christopher Rebrasse, Groves talked - whimsically and almost certainly in vain - about a third tilt at world champion Froch despite two stoppages at the hands of the Nottingham Cobra.

He also expanded on his writing of a sit-com and introduced the first recruits to his secondary boxing business as a now-licensed manager.

But now he sounds fully focussed on what should be a routine job at hand, assuming there really are no distractions.

Groves says ‘I’m back on track to win a world title and I’m aware I can’t afford another mistake.’

Groves knows he must beat Rebrasse in order to save his career at the highest level and box for a world title

If any additional incentive were needed for him to rebound from that brutal knock-out inflicted by Froch in the Stadium just across the way from the Arena in which he fights Rebrasse, it comes with the WBC’s confirmation that the winner of this one will become the mandatory challenger for that organisation’s version of the world title. 

And Groves came in just under the 12st super-middleweight limit at 11st 13lb 6oz with Rebrasse weighing slightly more at 11st 13lbs 8oz.

Groves proved adept at manipulating the alpha-belt boxing bodies when cornering Froch into two compulsory IBF belt defences in succession.

Now he has done it again with the WBC, much to the annoyance of their new champion Anthony Dirrell who complains that he is not worthy of the honour.

To which Groves says: ‘Whether he likes it or not - and he sounds scared of me - that’s the way it is and once I’ve beaten Rebrasse I’m coming for him.’

As a lateral thinker and a young multi-tasker, Groves is one of the more interesting personalities of the prize-ring.

But come this Return Of The Saint there is nothing complicated about what must be done to reactivate his career.

Simply, he has to apply his superior ring-craft to a crushing of the fanciful world title aspirations of a moderate opponent.

Expect a mid-fight stoppage.

The Londoner has much to contemplate as he looks to rebuild his boxing reputation on a return to the ring
