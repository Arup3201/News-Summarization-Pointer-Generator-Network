The UK's major network operators have been forced to deny claims the rollout of 4G has had a negative affect on older, 3G services after a string of customer complaints.

Yet a MailOnline investigation has revealed internet services and calls in certain parts of the country have dropped since 4G became more widely available.

It's been a year since EE launched its 4G network in the UK, and just over a month since Vodafone and O2 began rolling out their respective services.

Customers have taken to Twitter to complain that the 4G switch-on has made older services, including 3G internet, calls and texts slower and less reliable, yet mobile operators deny this.

A MailOnline investigation has revealed internet services in some areas of the country have dropped since the rollout of 4G. It's been a year since EE launched its 4G network in the UK, and just over a month since Vodafone and O2 began rolling out their respective services.

A Watchdog investigation was launched in September after a stream of complaints criticised EE's 4G service. 

They ranged from complaints about internet speeds to a rise in call failures and overall poor service.

It discovered that at times operators may suggest to customers that when they're having trouble with their 4G service, they should switch down to 3G temporarily.

However, this may put the 3G network under too much strain and affect the performance of this slower speed, as well.

EE apologised to customers if they had suffered poor service but denied there was was an overreaching problem:

'It is entirely correct that when a 4G user makes a Voice call the call is currently passed through the 3G network - most importantly, there is no negative experience for customers caused by this.'

One O2 customer explained to MailOnline how he streams videos on the train on his way home from work in London.

He used to be able to stream a football TV show on his Google Nexus 4 on his homebound journey but now the signal drops 'regularly' and it has become 'impossible to watch.'

'If I try to stream a video, or open sites with pictures on, the internet grinds to a halt.

'I never used to have any problems and I haven't changed my route home, or my phone - it's frustratingly poor,' he said.

'I'm sure it has something to do with 4G launching in London. It's too much of a coincidence not to be and other people I know have complained about similar problems.'

Tom Reynolds on Twitter added he has noticed a difference since the 4G switch-on: 'On 3G, sometimes Twitter, Facebook and internet is slower than usual.' Although adds that this may be due to his handset.

While Sarah Aldridge tweeted hers has been more 'rubbish than usual.'

When asked for comment, Vodafone denied its network had been affected and told MailOnline: 'We’ve checked with our technical teams and there have been no unusual activity on our 3G network. 

Customers have taken to Twitter to complain the 4G switch-on has made older services, including 3G internet, calls and texts slower and less reliable, yet mobile operators including O2 and Vodafone deny this. O2's CEO Ronan Dunne believes 4G investment will boost 2G and 3G services

'Our 4G service works on a different part of the airwaves than our 3G and 2G services, so there is no knock on effect for our existing customers. 

'We are currently upgrading sites across the country every day to install 4G and to improve existing 2G/3G coverage. 

'If readers are complaining about an issue in a specific area, can you please ask them the postcode of the area in which they experienced it and we can investigate.'

An O2 spokesman similarly added: 'We’ve spent a number of months getting ready for 4G and carried out rigorous testing to ensure our 3G service isn’t impacted by 4G. 

'This will continue as we roll out 4G, improving our depth of coverage and focus on delivering a great network experience for all our customers.'

Wireless coverage mapping experts 
Root Metrics let users compare the signal strength and coverage of 
different networks across the UK.

It produces reports that compare the internet speeds, reliability of calls and texts of various providers.

In Bristol, used as an example, the 
top four providers in July 2013, in terms of internet speeds, were EE, 
with a score of 109, Three with a score of 80, O2 with 70 and Vodafone 
on 54 (see chart above.)

Call reliability in the same month 
showed Vodafone had the most call failures (3.4 per cent), Three was in 
second at 1.9 per cent, EE suffered 1.5 per cent call dropouts and O2 
was on 1.2 per cent.

When this is compared to the same 
report compiled this month (see chart above) - after Vodafone and O2 have begun 
rolling out 4G across the country in addition to the EE service - every single operator dropped 
internet speed points.

The drops were marginal but EE scored
106, down three points, Three was on 78.9, O2 dropped 0.2 points to 
69.8 and Vodafone lost almost ten points to 44.9. 

There was also a rise in the number of call failures across three of the four networks. Vodafone dropped calls 3.8 per cent 
of the time, Three was second again at 2.8 per cent. EE had 1.6 per cent
call failures, while O2 stayed the same.

Although it is unclear what the 
causes for these drops were - and the drops are specific to the Bristol 
region meaning it might not be the case nationwide - the figures do indicate services have been adversely 
affected in recent months.

Figures in Leeds and Bradford, London and Cardiff showed a similar decline in certain services.

In response to a tweet by The Telegraph asking whether anyone had experienced problems, WG Grut admitted: '3G has definitely got noticeably slower on O2 since 4G launch,' and Ayres the Baker added: ' I won't be signing up to 4G until they can demonstrate its reliable. 3G is most certainly not at the moment!'

A Watchdog report was launched recently after a stream of complaints criticised EE's 4G service. They ranged from complaints about internet speeds to a rise in call failures and overall poor service

O2's CEO Ronan Dunne tweeted: 'On average 3G speeds are higher - dual band devices and HSPA+. Offset in part by growth in traffic - new spectrum helps this.

'The investment in 4G will improve the 2G and 3G experience as well.'

Commenting on the news, Oliver Folkard, mobiles expert at uSwitch.com told MailOnline: 'The rumour-mill may well prove to have legs but, for now at least, it's too early to tell if the launch of 4G is impacting 3G speeds.

'Ofcom is busily collecting 3G speeds data and, once Three has launched its 4G service too at the end of this year, we may see more than just anecdotal evidence that this is happening.

'There have been some concerns that T-Mobile and Orange customers would suffer as the spectrum they used for 3G was squeezed by EE launching 4G last October, but again there is no evidence for this yet.'

EE, and other experts are also quick to point out that the 4G and 3G spectrums run on different frequencies, so it's unlikely one would directly affect the other.

Twitter user Feef said: In the UK, at the moment, 4G is on a different frequency from 3G.

Variations will be down to the telco, not the band.'

EE and Three are yet to respond to a request for comment.

EE, which was formed from the merger of Orange and T-Mobile, was the first company to offer a 4G network in the UK.

EE
held the monopoly on the network because regulator Ofcom gave it 
permission to use existing spectrum (1800MHz) that it already owned.

Ofcom then held an auction for companies to bid to use other parts of the spectrum from 800MhZ to 2.6GHz. O2 purchased 800MHz lots and Vodafone won both 800MHz and 2.6GHz lots.

For
the typical user, download speeds of initial 4G networks should be at 
least five to seven times faster than those of existing 3G networks.

In
July, EE announced it was doubling its 4G speeds for people in 
Birmingham, Bristol, Cardiff, Derby, Edinburgh, Glasgow, Leeds, 
Liverpool, London, Manchester, Nottingham and Sheffield.

The speed boost makes the network twice as fast as current average 4G speeds and 10 times as fast as 3G.

Mobile
network Three has kicked off a price war earlier this week over the new
4G service by announcing it will offer the super high-speed internet at
no extra cost.

The firm’s 
1.5million customers will get 4G at the same price they pay for the 
current 3G network, with packages of calls, texts and unlimited internet
from £15 a month. 

The Three deal will start in mid December, cashing in on Christmas handset sales.
