Several homes including Ms Tatarnikova's have completely vanished into the hole.

'I was watching TV and then it started flickering and the lights started swinging. I opened the front door and saw a massive pit appearing in the ground,' she said.

'I ran back into the house and grabbed my son Kiril out of his cot and ran out through the back door. Seconds later the entire house disappeared into the hole.

'I still can't believe that I have 
lost everything. I don't have any of the official paperwork from my 
passport through to my son's hospital documents, with his toys and all 
our clothes. Everything is gone.'

She
 said local officials had promised to help with rehousing and covering 
the loss of everything, but so far nothing had happened.

A cloud of dust covers the hole. 'I ran back into the house and grabbed my son Kiril out of his cot and ran out through the back door. Seconds later the entire house disappeared into the hole,' she said

She said: 'I am really in shock about the whole thing.'

So far managers of the Kazzinca mining company that runs the nearby LLP Altyn Tau East mine have declined to comment on the disaster.

The pit at the moment appears to have stabilised having grown to a width of 70 metres and with a depth of 30 metres.
