However much they whisper in the shadows about his future as Rangers manager, Ally McCoist’s reputation as a true survivor remains intact.

In the week in which the city’s rumour mongers have been working overtime, what was already another stern test of his credentials seemed to take on new proportions.

The slender victory, courtesy of Lewis MacLeod’s flashing header four minutes from time, is unlikely to see McCoist handed a fresh long-term deal by new powerbroker Mike Ashley by the time the week is out — but nor will it do him any harm, either.

As winter grips, McCoist can now point to a League Cup semi-final in three months’ time as further evidence of tangible progress under him. Celtic may even lie in store.

With his side now up to five wins on the spin since losing at home to Hibs in the Championship, he is at least in a better place than this time last month. Not for the first time, his timing might just prove to be impeccable.

In front of a paltry crowd and under the watchful eye of Ashley’s right-hand man Derek Llambias, McCoist’s team were not at their best. They did not have to be.

Tommy Wright’s St Johnstone looked for all the world like a team who believed they were facing the Rangers of 10 years ago. They gave far too much respect to their opponents and could have little complaint that their dream of adding the League Cup to the Scottish Cup they won in May is at an end.

As a player with the club in the barren days of the early 80s, McCoist would have occasionally experienced Ibrox when populated by sparse crowds.

Even allowing for the TV coverage, apathy and what is seemingly an ongoing unofficial fans boycott, last night’s attendance of 13,023 was truly startling. As the team’s emerged, you had to remind yourself this was a League Cup quarter-final tie. And one at the start of a new chapter for Rangers at that.

There had certainly been precious little to encourage the home fans on such occasions since liquidation in 2012. Of the five subsequent matches against teams from higher divisions, Rangers had won just two.

Saints scarcely arrived with a bullish mind-set, though. Wright’s men had been more than happy to leave Partick with a point at the weekend having stopped the rot of five straight league losses.

They started brightly enough. Brian Graham ran off the effects of a late Ian Black clogging to fire a yard past Steve Simonsen’s goal from 20 yards.

Michael O’Halloran, selected ahead of James McFadden, bounded towards the by-line and picked out the darting figure of Simon Lappin. Only the diligence of Richard Foster prevented a certain goal.

The early exchanges were worthy of a wider audience. Fraser Aird’s cross from the right presented Kenny Miller with a difficult chance and the veteran’s ambitious scissor-kick never threatened Alan Mannus.

When Lewis Macleod combined pace on the turn with precision passing on the half-way line, Kris Boyd was left a free run at the visitors’ goal. Mannus spread himself well to block although the striker ought to have done better.

Saints’ were forced into a rethink midway through the first period when Murray Davidson was stretchered off following an accidental clash with Lee McCulloch. Gary McDonald was sprung from the bench.

Often Rangers’ killer instinct was not what it might have been. When O’Halloran played Steven Anderson into trouble, Aird had a host of options both left and right yet was calmly dispossessed by Brian Easton.

There was little to choose between the sides in the opening period yet, by virtue of their stronger finish, St Johnstone were left nursing the greater sense of grievance.

Lee Wallace sold Macleod short with a ball out from the back. Lee Croft leapt upon it and having ghosted to the byline saw Frazer Wright out of the corner of his eye. The defender rose well to connect yet, to his manager’s chagrin, failed to direct his header on target.

O’Halloran was relishing his floating role and when he produced another excellent delivery from the right, only Foster stood between Graham and a likely opening goal.

Chris Millar’s expertly-controlled volley gave Simonsen food for thought on the cusp of half-time but the breakthrough proved elusive.

Boyd was threatening one of those nights. When Macleod’s incisive pass picked him out seconds after the turnaround, he looked odds-on to score only for Easton to block.

St Johnstone were equally as profligate. Having shown Foster a clean pair of heels, O’Halloran opted to go for goal rather than square for Graham. Simonsen’s outstretched arm maintained parity.

It was to prove the keeper’s final involvement of the night. Simon Lappin’s in-swinging free-kick was guided towards the bottom corner by Graham. Simonsen saved well yet could not prevent himself colliding with the post at full pelt. As he was stretchered off, Lee Robinson was brought on for his first Rangers’ appearance in eight years.

His first involvement was almost calamitous. With no need to leave his line, he dashed to meet O’Halloran close to the right touchline. Having lost the race, his relief at seeing the Saints man stumble and lose his footing with a clear sight of goal was considerable.

Despite the tiring legs on both sides, openings proved to be more at a premium the longer the game wore on.

Lee McCulloch did manage to succeed in finding the net with 10 minutes remaining with an impressive headed conversion of Macleod’s free-kick but the veteran was adjudged to have strayed offside.

But just as the spectre of extra-time loomed large, Rangers struck. Aird’s crossing had been erratic all night but with four minutes left he produced a peach.

Cutting back on to his favoured right foot, he whipped an in-swinger over the visiting defence. Macleod rose, connected sweetly and the tie was as good as over.

Black almost made it two with a raking drive from 25 yards that Mannus tipped over but the solitary goal was sufficient.
