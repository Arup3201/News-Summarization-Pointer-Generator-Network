A family lost their Jack Russell terrier in a house fire sparked by sun rays shining a Nutella jar.

Investigators believe the blaze - which gutted an entire bedroom - started when low winter sunlight was refracted by the glass jar on a window sill.

It is thought the rays were magnified by the jar, which was being used to store loom bands, and beamed onto nearby blinds, causing them to catch fire. 

A family lost their Jack Russell terrier after a large house fire was sparked by sun rays shining a Nutella jar

The blaze gutted an entire bedroom on the first floor of the property in Twickenham, south west London

There was also damage to the roof after the fire started on February 15 while the family were out

The family were not home at the time but their pet, named Chili, was trapped inside the house in Twickenham, south west London, and died.

Declan Murphy said he was out celebrating his anniversary with wife Lindsay and their two children at the time of the blaze. 

He told Get West London they were 'heartbroken' at the death of the dog, adding: 'We've been told it will be up to a year before the house is ready for us to move back into.'

The electrical supervisor, 41, added: 'I want to ensure other people are aware of the dangers and know to keep glass items away from windows and out of direct sunlight so they don't have to go through anything like this.

The fire, on February 15, destroyed a bedroom on the first floor and the roof was also damaged.

Charlie Pugsley, of London Fire Brigade, warned people to make sure their window ledges are clear before leaving home.

He said: 'It sounds far fetched that a jar containing a few rubber bands caused a severe house fire but that's exactly what happened.

'It's worth spending five minutes checking that your window ledges are clear of any glass or crystal that might lead to a potentially life changing blaze.'

Last week, lingerie tycoon Michelle Mone told how a fire broke out at her home in similar circumstances.

She wrote on Twitter: 'OMG sun coming through the window, bean bag next to mirror table...bean bag has just gone on fire. Incredible how a house fire can start.'

Ms Mone put the fire out herself and firefighters did not attend.

Sun rays have caused 125 fires in the last five years, according to the London Fire Brigade, and warned they are a risk in the winter as well as the summer.

Mr Pugsley added the figures show that these sorts of incidents are 'not an urban myth'.
