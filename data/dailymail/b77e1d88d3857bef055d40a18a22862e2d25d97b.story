Angry: Media baron Richard Desmond last night announced he was taking immediate steps to terminate his involvement with the Irish Daily Star after it became the second publication to print topless photographs of the Duchess of Cambridge

Media baron Richard Desmond last night announced he was taking immediate steps to terminate his involvement with the Irish Daily Star after it became the second publication to print topless photographs  of the Duchess of Cambridge.

The chairman of Northern & Shell, which co-owns the newspaper with Dublin-based Independent News & Media, said he was ‘profoundly dismayed’ at the decision, which was taken without his knowledge.

The intervention by the multi-millionaire  – who owns British newspapers the Daily Express and Daily Star – came as St James’s Palace reacted with fury to the news, saying: ‘There can be no motivation for this action other than greed.’

A source close to Mr Desmond said last night: ‘When he found out what had been printed he was absolutely astonished. Immediate steps were taken to establish  who had made the decision, which all the company absolutely disagrees with.

‘Northern & Shell will now seek to have no further involvement with the joint venture that produces the newspaper.’

Insiders confirmed that the Irish Daily Star would face an uncertain future  without Mr Desmond’s backing, although Independent News & Media is expected to continue to support the title.

The source added: ‘The decision to terminate the contract stems from a  personal belief about what is right and wrong, it’s that simple.’

Michael O’Kane, editor of the Irish Daily Star, sought to defend his decision as his future looked increasingly in doubt.

Irish Daily Star Editor Mike O'Kane defended his decision to publish the photos calling them 'very tasteful'

‘The Duchess would be no different to any other celeb pics we would get in, for example Rihanna or Lady Gaga,’ he said.

‘She’s not the future queen of Ireland 
so the only place this is causing fury seems  to be in the UK, and they 
are very, very tasteful pictures.’

A statement issued on behalf of Mr Desmond said: ‘We abhor the decision  of the Irish Daily Star to publish these intrusive pictures, which we believe to  be a grotesque invasion of their privacy.

‘Northern & Shell is profoundly dismayed at the decision, which would never have been made by any of the newspapers or magazines under our editorial control.’

Last night, Labour MP Steve Rotheram, a member of the Commons’ culture, media and sport committee, said: ‘Publishing these pictures in Ireland was totally unacceptable.

‘Newspaper owners should act responsibly. Desmond may say he didn’t know about all this but is it right for such a proprietor to continue to own a British newspaper after this? I’m not convinced it is.’
