Challenging: Police and Crime Commissioner for Cheshire John Dwyer said that officers were lucky they were 'not working for HMV'

A police chief has angered officers facing wage cuts by telling them they were fortunate 'not to work for HMV'.

John Dwyer was attempting to defend plans to slash starting salaries for constables by £4,000 when he made the quip about the administration-hit music retailer.

Mr Dwyer, the Police and Crime Commissioner for Cheshire, and a former Assistant Chief Constable, had been asked if the planned wage cuts meant that officers were being undervalued.

'Every day you face new challenges 
and I think that's the attraction to the job and it's why I don't think a
reduction in pay will actually reduce the number of applications,' he 
told BBC Radio Merseyside.

'We've got to understand we're in very tight times and at least we're not working for HMV, are we?

'Our officers still have a job.'

The
Police Federation has already said that the proposed cuts will fail to 
reflect the dangers of policing roles because a new recruit will receive
a salary of £19,000, which is less than a trainee manager at fast food 
chain McDonald's.

Mr 
Dwyer's words have provoked anger from police supporters, including 
Labour councillor John Stockton, who was beaten by Conservative Mr Dwyer
in last November's Police and Crime Commissioner elections.

Mr
Stockton labelled Mr Dwyer's comments as "outrageous" and said that the
62-year-old should have thought about how his comments would have been 
received by any police officers who had been listening.

"This
will only serve to further undermine the morale of an already stretched
service," Mr Stockton told the Daily Star newspaper.

Struggling high street stalwart HMV 
announced on Monday that it was calling in administrators Deloitte after
a dismal Christmas sales period, contributed to the chain's debts of 
more than £250 million.

Around 4,350 staff at HMV's stores in the UK and in Ireland face losing their jobs.

However,
retailer Game, which itself exited administration in April of last 
year, has revealed that it has expressed an interest in buying some of 
the HMV stores.

Since the New Year, camera chain Jessops and Blockbusters have already gone under.

Deloitte,
which is also dealing with Blockbusters, said that the DVD rental chain
would close 129 stores of it's 528 branches, with 760 staff at risk of 
redundancy.

It had already given 31 stores notice of closure.

Jessops
has already closed each of its 187 shops, and staff at the retailer's 
head office in Leicester are also likely to lose their jobs.
