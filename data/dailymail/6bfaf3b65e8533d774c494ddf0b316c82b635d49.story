Tennis fans eager to capture a selfie at the Australian Open have been warned against using selfie sticks courtside - but the message hasn't sunk in with the players themselves.

Organisers are discouraging people visiting Melbourne Park against using the controversial stick to take snaps during matches over fears it could block other competition goers’ views.

Tennis Australia say that the sticks have not been banned but they have ‘asked for people to use their discretion and use them sensibly’.

But stars such as Maria Sharapova and Novak Djokovic don't seem to mind at all - with the Russian star posting a hilarious selfie with her shy boyfriend, and the Serbian men's favourite happily posing with fans.

A spokeswoman told Daily Mail Australia: ‘We made the decision not to ban them because we think people will be happy to use them responsibly.

‘People love them and many people got them for Christmas, they are a big novelty and we don’t’ want to stop people using them.’

Organisers are most concerned about the sticks distracting fans and players during matches.

They have requested people ‘don’t use them in and around the courts when you might be affecting people's views… so don’t use them during in a match… it’s working very well so far,’ the spokesperson said.

As part of the Australian Open’s social media plan, 20 dedicated selfie zones have been set up around the Park.

‘The selfie zone idea was more of a call to action rather than telling people where they should take their photos,’ Tennis Australia said.
