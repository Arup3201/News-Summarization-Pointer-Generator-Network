In the future, your phone will know your everyday activities so well, it will automatically realise when it has been stolen.

That’s the thinking behind the latest software developed by Glasgow researchers.

By combining data from various sensors in the phone, the app  knows when it is being used by an unfamiliar person, or taken to an unknown location. 

It then asks for an authentication code before being unlocked.

The software was created by Glasgow Caledonian University and uses phone sensors to build a profile of the user’s behaviour. For example, it tracks which apps they use on daily basis, uses Wi-Fi sensors to learn which networks are typically within that user’s vicinity, as well as how they typically hold a device

‘Mobile devices such as smartphones and tablets are rapidly becoming our digital identity,’ explained Professor Just and his colleagues from Glasgow Caledonian University in their ‘Data Driven Authentication: On the Effectiveness of User Behaviour Modelling with Mobile Device Sensors’ paper.

‘They are used for payments and authentication, and they store valuable information.

The software uses sensors in phones to build a profile of the user.

For example, it tracks which apps they use on daily basis. 

It also uses Wi-Fi sensors to learn which networks are typically within that user’s vicinity on a daily or weekly basis, as well as which mobile towers they travel near.

The accelerometer can even determine how a user typically holds a device.

In addition, the phone uses sensors to learn about a user's environments, such as how light their home is, or how noisy their office is.

The data from all these available sensors are combined to create a 'comfort score.'

If the location is unknown, or sensor data has never been encountered, the score is zero.

If comfort levels drop below 0.2, suggesting  the behaviours are out of the ordinary, the device will ask for an authentication code to unlock. 

‘Their relatively low cost, ease of use and ‘always on’ connectivity provides a suitable platform for many day-to-day tasks involving money and sensitive data, which in turn makes mobile devices an attractive attack target.’

The software uses the sensors built into phones to build a profile of the user.

For example, it tracks which apps they use on a daily basis, and if there are any patterns in terms of which order they are opened in, or how long they use them.

It also uses Wi-Fi sensors to learn which networks are typically within that user’s vicinity on a daily or weekly basis, as well as which mobile towers they travel near.

The accelerometer can even determine how a user typically holds a device.

In addition, the phone uses sensors to learn about the user's environments, such as how light their home is, or how noisy their office is.

The data from all these available sensors were combined to create a so-called comfort score based on its frequency for the given time and location.

If the location is unknown, or the sensor data has never been encountered for that location, the comfort score is zero.

And because some sensors provide more than one input, such as noise and light, the readings were used more than once.

The data from all these available sensors were combined to create a so-called comfort score based on its frequency for the given time and location. Pictured are three individual usage patterns for researchers involved in the study

If comfort levels drop below 0.2, suggesting the behaviours are out of the ordinary, the device asks for an authentication code to unlock

After the software has learnt the user’s behaviours, it initiates ‘deployment mode’, and the device automatically sets a detection threshold to be 0.2.

This means that if comfort levels drops below 0.2, suggesting the behaviours are out of the ordinary, the device will ask for an authentication code to unlock.

This can be different to the user’s PIN, and unique to that user and device.

The software is adaptive enough to recognise that small deviations from normal behaviour is expected, but larger changes will trigger a response.

During four separate tests, the comfort level dropped substantially below the owner’s average and there was a detection rate of 95 per cent.

The only exception was when a friend or family-member, known as an ‘informed insider’ used the device.

Professor Just explained that it takes a week, on average, for the software to learn its user’s activity.

The software will undergo further tests before it can be released more widely to consumers.
