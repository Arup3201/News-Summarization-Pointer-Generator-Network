Observation cars with glass walls, deluxe suites and a sleek design - this is the future of train travel in Japan.

Cruise Train is expected to launch in the spring of 2017, but renderings have been released, unveiling a revolutionary blueprint with a £30m price tag.

Produced by Ferrari designer Ken Okuyama in collaboration with JR East railways, the projections are based on the seven-star super-luxury Nanatsuboshi in Japan.

The new-look 34-passenger vessel will boast 10 carriages - including two observation areas, with glass walls so that passengers can enjoy the moving landscape.

As well as being able to see out of a window at the very front of the train - so the track is visible - passengers will also be able to relax on comfortable, sofa-style seating.

It will also feature a two-storey deluxe suite car, complete with two beds on the lower floor, a private bathroom, and a lounge area upstairs.

The Cruise Train, with its high ceilings, will also have five further guest sleeper carriages.

And it will feature an EDC system, allowing it to run on both electric and non-electric rails.

Although the price of travelling on the new super-luxury train has not been announced, designer Okuyama said the locomotive 'lets passengers enjoy the flow of time and space.'
