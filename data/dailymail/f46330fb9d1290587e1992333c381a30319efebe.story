Flagship brand: Barr’s other brands, including Rubicon, Tizer and Strathmore Water, are also expected to have achieved resilient performances

According to the hugely successful advertising campaign, it is a drink made in Scotland from girders.

But Irn-Bru maker AG Barr has seen sales soar in the past year, mainly thanks to a new production plant in England which has helped it crack the UK market.

The facility opened in Milton Keynes, Buckinghamshire, last year to help accelerate a sales drive south of the Border.

Now the company is expected to reveal that sales have risen by 5.6 per cent to around £135million after seeing a big increase in popularity among consumers in England.

Barr, which saw rival Britvic pull the plug on a proposed £1.9billion merger last year following a Competition Commission inquiry, is expected to cite the growth as a platform for further expansion in southern England.

The factory in Milton Keynes was not open in the first half of last year and the group said in a summer trading update that sales were likely to have grown 5.6 per cent to about £135million.

AG Barr has expanded beyond its core Scottish customer base in the past four years, with England and Wales now chipping in more than half of group sales.

The drinks maker said in May it was to invest a further £4million in the Milton Keynes site and confirmed plans to close its Tredegar carton-making factory in Wales, with the loss of 67 jobs.

Barr’s other brands, including Rubicon, Tizer and Strathmore Water, are also expected to have achieved resilient performances when chief executive Roger White reports the firm’s trading figures tomorrow.

City analysts believe falling commodity prices should help underpin the company’s further growth, with input prices expected to be lower next year, especially for the crucial component, sugar.

Charles Pick, drinks analyst at Numis Securities, forecasts interim pre-tax profits of £17.8million at Barr compared with £16.6million last time.

The City consensus for annual profits at the group to January 2015 is £41.6million.

Chris Wickham, analyst at Oriel Securities, said: ‘The group remains on track to deliver organic growth.

‘In particular, the group’s flagship Irn-Bru brand continues to grow share by expanding southwards.’

Scotland’s ‘other national drink’ was invented in 1901 by Andrew Greig Barr.

Only two people know the 32 secret ingredients used to make the drink, including Robin Barr, 74, who stood down as chairman of the firm in 2009 after 31 years.
