Ron Vlaar's agent has hinted the defender is ready to quit Aston Villa in the summer when his contract expires and insists no talks have taken place over a new deal.

The Holland international says he is committed to the Villa cause but, like Tottenham target Fabian Delph, is preferring to keep his options open about where his future lies.

Vlaar's agent Arnold Oosterveer confirmed that Southampton showed interest last summer but that he opted to stay at Villa Park for one more season.

Oosterveer would not be drawn on interest from Manchester United and Arsenal but said: 'We have not spoken to Aston Villa, the club have not requested talks with us.

'The ball is with Aston Villa. Ron is in a situation which is not unfavourable. We are in no hurry.

Vlaar caught the eye with impressive performances for Holland at the World Cup in Brazil

'I don't want to respond [to rumours about Arsenal and Manchester United], but the natural break for Ron is now and it's the time to take a nice step. He is ambitious.' 

Talking to Voetbal International, he added: 'Last summer, Southampton were interested in Ron. But we asked ourselves whether that club would be a step forward compared to Aston Villa. Now that club are suddenly second, so things can happen quickly.'

Vlaar gave Villa a scare last night when he was forced off with a calf injury during the first half of Holland's friendly with Mexico.

The 29-year-old missed four Premier League matches, against Liverpool, Arsenal, Manchester City and Chelsea, with a calf problem earlier in the season but returned to captain the side in their last four games.
