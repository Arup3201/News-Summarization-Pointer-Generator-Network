The FA are in a stand-off with politicians over releasing sensitive information from secret files into the doomed 2018 England World Cup bid.

Former Minister of Sport Gerry Sutcliffe revealed that the FA had ‘reluctantly’ agreed to show some members of the Department of Culture, Media, Sport select committee the dossier of documents which British intelligence services help to compile.

And former FA chairman Lord Triesman said the MPs would be the ‘rightful judges’ of the hidden cache of material - much of it rumour, hearsay and innuendo rather than hard facts.

The FA want guarantees of confidentiality plus notice of what the select committee members intend to do with documents, containing mainly unsubstantiated information, before handing them over. They want to avoid costly legal action such as Lord Triesman still faces from abroad after making allegations about World Cup bid corruption under parliamentary privilege.

Detail from those secret files that could be properly corroborated have already been handed over to FIFA investigator Michael Garcia.

England head coach Stuart Lancaster wants the Millennium Stadium roof kept open for the titanic Six Nations opener against Wales in Cardiff on Friday night. In contrast, the roof will be closed for all eight Rugby World Cup games there in the autumn to ensure a level playing field for all teams.

Trefor Lloyd Hughes, president of the Welsh FA, is adamant about a gentlemen’s agreement between the Home Nations, in place from 2011, that the British vice-presidency on the FIFA ExCo should rotate and it is Wales’s turn after Jim Boyce, of Northern Ireland, steps down in May. However, Lloyd Hughes cannot count on the support of the FA of Wales on this issue. They, like the FA who have put up David Gill as a candidate, believe that any such verbal contract was dissolved when new UEFA statutes were introduced which have all 54 European countries voting on the next British representative rather than just the Home Nations.

BBC Sport can’t use the excuse of being strapped for cash after it emerged they put in a losing bid of £10million-a-year for the five-year Open golf contract. That gives them a £50m war chest to invest in another rights property — probably best spent shoring up their precious hold on Six Nations rugby who will accept pay-TV bids in the next tender from 2018.

Testing times for KP

The BBC signing Kevin Pietersen as a Test Match Special World Cup pundit looks fraught with problems with arch-enemy Graeme Swann also on the TMS team and cricket correspondent Jonathan Agnew having had spats with KP.

However, it’s understood Pietersen will not be scheduled to do the same games as Swann after being loaned to TMS by Fox TV — who made the approach — for short commentary spells from the quarter-finals onwards.

Swann described Pietersen’s autobiography as ‘the biggest work of fiction since Jules Verne’.

TMS producer Adam Mountford is known to have checked with Agnew before agreeing to the Pietersen offer. Agnew had resigned from Twitter temporarily last October after a social media row with Pietersen’s wife Jessica Taylor in the fall-out from the publication of KP’s life story. But Aggers is said to be relaxed at having KP briefly as a TMS colleague.

Such is the chaos within the England Cricket Board during a mass culling of personnel - especially those aged more than 50 - that new chief executive Tom Harrison has had to start work at Lord’s with an acting, acting director of communications in Steve Elworthy because the current acting comms chief Phil French is on paternity leave.

It’s almost a year since David Beckham announced his Major League Soccer franchise in Miami — but there’s still no stadium site in place, or much other progress, it seems.

However, the Beckham camp are still confident they will have a set of partners, a ground - likely to be at Miami’s renovated Sun Life Stadium at first - and a name for the team by the end of March. The project is currently called Miami Beckham United but there’s no chance of Beckham’s name being included in the official MLS team name.
