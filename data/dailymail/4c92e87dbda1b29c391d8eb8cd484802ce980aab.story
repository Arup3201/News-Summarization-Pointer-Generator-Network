A French photographer has become more involved in his art by drawing himself into his pictures.

Sebastien Del Grosso uses a 'dodge and burn' effect to create brush strokes that make his photographs look more like a painting.

He does this to make his artwork 'more pleasant to the eye' and to introduce an imaginative element to photography.

Sebastien combined his two passions of drawing and photography to make an eye-catching form of art

The artists wanted to create something a little out of the ordinary when he used photography techniques in a painterly style

Sebastien, 32, said: 'Drawing has always been my passion, but after discovering photography, I thought the combination of my two passions would allow me to do something a little out of the ordinary. 

'The pictures are very personal and give free rein to my imagination.'

The graphic designer, from France, has created two series of his work.

The first, titled 'the sketch of life' illustrates Sebastien's life with the intervention of people who are close to him or events that have been important to him, with something a little more humorous.

The second, named 'Friend Sketch' sees 
Sebastien work with a team of people, named 'Je Shoote Raw' contains a 
number of portraits from his photography team, where he shows the 
process of some of his images.

The unique use of line brings a comic-book element to his photographs

Sebastien included the people who meant the most to him in his series of photographs, including both family and friends

'I have included people who are important to me, such as my grandmother who taught me to draw,' said Sebastien.

'But I have also included a couple of humorous images such as the 'sketch and fight' picture which shows the battle of two artists - myself and my friend Cal Redback' - each with our own technique.'

Sebastien created the pictures in his apartment, using a Canon 7D, a 50mm and simple lighting.

From the shooting to the final image, it can take Sebastien a few hours to several days to complete.

'I find it's good to take a break when I'm creating these images,' he said. 'It suddenly brings a new look, and I can find mistakes that I didn't necessarily notice before.

The trickiest part of these images is the presence of the sketch in the photo as it has to look realistic and balanced

The images are complicated to create and it can take up to a few days to complete just one piece

Sebastien aims to utilise the best elements of paint and photography to create a whole new level of portraiture

'The trickiest part of these images is the presence of the sketch in the photo as it has to look realistic and balanced.

'You can show 'enough' but not too much either. It also requires the position of the drawings matched with the placement of the pencil on the picture, to bring some life.'

Sebastien takes his inspiration from artist Ben Heine.

He said: 'I've always been a huge fan of his work, which is associated with drawing and photography.

'Unlike mine, his universe is rather imaginary. 

'In my series, I try to present things in a realistic way, as if my sketches have given birth to reality.'
