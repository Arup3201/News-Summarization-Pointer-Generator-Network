One man claims that the remains of approximately 1200 British soldiers and Mohawk allies may lie under a covered ravine in upstate New York.

Randy Patten, a 61-year-old retired 
state police investigator and former member of a New York commission that celebrated the 250th anniversary of the French and Indian War, says a local businessman 'is dumping on historical ground, or what’s left of it, anyway.'

In the 1990s, businessman Anthony Tomasovic was granted permission by the town of Lake George to fill in his vacant, sloping property. The land borders the wooded ravine where about 1,000 British Colonial troops and 200 of their Mohawk Indian allies were ambushed by a larger force of French and Indians on the morning of Sept. 8, 1755.

The ravine was also part of the route for a wilderness road traveled by such 18th-century figures as Paul Revere, Benedict Arnold, Benjamin Franklin, George Washington, Thomas Jefferson and James Madison.

Patten says 1200 soldiers' remains may lie under the ravine. He points to after-battle reports and soldier journals that record the dead being buried 'where they fell' in the days following the battle

Patten says the land was damaged when Tomasovic dumped tons of soil, trees and road debris on his 2.8-acre property in the late 1990s, fronting a commercially zoned stretch of Route 9, the main drag in his tourist-friendly area.

At some point, the fill began cascading into the ravine where the ambush known as the Bloody Morning Scout is believed to have happened along the Military Road, built by New England militiamen just days before the battle.

Patten believes many casualties from the Battle of Lake George were buried afterward in the ravine, including provincial militiamen from Massachusetts and Connecticut and the Mohawks from New York.  For proof, he points to after-battle reports and soldier journals that record the dead being buried 'where they fell' in the days following the battle.

Patten, local historians and at least one town planning board member raised concerns about the ravine site after Tomasovic first applied in the mid-1990s for a permit to fill in his property. Nevertheless, the planning board approved his application in 1996, allowing Tomasovic to begin clearing trees and dumping soil on the property.

No official archaeological digs have been conducted in the ravine, and none are planned.

Patten feels something should be done to honor the common soldiers who died and are buried in the ravine.

'They were the first Americans to battle a professional foreign army,” he said. 'They deserve better.'

The
 town’s planning and zoning director sent Tomasovic a letter ordering 
him to cease fill operations on his property in December.

The
 letter didn’t mention any issues regarding the dumping of soil on the 
battle site, only focusing on concerns over stabilization of the high, 
approximately 250-foot-long embankment that now looms over the ravine 
along the property’s back side.

Tomasovic said he had finished fill 
work at the property last year, before receiving the letter. He has yet 
to build anything on his property, but says he still has plans for the 
parcel. He refused to divulge details.

Tomasovic defended his work at the property, pointing to a neighboring commercial property that was built decades ago, also by dumping fill into the ravine. Anyone building a business in an area as steeped in history as Lake George can’t help but run into preservation issues, he said.

'All of Lake George is a historic site,' Tomasovic said. 'Everywhere you build there, you’re going to find something historic.'
