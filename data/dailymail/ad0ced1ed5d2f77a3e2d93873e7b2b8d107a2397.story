Tesco was last night accused of undermining farmers by promoting foreign lamb during the peak British season.

The supermarket chain currently has an offer on New Zealand lamb.

But furious sheep farmers say British lamb is now at its best and most abundant – so there is no need to stock foreign lamb at all, let alone cut prices.

The National Farmers Union accused Tesco boss Philip Clarke of breaking a promise made less than 18 months ago, at the height of the horsemeat scandal, to sell as much home-grown meat as possible.

Last night Tesco was selling two 300g packs of New Zealand lamb chops for £6 – a saving of around 30 per cent.

New Zealand leg steaks were also on offer, with a 270g pack usually priced £4 available at two for £7 or three for £10.

However, at the Tesco store the Mail visited, British lamb was available only in the premium Finest range.

NFU President Meurig Raymond said: ‘Our members are upset and quite angry that when their product is at its very best, and at its most abundant, Tesco is actively marketing foreign produce. British lamb can never be better than it is in July. There is no reason at the moment to price-promote lamb from the other side of the world.’

The Government has been trying to persuade consumers and retailers to buy fewer imports and more home-grown food – both in order to support agriculture and to end our reliance on unreliable foreign supply chains.

We import 40 per cent of our food, and then Environment Secretary Owen Paterson told a farming conference in January: ‘As British farmers and food producers you know that we grow some of the best food in the world here. It is up to all of us – farmers, food manufacturers and the Government – to take action.’

UK farmers export 100,000 tons of lamb a year – more than a third of the total they produce – mostly to Europe where it is seen as a premium product.

Yet retailers import 100,000 tons, mostly from New Zealand.

Mr Raymond said he was not against imported lamb but saw no reason to promote foreign lamb at a time when the British product was at its best

In the winter months, New Zealand lamb is generally seen as a better product because the meat comes from younger animals. In spring and summer, however, farmers see no reason to import meat.

Mr Raymond said: ‘I am not against imports – consumers need choice and at certain points of the year we can see that personal taste might mean that retailers prefer to stock other products. But when our lamb is at its best, we can see no reason to promote foreign lamb above our own.’

A Tesco spokesman said the supermarket plans a half-price promotion on British lamb soon – but could not give a start date.

‘We sell more British lamb than any other retailer, and we are proud to sell and promote British lamb to our millions of customers right across the UK,’ he said.

‘We know it is a great product and we want to ensure that we sell it in large volumes when it is at the peak of its season.

‘This season we expect to sell more British lamb than ever before and over the next few weeks we are running fantastic half-price promotions on British lamb in our stores.

‘We are delivering on our commitment to strengthen our relationships with British sheep farmers through our Tesco Sustainable Lamb Group, which currently supports around 200 farmers. We are proud of our work together to bring great quality, affordable British lamb to our customers.’
