As any singleton knows, free dating services make it easy to meet men - but how do you weed out the creeps? You know, the ones who immediately send you naked selfies and expect you to reciprocate.

Well, a new dating app has been created which just might help.

Men are only allowed to join new dating site Wyldfire - which launches in the UK next month - if they are recommended and invited by a female member, through Facebook or by email.

Going Wyld: New dating app Wyldfire allows users to invite men anonymously, through Facebook or by email

New way to date: The app works in a similar way to Tinder, where you swipe those you like and equal matches can start talking to each other

The idea is that this will create a database of eligible men, with fewer weirdos and perverts than your average dating site.

The app then works in a similar way to Tinder, where you swipe those you like and equal matches can start talking to each other.

True love online? Wyldfire is just one of dozens of dating apps available in the UK and US, joining the likes of Tinder, Grouper and Hinge

The app launches next month, but early access is available through the website.

Wyldfire has incorporated features similar to Twitter and Instagram, to enhance your social dating network experience.

For example, you can see who is trending in your area and which style of profile photo is getting the most hits. 

Sarah
 Cardey, director of operations and marketing for Wyldfire told Ask Men:
 ‘When it comes to dating apps, men will go anywhere women go, but women
 won’t go unless it’s worth their time.

‘If
 women are the ones creating the community and are accountable for the 
type of people they let in, we feel like we could make a dating app 
women can be proud of.

‘Everyone
 has that one friend who they think is a great quality guy, but they 
either don’t want to date themselves or want someone else they know to 
date them.’
