Lewis Hamilton has spoken of the stresses and intense pressure of competing in Formula One as the world champion posed for the front cover of men's lifestyle magazine Man of the World.

The Mercedes driver features in Issue 11 of the magazine hitting the shelves on March 24 as the 30-year-old opens up about his rags to riches story in an intimate interview.

Hamilton became a double world champion last season   as he drove to victory after an intense season-long battle with team-mate Nico Rosberg, to add to his 2008 success for McLaren.

Hamilton and Mercedes got the new season off to the perfect start after the Briton won the Australian Grand Prix in Melbourne last Sunday with Rosberg following him across the finish line in a close second as the team dominated the race weekend.

During the interview with Spencer Morgan, Hamilton discussed the pressures that drivers have to contend. 

'The thing with Formula One is, people perhaps struggle to understand what's going on inside of the driver. There's the stress of millions of people watching. 

'You've got the pressure of the massive corporations sponsoring you. And then, on top of it, you put pressure on yourself, because you really want to succeed.'

'I want to empower young guys with the same belief I had instilled in me as a kid. Not everyone who gets beaten down by other people can overcome and use those experiences to get stronger.' 

With all the stresses that come with competing, Hamilton understands the need to relax and unwind during time off and so kits his homes in Colorado and Monaco out with a plethora of leisure activities.

'Of course you have to work, but I like to maximize every day, enjoy it, because you never know when it's your last. 

'I'm very, very, very conscious of that, so I just like to make sure I enjoy the time I get, and I like to share it with people. That's why we have the Mega Zone. I like to share it with all my friends.'
