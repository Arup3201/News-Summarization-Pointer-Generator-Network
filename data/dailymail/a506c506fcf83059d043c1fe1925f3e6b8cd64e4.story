A group of brave women have bared favourite body parts for an innovative new charity calendar.

The twelve women from Northamptonshire have showed off their toes, legs and tummies for a Cancer Research calendar which turned their body hang-ups into works of art.

For each month, a body part loathed by the model has been painted and turned into art, including a full moon bottom, a poppy flower stomach and tree trunk legs.

A woman's stomach is unrecognisable transformed into a rose covered love heart 

Each model had a particular body part they do not like painted - here a stomach becomes a night sky

Organiser Rebecca Askew, 47, from Kettering, Northants was inspired to arrange the calendar after being personally affected by cancer.

She said: 'One afternoon, I caught a glimpse of myself in a full length mirror and hated what I saw and I sat there feeling very sorry for myself.

'Just 30 minutes later I received a call to let me know one on my friends had died of cancer.

'She was the fourth in three years. I was so cross with myself for feeling such self-pity when I had a working body as I knew any of my dearly departed friends would rather have my working body in a second.

'For the Love Your Body calendar each model has a particular body part they do not like.

The women allowed their bodies to be transformed into a variety of objects or landscapes for the project

Proceeds form the sale on the innovative calender will all go to Cancer Research 

'Our artist Leslie Arnold has created something very beautiful and now we all love our body parts. The self-esteem we have gained from this project we would love to pass on for others.

'It's about time we started beating this horrible disease. Everyone knows someone who has been affected by cancer and we need to eradicate it.'

Photographer Ben Browning, 21, said: 'I was really excited when I heard about the project. I hadn't done anything like this before but I have witnessed people affected by cancer personally and I knew it was such a great cause.

'I think the calendar has come out really well.'
