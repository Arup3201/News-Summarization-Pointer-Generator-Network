It was a brave move by an ailing high street fashion retailer to restore its fortunes and entice more customers.

But French Connection's new advertising campaign showing naked models has spectacularly backfired, with shoppers branding the raunchy images 'offensive' and 'unnecessary.'

Prudish passers-by got more than they bargained for as they walked past the windows of the chain's stores when they copped an eyeful of top-naked models.

The posters of topless models with strategically placed ink drawings to cover their nudity below the waist have adorned the windows of the brands stores nationwide.

In Manchester the racy photographs drew gasps from innocent bystanders and some shocked shoppers called for more 'window-dressing'.

The black and white images show models completely naked from the waist up with ink sketches of clothes covering their bottom half.

They are part of the retailer's From Sketch To Store campaign and have attracted controversy, with five complaints being issued to the Advertising Standards Authority (ASA) since the campaign was launched.

It is understood that complainants to the advertising industry watchdog referred not only to the 'offensive' nature of the nudity, but also to the fact that the models appeared to some viewers to be 'unhealthily thin'.

A display at Manchester's flagship French Connection store in St Ann's Square includes an electronic billboard, which revolves to 
display two images of models naked from the waist up.

Three separate 
images rotate and are on display for a matter of seconds each.

The
 first image captures a model, posing naked from the waist up, next to 
the advertising campaign's slogan - From Sketch To Store.

The second image shows two models, with one topless and the other fully clothed. The third image is of two fully clothed models.

Pat Hobson, 54, from Bury, Greater Manchester, spotted the display. She said: 'I was shocked to see it and at first and I thought the woman had a T-shirt on until I looked closer.

'I think it is unnecessary on a busy street where there are lots of children.'

Another concerned shopper from Rusholme penned an official complaint to her local councillor, Rabnawaz Akbar.

It read: 'I would like to complain about the shop window display in the French Connection shop in town. It is offensive, it appears to be a topless woman.'

But Manchester City Council bosses said it was not their job to police a store's advertising campaign and it was 'all a matter of individual taste.'

Councillor Pat Karney said: 'It's not a priority for the council to police shop fronts in Manchester. These are all matters of public taste and reaction.

'French Connection is a very reputable company but has a reputation for edgy marketing. '

The councillor admitted that this was the first time he had seen 'this kind of adult presentation in a shop window', but added: 'These matters always divide public opinion and if people have an issue with the advert, they should complain directly to the store.'

During the campaign launch, French Connection bosses claimed the pictures for the Autumn/Winter 2013 campaign, taken by renowned fashion photographer John Rankin Waddell, had been praised in some spheres.

Complaints: People were not only shocked by the topless models but also by the fact that they seemed 'unnaturally thin'

The photographer, known professionally as Rankin, has shot celebrities including Daniel Craig and Kevin Spacey and worked on many major advertising campaigners including a recent project to promote Oral-B toothpaste with This Morning presenter Holly Willoughby.

Rankin said: 'I've always admired the brand for striving to push boundaries, and for their fearless approach to captivating campaign concepts.'

A spokesman for French Connection said it was not the store's policy to comment on complaints about advertising campaigns.

However, during the campaign launch bosses said: 'At French Connection, we don't follow trends, we make them.

'The campaign - our first shoot in black and white - maintains French Connection's irreverent sense of humour, which our customers have come to love and adore.'

Promotional material stated that the campaign was shot over two days with two female models and one male model 'having fun' in Rankin's London studio as he photographed them naked.

Reputation: French Connection bosses said the company was proud of its edgy image

Illustrator Jo Bird then used inks to draw clothing design sketches over the large scale prints.

French Connection marketing director Jennifer Roebuck claimed that the campaign 'brings out the fearless nature of the brand and our design credibility but with a twist'.

She added: 'When you look back at the iconic FCUK campaigns you can also see the fearless attitude and that is part of the brand and our design philosophy.'

In March this year it was revealed that the fashion retailer had slumped into the red after a dire year during which its young customers had flocked to more relevant designs elsewhere.

The firm, which has taken the £1.3million hit by shutting stores in a bid to cut costs, posted four profit warnings during the 18 months leading up to March.

It said total sales were down 8 per cent to £197.3million for the year ended January 31 - down 7.4 per cent on an underlying basis.

It also posted a £7.2million loss before tax, a fall from the £4.6million profit seen the previous year.
