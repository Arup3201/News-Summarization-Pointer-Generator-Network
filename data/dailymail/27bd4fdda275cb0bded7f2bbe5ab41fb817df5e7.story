An army sniffer dog who died alongside her handler in Afghanistan is to be awarded the animal equivalent of the Victoria Cross.

Sasha, a four-year-old yellow Labrador, will receive the PDSA Dickin Medal posthumously for saving countless lives on the battlefield.

The pooch was killed by a rocket-propelled grenade while on patrol with Lance Corporal Kenneth Rowe, 24, in a Taliban ambush in July 2008.

She had uncovered 15 bombs and hoards of weapons - thought to be more than any other dog in the conflict.

Commanders said Sasha had 'undoubtedly' prevented many soldiers and civilians from being murdered or maimed by insurgents.

Soldiers risking their lives on the frontline said her calm presence and wagging tale were comforting and reassuring.

L/Cpl Rowe, from Newcastle, served with the Royal Army Veterinary Corps's 104 Military Working Dog Squadron, attached to the 2nd Battalion the Parachute Regiment.

He was killed taking part in a mission in Sangin, a Taliban stronghold, in Helmand Province.

His mother Lyn Rowe, 54, said: Kenneth always adored animals and loved working with his dogs. He took his role protecting his fellow solders very seriously. We are so proud of him, and he would be incredibly proud that Sasha's bravery is being recognised with the Dickin Medal.'

Sasha's key role in the warzone was to sniff out hidden arms caches, improvised explosive devices and bomb-making equipment.

On one occasion she detected two mortars and a large quantity of weapons, including explosives and mines.

During their time together, L/Cpl Rowe and Sasha 'forged a unique bond', said commanders. The pair were considered the best handler and dog team in the region.

The soldier had been due to leave the frontline the day before he died but he had volunteered to stay on because he was worried about his base not having enough search cover for comrades.

PDSA director general Jan McLoughlin said: 'We are extremely proud to be awarding a posthumous medal to Sasha. The award is even more poignant as we approach the centenary of World War One and are reminded of the huge debt we owe the animals who serve in times of conflict.

'Sasha’s exceptional devotion to duty in Afghanistan saved many lives, both soldiers and civilians. This medal honours Sasha's unwavering service and her ultimate sacrifice.'

The Dickin medal is seen as the animal equivalent of the Victoria Cross. Sasha will be only the 65th animal to be given the prestigious award

Colonel Neil Smith, director of Army Veterinary and Remount Services, said the unit was 'delighted' that Sasha had been honoured.

He said: 'This prestigious award recognises how her devotion and skills undoubtedly saved the lives of many troops in Afghanistan. The award will give us the opportunity to once more celebrate L/Cpl Rowe and Sasha’s immeasurable contributions to military operations.'

Sasha's accolade will be presented at a ceremony attended by L/Cpl Rowe's family in London next month.

The Dickin Medal is the highest accolade that an animal can receive for saving human life while serving in a warzone.

Sasha's posthumous presentation brings the total number of Dickin Medals awarded to animals in war to 65.

Since it was introduced by PDSA founder Maria Dickin in 1943 it has been awarded to 29 dogs, 32 Second World War messenger pigeons, three horses and one cat.
