This is the incredible moment a college student makes four consecutive baskets in 30 seconds to win $10,000 in tuition money.

Gustavo Angel Tamayo, 23, wowed spectators on Monday night as he threw a basketball from various points on the court - with the last goal scored from mid-court.

Amazingly Tamayo, a senior at Bryan College in Dayton, Tennessee, told NBC News that he had 'never played basketball' before and was also grappling with a broken finger on his left hand.

Bryan College basketball coach Don Rekoske said he was impressed with Tamayo's skill.

'I'm not sure there's a tougher contest,' he told the Chattanooga Times Free Press.

'He had to go four for four, and you have to be hurried to make it within 30 seconds. It's a very tough contest to win.'

He was asked to perform a layup, a free throw, a three-pointer and lastly a half-court shot.

On completing the feat, Tamayo was greeted with congratulatory screams from the audience. Dozens of students also ran out onto the court to greet him.

Tamayo, who grew up in London and is hoping to make it as a professional soccer player after graduating from Bryan College next May, said some basketball players tried to repeat his stunt but failed.

He revealed 'concentration' was the secret to his success.
