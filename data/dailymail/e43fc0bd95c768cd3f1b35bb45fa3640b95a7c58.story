Two people plunged to their deaths into the icy Chicago River on Monday in what began as a man's reckless attempt to retrieve a dropped cell phone.

It was shortly after midnight when an 26-year-old Ken Hoang of St. Paul, Minnesota jumped over a downtown fence to retrieve a cellphone he'd dropped into the partially frozen river.

Haong's terrified friends, Quoc-Viet Phan Hoang, 23, and 21-year-old Lauren Li tried to help, but fell in after him.

Tragedy: A diver and a police officer from the Chicago Marine Unit did what they could to save three twenty-somethings who plunged into the icy Chicago River around midnight on Monday but only one survived

Rescuers pulled the men from the 
water, but spent hours looking for Li. Ken Hoang died at a hospital 
while the Li is presumed dead in the river.

Phan Hoang was taken to St. Joseph Hopsital, where he is in stable condition.

'My
 friend said he heard a yell [for] help, you know. At first I didn't 
believe it, so we still kept walking this way to keep sightseeing. As we
 got closer, he heard it again and I heard it again, too. And as we got 
closer, we yelled out, "Where you at?"' a witness told WLS.

Survivor: Quoc-Viet Phan Hoang was the only survivor of the tragedy. Rescuers pulled him from the icy river and took him to an area hospital where he remained in stable condition Monday night

'I kept saying who was he with? And 
they said he had a friend and girlfriend, too, that went under the 
water, but he couldn't find her. We called the police.'

Phan Hoang posted a wrenching Facebook response to the tragedy he witnessed Monday evening.

'Life's
 too short..I hope no one would ever have to go through something so 
unfortunate such as what has happened...from the bottom of my heart I am
 sorry for what happened...RIP Ken Hoang Lauren Li,' he wrote.

Outpourings
 of grief and support for Li have appeared on friends' Facebook pages 
and Hoang's family has created a memorial fund page at Youcaring.com.

'Rest in peace Ken Hoang and Lauren Li': The rescue mission for Lauren Li became a recovery mission as Chicago officials searched for the 21-year-old who fell into the icy Chicago River on Monday. Facebook posts honoring Li began appearing Monday evening

'In loving memory of Ken Hoang to support his family who lost a Son, brother and friend': Ken Hoang's family created a memorial fund on Youcaring.com

Terrible: A 26-year-old man fell through the ice while trying to retrieve a cellphone. His 23-year-old male friend and 21-year-old female friend went after him

Victim: The 26-year-old reportedly scaled this fence to retrieve his phone then fell though the ice. He was pulled from the ice and later died

'This fund was created in loving memory of Ken Hoang to support his family who lost a Son, brother and friend,' the site reads.

After less than a day, the fund had raised nearly $5,500 of a $15,000 goal to benefit the bereaved Hoang family.

While
 her body had yet to be found Monday night, Chicago police had termed 
their search for the woman a recovery mission by nightfall.

'The
 lesson learned here is real simple,' said Chicago Police Superintendent
 Garry McCarthy. 'If your pets go onto ice, if you drop a cell phone or 
wallet, do not try and retrieve it.'

Presumed dead: The 23-year-old man survived the ordeal and remained in stable condition Monday while the 21-year-old woman remained missing and was presumed dead

'The lesson learned here is real simple,' said Chicago Police Superintendent Garry McCarthy. 'If your pets go onto ice, if you drop a cell phone or wallet, do not try and retrieve it'
