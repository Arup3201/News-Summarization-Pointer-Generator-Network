Elected officials and rumored 2016 presidential candidates descended upon Detroit, Michigan, today to woo progressive activists at the annual Netroots Nation conference. But one high-profile, political figure is noticeably missing from the fray: Hillary Clinton.

Clinton has not attended the gathering since 2007 when she was competing in the Democratic primary for president, and conference organizers said she declined an invitation to speak this year.

The former Secretary of State opted to spend the week promoting her book, instead, holding book signings in New Jersey and Connecticut. This afternoon she sat down with Charlie Rose in his Manhattan office for an hour long interview that will air tonight on PBS.

Republicans
 lept to criticize Hillary's absence from the 3,000 person gathering as 
further proof that the 2016 frontrunner is out of touch with her base.

'Hillary Clinton is just too busy on her book tour to take time out for the Netroots conference in Detroit but with all of the news about how the Clintons have struggled financially, we get it, money first, even as colleges dole out millions to hear her speak despite rising tuition costs,' Republican National Committee spokesman Raffi Williams said, touching on Hillary's recent gaffes.

'Sounds like she’ll have to find another occasion to try to placate the liberal left as Elizabeth Warren and Joe Biden make their 2016 plays after seeing an opening with Hillary’s book tour stumbles and her 2016 moves echoing her failed 2008 campaign.'

However, conference
attendees said they weren't offended she didn't make speaking to them a priority this year.

'I think she’s obviously a very busy woman,' said Christine Soliz, a organizer with Planned Parenthood in the Detroit area who described herself a Hillary supporter.

'It's her loss,' said another attendee, adding that it's too early in the election cycle to 'harangue' Clinton for skipping the gathering.

Netroots Nation spokeswoman Mary Rickles told MailOnline she's 'not surprised' Hillary didn't attend again this year because 'she has not declared yet.'

'Most of the events that she’s doing are pretty benign
non-political events,' Rickles continued.

The San Francisco resident pointed out that pro-Clinton PAC Ready for Hillary had a substantial presence at the conference as a sponsor of both the conference itself and both a Motown-themed party on Friday evening. It also provided attendees with coffee during a snack break this morning.

‘Her team knows that she has a presence here, and regardless
of whether or not it fits her schedule, she’s still got a presence here, ' Rickles said. 'The
Ready for Hillary folks know what they’re doing.’

Asked for a comment on it's chosen candidate's absence from the conference today, Ready for Hillary spokesman Seth Bringman told MailOnline in an email, 'We're just thrilled to be a part of Netroots Nation and thrilled to be a co-sponsor of this amazing gathering.

'Hillary's support from progressives across the country - who are the backbone of our more than 2.5 million supporters - has been absolutely inspiring,' he said.

A spokesman for Clinton did not respond to a request for comment on Clinton's decision to skip the conference.

While Netroots attendees said they would still vote for Hillary if she were the Democratic nominee in 2016, it's no secret that Massachusetts Senator Elizabeth Warren is most activists' candidate of choice.

'Her values
are consistent with what I believe and what a lot of people here believe,' said Paula Branter, Executive Director of 
Workplace Fairness, a Washington, D.C. based organization that 
advocates for the fair treatment of workers and provides legal advice on
 worker’s rights.

Warren spoke at the conference in 2012 in person as a candidate, and gave a video address as a lawmaker last year. This year she is slated to give the keynote speech on Friday morning.

'It’s really
good to have the affirmation of someone that high [up] in a position of power
who’s saying all the right things,' Branter gushed.

'I would love it,' she replied when asked how she felt about Warren's potential presidential run.

As one attendee noted, Hillary has a 'troubled' relationship with the left wing of the Democratic Party. The former first lady and her husband are seen as too moderate for many progressives' taste and their willingness to accept large sums of money from the 'too big to fail' financial crowd is concerning to anti-Wall Street activists.

'From my perspective it’s problematic,' Pennsylvania resident Gerald Hoffman said, referring to the millions of dollars Bill and Hillary have received from the financial industry to speak at events.

'You have to wonder who a politician is beholden to if they’re getting all their money from people who are giving it in huge chunks,' Hoffman said. 'So I’m worried about that.'

‘If she gets elected, we’re going to have to continuously poke her to make sure that she stays to the left.'

Branter said Hillary may be avoiding the conference because she thinks kissing up to progressive activists is a waste of her time.

‘I think
that she might say, "Well look, I’m not gonna win over this crowd." '

'I can’t imagine being enough of an activist to want to come
to this conference and not having an opinion about Hillary,' Branter said.

'This is not a
persuadable audience.'

Another attendee, Garth
Eisenhard, a Silver Spring, Maryland, resident who described himself as ‘left
of Karl Marx,’ said progressives are 'either going to vote for
her or not if she’s the candidate, regardless of what she says or does,' so Hillary may as well continue ignoring the party's base.

'I mean it doesn’t matter if she comes here or not for
95 percent of the people,' he said.

'I will vote her with no reservations if she is the
Democratic candidate. I will vote for whoever is the Democratic candidate.'

However, Jason
Parsely, Associate Publisher of South Florida Gay News, a website that covers
the gay community, said Hillary will need the grassroots activists who attend this conference to have her back if she wants to make it that far in the first place.

‘If you want to build a grassroots network for any Democratic primary, these are the people you definitely need to rely on,' he said.

‘I’m
 disappointed that she’s not [here].'

'This is the largest, liberal, progressive 
gathering of activists around the country, so you’d think she would’ve 
made an attempt to be here.’

If Hillary runs for office and doesn't attend next year, however, Netroots-goers said they wouldn't let her off the hook so easily.

'If she’s running next year and even if she’s the frontrunner and seems to be the only one, she needs the progressive turnout,' said seven-year Netroots veteran Norman Buchwald.

'She should be here.'
