Sunderland were not alone in watching Virgil van Dijk of Celtic against Kilmarnock on Monday night.

Tony Pulis had also sent scouts to watch the Holland Under 21 international as West Brom continue to assess some of the talent in the Scottish Premiership.

Pulis wants another defender and has been linked with Robert Huth and Marc Wilson of former club Stoke City.

The Dutchman would cost around £8m though which would be a big chunk of Albion's budget.

Van Dijk has been an ever present for the Bhoys so far this season, scoring six goals in 32 appearances. 

Celtic are preparing to set off for a week-long training camp in Gran Canaria and first-team coach John Kennedy said: 'Until something is firm and concrete it is just rumours. Virgil is a massive player for us, we don’t want to lose him.'
