A London trader who refused to take part in his company initiation ceremony of running across the office while colleagues doused him in water is suing his former firm for unfair dismissal.

Robert Bou-Simon, a broker at BGC Partners, told an employment tribunal he was the victim of a campaign of abuse after he declined to participate in 'the run' after his first trade at the firm's London office.

The Australian, who was head of the New York-based firm's basis swaps desk, said he had to resign after he was victimised and taunted about his support for Chelsea Football Club and an Australian rugby team.

But his former firm argued that he was the subject of disciplinary investigations after he had fallen asleep at his desk.

BGC said Robert Bou-Simon had fallen asleep at his desk, but he argued it wasn't uncommon there, and says he was victimised for refusing to undergo initiation rite (file picture shows another broker at BGC)

Mr Bou-Simon says he was hounded out of his job at BGC's London office, pictured, after refusing to do 'the run'

Mr Bou-Simon said in a witness statement that his refusal to go through with the initiation ceremony 'did not go down well with my colleagues on the floor', who chanted "only real men run", The Times reported.

He said he believed the practice was unsafe, and cited a case of one worker who had to be taken to hospital after crashing into a piece of furniture.  Mr Bou-Simon said that his manager described his refusal to take part as 'downright un-Australian'.

The trader, who rejoined BGC in 2012 having worked for it seven years beforehand, said he was also taunted for supporting sports teams his colleagues did not.

Mr Bou-Simon also complained that his manager, Mark Webster, had tried to force him out of the firm by offering him an unsuitable position at a company unit called Mint.

But his brokerage firm alleged that he had fallen asleep at his desk - which Mr Bou-Simon said was not uncommon at BGC - and was the subject of disciplinary proceedings.

Mr Webster said he and Mr Bou-Simon, who now works at Vantage Capital Markets, had agreed his move to the new role, and denied trying to force him out.

BGC did not respond to MailOnline's request for comment. The hearing continues.

Cambridge graduate and high-flying banker Svetlana Lokhova won an employment tribunal against the Russian Sberbank after claiming she was victimised

Last year,banker Svetlana Lokhova, 32, won a sexual harassment claim against her Russian-based firm, Sberbank.

The Cambridge graduate, who worked at the company's London office on Fleet Street, said she was targeted after reporting a senior trader for insider dealing.

She told an employment tribunal how she was nicknamed 'Crazy Miss Cokehead' and told to visit Nigeria for sex with tribesmen to 'calm her down'.

Six months ago, Morgan Stanley trader Benjamin Price won a payout from the American bank after suing the firm for unfair dismissal.

Mr Price said he was unfairly sacked from his job because he complained about being paid less than the firm agreed.  He said he had taken the job after being offered a deal worth about £670,000 a year, but said he was paid just £533,000, before it was cut to £518,000.

Mr Price said the culture at Morgan Stanley was such that it only allowed people to speak out if they agreed with senior bosses.

Mr Price told the panel yesterday: ‘Despite my good performance, I was a squeaky wheel who was not prepared to put up and shut up.'

The East London Employment Tribunal agreed, and Morgan Stanley was ordered to pay Mr Price undisclosed compensation.

And earlier this year, City broker Robin Clark, 44, was gunned down at Shenfield station in Essex in an incident still being investigated by police.

The talented money-maker, who works as a Euro derivatives trader at RP Martin, was shot in the leg at point blank range.

On his first day back at work after being sewn up, his colleagues played a trick on him, sneaking up behind him and shouting 'bang'.

Police arrested, interviewed and released a man on suspicion of conspiracy to commit murder.
