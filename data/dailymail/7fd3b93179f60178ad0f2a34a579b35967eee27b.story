The White House has slammed the NFL over its recent spate of child and domestic abuse scandals, calling the revelations 'deeply troubling'.

An official said in D.C. on Thursday that the football league must 'get a handle' on its widespread issues of violence and have a message of 'zero tolerance'.

During a briefing on an awareness campaign about sexual assaults on college campuses, an official said the NFL had an 'obligation' to the U.S. and its millions of young fans to properly discipline those involved in abuse.

The White House official criticized the NFL during a briefing about the 'It's On Us' campaign, an initiative to fundamentally shift thinking about sexual assault and how to prevent it. 

Critics have been calling for NFL Commissioner Roger Goodell's resignation over his handling of domestic abuses incidents involving Ray Rice, Adrian Peterson and Jonathan Dwyer. 

President Obama was shocked by the video showing Rice knocking out his then-fiancée, his chief of staff said earlier this month. 

'The president was shocked by what he saw, let's put it that way,' Denis McDonough said. 

An official later added: '...like any American, (Obama) believes that domestic violence is contemptible and unacceptable in a civilized society'. 

The White House's strong words came after another NFL player, Arizona Cardinals running back Jonathan Dwyer, was arrested on Wednesday.

Police said he head-butted his wife and broke her nose after she refused to have sex with him, and punched her in the face the next day.

The details surfaced in a police report a day after Dwyer was arrested on aggravated assault charges and deactivated from all team activities. He spent a night in jail and made a brief court appearance before being released early on Thursday.

Dwyer, 25, was arrested over two incidents that occurred on July 21 and 22 at his Phoenix residence, just days before the Cardinals reported to training camp.  

The player denied  assault but acknowledged that he punched walls in his home, threw a phone and that his wife bit his lip during the disputes, according to the police report. As he was released from jail on Thursday, he said he never hurt his son.

He was ordered to wear an electronic tag and banned from contact with his wife.

The Cardinals released a statement on Wednesday which said the team was 'aware of these allegations this afternoon when notified by Phoenix police and are cooperating fully.

'Given the serious nature of the allegations we have taken the immediate step to deactivate Jonathan from all team activities.' 

Chris Rainey was cut from the Cardinals after being accused of slapping his girlfriend 

The NFL said the case will be reviewed under the league's personal-conduct policy. 

The Cardinals then released a second player accused of domestic violence. 

The team announced on Thursday that running back Chris Rainey had been released from its practice squad.

Rainey was a fifth-round pick of the Steelers in 2012, but he was cut by the team after his rookie season when he was accused of slapping his girlfriend. He later pleaded no contest to disorderly conduct.

Cardinals inside linebacker Daryl Washington also pleaded guilty to assaulting his ex-girlfriend and is serving a year of supervised probation. Washington has not yet been penalized by the NFL for the offense but is suspended for this season for violating the league's substance abuse policy. 

The NFL has been rocked by domestic violence issues since a videotape surfaced that showed former Baltimore Ravens running back Ray Rice knocking out his then-fiancee in an Atlantic City, New Jersey, elevator. 

Minnesota Vikings star running back Adrian Peterson was indicted on felony child-abuse charges. 

On Wednesday, the Carolina Panthers decided that star defensive end Greg Hardy will not play any more games for the team until his domestic violence case is resolved.

Hardy was convicted of assault on a female and communicating threats after the victim said the 6-foot-4, 275-pound player threw her in the bathtub and onto a sofa covered with guns before threatening to kill her. Hardy is appealing the ruling. 

Critics have called for NFL Commissioner Roger Goodell's resignation for his handling of Rice's case. 

Rice was originally suspended for two games, then banned indefinitely after the video surfaced of his brutal attack on then-fiancée Janay in an Atlantic City casino elevator.
