Two carjackers have been jailed after pistol-whipping one victim and threatening to shoot others in a six-week spree that saw them steal £105,000 worth of vehicles.

Boustaan Adalat, 22, and Asri Hussain, 25, attacked men and women driving alone across the Small Heath, Sparkhill and Sparkbrook areas of Birmingham, before fleeing in their stolen cars. 

In one case, they battered a man with a gun until he handed over the keys to his Ford Focus, while in others, they put the weapon to the heads and stomachs of victims.

They were eventually captured in a police chase after they carjacked a Mercedes from a female driver - and then crashed the vehicle.

Now, the pair have been jailed for ten years each after pleading guilty to robbery, possession of an imitation firearm and conspiracy to rob at Birmingham Crown Court.

The court heard that Adalat, from Kitts Green, and Hussain, from Saltley, targeted mainly lone motorists in inner-city Birmingham during February and March this year.

They first struck on February 5 when they stole a £14,000 Ford Fiesta from a road in Small Heath as motorist Safiyya Bi was collecting her son from a takeaway.

Hussain was carrying what looked like a small black handgun and the mother was ordered out of the vehicle as Adalat approached from the rear of the car. They then drove off with the vehicle. 

Ms Bi said: 'I was absolutely terrified. The men threatened me with a very real looking gun and I thought they were going to shoot me if I did not give them the car.

Crash: Adalat and Hussain were eventually caught by police after they carjacked this £38,000 Mercedes from Patricia Mcintosh - and then crashed the vehicle. Ms Mcintosh later said: 'I thought I was going to be shot dead'

Gun: This gas-powered pistol, loaded with ball bearings, was discarded by Adalat in a garden prior to his arrest

'I worked hard to buy my car. I work hard in life to support my family and if we want something nice we have to work and save for it. These two people just took my car at gunpoint.' 

On February 11, Adalat then held up Imran Khan in another road in the area, before stealing his £3,100 Mini Cooper and warning him: 'Don't try any funny business or I will pop your legs.'

Then, on February 15, the pair threatened care workers Emma Hinch and Natalie Roberts with a handgun, before dragging them from their £24,000 Audi as they visited a client in Small Heath.

Four weeks later, on March 14, Hussain car-jacked Aurangzeb Saddiqui in a road in Sparkhill, and stole his brand new £19,000 Audi after threatening him with what appeared to be a gun.

During the six-week spree, Adalat and Hussain stole seven cars from victims in Birmingham.

These included:

February 5 - Ford Fiesta (£14,000)

February 11 - Mini Cooper (£3,100)

February 15 - Audi (£24,000)

March 14 - Audi (£19,000) 

March 26 - Ford Focus

March 27 - Astra

March 29 - Mercedes (£38,000)  

The victim later told police: 'I really believed when he put the gun to my head that he was going to shoot me and I would be dead.'

Hussain struck again on March 26 when he and another hooded male targeted retired Christopher Merchant in Kyotts Lake Road, Sparkbrook.

The victim said he was pistol whipped to the ground and told to hand over the keys to his Ford Focus or he would be shot.

Adalat was involved in another car-jacking on the evening of March 27 when Samuel White had his Astra stolen in Chapman Road after he was threatened with what appeared to be a revolver.

But the pair's crime spree came to an end on March 29 when Patricia Mcintosh's £38,000 Mercedes was targeted.

The 52-year-old was returning to her car when the thugs demanded the keys to her convertible, with Hussain putting a gun to her stomach and Adalat pushing her to the ground.

In a victim statement, Ms Mcintosh said: 'At the time they robbed me I was on my own and I had been shopping in Small Heath, at shops I have spent my entire life shopping at.

'I thought I was going to be shot dead by them. I only bought the Mercedes convertible about one month before and I used to love driving the car.

'Since these two robbed me I have felt extremely vulnerable. I have not been back to Small Heath as I am scared of being a victim again. I do not like going out alone in my car.

'Every time I get into my Mercedes it reminds me of robbery. Even through the summer I have left the convertible roof up as I am too scared to drive around with the roof down as I am worried about getting robbed again.' 

After stealing the vehicle, the pair fled, but were shortly spotted by a police patrol car. A pursuit followed, during which Hussain and Adalat crashed the Mercedes into a wall and fled on foot.

They ran along residential streets closely followed by police. CCTV shows Adalat sprinting through a cul-de-sac with a gun still in his hands.

He was arrested hiding in the bathroom of an unsuspecting homeowner's house nearby, having discarded the gun in a nearby garden. Hussain was arrested minutes later.

Following a search, the gun was recovered and when examined, was found to be a gas-powered pistol, loaded with ball bearings.

Imprisoned: Adalat (pictured) and Hussain were said by police to be 'motivated by money and greed' 

West Midlands Police's Serious Organised Crime Unit (SOCU) launched a painstaking investigation, led by senior investigating officer Detective Inspector Ben West and officer in charge Detective Constable Craig Hall.

The team began to piece together Adalat and Hussain's activities during February and March and discovered the pair matched the descriptions of 13 other car-jackings.

During identity parades they were picked out by drivers and with CCTV evidence, officers had enough to charge them with 14 offences.

Both men had a string of previous convictions. Adalat had previously been jailed for possession of knife. In January 2011, he had been sentenced to six years after being involved in a £37,000 robbery of a jewellers. He was on licence for that offence at the time of the car-jackings.

Appearing at court yesterday, Adalat's defence lawyer Daniel White said his client had shown 'genuine remorse'.

He added the criminal was a cannabis user who had what he thought was undiagnosed Attention Deficit Hyperactivity Disorder.

Hussain had received four years for robbery in December 2006 and had also served time for theft convictions.

Nicholas Berry, defending, said his client had started using cannabis at the age of 12 and later moved on to Class A drugs.

Sentencing the pair, Her Honour Judge Elizabeth Stacey said: 'It's a really serious matter to rob people, even more to do so with an imitation firearm which does not look like an imitation firearm from what I have seen. These were very serious repeated robberies.'

Speaking after the case, Detective Inspector Ben West said: 'These men targeted lone drivers and in the majority of cases women. They were motivated by money and greed and it would appear they stole the cars to strip and sell on for parts.'

None of the cars have been recovered and both defendants refused to speak during police interview.
