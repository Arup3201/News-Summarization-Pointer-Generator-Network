Archaeologists have taken a step closer to discovering the mysteries that lie inside an ancient tomb unearthed in Greece.

Following months of excavation, a team of researchers has made their way into the third chamber of the tomb, in the Amphipolis region of Serres, through a wall that was only recently uncovered.

But, upon entering the chamber, the archaeologists may have damaged the structural integrity of the surrounding structure - and are concerned it may collapse before they discover what lies beyond.

Caryatids are sculptures of females that take the place of a column to support a building.

They are a distinctive feature in Ancient Greek architecture and famously hold up the Erechtheion on the Acropolis in Athens.

Their elaborate hairstyles provide support to their necks that would otherwise be too thin and weak to support a heavy load.

The Caryatids in the Greek tomb are made of marble and support an inner entrance into the burial plot.

They
 feature the same sculpting technique used for the heads and wings of 
two sphinxes found guarding the main entrance of the tomb last month.

Experts believe the ancient mound, situated around 65 miles (100km) from Thessaloniki, was built 
for a prominent Macedonian in around 300 to 325BC.

It may be the final resting place for a 
relative or senior official of the famous king.

Access to the third chamber was made possible after experts unearthed two sculpted female figures, known as Caryatids, last week.

By removing a large volume of soil, behind the wall bearing the two sculpted female figures, they were able to uncover the next chamber.

Until now, experts had only partially investigated the antechamber of the tomb and uncovered a marble wall concealing one or more inner chambers.

During initial observations, archaeologists found that the dome structure (pictured) has been weakened, as a result of losing a large amount of earth, and the researchers found the arched dome of the third chamber is on the verge of collapse, due to 'deep and extensive cracks'

The second and third chambers, not pictured, have not yet been explored

During initial observations, the archaeologists found that the level of sandy soil in the third chamber is lower than in the previous two chambers.

The dome structure has been weakened, as a result of losing a large amount of earth, and the researchers found the arched dome of the third chamber is on the verge of collapse, due to 'deep and extensive cracks' on either side.

Before the discovery of the Caryatids, it 
was feared the ‘incredibly important’ tomb dating to the time of 
Alexander the Great had been plundered in antiquity. 

Last week, archaeologists unearthed two sculpted female figures, known as Caryatids, (pictured) as they dug deeper at the site in the northeast of Greece. The half-bodied statues made of marble have thick hair covering their shoulders and are wearing a sleeved tunic

Archaeologists
 excavating an ancient mound in northern Greece (pictured)
uncovered the entrance to an important tomb some months ago. It is 
believed to have been built at the end of the reign of warrior-king 
Alexander the Great and Prime Minister Antonis Samaras described the 
discovery as 'extremely important’

Archaeologist said that a hole in the decorated wall, and signs of forced entry, indicated it had been looted.

But
 the discovery of the female sculptures gave fresh hope that some treasure may have survived, after all.

The Caryatids are made of marble and support an inner entrance into the tomb.

They feature the same sculpting technique used for the heads and wings of two sphinxes found guarding the main entrance of the tomb last month.

‘The structure of the second entrance with the Caryatids is an important finding, which supports the view that it is a prominent monument of great importance,’ the Culture Ministry said.

The face of one of the Caryatids is 
missing, while both figures have one hand outstretched in a symbolic 
move to push away anyone who would try to violate the tomb.

Archaeologists have said that the Amphipolis site appears to be the largest ancient tomb ever discovered in Greece at 1,935ft (590m) wide.

Last month, pictures emerged of a pair of sphinxes guarding the grave's main entrance beneath a large arch and experts said that most of the earth around the mythical creatures had been removed to reveal part of a marble lintel with frescoes.

Chief archaeologist Katerina Peristeri said that the monument being uncovered is a unique tomb, not just for Greece but for the entire Balkanic peninsula, and described it as being of ‘global interest’.

Alexander (statue pictured) was born in Pella, the ancient capital of Macedonia in July 356 BC, and died of a fever in Babylon in June 323 BC

Alexander III of Macedon was born in Pella, the ancient capital of Macedonia in July 356 BC.

He died of a fever in Babylon in June 323 BC.

Alexander led an army across the Persian territories of Asia Minor, Syria and Egypt claiming the land as he went.

His greatest victory was at the Battle of Gaugamela, now northern Iraq, in 331 BC, and during his trek across these Persian territories, he was said to never have suffered a defeat.

This led him to be known as Alexander the Great. 

Following this battle in Gaugamela, Alexander led his army a further 11,000 miles (17,700km), founded over 70 cities and created an empire that stretched across three continents.

This covered from Greece in the west, to Egypt in the south, Danube in the north, and Indian Punjab to the East.  

Alexander was buried in Egypt.

His fellow royals were traditionally interred in a cemetery near Vergina, far to the west. 

The lavishly-furnished tomb of Alexander's father, Philip II, was discovered during the 1970s. 

Prime 
Minister Antonis Samaras added the discovery ‘is clearly extremely important’.

Alexander,
 who started from the northern Greek region of Macedonia to build an 
empire stretching as far as India, died in 323 B.C. and was buried in 
Egypt.

 fellow royals were traditionally interred in a cemetery near Vergina, 
to the west, where the lavishly-furnished tomb of Alexander's father, 
Philip II, was discovered during the 1970s.

Greece's culture ministry said that earth around the sphinx statues has been removed to reveal part of a marble lintel with frescoes (pictured) but hopes of finding further treasures now seem to be slim

The tomb is situated in Amphipolis region of Serres in Greece (marked). Archaeologists believe the grave may have belonged to a senior ancient official. While it looks largely undisturbed, there are fears that looting took place hundreds of years ago

In Greek tradition, the mythical sphinx has the haunches of a lion, sometimes with the wings of a great bird, and the face of a human - usually a woman.

It was described by writers as being treacherous and merciless.

In many myths, including Oedipus, those who could not answer a riddle posed by the monster, would be killed and eaten.

The sphinx described by the Ancient Egyptians was usually male and more benevolent.

In both cultures, they often guarded entrances to temples and important tombs.

The oldest sphinx found guarding a site was discovered in Turkey and dates to 9,500 BC.

But 
archaeologists believe the Amphipolis grave, which is surrounded by a 
surprisingly long and well-built wall with courses of marble 
decorations, may have belonged to a senior ancient official.

Dr
 Peristeri argued the mound was originally topped by a large stone 
lion that was unearthed a century ago, and is now situated around 3 
miles (5km) from the excavation site.

Geophysical teams have identified there are three main rooms within the huge circular structure.

In
 the past, the lion has been associated with Laomedon of Mytilene, one 
of Alexander's military commanders who became governor of Syria after 
the king's death.

‘The excavation will answer the crucial question of who was buried inside,’ Mr Samaras said.

Archaeologists who fear that few treasures and clues to its owner may remain in the tomb, said that part of a stone wall that blocked off the subterranean entrance was found to be missing, while the sphinxes, which were originally six feet (two metres) high, lack heads and wings.

The tomb is situated in the Amphipolis region of Serres in Greece

@highlight

Its huge burial site is said to date back between 325 and 300 BC

@highlight

This means it could have been built during the reign of Alexander the Great

@highlight

Archaeologists have now entered the third chamber of the tomb

It is unknown if anything lies beyond the third chamber

@highlight

Two sculpted female figures, known as Caryatids, were found last week
