House Republicans considered this morning lifting the ban on congressional earmarks that allow federal lawmakers to direct certain contracts, projects and 'pork' spending to their home districts.

As it currently stands, no earmarks of any kind can be tacked onto legislation that originates in the House or the Senate, with both chambers having banned the targeted appropriations several years ago in the name of fiscal responsibility.

Alabama Rep. Mike Rogers wanted the House to make an exception to the  moratorium for the next Congress for 'State, locality (including county and city governments), or a public utility or other public entity.' 

But House Speaker John Boehner was able to talk his caucus out of it, a source familiar with the proceedings told MailOnline.

Boehner spoke in opposition to Rogers amendment during the meeting, the source said, and it was successfully defeated. 

Congress banned earmarks, in part, to curb abuse by lawmakers who would hold government projects hostage in order to force their colleagues to vote their way their way on certain pieces of legislation. The process also led to wasteful spending, including on the infamous Bridge to Nowhere in Alaska.

The way Rogers and other lawmakers who want the ban lifted see it, however, federal funds are either going to be appropriated by the legislative branch or the Obama administration, so Congress may as well take back the reigns.

'I do not believe most people trust how President Obama spends our tax dollars,' Rogers told MailOnline in an email today. 

'This proposal would allow the conservative, Republican-controlled House to reassert its Constitutional authority over the Obama Administration and the spending decisions it is currently making.'

House Republicans discussed the measure in a closed-door rules meeting and made the decision via secret ballot.

Given that GOP controls a majority of seats in the lower chamber, any action by Republicans this morning would have led to an official lifting of the ban on certain types of earmarks in the House, and potentially in the Senate, where senior Democrats have been trying revive the measure since last summer.

Like Rogers, Senate Majority Leader Harry Reid believes the earmark ban has reallocated at spending power meant for the legislature to the executive branch and he would like to see it given back to lawmakers.

'I have never backed down from my support of congressionally directed spending,' Reid told the Huffington Post in June. 

'That's our constitutional obligation and duty. I do not believe that the White House should make all these decisions. I am proud of all the earmarks I have gotten for the state of Nevada. They'll come back - it's only a question of time because that's our constitutional obligation.'

At the time Reid claimed that 'a very senior member of the House Republican caucus' also wanted to see the restriction rolled back but he did not say who. Boehner's efforts to save the ban today signal that it was not him, however.
