When you’re Chief Scout, you  have to be prepared for important occasions.

And none could be more momentous than meeting the Queen. Bear Grylls’s pride was evident today as he introduced the monarch at the annual scouting review, held at Windsor Castle.

The adventurer, who has been Chief Scout since 2009, was there along with the Queen to honour 600 high-achieving youngsters from Britain and the Commonwealth.

Most received the Queen’s Scout Award
– the highest honour a Scout can achieve – while 50 received gallantry 
awards for outstanding bravery in saving the lives of others.

Wearing a pale green, Karl Ludwig coat and matching hat by 
Peter Sommerville, the Queen - 
who is patron of the Scout Association - was accompanied by the Duke of 
Edinburgh at the ceremony, which was lashed by heavy wind and rain.

She
was met and introduced by television star Grylls, who is Chief 
Scout and described the day as his favourite in the scouting calendar.

To earn the Queen's Scout Award 
youngsters, aged between 16 and 25, need to have completed a range of 
tasks including an expedition in wild country, spend at least five days 
undertaking a residential product, as well as helping in their 
community.

Owen Griffiths, 
aged nine, from Northolt, west London, received the gallantry award for 
his swift response to his mother Lucinda having a stroke in their home.

Owen, who had to look after his 
18-month-old sister Tamzin, phoned his grandmother for help and cared 
for his mother while help arrived.

Ms Griffiths said: 'Owen was so brave that day - I am so very proud of him.

'I cried when I found out about the award, he did so well.'

Erin
Billington, 18, from Leicestershire, said: 'One of the best bits of 
achieving my Queen's Scout Award was my residential experience.

'I
spent a week with Norfolk Fire and Rescue Service learning how to wire 
up hoses from hydrants into engines, how to extinguish a fire and how to
rescue people from a burning building.

'I also completed my expedition in the Yorkshire Dales.

'Hiking through the countryside with my mates and everything you need on your back is my idea of scouting.'

Normally the review involves only UK Scouts but this year it included youngsters from as far afield as Uganda, Belize and St Lucia.

Bear Grylls said: 'All these young people have lived the adventure of a lifetime to achieve their Queen's Scout Awards, and I admire that spirit so much.

'They are huge inspirations to all the other Scouts in the UK and I am so pleased that Scouting has honoured them today. They are amazing.'
