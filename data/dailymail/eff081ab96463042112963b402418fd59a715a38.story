UEFA have announced ticket details for the Champions League final in Berlin - with each finalist receiving just a 20,000 allocation and prices ranging between £50 and £280.

The show-piece final of Europe's premier competition takes place later than usual this year, with 16 clubs still fighting it out for a place in Berlin on June 6.

Tickets for the general public via UEFA's ballot go on sale on Thursday at 11am UK time, with 6,000 available to fans worldwide.

This season's Champions League final is on June 6 at the 70,500-capacity Olympic Stadium in Berlin

Tickets for the show-piece event at the Olympic Stadium will cost between £50 and £280

Chelsea, Manchester City and Arsenal will all hope to be playing in the vast arena come June 6

Each club competing in the final will be allocated 20,000 tickets.

That would be bad news for season-ticket holders from Chelsea (24,000), Manchester City (36,000) and Arsenal (45,000), of whom a significant number would miss out.

The ticket prices, split across four categories, represent a price-freeze compared to last year's final won by Real Madrid against local rivals Atletico Madrid in Lisbon.

But supporters of any English club with their eyes on Berlin's Olympic Stadium in June could be disappointed with their allocation as Chelsea, Manchester City and Arsenal all have more season-ticket holders than that figure would accommodate.

However, the 20,000 figure is more than Chelsea were given for their two most recent European finals in Munich (17,500) for the Champion League and Amsterdam (9,800) in the Europa League. Arsenal and Chelsea received allocations of 21,000 for their previous finals in Paris and Moscow respectively.

The remaining 24,500 tickets - more than one third of the 70,500 capacity - have been shoehorned for UEFA to impress sponsors, corporate partners and their members.

While City and Arsenal face an uphill task to even reach the quarter-final stage after home first-leg defeats to Barcelona and Monaco respectively, Chelsea will hope their 1-1 draw away at PSG will be enough to help them through in the return leg at Stamford Bridge next Wednesday. 

Members of the public can apply for up to two tickets per person via UEFA.com. Those lucky enough to secure themselves a ticket through the ballot will be informed by April 10.
