When mum says it's bedtime, it's bedtime ... it doesn't matter what age (or species of animal) you are!

But as any parent knows, it can be easier said than done getting your little one to put their head down - especially when it's the last thing they want to do.

That's exactly what Yuan Yuan the panda found this week when she tried to convince her toddler, Yuan Zai, that playtime was over and that it was time for bed at Taipei Zoo.

The recalcitrant cub simply would not listen and gave her frustrated mother the slip for a full ten minutes, rolling around and eating bamboo shoots to her heart's content.

But it was a battle the seven-month-old was never going to win and in the end Yuan Yuan caught her by the scruff and bear-marched her back to bed.

Yan Zai was born to much fanfare at the zoo on July 6 last year, weighing 183.4g and and standing at 15.5cm tall.

But now she has grown, keepers say she is fast becoming quite the madam and loves nothing more than giving her weary mother the runaround in their enclosure.

Giant Pandas are notoriously difficult to breed and it often takes years, if at all, for them to conceive in captivity.

With fewer than 2,500 
giant pandas living free in China, down largely to deforestation and a growing human population, conservationists are desperate to increase their numbers to boost their dwindling numbers.

Poaching has also been an issue over the years although the Chinese government has made efforts to reign in illegal hunting of wild animals in recent years.
