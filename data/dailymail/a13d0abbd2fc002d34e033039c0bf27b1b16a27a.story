A mother-of-two has been charged with domestic violence after starving her newborn baby to the brink of death and neglecting her two-year-old daughter, police said. 

Katherine Amanda Mattern, 23, is accused of 'withholding the basic necessities of life' from her seven-week-old son Liam Alexander Lee, according to court documents.

The woman, from Burien, Washington mistreated her son for such a long time that without medical treatment he would have died, doctors said, adding that any illness could have proved fatal.

Domestic violence charge: Katherine Mattern has been accused of starving her seven-week-old baby boy to the brink of death in Burien, Washington

Innocence: Two-month-old Liam Alexander Lee was seriously underfed and had scabies when doctors examined him on May 15

Doctors at Children’s Hospital in Seattle were alarmed to find that the boy was suffering from severe malnutrition when they examined him on May 15 and called child protective services.

Mattern told doctors she thought that her son 'looked a little skinny'. The baby was now being cared for in hospital and his condition had improved.

The mother had previously been investigated by child protective services in Oregon over the care of her now two-year-old daughter Abigail Lilly. She left the state in August to move back to Washington to live with relatives.

Child protective services in the Seattle area contacted Mattern in February after it was reported that her daughter had scratches on her face, according to q13fox.com.

The little girl had survived at the filthy home in Washington state, where they lived with Mattern's mother, by foraging for food, it was reported.

She was believed to have had better nutrition than her baby brother because she had spent some time in the care of other family members.

The home was described by authorities
 as 'cluttered and unsanitary'. Both children were treated for scabies 
while the two-year-old also had an MRSA infection. Abigail and Liam were now being looked after by the state.

Mattern is reportedly married to a registered sex offender who was banned from having contact with children.

Mattern was arrested yesterday and charged with criminal mistreatment in the second degree – domestic violence of her son. She has not been charged in relation to any abuse of her daughter but authorities said that the case is under review. She faces up to five years in prison if found guilty.

Bail has been set at $200,000 and Mattern is due to be arraigned on June 14.
