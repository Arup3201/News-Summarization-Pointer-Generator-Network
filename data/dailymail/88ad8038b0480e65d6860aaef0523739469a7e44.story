Florida police are urging motorists to nominate a 'designated texter' in a bid to curb road deaths caused by using a mobile phone at the wheel.

The scheme takes its cues from 'designated drivers', where revellers select one person to remain sober and drive their friends home after a night out.

The idea is that passengers take control of a driver's smart phone and handle incoming texts, reports the Orlando Sentinel.

The Orlando-Orange County Expressway Authority says texting while driving can be as dangerous as drink driving and launched the campaign to increase public awareness of the problem and reduce the number of distracted drivers on the road.

Oak Ridge High School senior Trevon Cleveland says that when his friends are driving, he encourages them not to send messages via text or check social media sites.

'I always ask my friends if they want me to send a text while they're driving, because I don't want them to put my life in jeopardy,' the 17-year-old said.

'I used to see one or two friends texting and driving, but now none of them do it anymore.

'I think it's great that they're avoiding a dangerous situation. Texting and driving really impairs you.'

The authority is inviting people to take a pledge to be a designated texter and is also urging those who register to submit a picture and a story explaining why they have taken the pledge.

'We're hoping that people will take action and make the pledge,' Expressway Authority spokesman Jeff Marshall said. 'The goal is to motivate others to follow that behavior.'

The campaign draws parallels between texting while driving and getting behind the wheel while drunk

The road agency also has plans to develop a long-term plan with other local and national government agencies, as well as private companies, to curb texting by drivers.

Officials will take stories from the pledge registry and 'provide that to legislators in Tallahassee who are pushing for laws to ban texting while driving,' Mr Marshall said.

Florida is one of only a handful of U.S. states that hasn't passed a ban on texting while driving despite previous efforts. Critics say banning text messaging is going too far to regulate people's behavior inside their vehicles.

The campaign does not specifically target youngsters, but research has found that younger drivers are more likely than others to text while driving.

Steve Olson, a spokesman for the Florida Department of Transportation, said some drivers have already adopted the practice of appointing a 'designated texter'.

'I think a lot of drivers have a designated texter because there's too much going on in a car while a person is driving,' he said. 'Let's hope the campaign will reinforce that behavior.'
