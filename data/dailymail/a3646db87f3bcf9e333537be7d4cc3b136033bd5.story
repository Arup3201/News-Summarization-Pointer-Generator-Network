David Peters, 30, has been linked to at least 128 different identities which he used to fleece banks, mortgage lenders and government agencies

A master conman thought to be one of Britain's most prolific identity fraudsters is facing jail after admitting an eight-year scam which netted him at least £650,000.

David Peters, 30, has been linked to at least 128 different identities, which he used to fleece banks, mortgage lenders and government agencies.

He stole £168,575 in benefits from three London councils, by claiming to be both tenant and landlord at the same address.

Peters obtained a £250,000 mortgage for a house in Edgware, North-West London, using one of 74 separate driving licences he fraudulently obtained.

He got a second mortgage on a flat in Essex worth £157,495 and took more than £60,000 from Lloyds TSB in a series of bank frauds.

Nigerian Peters, who was also named as Oluseyi Jeremiah Adebayo on court documents, was finally caught last year after City of London police launched an investigation following a tip-off by the DVLA and DWP.

Inquiries in April 2010 discovered he had successfully applied for 74 UK driving licences under false names at various rural post offices across the country, using a checking system where the cashier certifies the documents as genuine.

On other occasions Peters applied for a change of name via deed poll to get his hands on genuine licences.

Through photographic evidence from the DWP, DVLA and banks Peters has been linked to 128 different identities.

Peters yesterday admitted multiple counts of making a false statement with a view to obtaining benefit; possession of criminal property; obtaining property by deception; fraud and possession of false identification documents.

Scales of justice on top of the Old Bailey in London where the case was heard. Peters will be sentenced here on Wednesday

Police inquiries have discovered Peters was running the con from as far back as October 2002 until December of last year.

He will be sentenced at the Old Bailey on Wednesday morning by Judge Gerald Gordon QC.

Following his guilty pleas, Detective Inspector Richard Fisher, from the City of London Police, said: 'This is the biggest case of identity theft we have ever investigated, with banks, mortgage lenders and government agencies all being caught in Peters' web of deception. 

'The sheer number of the fake identities we discovered are evidence of how Peters was a full-time fraudster who was committed to funding a life of excess for himself at the expense of others.

'By working closely with the DWP we have brought an end to Peters days of deceit, while at the same time sending out a warning to anyone else who likes to act as someone they are not as means to commit a crime.' 

Peters fraudulently claimed council tax and housing benefit from Barking and Dagenham council, Brent and Enfield local authorities, he also helped himself to jobseeker's allowance and tax credits from Her Majesty's Revenue and Customs.

He used the driving licences to obtain a mortgage with the Kensington Mortgage Company, worth £256,500 for a property in Edgware, and got a similar deal from Birmingham Midshires for a flat there and one in Dagenham.

Peters, of Edgware, North-West London, admitted a total of 29 charges.

They were six counts of making a false statement with a view to obtaining benefit; 12 counts of possession of criminal property; three counts of obtaining property by deception; six of fraud and four counts of possession of false identification documents.

The charges variously date between October 18, 2002 and December 1, 2010.

He was remanded in custody to be sentenced on Wednesday.
