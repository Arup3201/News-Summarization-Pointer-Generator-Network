A man whose girlfriend refused to marry him because of his 'too small' penis decided to travel the world and talk with men, women and medical experts in a bid to answer the age-old question 'does size matter?'

Patrick Moote, 30, based in Los Angeles, California, filmed all of the conversations he had in destinations including New York, Taiwan and Papua New Guinea, and pieced them together to create a hilariously thought-provoking documentary titled Unhung Hero - out now on DVD.

Explaining why he decided to make his 'less-than-average size member' a public concern, Mr Moote told the New York Post: 'I’ve always gone after things I’m 
insecure about head on [and I] saw an opportunity to answer a question that I 
think was bothering a lot of guys and  . . . me.'

Feeling rejected: Patrick Moote's girlfriend refused to marry him because of his 'too small' penis - so he decided to travel the world in a bid to answer the age-old question 'does size really matter?'

'Even when I was 
telling people about it, I never felt like I was embarrassing myself 
that much. It was almost like doing a service for men in general.'

Mr Moote's one-hour,-24 minute-long film sees him battle humiliation and confusion as he candidly addresses his body hang-up.

He even contacted former girlfriends to get their verdict on his 'package'. On a scale of one to ten, one ex gave it a 'three' and another politely admitted, 'It could [have been] bigger'.

While the woman Mr Moote lost his virginity to recounted it as an unmemorable experience, where she apparently didn't feel a thing.

'I don't remember much, I thought we were just making out,' she says.

Meetings with medical specialists confirm that Mr Moote has a 'below normal' size penis.

Refusing to give the exact size away, Mr Moote told Rolling Stone magazine: 'I did a lot of measuring, and anyone who's done it enough knows that there's anywhere from an 1/8 to 1/4-inch fluctuation on any given day.

'It's such a fickle creature. But if you 
were to say that the average penis is around five-and-a-half inches, I'm
 below average'

'It's such a fickle creature. But if you were to say that the average penis is around five-and-a-half inches, I'm below average.'

However, over a series of interviews with women on the street, Mr Moote was comforted by the fact that while size is an issue for many, it's not a huge one.

Recalling their responses he said: 'You either get, "Oh my God, no! That would never be a problem," 
or "Oh yeah. Big time. That's a big problem." It's almost fifty-fifty.'

He discovered that being 'too big' can be just as much of a problem. In New York he spent an afternoon with Jonah Falcon, who has the world's largest penis, to get a different view on things.

But the full-time actor and comedian says the film isn't just about penis size and is about embracing all kinds of insecurities.

An education: On his travels he learned about various methods people use to make their penises bigger

Shared knowledge: He also talked to men and women about their own sexual experiences

'After some screenings, people told me 
they relate to it but never had a penis, or seen a penis . . . But they 
get it. They understand. Maybe when they were younger they felt like 
they didn't fit what everybody wanted them to be.

'And as soon as they accepted the fact that they are who they are, their life changed astronomically. I love that.'

Others who watched his film would open up to him about their own 'weird' sexual experiences with current or part partners.

'Nowadays, there’s just as much pressure 
on men in terms of body image, who you’re supposed to be, and what 
you're supposed to look like'

'It’s really cool to see people 
let their guard down like that,' he said.

In his film Mr Moote also looked at the lengths some men go to make their penises bigger.

The Taiwanese offered the most dramatic remedies with turtle testicles and reptilian liquor sold as natural enhancers.

One man Mr Moote met tied and lifted 350lbs from the end his manhood in a bid to elongate it. He gave the bizarre practice a shot with 5lbs but did not recommend it.

In Papa New Guinea, he learned of an 'enlarging' oil injection and in Korea he was introduced to Dr. Yoo-Soo  Lee, an esteemed penis enlargement pioneer. He removes fatty tissue from the abdomen of his patients and inserts it into the penis for a natural, enhanced look.

Mr Moote hopes his film will inspire more men to talk openly about their manhood.

'I think it’s a conversation people should have. People are so terrified to talk about it, but something we got into a lot is that all men are insecure about it.

'Nowadays, there’s just as much pressure on men in terms of body image, who you’re supposed to be, and what you’re supposed to look like.' 

Mr Moote came up with the idea to make
 his film after a girlfriend rejected his marriage proposal on a 
Jumbotron at a UCLA basketball game in 2012.

A
 YouTube video of the fail went viral, scoring over ten million hits, 
and Mr Moote’s girlfriend told him that one reason she couldn’t marry 
him was that his penis was too small.

He said that he knew it was an issue in the relationship, but didn't realize it was a deal-breaker.

‘You can tell when, sexually, you're getting somebody's motor 
running or not. I felt like I wasn't - but I didn't think she would run 
out, either,' he said of the incident.

Mr Moote is now back on the dating scene.

Since news of his film broke, he says his penis often becomes a topic of conversation at the dinner table.

'It’s interesting because the times that . . . the penis has come up, I think I’ve set the bar so low, girls are just surprised I even have a penis.

'A girl I had been on a couple of dates with before, it came out and she said, "Oh, my God, it’s not that small."'

He said after his extensive search to find out whether penis size matters in 2013: 'I don’t feel like I have a really small penis, I just know it’s not a particularly impressive or special penis. But it’s my penis, I love it and it’s great.

'But I’m still insecure about it. This wasn’t a magic cure-all for me. It’s not like I’m walking into parties and dropping trou [sic].'
