The force investigating the alleged murder of a teenage girl on a bus a week ago have been called 'insensitive' today after boasting that crime on public transport is down.

West Midlands Police has been forced to apologise for their tweet on the same day the 22-year-old man accused of stabbing 16-year-old Christina Edkins to death on a rush hour service appeared in court.

Phillip Simelane spoke only to confirm his name 
during a 10-minute hearing at Birmingham Crown Court this morning before being remanded in custody on a murder charge.

But only hours earlier West Midlands Police boasted on its 
official Twitter account that bus crime in the area had dropped, horrifying local people upset about Christina's death.

Mistake: A West Midlands Police tweet boasting that bus crime in the area had fallen just one week after Christina Edkins was stabbed to death on a rush hour service

Tragic: Christina Edkins, 16, was in her school 
uniform on the top deck of the bus in Birmingham city centre when she 
was stabbed in the chest, allegedly by Phillip Simelane, 22

Suspect: Detectives released this image of the man who they claimed was their prime suspect

The offending post on the '@WMPolice' 
feed read: "Crime on buses has fallen by 65 per cent over the last five 
years with an average of one crime per 147,000 journeys."

But within minutes, Jayne Childs replied: 'Tell that to the parents of the girl murdered on the No. 9 bus in Birmingham.'

Claire Lycett tweeted: 'I don't think people want to be hearing about the lack of bus crimes so soon after that poor girl!'

Another added: 'Not the best tweet 1 week after what happened, it may be down but its ferocity is escalating,' and 'Bit insensitive following the recent event.'

Apolice spokesman has apologised for the tweet and blamed a computer error for the mistake.

'Apologies if this tweet caused any offence, it was pre-scheduled,' he said, adding: 'We don't want to offend anyone after last week's tragic events.'

Complaints: Following the tweet many people responded to express their disappointment at the official message

Accused Phillip Simelane,
from Walsall, was remanded into the custody of a secure mental health 
unit and will next appear at the same court for a plea hearing on May 
31.

Christina, a pupil at Leasowes High 
School in Halesowen, died after suffering a stab wound to the chest on 
the top deck of a bus in Hagley Road, Edgbaston, Birmingham, on Thursday
March 7.

West Midlands Police were given authority to charge Simelane by the Crown Prosecution Service on Tuesday.

But
he was not formally charged with murder until 9am today, an hour before
he appeared before The Recorder of Birmingham, Judge William Davis QC.

Simelane, wearing a blue, white and 
grey hooded training top, remained impassive throughout today's hearing 
after being asked to confirm his name by the court clerk.

A
dock officer and four police officers stood near the defendant as 
prosecutor Hayley Firman discussed the timetable in the case with the 
judge and defence barrister Regan Peggs.

No
members of Christina's family were present in court during the short 
hearing, which was attended by several police officers working on the 
inquiry.
