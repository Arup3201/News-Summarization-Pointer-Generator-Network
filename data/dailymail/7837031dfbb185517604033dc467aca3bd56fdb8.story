Pledge: Criminal justice major Tyler Lawrence, 19, lost a testicle following a fraternity initiation ritual in which he was struck in his privates

Ohio's Wilmington College has barred historic fraternity Gamma Phi Gamma after a 19-year-old pledge had a testicle surgically removed following a failed Halloween hazing incident.

Tyler Lawrence underwent emergency surgery after students hit him in the groin with a knotted towel on October 30, severely damaging one testicle.

A judicial board has now 'permanently extinguished' the rights of America's oldest fraternity which will no longer be recognized as a Greek organization at the college.

'This is really incongruent with our values what happened that night,' college president Jim Reynolds told Dayton Daily News.

'It’s still an incident that I think has taken a toll on the campus. I think we’re all trying to understand better why something like this happened on our campus.'

The fraternity, which claims to have existed since 1907, appealed the ruling but the punishment was upheld.

The Smoking Gun reported Lawrence was pledging to the Greek organization along with two other young men inside the Gamma Phi Gamma house, dubbed 'Gobbler House,' located off the Wilmington College campus, when he was injured.

The trouble began when the students were 
blindfolded and led down into the basement of 'Gobbler House,' which had
 been filled with about three inches of water.

They were then ordered to lie on the wet floor and pretend they were swimming.

Afterwards, the men were instructed to remove all of their clothes except for the blindfold.

As
 the students stood naked in the basement, one of the fraternity members
 allegedly rubbed a substance similar to the muscle balm Icy Hot on 
their nipples, backs, buttocks and scrotums.

According to a police affidavit, about 20
 Gamma Phi Gamma members either actively participated in the ritual or 
watched from the sidelines.

As part of the initiation, the pledges had Limburger cheese stuffed into their mouths and were ordered to simulate a sexual act with a 'ball of stuffing'.

Things took a dangerous turn when, according to the police affidavit, the fraternity members hit the pledges with towels and shirts that had their ends tied in knots.

Lawrence was struck in the testicles and crumpled to the ground, clutching his injured groin in pain, the affidavit stated.

The criminal justice major was then helped to his feet, and the rite continued with the brothers stuffing bananas soaked in vinegar into the mouths of the three pledges, who were told that they were eating excrement.

Following the 'Gobbler House' initiation, Lawrence complained of severe pain in his groin and was rushed to Clinton Memorial Hospital, where doctors had to cut off a testicle that was damaged in the alleged hazing.

The police affidavit also noted that the teenager suffered bruising and contusions to much of his upper body.

The following day, police officers arrived at the off-campus frat house armed with a search warrant and seized towels with balled ends, icy-hot balm and other items allegedly used in the initiation.

Officials at the Quaker-affiliated liberal arts college suspended the Gamma Phi Gamma fraternity.

Outraged: College president Jim Reynolds called the hazing ritual 'disgusting and despicable'

However at the time of the incident, Lawrence jumped to the fraternity's defense, denying allegations of hazing and calling what happened a 'freak accident'.

‘Everything is being hyped up,’ he told the station WKRC.

Lawrence said he had been accepted into the fraternity after completing the rite of passage, and his parents supported his decision to stay in Gamma Phi Gamma.  

‘We're all just sticking together as brothers do,’ he said. ‘I love every one of those guys in there [and] they all love me.'

Now, the fraternity's sanction means the group can no longer participate in any campus events.

College spokesman Randy Sarvis said the fraternity unsuccessfully appealed the suspension.

It can make a final appeal to college president Jim Reynolds, but it wasn't clear if that would happen.

Police have been conducting a criminal investigation in the case, but they have not disclosed whether criminal charges would be filed.
