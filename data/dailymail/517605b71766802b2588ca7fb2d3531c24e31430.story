A former international rugby star and his wife have had their first child on New Year's Day - after a 'year of hell' where she threw him out and sold his prized possessions on eBay.

Wales and British Lions player Andy Powell, 33, was  taken back by his wife Natasha, 26, because he promised to change his ways after she accused him of cheating, gambling and lying.

Last year Ms Gascoine left him and then tweeted  all of Powell's sexually explicit text messages, torched his clothes and sprayed 'cheat' over his house and pink Mercedes.

But the couple have managed to make a fresh start and yesterday she gave birth to their son Henry at Nevill Hall Hospital in Abergavenny, south Wales.

Fresh start: Welsh rugby star Andy Powell has had his first son with his wife Natasha, less than a year after they broke up and she sold his belongings because she believed he cheated on her

Mr Powell, who was dubbed a 'scrumbag' during their public split, today tweeted today that it was the best day of his life. 

A friend said: 'It has been a hell of a year for Andy and Natasha. But now they have a little one to think about - it is all new for them.' 

The happy news signifies an incredible turnaround for the couple who looked to be heading for divorce.

Natasha Powell had sold her husband's belongings on eBay following suspicions that he had been cheating on her.

She also claimed he paid for the wedding with gambling gains and got drunk before their big day and was nearly arrested.

She auctioned his wedding suit, rugby memorabilia and even romantic letters and cards she had received from him.

Star: Mr Powell has played rugby at the highest level and fans had been able to buy his boots for less than £20 

At the time she said: 'I've been pushed to the absolute limit. It's extreme to sell Andy's things on ebay but I can't get him to take me seriously. 

'Everything about him I don't recognise anymore - he isn't the man I married.' 

But the pair then reunited in May when Natasha discovered she was pregnant and friends have said they are happy.

Office worker Natasha, who had previously suffered two miscarriages, decided to give Andy one last chance for them to be a family.

She said: 'At one point, I blamed him for losing my babies. But he is so happy about the baby and he can't wait to be a dad. I know we can make it work this time. 

'Andy told me wanted to make a go things and get his life back on track.

'He has been very apologetic. I don't know whether it is because I am pregnant or because something clicked in his mind.'

Reflection: A friend said the husband and wife are back on track after 'a hell of a year' and we delighted at the birth of their son

The 6ft 4ins forward was capped 23 times for Wales and toured with the British Lions before turning to rugby league with Wigan. He then moved back to Wales to play for the Newport Gwent Dragons.

After the birth of their first child at around 9am on New Year's Day Powell had to rush off to take his place alongside the Newport Gwent Dragons as they lost to Cardiff Blues.

New mum Natasha was said to be 'recovering well'.
