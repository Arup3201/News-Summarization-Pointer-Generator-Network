She recently returned from a sun-drenched Christmas holiday to her native Barbados.

Showing off her perfectly sculpted body, Rihanna spent her time in swimwear and not much else as she bathed in the sea, sipped beer and jumped on a jet ski.

And the glistening string suit the 25-year-old pop star sported is revealed to be just one of ten made by luxury swimwear firm Charlie by Matthew Zink - costing £600 ($990).

The company sent Rihanna two of its premium Crystal Deco bikinis in each colourway - black and bronze - and the star wasted no time showing them off to her fans.

Rihanna posted a picture of her gift on her Instagram with the caption: 'Yes @charliebymz 
...you can most certainly get it!'

Zink used to work for Tom Ford, 
Carolina Herrera and Victoria's 
Secret Swim - so it's no surpsrise his designs sport a hefty amount of bling.

Each of the bikinis is adorned with 2,638 
individual Swarovski Elements stones, arranged in a vintage-inspired art deco design.

The 'collector's item' suit comes in sizes small and medium and features triangle cups with removable padding. Each one of the very few scheduled to be sold is individually made to order.

To retain its sparkle, the bikini should be handwashed with cold water after each use to remove salt or lotion

The suit comes in sizes small and medium and is adorned with well over 2,000 Swarovski crystals

After her relaxing break, it was back to New York for Rihanna, who wore a satin suit to host an intimate dinner for nearly 20 of her friends on Tuesday night.

She invited friends including Cara Delevingne to dine with her at her new $14.6million New York City penthouse.

And despite wearing the luxe white ensemble 
Rihanna took to the kitchen to help out with the cooking before heading 
out to Jay Z's 40/40 club to see in the New Year in style.
