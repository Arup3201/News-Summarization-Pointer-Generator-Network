Police are seeking an attempted murder charge against the crazed activist they say slashed the U.S ambassador to South Korea while screaming demands for Korean reunification.

The attack Thursday on Mark Lippert, which prompted rival North Korea to gloat about 'knife slashes of justice,' left deep gashes and damaged tendons and nerves. It also raised questions about security in a city normally seen as ultra-safe, despite regular threats of war from Pyongyang.

While an extreme example, the attack is the latest act of political violence in a deeply divided country where some protesters portray their causes as matters of life and death.

On the mend: U.S. Ambassador to South Korea Mark Lippert appeared on Thursday wrapped in a neck bandage  after a man attacked him with a knife during a lecture in Seoul

Suspect: Police are seeking an attempted murder charge against anti-U.S. activist Kim Ki-jong (above) who they say slashed the envoy while screaming demands for Korean reunification

Lippert, 42, was recovering well but still complaining of pain in the wound on his left wrist and a finger where doctors repaired nerve damage, Severance Hospital official Yoon Do-Heum said in televised briefing. 

Doctors will remove the 80 stiches on Lippert's face on Monday or Tuesday and expect him to be out of the hospital by Tuesday or Wednesday. 

Hospital officials say he may experience sensory problems in his left hand for several months.

Police, meanwhile, searched the offices of the suspect, Kim Ki-jong for documents and computer files as they investigated how the attack was planned and whether others were involved

Dumbfounded: Kim was arrested in the immediate aftermath of the attack on Lippert on Thursday morning, which left the ambassador covered in blood 

In custody: The 55-year-old Kim reportedly yelled 'North Korea and South Korea should be unified' before he attacked Ambassador Lippert at the breakfast meeting. Seen above being taken into custody on Thursday

They want to charge Kim with attempted murder, violence against a foreign envoy and business obstruction, and have requested a formal detention warrant.

A further charge of violating South Korea's National Security Law, which bans South Koreans from publicly sympathising with the North Korean government, was being considered.

But the 55-year-old has denied that he intended to kill Lippert. 

As part of their investigation they have also requested Kim's past travels to North Korea — seven times between 1999 and 2007 — during a previous era of inter-Korean cooperation, when Seoul was ruled by a liberal government. 

Kim attempted to build a memorial altar for former North Korean leader Kim Jong Il after his death in December 2011, police said.

Protest: South Korean officials responded swiftly in response to the attacks, beefing up security outside the U.S. Embassy and promising justice. Above, a group of South Korean protesters burn North Korean flags in Seoul during a rally denouncing the attack on Thursday

Pro-American: While South Korea is one of America's strongest allies in Asia, there are factions of the country that are against the strong U.S. military presence. Above, more U.S.-South Korea alliance supporters pictured above on Thursday 

Against the North: South Korean protesters shout slogans as they hold the photos of North Korean leader Kim Jong Un, center and right, the late leaders Kim Jong Il, second from left, and Kim Il Sung, left, during a rally denouncing the attack on the U.S. ambassador on Thursday 

Kim, who has a long history of anti-U.S. protests, said he acted alone in the attack on Lippert. He told police it was meant as a protest of annual U.S.-South Korean military drills that started Monday — exercises that the North has long maintained are preparations for an invasion. 

Kim said the drills, which Seoul and Washington say are purely defensive, ruined efforts for reconciliation between the Koreas, according to police officials.

While most South Koreans look at the U.S. presence favorably, America infuriates some leftists because of its role in Korea's turbulent modern history.

Washington, which backed the South during the 1950-53 Korean War against the communist North, still stations 28,500 troops here, and anti-U.S. activists see the annual military drills with Seoul as a major obstacle to their goal of a unified Korea.

'South and North Korea should be reunified,' Kim shouted as he slashed Lippert with a 10-inch knife, police and witnesses said.

Right before: Lippert pictured above, seated at the breakfast table just prior to being attacked by Kim Thursday morning 

Stained: Police say the ambassador was at his table and about to make a speech when Kim pushed him from behind and then started slashing him with a knife. Above, investigators survey the blood-spattered table on Thursday

Stitched up: South Korean police stand guard outside Gangbuk Samsung hospital where Ambassador Lippert was taken after the attack on Thursday. Doctors say he needed 80 stitches for the wound on his face

South Korean protection: South Korean police patrol outside the U.S. Embassy in Seoul on March 5. The protection of foreign dignitaries and embassies is customarily the responsibility of the host country 

Kim is well-known among police and activists as one of a hard-core group of protesters willing to use violence to highlight their causes.

Police didn't consider the possibility that Kim, who has ties to the Korean Council for Reconciliation and Cooperation, which hosted the breakfast meeting where Lippert was attacked, would show up for the event, according to a Seoul police official who didn't want to be named, citing office rules.

U.S. ambassadors have security details, but their size largely depends on the threat level of the post. Seoul is not considered to be a particularly high threat post despite its proximity to the North Korean border. It's not clear how many guards Lippert had, but they would have been fewer than the ambassadors in most of the Mideast.

Seoul's Foreign Ministry said it was the first time a foreign ambassador stationed in modern South Korea had been injured in a violent attack.

However, the Japanese ambassador narrowly escaped injury in 2010 when Kim threw a piece of concrete at him, according to police. 

Kim, who was protesting Japan's claim to small disputed islands that are occupied by South Korea, hit the ambassador's secretary instead, media reports said, and was sentenced to a three-year suspended prison term over the attack.

The website of the Woorimadang activist group that Kim heads describes the group's long history of anti-U.S. protests. Photos show him and other activists rallying last week in front of the U.S. Embassy in Seoul to protest the U.S.-South Korean military drills, which are to run until the end of April.

North Korea's state-controlled media crowed Thursday that Kim's 'knife slashes of justice' were 'a deserved punishment on war maniac U.S.' and reflected the South Korean people's protests against the U.S. for driving the Korean Peninsula to the brink of war because of the joint military drills.

U.S. Secretary of State John Kerry, in Saudi Arabia for meetings with regional leaders, said the U.S. 'will never be intimidated or deterred by threats or by anybody who harms any American diplomats.'

Activists in Seoul, meanwhile, expressed worries that the attack on Lippert would harm the public image of peaceful protesters, or prompt the conservative government to suppress their activities.

Small to medium-sized demonstrations regularly occur across Seoul, and most are peaceful.

But scuffles with police do break out occasionally, and the burning of effigies of North Korean and Japanese leaders is also common. Some demonstrators have also severed their own fingers, thrown bodily fluids at embassies and tried to self-immolate.

Lippert became ambassador last October and has been a regular presence on social media and in speeches and presentations during his time in Seoul. He's regularly seen walking his Basset Hound, Grigsby, near his residence, not far from where the attack happened. His wife gave birth here and the couple gave their son a Korean middle name. 

While South Korea is one of the U.S.'s closest Asian allies, America has been partially blamed for the severing of Korea into two countries.

In 1910, the Japanese Empire took control of unified Korea which they ruled as a colony through the end of World War II.

When the Empire fell IN 1945, it was decided in a United Nations agreement that Korea be split in half at the 38th parallel.

The U.S. established a trusteeship in the south while the Soviets took over in the north, leading to the creation in 1948 of two separate countries.

However, both sides thought the situation was temporary that that their respective country would ultimately become the sole head of unified Korea.

Cold War tensions between the U.S. and Soviet Union only fueled these ambitions, and in 1950 the North Korean army invaded the south backed by Chinese and Soviet soldiers.

While the South Koreans nearly lost the war in just the first few months of battle, the U.S. helped booster their forces and retake their land.

The fighting was disasterous for both countries, which eventually agreed to an armistance in July 1953.

Since the Korean War is technically ongoing, the U.S. keeps troops in South Korea at the ready.

However, the strong U.S. military presence in South Korean has led to negative sentiments from some citizens who oppose reliance on the West.

Still, South Korea remains one of the most pro-American populations in the world.

According to a 2013 poll, 77 per cent of South Koreans surveyed said they approved of President Obama's leadership - compared to just 45 per cent of Americans at the same time.
