Owen Farrell laughs at the suggestion that professional rugby’s academy system puts too much pressure on players to bulk up.

In a month when the RFU’s treasured academy system has come in for some heavy flak - with Brian O’Driscoll and Nick Easter among the high-profile critics of the northern hemisphere’s apparent obsession with size over skill - Saracens’ ‘Class of 2008’ take a very different view.

‘Yes’ it was tough, they say. ‘Yes’ at times the exercise regime bordered on "madness". But was the pain endured in the gym and on the training ground worth it? They think so.

‘I enjoyed it,’ said Farrell, one of five current Saracens first-team regulars who joined the club in 2008 and went through the Academy together.

‘It was hard, but I needed it.

‘I remember doing twice as much in pre-season as the first team did. We needed to get to where they were. We did two skills sessions a day when they’d do one. We did more weights too.

‘There was a reason for it. We needed to get up to their standard. I enjoyed it and we enjoyed it as a group. As a group we pushed each other pretty well. It’s half the reason that we’re here now.’

There are nods of agreement around the table in a hospitality box at Allianz Park as Farrell’s team-mates and friends George Kruis, Will Fraser, Jamie George and Jackson Wray concur with the England fly-half. 

The demands on a modern-professional rugby player are enormous. No-one doubts that. The game is more physical than it has ever been, the ball is in play longer than it has ever been, and the collisions are greater than they have ever been.

It is a tough, uncompromising professional sport still finding its way both on and off the field after the transition from an amateur game in 1995. Academies are a product of the age.

‘The best thing was the culture we created within the Academy itself,’ said George, who now has 106 first-team appearances.

Farrell is hugely supportive of the demanding academy system which made him the player he is

‘The only pressure was the pressure we put on each other. We set standards of pushing each other hard and doing the extras to try to be the best.

‘That takes the pressure off. You only feel pressure if you don’t work hard enough. The reason we’re all here is because we worked hard when we were younger and are still working hard today.’

As scouting and junior representative selection processes have improved, academies have formed the bridge between life on the inside of professional rugby and life on the outside.

Not every player in the top-flight goes through the system, but it is increasingly rare to find players such as Easter and Gloucester’s Ben Morgan, who slip through the net.

‘It was tough, but a massive part of it was actually not to do with the physical side,’ said flanker Wray, a schoolboy hammer thrower from Essex who took rugby up aged 14 and was signed by Saracens two years later.

‘It’s more to do with the mental side. [Former Saracens coach] Eddie Jones was tough on a lot of people. But it was what made us who we are now. We were in at 6.30 in the morning, getting up at 5am.

‘It was part of the learning experience that you need to go through. We were in first and out last. Always do more. Some of the training sessions were just mental. But they needed to be. You can’t compare now to then.’

All five men agree that, five years after they were in the system, the academies have improved. Whereas they trained in isolation from the first-team, today’s crop - which includes 6ft 5in, 18 stone England U20s captain Maro Itoje - are fully integrated with the first team in order to smooth the transition between the two.

Easter, O’Driscoll and many others argue more emphasis should be placed on skills at the expense of weights lifted.

Earlier this month RFU chief executive Ian Ritchie admitted he was concerned about doping in the sport among junior players with more rugby players currently serving suspensions than any other sport.

None of those suspensions have been in the professional game, but Ritchie’s concern is shared by some.

‘We all go through different stages of growth and if people are putting pressure on you to do it [dope] my message to them is that it’s not worth it,’ says recent England cap Kruis, 24, who shed his nickname of ‘String Bean’ after adding two stone in his first season in the Academy under the direction of strength and conditioning coach and former Academy team-mate Andy Edwards.

Fraser, who would surely be an England regular by now if were not for an horrendous run of injuries, adds: ‘If you want to get big then there are proper ways to do it. As George said, you can get one lad who is huge at 14 and one kid who is tiny who then suddenly overtakes him. You’ve just got to let nature take its course.

Manchester United's 'Class of 92' (from second left after youth team coach Eric Harrison) Ryan Giggs, Nicky Butt, David Beckham, Gary Neville, Phil Neville, Paul Scholes and Terry Cooke proved you could win with kids

‘You’ve got five lads here who have been through a whole junior and senior Academy and not a single one of us have ever come close to it [doping] or had it mentioned to us.’

The five men are firm friends as well as team-mates. Wray recently became the first to have a child when his girlfriend Leanne gave birth to baby Harper.

‘We share each other’s happiness on and off the field,’ George says.

The quintet have a been at the club during a period of unparalleled success which has seen them win the Premiership for the first time in 2011, as well as reaching two other domestic league finals, while last season they reached the Heineken Cup final for the first time in the club’s history, only to be blown away by a Jonny Wilkinson driven Toulon machine.

It hardly stands comparison to Manchester United’s legendary ‘Class of 92’, but with time on their side and an apparent desire to remain at the club they joined as teenagers the potential for this group is enormous.

‘It would be incredible to get to the end of our careers and be able to look back and say: “I’ve spent my entire rugby journey with the same group of lads”.

‘We’re friends for life anyway, but to have that connection throughout our whole careers would be very, very rare and something I’ll try to hold on to.’

The five head in to the New Year with much work to do.

The north Londoners lie fourth in the AvivaPremiership following yesterday’s 25-23 victory at Newcastle while they must win at home to Munster and away to Clermont to stand a realistic chance of qualifying from the toughest of European pools.

But they will do so with the tightest five the Premiership has seen. Five who, fitnessand form permitting,could still be at Allianz Park for many years to come.
