Mesut Ozil might have been in good form since returning from injury this season, but he still needs to be better if Arsenal are to challenge for the title, according to Gunners legend Gilberto Silva.

The Brazilian, a member of the Gunners' Invincibles team, labelled the German 'slow' and says he has to be more decisive.

Gilberto acknowledged Ozil's quality, but insists that he needs to start paying off the faith Arsene Wenger showed by spending £42.5m to bring him to the Emirates Stadium from Real Madrid.

'You speak about Arsenal and how they don't spend big money on a player often but they did with (Mesut) Ozil and it is always a bit risky,' he said.

'Coming from Spain it is tough to adapt, it doesn't always happen straight away.

'I do really like him as a player but sometimes in the game he does look quite slow, although he has that quality to change the game.

'He can be more decisive for Arsenal for the quality he has, he can be much more decisive for the club.

Arsenal have not won the Premier League in the 11 years since Gilberto and his team-mates went unbeaten, and the 38-year-old believes they still don't have the financial firepower to challege Chelsea and Manchester City.

Gilberto was a key member of the Arsenal team that went an entire Premier League season unbeaten in 2004

But Gilberto also stressed that the club should be aiming for the title, and given time Arsene Wenger can lead his current squad to glory. 

'Arsenal hasn't been able to compete with Chelsea and Manchester City for a few years because they spend money on big names and this is not the Arsenal culture', said Gilberto.

'They don't spend a lot of money to sign players but apart from that it is not easy to find a way to get back on track to win titles.

Ozil is the Gunners record signing, but in general the club has not tried to compete with rich clubs financially

The German playmaker will need to improve if Arsenal are to mount a serious title challenge, says Gilberto

'It was important for them last season that they won the FA Cup but a team like Arsenal need more and I hope they find a way to achieve what they always look for.

'If you look at Chelsea, they spent a lot of money on a player like Diego Costa and he has settled really well and is scoring lots of goals, that has worked for them but it is not as easy for Arsenal.

'If the players concentrate on their job and pull together they can form a strong team and try to feel good in their play.

'Sometimes people expect quick results but it doesn't always work like that.' 

Brazil v Chile is on March 29 at 3pm at the Emirates Stadium in London. Tickets are still available from £30 Adults/£15 Concessions at www.arsenal.com/tickets
