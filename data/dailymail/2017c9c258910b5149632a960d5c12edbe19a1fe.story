The man suspected of abducting University of Virginia student Hannah Graham has pleaded not guilty to attempted capital murder, rape and abduction in connection with an unrelated case.

Jesse Matthew, 32, made his first in-person court appearance in Fairfax County, Virginia, on Friday morning following the alleged attack on a 26-year-old woman in September 2005.

The victim had  been walking home from a grocery store when she was reportedly dragged into a wooden area and sexually assaulted. Her attacker ran away after being startled by a passerby.

Donning a green jail jumpsuit and with his dreadlocks tied back, Matthew bowed his head as he entered a not guilty plea in the nine-year-old case. The judge set a trial date for March 9, 2015.

Matthew, from Virginia, was arrested and charged two months ago with abducting 18-year-old Miss Graham, who went missing in Charlottesville after leaving a bar at around 2am on September 13.

The remains of the sophomore, who prosecutors say was unaware that Matthew was following her,  were found near the city in mid-October following a month-long search, according to NBC 4.

Authorities claim DNA evidence links Matthew to the 2005 assault in Fairfax, as well as the 2009 disappearance and death of Virginia Tech student Morgan Harrington.

Following Friday's 10-minute hearing, Fairfax County Commonwealth's Attorney Ray Morrogh said the victim in the 2005 attack now lives in India, but will come back to the U.S. to testify at Matthew's trial.

'It's fair to say she looks forward to a final resolution,' Mr Morrogh said. 'I am grateful to her for her continued cooperation.' Circuit Court Judge David Schell will preside over the trial.

As news of Miss Graham's disappearance hit the headlines earlier this year, reports emerged that the suspect had been accused of sexual assault multiple times in the past 12 years.

He first came to police attention when the first sexual assault allegation was made against him at Liberty University on October 17, 2002, when a woman accused him of raping her on campus.

The allegation was investigated by Lynchburg Police and turned over to the prosecutor's office - but the woman declined to press charges and no witnesses could be found, so the case was dropped.

His last day at the school was the day the accusation was made, the Washington Post reported.

Matthew then attended Christopher Newport University, where he was accused of another sexual assault on September 7, 2003.

Discovery: Graham's remains were found in a shallow grave in this abandoned property in mid-October

Five days after the alleged incident, Matthew quit the school's football team and a month after, he left the school. It is not yet clear how this second incident was resolved.

Last month, Matthew made his first court appearance in the 2005 case via videolink in Charlottesville. Earlier this week, he was transferred to Fairfax Jail ahead of his in-person appearance.

He will now be returned to Charlottesville for a preliminary hearing on December 5 in relation to the alleged abduction of Miss Graham with the intent to defile. He is not yet facing murder charges.

On Friday, Albemarle County Sheriff Chip Harding said Miss Graham's death could have been avoided if Virginia would collect DNA for misdemeanor convictions as well as felonies.

Mr Harding said that had authorities collected DNA from Matthew following a 2010 misdemeanor trespassing conviction, it would have generated a hit that would have linked him to the Fairfax case and the Harrington case years before Graham was killed.

On Friday, Mr Morrogh said he agreed about the benefits of expanding DNA collection, describing DNA as 'no different than a fingerprint' and saying: 'We're talking about saving lives here.

Lat month, Matthew's attorney, James Camblos, said he had reason to question his client's sanity and requested a psychiatric evaluation. A judge is yet to reject or permit his request.

The sexual assault and abduction cases are ongoing.
