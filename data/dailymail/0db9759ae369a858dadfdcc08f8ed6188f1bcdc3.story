A college basketball player was left red-faced last night after he accidentally scored a winning basket for the rival team.

Jacob Kurtz, 22, who plays for the Florida Gators, performed the blunder with just three seconds left on the clock.

Footage from the game at the Donald L. Tucker Center in Tallahassee, Florida, shows the 6ft 6in sportsman catching the ball at the wrong angle as he jumps up to defend the net from a Florida State Seminoles player. 

 

The ball swiftly bounces off his fingertips and flies through the net, giving the Florida State Seminoles a 65-63 win. 

'That's got to be one of the strangest endings you'll ever see,' the commentator says as Kurtz puts his vest over his head in a bid to hide his embarrassment.

Meanwhile, Florida State Seminoles fans can be heard cheering in the background with the players rejoicing.
