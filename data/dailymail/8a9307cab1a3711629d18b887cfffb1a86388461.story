Jordan Higgins (pictured), son of former world champion Alex Higgins, has been jailed for 18 months after admitting robbery

The son of former world snooker champion Alex 'Hurricane' Higgins has been jailed today for carrying out a dawn robbery on a newsagents.

Jordan Higgins, 31, was high on drink and drugs when he snatched a haul of cigarettes worth £1,500 from a display shelf after he and a masked accomplice burst into the shop  in Cheadle, Greater Manchester.

During the attack Higgins stormed round the back of the counter and grabbed Steven Gee by the throat and pushed him onto a stool. 

He then emptied the cigarettes off the shelves into a duvet cover before running off and escaping in a getaway car. He was arrested after his DNA was matched to the crime scene.

The robbery last January occurred after Higgins - who has a string of convictions - battled a lengthy drug and alcohol problem during which he was admitted to a rehabilitation clinic at the age of just 14. 

He was also said to have struggled living in the shadow of his late father who died aged 61 in 2010 after battling throat cancer.

At Minshull Street Crown Court today, the late snooker star's former wife Lynn and daughter Lauren wept in the public gallery as Jordan - who was given the middle name Alexander - was locked away for 18 months after admitting robbery.

Sentencing Judge John Potter told him: 'Regrettably this is not the first time you find yourself standing in the dock of a criminal court for a criminal offence. 

'You do have previous convictions recorded against you which I have considered carefully including previous for alcohol, causing loss to others by way of damage and assault.

'You knew what was going on and knew the robbery was to take place. You have targeted somebody simply trying to earn a living. 

'He was alone so was vulnerable. You ran away and as you did you discarded your scarf and glove and further analysis on the DNA was recovered linking you to the commission of the offence.

'I accept your remorse is now genuine and at the time you were riddled with the associated difficulties and problems that alcohol and drug addiction brings to people but as you know that is absolutely no excuse for your behaviour. 

'I accept you are somebody who has had a difficult upbringing and you have had to live in the glare of publicity with a father, that according to the testimonials, was hardly the proper role model to a son. 

'But that is also no excuse to target Mr Gee as you did. I view this so serious only immediate custody is appropriate.'

Earlier Andrew Long prosecuting said the robbery began when Higgins, from Cheadle, and his accomplice drew up in a car and burst in wearing scarves over their faces.

He added: 'The defendant grabbed Mr Gee by the throat and walked him backwards squeezing his throat and dragged him to a stool behind the counter. 

'The two men then set about trying to steal the cigarettes. The other man got a duvet and put the cigarettes in and both men pulled the shelf off the display and took it towards the car. 

'Mr Gee pressed the silent alarm and when they left the shop he locked them out. They left the shop with the tray, leaving the duvet behind with around £1,500 of cigarettes.

'They got back in the car and drove away at speed but crashed it. The defendant was the passenger in the car which was bearing false registration plates. 

'The two men ran through the gardens and the police were able to follow where some items were discarded including the scarf worn by the defendant. The passenger side airbag was also deployed. The glove, mask and airbag had the defendant's DNA on.'

In mitigation defence counsel Estelle Parkhouse said: 'He was under the influence of drugs and alcohol and the CCTV demonstrates this is a less sophisticated robbery. 

'He wasn't thinking very clearly. Prior to Christmas he lost the employment he had for three years and in addition his long term relationship had broken down. 

'He then started using drugs and alcohol to block out the difficulties.

She added: 'He has lived in the shadow of his father's fame and success and unfortunately it has been a life of constant scrutiny. The pressures placed upon him have been difficult to bear. At 14 years old he went to the Priory for misuse of alcohol.

'After that, unfortunately, his misuse escalated and he started using Class A drugs. This offence is wholly out of character.

She went on to explain how he had led a 'troubled childhood that was 'far from a charmed existence.

'His father's behaviour is described in the letters by his sister and mum. He was exposed to alcohol and drugs from an early age and has an addictive personality but since the offence he has addressed his problem with drugs.

'He has a very close relationship with his mother and sister and an incredibly close relationship with his grandparents who are in their 80s. 

'His grandfather was by far a more appropriate father figure than his father was. This offence wasn't committed because he needed money but he can't provide an explanation as to why he got involved. He is disgusted by his behaviour and is genuinely sorry for the harm caused.'

After the case Mr Gee, 51, described the 'very scary' experience of being robbed in his shop.

'I didn't know if they had weapons or if they were prepared to really hurt me or what. The police were here within minutes but I was very shaken up,' he said.

'I was very surprised more than anything when I heard who it was who did it. Unfortunately the way his dad's life panned out could have affected this young man. Losing any loved one affects people differently. In a way I feel sorry for him.'

Jordan was born a year after his father - who came to be known as 'The People's Champion' - won the World Snooker Championship in 1982 during which the star sobbed as he hugged then-wife Lynne and one-year-old daughter Lauren.

The Hurricane had already been World Champion and runner-up in 1976 and 1980. He won the UK Championship in 1983 and the Masters in 1978 and 1981, making him one of nine players to have completed snooker's Triple Crown. 

He was also World Doubles champion with Jimmy White in 1984, and won the World Cup three times with the All Ireland team.

But tragically Higgins snr's career subsequently crumbled under a litany of fines, bans and court-cases. 

He was left penniless after losing his luxury house in Cheshire to the taxman and was eventually stopped from seeing Jordan and Lauren following his divorce with Lynn.

He was a heavy smoker, struggled with drinking and gambling and admitted to using cocaine and marijuana.

Diagnosed with throat cancer in 1998, Higgins died of the illness in his Belfast home on 24 July 2010. Jordan was a pallbearer at his father's funeral alongside snooker stars Jimmy White and Ken Doherty.
