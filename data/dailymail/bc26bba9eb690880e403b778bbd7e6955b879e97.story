Britain is continuing to export millions of pounds worth of  military equipment to Russia despite concerns Moscow is arming separatist rebels in Ukraine, MPs have warned.

The Commons Committees on Arms Export Controls (CAEC) have revealed that 251 export licences for the sale to Russia of controlled goods worth at least £132million remain in place.

Among the licences which remain valid are permits covering sniper rifles, night sights, small arms ammunition, gun mountings, body armour, military communications equipment and 'equipment employing cryptography'.

Despite a promise in March by the then foreign secretary William Hague to stop military sales to Russia which could be used against Ukraine, the committees said that just 31 licences had been revoked.

Britain is still selling more than £100million worth of military equipment to Russia despite calls for sanctions. Among the items that are still being sent to the country are sniper rifles,  ammunition and body armour

The disclosure comes after Prime Minister David Cameron yesterday strongly criticised European countries such as France which continue to pursue defence sales to Russia despite Moscow’s backing for the separatists.

CAEC chairman Sir John Stanley said that the relatively small number of licences which had been withdrawn exposed the weakness of Mr Hague’s original promise, which referred only to equipment which could be deployed against Ukraine and did not cover Russia’s wider defence requirements.

While he said that Britain had been in the vanguard of European countries in taking action to curb defence sales to Russia, it had still not gone far enough.

'Russia is an authoritarian regime. We should have been applying a more cautious approach for some time in regard to Russia,' he said.

Sir John has now written to new Foreign Secretary Philip Hammond asking if he will be suspending or revoking the remaining licences.

The CAEC also strongly criticised the award of licences for the export of chemicals which could be used in the manufacture of chemical weapons to Syria.

It said the award by the previous Labour government of five licences for the export of sodium fluoride had been 'highly questionable', while the decision of the current Government to issue a further two licences for sodium and potassium fluoride after the civil war had begun was irresponsible.

It said that the current Government’s claim that it had no grounds to refuse the licences was 'grossly inaccurate'.

The CAEC - which is made up of the Commons Foreign Affairs, Defence, International Development and Business, Innovation and Skills committees - also expressed concern that the Government had watered down its policy on the export of equipment to countries where there were concerns that it could be used for internal repression.

It is feared Russia is arming pro-Kremlin rebels in eastern Ukraine (pictured), who are widely believed to be behind the shooting down of Malaysian Airways flight MH17 last week

It said that a 'broad' test that an export licence should not be issued if there was 'concern' the equipment could be used for internal repression had been dropped from the latest set of Government guidelines issued earlier this year.

Only the 'narrow' test that there had to be a 'clear risk' of repression remained.

In evidence to the CAEC, Business Secretary Vince Cable insisted the policy had not changed, however the committee said that he had been 'directly contradicted' by the Labour former foreign minister Peter Hain who was responsible for issuing the previous set of guidelines in 2000.

'We consider there has been a significant change of policy. We don’t accept that there has been no change of policy,' Sir John said.

A UK Government spokesperson said: 'This Government has not approved any licences for the export of rifles or ammunition to the Russian military. 

'Export licences for rifles and ammunitions cover hunting and sporting rifles supplied to private individuals and to authorised dealers for resale.

'We do not believe that there is a credible risk that these weapons will be diverted for use by the Russian military.'
