Odell Beckham Jnr grabbed the limelight in a record-breaking rookie season, which included that unforgettable one-handed touchdown catch.

And the New York Giants receiver also displayed his skills with a round ball at Spurs' training ground.

On his first trip outside the United States, the 22-year-old reflected on the day - and the play - that changed his life.

'It's just never going to be the same. Made a play like that early in my career and that night from then on, everything was just different.

Beckham Jnr showcased his tremendous leap

'It was like being your birthday on steroids. Everybody's texting you through the roof,' he told Sky Sports News.

The Giants lost to the Dallas Cowboys on November 23, but it was Beckham Jnr's reception which had the world talking.

'That is absolutely impossible what he just did,' NBC’s Cris Collinsworth said on Sunday Night Football. 'That may be the greatest catch I’ve ever seen in my life.'

Despite only playing 12 games and not being 100 per cent fit, Beckham Jnr walked away with the offensive rookie of the year award. 

'Usually a one-handed catch is something that's reactive. Like you're reacting to the ball and you feel as if that's the only thing you can do is to make a fast twitch reaction and stick your hand up,' Beckham Jnr continued.

'I was trying to fight off the defender. It was a last minute thing where I just kind of jumped for it.'

Fellow countryman Brad Friedel joined Beckham Jnr for a kickabout and paid tribute to the growth of the NFL in the UK. 

'I've been over here for 23 years and when I first came over you got highlights every now and again but this city and this country is ready for a full-time team,' said Spurs' veteran keeper.

'When all the games are announced, tickets sell-out in minutes. It's no problem at all selling out Wembley.'
