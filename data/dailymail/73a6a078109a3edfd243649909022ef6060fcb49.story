Two sisters in Philadelphia who learned they would be mothers within a day of one another gave both gave birth to sons with the same synchronicity. 

Brigid Bink, a marketing manager at Iron Hill Brewery & Restaurant, went into labor first earlier this week. 

When her sister, Emily Whitaker, visited her in the hospital, she was prepared to follow her sister's lead. They shared a due date of September 15.

Emily Whitaker, left, gave birth to her son Owen on Thursday morning, about 22 hours after her sister Brigid Bink had Jack. Over the preceding nine months, they shared the joys of becoming moms as their bellies slowly ballooned

'I brought my hospital bag thinking, "Okay this will be it,"' Whitaker told KGO-TV.

Bink gave birth to her son Jack on Wednesday morning at 7:34am at Abington Memorial Hospital. He weighed seven pounds and six ounces.

Whitaker, a middle school teacher, was sent home but went into labor soon after and about 22 hours later gave birth to her own son, Owen, who weighed eight pounds and nine ounces.

'When she called me this morning and told me she had a boy too, I just started bawling,' Bink said. .

'It's still just so surreal - the whole thing is surreal,' she added. 'I can't believe I am a mom. I can't believe my little sister is a mom.'

The sisters said they have big plans for the first cousins, who they expect to be very close.

'I see them playing sports together - going to school together,' Whitaker said. 

'We got the starting shortstop and the second baseman for the Phillies in 2034 now,' said Lee Bink, Brigid's husband.

It wasn't only their births that were in sync.  

Last winter, Bink found out she and she and her husband were going to have their first child. 

Whitaker and her husband Colin learned she was pregnant with their first the very next day.  

The sisters spent the next nine months learning how to be moms together as their bellies slowly ballooned. 

'I don't think I could have done this pregnancy without her,' Whitaker said.

Whitaker and her husband Colin learned they were pregnant also just one day after Bink and Lee her husband found out
