Carl Froch’s hopes of a dream Las Vegas swansong hinge on Julio Cesar Chavez Jnr accepting the challenge.

Froch, who was made a freeman of Nottingham on Thursday night, is desperate to finish his career in Sin City.

And Chavez’s promoter Bob Arum has offered the former middleweight world champion the fight for early next year.

‘We’ve offered Chavez Jnr a fight with Froch,’ Arum told Fight Hub. 

‘If he does that fight he’s finished with the contract. We’re waiting to hear back from him.’

Should Chavez accept the fight, it is expected to take place before the end of January.

But the 28-year-old has not fought since March and his contractual situation has proved a stubborn obstacle in the past.

Chavez was supposed to face middleweight knockout artist Gennady Golovkin last July but talks broke down.

Chavez refused to sign a contract extension with Arum’s Top Rank promotional company as part of the deal, and then rejected a second offer of a smaller purse but without the extension.

Earlier this week, Froch’s promoter Eddie Hearn revealed he was more confident than ever that the fight will happen.

Writing in his Sportsmail column, he said: ‘Having spent a lot of time with Carl Froch recently, it’s been difficult to ignore his burning desire to box in Las Vegas.

‘As we all know, anything can happen in boxing, but talks re-opened last week with the Julio Cesar Chavez Jnr camp and I am hopeful that a fight can be made in Las Vegas.

‘For Carl, it has always been his dream to fight in Vegas so it is something we will try hard to finalise.

‘It had seemingly died in the water, but I took a call from Top Rank on Saturday and they wanted to explore the possibilities further.

‘I am now expecting to be on a conference call with Chavez’s representatives later this week where we will try to make more progress.’

Should an agreement be reached, Froch would likely be forced to vacate his IBF title.

That would leave his mandatory challenger James DeGale free to fight for the vacant belt.
