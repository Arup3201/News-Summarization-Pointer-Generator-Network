David Beckham awoke to a burgeoning backlash over his move to French club Paris St Germain this morning, but it didn't stop him making a group of builders' day by signing football shirts for their children.

The 37-year-old football star was dubbed a 'third-hand Rolls Royce' in France today as the media began to question the bizarre deal which has brought him to the club on a five-month contract.

Beckham has pledged to play 'for free', with all of his £3million plus wages going to a children's charity in the French capital, but many wondered what effect this would have on his teammates.

Beckham will still be receiving a multi-million pounds share of all merchandise connected with his brand.

The
club is also paying Beckham's accommodation and security during his 
time in the French capital - a figure which will be well into the high 
six figures.

'A special status can feed jealousy,'
reads Le Figaro, which adds: 'In a dressing room where the offensive 
egos of players are struggling to live, the arrival of a third hand 
Rolls Royce which becomes the main focus of media fascination risks 
causing envy, while feeding a climate of discord.'

The paper also suggests that 
players will be 'annoyed' by Beckham and his wife Victoria regularly 
appearing in glossy celebrity magazines.

Today, the former Spice Girl said: 'Myself and the children are incredibly proud and supportive of David,' confirming that 'we are excited about spending time in Paris.'

Le Monde said that, despite his skill and glamour, Beckham, had been 'admitted into the jet-set, he has also adopted their bad habits - bodyguards, private planes, huge properties protected by electric gates, PR magicians, mediocre autobiographies to their glory.'

Over the last 18 months PSG has spent more than £200million in transfer fees, outspending every other club in Europe.

While Beckham has suggested he will stay in a city hotel for most of his time in Paris, the club is known to have made a home available to him and his family on the outskirts of the capital.

PSG is ultimately funded by the oil rich state of Qatar, which is controversially investing billions in France.

Earlier this week former President Nicolas Sarkozy was accused of holding a secret meeting in November 2010 which influenced the decision by football's governing body to award the 2022 football World Cup to Qatar.

In a scandal dubbed 'Qatargate', the magazine France Football said that 'acts of collusion and corruption' were behind the much-criticised FIFA decision to award the competition to the tiny country.

Mr Sarkozy, who is at the centre of a number of corruption enquiries in France, is one of PSG's most famous fans, and is regularly seen at home games.

Despite the criticism of his transfer, Beckham on Thursday played down a suggestion that he will become the 'grandpa' of France's Ligue 1.

Beckham said: 'It feels very good - to be in Paris, to be at a club like this, to be the elder statesman ... I'm very proud of all that.

'No matter what my age is, I still feel 21 years old - most days, at least. My fitness will not take long to get up to speed and I've been training with Arsenal. I'll get up to speed.'
