A Texas mother-of-four is going to face manslaughter charges for the deaths of two of her children after slamming her vehicle into two parked cars last night.

Police said that 30-year-old Crytsal Suniga's blood alcohol was twice the legal limit when she lost control of her SUV and crashed near Gilbert  Elementary School on East Pioneer Drive in Irving, Texas, about 8pm on Sunday night.

Suniga's two sons - identified by family members as Angel Reyes, 14, and Ricardo Hernandez, 10 - died at the scene, police spokesman James McLellan told WFAA.

Her 16-year-old son's pelvis was crushed and her daughter was also injured in the collision and officers said Suniga could have been driving at up to three-times the speed limit.

'They are only estimates at the moment; it could be anywhere from 60-70 miles per hour, up to 90-100 miles per hour, but the investigation is still in the early stages,' Irving Police Officer James McLellan said on Sunday.

Police said Suniga is currently being treated for unspecified injuries at the Parkland Memorial Hospital in Dallas.

Witness Noe Osuna said that the scene of the crash was horrifying.

'We heard a little girl screaming for help, and we ran with my brothers to try to get people out,' said Osuna to NBC DFW.

'We didn’t know until the little girl said that there were still two kids in the car, that’s when we tried to break the window, open the other windows. That’s when we saw the bodies,' he said.

Police have said that all the children were wearing seatbelts.

'In this case, that didn’t seem to restrain them enough to keep them from being partially ejected and killed,' said Officer McLellan.

Investigators have said that Suniga's blood alcohol level was measured at 0.18 - which is twice the legal limit.

Irving police said she is charged with two counts of intoxication manslaughter and two counts of injury to a child as well.

'Certainly it’s tragic,' McLellan said to The Dallas Morning News. 'Here’s someone who caused the death of her two children. It was completely avoidable and unnecessary, but she still needs to be held accountable.'

Another witness to the crash, Eric Sorto, said he heard what sounded like a bomb going off outside his home when Suniga crashed into the cars.

His father's pickup truck was damaged and the force of the impact sent the tailgate onto the roof of his home.

'It was like a nightmare,' he said, 'like seeing something you’d see in a movie.'

Adan Ozuna, who lives next door to Sorto, said Suniga's 12-year-old daughter girl kept screaming for him to help her brothers who were pinned under the car.

'We tried to lift the car to try to save them, but the SUV was too heavy,' he said.

'We couldn’t move it.'

Leslie Weaver, a spokeswoman for the Irving Independent School District, said the two boy who died attended Gilbert Elementary School and Austin Middle school. Grief counselors will be at each location on Monday, she said.
