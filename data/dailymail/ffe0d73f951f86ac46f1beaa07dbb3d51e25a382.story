Embarrassing: Christina Marie Searcy is booked into Precinct 4 after her meth pipe was removed

One woman's panicked attempt to hide a meth pipe in her vagina during a drugs bust last week ended in an embarrassing trip to a Texas emergency room.

On Friday, around 6pm, Christina Marie Searcy, 36, was pulled over along with three other friends after a Montgomery County deputy responded to a report of fraud committed by them.

The deputy reported he smelled marijuana from their van and when driver Kevin Gene Hales, 20, exited the vehicle, a joint fell out with him.

When the van was searched, a coin purse containing several bags of cocaine was also found and Hales, Searcy, Kimberly Kinn and Melinda Robertson were taken into custody.

They were warned when they were booked into jail that if they didn't declare all drugs on their bodies they would face additional charges.

At this point Kinn revealed she had a pipe in her bra, which was tested for methamphetamine, and proved positive.

Searcy then admitted to having a pipe reports the Montgometry County Police Reporter.

However, she also confessed the pipe was not in her bra but in her vagina. 

Officers let her try and remove it, but she discovered to her dismay it was stuck.

An ambulance was called and Searcy was taken to Kingwood Emergency Room and the pipe was successfully removed.

It was then tested and proved positive for methamphetamine.
