Newsagent Jarrett Rivers  made headlines when he scored Blyth Spartans' FA Cup winner against Hartlepool United, and it has earned the 21-year-old the offer of his first professional contract.

Oldham Athletic missed out on convicted rapist Ched Evans last week but turned their attention to Rivers by allowing the winger that works in his mother's newsagents to have a week's trial.

And Blyth manager Tom Wade confirmed a different League One club made a bid for Rivers on Monday night after his 90th-minute winner during a televised 2-1 win over Hartlepool in December.

Five other clubs from League One and Two are chasing the former Middlesbrough academy player after Rivers impressed in the next round during Blyth's 3-2 FA Cup defeat against Birmingham City. 

He single-handedly created the opening goal during that match with a run into the box, and manager Wade feels recognition from professional clubs is the least his starlet deserves.

'He's a quiet lad. He's not a big-time Charlie,' Wade told Sportsmail on Tuesday. 'He scored his winner against Hartlepool in the last couple of minutes and it never got to his head.

'The trial so far is going really well. There has been a bid put in from another club, which came last night. Then there's another five clubs after him.

'There's definitely a bid on the table now, which I discussed last night, and that's a League One side.

'I just think he's a pretty positive player. He's got great feet, great pace, he can score goals. He can play through the middle, play on the right-hand side or left-hand side, and his commitment to hard work is second to none. 

'He's got the full package. He just needs to take the chance and it looks like he will.'

Oldham abandoned their attempts to sign controversial striker Evans after threats to club staff. The League One club are currently 13th and five points adrift of the play-offs.
