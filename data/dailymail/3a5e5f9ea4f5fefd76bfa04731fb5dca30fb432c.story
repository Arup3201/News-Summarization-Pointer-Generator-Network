Police say a 77-year-old man who died from injuries sustained in a fall at his darkened apartment building has become the latest victim of Superstorm Sandy - raising the city's death toll related to the storm to 43.

Authorities say Albert McSwain died on Saturday. He was found Oct. 31 at the bottom of the steps of his building on Rockway Beach Boulevard. The building had no power. He had injuries to his head and was paralyzed from the neck down and was taken to the hospital.

Police say there have been 23 storm-related deaths on Staten Island; 11 in Queens; seven in Brooklyn, and two in Manhattan.

Tragic find: Eleven days after Hurricane Sandy devastated the northeast, the 42nd victim has been found in a 66-year-old man who lived alone in this Staten Island house

A 66-year-old man who lived alone has
been found drowned almost two weeks after super storm Sandy, bringing 
the death toll to 42.

David Maxwell was found by police in his living room with his cat which had also drowned at the yellow Midland Beach home.

'It's so horrible,' his neighbour Dorothy Matthews, 71, told the New York Post. 'He was alone in the world except for his cat and his partner in the nursing home.'

Friends said Mr Maxwell was a former Marine who served in Vietnam.

The neighborhood is still flooded with trash and other waste in the storm's aftermath. Mrs Matthews said that a foul smell may have been the only thing that sent officers in to check on him.

'I don't know who called it in, but it was probably someone who thought the smell came from rotting flesh,' she said.

After his partner, 72-year-old James McCormick suffered a stroke placing him in a nursing home, a neighbor said that he was still Mr Maxwell's whole life whom he visited as much as he could.

A nursing home caretaker who arrived at the home on his partnerâ€™s behalf expressed her grief saying that they had wondered why he hadn't visited or called.

'He shouldn't have been left here for so long,' Irene Fontanez told the Post.

Neighbours said they had attempted to check in with Mr Maxwell before the storm hit but when they knocked on his door, no one answered They said they figured he had already left.

'He was such a lovely, sweet man. His partner James was his whole life,' neighbour Katherine Kayvolt, 75, told the Post.

'He thought the storm wasn't going to be as bad as it was. He underestimated it. And this is what happened to him.'
