Two people have been killed in a violent two-day stand off between anti-government protesters and police in Istanbul.

Riot police used water cannons and teargas to fight with more than a dozen youths on Thursday and Friday who hurled stones and firebombs.

One man - described as a bystander and not a demonstrator - was shot and died in the chaos in Okmeydani, a restive Istanbul neighborhood home to a large communities of Alevis, an offshoot of Shiite Islam. Officials announced on Friday that a second man had died.

Clash: A group of demonstrators marching through Sarkkahvesi area of Okmeydani clash with the police Friday

Clashes between police and a group of demonstrators protesting Soma coal mine tragedy in western Turkey, as well as the death of an Istanbul teenager, Berkin Elvan, who was fatally injured during 2013's Gezi Park protests, left two dead

The heightened tension in the capital came as the anniversary of nationwide protests last summer approaches. During the disturbances, a 15-year-old boy,
 Berkin Elvan, was hit in the head by a police tear-gas canister and died in March without regaining 
consciousness.

Tens of thousands of people came to his funeral.

The protests also focused on 301 people who were killed in a coal mine disaster last week in the western town of Soma.

On Friday, Turkey Prime Minister Recep Tayyip Erdogan spoke out in support of police after the two deaths shook the nation, saying that he was 'amazed' by the patience of law enforcement.

'We won't remain silent against the 
blood mongers who use (the mine disaster) as an excuse to break, ravage,
 attack police and commit murder,' Erdogan said in a speech to members 
of his ruling party.

'Do you expect police to stand idly by and watch? I am amazed at their patience.'

As for Elvan, Erdogan said: 'Are we to hold a ceremony every time there's a death? He died and it's over.'

News of the death on Thursday triggered 
more clashes in the same neighborhood, injuring at least nine people 
including a man who died in a hospital of a severe injury on Friday, 
Istanbul Governor Huseyin Avni Mutlu told reporters.

Mutlu earlier identified the dead 
bystander as 30-year-old Ugur Kurt. He was reportedly killed by a stray 
bullet as he attended a relative's funeral.

Police investigators are trying to identify the person who fired the bullet. Turkey's state news agency confirmed Friday that the police had handed in their firearms as part of an investigation into Mr Kurt's death.

Grim photographs and security footage show the victim collapse to the ground with blood coming from his head as a crowd gathers around him.

Another civilian and seven policemen were injured Thursday, some of them by shrapnel from a makeshift bomb.

Mutlu confirmed that police had used a firearm in response to a Molotov cocktail setting one of their vehicle's ablaze.

The second man who died was not identified.
