Bobby Zamora admits the big clubs must be crazy if they’re not considering a swoop for his Queens Park Rangers strike partner Charlie Austin.

Austin has 12 goals in 16 games in his first Barclays Premier League campaign and, with the transfer window about to open, Rangers are desperately trying to extend his contract - aware that his goals could be the difference between survival and relegation.

‘As a club, we need to tie him down and get him a new deal,’ said Zamora. ‘Without a doubt other clubs will be looking at him and if they’re not they’re crazy because he can get you that goal.

‘He did well for us last year and even though it’s been a step up we know what he can do. 

'He wasn’t scoring wonder-goals, going past four or five people; they’re striker’s goals, finisher’s goals and if you’ve got that ability, you can do it at any level.’

Like Austin, Zamora took the scenic route from non-League to the top flight. ‘It’s a great route and a great story,’ added the 33-year-old. ‘It gives you extra hunger. It’s brilliant and I’m pleased for him.’

All but two of Austin’s goals this season have come at Loftus Road, where Rangers return to take on Crystal Palace today. 

Without a point in nine away games, it will be vital for Harry Redknapp’s team to continue winning at home.

‘Maybe it’s a psychological problem for everyone that comes to our place,’ said Zamora, reversing the idea of a mental block.

‘We’ve got a good record and it’s not a nice place to come really is it, in terms of the changing rooms and how close the crowd are.

‘We know it will change away from home at some stage.’

Sunday's game against Palace is another crucial fixture for both teams and Redknapp’s team selection on Boxing Day for the 2-1 defeat at Arsenal had this game in mind.

‘One or two can’t play two in three days,’ said the QPR boss, citing Zamora, who came on as a substitute at the Emirates Stadium, and his 30-something defenders Richard Dunne and Clint Hill, who should return.

Leroy Fer did not play at Arsenal because he was on four bookings and could not risk missing the Palace game through suspension, and Redknapp gave Joey Barton ‘half a chance’ of being fit after a slight hamstring problem.

‘Every time I’ve seen Palace this year I’ve been impressed,’ said Redknapp. ‘They’ve got pace, they play with wingers and they’re a dangerous side.

‘It’s going to be a scrap. There’s nothing in it down at the bottom. There are seven or eight teams going to be involved.’
