Liverpool fans will have had their hearts in their mouths on Thursday evening as Daniel Sturridge took to Twitter to ask for a Spanish tutor.

The 24-year-old starred for Brendan Rodgers after joining from Chelsea last season, but could his latest tweet suggest that Sturridge is eyeing up a move to Spain in the future?

Sturridge tweeted: 'Who knows of a Spanish Tutor or wants to teach me? I know a little but not enough... Help a brother out!!!'

On the move? Daniel Sturridge took to Twitter to ask for a tutor in Spanish

The former Blues forward joined the Reds in a £12million deal last January and has enjoyed a fruitful stay so far, scoring 36 goals in 49 appearances.

Liverpool boss Rodgers will be keen to keep hold of Sturridge for as long as possible, particularly after the loss of star striker Luis Suarez to Barcelona this summer.
