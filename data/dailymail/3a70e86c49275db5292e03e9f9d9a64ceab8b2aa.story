A suburban Minneapolis high school cheerleader is accused of prostituting a younger student by creating an online ad and taking her to see potential customers, pocketing $60 in one case.

Montia Marie Parker, 18, of Maple Grove, faces felony charges of sex trafficking and promoting prostitution. She is scheduled to appear in court June 12.

Parker was a senior at Hopkins High School when she allegedly set up a Backpage.com ad for a cognitively delayed16-year-old, driving her to an apartment to have oral sex with a man, and taking the $60 the girl made.

The 16-year-old received none of the money.

Authorities allege Parker and the girl drove to another home the next day, but left after the man refused oral sex.

The girl's mother called police after reading text messages between her daughter and Parker on the girl's cellphone, the Star Tribune reported.

The 16-year-old had mentioned to others that she was trying to make some money.

Parker sent the girl a Facebook message and text message about how she could make money having sex, requesting that the girl send her photos of herself, the charges allege.

Parker posted the photos on Backpage.com, listing her phone number as the contact, the charges said.

Both girls attended Hopkins High School in Maple Grove

On March 5, the girls left school and went to an apartment building. When the younger girl returned to the car, she gave Parker the $60 and Parker deposited it into her own bank account, according to the complaint.

The next day, Parker pretended to be the girl's mother and called the school to get her excused, the charges said. The girls left school and went to a home where the girl was directed to have sex with a man. She refused.

'You'll be fine - I didn't drive up here for nothing, and eventually you will need to have sex,' Parker told the girl, according to the complaint.

The girl told the man she wouldn't have intercourse with him but would give him oral sex.

The man refused and Parker drove the girl back to Hopkins High School, according to the complaint.

The girl's mother checked her daughter's cellphone after noticing changes in her daughter's behavior and hearing that she had an unexcused absence from school.

Minneapolis Lt. Kim Lund said authorities have noticed more cases within the last five years involving teen girls using Backpage.com

Minneapolis Lt. Kim Lund, president of the Minnesota Juvenile Officers' Association, said authorities have noticed more cases within the last five years involving teen girls using Backpage.com.

However, Lund said, it's unusual to have a case involving a teen prostituting a fellow teen; most human trafficking cases involve adult men or women contacting teens.

Parker admitted to police that she had created the ad and told them she received 'a lot of calls' related to it, according to the complaint. She's free on $50,000 bond.

Hopkins High School's last day of classes is Thursday, but school officials said they acted immediately after learning of the charges. The school has about 1,800 students.

'In responding to this incident, we followed our discipline and safety policy, which includes permanently removing a student from campus,' the district said in a statement.
