Hollyoaks has overtaken EastEnders as Britain’s most violent soap opera with threatening scenes occurring on average 11.5 times per hour, according to a study by media regulator Ofcom.

The Channel 4 programme, aimed at teens and young adults, has seen the number of violent scenes increase considerably in recent years and last year it was censured by Ofcom.

Hollyoaks has risen from 2.1 violent scenes per hour in 2001/2 to 11.5 scenes per hour last year. At the same time EastEnders has seen a dramatic fall from 6.1 to 2.1 over the same period.

ITV's Coronation Street has remained largely steady at 3, while Emmerdale has seen an increase during those years from 2.5 to 4.

The new research comes just days after one broadcaster was given a substantial fine by the regulator for screening graphic depictions of ‘extreme violence’ including torture, a child murder and dismemberment of a corpse before the watershed.

Investigation Discovery was given a £100,000 penalty for screening eight episodes of its documentary series Deadly Women during daytime schedules.

For the new Ofcom study, researchers looked at 282 episodes of the four soaps and found that more than half of all the violent scenes they recorded were in Hollyoaks.

The Channel 4 show also accounted for all of what were classed as ‘strong violence’, much of them coming from two storylines.

Almost three-quarters of the scenes classed as violent were made up of threats and intimidation or incidents such as pushing, prodding and tripping.

Fists were used in only five per cents of the incidents - slightly fewer than the slaps which made up six per cent- and the shooting of firearms made up less than one per cent.

In its report Ofcom said: ‘The conclusion must be that the amount of violence logged in a soap appears to be largely determined by the storylines running at a particular time.

‘In Hollyoaks all the violent scenes with a high severity rating were either central or pivotal to the storyline in which they appeared. Violence occurred for a reason, and was used to drive the narrative along.

‘In the overwhelming number of cases it was considered to add dramatic value to the plot or the characterisations.’

The report pointed out that violence in the soaps - which it said in most cases was ‘quite mild’ - did not trivialise, glamorise or condone it.

And it said that for the most part viewers would have been aware they could expect the violent scenes and would not have been surprised by it.

Last year Ofcom ruled that Hollyoaks breached its programme code by screening a scene before the watershed in which character Simon Walker was pushed under a train. However there have not been any major viewer complaints about violence in the series since then.

A Channel 4 spokesman said: ‘We are committed to ensuring that all Hollyoaks storylines are appropriate for a pre-watershed audience.

‘The portrayal of violence is appropriately limited and is shown within the context of long-running storylines - and programmes that include scenes which some people may find upsetting are clearly flagged to viewers at the beginning of the broadcast.

‘Hollyoaks has a track record in tackling issues affecting its audience and has worked alongside government and leading charities on subjects such as domestic abuse and bullying.’

The sharp rise in the number of violent scenes in Hollyoaks over the last few years has included a number of major storylines.

Ofcom statistics show the number of threatening scenes in the Channel 4 soap has risen from 2.1 per hour in 2001/2 to 11.5 per hour last year.

Some of the more recent Hollyoaks storylines have seen characters embroiled in violence, crime and tragedy.

Unsuspecting Myra McQueen – played by Nicole Barber-Lane - was attacked and later shot by Dr Paul Browning, towards the end of last year.

More recently, the body of arch villain Fraser Black was found slumped in a car at a petrol station after he was shot dead.

The drama focused on a ‘whodunnit-style’ killing which later revealed Freddie Roscoe to be his killer.

However, some of the biggest drama of the show came last year when - to celebrate the soap turning 18 years old - five main characters were killed off in one week.

Ash Kane and Doug Carter were killed in an explosion, while Claire Devine was ran over by Dr Browning after Mercedes McQueen pushed her in front of his car. Callum Kane and newcomer Jade Hedy were also killed off in Hollyoaks Later.

Last year, the Channel 4 show was wrapped by Ofcom for breaching broadcasting rules in an episode, screened at 6.30pm, in which a main character was killed by a speeding train.

The scene, aired in March, marked the culmination of a long-running revenge storyline involving a former undercover policeman, Walker, and ex-drug dealer Brendan.

Hollyoaks was wrapped by Ofcom after a scene, aired before the watershed in March last year, followed the death of a character Walker (above) who was killed by a speeding train

It 
ended with Walker screaming as he fell backwards on to the railway track
 and into the path of a train before the camera cut away to show the 
train passing at high speed.

There were no images of Walker being hit by the train but the fight in the build-up included several blows to the face and stomach, Brendan’s head being pushed through railings, Walker with bloody lips and blood running from his nose, while viewers heard the groans as they inflicted blows.

Channel 4 said that the storyline had run for around a year and that viewers were notified that a dramatic episode would be broadcast.

Tina McIntyre - played by Michelle Keegan - was killed off in Coronation Street earlier this year

However,
 Ofcom said the pre-programme information was too vague and would 'not 
have prepared the significant number of younger viewers in the audience,
 or their parents, adequately for the violent, intense and shocking 
scenes which followed.'

Other dramatic storylines in popular British soaps so far this year include the death of Tina McIntyre – played by Michelle Keegan – in Coronation Street.

The barmaid could be seen lying motionless on the cobbles after plunging from the balcony of the builder’s yard flat following a dramatic showdown in an episode aired towards the end of May.

And in EastEnders fans were glued to their screens in April when Lucy Beale in a ‘whodunnit-style’ killing.
