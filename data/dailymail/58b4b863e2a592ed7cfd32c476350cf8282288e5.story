Seven-time Wimbledon champion Roger Federer faces Milos Raonic in the second of Friday's men's Wimbledon semi-finals on Centre Court.    

Federer defeated his compatriot and Australian open champion Stanislas Wawrinka in the previous round while Raonic overcame Rafael Nadal's conqueror Nick Kyrgios.

If Raonic can defeat Federer, the 23-year-old will become the first Canadian to reach a Grand Slam final.

Novak Djokovic defeated Grigor Dimitrov 6-4, 3-6, 7-6, 7-6

That's all from Sportsmail's live Wimbledon coverage of the men's semi-finals as Roger Federer and Novak Djokovic set up a mouth-watering final on Sunday.

Djokovic made reasonably hard work of Andy Murray's quarter-final conqueror Grigor Dimitrov, while Federer sailed to a straight sets victory against Milos Raonic.

Thanks for following!

That was all too easy for Federer as he gets through straight sets in just under two hours to set up a final against No 1 seed Novak Djokovic.

Federer breaks after a poor game from Raonic and he's serving for a place in the Wimbledon final. 

Crucial game coming up now as it's where Raonic has lost his serve on both occasions. 

He needs to keep his serve to have any chance of staying in this set. 

Federer hits two brilliant forehand smashed to take his service game in style. Raonic actually managed to return a forehand smash, only to tee Federer up for another one.  

Raonic keeps his serve to go ahead in the third set. The big Canadian hit a wonderful forehand down the line to win the game, but you just get the feeling he's a beaten man out on Centre Court. 

Federer takes his second set of the afternoon to take a commanding lead out on Centre Court.

Raonic is a talent but he just can't match Federer today as the Canadian fails to return a backhand. 

The 32-year-old takes a huge step to winning the second set by breaking Raonic midway through.

Raonic played a shot to forget as he over-hit an overhead smash to hand Federer three break points which proved impossible to come back from.

Federer seems almost apologetic as he hits a perfect half-volley just up and over the net to win the game.

The Swiss star holds up a hand to apologise as he clearly thought he got lucky with that one. 

We stay with serve as Federer takes his third game of the set without dropping a point. 

Raonic has been struggling to return anything the Swiss veteran is throwing at him, hitting the net on three occasions during that game. 

Raonic eventually goes in front after a backhand volley at the net. He had raced into an early 40-15 lead but was pegged back as the pair shared several deuce points.   

The Canadian figure when he goes up to the net but he's not doing it often enough. Staying at the baseline will only allow Federer more time to pick his spots. 

The first set goes to Federer and it was all too easy for the seven-time Wimbledon champion.

Raonic can hurt the Swiss star with his serve but there' only one winner when the pair enter a rally. 

Raonic hits a 132mph SECOND serve to take the game away from Federer.

There's very little rhythm to this game at the moment as Raonic either aces, faults or loses the point. 

Raonic battles well through a tight game, but Federer goes up a gear to serves out the game with an ace. 

The game saw a first lose shot from Federer - 26 minutes into the match.  

The Canadian keeps his serve once again and seems to have settled into the game now.

Federer, of course, is a class act but Raonic can give him a game if he stays calm out on Centre Court.

Federer is making life hard for Raonic by returning absolutely everything. 

Raonic picks up another game as he smashes a serve across Federer and onto the line. 

Federer sweeps a delightful backhand in front of Raonic to claim another game.  

The Canadian seems to be showing Federer a little too much respect out on Centre Court. 

Raonic takes his first game of the match as Federer struggles to get near his serves. 

Federer keeps his serve to go two games up in the first set. Both games have been close so far, but Federer doesn't look to have worked up a sweat just yet.

Well that was easy... Raonic has a huge serve but it's no use if he can't match Federer during the rallies. 

The Swiss star is a break up after one game as he fires a forehand passed the baseline.  

The players are knocking the balls back and forth as they warm-up for the second men's semi-final of the day. 

Federer is looking for his eighth Wimbledon title. Can Raonic stop him? 

Riath Al-Samarrai: Pretty empty out here on Centre Court for Raonic-Federer. Brute force versus pure elegance. Looking forward to this clash of styles.
