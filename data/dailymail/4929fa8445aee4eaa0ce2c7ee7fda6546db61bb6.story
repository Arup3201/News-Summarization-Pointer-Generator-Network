The man accused of pushed a Bronx man into the path of a subway train says he can't remember grisly killing.

Kevin Darden was arrested three days after he was allegedly caught on CCTV shoving Wai Kwen Kwok in front of a train in Highbridge, Bronx, New York City.

Footage showed no fight between Mr Kwok and his assailant leading to the push, and police were unable to ascertain a motive. 

Darden allegedly fled the scene before authorities could arrive.

'I don't remember': Kevin Darden, left, 34, has been charged in connection with the death of Wai Kuen Kwok, 61, who was pushed in front of a subway train while waiting with his wife at East 167th Street Station

Identified: Darden was arrested three days after he was allegedly caught on CCTV shoving Wai Kwen Kwok in front of a oncoming southbound D train on November 16

Today Darden, 34, speaking from Rikers Island jail, told ABC's Channel 7 he would 'never do anything like that.'

'I don’t remember anything about [last] Sunday, I didn’t do anything,' he insisted.

It was 8.45am on Sunday November 16 and Mr Kwok, 61, was with his wife, Yow Ho Lee, 59, at East 167th Street Station waiting for a train to Chinatown to celebrate her birthday.

It was then, apparently without warning or motive, that a man shoved the Chinese immigrant into the path of the oncoming southbound D train. 

Mr Kwok's visibly shaken widow can reportedly be seen in surveillance footage as she's taken to an ambulance and sent to a local hospital to be treated for shock.

Darden was also said to have been caught on camera. He was seen not long after the deadly attack boarding a BX35 bus, then exiting a few moments later to go into a bodega. 

He left the store smoking a cigarette.

Kwok was reportedly with his wife waiting on the train at 8:45 a.m. Sunday when he was shoved onto the tracks at the station on 167th Street and Grand Concourse

Darden said he had been left confused by the situation. 'I don’t know what to do or say; I’ve never been in this type of situation before,' he said.

Darden has more than 30 prior arrests on his record including charges for robbery, assault, drugs and allegedly trying to set fire to his brother's home.

According to police, on November 6 before Mr Kwok's killing, in a separate incident, Darden 'pushed a 51 year old male to the ground causing an injury to the victims hand and back.

'The victim was transported to NYU Medical Center where he was treated and released.'

He was last arrested on Sunday, November 9, after allegedly pickpocketing someone in Manhattan.

Psychiatrists are closely monitoring Darden at Rikers, the New York Post reports, and he is due back in court on Monday.
