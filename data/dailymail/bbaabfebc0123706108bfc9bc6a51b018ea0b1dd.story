He is less than a week off his first birthday but already Prince George is 'charging around and opening doors'.

According to his besotted father, Prince William, the little prince has found his feet and causing mayhem as he races around the family's apartment at Kensington Palace.

William was speaking on a visit to Coventry's War Memorial Park today to launch the Centenary Fields Project, which aims to protect green spaces around the country by building war memorials.

Sisters Mavis and Mary Jarvis, aged 74 and 72 respectively, who travelled from Leicester to see William, immediately quizzed him about being a father.

Mavis said: 'We asked him straight away about the baby and he said it's his birthday next week. He said George is charging around and opens doors. He said he's lovely.'

William also told Gill Naylor, headteacher of Earlsdon Primary School: 'I think George will be running faster than me very soon.'

George, was born in the private Lindo Wing of St Mary’s Hospital, Paddington, a year ago on Tuesday. The Duke and Duchess of Cambridge have cleared their diaries and are planning a private party for their son.

William was inundated with gifts for his son including a plaque spelling his name in Scrabble letters.

He was also given a turquoise and black 'loom band' - the latest craze among schoolchildren. As he put it on, William revealed he already had a stash of some 200 he had been given by well-wishers at home.

In a pre-released message, the second in line to the throne stressed the importance of open space in a community.

'As someone who has always enjoyed sport, and now as a new father, I appreciate the importance of allowing our children the freedom to experience outdoor space,' he said.

Sombre: The prince's visit also had a serious side - marking 100 years since World War One

And in a speech at the end of his visit, he added: 'World War One continues to inspire us - one hundred years on - to undertake acts of remembrance for men and women otherwise long forgotten.

'The Centenary Fields project… aims to save in perpetuity scores of memorial places around the country.

'I am delighted that Fields In Trust have identified these Centenary Fields as a vital part of our national heritage and well-being, that we cannot take for granted.'
