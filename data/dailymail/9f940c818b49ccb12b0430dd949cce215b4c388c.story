It will be the biggest crowd ever for a rugby match in the States as the 15-man game looks to crack the American market.

New Zealand have named a star-studded squad for their tour with captain Richie McCaw, fly half Danny Carter, centre Sonny Bill Williams and No 8 Kieran Read all travelling.

They are just some of the stars who could be seen walking around Chicago on Tuesday.
