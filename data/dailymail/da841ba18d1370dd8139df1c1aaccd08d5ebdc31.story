Through war and peace, in sickness and in health, they have been man and wife for 75 years.

So any little tip that Joseph Littlewood, 98, and wife Sally, 99, might care to impart about the secret of a long and happy partnership must surely be worth its weight in gold, pearls, rubies, silver and diamonds.

And the advice is? ‘Argue,’ said Mrs Littlewood. ‘Argue lots but always remember to get over it.’

It may go against convention, but it seems to have worked for this 
couple. They have just celebrated 75 years of marriage – and 81 years as
 a couple – and are still arguing as they approach their 100th 
birthdays.

Believed to be Britain’s longest-married couple, they have long since 
stopped counting the number of the times they kissed and made up after a
 tiff.

‘People always have arguments,’ says the delightfully no-nonsense Mrs 
Littlewood. ‘In 75 years we’re going to have had a lot – but the key is 
to move on. It’s never worth stewing over.’

The former mill worker and her husband also shared their thoughts on how
 many  of the younger generation appear to rush into commitment.

Joseph and Sally Littlewood recently celebrated their 75th wedding anniversary. They met at a dance hall in 1933 but were then separated for six years when Joseph was in Cairo during World War II

‘Kids these days move in together not really knowing what they want from
 each other,’ Mrs Littlewood said. ‘If you’re going to move in with 
someone, or marry them, you have to know you love them. Everyone is 
getting divorced these days. They have quick marriages and I just think 
people do not have what they want.’

Mr Littlewood added: ‘When we were young, people just stuck together – 
but back then we had courtship, and that has gone by  the wayside.

‘A quick wedding wasn’t done in those days and a long engagement gave 
you time to get to know each other and know if the other person was the 
one you wanted.’

The couple met 81 years ago and have enjoyed many happy moments. Pictured, left, on holiday in 1985 and, right, before Joseph left for war in 1939

George V was on the throne when Joseph and Sally met in 1933 and Adolf 
Hitler was rising to power in Germany. King Kong wowed cinema audiences 
with the latest advances in special effects, and – crucially for these 
sweethearts – the Mars bar was new to the UK.

It might have helped this particular courtship that Joseph, then a 
16-year-old financial worker, clearly knew the best way to a girl’s 
heart.

He asked her for a dance at the local hop, took her on a romantic walk –
 and bought her a Mars bar. It turned out to be the shrewdest investment
 he ever made. ‘He just charmed me off my feet,’ Mrs Littlewood 
recalled. ‘He was from a posh family and we were really poor. After that
 we fell in love.’

The couple courted for six years before marrying in 1939, just weeks 
before the outbreak of the Second World War. Mr Littlewood fought in the
 North African desert campaign.

For six years they did not see each other but exchanged regular love 
letters. Mrs Littlewood looked forward to them dropping on the mat but 
spent every day dreading an official letter saying something had 
happened to her sweetheart.

By the time Joseph came home in 1945 he had lost all his blond hair and 
his wife barely recognised him when she met him at the station.

‘I grabbed him hard and it was lovely,’ she said yesterday. ‘We haven’t been separated since. We still love each other.’

The couple now live in sheltered accommodation near where they met in 
Oldham, where they host bingo nights and go to fitness classes. They 
have two children, two step-grandchildren and a 
step-great-granddaughter.

Daughter Wyn, 68, said: ‘They try really hard, but no relationship is 
perfect. My mum gets fed up when my dad falls asleep and she ends up 
throwing a shoe at him. My dad gets annoyed when my mum is impatient. 
These days there are benefits for single mums but back then there 
weren’t, so you had no choice but to try. My parents hit the jackpot 
though.’
