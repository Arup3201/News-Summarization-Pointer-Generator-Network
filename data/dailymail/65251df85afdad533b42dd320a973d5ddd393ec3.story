They are the diamond-encrusted Birmingham-made shoes for the decidedly well-heeled - and they're yours for a cool £200,000.

The Princess Constellation stilettos sparkle with 1,290 precious gems were inspired by the Paul Simon hit, Diamonds On The Soles Of Her Shoes.

The design has taken more than two years to develop and each pair takes three weeks to create.

Dazzling: A pair of stilettos encrusted with nearly 1,300 diamonds have gone on sale for an eye-watering £200,000. The sparkling shoes, dubbed the Diamond Princess Constellation stilettos, are available in either solid platinum or luxurious 18ct gold

The stilettos are the work of British designer Christopher Michael Shellis, from Birmingham, who has created a host of similarly opulent creations.

The heel and sole are easily replaceable by the owner so that they last for ever, and Christopher is backing up his claim with a 1,000-year guarantee.

Christopher, whose label is called House of Borgezie, has worked in the heart of the Jewellery Quarter for more than 20 years.

He creates and designs extravagant shoes, working with temperatures of more than 1,000C as he uses a secret heating technique.

Work of art: The design has taken over two years to develop and each pair takes about three weeks to create. The stilettos are the work of British designer, Christopher Michael Shellis from Birmingham

Lifetime investment: The heel and sole are easily replaceable by the owner so that they last forever and Christopher is backing up his claim with a 1,000-year guarantee

Princess shoes: 'They're truly regal and have been created to be a world treasure - guaranteed to still be here in a thousand years' time,' says the designer of his latest creation

House of Borgeize hit the headlines when it unveiled the world's first everlasting stilettos and last year the 48-year-old, from Aston, launched the world's most expensive shoe - the £140,000 Eternal Borgeize.

Chris has raised the bar considerably with his latest design, which is available in solid platinum or 18-carat gold.

He said: 'After 25 years, the Princess Constellation are probably my finest work. They are the crown jewels of stilettos. They're a bit like the 1960s E Type Jag - it doesn't matter what you do, you're not going to improve on them.

Extravagant: House of Borgezie customers include buyers from Russia, Dubai and the United States. Celebrities are also among Chris' clientele, too

Cinderella would be proud: 'These are the ultimate in feminine adornment, they're the crown jewels of stilettos,' says the designer from Birmingham

'Occasionally in a designer or artist's life there may come a moment in time when you stand back and realise you may just have created your finest work so far. I think this is truly that moment.

'Like any royal crown, the Princess Constellation will still be here in a thousand years' time.'

It may take a lot of sole-searching before purchasing a pair, but Chris stressed his stilettos for the super-rich don't just look good.

'They're a good investment,' he added.

'These are the ultimate in feminine adornment, they’re the crown jewels of stilettos.

'They’re truly regal and have been created to be a world treasure - guaranteed to still be here in a thousand years time.

Proud moment: Chris says he believes the Princess Constellation stilettos are his finest work so far

Glittering: The sparkling shoes, dubbed the Diamond Princess Constellation stilettos, are available in either solid platinum or luxurious 18ct gold and come adorned with blue butterfly designs

'They’ll make any woman feel like a princess.'

House of Borgezie customers include buyers from Russia, Dubai and the United States. Celebrities are also among Chris' clientele. 'Every shoe is a bit like making a violin. They are jewellery for the feet,' he insisted.

Now Chris is set to fulfil an ambition to market stilettos for 'the average woman'. The bargain-busting shoes will be unveiled next month - for less than £1,000!
