If you ever feel like you’re surrounded by people who are smarter, sexier and more well-read than you are, don’t worry.

According to a new study, most of them are just putting it on - and it’s probably because they are trying to impress you.

Poll results show eight in ten of us lie to seem cleverer and more attractive than we really are in social situations.

Over half of those surveyed admit to changing their appearance to try and come across as clever - including wearing glasses even if they are not needed (posed by model)

Two thirds of respondents even admitted to pretending they have read worthy books such as Tolstoy’s War and Peace.

Researchers say that we feign intelligence in a bid to be more sexually attractive to potential partners.

A sixth of those surveyed admitted to exaggerating their academic achievements or fluency in foreign languages.

A further 11 per cent inflated their job status and role, while a similar proportion owned up to bragging about their knowledge of wine.

Over half - 53 per cent - of those surveyed admit to changing their appearance to try and come across as clever.

Tactics include wearing sober business suits or other such smart outfits and glasses even if they are not needed.

One in 20 men has tried growing a moustache or beard and three per cent of women have changed their hair colour from blonde to brunette.

Three quarters of Brits say they find intelligence attractive while 70 per cent would choose brains over beauty in their partner.

Behavioural psychologist Jo Hemmings said: ‘The study shows that being intelligent has never been more sexy and that the vast majority of us are working hard to appear smarter than we actually are.

One in eight has turned to a thesaurus to make their writing sound more impressive. A show-off five per cent recite poetry while three per cent hide low brow books in their homes

‘From expertise in literature and wine
 to a penchant for correct grammar and art-house or foreign language 
films, wannabe geeks are exaggerating their worldly qualities in order 
to appear more nerdy.’

Other
 sneaky tricks to appear intelligent and worldly include correcting 
other people’s grammar and dropping famous quotations into conversation.

One in eight has turned to a thesaurus to make their writing sound more impressive.

And eight per cent admit to dismissing popular films as ‘rubbish’ - while secretly enjoying them.

To
 fake a detailed grasp of current affairs, six per cent re-tweet news 
and features from sources that seem clever while five per cent research 
topics before dinner parties.

A show-off five per cent recite poetry while three per cent hide low brow books in their homes.

And two per cent are wannabe wine buffs who put on an excessive show of swirling and gargling their drink to appear sophisticated.

Over half of us - 52 per cent - display books at home that we have never read, the survey of 2,000 people found.

The most popular book to brag about is George Orwell’s 1984, followed by Leo Tolstoy’s War and Peace and Charles Dickens’ Great Expectations.

Women are more likely than men to bluff that they are well-read when they have often only seen literary classics dramatised in films or on TV.

But men are more likely to fib when bragging of their academic achievements and jobs.

They are also twice as likely as women to cite famous quotations to appear wise and worldly.

The survey was commissioned to mark the launch of American geek sitcom The Big Bang Theory season 6 on DVD this week.
