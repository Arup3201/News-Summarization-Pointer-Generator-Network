Allies of George Osborne last night denied he has given up hope of succeeding David Cameron – just as the Chancellor launched a new charm offensive.

Just ten days before he is due to unveil a multi-billion-pound giveaway budget which could decide the result of the Election, Mr Osborne is working hard to boost his image.

He took part in a magazine interview with the Financial Times which included ‘man of the people’ images of him building a dry stone wall.

Dreams: Allies of George Osborne last night denied he has given up hope of succeeding David Cameron

The newspaper suggested Mr Osborne’s behaviour was at odds with a recent claim that he had abandoned hope of becoming Tory leader.

A Tory MP close to the Chancellor said last night: ‘George will always be loyal to Cameron, but he is not the type to rule anything out.’

Mr Osborne said he had decided against challenging Mr Cameron for the Tory leadership in 2005 after watching Shakespeare’s Henry IV. 

The two-part drama opens with Henry racked with guilt after stealing the crown from his predecessor Richard II, who was murdered. 

Claim: Mr Osborne said he was urged to run against Mr Cameron by Michael Howard, whose resignation as Tory leader triggered the contest

Apparently, ‘the drama and intrigue on the stage and people being assassinated’ convinced him it was an ‘omen’.

Mr Osborne said he was urged to run against Mr Cameron by Michael Howard, whose resignation as Tory leader triggered the contest. Mr Osborne said he discussed it with wife Frances, his parents and friends including William Hague.

But he denied he and Mr Cameron had a Blair-Brown style deal whereby one allegedly promised to hand over power to the other after a few years in power.

‘There was never any deal, that’s not the nature of our relationship,’ he told the Financial Times.
