They may look like exotic plants, but in fact these incredible pictures are close-ups of tiny fragments of coral.

Marine Biology student Daniel Stoupin, 26, was given access to studios owned by aquarists and coral collectors to take the photographs.

The incredible layered images of tiny pieces of coral show a fascinating range of colours and symmetrical shapes.

Marine Biology student Daniel Stoupin, 26, was given access to studios owned by aquarists and coral collectors to take the photographs. The incredible layered images of tiny pieces of coral show a fascinating range of colours and symmetrical shapes

Each piece is from the Great Barrier Reef or other reefs around Australia.

Mr Stoupin, from Brisbane, Australia, opted to use studios rather than a sea dive to capture the detailed colours and structure of the complex corals.

He said: 'While I enjoy taking pictures when I dive, I am not an underwater photographer yet.

Mr Stoupin, from Brisbane, Australia, opted to use studios rather than a sea dive to capture the detailed colours and structure of the complex corals like this piece of yellow coral

'I wanted to try advanced photography and illumination techniques on such fascinating and mysterious animals as corals - something that is nearly impossible to perform on a dive.

'That is why I became interested in getting access to corals collected from the Great Barrier Reef.

'In Australia this kind of business is popular - private companies organise dives, collect corals from the reef and sell fragments to aquarists in Australia and abroad.

Scolymia coral almost looks like a shot from inside the human body

This piece of Blastomussa coral looks like a strange flower. The fragment came from collections of coral samples, which are popular as private companies organise dives, collect corals from the reef and sell fragments to aquarists in Australia and abroad

'It is legal and monitored by environmental researchers and does not threaten reefs.'

Mr Stoupin spent four months photographing corals and due to the complexity of the techniques he used, would spend up to 10 hours to produce one or two images.

Some of the pieces were no bigger than 2cm and high magnification was needed.

Some of the pieces were no bigger than 2cm and high magnification was needed, such as to capture this Blastomussa coral with its intriguing microscopic spines

However, to capture the rainbow of colours, a special torch was used to light up the corals.

According to Mr Stoupin, an advanced full-spectrum light, rather than normal white light from a torch, allows the different colours to be made visible.

He said: 'Corals, even the biggest ones, have details, which would escape our attention.

The marine biology student used an advanced full-spectrum light, rather than normal white light from a torch, to photograph the different colours in this sample of Blue-Crlimrph coral in all its glory

He originally planned on photographing coral underwater, but knew he would need precise motion and a camera positioned on something solid, which is next to impossible underwater

'I thought that corals would be especially fascinating but the technique requires precise motion and the camera has to be positioned on something solid, which is next to impossible underwater.

'However, capturing the colours was my second reason to go for studio photography instead of diving.

'Many representatives of marine life possess fluorescent pigments, which are responsible for their colour, but they don't reflect light similarly to substances that are familiar to us.

Mr Stoupin said many representatives of marine life possess fluorescent pigments, which are responsible for their colour, but they don't reflect light similarly to substances that are familiar to us. This fragment of reverse prism favia coral almost appears to glow

Under a normal white torch light most corals like this spiky coral would look brown and colourless but the moment you shine full-spectrum light on them, they light up with an entire rainbow of colours, according to Mr Stoupin

'For example, grass is green because it reflects green light whereas a fluorescent pigment is capable of transforming blue light from the water into green.

'Thus a coral can be green even when there's no green light to reflect,' he explained.

Mr Stoupin said: 'Under a normal white torch light most corals would look brown and colourless but the moment you shine full-spectrum light on them, they light up with an entire rainbow of colours.'
