Fans have accused the bowler of trivialising the defeat

English cricketer Graeme Swann has sparked outrage after comparing the Ashes defeat to being 'a***-raped'.

The spin bowler made the controversial remarks during a conversation with his brother Alec on Facebook just hours after crashing to the embarrassing defeat against the Aussies.

Yesterday Alec updated his profile - which is publicly accessible to anyone - saying how he had enjoyed a night out watching Shed Seven at the Roadmender gig venue, in Northampton.

Two hours later Swann, 34, responded on the thread and said: 'Rather have been there than being a*** raped in Perth!'

Rape charities have criticised the 
Nottinghamshire player for his 'appalling' actions and urged him to 
apologise for the comments. 

Yvonne
 Traynor, chief executive of the Rape Crisis charity, said: 'We are 
appalled that Graeme Swann equates a cricket match with the 
devastatingly serious crime of rape.

'It
 is the duty of a people in the public eye to make sure that their own 
distorted views are kept to themselves and not shared with the general 
public.

'These comments lack compassion and intelligence and he should apologise to anyone who has suffered from this heinous crime.'

Following the comment - which has 
attracted seven 'likes' - one pal replies saying 'Bad luck In Oz Swann 
Dog.......pool and beer sounds in order?'

To which Swann replied: 'Twelve pints and a game of darts more like.'

Other
 cricket fans have accused the bowler of trivialising the defeat and 
lacking professionalism following England’s dismal test series.

Plasterer
 Don Smith, 60, who is currently in Australia to watch the Ashes tour, 
said: 'We’ve spent our hard earned money flying out here and not only 
have they rolled over and let the Aussie’s trounce them, some players 
are joking about it.

Swann has so far put in a lacklustre performance so far coming in for punishment from the Aussies who attacked him to the tune of 80 runs for each of his seven wickets

Australia regained the Ashes after four years by subjecting England to a humiliating 150 run defeat

'And not only that, the choice of words is disgusting. There is nothing funny about rape and to use those words in such a flippant manner is disgraceful.

'Then to say he is going to have 12 pints just makes it sound if they are enjoying a holiday out here.'

Fan Bob Peters, 56, from Walsall, West Midlands, added: 'It just isn’t funny, I was horrified when I saw those comments.'

Yesterday Australia regained the Ashes after four years by subjecting England to a humiliating 150 run defeat.

It puts Australia 3-0 up in the series with two tests still to play in Melbourne and Sydney.

On Tuesday evening cricket legend Bob Willis called for Swann to be axed from the England squad.
