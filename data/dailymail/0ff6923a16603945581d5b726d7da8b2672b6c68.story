Former Detroit Lions player Titus Young was arrested twice in just 15 hours.

Young, who played wide receiver in the NFL, was pulled over shortly after midnight on Sunday by police after he made an illegal left turn in Moreno Valley, southern California.

Moreno Valley Police Department then arrested him on suspicion of driving under the influence and issued Young with a citation before he was released.

Two mug shots were taken by Riverside County Sheriff's office after Titus Young was arrested on suspicion of driving under the influence and burglary, when he was accused of trying to steal his impounded car

At about 2.20pm the same day, Young was arrested after a man was seen climbing over a fence at a local tow yard.

He was then arrested on suspicion of burglary accused of trying to steal his own car.Â 

Young allegedly told police that he was looking for his impounded black Mustang.

The 23-year-old was selected by the Detroit Lions in the second round of the 2011 NFL Draft after playing college football at Boise State University.

The NFL team released him in February this year after a number of disciplinary issues.

He was sent home by coaches after punching Louis Delmas in May last year.

Titus Young scored 25 touchdowns for Boise State University but also was suspended for punching a teammate

Six months later he was sent home again after coaching staff claimed he lined up in the wrong position, which Young later denied.

He was then claimed off waivers by the St Louis Rams but released just 10 days later when the team said they wanted to 'go in a different direction.'

Young made 25 touchdowns during his collegiate career but was also in trouble while playing for Boise State.

He was suspended for fighting with a teammate during the sophomore season.
