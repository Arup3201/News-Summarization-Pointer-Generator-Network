Immigrants who were found hiding in a food lorry entering Britain. Fresh food supplies to the UK are being threatened by stowaways

Fresh food supplies to the UK are coming under threat because illegal immigrants are hiding in the back of lorries, it emerged last night.

Entire truck-loads of imported fruit and vegetables are being destroyed if a migrant is found inside a transportation vehicle, MPs heard – and this could lead to a supplies shortage.

Home Secretary Theresa May has agreed to an urgent meeting with the ‘increasingly worried’ food industry to try to find ways of better protecting imported food from stowaways.

It is understood that, over the Christmas period, large quantities of vegetables destined for supermarkets and other retailers had to be ‘condemned’ for this reason.

Many migrants clamber aboard lorries as they are being loaded –sometimes as far away as Spain – while others sneak aboard later in a journey. 

But once an illegal immigrant is detected by the authorities, either at the port of Calais or in the UK, the cargo is deemed ‘contaminated’, no longer considered fit for human consumption and destroyed.

If this problem persists, it could lead to a shortage of supplies or a rise in food prices to cover the cost of ruined consignments.

Ex-agriculture minister Sir James Paice, who has long-established contacts in the food industry, said: ‘There’s ample evidence now that many illegal immigrants are getting into lorries as far afield as Spain, particularly lorries bringing fresh food into this country, which means the whole load is condemned.

‘Our retail sector is now increasingly worried about fresh food supplies.’

Speaking in the Commons, Mrs May confirmed officials were ‘aware’ of the problem. She added: ‘We are looking to introduce improved ability to identify people who are within lorries when they pass through our controls in Calais.

‘But obviously the problem is often people are getting into the lorries further afield, which even if you find them at Calais the load is still considered to have been damaged and contaminated.’

The revelations came amid increased pressure on ministers to get a grip on the immigration chaos at Calais.

Yesterday a member of the Home Affairs Select Committee, which has recently been on a fact-finding trip to the port, revealed the farce of migrants being caught by UK border guards – only to be immediately set free again by the French authorities.

Britain can stop migrants from travelling to the UK from Calais but it is up to the French to decide whether to deport them.

Tory MP Tim Loughton then questioned whether the ‘real problem’ was that ‘when potential migrants are apprehended, the French police take them two miles outside town and release them without even taking their fingerprints, so they can come and do it all over again’.

Once lorries have reached the country, the UK Border Force uses an array of search techniques including sniffer dogs, carbon dioxide detectors, heartbeat monitors, scanners and visual searches to find stowaways.

Last month it emerged that a record 3,000 immigrants a month were caught trying to sneak into the UK illegally, including 420 who were refused entry more than once.
