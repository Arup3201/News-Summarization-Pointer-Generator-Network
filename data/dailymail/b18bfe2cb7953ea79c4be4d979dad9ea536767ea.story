The thieves struck in broad daylight, seemingly undaunted by the fact that they were surrounded by dozens of members of the public.

Yesterday, the Metropolitan Police announced that between 8am and 3pm last Thursday — peak visiting hours — a rare species of water lily, the nymphaea thermarum, had been stolen from the Princess of Wales Conservatory at London’s Kew Gardens.

They believe the specimen of the smallest water lily in the world, with flowers smaller than a pound coin, was wrenched or dug up from its shallow pond before being smuggled out.

The plant — discovered in south-west Rwanda not quite three decades ago by German botanist Professor Eberhard Fischer — is now extinct in the wild.

There are only a few cultivated samples at Kew and in Germany. Kew’s specimen has been described as of ‘enormous scientific importance’.

‘It’s difficult to put a value on it,’ says Richard Barley, Kew’s director of horticulture. ‘They’re incredibly hard to cultivate and we have only a small number. It has been known in just one location in the wild.’

But if he is devastated, he isn’t surprised. ‘There are people who act this way. The trade in stolen plants is a global issue.’

Of course, plant cuttings have been taken surreptitiously by keen gardeners for centuries.

Records from the Old Bailey in the 18th century refer to thieves ‘plucking up, digging up, breaking, spoiling and carrying away’ flowers, shrubs and trees.

Indeed, Kew is no stranger to such crime; the Kew Gardens Constabulary was introduced in 1847.

At first a small band of former soldiers who doubled as gardeners, these days there are eight constables dealing with everything from lost property to plant rustling.

Officials at Kew say there have been cases of women spiriting away plants in their handbags.

But last week’s incident was something different: there is every indication the water lily was the target of a pre-planned operation by an experienced professional.

‘To reach where it was growing 
required several steps across a wet garden — it’s not just someone 
taking advantage or being opportunistic,’ says Barley. ‘They had their 
eye on that particular species.’

The
 corner of the conservatory from which it was stolen is one of a few 
areas not monitored by CCTV cameras — suggesting the thief may have 
scouted out the crime scene.

It may sound far-fetched, but organised plant theft is an increasingly common occurrence.

In 2012, a clump of rare arum maculatum — known as lords-and-ladies or cuckoo-pint — was stolen from a beauty spot in Dovedale, Derbyshire. The stubby green plant with a flower resembling a lily is believed to have been taken by those seeking to profit from its rumoured medicinal benefits.

Some practitioners of alternative medicine mistakenly believe it can cure cancer.

In 2011, a rare 100-year-old filmy fern vanished from the National Trust-run Nymans estate near Haywards Heath, West Sussex.

The estate is a designated Site of Scientific Interest — damaging such an area is an offence under the Wildlife and Countryside Act, punishable by a fine of up to £20,000.

And, in 2010, a lady’s slipper orchid growing on the Silverdale golf course in Lancashire was given police protection, including patrols and CCTV. The measures were taken to avoid a repeat of the 2004 incident that saw a lady’s slipper dug up and stolen from the course overnight.  Private collectors are prepared to pay up to £5,000 for a specimen.

A new breed of plant thieves are targeting ordinary back gardens, too. According to one recent survey, more than a fifth of households have had a plant stolen from their garden.

Exotic species, such as lilies, olive trees, bonsais and magnolia trees, are the most popular targets.

So, just who are the criminals and how do they operate? One theory is that the crime is perpetrated by professional thieves stealing to order for wealthy private collectors.

Anastasiya Timoshyna, of Traffic, a non-governmental organisation that monitors the black market in plants and wildlife, says: ‘We know there are very rich people who will pay up to £10,000 to get their hands on a rare orchid, cactus or lily.’

There is a thriving international black market for rare species, stretching across Europe to the Far East, where many rare plants are valued for medicinal benefits.

Of the 799 illegal plant seizures reported by EU border police in 2012, 42 per cent were packaged as alternative remedies.

Given the sums for which they can swap hands, it’s not surprising that criminal gangs, more accustomed to dealing in drugs or the proceeds of robberies, are turning their attention to plant rustling.

Would-be thieves even advertise on the internet, offering to steal the rarest plants.

Police officers in Scotland have expressed alarm at ‘work parties’ of illegal immigrants being used to steal sphagnum moss (used to line hanging baskets), primroses and snowdrops to sell to nurseries across Britain, with the proceeds being used to fund other criminal activity.

The law on such matters is clear. It is an offence to uproot a wild plant without the permission of the landowner. In the case of rare species, it is also an offence to pick the plants or sell them.

Where plants have been cultivated by a botanical garden, they are private property.

Staff at Kew Gardens said the incident was not isolated, and that there have been other instances of theft in the past

The Metropolitan Police has a dedicated Wildlife Crime Unit and 178 countries have signed the CITES agreement pledging not to trade in stolen plants, but enforcing these laws is extremely difficult. Conviction rates for plant-related crime are extremely low.

Such is the difficulty in tracing stolen plants that East Devon District Council recently took to attaching microchips to council-owned flowers.

Back at Kew, they are stepping up security following the theft of the water lily and appealing to members of the public to be vigilant when visiting the gardens.

Of course, the only way to ensure the safety of plants of such scientific importance would be to remove them from public view — something that Kew says it will have to consider if stocks dwindle.

That would be a terrible shame. As Richard Barley puts it: ‘Putting plants under lock and key would take the joy out of visits here. And it would let the thieves win.’
