A four-month-old baby suffered horrific injuries including six broken bones at the hands of his mother and father who battered him with cutlery and a flex cord, a court heard today.

Doctors found Ethan Sheldon had three broken ribs, a shattered collarbone, a fractured ankle, a broken toe and more than 20 bruises when he was examined in October 2010.

His father Christopher Sheldon, 32, and mother Charlotte, 24, have denied causing the injuries at Plymouth Crown Court.

Experts told the court that the baby must have been hit with blunt objects and had his legs twisted and squeezed during the first four months of his life.

Jo Martin, prosecuting, said doctors 
concluded than Ethan suffered at least three or four 'incidences of 
violence' at the hands of one or both of the defendants.

She said: 'There is no suggestion that
 the broken bones and the bruises which Ethan undoubtedly suffered were 
caused by anything other than an assault or assaults upon him.

'There is no doubt Ethan was hit three or four times by one or both of the defendants with some sort of object.'

Miss Martin said a doctor had 
concluded the pattern of bruising showed he had been struck with a 'long
 and straight object or with a flat object with raised edges.'

One expert suggested he could have been hit by a blunt cutlery piece.

Miss Martin said Ethan may also have been struck with an electric flex cord because the bruises 'followed the curvature of the limbs'.

She added the ribs and collarbone were
 mostly likely broken by squeezing with 'considerable force well in 
excess of everyday handling'.

The child's ankle or tibia could have been 
fractured by holding and twisting of the foot while his toe may have 
been broken by a heavy object being dropped on it.

The court heard the injuries would 
have left Ethan crying in pain for 'two to three days'.

The abuse was discovered after a health worker visited the home on October 5, 2010, and was concerned that Ethan was not putting on weight, the court heard.

His parents could offer no explanation for the injuries and the child was referred to a doctor who immediately referred him to hospital for X-rays.

Miss Martin said both defendants accepted the injuries were non-accidental and nobody else could have caused them but both have denied causing the injuries or even knowing about them.

Christopher Sheldon, of Totnes, Devon, and Charlotte Sheldon, of Plymouth, are both of accused of 'ill-treating or assaulting' Ethan between his birth in May 2010 and October 2010.

The trial continues.
