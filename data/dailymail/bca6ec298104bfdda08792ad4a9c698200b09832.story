At the last race in China it was great to see we were still as strong as we have been all season.

For me personally, qualifying in the rain did not work out for various reasons; partly I didn't do a perfect job and partly some technical faults which meant I qualified fourth.

In the race, I completely lost all the telemetry communication between the car and the engineers so the engineers could never see what was going on, which meant they couldn’t help me on track – I was completely on my own!

The team, and all the engineers, are always following what is going on inside my car via telemetry. So during a race they help me with things like fuel consumption, tyre pressures, settings, the balance of my car - so at a pit-stop they can correct an imbalance – and brake balance. In China, I had none of that help.  So, I had to drive according to what I felt and had to handle things, like fuel consumption, on my own.

Normally, they have sensors inside the tyres, too, which show my team what the pressures are at any moment in time. Tyre pressures are really, really important for the car performance, so I was hugely compromised.

They also couldn't set the clutch setting, which you need to start a race, so I had a terrible start and ended up way down in seventh after the first corner.

From then on I fought my way back through the field, and it was great to still finish the race second – it was the perfect damage limitation after a very sub-optimal weekend because so many things went wrong. It shows how good our car is and how good our team is.

We've had a three-week break so there has been a lot of time for the teams to develop their cars – which this year, more than ever, will be a very fast development race – so we are expecting everybody to bring much faster cars to this week's race.

The Spanish Grand Prix is always a milestone in the season; if you are quickest here then it is likely that you are going to be the quickest for many more races to come.

I have spent time in the factory this week working with the guys and I had a big talk with the whole factory on Wednesday just to say 'thanks' and to give them some insight into what is going on.

I was also in the simulator, preparing for Barcelona and the race weekend.  Barcelona is, of course, a track that I know better than any of the circuits. I have driven here so much because we usually do all of our winter testing here. I like the track and it should suit our car which leaves me optimistic for the weekend.

I went well here last year – I secured pole position – so everything is pointing towards a good weekend ahead.

My team-mate Lewis Hamilton has come off three wins in Malaysia, Bahrain and China now, so it is important to try and break his momentum, turn it around, and get the win myself this weekend, so I am aiming to do just that.

Team game: Mercedes are bidding for their fourth straight one-two finish at this weekend's Spanish Grand Prix

I went to the opening round of the DTM championship in Germany last weekend. While I was there, it was a great pleasure to drive five-time world champion Juan Manuel Fangio's 1954 Mercedes.

Georg, my PR manager, had the idea of doing a 'selfie' while I was driving, and the video and photos turned out really well. Nobody has done that before, so that was a new one!

I am proud because when driving Fangio's car you clearly see the history of the Silver Arrows in Formula One which is just massive.

Compatriots: Rosberg poses with Lukas Podolski

In between races I spent time with my friends, family and fiancee, trained and re-energised for the European season. I also met Lukas Podolski, one of Germany's best players.

I played some soccer with him on the river in Cologne. I'm huge fan of football, so it is always great to meet the players.

Lukas is an easy-going and a nice guy. He was telling me that Arsenal still have the FA Cup final against Hull to come which is a big thing for them. And in terms of the World Cup he is very excited and he is looking forward to that. I will be meeting the Germany team in their training camp after the Monaco Grand Prix so that will be lots of fun, too.

Last week marked the 20th anniversary of Ayrton Senna's death, but we mustn't forget that two drivers lost their lives at the 1994 San Marino Grand Prix. Roland Ratzenberger was killed in qualifying on a tragic weekend for the sport.

I find it unfortunate that it is always just Senna who is mentioned because he had a bit more success.  That said, Senna is a legend of the sport and one of the best of all time. It was a great loss.

I remember the weekend very well. I was sitting in Monaco in our kitchen waiting for many, many hours with my mum and cousin, listening to the radio for an update.

Because of that awful weekend, the safety in the sport has moved on massively. There was a big push after that, and we are still benefiting from it today. We need to keep pushing because the sport needs to be safer and safer, but it is going in the right direction which is fantastic to see.
