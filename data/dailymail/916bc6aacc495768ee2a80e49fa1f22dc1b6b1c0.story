A South Florida couple who operated a 'butt implant' practice out of their own home have been found guilty for practicing health care without a license.

Samela Hernandez, 55, and Pedro Hernandez, 59, received a two year sentence of house arrest, with permission to work from the Miami-Dade Circuit Court.

The married couple were arrested in December 2012 after a botched enhancement procedure on a exotic dancer that left her permanently disfigured.

Authorities in Florida said the pair would inject dangerous silicone cement into the backsides of their mostly female customers - who usually went overseas for the controversial and dangerous cosmetic treatment.

However, the couple's lawyer, Robert Perez, told the Miami Herald that despite a lack of medical qualifications, the Hernandez's were skilled practicioners of butt implants.

'Of the hundreds of patients, only one person came forward to complain,' said their lawyer, Robert Perez. 'Everyone else was satisfied with their posteriors.'

Samela Hernandez had previously worked in Colombia, where butt implants are common and authorities in Florida said she would use a cocktail of sealant and silicone for the buttock boost.

She denied this and said the silicon-based solution she used was legal in Colombia but banned in America.

When the couple were arrested, detectives in Hialeah found syringes, Lidocaine, plus swaps and other medical equipment.

There were two other women inside the house at the time who told police they were at the Hernandez's for treatment.

The exotic dancer who made the complaint to police said that when she developed infections and open sores, the couple injected, 'more solution into the void area of her buttocks to 'fill in' the gaps between the welts'.

In recent years, Florida has become a center for illegal silicone based buttock enhancements.

Oneal Ron Morris, 22, is accused of leaving women ill and disfigured after injecting them with a mixture of toxic substances, including super glue, Fix-A-Flat and cement, at homes across Florida.

In addition to multiple counts of practicing medicine without a license with serious bodily injury, she is also facing a manslaughter charge after one of her 'patients' died following surgery.

And earlier this month, a former runner-up in Brazil's Miss BumBum competition revealed the terrible harm filelrs had done to her body.

Andressa Urach, 27, spent a month in intensive care and feared she would lose her leg after fillers 'rotted' her muscles and had to be removed, triggering a life-threatening infection.
