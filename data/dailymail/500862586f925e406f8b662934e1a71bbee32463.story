A group calling itself 'The Women of the 99 Percent' is making robocalls across the United States in an attempt to link Republican members of the House of Representatives to 'the war on women led by Rush Limbaugh'.

The automated calls are illegal because they do not state who they are from (there is no known group called The Women of the 99 Percent) or provide a callback number, as required under the U.S. Telephone Consumer Protection Act of 1991.

They appear to be the most aggressive attempt yet by Democrats to exploit politically the recent furore over comments by the controversial conservative radio talk show host.

Controversy: Rush Limbaugh kicked off a national firestorm with his comments

Limbaugh apologised last Sunday for his 'insulting word choices' when speaking about Sandra Fluke, a student activist campaigning for contraception to be paid for by Georgetown University, a Catholic institution, under President Barack Obama's healthcare reform.

The radio host had said she was a 'slut' because she was asking to be paid for having sex and then commented that she should repay the public by releasing videos of her sexual activities 'so we can all watch'.

Limbaugh's comments had been widely denounced, including by John Boehner, Republican Speaker of the House of Representatives, and Barack Obama, in what Republicans branded an attempt to make political capital, telephoned Fluke to commiserate.

Democrats have been taking Republicans to task over the comments. David Axelrod, the Obama campaign's top strategist, said that Mitt Romney, the Republican frontrunner, had failed 'a test of leadership' over 'the Limbaugh thing'. He ask how if a candidate couldn't stand up to 'the most strident voices in your party, how can he stand up to Ahmadinejad?'

Activist: The radio host called Sandra Fluke a 'slut' after she spoke out in favour of easy access to contraception

A call left on the answering machine of Paula Bolyard of Doylestown, Ohio yesterday stated: 'Hello, this is a message from Women of the 99 Percent. Congressman Jim Renacci is condoning the war on women led by Rush Limbaugh, who has become the de facto leader of the Republican party.

'Call Congressman Renacci at 330-489-4414 and ask him why he remains silent while Republican spokesman Rush Limbaugh insults, degrades, and verbally abuses women. Tell Congressman Renacci that it’s just plain shameful that he that he allows Rush Limbaugh’s behaviour to continue. We are the Women of the 99 Percent and we won’t be silent anymore.'

As well Mrs Bolyard's Ohio-16 district of Representative Jim Renacci, there were similar calls in Rep. Roscoe Bartlett's Maryland-6, Rep. Dan Benishek's Michigan-1, Rep. Judy Biggert's Illinois-13, Rep. Tim Johnson's Illinois-15, Rep. Bobby Schilling's Illinois-17 and Rep. Scott Rigell's Virginia-2.

The robocalls prompted hundreds of angry calls to Republican congressional offices.

Target: Constituents of Ohio Republican Jim Renacci have been contacted by a robocall focussed around Mr Limbaugh

Mrs Bolyard sent out a tweet about the call and then posted an audio file of it on the RedState website after being contacted by MailOnline.

In a blog post, she wrote: 'Apparently, unless you are throwing a public temper tantrum about Rush’s inappropriate and malicious comments, you are "condoning" them. By this standard, 99 per cent of the country is guilty.'

She added: 'We should all feel great compassion for the poor souls who had to answer the phones and listen to the angry rants that resulted from these robocalls.'

A blogger called 'Corinthian Scales' from Michigan wrote that the claim against Rep Dan Benishek was 'one wildly outrageous accusation to make by an unidentified "group" who, by the way, is now intruding into the privacy of my home.

'Hmmm... no number shows on the caller ID, and *69 only prompts the phone company's recorded message that they are unable to determine the phone number used.'

Criticism: John Boehner, Speaker of the Hous of Representatives, is one of many Republicans to have spoken out against Mr Limbaugh

Last week, the Democratic 
Congressional Campaign Committee (DCCC) organised a petition accusing 
Republicans of having 'launched an all-out war on women'.

The
 petition said that Republicans were 'trying to silence women who stand 
against their radical agenda' and Americans had witnessed 'top 
Republican leaders squirm at denouncing or even criticising Rush 
Limbaugh after he called women's health care advocate Sandra Fluke a 
"slut" and a "prostitute" on his radio show.'

Phil Bloomer, spokesman for Rep. Johnson, said that some people calling as a result of the robocalls were not even in the congressman's district but part of a new district created after boundary changes he will be running for in November - a sign the calls are linked to this year's elections.

He said: 'How do we not "allow" Rush Limbaugh to say what he wants? We believe in free speech. At the same time, we don’t condone name-calling or caustic language from either the Left or Right. That is why Representative Johnson formed the Center Aisle Caucus in 2005 and continually advocates civility.'

Andrea Pivarunas, spokeswoman for Rep. Schilling, said: 'We were surprised to hear this since Representative Schilling spoke out about this days ago.

'He stated Mr Limbaugh’s comments on the religious freedom issue are deplorable and wrong, just as he also feels that the Obama Administration is wrong to violate the religious conscience rights of others. We hope the organisation spreading these inaccurate statements will issue a retraction.'

Telephone calls and emails to the DCCC and the Democratic National Committee asking whether either organisation was connected to the robocalls were not returned.
