For nearly half a century, it has been the nerve-centre of some of the country’s most high profile police investigations – including the IRA’s mainland bombing campaign in the 1970s, the disappearance of Lord Lucan and the July 2005 terror attacks.

With its famous revolving sign outside, New Scotland Yard has also become one of London’s most iconic buildings, a popular destination on the tourist trail and served as a backdrop to thousands of TV crime reports.

But not for much longer, after it was announced today today that the office block has been sold to an investment company in Abu Dhabi for £370million as part of a radical cost-cutting plan which will see the new HQ located in a much smaller building a few miles away. 

The current HQ – known to many in the police simply as ‘The Yard’ - has been home to the Met since 1967 and today it is surrounded by concrete barriers to protect it from terrorist attack.

But as these pictures from 47 years ago show, things were very different when the building was opened.

There were no need for bomb-proof barricades outside to protect police from enemy attack, no need for armed officers to patrol the perimeter of the building, let alone the deployment of dozens of CCTV cameras.

Members of the public could simply walk into New Scotland Yard off the street, with no need to go through airport style security to reach the reception area.

In the Z-Cars, Dixon of Dock Green era, things were radically different inside, too.

With their starched blue shirts and short back and sides haircuts, the officers of 1967 seem a world away from the image of the modern day copper. 

It was a time when Great Train Robber Ronnie Biggs was on the run from Wandsworth Prison; the Kray twins were running amok in the East End; and the Met was still mourning the murder of three officers gunned down by career criminal Harry Roberts in Shepherd's Bush the previous year.

Seatbelts had just been introduced to cars; in July, the police breathalyser arrived. In September, a 'new style' uniform was unveiled for female officers.

As they stored paper files, examined a giant map of London in the map room, and answered calls via a rudimentary switchboard, surely none of these officers could ever have imagined how 47 years later, officers would be bogged down by multi-million pound computer databases and call centres, target-obsessed politicians and politically correct diversity units.

Indeed the first police computer had been installed only four years earlier: its purpose was to manage the payroll and statistics, rather than track criminals.

The Met plans to move its head office to a smaller former police station which has been empty for the last three years. The Curtis Green site on Victoria Embankment along the River Thames will become the force's head office in 2016 and will be known simply as Scotland Yard.

The relocation is designed to help the force save six million pounds a year in running costs and avoid the £50million expense needed to refurbish the current head office, it said.

Curtis Green will have desk space for 1,000 officers, less than half the number in the current building, using mobile technology to enable officers to work more flexibly. The revolving triangle will be moved to the new site.

Originally bought from Land Securities in 2008 for £123million, the current New Scotland Yard building was marketed as ‘Ten Broadway’ and had a guide price of £250million - well above initial estimates of £150million, thanks to soaring London property prices.

The HQ of the Met has moved before – from Whitehall Place to Great Scotland Yard in 1875, to the Norman Shaw building in 1890 and to the current building in 1967. This future move therefore marks a return to nearer its founding location, the force says.

London Mayor Boris Johnson said the Met needs a home fit for the future, but police budgets are under real pressure.

The Metropolitan Police has sold its home since 1967, pictured left, for £370 million to Abu Dhabi investors. The iconic revolving sign, right, which has now become a tourist attraction, will move to the new building in 2016

He said today: ‘The sale of this under-used and outdated building means we can now not only protect that rich heritage, but also fund the new HQ and kit out bobbies with the latest mobile technology to secure the future of the force.

‘This landmark deal allows us to preserve the past whilst giving today's Met a vital cash boost so our officers can go on keeping London safe.’

But it is not only traditionalists who are mourning the imminent closure of News Scotland Yard.

Pub landlords in the vicinity of the current HQ – where pubs popular with thirsty officers include The Old Star, the Feathers and the Buckingham Arms - are expecting a significant drop in takings when the Met moves home.
