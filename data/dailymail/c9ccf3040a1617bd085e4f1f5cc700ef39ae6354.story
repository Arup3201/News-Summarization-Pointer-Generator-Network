The boss of the Royal Bank of Scotland has admitted that it could be years before taxpayers get their money back.

As the State-backed lender announced a seventh consecutive year of huge losses, Ross McEwan could offer little assurance to households who contributed to its £46 billion bailout in 2008.

The New Zealander said it was ‘certainly not going to be months’ before the bank was ready to return to the private sector, before adding it would be ‘much shorter’ than ten years.

Ross McEwan, chief executive of RBS yesterday announced losses of £3.5billion during a press conference 

Andy Sylvester, from the TaxPayers’ Alliance, said Mr McEwan’s remarks ‘will leave taxpayers cold’, adding: ‘The bank bailouts have placed a tremendous burden on taxpayers and it is a weight that needs to be lifted.’ The bleak prognosis came as RBS, which is 79 per cent owned by taxpayers, slumped to a £3.5bn loss last year. 

This takes its total losses since its collapse to almost £50bn, and the news wiped more than £1bn off the bank’s value as shares fell more than 4 per cent to 386.6p. Expectations had been high that RBS could be returning to normality, having made a £2.6bn profit in the first half of the year, but a £2.2bn bill for fines and litigation and a £4bn charge on its US business have blown it off course.

The huge loss is also a setback for George Osborne, who had been hoping both RBS and Lloyds would be back in the black before the election.

It also came as another pay row flared up, with RBS dishing out £483 million in bonuses to staff – although this was down from £576m the previous year.

Mr McEwan, who forfeited a £1 million shares payment for the second year running after taking the helm in October 2013, said the bonus culture was ‘not something I am going to change or can change today’. He added: ‘I need to be in a position to pay fair pay for people to do these jobs. There are some fairly technical jobs that we need to get right.’ But Mr Osborne said the bank must go further to curb pay.

The RBS news will be a disappointment to Chancellor George Osborne, picture, wanted the see the bailed-out bank back in the black in advance of the election 

In a letter to Sir Howard Davies, the boss of the Airports Commission who was confirmed yesterday as RBS’s new chairman, he said: ‘I look to you and Ross McEwan personally to ensure that the entirety of the bank’s business is conducted to the very highest ethical standards.’

He added that his priorities included turning RBS into ‘a British bank focused on the British economy, with lower bonuses and with a plan to get the taxpayers’ money back’.

Last night Cathy Jamieson MP, the shadow financial secretary to the Treasury, said: ‘While it’s good that Ross McEwan has taken a lead on rejecting his allowance, people will be taken aback at the scale of bonuses.’

Former chairman Sir Philip Hampton said it was ‘like Groundhog Day’, adding that the bank’s litigation charges – which turned a £3.5bn profit into the huge loss – had overshadowed a ‘really impressive year of achievement’.
