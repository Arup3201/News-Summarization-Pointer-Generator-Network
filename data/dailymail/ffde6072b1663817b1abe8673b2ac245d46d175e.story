Investment: Oracle CEO Larry Ellison, worth an estimated $36billion, has reached a deal to purchase 98 per cent of Lanai

Technology billionaire Larry Ellison has seen off Bill Gates to snap up a share of Hawaiian island Lanai.

The Oracle CEO, worth an estimated $36billion, reached a deal to purchase 98 per cent of the paradise inlay yesterday, according to Hawaii Governor Neil Abercrombie.

There were rumours Ellison, who already has a house on the island, was in the running as was Gates, who got married to wife Melinda on the island in 1994.

Current owner, self-made billionaire David Murdock said he would keep his home on Lanai and the 
right to build a wind farm, a controversial project that would place 
windmills on as many as 20 square miles of the island and deliver power 
to Oahu through an undersea cable.

The final price tag for the 141 
square miles was not immediately clear, but the asking price had been 
put at between $500million and $600million, according to reports.

Lanai is relatively untouched 
compared to other Hawaiian holiday hotspots, with only 30 miles of paved
roads on the 141 square-mile island, according to Associated Press.

It is home to 3,200 residents and boasts several luxury resorts. Holiday makers
and explorers come to see the lunar landscapes of Keahiakawelo (or the 
'Garden of the Gods') and Pu'u Pehe, which is also known as Sweetheart 
Rock, as well as take advantage of the stunning coastline.

Holiday hotspot: Lanai is the smallest publicly-accessible island in Hawaii

Trumped: Microsoft billionaire Bill Gates, who had his wedding on the island in 1994, was rumoured to have been in the running to buy the island

As such Lanai is a developer's dream.
But, just like George Clooney's character land baron Matt King in the 
film The Descendants, officials are concerned that a new buyer will 
over-develop the unspoiled land.

Mr Murdock said in a statement that selling Lanai was not an impulsive 
decision, but he has been looking for a buyer who would have the right 
enthusiasm, commitment and respect for the island's residents.

He said: 'I have learned in life that change is inevitable and can be quite positive when guided in the right direction.'

Abercrombie said Ellison has had a 
longstanding interest in the island. 'We look forward to welcoming Mr 
Ellison in the near future,' he said.

'His passion for nature, particularly the ocean is well known specifically in the realm of America's Cup sailing.'

Unspoiled: The area is relatively untouched, compared to other areas in Hawaii, with only 30 miles of paved roads on the 141 square-mile island

Lush terrain: The only major developments on the island, which was formerly famous for its pineapples, have been two Four Season's hotels and two golf courses

Protected: Just like George Clooney's character in The Descendants, the mayor of the island is concerned new buyers will over-develop the area

With a reported price tag of £600million, Lanai did not come cheap.

But the undisclosed final amount is a relative drop in the crystal clear ocean for new owner Larry Ellison, whose net worth is estimated at £36billion, according to Forbes.

The 67-year-old is sixth on Forbes' list of global billionaires, but four below Microsoft giant Bill Gates who was rumoured to have been in the running to buy the 141 sq mile inlay, where he married wife Melinda in 1994.

Ellison, a keen yachtsman - he won the America's Cup in 2010 - has been divorced four times. His friend, the late Apple boss Steve Jobs, was the official photographer at Ellison's fourth wedding to romance novelist Melanie Craft. They divorced in 2010. The new owner of Lanai is a licensed pilot and owns several private jets. As you'd expect he also owns an array of supercars and has a penchant for the Acura NSX, which he doles out as gifts.

He has a keen property portfolio, which includes a Californian estate worth an estimated $110m and more than 12 properties in Malibu. The entertainment system in one of his houses is also rumoured to have cost $1million and includes a rock concert-sized video projector at one end of a drained swimming pool.

The deal involves 88,000 acres of 
land, plus two resorts, two golf courses, a stable and various 
residential and commercial buildings, lawyers for Murdock told the 
utilities commission in its application.

Ellison plans to pay cash, and the 
deal should result in new jobs, economic stimulus and a reinvigorated 
local tourism industry, the application said.

'The buyer anticipates making 
substantial investments in Lanai and is looking forward to partnering 
with the people of Lanai to chart the island's future,' Castle & 
Cooke lawyers said in the application.

Lanai is known as Pineapple Island
as in 1922, James Dole, the president of the Hawaiian Pineapple 
Company, bought the land and turned it into the world's largest 
plantation of the fruit.

However, Mr Murdock halted the 
heritage industry on the island when he acquired the fruit and vegetable
company (and turned it into the world's largest producer in the 
process).

But he was more 
modest in the development of Lanai's big-scale tourism industry, 
approving only two major luxury Four Season's resorts and two golf 
courses. 

However, as the 
island is already a popular tourist destination, with 26,000 people 
already visiting the island this year, according to the Hawaii Tourism 
Association, Ellison may want to take advantage of the money-making potential of the area.
