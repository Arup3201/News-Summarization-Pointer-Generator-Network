Dereck Chisora wants to make amends for his ugly brawl with veteran American heavyweight Kevin Johnson by fighting Alexander Povetkin in Moscow this April. 

London’s Del Boy has asked promoter Frank Warren to lure Povetkin into the fight by offering the Russian home advantage.

Be careful what you wish for, Dereck.

Be careful about granting that wish, Frank.

Slugfest: Dereck Chisora (right) lands a big right hand during his win against Kevin Johnson on Saturday night

Unconvincing: Chisora admitted afterwards that he was 'gutted' by his performance in the ring

Povetkin is not the best heavyweight on the planet but he is dangerous enough to place in jeopardy the final eliminator for a challenge to Wladimir Klitschko’s WBO title, towards which Chisora and Tyson Fury are supposed to be on collision course this summer.

Chisora persevered for a lop-sided points win over Johnson and was man enough, also, to admit that he was ‘gutted’ by the deficiencies in his own performance.

Raggedly though he boxed, Chisora was able to overwhelm the ageing Johnson with the non-stop aggression which is the most obvious benefit of his rededication to the rigours of the prize-ring.But Povetkin is younger, hungrier and as high on work-rate as Chisora.

His only defeat was to Klitschko himself and of his 26 victories 18 have been inflicted by knockout.Nor is it all likely that Chisora would get away in Moscow with all the rabbit punches to which British referee Terry O’Connor mostly turned a blind eye in the Copper Box at London’s Olympic Park on Saturday night.

It is not beyond Del Boy to come home from Moscow with a win but this fight would be no stroll in Gorky Park.

There is a lot of money to be made fighting in Russia these days, if perhaps not quite as much as for a slugfest with Fury at a London football ground.

So although Chisora is still talking of how ‘me and Tyson will still get it on in mid-summer,’ he may be calculating that a spectacular KO of Povetkin could fast-track him straight to Klitschko.If that were to happen, Tyson really would be Furious.

The Manchester giant fulfilled his part of the elimination bargain by knocking out US journeyman Joey Abell in the co-feature at the Copper Box and is scheduled to return there for another tune-up on April 11. He has been expecting Chisora to do the same.

That way they could monitor each other’s progress -  Chisora in re-sharpening his skills, Fury in shedding the surplus poundage.

In
 the process of getting fight-fit again Chisora seems to have mislaid 
his jab and become reliant on round-house swings to the back of the 
head.

Very heavyweight: Fury was visibly carrying excess baggage during his fight at the Copper Box

While kept out of action for almost a year by David Haye’s double withdrawal from their big-money showdown, Fury has put on too much weight even for his 6ft 9in frame. He came in on Saturday at nigh-on 20 stones, a career high.

That was OK for a KO against Abell in
 four slam-bang rounds but when it comes to more threatening opposition 
he needs the motivation to hone down to the 18 stones at which he beat 
Chisora in their first encounter.

Fury
 is a true entertainer and Chisora can exude menace. But if they do 
complete the elimination journey then whichever of them goes on to 
challenge Klitschko needs to do so in prime physical condition and razor
 sharp.

Risky business: Alexander Povetkin (right) would represent a seriously tough test for Chisora

Khan still on course for Mayweather megafight

Speculation continues to swirl like wild fires in California about Floyd Mayweather’s next fight, for which Amir Khan has signed a contract to meet the world’s pound-for-pound king on May 3.

But one piece of conjecture, at least, has been doused by Richard Schaefer, chief executive of Golden Boy whose job it is to oversee the organisation of Mayweather’s mega-million-dollar nights on the Las Vegas Strip.

Rumour had it that either Khan or Marcos Maidana – who the British fighter has already beaten in the ring, and who was also in Mayweather’s Twitter poll to let the fans choose his next opponent - would step down to meet Adrien Broner on the same bill.

Who's your Money on? Amir Khan is in pole position to fight Floyd Mayweather in Las Vegas on May 3

Schaefer says: ‘No, not all. I am waiting on Floyd but have a pretty good idea what’s going to happen and what the undercard will look like.’

For Khan, the long wait goes on and he is pondering a quick trip to Vegas from his training camp near San Francisco this week to seek confirmation.

Froch and Groves rematch has already started... in words

George Groves and Carl Froch are both claiming victory in the wars of words and negotiations which are preceding their much-anticipated rematch on May 31.

No surprise there. It was exactly the same prior to their first world super-middleweight title fight.

Groves says he has forced Froch to meet him a second time, with the help of soaring public demand. Froch says he is doing this for the public, as well as to ‘stop Groves whining’ about the premature way he was stopped last year.

Whatever the reason, the public to whom they both refer are the winners.

What promises to be another colossal fight is coming.

This time to a football ground near you.
