Bill Clinton's name being recently linked to registered sex offender Jeffrey Epstein has greatly upset his wife, according to a report published Thursday.

An unnamed source told Page Six 'Talk in Washington is that Hillary is furious with Bill about all this new information on Jeffrey Epstein.' 

Court documents from 2011 describe Clinton's connection to Epstein, the news outlet reported. Epstein was convicted in 2008 for soliciting prostitution from a minor.

An excerpt of the documents, obtained by The Smoking Gun, said from 2002 to 2005 that 'Clinton frequently flew with Epstein aboard his plane, then suddenly stopped - raising the suspicion that the friendship abruptly ended, perhaps because of events related to Epstein's sexual abuse of children.

It continued 'Epstein's personal phone directory from his computer contains e-mail addresses for Clinton along with 21 phone numbers for him, including those of his assistant (Doug Band), his schedulers, and what appear to be Clinton's personal numbers.

'This information certainly leads one to believe that Clinton might well be a source of relevant information and efforts to obtain discovery from him were reasonably calculated to lead to admissable evidence.'

However, Clinton was not deposed by the lawyers representing Epstein's alleged victims, The Smoking Gun reported.

The Clintons went to St. Ignatius Loyola Church earlier this week for the funeral of Mario Cuomo, the former governor of New York. Onlookers claimed to see Bill Clinton 'waiting by the front door for a long time' while speaking to Page Six.

A source told the website 'People assumed he was waiting for [Mario Cuomo's widow] Matilda Cuomo. But then Hillary came storming in right past him.'

The source additionally claimed Hillary Clinton, the former Secretary of State, appeared upset with her husband.

Page Six noted that Clinton and Epstein are no longer friends.  

Photos show that the Clintons had their arms wrapped around one another while leaving the Upper East Side church later in the day - with both of them flashing smiles. 

A spokesperson for Hillary Clinton told Page Six it was 'Utter nonsense,' with the website reporting that a spokesperson for her husband 'made a customarily snide comment.'

Representatives for both Clintons did not immediately return messages seeking comment from Daily Mail Online.
