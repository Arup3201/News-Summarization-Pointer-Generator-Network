An easyJet plane had to abort its landing just seconds before it touched down because it was caught in a huge gust of wind.

The a320 aircraft was in the final moments of its approach into Luton Airport when the pilot was forced to bring the wheels up.

He had already attempted to land in the high winds, but had to pull up after overshooting the runway.

Steady: The easyJet a320 had straightened up after being swayed by the winds as it headed towards the runway

Final moments: The wheels were almost touching the runway at Luton Airport as it reached the last stages of the approach

Gust: The wind then jolted the aircraft to the right, forcing the wing towards the ground

As it came down for the second approach, the plane was swayed side to side by the wind.

It was only a few feet from the ground when the pilot had to pull up for a second time.

The photographer said he thought the wings were going to hit the runway.

Trevor Nash, 52, from Hemel Hempstead was out walking his dog when he saw the plane making an initial approach.

He told Mail Online: 'One plane overshot the runway, and then came back 20 minutes later.

'It looked a bit odd as it was coming in. I could barely stand up the wind was so strong.

'But I just started taking photographs.

Abort: The nose of the plane then lifts up as the pilot chooses to abandon the landing

'Suddenly, the plane flipped to the left, then straightened. Just as it was about to land, it suddenly tipped to the right and had to abandon the landing.

'I thought the wing was going to hit the floor, it could not have been more than four or five feet off the ground.

'I would not have wanted to be on that plane.'

A spokesman for the airline said: 'easyJet can confirm that an empty positioning flight from Stansted to Luton performed a "go around" at Luton and returned to Stansted due to the windy conditions at Luton.  

'Although the pictures may appear dramatic the winds were within operating limits and there were no passengers onboard the flight. easyJet's pilots are highly trained in order to manage these kind of situations. The aircraft landed routinely at Luton later the same day.

'An internal safety report was filed in accordance with the airline's procedures. Safety is the airline's highest priority.'
