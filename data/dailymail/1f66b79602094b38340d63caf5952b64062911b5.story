The 1812 Overture may have its cannons, but there has never been a symphony quite like the one performed in Spain this week where all the 'music' was provided by roaring farm tractors.

The resulting cacophony left audience members baffled and a little deaf after watching 12 diesel behemoths whining, groaning and belching out exhaust smoke for nearly half-an-hour.

The tractor symphony was performed in the Spanish city of Valencia and opened the country's oldest festival of contemporary music, which has been running since 1978.

A symphony written using engine noises from 12 diesel tractors opened a music festival in Valencia, Spain

The half-hour 'musical' number was lead by Swedish conductor Sven-Ake Johansson (pictured)

Swede Sven-Ake Johansson conducted the farmyard ensemble like he was standing before violinists and cello players.

'Yes, I am the soloist,' said the driver of one old tractor, a farmer named Hector Latorre. 'There are few tractors like this, and the director likes a lot of noise,' he added.

Audience member Mampu Perea Badillo said: 'It was a load of old rubbish. It might appeal to anoraks who like to listen to the different strains of engines, and get their jollies sniffing diesel smoke, but anyone who likes music was left baffled.

However, audience members were left unimpressed, with one onlooker calling it 'a load of old rubbish'

The festival director said he wanted to break the stereotype that all classical music was 'elitist'

'I think they would have been better opening the festival with a load of half-empty water glasses being played. At least they would have made a tune. This lot sounded like a garage workshop on a bad day.'

Joan Cervero, director of the music festival, said: 'We wanted to start this festival breaking the stereotype that the contemporary music is elitist.'

Elpido Lopez, clarinettist and also the driver of one of the tractor, said: 'It is an adventure, a new experience.'

'It certainly was,' added Miguel Lopez, another audience member. 'And not one I want to repeat.'
