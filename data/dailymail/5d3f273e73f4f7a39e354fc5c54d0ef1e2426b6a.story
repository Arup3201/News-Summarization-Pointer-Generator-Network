Arsenal might want to spend a little time with their noses buried in Nigel Pearson's book of on-field wrestling holds.

They had Leicester by the throat on Tuesday night thanks to goals from Laurent Koscielny and Theo Walcott, but somehow relaxed their grip and turned what seemed like a procession into a nail-biter.

Pearson would never make an elementary mistake like that as James McArthur can testify.

Leicester replied through Andrej Kramaric, with his first goal since signing last month, and produced the aggression and spirit which will make their manager proud, and offer some hope for the relegation scrap ahead.

They pushed for the equaliser, Kramaric missed a wonderful late chance and they probably deserved to take a point, but they left with none and remain rock bottom of the Barclays Premier League.

Arsenal moved almost apologetically into the top four, for at a day at least, responding to defeat in the North London derby as Tottenham dropped points at Liverpool, but this made for uneasy viewing at times for Arsene Wenger.

It was a seventh win in eight games since New Year's Day but not the first time this season his team has panicked at the first sign of trouble. They surrendered the lead at Spurs, not to mention Anderlecht and Liverpool.

In fact, it has happened a little too often for a side with pretentions of challenging for major honours; a character flaw which remains despite the impressive win at Manchester City last month.

There were added concerns with injuries to Alexis Sanchez, who returned after a hamstring injury but hurt his knee and was under-par until replaced, and Aaron Ramsey lasted only nine minutes before succumbing to a third hamstring strain of the campaign.

'I cannot say it is not a worry,' said Wenger; a double negative within the overall positive of clinging onto the lead. 'It is not good news.'

Sanchez later delivered a cryptic tweet hinting that his injury may have been more than a 'knock' as the manager claimed.

On a night when Hull and QPR won, there was some encouragement for Pearson and his chairman Vichai Srivaddhanaprabha, who is thought to have sacked the manager on Sunday before a change of heart.

The manager said he had lunch with the owners but didn't offer to pay and sat just behind the Thai owner in the first-half before moving down to the touchline for the second-half revival.

Pearson said he had spoken to McArthur on the eve of the game and apologised after a text message from the Crystal Palace midfielder and received a warm post-match handshake and words of support from Wenger.

'I am surprised they are bottom of league and they want to get rid of their manager,' said the Arsenal boss. 'If they keep quiet, don't panic and stick together, they will get out of that. They are one of better teams we've played.'

Leicester's performance will have offered great satisfaction - certainly more appealing than the Canadian folk band he endured on Sunday as speculation raged about his future at the club.

Playing well and losing is not a good habit to be in but the players are working hard for him, none more than Riyad Mahrez, who was outstanding on the right wing and gave the Arsenal problems all game with his energy and direct style.

Mahrez opened with a dangerous low cross, almost deflected into his own net by Koscielny, and an effort which clipped David Ospina on the knee and flashed wide.

Pearson had tweaked his usual system to deploy wing-backs and three central defenders, including debuts for Robert Huth, signed on transfer deadline day, and Matthew Upson, signed last summer but absent until now with ankle problems.

Unfortunately for Upson, he did not last the game and came soon after the break, although the manager claimed it was 'precautionary'.

Wenger's team, however, were soon in control. Mark Schwarzer stood up to block with his chest from Walcott and Mesut Ozil danced through a crowded penalty box before forcing another save.

Schwarzer tipped Ozil's effort wide and from the corner, taken by the German, Arsenal went ahead. Koscielny caught Wes Morgan napping and met the low, in-swinging set-piece on the half-volley, sweeping it inside the post from six yards.

Before the break, Schwarzer was unable to hold a fierce drive by Ozil and parried the ball towards Walcott on the right, who adjusted superbly well to the rebound, arriving at pace to thump a first-time drive into the far corner.

Ozil's influence since his return from injury has been impressive. Although not always in the thick of the action, he has made telling contributions in front of goal and his creative juices were flowing again.

Arsenal looked capable of matching the five they put past Aston Villa in their previous home game but were forced back and wobbled under this pressure.

Kramaric pulled one back as the home side claimed Esteban Cambiasso had handled as the ball was trapped under his body in a scramble following a corner they failed to clear, but no free-kick was given and the goal was fired through a crowd by the £9million Croatian, signed in January.

Anxiety washed around the stadium and Wenger sent on substitutes and Pearson sent on the strikers he had left on the bench.

Mahrez went close again and Kramaric was clean through and attempted to chip Ospina. It was an ambitious move – a bad decision - and he did not clear the goalkeeper. Pearson and his staff threw up their arms in collective dismay. It would be their last chance of the night.
