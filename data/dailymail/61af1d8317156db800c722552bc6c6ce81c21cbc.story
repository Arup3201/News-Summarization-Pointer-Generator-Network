A farm is letting customers pump milk straight from the cow after installing a new vending machine that cuts out the milkman.

Farmer Alan Hewson, 56, who runs Crossroads Farm in Eastwell, Leicestershire, installed the machine to give his customers the freshest milk possible.

The only process the milk goes through to get from the udder to the mouth is pasteurisation, which kills bacteria.

The milk is pasteurised before being stored in a tank so customers to remove however much they want

The freshly pumped liquid, once pasteurised, is transferred into the tank of the vending machine, which visitors to the farm can use to fill up their bottle.

Mr Hewson, who runs the farm and creamery with his wife Jane, 57, is allowing customers to pour themselves milk, produced by Alan's 60 Red Poll cows, which graze just yards away, for just £1 a litre.

Father of five Mr Hewson said: 'You can't get much fresher than this. The milk isn't homogenised so the cream will separate naturally from the milk.

'People can either shake the milk to mix it all back up, or if they fancy semi-skimmed simply take the cream from the top.'

Visitors can choose how much milk they want by pressing the 'stop' button when they have enough and if they haven't got a traditional pint bottle they can buy a re-usable container for £2.

The mechanism within the machine automatically calculates how much milk has been drained and it also gives out change.

Mr Hewson, who runs the farm with his wife Jane, 57, hopes the machine will mean almost none of his milk is wasted

Most of the farm's milk, produced by their Red Polls cow herd, is used to make a cheese called Colwick

Mr Hewson said: 'It has been amazing how popular the vending machine has been. It has just spread by word of mouth.

'We had two girls come to sample the milk after they heard people talking about it down the local pub. We are out of the way in location but there is a steady stream of motorists who travel in this area.

'We are happy to offer milk straight from the cow - a nutritious and wonderful tasting milk which a lot of people have never experienced before.'

The Hewsons use most of the milk from their Red Polls herd to make a historic and popular cheese called Colwick, which was invented in 1660 in the village of Colwick, Nottinghamshire.

But as the couple found they had lots of excess milk, they decided the perfect thing to do was introduce their vending machine, so nothing went to waste.

Mr Hewson said: 'We are happy for people to come and help themselves. Lots of younger people have been coming to sample our fresh milk which is great, as it's so nutritious.'
