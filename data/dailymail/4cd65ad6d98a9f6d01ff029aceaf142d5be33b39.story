An 80-year-old Korean War veteran who's reliant on a wheelchair and lost one of his legs in combat was attacked and robbed in his own Colorado home on Saturday.

Lee Pekish, who lives in Aurora on his military pension, last remembers walking his pug in the evening before things go blank.

The next thing he knows, its hours later and he's in a pool of his own blood. 

Shameful: 80-year-old Korean War veteran Lee Pekish who's reliant on a wheelchair was attacked and robbed in his own Colorado home on Saturday

Amnesia: Pekish lost one of his legs in combat. He'd been outside with his dog when his memory of last Satruday's events go blank

At first, Pekish feared he'd had a stroke.

'Blood is everywhere and I really didn't know what the heck had happened to me. It took me most of the night to figure out what had happened,' Pekish told CBS Denver.

He told KUSA:

'When I woke up both my cat and my dog were right beside me here. And they never left me.' 

He also soon discovered nearly $400 missing from his home. 

Pekish realized he'd been attacked when he discovered on his head a gash about the size and shape of the butt of a gun.

He'd fallen out of his wheelchair and was bleeding so profusely from a wound on his toes that he nearly lost three on the remaining leg. 

But the war-hardened vet refused to seek medical attention, at least at first.

Eventually his friend Sandy Nolan convinced him to get the police involved.

''I says, he's going to be cranky because he didn't want me to call you. So if he gets cranky I am going to stand behind you!'' she told the police.

Violent: Pekish at first thought he'd had a stroke when he awoke on the floor in a pool of blood--that, perhaps, he'd fallen out of his wheelchair because of the stroke and hurt himself--but soon found a gun butt shaped wound on his head

Drug addicts? Police suspect Pekish had gone back into the house and was facing his desk when an intruder bludgeoned him. Four hundred was missing from the home and police think the robber or robbers make also have been after drugs

Even when the officer showed up, Pekish said he didn't want medical attention. Thankfully, he relented and was taken by ambulance to the hospital where he received stitches.

Pekish theorizes that, after he walked his dog, he went back into the house and a thief took the opportunity to take advantage of a disabled old man.

He believes he was bludgeoned and that the intruder or intruders were interested not just in cash but also in stealing drugs. 

The proud retired arts professor told CBS Denver that,while he's terrified something like this could happen again, he's not sure there's anything that can be done about it.

'Where else would I go? I’m lucky to have a place this size at the rate I pay,' he said. 

This helplessness coming from an 80-year-old who bravely served his country infuriates Pekish's friends. And with so little evidence, police don't have much hope they'll nab the guilty party.

'I was just so angry and so upset that some lowlife amoeba would come in and attack a vereran of our foreign wars,' Nolan told CBS Denver.
