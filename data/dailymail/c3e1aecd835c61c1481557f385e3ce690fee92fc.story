Jack Wilshere revealed that England will watch the colossal Wembley showdown between Carl Froch and George Groves before jetting off to Miami, and that he is backing the ‘mouthy little Londoner’ to win.

The Arsenal midfielder believes Groves proved a lot of people wrong in the first fight between the pair and he backed the underdog to win this time.

England take on Peru in a World Cup warm-up on Friday before Wembley is transformed into a boxing ring, ready for Froch and Groves to do battle in front of 80,000 on Saturday.

Preparation: England face Peru at Wembley on Friday before flying to Miami for two more friendlies

Wilshere said: ‘Groves, last time, he shut a lot of people up. People thought he was just a mouthy little Londoner but he walked the walk as well. He has got a lot of respect from Froch this time.‘It will be an interesting fight but I’d have to say I probably go for Groves to win.’

After their friendly against Peru, England complete their World Cup preparations in Miami with games against Ecuador and Honduras.

Wilshere’s place in England’s starting line-up is far from certain, and he wants to use the next three games to cement his spot.

But the Arsenal midfielder doesn’t think it is a straight shootout with Jordan Henderson to partner captain Steven Gerrard in the centre of midfield.

‘There are a lot of good players in this squad, like Ross Barkley and Frank Lampard, so I wouldn’t like to think it is just between us two (him and Henderson),’ Wilshere said.

‘There are a lot of young players and experience. If you look at the young players like me and Barkley and Henderson – we will be looking for help. Gerrard is there, Lampard is there and they will always be looking to help us.

‘I am at the stage now where I just need a few games. I have been training for six weeks and am feeling good. I am just desperate to get out there now.’

Respect: Despite his controversial defeat, Wilshere says Groves earned a lot of respect from the first fight

England’s squad features a lot of young players, such as Barkley, Raheem Sterling, Adam Lallana and Luke Shaw, and Wilshere is pleased at the level of focus on developing the next generation.He said: ‘It is good – a lot of people have been calling for it for a long time. The likes of Germany do it and they have been successful and now we are doing it. 

‘I know they are young but they are good players. They have played in the Premier League 30 or 40 times this season and have done well. They have been the better players in their teams so we are looking forward to seeing what they can do as well.

‘I know they have got to prove themselves internationally but they are here on merit, they have got great talent and hopefully they can show that.’
