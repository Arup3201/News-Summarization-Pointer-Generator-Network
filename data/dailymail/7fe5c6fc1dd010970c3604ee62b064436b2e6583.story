One of Britain’s tallest Maypoles has been secretly cut down by a council ahead of the Tour de France following health and safety fears.

Experts had discovered the 75ft Otley Maypole was rotting during a risk assessment ahead of the cycling race, which passes through the town in West Yorkshire next weekend.

The examination was prompted after a forestry officer who was walking past the Maypole noticed that it was leaning at an angle - and decided to do a full assessment.

Stump: Council officials said that the situation was considered an emergency when extensive cubicle brown rot was found, so the structure had to be taken down

Council officials insisted that the situation was considered an emergency when extensive cubicle brown rot was found, so the structure had to be taken down.

But local Liberal Democrat councillor Colin Campbell said: ‘I am very concerned that Otley's iconic Maypole has been removed. It was the largest permanent Maypole in Yorkshire, if not the world.

‘I understand the decision to cut it down but I feel there could have been more public discussion as a number of residents have been quite upset about its loss.’

His colleague Ryk Downes, another Leeds City Council councillor, added: ‘To bring the Maypole down was the right call. However, to do it in this way, with no consultation or planning is a disgrace.

Felled: It is thought that a Maypole could have existed on the site in West Yorkshire as early as 1660

‘What would have been a tourist attraction, helping put Otley on the map and in the minds of tourists from around the world at the Grand Depart is now nothing more than a shaved stump.’

Ryk Downes, Leeds City Council

The Otley Maypole was one of two on Manchester Square in Otley.

A plaque on the green structure read: ‘A Maypole has stood on this site for many centuries. Present pole erected 1962’.

It is thought that a Maypole could have existed on the site as early as 1660. The larger Maypole was owned by Leeds City Council while the smaller is the property of Otley Town Council.

Cllr Ryk Downes said: ‘Now they dance around the smaller one - which is still standing - on Mayday and the huge one that was cut down was more of a monument.

‘Now we don't know when we will get a new maypole, but it won't be before the Tour de France, which is disappointing for the town. It is massive so it will take some time to source a new one.

‘Because of the massive size, when we do get one it is unlikely it will come in one piece. Also, when they took the other one down they took it apart in sections so it's not even lying anywhere whole.’

'It was unfortunate that this had to be treated as an emergency but the risks of not doing so far outweighed the alternative'

Mark Dobson, Leeds City Council

Cllr Mark Dobson, Leeds City Council’s executive member for the environment, said: ‘Extensive decay was detected at the base of the Maypole and that posed a serious risk to members of the public in what is a busy area of Otley.

‘It was simply not acceptable to put the public at risk by delaying action to deal with that situation.

'It was unfortunate that this had to be treated as an emergency but the risks of not doing so far outweighed the alternative.’

Two years ago Leeds City Council was fined £12,000 after two-year-old River Webster suffered serious injuries when a 16ft flagpole fell and hit her on the head in Otley Memorial Garden.
