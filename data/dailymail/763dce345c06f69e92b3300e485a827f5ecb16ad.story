A baby girl is defying the odds by surviving after being born on the legal abortion cut-off point.

Claire Cressey, 34, gave birth to Emily Grace on February 27 when she was just 24 weeks pregnant.

Believed to be one of Scotland's tiniest ever babies – born at the legal cut off for abortions - she is so small she could fit into the palm of a hand.

Emily Grace is one of Scotland's smallest ever babies after being born at 24 weeks weighing just 1lb 3oz

Emily– who was born the day before her mother’s birthday - weighed just 1lb 3oz.

She is so fragile that her parents have not yet been able to hold her.

Doctors at Edinburgh Royal Infirmary (ERI) are now working around the clock to save her.

Mother-of-four Ms Cressey said it was a feeling of ‘huge panic and devastation’ when she went into labour.

‘I didn't know what to think, having thought I would be having a nice birthday on the 28th,’ she said.

Ms Cressey was escorted by ambulance from her home in Coldstream, Scottish Borders to ERI so medical experts could attempt to save her baby.

After a four hour labour, Emily was born and was moved straight to neonatal intensive care.

‘When I first saw her, I was absolutely petrified,’ said Ms Cressey.

‘I was frightened to death of her, she was so tiny and they immediately put her in a little bag to keep her temperature from dropping.

A normal pregnancy involving just one baby is expected to last for 40 weeks.

It is legal to have an abortion in the UK during the first 24 weeks of pregnancy.

If a baby is born before 24 weeks, the birth is classed as a miscarriage because babies are normally only considered viable outside the womb from 24 weeks.

Some hospitals may attempt to save a baby born at 23 weeks but the chance of survival is lower.

‘I just cried when I saw her. You feel shock, horror, fear, it's your worst emotions coming true - everything you never want to feel.

‘Within an hour of her being born they took me to see her. She was still in the bag and hooked up to life support, it was really frightening.

‘She's so tiny it's unbelievable, even the pictures don't do it justice - she's the size of my hand.’

At three-days-old, Emily was able to breathe by herself and doctors put her on a lower dependency CPAP (continuous positive airway pressure) machine.

But ten days later, she started to struggle so doctors were forced to ventilate her again, a necessity not uncommon with babies born before 29 weeks.

‘We only got to touch her for the first time a week ago,’ Ms Cressey added.

‘It was our first mother-to-baby contact and was incredible to feel her tiny fingers.

‘She opened her eyes last week, which was a massive step for us.

‘It was a tremendous feeling, there's no words for it, but that just left me longing to hold her so badly.

‘She's so delicate, she can't come out at the moment, which is so difficult for us.’

Ms Cressey, and her partner, Alan Coultas, have praised the local community for supporting them during an incredibly stressful period.

Reverend David Taverner travelled to the hospital to baptise Emily after the couple's eldest daughter wrote him a letter asking him to pray for the tiny baby.

Bliss, the national charity for newborn babies said babies born early often have problems with breathing and gaining weight.

They can also be more prone to infections. If a premature baby's lungs are not fully developed, or the baby is very weak, it may be put on a ventilator.

A growing number of babies are being born prematurely and more of those who arrive very early are surviving.

Many premature babies have problems feeding and have to receive the nutrients and fluids they need to grow through tubes.

Recent research funded by the Medical Research Council pointed to a cut-off point in terms of chances of survival at 24 weeks - the current legal limit for abortion.
