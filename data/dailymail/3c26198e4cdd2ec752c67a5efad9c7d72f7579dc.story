Harry Redknapp has told Shaun Wright Phillips to leave QPR and continue his career elsewhere – but says the midfielder is not prepared to take a pay-cut.

Wright Phillips, who earns in the region of £60,000-per-week, has played just 78 minutes for QPR this season in the Capital One Cup and has not started a league game since September 2013.

And the 33-year-old, who is out of contract in the summer, says it is ‘burning him up’ not knowing why he is not playing and claims when he went to see Redknapp to ask why, the discussion became heated and turned into a row.

 But Redknapp said: ‘Shaun knows I have asked him to go on loan. But he is not going to go when he has a great deal here.

‘I can’t understand why someone does not want to play. We all get upset with people’s attitudes, but he is not going to move.

‘It’s not the player’s fault. It is the person who gave him the contract, it’s their fault’

Blackburn, Bolton and Charlton have all shown interest in signing the player that Chelsea paid Manchester City £21million for in 2005 – only for the player to turn them all down.

Redknapp also confirmed QPR would let Wright Phillips leave permanently on a free transfer – but says there has been no interest from anyone in the Premier League and Championship clubs would not be able to match his current wages.

Redknapp added: ‘It is very difficult when you earn that much money to go and play anywhere else.

‘When you are earning x amount of pounds and somebody wants to pay you a fraction of that, you are not going to move.

‘Now shifting him when he is not in your plans is difficult.’

Wright Phillips is highly unlikely to feature for QPR in today’s game with Manchester United at Loftus Road. And despite pressure mounting on Redknapp with his side in the bottom three, he does not feel the extra burden.

He added: ‘Pressure is all self-inflicted. It’s the pride of wanting to do well, that’s what keeps us all going. None of us want to do badly, we all want to win.

‘I love my chairman Tony Fernandes, but if he says to me ‘Harry, we are going to go down a different route’ then fine, it’s his choice. What can I do?

‘You do your best. That’s all I can do.’

Redknapp is not worried about his QPR job ahead of the visit of Manchester United on Saturday
