Forget Johnny Knoxville, one young prankster has become a social media sensation after filming herself playing Jackass-style jokes - on her own mother.

Kelly Mai Webb, 22, secretly uses her mobile phone to capture herself pelting her mother Jackie Webb, 52, with eggs and hot dogs before posting her videos on Facebook.

In one incident, Kelly recreated any mother's worst nightmare by poring sugar in a plastic bag and falsely claimed to a horrified Jackie she was a cocaine dealer - before admitting she had made it up.

Kelly Mai Webb has become a hit om social networks after filming herself pranking her mum Jackie Webb

The collection of videos of long-suffering Jackie being pranked - usually as she innocently watches TV on the sofa - have become a smash hit on social media site with more than 250,000 hits.

And Kelly who lives in Blackpool has even been recognised in the street by fans of her films - with one woman even asked if she could have a selfie taken with her.

Kelly, a healthcare assistant who has a young sister aged ten called Libby, says that she loves the light-hearted nature of the videos and saw a gap in the market to start her own. 

Kelly has previously thrown eggs, hotdogs and trifle at her mother usually while she is relaxing on the sofa

Jackie says that Kelly has been a hand-full from a young age and was always getting in trouble at school

'I just love watching pranks online because they always make me laugh. One evening I was sitting watching funny YouTube videos when I realised there are no female pranksters.

'It's always the blokes like Johnny Knoxville and Dom Joly getting all the limelight and making people laugh so I thought why not? 

'I started filming myself doing pranks and uploading them on my Facebook page and within weeks I was getting thousands of views.'

Kelly, who doesn't live with her mum but visits four times a week, admits that some of her previous tricks have been a bit harsh. 

Kelly captures all of her videos on her mobile and uploads them to her Facebook page 

'Some of the pranks I do are a bit mean, and people do tell me they are disgusted in me but I make them laugh.

'The worst one I ever did was when I put sugar in a plastic bag and told my mum I was dealing cocaine. 

'She was so upset that I thought she was going to call the police so I had to tell her I was joking. I also threw hotdogs at mum whilst she was sitting watching a Bushtucker trial in I'm a Celebrity Get Me Out of Here.

'My mum does get annoyed with me pulling pranks on her. My personality is outrageous and I know that, but I just love making people laugh.'

Kelly says that although her mum doesn't always find her jokes funny she has had plenty of praise from everyone else.  

Kelly was inspired to start filming her tricks after she realised there were very few female pranksters 

'I was on a night out in Blackpool and these Norwegian guys came over and said they had seen my videos, and a couple of weeks ago I was going through a McDonald's drive-through in Preston and a woman noticed me and asked if she could have a selfie with me. 

'She said she loved my videos and that my mum made her laugh. It was so good to know I'm making people smile with my pranks.

'I would love my own TV show where I could go round pulling pranks on people.'

Jackie who works as an admin assistant says that Kelly has been mischievous from a young age. 

Kelly's videos have become so popular that she has even been recognised in the street

'Kelly is a handful. She has always been a nutcase. I've got all of her reports from when she was at school and she was always getting in trouble, not for anything really bad, just for silly things.

'Kelly's dad and I would sometimes sit on the sofa and try and work out what is wrong with her. She never gave us a minute's peace. She's got worse as she's got older. I've never met anybody like her.

'She never shuts up and she is always winding me up. I love her to pieces but she's so annoying. It would be nice if she just came round to see me, but every time she comes round she has to do something silly like these video pranks. Sometimes I dread her coming round because I just don't know what tricks she's got up her sleeve.'

Jackie added that no matter how many pranks Kelly plays on her she still believes everything her daughter says.  

'The awful thing is that I believe everything she says - she's like The Boy Who Cried Wolf. It will probably get to the point where I will have to ban her from coming to the house.

'When Kelly pranks me I get really annoyed and upset. Sometimes I do feel fed up, but a couple of days after Kelly shows me the videos and I do see the funny side and we have a laugh together.'

Jackie says that although Kelly receives plenty of compliments for her videos online not everyone agrees that she is funny.  

'Kelly tells me she gets all these comments and things on Facebook but I don't use social media so I don't know what people are saying. 

'She says people find the videos hilarious, but a few of my friends think she's disgusting. They say "how can you let her humiliate you like that?"

'My younger daughter Libby is only ten but she's more grown up than Kelly. She's quiet, she's the absolute opposite of her and she's always telling Kelly to grow up. She says "She's pathetic, Mum, just ignore her."

'I have been in the shops a few times when I have seen people looking at me, and a couple of people have said "Are you Kelly's mum? We've seen you in her videos." I can't believe I am being recognised for these silly pranks.'
