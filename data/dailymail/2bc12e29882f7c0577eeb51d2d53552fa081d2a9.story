A collection of impressive jewels worn by the Italian actress Gina Lollobrigida at the height of her fame smashed all estimates as it went under the hammer last night.

Twenty three of the star's Bulgari gems, worn at landmark moments during her career, were sold at Sotheby's Geneva as part of the auction house's Magnificent Jewels and Noble Jewels sale.

The biggest draw of the night was a pair of stunning diamond and pearl earrings from 1964, which broke the previous world record for a pair of pearl pendants when they sold to an anonymous bidder for an astonishing £1,567,771 ($2,391,321).

The pearl earrings sold for more than five times their estimate as they went under the hammer last night

their estimate of  £400,000 ($600,000), netting nearly £1.6m when they 
were sold to an anonymous bidder

Firm favourite: The actress was particularly fond of the pearl drop earrings, wearing them dozens of times over the years

The jewels, which were highlights of the international touring exhibition Bulgari –
 125 Years of Italian Magnificence, also included a 
Bulgari cushion-shaped diamond ring weighing 19.03 carats from 1962 and a diamond 
necklace/bracelet from 1954.

Speaking after the sale, Gina 
Lollobrigida said: 'Jewels are meant to give pleasure and for many years
 I had enormous pleasure wearing mine.

'Many people tried to persuade me to 
sell them, but for a very long time I was unwilling. What changed was 
seeing a little girl called Sofia suffering from a disorder which could 
only be helped by stem cell treatment – treatment which she is unable to
 receive in Italy.

'Selling my jewels to help raise 
awareness of stem cell therapy, which can cure so many illnesses, seems 
to me a wonderful use to which to put them.

'It is my hope that the Italian 
parliament will approve this ground-breaking treatment, so that children
 and adults in Italy should have free access to it without having to 
travel abroad at great expense.

'It now gives me great pleasure to see
 that these jewels will create a legacy which will live on after me and 
continue to do good.'

David Bennett of Sotheby's said: 
'Every so often a very special jewel collection comes along which is so 
much more than the sum of its parts.

'Gina Lollobrigida’s magnificent 
jewels captured the public imagination around the world and the prices 
achieved this evening reflect not only the importance and rarity of 
those pieces, but also the aura of fascination which this legendary 
actress continues to exert.

'Sotheby’s was honoured to be 
entrusted with the sale and we are delighted that the results will 
contribute to the noble cause of stem cell research, reflecting Miss 
Lollobrigida’s great generosity of spirit and her humanitarian work.'

Sparkling
 form: The Italian actress, here dressed to impress on a glamorous 
evening in Monaco in 2001, adored jewellery and had an extensive 
collection of gems. The emerald earrings and brooch she wears here were sold last night

The actress, known fondly in her heyday as La Lollo, was a great collector of fine jewellery. Some she bought for herself, some she was gifted by admirers - of which there were many.

In an interview with Sotheby's magazine she said she adored the craftsmanship of each piece.

'I love the stones – the pearls and emeralds – because they are natural, the raw products of nature.

'Then there is the skill of the artist involved, the craftsmanship of turning these beautiful stones into works of art. Each one is like a sculpture.'

Lollobrigida, who came from humble beginnings, rose to fame in the Fifties and Sixties and was one of the most popular actresses of the time, starring alongside Anthony Quinn n The Hunchback Of Notre Dame and Frank Sinatra in Never So Few.

A contemporary of Marilyn Monroe, when the two actresses were introduced in the U.S., Monroe confessed that she was often referred to as 'the American Lollobrigida'.

Today the multitalented actress, now 85, is a photojournalist and sculptor working out of her studio near Carrara, Italy.

Passion: Lollobrigida, again in the £635,000 ($1m) pearls, collected fine jewellery, saying she loved the 'craftsmanship' and detail of the pieces

The Magnificent Jewels sale also saw other important diamonds go under the hammer, including an 
internally flawless cushion-shaped diamond weighing 27.90 carats, a rare Kashmir sapphire ring weighing 11.71 carats 
and an impressive sapphire and diamond pendant-brooch weighing 43.27 
carats.

The Noble Jewels section featured a cushion-shaped Fancy 
Yellow diamond jewel, weighing nearly 75 carats, formerly in the private
 collection of His Late Imperial Majesty Sultan Ahmad Shah Qajar (b.1898
 - d.1930), together with an important pink diamond and diamond necklace
 set with a light pink brilliant-cut diamond weighing 6.93 carats and a 
circular-cut diamond weighing 34.78 carats.

Also featured was a 1965 Bulgari gem set 
and diamond necklace from a European Royal family.
