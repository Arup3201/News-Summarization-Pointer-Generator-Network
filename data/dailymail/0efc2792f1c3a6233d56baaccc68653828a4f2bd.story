Special needs: Walter Bartolomucci, who is 28 but has the mental age of a nine-year-old, was held in jail for a week without any word to his parents

A disabled man with the mental age of a nine-year-old was jailed for nearly a week without his medication and with no word to his parents.

Walter Bartolomucci, 28, who is rarely apart from his mother, was held at Bergen County Jail in New Jersey where, his parents say, he suffered panic attacks.

There was no attempt to contact his worried parents - still his legal guardians - who only eventually learned of their son's whereabouts from a family friend.

But that was not the end of Bartolomucci's ordeal. Facing charges of robbery and assault, he was held in a cell for six days because his family were unable to stump up the $50,000 bail.

Bartolomucci says his disabilities made him a target of some warders. 'Some of the guards know about my special needs, some of the guards treat me mean,' he said.

Those charges - and the massive bail requirement - were subsequently dropped and Bartolomucci was eventually released from jail on Tuesday. His parents are furious at the treatment he received.

'You have to tell Walter to do everything,' said his mother, Joanie Bartolomucci. 'That's why we have to tell him every day: you have to take your shower, you have to brush your teeth.'

Bartolomucci was arrested on September 11 at a Pathmark outlet in Bergenfield, where he had been taken by his cousin while Mrs Bartolomucci was in hospital undergoing surgery, her husband by her side.

Police told NBC News that that the cousin had egged on Bartolomucci to put some VHS tapes in his bag and steal them. When he was caught, he allegedly swung the bag at a Pathmark worker who tried to stop him.

He was arrested on charges of robbery and assault.

'As soon as he starts talking to you, you can tell': Bartolomucci with his outraged mother Joanie, whose side he rarely leaves but who was in hospital undergoing an operation on the day that he was arrested

Bartolomucci, whose disability is evident from his stutter and physical appearance, told NBC how he cried in the police car as he was taken away.

His mother said: 'They could clearly see, when they arrested him, that he was special. And I'm sure the girl, the manager, could clearly see that he was special.

'As soon as he starts talking to you, you can tell.'

Nevertheless, Bergenfield police judged that Bartolomucci was mentally sound enough to be jailed. His parents, meanwhile, had no idea where their son was.

'We were never notified as his parents and his guardians, we were never notified of anything,' said Mrs Bartolomucci.

Bartolomucci was finally released on Tuesday with no explanation, his bail requirements dropped. His lawyer told NBC that prosecutors had dropped the robbery and assault charges after a review.

He still faces a disorderly person charge.
