He managed to push the youngster back out onto the beach, but a large waved forced him underwater.

A short time later he was spotted face down in the water, was too far from the shoreline for any bystanders to attempt a rescue, according to the Eureka Times Standard.  

The Shelter Cove Volunteer Fire Department responded and recovered Bierle from the ocean. Resuscitation attempts were unsuccessful, and he died at the scene.

His sister-in-law Sarah Bierle, shared a Facebook post written by Steve's wife Sandy.

She thanked friends and family for the 'outpouring of love'. 

Penning the tribute from the hotel where they were staying, she said her 'partner and love' died during an accident where he saved his son's life 'but lost his own'.

Mrs Bierle owned rafting firm Flying Pig Adventure Company, which offered trips to Yellowstone Park. 

Shelter Cover is in a remote area of redwoods and towering mountains referred to as the Lost Coast. 

A statement from the Humboldt County Sheriffs Office read: 'A family on vacation from Gardiner, Montana, was at the beach when a thirteen year old family member slipped on a rock and fell into the ocean. 

'The boy’s father went into the water and was able to push his son out of the water and back onto the beach. Before the father could exit the water, a large wave came in and forced him under water and out of sight.

'A short while later the body was seen face down in the water but too far out for any of the witnesses to attempt a rescue.

'The Shelter Cove Volunteer Fire Department responded to the scene and was able to recover the body out of the water. Resuscitation attempts were made but the subject was eventually declared deceased at the scene.

'The deceased subject has been identified as Steven Arthur Bierle, age 44, from Gardiner, Montana.'
