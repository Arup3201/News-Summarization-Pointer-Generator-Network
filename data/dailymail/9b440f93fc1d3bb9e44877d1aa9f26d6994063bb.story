For Dundee United and Celtic, the trilogy becomes a quadrilogy. Already facing each other three times in three competitions at three different venues across the third month of the year, one final blast of beleaguered referee Craig Thomson’s whistle at Tannadice ensured yet another instalment of this saga.

In the movie business, each successive film in a franchise tends to be markedly poorer than its predecessor. And as the dust settled on this breathtaking and at times bewildering contest of almost incessant controversy, the suspicion lingered that nothing that lies ahead in March could possibly match this blockbuster for drama, action and utter high farce.

For on an astonishing Scottish Cup afternoon on Tayside, nine-man United fought to a valiant 1-1 draw against their 10-man visitors. This was a game scarred by two early red cards, ultimately three in total, but, in truth, there could have been five. One, dished out to the luckless Paul Paton, was a monumentally unjust case of mistaken identity.

Adding to the scandal, Nadir Ciftci, the United striker who opened the scoring from the spot after team-mate Aidan Connolly appeared to dive to win a penalty, should not have been on the park at all after kicking out at Scott Brown.

The Celtic captain was, himself, lucky to escape red for a quite awful challenge on the Turkish forward in the first place.

And even after all that drama there was still room to plot in a villain-to-hero story, as Leigh Griffiths missed a penalty then scored an equaliser to break the heart of outstanding United keeper Rado Cierzniak. Griffiths’ beautiful header secured a replay at Parkhead on March 18 – the second of three games in a week between the teams – although the Celtic striker may now relinquish penalty duties.

‘I had the chance to get us back in it with the penalty but he saved it,’ said Griffiths. ‘I’d been practising in training all day yesterday [Saturday] and never missed a single one. I apologised to the fans because I never scored. It was my fault and if Kris Commons is back in the team next week he will be back on them because he’s No1 penalty taker. But if not I will put my hand up to take one because I am always confident.

‘Their goalie’s had one of those games, he saved everything we threw at him. I hope he’s not in that form in the final next week or we could be in trouble. But it was nice that I picked myself up to score.'

The tone for a bizarre afternoon was set on nine minutes when Brown went in hard on Ciftci. He retaliated with a kick towards the Celtic skipper’s head. In the same melee, Calum Butcher slid into Virgil van Dijk, who appeared to stamp down on the United man as the pair tangled on the ground.

And yet, after a three-minute discussion between referee Thomson and his assistant Graham Chambers, red cards were issued to van Dijk and, astonishingly, the apparently blameless Paton instead of Butcher.

As he trudged off, Paton’s face was the picture of incredulity. This season he has already been banned for two games for allegedly spitting at Aberdeen’s Johnny Hayes – despite his ‘victim’ protesting that Paton was innocent.

Paton recently insisted he was the victim of unfair treatment from the SFA because he elected to play for Northern Ireland over Scotland. That, of course, remains a nonsense but he was right to feel aggrieved.

As half-time approached, United nearly took the lead when Butcher’s mis-hit shot was diverted past Craig Gordon by Ryan Dow but the ball bounced back off the inside of the post and was hacked away to safety.

Then, after a lighting break, Celtic raced up to the other end and great play from Stefan Johansen saw him cleverly slip the ball in for Anthony Stokes. The forward was clean through on goal, and took two touches before picking his spot.

Unfortunately for him, however, the spot he chose was the bottom left post and the ball was cleared by United’s relieved defence. Whether or not the ball took a bobble on the pitch, only Stokes will know, but it looked a real sitter.

Worse was to come for the Irishman when young Connolly drove at the Celtic defence and appeared to throw himself to the ground with Stokes nearby.

It looked a dive but Ciftci didn’t care about that as he ruthlessly cracked his spot kick low and hard beyond the diving Gordon.

As the teams left the park at half-time Emilio Izaguirre was furious at the award of the spot kick. But it was the Honduran’s misplaced clearance into the path of Connolly that had put his team under pressure in the first place.

It was a crazy conclusion to the first half but the second period immediately brought fresh madness. Within three minutes, Dundee United were down to nine men when Griffiths’ shot struck Paul Dixon on the arm as the United defender attempted to block.

Griffiths caught the ball well but United goalkeeper Cierzniak, so often criticised, pulled off a wonderful save to prevent Celtic levelling. With United moving to a 5-3-0 formation, it was like the Alamo at times but there were great saves to come from Cierzniak - from both Stokes and substitute John Guidetti.

Despite the one-way traffic, however, Gordon had to look lively to stop Butcher scoring on a rare United counter.

Just as it looked like Celtic’s treble dreams could come unstuck on an unacceptably poor Tannadice pitch, Griffiths gained his redemption. Running on to Stefan Johansen’s beautifully-flighted ball, he nodded expertly beyond Cierzniak.

From then on in, United nine men battled valiantly to remain in the hunt for a semi-final spot.

‘It will be a tough game at Hampden against Inverness or Raith,’ nodded Griffiths after the draw was made. ‘Either side will make it hard for us - but that’s only if we get through by finishing the job at Parkhead. But we know Dundee United will make it tough for us.’

At the end of a quite thrilling encounter, United had sent out a clear message ahead of the sequel, next Sunday’s League Cup final at Hampden. Beware the Ides of March.
