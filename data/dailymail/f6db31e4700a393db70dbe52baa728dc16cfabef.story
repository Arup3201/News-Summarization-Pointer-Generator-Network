Health inspectors discovered 11 rats on an airliner after it arrived in China from Hong Kong, underneath a business class seat.

The find, at Xiamen Gaoqi International Airport in Fujian Province on September 30, is believed to be the largest number of rats ever discovered aboard an airliner.

Video shows inspectors wearing protective suits and masks boarding the plane and searching through overhead lockers and behind seats.

They then discovered a rat nest underneath one of the seats in the business class section containing what they described as 10 'suckling rat pups'.

The mother rat was caught the following day.

The aircraft's cabin was immediately closed while the airport launched a public health emergency plan.

Luckily tests showed no viruses had been left behind by the animals. The plane was later given the all-clear after confirming its wiring was intact.
