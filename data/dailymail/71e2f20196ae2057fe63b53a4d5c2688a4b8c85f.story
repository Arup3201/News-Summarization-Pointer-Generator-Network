A talented dog is her owner’s best friend – because she helps cook, clean and tend the garden for her owner.

Chloe, a Newfoundland dog, also lends her paws to the shopping and recycling for her 75-year-old owner Hazel Carter, who has a muscle condition which means she struggles to do things herself.

The four-year-old dog fetches food from the pantry, puts waste in the bin and even loads the washing machine with clothes and detergent.

Chloe the Newfoundland dog helps take her owner Hazel Carter's socks off. The 75-year-old has a debilitating muscle condition so she taught her pet how to help her out

Newfoundland Chloe lends a paw to her 75-year-old owner by fetching the dustpan and brush

She carries shopping bags in town, switches the vacuum on and packs her toys away to make life easier for her owner.

Mrs Carter, from Blackboys, near Uckfield, East Sussex, said: ‘She just knows what I need and when, without me telling her.’

Incredibly, Mrs Carter taught the dog everything herself.

She said: ‘She was taught using positive rewards, praise, treats and fuss. Many tasks are done with no commands from me at all.

‘She has a wonderful temperament. She is my 11 stone gentle giant.’
