A registered sex offender was found Saturday naked in bed with a 14-year-old girl by authorities looking for stolen property.

Craig Good, 29, of Ashland, MA., and the young girl were found in bed together when cops came armed with a search warrant to look for recently-stolen property. The girl told police it wasn’t the first time they’d had sex after meeting online.

The discovery was made on Good’s birthday, according to the Boston Globe.

Pervert: Craig Good, already a registered sex offender, was caught in bed with a 14-year-old girl on his birthday August 3

Good had met the girl a few weeks earlier and had sex with her a handful of times, according to officials. The pervert had previously been arrested July 14 and accused of a series of storage unit robberies, cops were at his residence searching for the stolen property, according to MetroWest Daily News.

After being let in by the alleged thief’s mother, investigators made their way to his room.

“I opened the door and observed Craig and what appeared to be a very young girl getting out of his bed,” Ashland police wrote in a police report quoted by the Boston Herald. “Both of them were completely naked and hurrying to put clothes on.’

After initially telling authorities she was 16 – the age of consent in Massachusetts – she revealed she was 14. Police notified the girl’s mother and sent her to a local hospital for an exam and ‘evidence collection,’ the Herald reported.

The stolen items were found in the home’s garage, according to reports. No further details on the items were made available and Ashland police could not be reached by MailOnline for comment.

Good was booked on two charges of aggravated rape, two counts of abuse of a child and one count of receiving stolen property over $250, according to the Globe. He pleaded not guilty during a Saturday and is being held without bail.  In 60 days, bail will be set at $250,000 – he will only be released into house arrest with GPS monitoring, be forbidden to use the internet, not be allowed to make contact with the victim and not be allowed unsupervised contact with children under 16, the Globe noted.

Classified as a Level 3 sex offender, Good has ‘been determined to be at a high risk to reoffend and to pose a high degree of dangerousness to the public,’ according to the Massachusetts sex offender database.

His previous conviction stemmed from an October 2007 online sex sting during which a cop posed online as a 13-year-old girl, according to the Herald. The two had a graphic chat and agreed to meet at a coffee shop, Good served two and a half years in prison, according to WCVB.
