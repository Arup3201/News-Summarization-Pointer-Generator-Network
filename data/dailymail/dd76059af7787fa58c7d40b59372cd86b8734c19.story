A former county cricket chairman has described the combined county debt, which has approached £200million by his reckoning, as a ‘national disaster for the game’.

Neil Davidson, who owns The Cricketer magazine and used to run Leicestershire, has researched the vast monies owed for a financial state-of-the-game report for his magazine.

He discovered that the sums owed by the 18 counties had risen from £100m in 2008 to £191m four years later. Davidson believes that building or refurbishing grounds to gain or keep international matches is responsible for the deficit.

Grounds for complaint: The cost of refurbishing grounds has left county cricket around £150m in debt

In the Red: County cricket's debt is still less than the cost of a new stand at Anfield

However ECB chief operating officer Gordon Hollins dismisses Davidson ‘as not really understanding’ the strategy, insisting new facilities will greatly improve counties earning power.

Hollins adds that the debt — now around  £150m — is less than the cost of a new football stand at Liverpool’s Anfield and ECB have invested more in county grounds over the last five years than ever...............................................................................

The ECB have carved out a lucrative role for Andy Flower at their Loughborough Academy. At the same time, England Under 19 and Under 17 support staff are being asked to re-apply for their jobs as part of a revamp aimed at ensuring that Loughborough enhances, rather than replicates, what happens at county level................................................................................

Contrary commentator Alan Green was absent from an FA party in Miami before the World Cup, where a presentation was made to mark his BBC radio colleague Mike Ingham’s imminent retirement.

Green  was said to want to reserve his tribute until he hands over the mic to Ingham for the last time tomorrow. Hopefully he does so in a fitting way..........................................................................................................

Some of  world cricket’s greatest names — and former journeyman bowler Simon Hughes — gathered in Nottingham curry house Mem-Saab to celebrate Sunil Gavaskar’s 65th birthday.

The line-up included Geoff Boycott, Mike Proctor, Kapil Dev, Michael Vaughan, Ian Botham and Wasim Akram. Gavaskar picked up the tab, subsidised by Mem-Saab...........................................................................................................

It has emerged that referee grandee David Elleray escaped FA punishment following  a complaint about his language even before his appalling racist comment — ‘You looked rather tanned, have you been down a coal mine?’ — to a black FA employee at a St George’s Park  referees’ summit resulted in only a rap over  the knuckles.

Foot in mouth disease: Former referee David Elleray has escaped making some outlandish comments

Former Premier League referee Mark Halsey made an official protest to the FA last January  after he heard Elleray had described him as  a ‘b*****d’ at a Bury and Bolton refs association meeting. FA legal director Alistair Maclean, who also dealt leniently with the racist issue, took no action because Halsey was not  prepared to say who told him about Elleray’s comment..........................................................................................................

The ICC have drawn a veil over the internal disciplinary investigation into behaviour by YP Singh, head of their anti-corruption and security unit, at a gala dinner in Melbourne.

Complaints were made about an inebriated Singh making inappropriate sexual advances to the wife of a high-ranking cricket official. ICC’s ineffective chief executive David Richardson will be under scrutiny to see that the embarrassing incident is not swept under the Dubai carpet.

England discard Kevin Pietersen suggested in his national newspaper column that spinner Monty Panesar should be brought back into the  Test team — seemingly unaware of Monty’s  current problems on and off the pitch.

'Unselectable': Kevin Pietersen's call for Monty Panesar to be selected for England wasn't well thought out

Panesar, described as ‘unselectable’ by England head coach Peter Moores, has been dropped by Essex for poor form and for turning up late for a team meeting having been at the Groves-Froch fight the night before.

Adam Parker, a former FIFA marketing executive and current chief executive of Commonwealth Games England, is to take over as CEO of the Amateur Swimming Association after the Glasgow Games. David Sparkes, who was in charge of both amateur and elite sides, will now concentrate on British Swimming.
