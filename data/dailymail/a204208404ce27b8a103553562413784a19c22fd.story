A businessman who built his own £325,000 toll road to bypass roadworks has said a lack of support from the council means he will not break even.

Mike Watts claimed Bath and North East Somerset's reluctance to  install signs and grant planning permission will hurt him financially and result in motorists travelling miles out of their way.

The 62-year-old became fed up of a 14-mile detour caused by roadworks after just a few hundred metres of highway were cordoned off due to a landslip.

Mike Watts, 62, said the council's reluctance over installing signs to highlight his £325,000 private toll road means he will not be able to break even

So Mr Watts rented an empty field next to the popular A431 between Bristol and Bath and spent more than £325,000 to build his own road which he has charged people £2 a go to use since August.

In doing this he became the first private individual to build a British toll road in more than a century.

He needs 150,000 cars to use the road before Christmas and is already ahead of schedule after recouping two thirds of his risky investment.

But, despite more than 125,000 vehicles driving across the toll road he has now said a lack of support from the council means he will not break even.

He said he was 'at a loss to understand' why the local authority had not given the support he feels he has needed.

'There are more signs up now saying 'road closed' than before we opened the toll road,' Mike said.

The toll road in Kelston, Somerset, which charges £2 for each car has attracted more than 125,000 vehicles

'We have been promised that they would look at the signage.

'Signage on the highways is detrimental to the public gaining access to the toll road.

'We still need not far short of 50,000 [vehicles] in order to break even,' he said.

'It is now a race against time. We were never driven to try and make a quick buck.

'In fact if anyone wanted to make a quick buck I would advise them not to build a toll road.'

His planning application for the temporary road was submitted in August costing Mike around £25,000.

'Right up till today there have been constant objections from highways,' he said.

'There have been objections on the website regarding archaeology - where have they dug that up from at this late stage?'

The application was due to be considered on Wednesday, but Mike said, in view of the latest objection, he would now need more time to prepare.

Toll road cost £150,000 to build and has with running costs of £150,000, plus £25,000 for a planning application 

A Bath and North East Somerset council spokeswoman said: 'The road is a private road and not designed to any highway standards.

'The Highway Authority has never been approached with a view to formal adoption of the road and in the absence of any formal consents it is not recognised as a public road.

'This is reinforced by Toll Road which has disclaimer signs informing motorists use the road at their own risk.

'The Council has made a considerable effort to work with Mr Watts and officers and Members have met with him several times. 

'We have no obligation to allow his signs on the public highway but have done so; we have also provided expertise, advice and our ground investigation results free of charge.

'The road signs relate to the closure of the road and not the toll road. They are rightly placed on the road rather than on the pavement where they would force pedestrians into the road near a traffic junction and school.

'The Council has been very accommodating with regards the toll road signs and offered to amend this layout and include toll road signage. 

'We offered Mr Watts the use of electronic signs (at his cost) and also for his traffic consultant to be involved in designing signage. Neither offer has been taken up.

He became the first private individual to build a British toll road in more than a century in August this year

'We are now nearing being able to determine the application and will seek to do so as soon as possible after considering all the representations received.

'This road is open to the public and has to comply with the normal safety standards. 

'To be able to consider this retrospective planning application, we have had to ask the applicant for further details about the construction of the road, including visibility standards and road stability - but we have not delayed the application without good reason.

'The Council has no intention of forcibly closing the toll road.' 

Despite the fact that the council does not recognise the toll road as an official road and a planning application has yet to be dealt with, Mike said he had received a bill for business rates. 

His toll road cost £150,000 to build, with running costs of £150,000.
