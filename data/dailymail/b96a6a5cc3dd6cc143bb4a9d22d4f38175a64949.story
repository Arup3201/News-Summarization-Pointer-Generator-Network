Tributes are pouring in for former Liberal prime minister Malcolm Fraser, the giant of Australian politics who died aged 84 on Friday morning. 

His office issued a statement confirming the news 'with deep sadness', saying he had suffered only a 'brief illness'. 

'We appreciate that this will be a shock to all who knew and loved him, but ask that the family be left in peace at this difficult time,' it said.

Mr Fraser was prime minister from November 1975 until March 1983.

He controversially came to power as caretaker prime minister following the dismissal of Labor leader Gough Whitlam by Governor-General Sir John Kerr.

Mr Fraser's party had blocked the supply of money for the government in the Senate, forcing the constitutional crisis. 

Gough Whitlam would dub Fraser 'Kerr's cur', although, perhaps in a sign of Mr Fraser's compassion, the two would have a rapprochement later in life.

Under his leadership, the Coalition then won the largest landslide of any political party at the 1975 federal election.

Prime Minister Tony Abbott today hailed Mr Fraser's service, acknowledging him and Mr Whitlam as 'fierce Australian patriots'. 

'Malcolm Fraser held true to the belief that his actions were in the best interests of Australia... He was rightly proud of his government.'

In office, Mr Fraser championed a multicultural Australia, delivered self-government to the Northern Territory and established SBS and the Australian Federal Police. 

He was determined in confronting the 'evil' of apartheid in South Africa and began to develop economic reforms that would change the country. 

Following his defeat by Labor's Bob Hawke in 1983, Mr Fraser became known as an outspoken advocate of asylum seekers.

He became critical of the Liberal Party - later resigning his membership - and his opinions, often broadcast on Twitter in his later years, tended to run against the grain of the modern party. 

Treasurer Joe Hockey told reporters: 'He supplied stability and re-assurance at a time where Australia had experienced much upheaval.

'I think history will be kinder to Malcolm Fraser than many of his critics have over the years.

Former Labor prime minister Kevin Rudd honoured Mr Fraser as a Liberal leader in the tradition of Alfred Deakin, the country's second leader. 

'All Australians will recall Mr Fraser’s role in the controversy surrounding the dismissal in 1975,' he added. 'This cannot be erased from history. 

'Prime Minister Fraser will be remembered as a compassionate Australian, who cared for people at home or abroad, who had little or nothing to protect them.

Greens Senator Sarah Hanson-Young said: 'Mr Fraser a politician of principle and leader of compassion. A true gentleman with a heart full of empathy. I am devastated.'

He is survived by his wife, Tamie, and their four children.

Malcolm Fraser was first elected to federal Parliament for his seat of Wannon when he was just 25

Our country has lost its 22nd Prime Minister, the Right Honourable Malcolm Fraser.

As our nation’s leader between 1975 and 1983, he restored economically responsible government while recognising social change.

In a long and active retirement, he maintained a keen interest in our country’s direction. 

The constitutional crisis of 1975 was one of the defining political events of our nation.

Malcolm Fraser held true to the belief that his actions were in the best interests of Australia. He was determined to ‘turn on the lights’ and restore Australia’s economic fortunes.

The greatest win in Australian political history confirms that he had correctly read the mood of the public.

The friendship he built in later life with Gough Whitlam spoke volumes about the character of both men at the centre of the crisis: in their own different ways, they were both fierce Australian patriots.

Under Malcolm Fraser’s leadership, self-government was conferred on the Northern Territory, the Commonwealth Ombudsman was established and our first Freedom of Information laws were enacted.

Following the Hilton bombing, he established the Australian Federal Police. Later, he introduced legislation to establish a crimes commission following the Costigan Royal Commission.

He commissioned the Campbell Report of 1981 which laid the foundations for eventual deregulation of the financial system.

Under Malcolm Fraser’s leadership, Australia was an unwavering opponent of apartheid and after he left office, Malcolm Fraser continued to work for the end of apartheid. His subsequent appointment to roles with the United Nations and the Commonwealth of Nations reflected his high international standing.

He had a deep interest in the advancement of indigenous people.

He banned sand mining on Fraser Island. As well, the first Australian sites were placed on the World Heritage List and the Great Barrier Reef Marine Park was declared.

He welcomed the re-settlement of tens of thousands of Vietnamese people in Australia who have subsequently added a rich, new dimension to our national life.

He was rightly proud of his government. As he said when he conceded defeat: Australia is handed over… in as good a condition or better condition than any other Western country in the world.
