Germans are marking 25 years since the fall of the Berlin Wall, but it seems some can't resist reliving the 'bad old days' of Communism.

Deep in the forests of former East Germany they are spending the night in an authentic Stasi bunker - complete with military uniforms, rations and formal training for a Cold War chemical attack.

Teenagers not yet born when the wall fell are among those signing up for the 14-hour tour at the Bunkermuseum Frauenwald, a 38,750 sq ft underground complex which once had enough supplies to last 130 occupants up to a year.

Nostalgia for the East: At 15 years old, Jesset Kogel (pictured) was not yet born when the Berlin Wall fell in 1989 - but he is now one of a growing number of people spending the night as soldiers in a Stasi-built Cold War bunker hidden in the woods near the city of Suhl

Listening in: A night in the bunker, which had a radio transmitter to reach the outside world, costs punters £87 including their rations

Shrine: The Stasi re-enactors brush up on the news of the day next to a banner depicting Karl Marx laid out on the conference table

Camouflage: Twin staircases leading to the 38,750 sq ft complex were concealed in a warehouse, with only this lookout post as a clue

Hidden in the woods near the city of Suhl, it was one of at least 15 similar bunkers meant to serve as command and administrative centres in case of war.

The airtight bunker - whose twin access staircases were concealed inside a warehouse - had decontamination units and oxygen tanks in case of a chemical weapons attack in the world outside.

It also had cooking facilities, bedrooms, a dining room, its own power supply and a command centre which used telegraph wires and a radio transmitter to keep up contact with the outside world.

But the bunker was not perfect - as it was not radiation-proof, and would have been safe for only a week in an all-out nuclear war.

Its active service ended in 1990 when Germany was reunified, and in 1997 it was turned into a museum which now has 20,000 visitors a year.

Rations: Many original East German food products were taken off the shelves after reunification in 1990, and there is an interest in finding old examples. The biscuit in this picture are genuine, but the 'NVA field soup' was produced later to poke fun at the regime

Say cheese! Visitor Tobias Merkel, dressed as a soldier from the East German National People's Army (NVA), photographs his friend Andreas Zahn with a mannequin in a gas mask in the warehouse placed over the bunker. It now holds a military vehicle display

Drill: The 14-hour overnight 'experience' includes preparations for chemical warfare. The bunker had oxygen tanks and air filters

Cramped: Tobias Merkel inspects his accommodation in a small dormitory. The phenomenon of reliving Communism is called Ostalgie

I call top bunk: Jesset Kogel, 15, assigns his fellow visitors to bunk beds. Others will take part in the night watch to check for 'attacks'

Dinner time: The participants preparing to cook for themselves. The bunker had supplies to keep inhabitants safe for up to a year

Not all of it survived, as top-secret aspects of a technical base in the warehouse over the bunker were destroyed completely. The warehouse now houses military vehicles instead.

Nowadays the Bunkermuseum Frauenwald is a privately-owned museum which teams up with a local hotel for its £87-a-night stays. 

Visitors dress as East German army soldiers for a more authentic experience and cook their own meals, before donning gas masks and training for a chemical weapons strike in the darkened woods.

The more hardy among them take up night watches as well as sleeping in the bunker's cramped, windowless dormitories.

But it's not quite the feat of endurance faced by their Stasi predecessors, as the fee includes 'relaxation time' the next morning in the hotel's sauna.

Thomas Krüger, who helps run the tours, told MailOnline they were popular with visitors under 30.

'The bunker is visited by some people to experience how such military installations were created and equipped,' he said. 'Others are interested in the historical and political aspect that goes into these systems.

'The level of interest is high because such military or intelligence objects are secret and unavailable to the public while they are in active operation.' 

'Younger people show an interest in the museum. They are often encouraged or taken by schools and parents to visit the bunker.'

Last week Germany marked 25 years since the fall of the Berlin Wall on November 9, 1989.

TV footage of jubilant Berlin citizens perched atop the wall, an act which for decades would have earned them a gunshot to the back, inspired people around the world and has grown in legend to become the defining image of the fall of Communism.

Sharing a joke: The visitors arrive at the bunker at 6pm from a nearby hotel and leave at 8am - with the chance to unwind in the sauna

The Bunkermuseum's popularity has increased with the rise of Ostalgie, a phenomenon which sees Germans paying big money to relive the days of the Deutsche Demokratische Republik (DDR).

The word is a combination of Ost (East) and nostalgia (nostalgie), and came to prominence a decade ago with the release of the hit film Good Bye, Lenin!

1800 Arrival and briefing at forest bunker

1830 Cook dinner with original DDR rations

2000 'Basic training' and a bunker tour

2330 Bed time - or start of the night watch

0730 Wake-up call and 'breakfast sports'

0800 Vacate the bunker and debrief 

0830 Retreat to a sauna in nearby hotel

The Bafta-nominated bittersweet comedy followed the fictional character Alex Kerner, whose mother falls into a coma shortly before the Berlin Wall falls and awakes during the rise of capitalism.

Convinced she will be unable to accept Germany's brave new world, Alex goes to impossible lengths to trick his mother into thinking the Communist state is still alive and well.

The film was followed by a string of other cinema releases and TV shows which observed the everyday lives of people in the DDR, while manufacturers of nostalgia saw sales increase.

Other relics from the Communist past - such as the hat-wearing green man (Ampelmann) marking road crossings in East Berlin - remained popular almost from the day the wall fell.  

So-called Ostalgie sparked a debate in the German media when it emerged.

While many said it was a good way to remember the past, some support groups accused the trend of 'glorifying' the past and glossing over its downsides, which included stifling state surveillance and the execution of 'traitors'.

A later hit about life in East Germany, The Lives of Others (2006), won the Oscar for best foreign-language film by painting a much grimmer picture of the DDR - delving into the Stasi's eavesdropping on those suspected of being disloyal to the regime, and the human tragedies it caused.

But Mr Krüger insisted: 'Our visitors are no more or less nostalgic than any other human being.

'They want nothing more to learn from their own history, to see and understand the political history of their country, especially if they were not involved in  intelligence or military service.'

Comrades: The bunker hidden deep in the forest has original Cold War-era memorabilia, including this East German radio and an image showing a Soviet (right) and East German soldier with the motto: 'Class brothers - weapons brothers - unified unconquerable!'

A little out of date! In one corner, a portrait of Communist Party Secretary Erich Honecker hangs over a 'modern' Robotron computer

Ears close to the ground: Military telecommunications devices in the bunker. The Stasi were famed for their surveillance programmes

Hello operator: In the case of full-blown war between East and West, the bunker would have served as a vital command post

Affectionate: An original calendar which still hangs in the bunker museum carries a pencil sketch of an East German military vehicle

Remembering the past: Visitors Eric Merkl, Marco Schmidt and Tobias Merkl mingle during the £87 tour under memorabilia of the former communist East Germany (DDR) - including the East German flag and portraits of Vladimir Lenin and other communist-era leaders
