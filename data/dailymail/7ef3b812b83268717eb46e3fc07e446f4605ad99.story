People often think they might have valuable odds and ends lying around the house.

But one lucky unsuspecting punter was left stunned when her earrings were found to contain an incredibly rare pearl.

And it could reach up to a quarter of a million pounds when it goes up for auction.

Jewellery expert Marielle Whiting examines the huge natural round pearl, which was discovered after an unsuspecting punter took an old pair of earrings into Woolley and Wallis auctioneers in Salisbury, Wiltshire

Experts were examining a pair of pearl earrings brought in to them by a man whose wife had worn them for years when they spotted the beautiful jewel.

They suspected it was a natural pearl rather than a more common cultured one and sent the precious gem to scientists in London and then Switzerland.

X-rays confirmed it was a large, natural pearl with a diameter of 0.7 inches (17.4 millimeters).

The 33.14 carat round pearl was produced by a gold lip oyster - Pinctada maxima in Latin - and would have taken around 10 years to develop in the wild.

It has been given a pre-sale estimate of £120,000 ($200,000; €145,000) by auctioneers Woolley and Wallis in Salisbury, Wiltshire.

It is the largest of its type to ever go up for auction and it is thought that it could exceed the estimate and reach £250,000 ($420,000; €300,000).

Expert Jonathan Edwards realised that what was thought to be a relatively valueless cultured pearl may actually be an enormous natural one and immediately sent it off to experts in Switzerland to have it analysed

The other earring was discovered to contain a cultured pearl, which means it had been produced by an oyster farmer in controlled conditions and is not as valuable.

It is thought to be worth around £5,000 ($8,000; €6,000) but will not be part of the sale.

Jonathan Edwards, head of the jewellery department at Woolley and Wallis, said: 'The pearl came in from a private source and was presented as part of a pair of drop earrings.

'The owner's wife had probably worn them.

'I looked at them and it seemed as though one of them might be a natural pearl, which are worth considerably more than cultured pearls.

'I thought there was a difference between the two because one had an outer layer of about one milimetre thick, but the other seemed to be solid.

'It is very difficult to tell if a pearl is cultured or natural by looking at it and you can never be 100 per cent sure unless you have it X-rayed.

They confirmed that the 33.14 carat natural gem is the largest round pearl ever to be offered at auction and would have taken around 10 years to develop in the oyster's shell

'We had it X-rayed at a London lab and they said it was natural, and we then sent it to a lab in Switzerland who said the same thing.

'The oyster that produced this pearl is a gold lip oyster, which live for about 10 years.

'It is estimated to sell for 120,000 pounds but I think it might go for a quarter of a million pounds. The owner was very surprised and excited when I told him.

'They have shot up in value over the last few years and they are on the crest of a wave.'

Bidders around the world will be flocking to the auction on 1st May at Woolley and Wallis in Salisbury to try and get their hands on this incredibly rare item.

Pearls are formed when an oyster produces layers of something called nacre as a protective mechanism.

Nacre
 is crystallised calcium carbonate that ‘blisters’ around a foreign 
contaminant inside the shell of an oyster to protect its body.

Nacre surrounds and hardens around an object, creating a pearl.

But the process can take years – the longer it is allowed to continue, the bigger the pearl as more layers of nacre are added.

The oyster will do this when there is an irritant inside their shell.

An irritant can be anything from another organism to a piece of tissue.

Cultured pearls are made by humans artificially placing an irritant inside the shell but, although the pearl will look similar, its interior will not have layers.

Natural pearls, on the other hand, are produced without any human interference and are very rare.
