England's chief medical officer, Dame Sally Davies is urging the House of Lords to approve an historic law allowing the creation of IVF babies using DNA from three different people

An historic law allowing the creation of in IVF babies using DNA from three different people would give thousands of families hope, England's chief medical officer said today. 

Dame Sally Davies is urging the House of Lords to approve the landmark law, ahead of a debate on the subject.

MPs voted earlier this month in the Commons to legalise the controversial mitochondrial donation technique, which critics say will lead to 'three parent babies'. 

If the House of Lords gives the go ahead - which seems likely - Britain will become the first country in the world to permit the procedures, aimed at preventing serious inherited mitochondrial diseases.

Opponents, including church leaders and pro-life groups, have warned that the change has been brought about too hastily and marked the start of a 'slippery slope' towards designer babies and eugenics.

But chief medical officer Dame Sally Davies said she believes the Lords should vote in favour of the amendment to the 2008 Human Fertilisation and Embryology Act.

Scientists at Newcastle University have developed a way of swapping the mother-to-be's diseased mitochondria – the 'batteries' that give cells energy – with healthy ones from another woman's egg. 

Dame Sally said: 'I want them to consider in the Lords what this is. It's quite separate from the illegal act of changing DNA in the nucleus.

'It would give these women their own children and these families hope, and I believe this is right.

'We have a very strong regulatory system that would regulate first the service and secondly would review every individual case before they could happen.'

The Government's most senior health advisor admitted if the treatment fails there would be an increased miscarriage rate, but added that there was 'no expectation of that'.

Critics have pointed out no clinical trial has taken place to show conclusively that the treatments are safe in humans.

However, three separate expert reviews for the Human Fertilisation and Embryology Authority found that the technique is ready to go forward.

Dame Sally said: 'The only clinical tests you can do are either in rats, mice and monkeys - and those have been done - or in humans and the mothers now want to do this following those three scientific reviews.

'I wouldn't call it a test, but the first cases will be scrutinised very carefully.'

She also denied the legislation would lead to a 'slippery slope' giving way to the creation of designer babies.

'This is about changing the battery packs, it's not about touching the chromosomes that make us what we are,' Dame Sally said.

'The nucleus is sacrosanct and it is illegal to touch it.

'There is no debate, nor needs there to be, about touching the chromosome, we are not talking about that, we are talking about mitochondrial transfer.' 

Research has shown that mitochondrial donation could potentially help almost 2,500 women of reproductive age in the UK who are at risk of transmitting harmful DNA mutations in the mitochondria.

It is estimated around 150 babies a year could, in future, be born as a result of the technique.

The child would have 'nuclear' DNA determining individual traits such as facial features and personality from its two parents, plus a tiny amount of mitochondrial DNA (mDNA) from an anonymous female donor. 

A free vote in the Commons saw 382 MPs vote in favour of the controversial technology. Some 128 voted against. 

David Cameron, who voted in favour of the change, said it was not 'playing God' but the chance to hep parents have a 'healthy and happy baby'.  

If the change is passed there, it would not become law until October. 

The first baby conceived with the treatment could be born as early as next year.  

The British scientist who invented the technology welcome the vote.

After MPs voted to legalise mitochondrial donation in the Commons earlier this month, a debate will be heard in the House of Lords today

Speaking following the vote in the Commons, Professor Doug Turnbull, Professor of Neurology at Newcastle University, said: 'I'm delighted for patients with mitochondrial disease. This is an important hurdle in the development of this new IVF technique but we still have the debate in the House of Lords, and importantly the licensing by the HFEA.

'Finally, I think the quality of the debate shows what a robust scientific, ethical and legislative procedure we have in the UK for IVF treatments. This is important and something the UK should rightly be proud of.' 

But some 50 MEPs have written to the Prime Minister calling for him to withdraw the legislation, which is due to be debated in the Lords today.

Meanwhile a group of Italian MPs have also called on the House of Lords to vote against the plans.

Lord Carey, the former Archbishop of Canterbury, said on Sunday, that any delay in approving this law would be 'a cruel and unnecessary delay after seven years of investigation, consultation, parliamentary discussion and scrutiny'.

He added: 'Much opposition is coming from well-organised campaigns from Catholics from Latin America and Eastern Europe. But if we cannot make any alteration, then we will deny ourselves the possibility of ever improving life for those who suffer from these intractable conditions.

'Turning our backs on these advances is uncaring and unloving. We live in an exciting time for medical research and we must support caring scientists and doctors with the resources and proper regulations to do their work.' 

Mitochondrial donation would allow IVF babies to be born with DNA from three different people should the technique be made legal.

It involves replacing DNA in an egg in order to prevent devastating inherited mitochondrial diseases.

WHAT ARE MITOCHONDRIA? 

Mitochondria are tiny rod-like structures in cells which act as power houses, generating the energy that allows our bodies to function. Unusually, they have their own DNA, distinct from the genetic material within the cell nucleus. Mitochondrial DNA (mDNA) makes up about 0.1 per cent of a cell's total DNA and does not affect individual characteristics such as appearance and personality.

WHAT CAUSES MITOCHONDRIAL DISEASE? 

Harmful mutations in mitochondrial DNA can prevent the mitochondria working properly, resulting in a number of diseases some of which can be serious and life threatening. They may affect major organs and cause conditions ranging from poor vision to diabetes and muscle wasting.

HOW ARE MITOCHONDRIAL DISEASES PASSED ON? 

Children may inherit mitochondrial DNA defects from their mothers, but not their fathers. People with faulty mDNA can develop symptoms or be carriers of the condition without experiencing ill-effects themselves.

WHAT IS MITOCHONDRIAL DONATION?

Defective mDNA from a mother's egg can be replaced with healthy mDNA from a donor. This will then prevent the harmful mutations being inherited and passed on to future generations.

WHAT ARE THE TECHNIQUES INVOLVED? 

There are two different procedures, one carried out before fertilisation and the other after.

Maternal Spindle Transfer (MST) involves first removing the nuclear DNA from a donor egg whose mitochondria are healthy. The 'spindle' of chromosomes containing the mother's nuclear DNA is then taken from her egg and inserted into the donor egg. As a result, the donor egg is left with nuclear DNA from the mother and mDNA from the donor. This healthy egg is then fertilised and implanted into the mother's womb.

Pronuclear Transfer (PT) is similar but in this case the mother's egg is fertilised first. Its nuclear DNA is then transferred to a fertilised donor egg, containing healthy mitochondria, whose own nuclear DNA has been removed. This healthy fertilised egg is then implanted.

HOW SAFE IS MITOCHONDRIAL DONATION? 

Animal and laboratory experiments suggest that the procedures are safe, but no-one can say that the risk is zero. Three separate reviews by an expert panel convened by the Human Fertilisation and Embryology's Authority have found no evidence that the techniques are unsafe for clinical use.

Critics argue that problems might only arise once the procedure is used to create human babies. For instance, replacing mDNA might have more of an impact on personal traits than had been envisaged. Unknown epigenetic effects, environmental influences that alter the way genes work, may also have serious consequences for the health of babies, it is claimed.
