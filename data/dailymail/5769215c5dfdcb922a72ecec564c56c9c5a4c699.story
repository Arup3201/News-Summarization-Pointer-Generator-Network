The biggest corn maze in the world will downsize next year after frantic visitors who got lost inside had to call 911 to be rescued.

The Cool Patch Pumpkins corn maze in Dixon, near Sacramento California spanned 63 acres this year, 20 more acres than last year. They've even been named largest corn maze in the Guinness Book of World records.

The maze stayed open until 8pm, and NBC reports that frightened navigators of the maze made calls to the Solano County Sheriff's Department after sunset.

Lost and scared: Worried visitors call 911 after getting caught in the The Cool Patch Pumpkins corn maze in California that spans a whopping 63 acres 

'Over the month that the maze was open, we got maybe seven calls, and in only three of those cases did the people actually call 911,' an officer told SF Gate.

'We tell them to relax and we put a call into the owner rather than send out a deputy.'

Matt Cooley who has been running the maze for over 12 years and said that the 911 calls might be a sign that the labyrinth has become too large for people to explore.

'My brother, who designs the maze, always wants to make it bigger and better,' he said.

'But we might scale it back a little next year.'

Despite the fact that maze explorers have been calling 911, this year has been quieter than others.

In previous years people have passed out in the middle of the maze.

'In past years we’ve had people who have passed out in there,' he said. 

'Nothing like that this year though — just a bunch of people who have gotten confused and called 911,' Cooley added.

Cooley also told SF Gate that visitors are instructed not to call 911 but despite being warned, someone always gets frightened in the middle of the maze and makes the call. 

'Sometimes you just know people will get out anyway so you let them figure it out, and sometimes we’ll get their number and talk them directly,' Cooley said.

'We’ve got guys who can navigate that thing in the dark,' Cooley added.

'So as a last resort, we’ll send in one of them to show them the way.'
