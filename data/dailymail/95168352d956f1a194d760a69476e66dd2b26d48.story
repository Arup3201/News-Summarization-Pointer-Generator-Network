A second firefighter was laid to rest in Upstate New York on Monday, exactly one week after he and a close colleague were shot to death by a crazed gunman in a horrific Christmas Eve shooting.

Tomasz Kaczowka, 19, who worked as a 911 dispatcher and volunteer firefighter, was remembered during a solemn ceremony at St Stanislau Church in Rochester.

Among the mourners was Kimberly Chiapperini, whose husband Michael was killed alongside Kaczowka in the horrific ambush.

Kaczowka had been a firefighter for less than a year, and was remembered as a courageous and vibrant young man.

On Sunday, an estimated 4,000 fire fighters, police officers, emergency medical providers, family, friends and West Webster townspeople attended the funeral of Michael Chiapperini in West Webster, near Lake Ontario.

Chiapperini, 43, who served the town as both a long-time member of its volunteer fire department as well as a police lieutenant, was killed in the early morning of Christmas Eve by William Spengler, a 62-year-old ex-con who set his own home ablaze and then opened fire once emergency personnel arrived to extinguish the flames.

'We mourn. We hurt. We cry. But we do not break,' Dane Erich reportedly said during the funeral service Sunday at Webster Schroeder High School that preceded his brother-in-law's burial at West Webster Cemetery. 'Mindless evil is not going to triumph over good.'

According to the Rochester Democrat and Chronicle, the mournful day began with a formation of uniformed fire personnel standing silently and shoulder-to-shoulder outside Webster Schroeder Hhigh School as West Webster Fire Truck 122 arrived, draped in the tell-tale  purple and black bunting of a fallen fire fighter.

Chiapperini's coffined remains waited inside the truck. 

Then - and as some of their number gingerly lowered the coffin on to a bier and subsequently carried into the school - the assembly snapped a crisp, military-like saulte.

The formation then broke ranks, and reportedly proceeded single-file into the school's auditorum, many holding hats over their hearts, and passed where the coffin had been placed, inside.

The Democrat and Chronicle reported only family and  West Webster fire and police department personnel remained in the auditorium for the succeeding service, while the rest watched a broadcast of it in the cafeteria and gymnasium.

'As we honor our fallen brothers, we stand together in the blue line'

'As we honor our fallen brothers, we stand together in the blue line,' Monroe County Sheriff Commander Dave Phelps appropriately said.

The proceedings came with a memorable - and sadly poignant - anecdote from Kimberly Chiapperini, who regaled mourners with a story rooted in the events of two weeks ago.

It was then - The Democrat and Chronicle writes - that she found a YouTube video of a firefighter’s funeral.

Michael Chiapperini reportedly told her that if he happened to die in the line of duty, not to have the bagpipers play 'Amazing Grace,' as was done in the YouTube video, at his own funeral because it was too cliche.

The police lieutenant's words brought chuckles to both him and Kimberly at the time, but were rendered prescient in retrospect by Spengler's unspeakable misdeeds. 

Nevertheless, Kimberly Chiapperini told the funeral director on Sunday to ensure the bagpipers played the hymn her husband had pointedly repudiated. 'Mike will be laughing,' she reportedly said.

And so, - as family and mourners gathered at Chiapperini's graveside, the sound of bagpipes playing 'Amazing Grace' wafted over Ridge Road, while down the street a hand-painted sign appropriately ead, 'WWFD God Bless, We ♥ You.'
