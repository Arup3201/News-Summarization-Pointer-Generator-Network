In an age where charting your life on Facebook and Pinterest is the norm, you might assume the humble scrapbook would be on its last legs.

But according to retailers the ago old hobby that fascinated children in the 1960s, 70s, and 80s is making a comeback.

Britain's craft shops are reporting a growing interest with sales of scrapbooks kits soaring in the last year.

It seems more and more people are saving photographs, newspaper and magazine cuttings, and concert tickets for posterity.

Paperchase
 said that it had enjoyed a double-digit boost in sales of scrapbook 
products in the past year and had expanded its range by 20 per cent to 
satisfy demand.

The store has launched workshops in its Glasgow and London stores, where experts show shoppers how to perfect the art of découpage — decorating something with cut-out pieces of paper.

At Hobbycraft, the arts and crafts chain, sales of scrapbook kits, which provide pre-designed layouts, have risen by 600 per cent on last year.

Making a comeback: Retailers say a younger generation have become interested in scrapbooks

Tessa Ireland, a senior buyer at Hobbycraft, told The Independent on Sunday: 'Traditional scrapbooking remains popular, but these new generations of customers are almost using these new concepts as an alternative to diaries, collecting photos, concert tickets and their captions accordingly.'

The Craft &Hobby Association UK estimates that 2.8 million British people create scrapbooks, with more than a quarter of them aged 16 to 24.

Amie Scull, a buying assistant for stationery at John Lewis, said that sales of items such as photo corners, which hold pictures in place, were increasing, as making scrapbooks returned to favour.

She said: 'This may be in part due to people wanting a return to displaying and enjoying photos, rather than just leaving them on digital cameras and computers.

'Craft in general has been back in vogue for a while, with people revisiting the joy of the manual hobbies of their childhoods.

'Of course, new social media platforms like Pinterest could also have had a positive effect, kickstarting the trend by reminding people how useful collating images and inspirational pieces into one place can be.'
