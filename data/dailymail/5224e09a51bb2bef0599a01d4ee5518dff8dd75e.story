Mix-up: Fayah Hussain discovered lumps of chicken in a Boots' vegetarian Simply Cheese and Tomato Salad after buying the product from a store in Birmingham Airport

Boots has removed its cheese and tomato pasta pot meals from its shelves after a customer complained she tucked into the vegetarian snack – and swallowed a mouthful of chicken.

The product was pulled after teenager Fayah Hussain, a Muslim who only eats halal meat, found the meat in the dish which had been labelled with a green V to mark it as a vegetarian cuisine.

Last night, the retail giant admitted it had received a small number of complaints about the Delicious Simply Cheese and Tomato Salad and temporarily removed the meal from its stores.

Fayah, who purchased the fast food at 
Birmingham Airport’s Boots outlet last Friday, alleges she was only offered a £1.90 refund and snack bar when she complained to staff about the meat content at the branch.

Fayah,
 from Yardley Wood, Birmingham, said: 'Muslims who have passed through 
Birmingham Airport must have eaten this without knowing. It’s 
disgusting.

'But this isn’t just about Muslims. How many vegetarians have eaten meat without knowing?'

Fayah said she knew immediately that there was a problem with the dish when she tasted it.

She added: 'As soon as I bit into it, I knew there was something different.

'When I looked into the pot and saw the chicken pieces, I really didn’t know what to do.

'I
 had been fasting for a month. Ramadan had just finished and it was the 
first time I was able to eat at work – and this happens!

'I felt ill, then threw-up in the toilet. When I complained, I was told this is not the first time. So why were they still on the shelves?

Removed from the shelves: It is believed a labelling error was responsible for the mix-up which resulted in Boots customers finding lumps of chicken (circled) in their Delicious Simply Cheese and Tomato Salad

'That’s what makes me so angry. I think it’s inexcusable. Even now, thinking about it makes me feel sick.'

Not satisfied with the response from the shop, Fayah complained to Boots’ head office. She says she was told the error was due to a labelling problem in the local area.

A spokeswoman for the company said: 'At Boots UK, we are proud of the quality of the products we deliver to our customers every day.

'We confirm that we received a small number of complaints on August 16, 2013, concerning a Delicious Simply Cheese and Tomato Salad and as a precautionary measure the product was temporarily removed from stores.

'We have subsequently carried out a thorough investigation together with the manufacturer and can confirm that the product is now back on sale.'

Boots have today confirmed chicken was found in the pasta pot meal.
