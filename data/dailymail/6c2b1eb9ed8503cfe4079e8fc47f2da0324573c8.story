Despite being one of the few England players to return from the World Cup with his reputation enhanced, Raheem Sterling insists he still has to prove himself for Liverpool this season.

The 19-year-old was a revelation last season as the Reds came within two points of winning the Premier League title, but Sterling returned to training in Boston knowing that the arrival of new players means his place is not guaranteed.

Speaking to LFCTour.com, he said: 'I've still got to prove myself; the manager has brought players in that are all in similar positions to me, so I've just got to keep working hard, show the manager what I can do and try not to take my foot off the gas, pressing for a place in this team.

'It's a top football club with top players, who come in to compete and do their best every day. That's been no different so far [in training].

'There is definitely much more to come from me. I just need to keep working hard and hopefully I can get into my full stride this season and try to do the best for the football club.'

Sterling introduced himself to the world at large with an inspired performance against Italy in England's opening 2-1 defeat at the World Cup. But, the fleet-footed winger paid little attention to the headlines he created.

'I didn't listen to it too much,' he reflected. 'I was told by some of my family, who told me to keep going and to try not to listen too much and play my game.'

Asked what he learned from his time in Brazil, he replied: "There are two sides to football - the international side, and the Premier League and domestic side.

'There were different sorts of tactics and players, so it was really good to be up against. It will be good for me in my learning curve going forward.

'It was a great experience for a young player to go into such a major tournament. It was a real honour and I learned a lot from it. Hopefully that can benefit me going forward with Liverpool.'

Sterling is currently in Boston for the club's US tour where players have been put through their paces with exhausting double daily sessions to prepare for the new season.

Sterling said: 'The double sessions are killers, really. We've been working hard as a group; the lads that have come back for the first week have been really putting some hard work in. It's part of the game and we're enjoying it so far.

'We have obviously been here before, two years ago. It is a nice city, a really relaxing city. Training has been tough so far but it's good. The manager is really getting us back to fitness and we're raring to go again.'

In the two years that have passed since Liverpool last visited Boston, Sterling as risen from an inexperienced fringe player into one of the game's most highly rated youngsters.

'Back then, the dream was always to play for this club and try to do as much for the club," he noted.

'But with England and stuff like that, things have come fast. But this is football. I'm taking it in my stride.

'Hopefully I can build on everything that has come my way and if we come here again in two years, hopefully it will be a similar thing.'
