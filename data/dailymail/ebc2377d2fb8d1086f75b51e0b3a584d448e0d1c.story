The multimillion-dollar California mansion once belonging to hockey legend Wayne Gretzky is again on the market.

The six-bedroom, eight-bath Thousand Oaks manor was custom-built in 2002, and will bestow its new owner with celebrity neighbors – namely, pop princess Britney Spears.

But the property has been riddled with problems since its construction, and has had problems raw sewage and litter. Still, the asking price is no discount, as it is listed for $14.995million.

Expansive manse: The 13,000-square-foot former home of Wayne Gretzky has been put on the market for $14.995million

History: The mansion was custom-designed for Wayne Gretzky by architect Richard Landry in 2002

Before and after: Disgraced former New York Mets center fielder Lenny Dykstra lost the home to foreclosure in 2010; the estate was in a sad state then, brokers said

The southern California mansion, which was designed by architect Richard Landry, has not been without problems, as AOL Real Estate reports.

Disgraced former New York Mets and Philadelphia Phillies center fielder Lenny Dykstra lost the home to foreclosure in 2010 after buying it from Gretzky in 2007 for about $17.5million.

According to court records, there was $14.28million of liens against the property, including $12.9million owed to Washington Mutual, now owned by JPMorgan Chase & Co.

Under the ownership of Dykstra, the mansion had fallen on hard times.

Grand entrance: The manor is located in a gated community by the Sherwood Country Club in Thousand Oaks, California

Amenities: The property features, among other things, a European-inspired grand fountain, left, and a chef's kitchen with wine cellar, right

Grand entry: The entrance to the mansion features a spiral staircase and contrasting light and dark wood details

Gourmet: The bright white kitchen has top appliances and marble counter tops

Casual: The mansion offers a more laid-back room for everyday entertaining and relaxation

Feature time: There is also a screening room, complete with reclining plush chairs ('Pulp Fiction' poster not included)

'The house was left by Mr. Dykstra in an unshowable state, with raw sewage escaping from the main drain line left undone,' wrote Brian Dubois of American Holdings & Land Inc in 2010, according to Reuters. 

'The home was littered throughout with empty beer bottles, trash, dog feces and urine and other unmentionables.'

He said the company restored the main drain line 'so that the house didn't become a bio hazard,' and moved to eliminate an odor that had become 'an issue with neighbors.'

The estate itself is located within the Sherwood Country Club and is described as ‘timeless.’

Home sweet home: There are six bedrooms and eight baths, and two guesthouses as well

Life of leisure: There's also a full-sized tennis court

Vistas: There's also a pool as well as a gazebo looking over the sloping hills of southern California

It has been newly remodeled ahead of its placement on the market. It is set on a 6.5-acre promontory, and offers over 13,000 square feet of living space.

Among its many features, the mansion has a movie theater, a wine cellar, a fitness center, tennis court, as well as several terraces and gardens.

The master suite has its own sitting room, as well as dual baths. 

The mansion would be a haven for foodies, with a kitchen with butler’s pantry, as well as a wood-burning pizza oven, gas barbeque, and massive formal dining room.
