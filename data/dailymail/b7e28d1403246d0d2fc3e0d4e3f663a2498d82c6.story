Newcastle owner Mike Ashley could rename Glasgow Rangers’ famous Ibrox home as the Sports Direct Arena as soon as ‘tomorrow’ if he wanted.

Sandy Easdale – chairman of Rangers’ football board – has revealed that the billionaire businessman bought the naming rights to the stadium two years ago, reportedly for just £1. 

Ashley already owns shares in the Scottish club and struck a deal for the naming rights with former chief executive Charles Green.

Change? Rangers' Ibrox stadium could be renamed the Sports Direct Arena by Newcastle owner Mike Ashley

Controversial figure: Ashley, who has shares in Rangers, bought Ibrox naming rights two years ago

And Easdale told the Daily Record: ‘Let’s clear this up, the Sports Direct Arena.

‘Charles Green had already done a deal with Mike on that. Sports Direct haven’t taken it up as yet. Mike Ashley could call it the Sport Direct Arena tomorrow.’ 

Ashley tried to rebrand Newcastle’s home as sportsdirect.com@St James’ Park in 2011 and then the Sports Direct Arena. However, after strong opposition from supporters and the local council, the club announced the ground would revert to being called St James’ Park.

Meanwhile, Ashley successfully rebranded Oldham Athletic’s Boundary Park as SportsDirect.com Park earlier this year.
