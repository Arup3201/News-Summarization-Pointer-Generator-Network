A tiny wooden beach hut with no water, electricity or even a toilet has sold for a staggering £180,000 within days of going on the market.

But while it may not have many mod cons or amenities, and cost as much as a three bedroom house in Liverpool, the 12ft x 18ft hut boasts priceless views over the The Solent towards the Isle of Wight.

The one-bedroom cabin, which sleeps four people at a squeeze, opens directly onto the beach at Mudeford near Christchurch, Dorset - one of the most sought after pieces of real estate in the world.

But with no mains sewerage, there is no toilet and the buyer will have to walk a nearby amenity block to spend a penny.

The hut went on the market a few weeks ago and sold within days for a rumoured £180,000, it emerged today.

Will Wright, of Waterside Properties, said: 'There was definitely a lot of interest - that’s for sure.

'It was talk of the town when it went up for sale.

'The beach huts down there are so popular, I am not surprised it sold so quickly.'

The new owner - who does not want to be named - now owns the leasehold on the property until 2029 and will have to pay a yearly service charge of £1,986.00 to Christchurch Borough Council.

It qualifies for a reduced council tax bill of £499.56 but can only be lived in for a maximum of ten months of the year.

Former owner Sarah Litchfield, 48, who owned the property for the last 10 years, said she agonised over the decision to sell.

She said: 'I had a mad moment 10-years-ago and bought it, I’m a local girl and everyone dreams of having one.

'I have spent many happy years down there and it has been a tough decision to sell.'

 

You’d be forgiven for thinking a one bedroom cabin at £180,000 is a unique lot on the housing market.

But, in parts of the UK, these tiny ‘properties’ come with massive price tags. Boasting ‘near by’ taps and shared showers, it’s amazing how much we will pay for some sand beneath our feet and a view of the sea.

We take a look at five of the UK's most expensive beach huts...

1. A kitsch baby blue beach hut measuring just 23ft by 6ft in Shaldon, South Devon comes with breathtaking views of the village harbour and a whopping £245,000 price tag.

This luxury cabin comes with under floor heating, a marble wet room and electric windows which automatically close when it rains. The quaint huts can be hired out to tourists for £90 a night.

The developer, Bernard Howard, said: ‘The position is exceptional - at high tide you can practically dip your toes into the sea. 

‘The hut hides a deceptively spacious interior, like Dr Who's Tardis, he said.

2. A one-room former harbour master's hut (pictured below) was put on the market for the eye-watering asking price of £250,000.

The hut at Rozel Bay Quay, Jersey, boasts views across the harbour of the fishing port and as far as France.

3. A bottle green beach hut in East Anglia went on the market for a whopping £70,000.

Holidaymakers visiting Wells-next-the-Sea has steps down onto the beach, where scenes from the Hollywood blockbuster Shakespeare in Love, were filmed.

The hut also boasts royal links, as footage of a young Prince Charles and his sister Anne playing on Holkham beach emerged last year. Despite its lofty connections,  the hut boasts a 'close-by' water tap and a lavatory block for the beach.

4. A one-room hut on Mudeford Spit, Dorset is on one of the most sought-after stretches of real estate in the country.

The cabin has no running water, no mains electricity, and very little in the way of creature comforts, but it more that makes up for that with a breath-taking location.

5. A 17ft by 15ft timber hut with a felt roof went on the market for a staggering £280,000 back in 2007. The building sits on the seafront at West Bexington, Dorset, in the heart of Britain's Jurassic Coast.
