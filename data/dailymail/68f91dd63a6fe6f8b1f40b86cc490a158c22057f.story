Barrister Simon Watters is now banned from hosting future events at North Cottesloe primary school

A Perth barrister, who allegedly mocked homosexuals, ethnic groups and billionaire Gina Rinehart at a primary school quiz night, is now banned from being the MC at future events, but he doesn't see what all of the fuss is about.

Simon Watters shocked some attendees at the North Cottesloe Primary School event on Friday with 'a relentless bombardment of sexist, racist, homophobic and xenophobic utterances', according to local website The Starfish.

Many guests reportedly booed as he used the terms `f**gots' and `frogs, wogs and Nazis', and asked the crowd if any of them was 'a Thalidomide child'.

He is also reported to have made an insulting comment about Australian mining heiress Gina Rinehart's appearance to the startled 250-odd crowd. 

Mr Watters said it was upsetting that people on one table didn't see the humour as it was intended.

'No comments were made to offend anyone,' Mr Watters told AAP.

'In fact, much of the humour was directed at myself and friends in the audience.'

'The next day, so many people rang me to say that they had not laughed so much for a long time.'

Mr Watters said he was bewildered by the focus on his comments, which he thought were 'quite tame' compared to many stand-up comedy acts.

The barrister said he did his best to coax as much money as possible from the audience during the event, which raised about $50,000 for the school.

P&C president Celia Patrick said the barrister had hosted the event two years prior and was a popular choice for quizmaster, and had apologised to those he may have offended.

Ms Patrick said it was only a small group of guests that were upset by some of the comments and the P&C had only received positive feedback about the evening, which was attended by about 260 people.

One parent who attended the night told AAP the barrister was joking among friends and they did not hear him make any racist comments.

However, Principal Wayne Press, who was there on the night, said in a statement that the barrister made several deeply offensive and hurtful remarks, and would not be invited to MC future school events. 

'Many members of the school community worked extremely hard to organise the event,' Mr Press said.

'Unfortunately, the MC, who is not a member of our school community and was invited by the P&C, made a number of remarks during the evening which were deeply offensive and hurtful.

'I would like to state clearly that these offensive comments in no way reflect the values of our school.'

Mr Press said the barrister would not be invited to MC any events at the school in the future.

'I will be working with the school board and the P&C to develop stronger protocols for the hosting, compering and running of future events so these unacceptable actions do not occur,' he said.

Mr Press added while some humour is appropriate at a primary school quiz night, some of the comments went beyond what would be deemed reasonable.
