Selfless: Jose Montano, 13, lost his battle with cancer on Sunday, almost three years after he was diagnosed with the disease

A 13-year-old cancer sufferer who used his Make-a-Wish request to build a playground for his friends has died.

Jose Montano from South Bay, San Diego, passed away on Sunday, just five days before what would have been the third anniversary of his diagnosis.

His father announced the tragic news on a Facebook profile set up to raise awareness of a charity set up in his name.

The post on the page read: 'Five days before his third year anniversary of
 being diagnosed, Jose, my hero, my baby, my teacher was called to 
heaven yesterday.

'I know he is now playing in God's playground and being
 our guardian angel.

'Thank you Choncho for blessing my family and for 
teaching us life's most important lessons.

'We will remember you every 
single day for the rest of our lives. Te amo mi niño chulo.'

Jose had a golf-ball sized tumor on the base of his brain and was forced to have surgery in 2011, followed by rounds of intense chemotherapy and radiation treatment, according to NBC 7

When Make-a-Wish approached him, he could have requested a personal experience of a lifetime or an exotic family holiday.

Instead, he asked the charity to build a new playground for his classmates at Berry Elementary School.

When the playground opened in March 2012, Jose was asked why he did not opt for a trip to Disney World.

Act of kindness: When Make-a-Wish approached him, rather than using the request himself, he asked for a playground to be built at Berry Elementary School for his friends

Disease: Jose had brain surgery and underwent rounds of chemotherapy and radiation treatment after his diagnoses in 2011

But he said: 'I felt that they needed my wish more.'

However, this was not Jose's only act of kindness. He also delivered gift bags to other young patients at the hospital where he was being treated.

He also received the American Red Cross Youth Hero Award and was honored by the San Diego County Board of Supervisors with a Jose Montano Day in December 2013.

The foundation, set up in his name, supplies healthy snacks and toys for children battling cancer in local hospitals.
