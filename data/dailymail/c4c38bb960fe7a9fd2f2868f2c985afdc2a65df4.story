The widow of a bomb disposal expert killed in Afghanistan has defended war widows' rights to move on and find love again.

Christina Schmid, from Hampshire, said it was 'sad' when women were criticised for finding new partners and said it was easier for men to move on than women.

Her comments follow the condemnation of Kirianne Curley, who had a relationship with two of her dead husband's best friends after the Royal Marine was killed by a bomb in Afghanistan.

Mrs Schmid, who has now found love with 
new partner Mark Clarke, 30, told BBC Radio Four's Woman's Hour: 'It's 
just the nature of people to judge. It's very sad.'

Speaking about her relationship she said: 'It just means that I'm allowing somebody into my life again and that I'm ready to love again.'

She said she'd received support in the last few weeks, and said some widowers she had spoken to had 
moved on in three to six months.

Mrs Curley, 28, who had been left to bring up the couple’s 17-week-old son
William alone, soon began a relationship with her husband Corporal Stephen Curley's friend and colleague Corporal Ben Wilmott, after he died in 2010.

Unknown to her new lover, however, she also became involved with his fellow Marine Matthew Cotterill.

When Wilmott found out, he began a 
campaign of harassment against Mrs Curley and his rival, bombarding them
with offensive and threatening text messages, emails and phone calls.

He was sentenced to six weeks in jail by magistrates in Exeter, suspended for two years.

All three servicemen had previously 
enjoyed a strong friendship and were compared to the Three Musketeers during the court hearing in Exeter.

Mrs Schmid met Clarke, 36, who is also a serving member of the Armed 
Forces, six months ago and believes her late husband would give them his
blessing.

Her husband Staff
Sgt Olaf Schmid, 30, died while trying to defuse a bomb in Afghanistan 
in October 2009, 24 hours before he was due to fly home.

Has his blessing: Christina with Oz, whom she still loves and misses everyday

He was awarded a posthumous George Cross for his bravery, which saw him disarm more than 60 explosive devices in six months.

Mrs Schmid was left devastated but knew she had to be strong for her son Laird, who is now eight.

Speaking to Hello magazine earlier this month she said: ‘I didn’t know if I would ever be able
to love again after I lost Oz, but Mark has taught me that I can; that I
have a lot of love still left to give and a lot of life left to live.'

She said her love
for her husband has ‘not in any way diminished’ and she misses him 
every day.

But she added: ‘I
have been lucky enough to meet this lovely man who cares deeply for me 
and wants to be with me – and I adore him.’
