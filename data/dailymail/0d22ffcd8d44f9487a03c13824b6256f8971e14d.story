Lisa Fairpo, 36, of Withernsea, East Yorkshire, is accused of plotting to kill her husband for his life insurance

A shopaholic wife plotted to murder her husband because she was on the brink of bankruptcy and hoped he would to take out £750,000 life insurance, a court heard.

Lisa Fairpo, 36, texted her husband offering to pay for the maximum cover the day after the hired hitman was told the deal to kill her estranged husband, Andrew Burr, was still on, Hull Crown Court heard today.

Mother-of-two Mrs Fairpo, of Withernsea, East Yorkshire, gave her husband of eight years the number of a life insurance broker, and when he rang him on her instructions he joked: 'I think my wife is trying to kill me,' the court was told.

The murder, which was planned for June or July this year, never went ahead because the would-be hitman, Maikel Ward, 42, walked into a London police station in April and said he couldn't go through with it, it was alleged.

Ward said he had come to his senses and wanted to stop someone else carrying out the hit. He said he had been told he would be paid £10,000 to stab - rather than shoot - his victim to make him suffer, the court heard.

Today Fairpo was accused of conspiring to murder her estranged husband in what was the first day of a retrial held because the jury in the first trial held in September could not reach a verdict.

Opening the case against Fairpo, prosecutor Mark McKone said that she and her lover Darren Wilson plotted to kill Mr Burr so they could collect his life insurance of up to £750,000.

Defendant: Fairpo is a 'shopaholic' who was 'on the brink of bankruptcy', Hull Crown Court heard today

He said Fairpo was a 'shopaholic' with 'massive debts' who was on the brink of bankruptcy and could not get credit.

Mr McKone added: 'She had another positive reason for 
disliking her husband: Andrew Burr had punched Lisa Fairpo in her eye and blinded her.

'If that was not bad enough, she had a medical illness with 
her other eye and there was a risk of being blinded.'

The court heard that Fairpo had been with Mr Burr for 13 years and had a daughter with him, but she never took his surname.

Mr McKone said Fairpo was having an affair with loan shark Darren Wilson, 45, who had offered the hitman £10,000 to carry out the killing with a knife.

Estranged husband: Andrew Burr, 37, from Hull, was the intended target of a murder plot, it was alleged

He said Wilson had already been found guilty of conspiracy to murder Mr Burr while hitman Ward had admitted the conspiracy, and it was now up to the jury to decide whether Fairpo had been 'in on it' too.

The court heard how Mr Burr had no idea about what his wife was planning, but that when she was arrested she told police: 'I know what this is about.'

She told officers she had separated from her husband and didn’t love him, but had been on holiday with Wilson and discussed doing something to her husband to teach him a lesson for his having punched her in the eye.

Hitman who lost his nerve: Maikel Ward, 42, was lined up to kill Mr Burr but then gave himself up to police, the court heard

The prosecutor said that Fairpo, who met Wilson when she fostered his son for four years, was primarily motivated by the insurance money.

He said: 'The prosecution says she must have agreed to pay the life insurance to someone as without it Darren Wilson could not have afforded to pay Maikel Ward £10,000 to carry out the killing.

'The prosecution does not have to prove a motive, but the prosecution says that Lisa Fairpo’s primary motive was financial.'

Ward told the police Darren Wilson had offered him £10,000 to kill a painter and decorator, but he did not know his name. He said Wilson wanted it done with a knife rather than a gun because he wanted the victim to suffer, the jury heard.

Mr McKone said: 'Her husband had jokingly asked her if she was going to get Wilson to kill her and she replied "yes” as a joke.'

Mr McKone said the case only emerged when the real hitman, Maikel Ward, walked into a London police station and revealed the plot in April this year.

He said he owed Wilson £1,500 for a debt he could not repay. He did not know who was to be killed, only that the victim was a painter and decorator. Mr Burr is a painter and decorator.

Mr McKone said Fairpo told police although she was separated from her husband, she still saw him every day and he was a good father.

He said she told police she did not hold her eye injury against him because she received so much in benefits as a result.

Fairpo denies conspiracy with Darren Wilson and Maikel Ward to murder Andrew Burr between 1 January and 13 April this year.

The trial continues.
