Amie Miller, 15, died within days of being admitted to Basildon Hospital due to lethal swelling on the brain

A teenage girl died after a catalogue of failings at a hospital already condemned for poor care.

Amie Miller - who would have celebrated her 21st birthday this week - had been suffering agonising headaches while completing her mock GCSEs.

The 15-year-old student began vomiting and fitting on November 16, 2008, and was immediately rushed to Basildon Hospital A&E.

But she died within days of being admitted due to lethal swelling on the brain.

Last year a coroner ruled 'serious failings' in care at Basildon Hospital had contributed to her death.

The damning verdict came at the end of a three-day inquest at Chelmsford Coroner’s Court last September.

The inquest had heard that Amie was given Propofol - a powerful sedative blamed for the death of pop star Michael Jackson - despite it not being recommended for people under 18.

The inquest jury also found medics at the hospital missed a string of opportunities to save Amie’s life in 2008.

In a damning narrative verdict, they said staff had failed to take even the most basic steps – such as checking whether she could open her eyes, or examining the size of her pupils – which might have alerted them to her injury.

After the inquest, Amie’s stepfather Mbarek Aitmarri said the past five years had been torture.

He said the hospital – which is under special measures and is one of 14 singled out for having high death rates – had ‘evaded’ responsibility for her death and had failed to respond to 81 allegations of negligence they had lodged.

Her parents are now taking legal action.

Her father, Mbarek Aitmarri, from Thurrock, Essex, said: 'She wanted to be a paediatrician. What she wanted to be is what the people who failed her are. The betrayal is unbelievable.

'All her peers and friends met up in the cemetery - they are now in their twenties and getting their degrees.

'I wish we were at that stage, but all we have is basically a hole in the ground. We have all suffered post-traumatic stress.

'Most people who lose someone go through a grieving process, but for us, it hasn’t started.'

Propofol is an intravenous anaesthetic drug widely used in operating rooms to induce unconsciousness. It is generally given through an IV needle in the hand.

Patients given Propofol take less time to regain consciousness than those administered certain other drugs, and they report waking up more clear-headed and refreshed, says University of Chicago psychopharmacologist James Zacny.

It has also been implicated in drug abuse, with people using it to 'chill out' - or to commit suicide, Zacny said.

Accidental deaths linked to abuse have been reported.

The powerful drug has a very narrow therapeutic window, meaning it doesn't take doses much larger than the medically recommended amount to stop a person's breathing.

An overdose that stops breathing can result in a build-up of carbon dioxide, causing the heart to beat erratically and leading to cardiac arrest, said Dr. John Dombrowski, a member of the board of directors of the American Society of Anesthesiologists.

The family believe they were wrongly advised to abandon a vital post-mortem examination because they wanted to donate Amie’s organs to others in need.

Her father added: Amie died in 2008 and we are still waiting for the hospital to perform an investigation.

'After she died, they approached us within half an hour.

'I was asking what was going to happen to Amie and the lady at the hospital said there was someone there for organ donation.

'They explained if they did a post-mortem examination, it wouldn't be possible to donate Amie’s organs.

'But when we later had a meeting with the hospital, we found a post-mortem examination could have been conducted without the organ donation being affected.'

The family marked what would have been Amie’s 21st birthday by releasing a balloon in her memory from their home in Stanford-le-Hope on Monday.

A statement released by Basildon and Thurrock University Hospitals NHS Foundation Trust said the trust 'would like to share its condolences with Amie Miller’s family at what must be an incredibly difficult time.

'We have apologised for the failings in the care provided to Amie, and have since introduced a number of changes in the treatment of children and adults with neurological illness, including more regular observations.'
