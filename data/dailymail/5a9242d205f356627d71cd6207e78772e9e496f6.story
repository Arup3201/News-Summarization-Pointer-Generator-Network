A Victorian space observatory where some of the world’s earliest photographs of the moon were taken has been saved.

Photographic pioneer John Dillwyn Llewelyn took early pictures of the moonscape in 1857 from the observatory.

The 'nationally important' building on the Penllergare estate, near Swansea, South Wales, was crumbling after years of neglect.

Photographer: Wealthy industrialist and renaissance man John Dillwyn Llewelyn (pictured) built the observatory in 1846

Important: The building (pictured in the 1800s) was crumbling after years of neglect

But it has now been saved by a £2.9m Lottery Heritage Fund restoration project.

The astronomical observatory was built in 1846 by wealthy industrialist and renaissance man John Dillwyn Llewelyn - a founder member of the Royal Photographic Society.

After installing a telescope in the building, he and his daughter Thereza captured some of the earliest photographs of the moon.

Llewelyn was a noted botanist, scientist, abolitionist and a health campaigner as well as a world-renowned photographer.

Saved: The historic observatory and surviving estate woodlands have been saved by a £2.9m Heritage Lottery Fund grant

Site: Llewelyn inherited Penllergare house and estate in 1833 and built the astronomical observatory in 1846

Queen Victoria and Prince Albert bought many of his pioneering works to add to their growing photographic collection.

Prestige: Llewelyn was also a noted botanist, scientist, abolitionist and a health campaigner

His invention of the Oxymel process - the use of honey and vinegar to instantly preserve images - in the 1850s meant landscape photographers could do away with cumbersome portable laboratories and darkroom tents.

Llewelyn’s industrialist family owned the Cambrian pottery in Swansea, South Wales, and he inherited Penllergare house and estate in 1833.

He died in 1882, aged 72, and by the 1930s the house and estate began a period of decline.

For more than half a century the Penllergare estate was almost forgotten and the mansion was destroyed and replaced by council offices.

But now the historic observatory and surviving estate woodlands have been saved for the nation by a £2.9m Heritage Lottery Fund grant.

Penllergare Trust chairman Terry Jones said: 'The observatory is the scientific legacy of John Dillwyn Llewelyn.

'It has survived over half a century of neglect along with the picturesque designed landscape garden in the valley below.

'We’re looking forward to bringing this nationally important historic structure back into good condition and conserving it for public benefit.'

The Victorian era saw an increase in peoples' interest in space and astronomy as technologies improved to allow those with a growing amount of wealth and leisure time to follow such pursuits.

Rebekah Higgitt, curator of history of science and technology at the Royal Observatory, Greenwich, said a number of observatories opened across both Europe and America during this time.

She said: 'It was the 19th century that saw a real explosion of the number of observatories in Europe and America and Britain was very much part of that.

'In Britain in particular that has been driven by amatuer astronomers who are wealthy enough to fund observatories themselves for their own interests.'

Ms Higgitt said astronomers at the time developed interests in using photography and spectroscopy as ways of exploring the heavens.
