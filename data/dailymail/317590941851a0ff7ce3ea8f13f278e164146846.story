WikiLeaks founder Julian Assange has lost a legal bid to have an arrest warrant issued in Sweden against him cancelled.

A judge in Stockholm decided to uphold the warrant against him for alleged sexual offences against two women.

The decision by Judge Lena Egelin dashes hopes of a breakthrough in the Australian’s case.

Wikileaks founder Julian Assange, pictured, has lost a legal battle as he fights extradition to Sweden

He has been living in the Ecuadorian Embassy in London for more than two years as part of his bid to avoid extradition to Sweden.

He believes that if he travels to Sweden, he will be sent on to the United States for questioning over the activities of the whistleblowing organisation.

His Swedish lawyer said he will appeal against today’s decision.

A court order to cancel the warrant would have been a step towards enabling the 43-year-old Australian to leave the London embassy.

Supporters of Mr Assange gathered outside the embassy in London’s Knightsbridge area, holding up banners calling for him to be freed.

His lawyers lodged legal papers in Sweden last month shortly after the second anniversary of his dramatic arrival at the London embassy.

He has been granted political asylum by Ecuador, but faces arrest the moment he steps outside the building.

Police officers have been stationed outside the embassy since he arrived there.

In April it was revealed that guarding the Ecuadorian embassy in London where Julian Assange has claimed asylum had cost taxpayers almost £6million.

Metropolitan Police officers have been standing outside the Knightsbridge building since the WikiLeaks founder took refuge there in June 2012 - a vigil costing £11,000 per day.

For more than two years he has lived in the embassy because he fears he will be extradited to America after he enraged the White House by releasing thousands of its secrets in 2010.

At all times there are three Scotland Yard officers waiting outside the embassy to arrest him.

At least one stands on the steps and others will question visitors leaving in case it is Assange in disguise.

The cost of this up to April this year was £5.9million, including £1million in overtime costs.

At the time Baroness Jenny Jones, deputy chair of the Police and Crime Committee condemnded the huge cost as 'ludicrous'.

He has endured a self-imposed imprisonment in a single room after being given diplomatic asylum at the Ecuadorian embassy in London’s Knightsbridge.

The embassy — strewn with red, yellow and blue Ecuadorian flags — takes up a single floor of an imposing block behind Harrods.

Initially, Assange slept on an inflatable mattress donated by embassy staff, who are described as having become ‘like family’ to him.

But when it became clear his stay was not going to be temporary, a small room was transformed into his living quarters and a bed installed.

He is thought to have stood in direct sunlight for only about 20 minutes during his incarceration, when he emerged on the balcony to address his supporters in August 2012.

He has a specially adapted lamp to mimic sunlight in his room — which measures just 15ft by 13ft.

Near a Victorian fireplace he has a treadmill donated by the Left-wing film-maker Ken Loach and in his first year at the embassy he notched up 744 miles on the running machine.

Revealing the £5.9million cost in a Freedom of Information request, Scotland Yard said the costs included £1million in overtime costs.

In a meeting last month with reporters at the embassy to mark his second year of hiding, Assange said he had no intention of going to Sweden.

He claimed this was because he has no guarantees he would not subsequently be sent to the United States.

Officials there are maintaining their investigation into WikiLeaks' dissemination of hundreds of thousands of classified U.S. documents.
