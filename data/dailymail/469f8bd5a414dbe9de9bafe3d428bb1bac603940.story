There must have been many occasions when critics of controversial Toronto mayor Rob Ford have wanted to throw a bucket of ice over his head - and now he has done the job for them.

Mr Ford performed the stunt as part of the ALS Ice Bucket Challenge charity fundraising craze that is sweeping the internet, in which people around the world pour buckets of ice water over their heads  and then nominate someone else to follow suit.

The nominee has 24 hours to comply or donate $100 to the charity as a forfeit.

Among the celebrities who have joined the craze are pop stars Justin Bieber and Britney Spears, and golfer Tiger Woods. 

Mr Ford, 45, went through with the stunt after being nominated by former Toronto Maple Leafs ice hockey player Tie Domi, who got his soaking last week.

In a video posted on YouTube, Domi helped the mayor's brother, Doug Ford, empty a garbage bin full of ice water over the mayor's head.

In the video, the mayor stands in front of a large 'Ford for Mayor' banner and says: 'Hi, I am Mayor Ford. I have been called out by legendary Maple Leaf Tie Domi for the ice bucket challenge for ALS.'

Turning to Domi, he shouts: 'Tie, I accept your challenge. Let's bring it on.'

Domi and Doug Ford appear, pick up a plastic bin emblazoned with more 'Ford Mayor' stickers and tip it over the his head.

Mr Ford shudders and laughs before regaining his composure and taking his turn to nominate three more victims.

He says: 'Now, I'm going to call out three people - that's cold - Jimmy Kimmel, I want you to do the Ice Bucket Challenge. [Ontario] premier Kathleen Wynne, I want you to do the Ice Bucket Challenge. And Prime Minister Stephen Harper, I want you to do the Ice Bucket Challenge to help cure this terrible disease.'

All money raised from the campaign goes to the ALS Association, which is looking for a cure for Amyotrophic lateral sclerosis, a spinal cord disease also known as Lou Gehrig's disease, and Motor Neurone Disease.

Mr Ford's spokeman said he would donate $100, and after her nomination Mrs Wynne posted a message on Twitter saying that she would also donate $100.

Mr Ford has previously been embroiled in a number of scandals, including drink-driving and smoking crack cocaine.
