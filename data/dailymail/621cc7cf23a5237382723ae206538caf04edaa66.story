An Indiana woman was expecting to deliver her baby daughter at home with the help of midwives at the end of January - but Mother Nature had other plans in store.

Mariah Grove's little girl was due January 21, but the first-time mother went into labor Monday morning as a snowstorm raged in Indianapolis.

On Sunday night, the city was walloped by the heaviest snowfall so far this season, causing road closures and widespread power outages.

Miracle baby: When Mariah Grove went into labor while home alone during a massive snowstorm, she decided to go it alone and delivered her baby daughter without any assistance

Impatient: Grove was due to give birth January 21, but her baby arrived more than two weeks ahead of schedule

'She wanted to see this blizzard,' Grove told the station RTV6, referring to her bundle of joy. 'She didn't want to miss out.'

The young woman went into labor late Sunday - more than two weeks ahead of schedule. Her husband was not home at the time.

Grove called the midwives and her mother, but no one could come to her in time because of the winter storm that dumped 8 inches of snow on the ground.

Miss Grove was all alone when her water broke at around 2am. Rather than give in to panic, the first-time mom proceeded with her home birthing plan on her own, turning her bedroom into a makeshift delivery room.

Luckily for the mother and child, there were no complications with the solo birth: the infant emerged from her mother's womb crying and looking pink and healthy.

‘Once the water broke and I realized this was it, all fear went away. I realized it wasn't going to help me and that we would be a team and do this together. And we did it,’ Grove said.
