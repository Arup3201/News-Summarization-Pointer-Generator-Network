When someone overweight claims to eat healthily and exercise but sill can't shift the pounds, it can be difficult to believe them.

But that is just the situation Londoner Sidone Price found herself in after doctors said her almost permanent bloating and excessive weight was down to IBS.

Fortunately Sidoine did not give up the fight to find a diagnosis and, on a colleague's advice, sought a food intolerance test - and found the real reason behind her size.

Airport Lounge Manager Sidone, 26, says: 'I had always been quite curvy, but over the last few years I had noticed my weight just kept creeping up, so I decided to do something about it.'

She started eating much healthier, sticking 
to five small meals a day with a mixture of lean protein and lots of 
vegetables and salads.

But Sidone struggled to shift much of her uncomfortable 14st weight.

Doctors said Sidoine's incessant bloating and excessive weight was down to IBS

'I also joined a gym and started working out three times a week. I noticed that some of the weight came off, but it just seemed really slow and I wasn't seeing the results I was expecting considering how healthily I was eating and how much effort I was putting in at the gym.

'I was also constantly bloated every time I'd eat which was causing me a lot of pain and discomfort, not to mention left me feeling I felt embarrassed.

'Months of healthy eating and exercise 
were proving to have little effect, especially on my stomach area which 
remained stubbornly bloated.

'I became quite anxious about the situation and so I went to see my GP. He wasn't very helpful and just told me to carry on as I was, telling me that the bloating was probably just IBS and that the weight would fall off eventually.

'In desperation I tried a radical 
diet that involved eating mainly raw carrots and houmous at lunch, but again this proved to have little effect.

'It
 was then that a colleague suggested that I might have a food 
intolerance and recommended that I try a food intolerance test.

Sidoine was able to shed those stubborn excess pounds she'd been trying so hard to get rid of

'When the results came back they revealed that I had intolerances to a number of the 'healthy' foods I'd been munching for the past few months - including carrots!'

'Cutting these from my diet had an almost instantaneous effect. Within days my stomach was noticeably flatter and my IBS symptoms had greatly reduced.'

'As well as carrots, I also found out 
that I am intolerant to cow's milk and yeast. I have cut these 
completely from my diet. Three months later I am still sticking to my
 new diet.

The YorkTest intolerance test made Sidone change her eating habits immediately and while she carries on with her healthy diet from before, she has had to find alternatives to her reactive foods:  carrots, cow's milk and yeast.

'I
 eat quite a lot of stir-fried vegetables as I find just boiled veg can 
be quite dull. Where before I'd always throw in some carrots, now I've
 replaced this with other veg such as courgettes.

'As I've completely 
cut out cow's milk, I now use almond and soya milk for smoothies and 
soups.

'Wine contains yeast so I have also replaced my usual white wine for spirits. I'll go for a G&T now instead of a glass of wine.

'I also steer clear of using dressings and sauces because they can contain yeast too. I've stopped using soya sauce when I make stir-fry as I've struggled to find a yeast-free version.'

In the months that followed Sidoine was able to shed the stubborn excess pounds she had been trying so hard to get rid of.

'I don't yet have a boyfriend but I am 
dating. I didn't feel confident about dating before but I do much more
 now. Also I'm much more confident on 
holiday and in summer clothes - I can finally enjoy clothes shopping now whereas
 before I would avoid it,' she said.

She
 now weighs in at a svelte 9st 7lbs, losing well over 4st, and wears a size 12 - three sizes down from her peak at size 18. 'It feels like my entire life has changed', she says.

'I wouldn't go back to my old diet and I'll make sure I never have trigger 
foods again... I've gone cold turkey.'

Recent research suggests a direct correlation between food intolerance and weight gain.

Last year's Obesity and Weight loss Therapy research
 entitled: Eliminating Immunologically-Reactive Foods from the Diet and 
its Effect on Body Composition and Quality of Life in Overweight Persons
 found that by simply cutting trigger foods out of your diet, the battle
 of the bulge could be over.

'Cutting carrots, cow's milk and yeast had an almost instant effect and within days my stomach was flatter'

Breakfast: porridge or a smoothie for breakfast (strawberry, banana and blueberry with some natural live yogurt)

Lunch: carrots and reduced fat hummus (which she later learned was no good for her)

Dinner: chicken with stir fried vegetables (onions, mushrooms, bean 
sprouts, carrots, peppers), salmon and salad, omelette (usually using 
skimmed milk)

Breakfast: Smoothie (strawberry, blueberries, banana and soya or almond milk)

Lunch: Soup (homemade potato and leek or root vegetable minus carrots and using dairy-free cream) 

Dinner: omelette minus milk, jacket potato with tuna and sweetcorn, chicken with vegetables (broccoli, cauliflower)

With even seemingly healthy foods such as lettuce having the potential to cause a reaction, the study shows it could be beneficial to find out your own personal triggers.

The research assessed the effect that IgG food sensitivity tests and the subsequent elimination of trigger foods for a period of 90 days had on the body composition and quality of life of 120 overweight people.

The results showed that the subjects who eliminated the foods they reacted to 'had reductions in weight, body mass index, waist and hip circumferenceâ€¦ and all indicators of quality of life'.

'Food intolerance is a serious issue and is often misdiagnosed. I meet numerous clients who consistently eat healthy and exercise regularly but still find it hard to shift those last few pounds.

'Food intolerances can cause an immune response in the body which can lead to weight gain or difficulty in losing weight' nutritionist, Alli Godbold.

Dr. Gill Hart, Scientific Director at YorkTest, explains: 'A stressed digestive system is less able to process energy and nutrients for the rest of the body. It will also be less able to repel harmful invaders and may be more prone to disorders such as IBS.

'Once the immune response is triggered in the body, it feels that it is under siege thus hoarding supplies, storing fluid and increasing weight.'
