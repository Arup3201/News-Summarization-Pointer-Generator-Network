A teacher's union in Michigan is fighting to force a city school district to pay a teacher convicted of molesting a student a $10,000 severance buyout, outraging the family of the young victim.

The Michigan Education Association is planning to take the case to arbitration in an attempt to force the West Branch-Rose City School District to pay former math teacher Neal Erickson - who was sentenced to 15 to 30 years in prison for repeatedly molesting the student - the buyout, a move the victim's family calls 'ludicrous.'

The money, the victim's father, John Janczewski, says any money owed to Erickson by the district should be given to his son, who is 'out there trying to make it in this world all messed up.'

Monster: Neal Erickson was convicted of raping one of his students. Now he wants the district to pay him a severance fee

'Are they nuts in 
the head? How can the union file a grievance and back a child molester? 
We’re very upset about it,' Janczewski told EAGnews.

Erickson was convicted over the summer of raping the young student over a three year period - from 2006 to 2009. The community was outraged when several other teachers in the district wrote letters supporting Erickson, and urging the judge to give him a more lenient sentence.

Adding to the outrage was the fact that a school board member, Mike Eagan, sat with Erickson's family during his sentencing after he pleaded guilty to first-degree sexual misconduct with a minor on May 8.

Many members of the community rallied behind the victim's parents and urged the school board to fire teachers who were supporting Erickson. The district, however, opted to keep Erickson's supporters rather than deal with the potential legal consequences of firing them.

The union's claim for Erickson stems from an offer the school district made to teachers in March, which offered the $10,000 buyout to teachers to encourage them to quit rather than being laid off as the district needed to reduce staff due to budget cuts.

The union's plan to seek the $10,000 for Erickson suggests that he was still on the payroll when it was offered, and that he accepted it - despite having already been indicted for molesting the boy.

The district, however, declined to pay him the money, which is what prompted the union's action.

'You had to qualify for the buyout, depending on your years in the 
district,' district Superintendent Dan Cwayna EAG News. 'We’ve done it in the past. It was a little 
different this last year in that we offered the buyout in two $5,000 
payments.'

Cwayna added that 'When the first payment was sent out...and the union discovered we did 
not make the payment to Mr. Erickson, they filed a grievance on his 
behalf.'

Cwayna says the decision to not pay the convicted child molester was his, but would not give a specific reason as to why.

'That was something I as superintendent, with some consultation with the president of the board,' decided, Cwayna said. 'That was a decision the superintendent makes and at this point … I prefer not to get into the reasons.'

However, as EAG News notes, the reasons not pay Erickson the severance 'seems pretty obvious.'
