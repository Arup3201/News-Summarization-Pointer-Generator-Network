At first glance a high glamour glossy fashion shoot, these pictures soon reveal themselves to be so much more.

The opulent jewellery dripping off the model’s ears are in fact diamond encrusted hearing aids, and several of the shots also show the model leaning on elaborately decorated walking aids.

The project, called Tools of Life, is the work of ethical artist Elana Langer and photographer Hanna Agar, both from New York, and aims to challenge the stigma and social discomfort of disability.

Not only a stunning and extravagant fashion statement, these dripping diamonds conceal a functional hearing aid

Artist Elana Langer both models in the shoot and designed and made the glamourous walkers and hearing aids

The pair decided to have the project in natural situations such as hailing a cab, in a hair salon or trying on lingerie, but with a glamorous twist

On the projects blog, Elana, who runs ethical company ‘What I live by’, says: ‘One tool of enhancement, like clothing or jewellery, doesn’t have to compromise another tool of enhancement like the ability to hear or walk with greater ease. They are both enriching our experiences in the world'.

Elana, who hand crafted all the hearing aids and walkers for the project, was inspired by her own grandmother, who resisted using such aids because of the connotations associated with them.

‘I don’t remember a time when her hair and nails weren’t done and she wasn’t dressed impeccably. In the last year of her life she, like many others in her condition, lost the ability to walk without support.

'And although she had a strong will to live, the idea of using a walker in public seemed unbearable to her. The force of her vanity had come up against the limit of the body.

I loved my grandmother deeply and I miss her in this world and I hope these pictures would make her smile.'

Posing herself in the project, the pair decided to have the project in natural situations such as hailing a cab, in a hair salon or trying on lingerie, but with a glamorous twist.

Although Elana doesn't actually use a hearing aid or a walker she wanted to embody the idea and channel the elegance of her grandmother.

The decorated and embellished hearing aids and walkers can be available on special order

Photographer Hanna Agar, from New York, collaborated on the project.

Speaking to MailOnline Hanna says: ‘I chose to do this project because the moment Elana mentioned it to me I could just imagine this world where all these people were walking around with blinged out walkers, just rocking it down the street.

‘And having hearing aids be just as beautiful as earrings; it felt like a celebration of life and what we can do, instead of a chore and embarrassment and a reminder of what we lack.

‘I love creating photographs that have a deeper message than just being a pretty picture, which was why this project really spoke to me.

The hearing aids and walkers can be available on special order from freedom@whatiliveby.com.
