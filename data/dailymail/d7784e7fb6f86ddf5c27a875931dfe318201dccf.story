Barcelona gave Jeremy Mathieu and Marc-Andre ter Stegen their first starts but it was the wise old head of Xavi who rescued them against Nice.

The Spaniard came on in the second half to pull the strings and converted a penalty to make the score 1-1.

Xavi came extremely close to leaving Barcelona this summer, having been linked with moves to both the United States and Qatar, but eventually decided to see out the last year of his Barcelona deal - and having that experience around while the squad deals with huge changes could prove vital.

Luis Enrique's side had flown to France on Saturday morning after a week's training at St George's Park, to face opponents who are ready for the new season. Nice kick off their Ligue 1 campaign next weekend, but the Catalans still have three weeks to go before La Liga begins. 

Nice: Hassen (Cardinale 62): Puel (Palun 77), Genevois, Bodmer, Amavi; Mendy, Eysseric (Rafetraniaina 59), Hult (Benrahma 77); Pied (Honorat 59), Cvitanich (Maupay 59), Bautheac (Bosetti 76).

Goal: Cvitanich pen 21.

Booked: Pied.

Barcelona: Ter Stegen; Montoya (Patric 39), Pique (Bartra 46), Mathieu (Ie 61), Alba (Grimaldo 61); Busquets (Xavi 46), Iniesta (Rakitic 46), Sergi Roberto (Samper 46); Adama (Halilovic 46), Rafinha (Munir 46 (Sandro 76)), Pedro (Deulofeu 46).

Booked: Iniesta.

Goal: Xavi pen 67.

They were without Lionel Messi, Neymar, Javier Mascherano and Dani Alves for this clash, all of whom return to the fold on August 5.

Barcelona's second pre-season friendly, following their 1-0 win over Recreativo Huelva, featured a lot more of their stars with the Spanish players returning to action. 

Alex Song is still absent for family reasons, while star signing Luis Suarez is suspended. Instead, it was some of the other summer purchases who got the chance to appear at the Allianz Riviera.

Mathieu had a shaky start to his Barcelona career, with a couple of misplaced passes and then a foul on the edge of his own box. The Frenchman has plenty to prove at Barcelona with a €20million fee on his shoulders, a baffling amount for someone about to turn 31.

There is pressure on Ter Stegen too, who is expected to be the long-term successor to Victor Valdes. He remained calm, palming a low free-kick away and gathering a long shot with ease early on.

However, there was little he could do about the opening goal, when Gerard Pique gave away a penalty. The defender is coming off the back of a poor season and a worse World Cup and shoved over Dario Cvitanich in the box. It was a soft decision to give, but the player picked himself up and rifled it past Ter Stegen. The goalkeeper dived low to his right and got a hand to Cvitanich's effort but it was not enough.

Rafinha - brother of Thiago Alcantara - is also looking to impress this season, but started up front in an unfamiliar false nine role. He made way at half-time along with several of his team-mates as a new look side entered the fray.

Sporting director Andoni Zubizarreta hailed Mathieu for his immense pace when he was presented, but the defender was caught out by Valentin Eysseric and had to bring the midfielder down on the right. However it was also Mathieu who headed the resultant free-kick away - his extra height will be a boost for Barca at the back this season.

Barcelona were sloppy in the first-half, creating little until the minutes before the interval. Pedro hit the bar with a mis-hit cross, while a surging run from highly-rated youngster Adama Traore was rudely ended with a trip. Pedro cut the free-kick back to Jordi Alba, whose low drive was beaten away by Mouez Hassen.

Flawless technique: Andres Iniesta controls the ball brilliantly in front of Jeremy Pied in midfield

Sergio Busqets, having taken to the field for the first time in the No 5 shirt he inherited from retired captain Carles Puyol, made way for Xavi, Ivan Rakitic made his debut, replacing Iniesta.

Barcelona should have been level five minutes after the re-start, when Gerard Deulofeu pressured Nice into an error, but Munir El Haddadi fired straight at the goalkeeper when clean through.

The game began to open up more in the second half, with Barcelona looking a lot more incisive thanks to veteran midfielder Xavi. He played three sublime passes shortly after coming on, helping Barcelona look significantly more threatening.

It was the 34-year-old who pulled Barcelona level, after Munir was taken down in the box by Romain Genevois and the game's second penalty was awarded. Xavi sent Yoann Cardinale the wrong way from the spot, dispatching it into the left-hand side of the net.

They could have added a second a few minutes later, but Deulofeu was selfish and ended up being tackled at the end of a fantastic run. His decision making was the one aspect of his game which was lacking at Everton and he should have squared the ball to Munir. Instead Genevois stole in to sweep the ball away.

Sandro had an opportunity late on, curling the ball against the left-hand post in the 82nd minute from close range after Edgar Ie's sliced shot landed at his feet.

Enrique won't be too disappointed with the result, with his players still some time away from being fully fit and also without their star names. However, he will hope that the injury which forced Martin Montoya off in the first half is not too serious, and that the side have more fluency on Wednesday night. 

Next up for Barcelona are Italy's Napoli, who will be a far tougher proposition than Nice.
