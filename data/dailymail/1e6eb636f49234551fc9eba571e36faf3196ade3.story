NSA whistleblower Edward Snowden launched an extraordinary attack on his father today claiming he has 'misled' the media with 'false claims' about him, adding: '[He] doesn't represent me in any way'.

Snowden, whose whereabouts remain unknown, made the claim after his father, Lon, told US television he intended to travel to Russia to see his son at a secret date in the near future.

Snowden Snr's legal team claimed yesterday they no longer trust Glenn Greenwald, the Guardian journalist who broke the story, nor WikiLeaks, which was instrumental in helping the former CIA analyst flee US authorities in its wake.

He also alleged Greenwald had been touting the story around the international press in return for a seven-figure bounty, a claim the journalist says is 'defamatory'.

'None of them have been or are involved in my current situation, and 
this will not change in the future,' Snowden said in an email to the Huffington Post, referring to his father, his father’s lawyer Bruce Fein, and Fein's wife and spokeswoman Mattie Fein.

'I ask journalists to understand that they do not possess any special 
knowledge regarding my situation or future plans, and not to exploit the
tragic vacuum of my father's emotional compromise for the sake of 
tabloid news,' he added.

In the email, he also claimed he was 
working with 'an international team of some of the finest lawyers in the
world' to prepare his legal defence and rallied behind the journalists who 
have helped him.

He added: 'There is no conflict amongst myself and any of the individuals or organizations with whom I have been involved.'

Snowden roiled American intelligence agencies and upended US relations around the globe with his disclosures of highly classified programmes that allow the US to collect millions of pieces of data, including Americans' phone records.

The government has charged him with violations of the Espionage Act in federal court in Alexandria, Va.

Whistleblower: Snowden roiled American intelligence agencies and upended US relations around the globe with his disclosures of highly classified programmes that allow the US to collect millions of pieces of data, including Americans' phone records.

He had his American passport revoked in June and was recently
granted asylum by the Russian government after weeks in territorial 
limbo.

Earlier this week, Lon Snowden secured documents to visit his son in
Russia and plans to discuss how he could fight espionage charges.

Neither
he nor his attorney Bruce Fein have spoken directly with the 
former NSA analyst since he fled the United States and received asylum 
in Russia, they said.

But the father and lawyer also said they look 
forward to meeting with Edward Snowden to consider options for the 
leaker to return to the United States at some point.

'As
a father, I want my son to come home if I believe that the justice 
system ... is going to be applied correctly,' Lon Snowden said.
