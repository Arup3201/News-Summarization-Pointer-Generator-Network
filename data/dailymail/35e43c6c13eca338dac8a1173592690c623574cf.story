Prince Harry jetted into Emirati capital Abu Dhabi this afternoon clad in white jeans and ready to hit the polo field for a match in aid of his African charity, Sentebale.

The royal arrived at the Ghantoot Racing and Polo Club to play in the Sentebale Polo Cup, raising funds for the charity he set up in memory of his late mother to help children affected by HIV and AIDS in southern Africa.

Declining to pose for photographers as he was late, Harry was immediately ushered into a reception to chat to sponsors and VIP guests. Among them was former Spice Girl Geri Halliwell, who was accompanied by her new fiancée Formula 1 Red Bull boss Christian Horner.

She said she had known Prince Harry since he was 10 - after being introduced to the young prince by his father, Prince Charles, whom she famously once pinched on the bottom.

'I have met Prince Harry a few times,' said Ms Halliwell. 'I've seen him since he was about 10. I have seen him grow up. It is brilliant what he is doing with his life.

'It's all for a good cause. I think he is a great ambassador for showing people that we care and he's got great spirit and heart. I think he's brilliant. We are looking forward to serving him in action.'

The singer also revealed that she has been on a polo pony before and described them as 'amazing'. 'I want to say like a Ferrari...' she said, before sheepishly trailing off. 

'No don't say Ferrari, it's Red Bull!' her Formula 1 fiancee interjected with mock seriousness. Ms Halliwell continued: 'Actually they are brilliant to handle. They are really light to the touch. But I've never actually been to a game to watch. '

Also at the reception was the Duke of Argyll, global ambassador for the distillery Royal Salute, the main sponsor of the event, and Dan Stevens, the former Downton Abbey actor.

The Duke explained: 'Dan is here as a guest of ours, and came over from New York for the event. I got to know him because they filmed the 2012 Christmas Special of Downton Abbey at my home, Inveraray Castle in Argyll.

'We’re very proud to be here supporting the Prince and Sentebale, as we have done for the past four years.'

He also explained that because of the ban on alcohol advertising in the United Arab Emirates, Prince Harry’s team could not play under its usual name of Royal Salute, and was instead being called the Huntsman team, after the Savile Row tailor which is another of the sponsors.

Also among the VIP guests was the former racing driver Sir Jackie Stewart, who said he had never tried playing polo because 'anything less than 500 horsepower is dangerous'.

Prince Harry, who has tried his hand at open cockpit racing on private visits to racing tracks, thanked Sir Jackie for sending him a crash helmet, and said a letter of thanks was on its way to him.

He told Sir Jackie: 'I like what you did with it', before pointing to Sir Jackie’s trademark tartan trousers and adding: 'At least you didn’t do that with it.'

The two men also chatted about whether polo players or racing drivers lost the most weight through perspiration while competing. 'I would lose six or seven pounds during a race,' Sir Jackie said, 'but in those days the races only lasted about an hour and 50 minutes.'

Sir Jackie also said he expected fellow Briton Lewis Hamilton to win the Abu Dhabi Formula 1 Grand Prix - and with it the world title - on Sunday.

Sentebale - which means forget me not - supports children in Lesotho, a tiny, poverty-stricken kingdom in southern Africa with one of the highest HIV/AIDS rates in the world.

Life expectancy for men and women in the kingdom is just 41 years, one in three children are orphans and there are believed to be more than 40,000 adolescents living with HIV.

The Prince plans to stay on in Abu Dhabi privately after today's polo to watch the Formula 1 Grand Prix at the Yas Marina Circuit this weekend. He has spent the last thee days in Oman on a semi-official royal visit at the personal invitation of the country's Sultan.

Harry's team eventually won the Sentebale Polo Cup 5-4, with the prince scoring at least one goal. He was also awarded the most valuable player of the match trophy.
