Neymar has had to entertain himself in a lengthy spell of recuperation after his injury at the World Cup.

So what better way to raise the stakes than with a huge stack of poker chips?

The Brazil and Barcelona star posted a selfie to his Instagram account behind a load of chips, with the message: 'all in?'

All in? Neymar posted the selfie on Instagram after his World Cup heartache in Brazil

He even had a little good-luck charm with him - a mini figurine of himself.

Neymar's clearly a fan of poker as it's the second snap he's posted, the first being a group shot.

Neymar was ruled out of his country's dismal final two matches at their home tournament after injuring his back in the quarter-final against Colombia.

His side went on to be humiliated 7-1 against eventual champions Germany before limping to a 3-0 defeat in the third-place play-off against Holland.

Neymar will link up with new striker Luis Suarez at Barcelona, with the Spanish media reporting that he'll form a partnership with the Uruguayan, with talisman Lionel Messi playing in the No 10 role.
