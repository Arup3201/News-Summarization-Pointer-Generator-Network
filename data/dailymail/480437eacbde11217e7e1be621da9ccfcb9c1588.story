A Florida mother says she's cracked her son's murder case eight years after his death was deemed an accident.

Judy Weaver worked tirelessly to get to the bottom of what happened on the rainy June day in 2005 when her son Ronnie Johnson, 34, was fatally injured. She was told he died after falling off his bike and hitting his head on a curb but that explanation didn't add up.

This week, thanks to her detective work, Jason Gailey, has been arrested and charged with Johnson's murder. Police now say he struck Johnson in the head with a handgun when he tried to stop a fight. The impact saw the man fall to the ground and hit the concrete.

'I'm just kind of numb. I'm very much relieved,' Weaver told ABC News.

Eyewitness accounts that are now considered to be false claimed Johnson died after he was doing tricks on his bike and slipped, hitting his head on the curb.

But Weaver inspected the bike and saw no scratches or damage, and also learned there was no curb in the area that her son could have slammed his head against.

Suspicious, Weaver managed to pinpoint Gailey as a suspect just days after the incident, while her son was still clinging to life in a coma.

Weaver and her daughter, Deborah 
Murray, spread the word that Johnson was recovering in hospital and 
giving details about what actually happened.

'This is how we got people to talk... Ronnie didn't actually speak to anybody,' Weaver told ABC News.

Nine days later, he was taken off life support and passed away on July 6, 2005.

But the ploy worked and Weaver got a partial confession from Gailey who admitted to hitting Johnson with his fist, though he said it was an accident.

He added that 'Ronnie was getting back up to beat him up, so he ran.'

'I think he was trying to deflect, pinning all fault on the others,' Murray said.

Weaver went straight to the police with the information but they refused to believe her son's death may not have been an accident.

Determined not to give up, Weaver and Murray carried on their own investigation for the next eight years, keeping careful notes.

'We worked good as a team,' Weaver 
said. She said once she had done the leg work, Murray helped 
her find the names, numbers, and locations, necessary to piece it all together.

But
the break they needed came in June 2012 when Lt. Paul 'Spike' Hopkins, a
detective in her son's case, came into the Chik-fil-A restaurant where 
Weaver was working.

Murder: Gailey, pictured left and right, has been charged with second degree murder. He has yet to be arraigned and has not entered a plea

Relief: Weaver is relieved that her tireless detective work has paid off and Gailey will be tried

Without realizing who he was, she began talking about her son's case to the officer, stirring his interest and the investigation was soon reopened.

'I knew if we got the right people, eventually it would be solved. It's getting the right person and eight years later, we got that right person,' Weaver told ABC News. 'I never gave up.'

Now with the cold case reopened, police determined that the witnesses who said they saw Ronnie fall off his bike had changed their stories.

One critical witness had suffered a stroke in the intervening years, and the health scare compelled him to come forward with the truth, feeling he owed it to himself and his family.

Police now say there was a fight between Gailey and another man identified as Harry 'Cowboy' Taylor and Johnson was trying to stop it when Gailey struck him in the head with a handgun and fell to the ground, hitting the concrete.

'My son was a good Samaritan and he lost his life,' Weaver said. 'If he had to lose his life, I'm proud he lost his life doing a good thing. I think he is looking down on us and just so proud that we never gave up, that we got to the bottom of this. I feel him around me, and when I see him again, we will rejoice.'

Gailey has been charged with second degree murder. He has yet to be arraigned and has not entered a plea.
