A crew member of long-running reality TV show 'Cops' has died after getting shot during filming last night.

The as-yet unidentified crew member was holding a microphone during the filming of a gun-fight with an armed robber in Omaha, Nebraska.  

The robber also died in the incident, in which officers fired an estimated 30 shots.

It was later revealed that the suspect, a parolee from Kansas, was actually carrying an Airsoft rifle which only looks like a firearm.

Police are expected to speak more about the deadly incident in a press conference at 2:30pm.

Scene of the shoot-out: Wendy's restaurant at the corner of 43rd and Dodge Street, Omaha, Nebraska - where a 'Cops' cameraman was shot and an armed robber was killed during a gun-fight last night

The shoot-out unfolded after police patrol cars responded to a back-up call in relation to a raid taking place at a Wendy's restaurant in Omaha, Nebraska, just after 9pm. 

In an audio of the police radio call posted by @MeanStreetsOMA on Soundcloud, an officer can be heard describing a suspect in a 'black hoodie and a white bandana' and additional patrol cars are dispatched to the location.  

At one point a male voice reports: 'We have one of the 'Cops' guys has been hit by gunfire; we need a squad here now.' Another male voice then urges 'we need multiple squads, two squads'.

A short time later, a man says: 'We've got a 'Cops' cameraman hit, white male, he's not conscious, he's slightly breathing.'

Speaking about the injured cameraman, Deputy Police Chief David Baker said: 'We will have more on his condition, as well as any other details on this tomorrow. 

Suspect killed: The armed raider, said to be wearing a  black hoodie and white bandana was shot in the incident and later pronounced dead by police

'We have a lot of ground to cover here tonight and officers will continue the investigation throughout the night.' 

Cops, created by US film and TV director John Langley, was first aired in 1989 and follows police officers and federal agents on patrols as well as on special operations such as vice and narcotics stings.

It describes itself as 'one of the first and only true and unscripted reality shows.'

The program, which has been filming in Omaha since July, was broadcast on Fox for 25 years before moving to Spike TV last year.

In June Omaha Police Chief Todd Schmaderer explained that he wanted Cops to film his department in action to put 'the professionalism of our officers on display for the city and the world to see', according to the World Herald. 

Langley Productions has so far been unavailable for comment.

It is not the first time that Spike TV has been been caught up in controversy.

In June, Carlos Enrique Barron, 43, was jailed for 90 days for firing two shots into the air outside his Las Vegas home in an apparent attempt to scare off a TV crew from reality show 'Repo Games' - also produced by Spike TV.

The program involves offering a vehicle owner the chance to prevent their car from being repossessed by answering five general knowledge questions correctly - at which point the show pays off their debts.
