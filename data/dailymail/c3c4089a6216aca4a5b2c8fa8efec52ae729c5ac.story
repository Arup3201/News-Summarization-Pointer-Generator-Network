An American deep sea treasure hunter claims he has found the body of Osama Bin Laden - and plans to visit the spot because he 'doesn't have enough proof' the Al Qaeda leader is really dead.

Bill Warren, 60, claims to have found the exact spot in the Northern Arabian Sea where the terrorist leader was dumped into the ocean by U.S. forces after being killed in a raid one year ago.

Mr Warren, who is now trying to raise over $200,000 for a mission to dive for Bin Laden's body bag, says the Al Qaeda leader is buried around 200 miles west of the Indian city of Surat.

He claims that as the Navy apparently weighed down Bin Laden's body when they gave him an ocean burial hours after his death, his corpse has not moved from its position on the ocean floor.

Mr Warren, who says he has found more than 200 shipwrecks during his treasure hunting career, pinpointed the location after studying satellite images given to him by a source at the Pentagon.

The marine explorer is aiming to start his mission towards Bin Laden's body at the start of June, and that he may be able to find the body in 'under a week'.

Mr Warren told Spanish newspaper El Mundo his search could also take up to three months, and that his biggest fear is being killed or sunk by the U.S. government.

He said: 'I've located where it was thrown. I'm the only one with this information. It's 200 miles to the west of the Indian city of Surat.

'He's at the bottom of the ocean and the soldiers put weights on him.'

Mr Warren had announced his plans to search for the location last June, a year after Bin Laden was killed by U.S. Navy Seals during a raid on his compound in Abbottabad, Pakistan.

The explorer told TMZ at the time he 'dosn't trust the government' of President Obama that the remains are actually those of the Taliban leader.

Bin Laden was disposed of overboard the USS Carl Vinson in the North Arabian sea following DNA tests, but Mr Warren remains unconvinced and wants to conduct the DNA tests himself.

The warship received a SEAL team that carried Bin Laden's body after killing him in a raid on his walled compound in Abbottabad, Pakistan.

His body was placed in a 'weighted bag', an officer made religious remarks and he was put on a flat board and tipped into the sea, the Pentagon said.

Mr Warren began diving commercially in 1972 and has ran several salvage companies since then, according to his website.

The treasure hunter is currently in Afghanistan, on what he says is a contract with the nation's government to explore the Caspian Sea for shipwrecks.

He said at the time: 'We do this because we are patriotic Americans and feel that President Obama failed to provide the proof.'

The exact location of Bin Laden's body has never been revealed, partly to prevent the area becoming a shrine for Islamic extremists.
