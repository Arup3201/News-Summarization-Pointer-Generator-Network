The average house price in the South is now more than twice as high as in the North, a study has revealed.

It is thought to be the first time that the North/South gap has widened to this extent.

Despite widespread economic gloom, experts say that asking prices across London, the South-East, South-West and East Anglia rose by 4.7 per cent last month.

However, prices in the North and North-West, the West and East Midlands, Yorkshire and the Humber and Wales fell by 0.7 per cent.

The typical property in the South now costs £336,743, compared with £164,347 in the North. The £172,396 gap is the largest recorded in the nine-year history of property firm Rightmove’s pricing index.

Property prices had been predicted to 
fall by as much as ten per cent by 2013 due to the challenging financial
climate, but Rightmove said the South, and London in particular, 
continues to exceed expectations.

In the four years since the start of the credit crunch, asking prices have fallen by 9.6 per cent in the North - but jumped 5.4 per cent in the South.

Rising house prices in the South are pricing many would-be buyers out of the market

Rightmove spokesman Miles Shipside said: ‘Wider access to mortgages and rising asking prices are early signs of increasing demand, giving homeowners some grounds for hope of a market recovery.’

However, he added that the reality was a ‘two-tier’ market with a ‘growing price gap’. The firm’s report suggested high unemployment in the North had driven prices down.

■ A mansion put on sale for £70million six years ago is reported to have finally come under offer - for less than half the original asking price.

Surrey’s Updown Court - also known as Bling Towers – boasts five swimming pools, a heated marble driveway, a bowling alley and escape tunnels.

A foreign businessman is said to  have offered almost £35million for the 103-room property.
