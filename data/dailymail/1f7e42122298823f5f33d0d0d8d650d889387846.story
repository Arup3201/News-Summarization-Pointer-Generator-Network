Lionel Messi was Barcelona's 'Golden Boy' once again as he closed in on Raul's Champions League scoring record with two goals in their win over Ajax on Wednesday night.

The Argentine master was lauded on the front cover of Thursday's Mundo Deportivo newspaper, who ran with the headline 'Golden Messi'.

And Sport, another Catalan publication, called him 'King of Europe' on their front page.  

Lionel Messi has equalled Raul's Champions League goalscoring record of 71 after two against Ajax

Messi was very much the 'Golden' boy on the front cover of Mundo Deportivo, the Catalan sports daily

Sport labelled him the 'King of Europe' after he equalled Raul's Champions League goalscoring record

It looks as though Cristiano Ronaldo - on 70 goals - could be beaten to the record by his rival Messi

Joint 1st: Lionel Messi (Barcelona) - 71 goals; Raul (Real Madrid, Schalke) - 71

2nd: Cristiano Ronaldo (Manchester United, Real Madrid) - 70

3rd: Ruud van Nistelrooy (PSV Eindhoven, Manchester United, Real Madrid) - 56

4th: Thierry Henry (Monaco, Arsenal, Barcelona) - 50

He now has 71 goals in Europe's elite competition, the same number as the former Real Madrid striker. Messi has achieved the tally in 90 matches, while Raul needed 142.

Cristiano Ronaldo, who failed to get on the scoresheet in Real's 1-0 win over Liverpool on Tuesday, is one goal behind with 70 in 107 matches.

Messi looks likeliest to beat Raul's record as Barcelona play APOEL Nicosia on November 25, a day before Real Madrid take on Basle.

His double in the Amsterdam ArenA was enough to secure a 2-0 victory and book Barcelona a place in the last 16.

Messi has scored a total of six goals against Arsenal in the Champions League - including four in one game
