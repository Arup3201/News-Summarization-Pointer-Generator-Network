The ex-boyfriend to the mother of a 15-year-old girl found stabbed to death in a ‘fit of rage’ in her bedroom has confessed to her tragic death

Police say Juan Enrique Torres, 41, submitted a written confession on Thursday, two days after Surie Baeza was found by her mother laying in a pool of blood in her Rockwall, Texas home.

'...he started talking, and it took several hours over the interview, where he finally admitted to the detectives and made a written confession that he did, in fact, kill Surie,' Police Sgt. Jeff Welch told WFAA. ‘Somewhere along the process, he said he wanted to come clean.’

Confession: Juan Enrique Torres admitted to police he had murdered his ex-girlfriend's daughter Surie Baeza

Torres, the father of Surie's seven-year-old sibling but otherwise unrelated, had recently moved out of their home after living with the family for at least eight years, WFAA reports.

It was on Tuesday afternoon while the young teen stayed home from school after feeling sick the pair got into an argument, he said.

Arguing about money, Torres confessed to succumbing to a 'fit of rage' which only escalated when Surie threatened to call 911.

Taking a knife from the kitchen, he told police he followed the girl back to her room where he attacked her.

Found by her mother Irma once returning home from work, the girl suffered multiple stab wounds with an autopsy revealing her attempt to defend herself.

Having sent a text message around 2pm, police estimate the attack occurring between then and 4.30pm.

'We had interviewed him before,' Sgt Welch told the Dallas Morning News. 'He had been cooperative.'

Emotional: The popular girl's friends were struck with grief when they discovered she had been killed

Torres had been previously arrested for domestic violence while at the time of his confession Dallas Morning News reports him having been booked in the Rockwall County Jail on Wednesday for traffic charges that included driving with a suspended license.

'She was just one of the sweetest people I've ever met,' one of Surie's friends David Harvey told CBS DFW. 'It was just one of those things where you would never expect it to happen to her of all people.'

A high school freshman who played flute in her school's band, Surie was only two days into her 15th birthday when she died.
