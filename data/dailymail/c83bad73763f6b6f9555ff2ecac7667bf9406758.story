A yet-to-air reality show documenting a rapper, who has fathered eleven children by ten different women, has been slammed by critics who have branded it 'disgusting' and 'negative'.

All My Babies' Mamas, set to air this spring on the Oxygen network, follows Carlos 'Shawty Lo' Walker, 36, as he navigates family life in an affluent suburb of Atlanta, Georgia.

But after a preview of the one-hour, fly-on-the-wall hit the internet thousands of viewers called for it to be scrapped, with many suggesting it plays on racial stereotypes.

A Change.org petition, which has more than 20,000 signatures, states that the show 'stereotypes and demeans black children, mothers and dads'.

New York-based Sabrina Lamb, who launched the initiative explains: 'This is not just an attack on African-American parents and children....but all parents and children.

'As dysfunctional and violent as so-called reality shows are, could you ever imagine a one hour spectacle where 11 children are forced to witness their 10 unwed mothers clamor for financial support, emotional attention and sexual reward from Shawty-Lo, the apathetic ‘father’?'

Oxygen released a 13-minute trailer promoting the show in December, before production had been completed.

Relationship history: E'creia, who gave birth to Mr Walker's first child, explained: 'He might be known as a rapper, but here in Atlanta he¿s known for having eleven kids and ten baby mamas.'

In the clip, which has has now disappeared from YouTube, Mr Walker is seen talking about managing his music career and the struggle of being a father from the confines of his roomy eight-bedroom mansion.

'How does a guy like me have ten baby mamas eleven kids? It’s heaven,' he boasts in one scene.

'I had a lot of girls... They was in love and, I probably was too. And it just happened'

And in another he explains: 'I had a lot of girls... They was in love and, I probably was too. And it just happened.'

The trailer also shows him as he fails to remember the names of his eleven teenage children.

In an interview with Essence about her 
petition Ms Lamb said: 'In the clip I saw, Lo couldn't even remember the
 names of all of his 11 children. This is not funny to me. What's funny 
about this?'

E'creia, who gave birth to Mr Walker's first child and refers to herself as 'The First Lady', introduces the other women who have also had flings with the music star.

In the spotlight: Carlos Walker, better known by his stage name Shawty Lo, released his first solo rap album in 2008, but away from the music scene he is busy being a father to 11 children

The mother-of-one gives all of her fellow 'baby mamas' nicknames, such as 'jealous', 'the baby mama from hell' or 'shady baby mama'.

So far, just seven of Shawty Lo's ten 'baby mamas' have been named - and each been given her own on-show nickname...

Mr Walker's new girlfriend, who is the same age as one of his oldest children, also features in the show.

The scantily-clad Ashlin, who will turn 20 this year, tells viewers: 'Me and Carlos have been dating for about a year now and I’m really in love with him.'

Many of the other baby mamas believe she will soon fall pregnant.

After a trailer promoting All My Babies' Mamas was released, a stream of negative comments flooded social media sites.

One YouTube user wrote: 'This show is disgusting we don't need role models like this bunch.'

While
 another commented on Facebook: 'This is horrible! Pls dont show this! 
How about a show that will help rebuild our nation instead of 
glamourizimg the NEGATIVE?'

Despite public outcry, Oxygen has defended its new show.

In a statement it said: 'Oxygen’s 
one-hour special in development is not meant to be a stereotypical 
representation of everyday life for any one demographic or cross-section
 of society.

On to the next one: A clip for the now scrapped show All My Babies' Mamas showed rapper Mr Walker in bed with his 19-year-old girlfriend Ashlin

'It is a look at one unique family 
and their complicated, intertwined life… Oxygen Media’s diverse team of 
creative executives will continue developing the show with this point of
 view.'

The network previously explained in a press release that the show 'will capture the highs and lows of this extreme
 ‘blended family’ that is anything but ordinary, while also showing the 
drama and the passion behind life’s most unexpected situations.'

It said viewers could expect 
'outrageous and authentic over-the-top moments that our young, diverse 
female audience can tweet and gossip about.'

All My Babies' Mamas, said to still be in production, is set to air this spring.

The program's executive producers are Liz Gateley and Tony DiSanto of DiGa Vision, who also worked on MTV reality shows Laguna Beach, The Hills and Teen Mom.
