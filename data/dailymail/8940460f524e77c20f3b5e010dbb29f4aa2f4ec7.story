When a pole dancing society opened at a university, dozens of women signed up to get fit.

But the club has now been  disbanded after Swansea University’s students’ union objected because of the pastime’s links  to the sex industry.

In a statement, it said: ‘Activities such as pole fitness contributes to an atmosphere where women are viewed as sexual objects  and where violence against them is acceptable.

‘Evidence shows that young women aged 16 to 24 are the group who experience the most domestic and sexual violence.

The Swansea Student Pole Fitness Society was initially allowed to become an official society of the union, but the decision was later revoked

'This is the age of a large group of 
our female students. This activity is inextricably linked to the 
multi-million-pound sex industry and upholds and bolsters sexist 
attitudes and behaviours.’

The Pole Fitness Society was due to hold twice-weekly sessions before the union intervened.

Club
 president Beth Morris said: ‘Lap dancing occurs in gentlemen’s clubs. 
Pole fitness is strictly for fitness. Since the classes are purely for 
fitness, there is therefore no link between it and the sex industry.’

Heidi Muir, its treasurer, added: ‘There are union societies that encourage binge drinking and have done naked calendars.

‘But a fitness class which encourages a healthy lifestyle, body confidence and self-esteem doesn’t fit into these policies.’
