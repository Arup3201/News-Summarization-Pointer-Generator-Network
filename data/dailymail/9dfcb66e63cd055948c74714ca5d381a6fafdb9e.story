The two Austrian teenage girls who became ‘poster girls’ for jihad in Syria are now desperate to come home after getting completely disillusioned with their new lifestyles.

Samra Kesinovic, 17, and her friend Sabina Selimovic, 15, who grew up in the Austrian capital Vienna, were persuaded to head to Syria and take part in the holy war in April.

The girls had started lecturing schoolmates about their lifestyle and when they left Vienna in April they left behind a note telling their parents: 'Don’t look for us. We will serve Allah – and we will die for him'.

Once they arrived it is believed they were married off to local fighters and both the girls are thought to be pregnant.

Police in their homeland Austria say that the girls' social media accounts were taken over and manipulated to broadcast what they now think were fake messages about the life they were having, and using them as poster girls to encourage other young girls to head to Syria.

But
 security service insiders have told Austrian media that the girls have 
managed to contact their families to say they have had enough, and want 
to come home.

However
 they warn that there is almost now no chance that they will be able to 
leave their new lives after they became internationally famous and the 
images were shared all round the world.

Austrian
 newspaper Oesterreich, which revealed that the girls now wanted to come
 home, is known to have close connections to those investigating the 
disappearance of the two girls and is in close contact with their 
families.

Both sets of parents had been trying to find ways to contact their daughters and it is believed some way of communicating had been established.

The
 paper said that the girls are currently in the Islamic State controlled
 city of Rakka in northern Syria, had been married to Chechen fighters 
upon their arrival in Syria and were both pregnant.

Spokesman for the Interior Ministry, Karl-Heinz Grundboeck, said however that decision may be too late.

He said: 'The main problem is about people coming back to Austria. Once they leave it is almost impossible.'

The news comes despite reports which surfaced last month that one of the girls may have been killed.

However, these reports were never officially confirmed and the Interior Ministry could not ascertain if they were correct.

The
 motivations of the two Bosnian girls are unclear but before leaving, 
they had contact with Chechen youths, and visited a mosque in Vienna's 
second district.

And
 police also expressed concerns that the pair were inspiring their 
contemporaries after two other teenage girls were caught attempting to 
flee the country to join IS ranks.

Little information was given about the copycat
 pair hoping to join Islamic State apart from the fact that one was 16 
and the other was 14 and their parents were apparently from Iraq.

Police
 now want to find out how they became radicalised, and whether anybody 
had helped them plan their trip to Syria which was apparently set to 
take place via Turkey - following the same route as the other two girls.

The
 pair were caught when the mother of a third friend who was supposed to 
be travelling with them became suspicious about the amount of luggage 
her daughter was packing.

As many as 130 people from Austria are now believed to be fighting as jihadists abroad.

More than half of Austrian's jihadists originally come from the Caucasus region and have a valid residence permit in Austria.
