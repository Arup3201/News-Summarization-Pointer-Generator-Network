Tottenham need their plans for a new stadium to be approved if they wish to keep up with the Premier League's top sides, according to Arsenal boss Arsene Wenger.

Spurs revealed it was 'highly unlikely' their plans for a proposed 56,000-seater ground adjacent to White Hart Lance will be completed ahead of the 2017-18 season, following a legal challenge by one of the landowners. 

Asked if Mauricio Pochettino's side needed their new stadium to keep up with the league's elite teams, Wenger replied: 'Financially, for sure. You cannot be in a business where you turn down 15,000 or 20,000 people every week. If your competitors have more financial power than you, at some stage you have to make a decision.

Arsene Wenger believes Tottenham need the money a new stadium would bring in order to keep up

'It looks like everybody makes this decision now, because when you look at Liverpool, Everton, [they] want to increase their capacity. West Ham go to a bigger stadium next season so if you stay in a smaller capacity, it's even more difficult.'

Arsenal went through a similar ordeal 15 years ago, as work on the 60,272-seater Emirates was delayed until 2004, before the Gunners made the switch from Highbury two years later. 

'I just think it's much more difficult today,' said Wenger, 'because we built our stadium at a price that you couldn't afford it anymore. We managed to build our stadium by subsidising it with our own resources. That is much more difficult today.'

Arsenal's improved financial position as a result of their Emirates move has allowed them to spend big on players like Germany international Mesut Ozil, who signed from Real Madrid in 2013 for a fee of £42.5million

The delay to Tottenham's plans means they will need to find a temporary home for one season while the stadium is built.

A number of venues have been mooted - including stadium:mk in Milton Keynes.

One option that has been emphatically ruled out is the Olympic Stadium.West Ham vice-chairman Karren Brady has said Spurs would be barking up the wrong tree if they asked for permission to share the ground, which the Hammers are due to move into in 2016.
