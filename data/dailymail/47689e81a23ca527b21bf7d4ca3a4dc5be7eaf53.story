The death of Julia Roberts' half-sister in February was a suicide, coroner's officials said today.

An
 autopsy and toxicology tests determined that Nancy Motes drowned in a 
bathtub after taking several drugs that have not yet been publicly 
identified.

Los Angeles 
coroner's spokesman Craig Harvey said the drugs will be listed in a full
 autopsy report that could be released as early as next week.

Harvey said 37-year-old Motes left behind a suicide note and that it will be turned over to her family.

Motes was the younger sister of actress Julia Roberts and actor Eric Roberts.

A
 receptionist for Julia Roberts' publicist, Marcy Engelman, said 
Engelman was out of the country and unavailable to comment and that no 
one else was available.

The coroner's official ruling comes a week-and-a-half after Roberts gave a eulogy at her half-sister's memorial service.

Witnesses said the superstar had some 'harsh' and 'bizarre' words for Nancy Motes on May 3, according to the National Enquirer, and shocked mourners as she let loose all the anger she felt toward her sister whose suicide note detailed their strained relationship.

The source said: 'Julia said that, as her sister, she just wanted to "wring" her neck because she didn't wait to see the joy that comes with the morning.'

Nancy Motes' ashes were buried in a local ceremony on Saturday attended by a small group of relatives and friends including mom Betty Lou

The already shocked mourners 'were even more stunned when she said that she actually admired Nancy for what she did' the source revealed.

She said her sister 'took control and ended her pain when she had no other tolls to cope with it...She said that she admired that she had the strength to do what she did, to end her pain,' said the source.

The revelations is one of many to come out of the memorial for Motes. The previous involved Motes' grieving fiance's insistence that Roberts never should have been there in the first place.

And he wasn't even invited to the Smyrna, Georgia gathering.

'Just so you all know "America's Sweetheart" is a B----!!' Days before her suicide, Nancy went on a Twitter rant against the three-time Golden Globe winner, whom she claimed fat-shamed her

Grief: John Dilbeck, seen here with late fiancee Nancy Motes, claims he wasn't even invited to her funeral on Saturday

John Dilbeck, the fiance, told RadarOnline that he, along with many of Motes' friends, were not invited to the funeral held in Smyrna, Georgia.

'It really hurts,' he told the website. 'I was very frustrated and hurt by it. I needed to voice being hurt, because Nancy's voice is being silenced.'

Motes would not have even wanted Roberts at the ceremony, Dilbeck said.

'No one was really expecting it, but Julia gave a little speech at one point during the ceremony,’ a source told MailOnline of the star's eulogy.

Roberts has been hit with harsh criticism since Motes died from a drug overdose in February, but on Saturday, she showed her true feelings by attending the hour and twenty minute service in the blazing Georgia heat.

Prayers: Julia walked arm in arm with her mother Betty Lou as they were blessed at a Los Angeles church in April. There was no church service for Nancy, as friends say she was not very religious

With the rest of the mourners already assembled, the Oscar winner pulled up in a white SUV with her mom, her sister Lisa and a driver.

Wearing a black dress, a beige cardigan, beige handbag and black over-sized sunglasses, she jumped out of the car and tightly hugged friends and family.

After greeting all of the other guests, she made her way down to the shaded burial area, covered with a green tent, helping her elderly mother, 79, who is battling cancer. Brother Eric Roberts was not spotted at the ceremony.

The devastated pair then took their position at the front of the congregation.

After the ceremony, Julia, 46, was one of the last to leave the New Symrna Cemetery, staying back to casually chat with old friends who she hadn’t seen in years.

Julia embraced and comforted a number of other mourners, before getting back into the SUV and heading to a nearby hotel for a low key wake, where she also said a few words.

Final trip: Nancy was found dead with prescription and 'illegal drugs' near her and left behind a five-page letter describing her difficult relationship with Julia. She was cremated in Los Angeles after her death and her ashes were sent to Smyrna

'She kept it brief, but it was absolutely heartfelt and very moving': Julia returned to her Smyrna, Georgia hometown on April 11 for the memorial service and gave a 'harsh' and 'bizarre' eulogy
