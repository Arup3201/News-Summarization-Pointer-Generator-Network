In a dazzling blaze of orange and black, three of the world's rarest tigers dash in to the outside world for the first time - after they were born in a British zoo.

The Sumatran Tiger cubs - two females and a male - are the first baby tigers to be born at Flamingo Land Zoo near Malton, North Yorkshire, in more than 20 years.

Playing in the great outdoors and nuzzling up to their proud mother, the eight-week-old infants add to a world population of the critically endangered species, which is estimated to be as low as 400.

Easy does it: One of the eight-week-old tiger cubs thinks about leaping off a rock as its mother watches. The young animals are still very much in their infancy and are still dependent on their mother

Zoo manager Ross Snipp has spoken of his pride at the popular zoo attraction helping to bring about a near one per cent increase in the species’ numbers.

Mr Snipp said: 'It was a fantastic feeling when the cubs were born, a real sense of joy.

'As a zoo, it doesn’t get much better than breeding a critically endangered species. This is what we are here for.

According to the World Wildlife Fund, there are now fewer than 400 Sumatran tigers left in the wild.

The tiger subspecies is classed as 'critically endangered' and they are holding on for survival in remaining patches of forest on the island of Sumatra.

Conservationists blame dwindling numbers on increased deforestation as well as continued poaching and the twin threats have sparked fears they could end up extinct.

Although they are protected by law in Indonesia, with tough sentences handed out for poaching and heavy fines, there is still a 'substantial' market for tiger parts and products within Sumatra and wider Asia.

Sumatran tigers weigh between 156 and 308 pounds and typically live in tropical areas of forest as well as peat swamp and freshwater swamp habitats.

'This has been seven years in the making and we are very proud to have delivered three healthy cubs.'

The cubs - born on March 22 to mother Surya and father Bawa - were released into their outside enclosure for the very first time.

At just eight weeks old, they are still very much in their infancy and still dependent on their mother for food.

produce offspring

One of the cubs receives a big lick from its proud mother as the pair relax in the grass. At this stage they are still feeding from their mother but over the last few weeks have learnt to move independently

Mr Snipp added: 'The cubs are still tiny compared to the size they will grow to and only weigh around seven kilos.

'At this stage they are still feeding from their mother but over the last few weeks have learnt to move independently and they are now all very active.'

The cubs’ parents arrived at Flamingo Land in 2010 in the hope that they would produce offspring as part of a worldwide conservation effort to save the Sumatran Tiger from extinction.

Surya and Mentari adopt the same position and look out in the same direction at their Flamingo Land enclosure. The world population of Sumatran Tigers is as low as 400

Mr Snipp added: 'These cubs are now the future of the European breeding programme.

'In 18 months time they could be transferred anywhere in Europe and hopefully paired with a suitable mate to continue the breeding process.'

The average life expectancy of Sumatran tigers in the wild is only four years, but the expected lifespan of Surya and Bawa is more than 20 years.
