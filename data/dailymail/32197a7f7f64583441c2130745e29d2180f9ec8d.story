It was thought to have died out over 50 years ago, but photographers have managed to snap an exceptionally rare lizard in Ecuador.

The long-nosed Pinocchio lizard was spotted by a team of photographers and researchers after combing a remote area in the north west of the country for three years.

The lizard, which was first discovered in 1953 and named after the fictional lying puppet, was thought to be extinct until 2005 and it has only been sighted three times since.

After searching for the rare long-nosed Pinocchio anole (pictured) for three years, a team of photographers and researchers found the lizard recently in a stretch of pristine cloud forest in the northwest part of Ecuador, around two hours drive from the capital

The lizard was named after Pinocchio (puppet, pictured), a fictional character whose nose grew each time he lied

The curious-looking animal did a disappearing act in the 1960s and was not seen again until an ornithologist saw one crossing the road in the same stretch of cloud forest.

The animal was most recently captured by Alejandro Arteaga, a co-founder of an eco-tourism company called Tropical Herping, which has been searching for the almost long-lost animal.

The researcher told LiveScience that the best time to spot the rare lizards known as anoles is at night when they are sleeping and less likely to run away.

As part of an expedition in January, one of his sharp-eyed team saw a male Pinocchio anole scaling a branch and the team managed to catch it and keep it overnight until they could photograph it in its natural surroundings the following morning.

Mr Arteaga said: 'After looking for so long It was very thrilling to find this strange lizard.'

The male lizard's long nose actually serves no real purpose apart from advertising its good genes and female anoles select their mates based on whether it has an impressive appendage.

The females do not have long noses.

The curious animal was discovered in 1953 but disappeared from the 1960s until it was spotted again in 2005. Since then, the endangered species has been seen just three times

The creatures are unsurprising 
endangered have have so far only been seen in four places - most of 
which are along the same stretch of road in north west Ecuador, 
according to the International Union for Conservation of Nature.

Mr Arteaga said the strange-looking anoles have one of the tiniest ranges out of all lizard species in the world.

He
and his colleagues set out specifically to find the Pinocchio lizard to
complete their book, 'THE AMPHIBIANS AND REPTILES OF MINDO' after it 
evaded them for so long.

The book details all the weird and wonderful amphibian and reptilian occupants of the region north of Ecuador's capital, Quito.
