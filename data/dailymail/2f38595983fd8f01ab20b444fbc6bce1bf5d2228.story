An expert skydiver in Michigan died on Saturday while practicing an extremely difficult method of flying.

Kenneth Ryan Bernek, 34, was trying to fly close to the ground at a maximum speed for a long distance before landing when he collided with a woman before hitting the ground.

The method of flying was called ‘high performance canopy flight’, commonly referred to as ‘swooping’.

Daredevil: Bernek was practicing a difficult method where divers fly very close to the ground for a long period of time at high speed

Expert: The skydiver, left, had around 1,800 dives under his belt and routinely filmed people's jumps

According to Randy Allison, the manager of Midwest Freefall Sport Parachute Club in Ray Township, where the fatal dive occurred, Bernek was diving too low.

‘The dive that he executed was a little too low and as a result he impacted the ground prematurely,’ Allison told the New York Daily News.

The woman was standing just outside the landing zone when she was hit and was taken to hospital for non-life threatening injuries.

The plane took off at 6:10 p.m. and the rest of the load went up 14,000 feet above ground for standard jumps but Bernek hopped out earlier — at 5,000 feet — to work on the dangerous technique.

Dangerous: Bernek hopped out of the plane at 5,000 feet, which is much closer to the ground than normal jumps at 14,000 feet above ground

Many years' experience: He had been jumping for 15 years when the tragic accident happened on Saturday

Bernek, who started jumping at Midwest Freefall in 2002, had about 1,800 dives under his belt over the past 15 years.

He already had his own equipment at this point so he just paid for the plane ride to altitude.

He became a videographer for the club and recorded others' dives with helmet-mounted cameras. He also started teaching tandem and solo flights.

‘He was a mentor to a lot of people here and a guy who always had a smile on his face… this saddened us greatly,’ said Allison.

Midwest Freefall has had no other serious injuries in its history, Allison said.

The club adheres to the licensing system defined by the United States Parachute Association, which outlines what manoeuvres an individual is allowed to perform.

'Very accomplished': The club's manager says Bernek was well-respected in the community

Bernek met all the requirements for an expert D license.

‘He was very accomplished and well-respected in the community and very well-credentialed,’ said Allison.

A friend's comment on Bernek's Facebook profile picture on August 11, which shows him doing the low-flying stunt, says: 'U look a little low...'

Bernek's answer was: 'That explains the hands on the brake toggles... ha'.
