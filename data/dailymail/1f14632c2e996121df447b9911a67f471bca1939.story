Residents across Australia are being warned to batten down the hatches with a severe weather warning bringing damaging winds.

The Bureau of Meteorology has issued destructive wind alerts for Western Australia, Victoria, South Australia, Tasmania as well as New South Wales.

Perth has already been the victim of ferocious winds following a destructive cold front that left up to 10,000 homes without power.

Thanks to the Perth Storm, damaging winds tip this light plane. 

A roof was ripped clearly off an apartment in Attadale, while one families trampoline went flying and a light plane didn't fair too well in the destructive winds, toppling over. 

The bureau issued a second warning and expects widespread damaging winds up to 125 kilometres per hour in Perth and parts of Western Australia.

As a result, it's predicted there could be damage to homes and property. 

It's reported that thunderstorms and small hail are also possible along southern coastal parts of Western Australia until early Tuesday, including dangerous surf conditions. 

Those down south will also get their fair share of windy weather, as a vigorous front moves across South Australia. 

The Bureau says Adelaide residents should prepare for gusts of up to 100 kilometres per hour.

Strong to near-gale northerly winds with gusts up to 90 kilometres per hour were reported at Cleve, Port Lincoln, Wudinna and Coles Point early on Monday.

'People affected should stay indoors and away from windows, move vehicles under cover and secure loose items,' the State Emergency Service said.

In Victoria it's much the same, with a high pressure system drifting eastwards across the Tasman sea, while a strong cold front crosses the bight. 

Residents are warned of strong to gale force northerly winds, which are expected to develop ahead of the front, with winds averaging 70 to 90 kilometres an hour on Tuesday.

There is also the possibility of damage to property.

In Tasmania, that cold front is approaching from the west and will cross the state  Tuesday morning with rain and flood warnings.

It's expected there will be damaging winds around 50 kilometres an hour with peak gusts of 100 kilometres per hour forecast.

The State Emergency Service and Tasmanian Police have advised that people should supervise children, manage pets and livestock, be prepared for a power outage and listen to the radio for any updates.

New South Wales has also received a  weather warning for damaging winds in the alps, although major cities shouldn't be affected.
