Pleased: During the visit, the Chinese President said he 'cherished' his 'sound relationship' with Barack Obama

And it has been deemed a great success - with Chinese media celebrating a budding
 relationship between the pair.

Today, China News Service has described the First Lady as 'Mrs Diplomatic' - claiming she has transformed the official visit from a low-profile tour into a diplomatic success.

Meanwhile, Xinhua news agency has dubbed the trip 'an unprecendented and historical moment in the chapter of China-U.S. relations'.

Other news services, such as The Global Times, have published articles comparing the two First Ladies' fashion preferences, including their favourite designers.

As well as visiting the state guesthouse,
 Mrs Obama strolled through the Forbidden City with the glamorous Ms 
Peng, an opera singer who has broken the mold of reticent, virtually 
invisible Chinese ladies. 

Prior to the trip, White House aides said
 they hoped the presence of Mrs 
Obama's daughters, Sasha and Malia, and her mother would resonate with 
Chinese families who value multi-generational activities.

'China
 views Mrs. Obama's trip most positively,' said Shen Dingli, professor 
of international relations at Fudan University in Shanghai.

'If she is 
humble and respectful, she will win the support from the Chinese public 
for building good relationships with the United States under the 
leadership of her husband.'

During the visit, President Xi told the 
First Lady he shared a close relationship with her husband, Barack Obama
 - saying: 'I cherish 
my sound working relationship and personal friendship I already 
established with your husband.

'We stay in close touch between phone conversations and correspondence.'

And
 Mrs Obama expressed a similar attitude towards the U.S. and China's relationship - saying: 'We have had a wonderful first
 day here in China.'

Although today's meeting was not on the First Lady's official itinerary, it is believed to have been expected.

'It
 is only logical for President Xi to meet her, because it is a matter of
 etiquette for the head of the household to meet the guest of his wife,'
 said Teng Jianqun, director of the American studies department at China
 Institute of International Studies.

He
 said Mrs Obama likely served as a messenger on behalf of President 
Barack Obama - adding: 'She made history as the first U.S. First Lady to
 visit China independently.'

Earlier in the day, Mrs Obama had toured a Beijing high school and former Imperial Palace.

She had also greeted 
students who were building robots and tried her hand at Chinese 
calligraphy at the Second High School Attached to Beijing Normal 
University in central Beijing.

The elite school has 33 American exchange
 students, and some of its Chinese students aspire to study in the 
U.S.

In a calligraphy class set up for 
Mrs Obama's visit, the First Lady practiced writing the Chinese 
character for 'eternal' under the guidance of 16-year-old student Lu 
Yuhong.

'I'm nervous,' Mrs. Obama said - to which, Mrs Peng replied in English: 'Don't be nervous'.

The First Lady was assisted by Peng Liyuan, left, the wife of Chinese President Xi Jinping, and 16-year-old high school pupil Lu Yuhong, right, who showed her how to write the Chinese character meaning 'eternity'

Speaking
 after the class, Lu also said he had been nervous, as well as 'very 
excited' - adding: 'But the First Lady was so amicable. She was very 
approachable.'

Among six American exchange students who attended the calligraphy class was Audrey Fritz, 17, who had come from the exclusive 
Sidwell Friends School in Washington.

'It's been an amazing experience,' Fritz said of her time in China. 'I have learned to be much more independent.'

In
 another class, students showed Mrs Obama small robots they had built - 
moving the devices with remote controls over piles of yellow plastic 
bricks.

'All the 
students that she met with, the Chinese students, spoke English and were
 able to explain to her in very fluent English what they were doing,' 
said Tina Tchen, Mrs. Obama's chief of staff.

'And
 I think she found that very impressive, because we know it's something 
that we struggle with in the United States, about having our kids be 
able to be fluent in a second language by the time they get to high 
school.'

Later in the morning, Mrs Peng went with Mrs. Obama to the former Imperial Palace in central Beijing, before attending a private dinner and a performance.

Tomorrow, 
the First Lady is due to speak at Peking University, where she is believed to be speaking on the importance of free exchange of ideas, before visiting the Great Wall on Sunday.

'I
 do think tomorrow she will talk about the value of the free exchange of
 ideas and the Internet, and how that, in her view, has made our country
 stronger; how even when you can be the object of criticism, as she and 
her husband have been, that that's not a system that she would change,' 
Tchen said.

Mrs Obama's 
tour comes as the U.S. tries to build diplomatic relations with China, 
which is set to overtake the American superpower as the world's largest 
economy within 15 years.

The visit has been seen as a
 prelude to an upcoming meeting between President Xi and Obama at a nuclear 
security summit in The Hague, when a number of thorny issues will be raised.

Aides
 for Mrs Obama have said the First Lady is staying away from 
contentious issues but promote education and people-to-people exchanges 
during the seven-day, three-city visit.

The Obama 
delegation is due to fly on Monday to Xi'an - home to the famed Terra Cotta 
Warriors Museum.

They are later expected to visit a panda breeding facility outside Chengdu in
 the southwest.
