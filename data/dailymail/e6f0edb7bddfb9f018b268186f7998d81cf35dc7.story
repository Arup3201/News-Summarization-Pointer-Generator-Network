This man has been courted by every politician in the run up to the next round of elections in India - because he has 39 wives and 127 children. 

Polygamist and sect leader Zionnghaka Chana has become the voter every politician in Mizoram state wants to know because of his influence over his 39 wives and 127 children and grandchildren.

Mr Chana, who has a 100-room home in the Baktawng village, Aizawl, told reporters: 'We were witnessing a rush of politicians seeking votes in the last few days.

'During every election we are much in demand as the winning margins of politicians in this state are slim, so even 100-odd votes matter to them.'

One of Mr Chana's wives, Rinkmini, said: 'When we go to vote, we always cast our ballots for the same candidate or party.

'That means more than 160-odd votes are assured from one family.'

Like most voters at this election, Mr Chana said he wanted clean government and development so that his family could prosper.

'All we want is good governance and the wellbeing of the state instead of personal gains for our family from the politicians,' he said.

Mizoram is the only state voting on Friday, in the fourth of nine stages of voting in the world's biggest election.

The
 Election Commission rescheduled polling following a dispute over 
whether tribal groups displaced during recent ethnic strife were allowed
 to vote in their refugee camps.

The
 state represents less than one percent of India's 814 million-strong 
electorate. Voting across India ends on May 12 - with results due four 
days later.

Mr Chana's 
grandfather founded the sect in the 1930s. It has some 1,700 members including four 
generations of the Chana family, many of whom carve wooden furniture and
 make pottery items.

The group live in an enormous 100-room, four-storey property - but some of the wives still have to sleep top-to-tail in communal dormitories.

The family is organised with great discipline. The oldest wife Zathiangi, 69, regularly draws up 
schedules for her fellow partners to take turns performing household 
chores such as preparing meals, washing and cleaning.

THE WIVES: Zathiangi, 71, was the first woman Ziona married (left) while Hmaii, 57, became his second wife (right)

Pari, 60, is the 3rd wife  (left), while Tlungi, 65, was the fourth (right)

 Sangi, 62, is the 5th wife (left), while Sangi, 58, (right) is Ziona's 6th wife

Preparing meals is always a mammoth 
task - with one evening meal seeing them consume 30 chickens, 132lb of 
potatoes and up to 220lb of rice.

The property has its own school, a playground, carpentry workshops, piggery
 and poultry farms and a vegetable garden big enough to supply the whole
 family.

Mr Chana is also head of the sect - which allows members to take as many wives as they wish.

Muani, 41, was the 7th wife (left) and Changliani, 60, was the 9th (right)

Malsawmi, 48, (left) is Ziona's tenth wife while  Thangzeli, 40, was the 14th (right)

Chuani, 40, is the 15th wife (left) and  Muanpuii, 38, is number 16 (right)

Sawmi, 30, is wife number 17th (left) and Matluangi, 37, is the 19th (right)

Zuali, 37, (left) is the 20th wife, while Khumi, 65, is the 21st (right)

Ngeni, 37, is Ziona's 22nd wife (left) and  Rawni, 57, is the 23rd (right)

Remi, 37, is wife number 26th (left) and Hritpuii, 32, is the 27th (right)

Its
 philosophy is based on Christian teachings, although leaders from the 
Presbyterian church, the main faith in the state, reject Chana's embrace
 of polygamy.

He keeps 
the youngest women near to his bedroom with the older members of the 
family sleeping further away - and there is a rotation system for who 
visits his bedroom.

Rinkmini,
 one of Ziona's wives, who is 35, said: â€˜We stay around him as he is the
 most important person in the house. He is the most handsome person in 
the village.â€™

Rami, 27, is the 33rdwife (left),  Lalthai, 38, is the 34th wife (right)

Lawmii, 34, is wife number 35th (left) , and Rizapi, 35, is the 36th wife (right)

Kimii, 36, is the 37th wife (left), and Thari, 30, is the 38th wife (right)

Siami, 30, is the 39th wife (left) and Ziona, 67, (right) is one busy man!
