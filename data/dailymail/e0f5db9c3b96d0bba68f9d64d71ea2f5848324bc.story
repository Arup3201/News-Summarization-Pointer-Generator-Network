Tennis star Nick Kyrgios has fired the latest shot in an ongoing feud with rapper Drake - and clearly he's ready to call it a match.

The 19-year-old posted a tweet early on Tuesday morning, professing his love for the Canadian artist's music in a bid to put an end to their war of words.

'Let's be clear. I like @Drake - love his music, just said I was a little flat, ended up winning that match. No blame game here,' he wrote.

Tennis star Nick Kyrgios has made it clear he has no issue with Drake or his music, in an effort to clear the air and put an end to their war of words

After his near loss to Czech Republic's Jirí Veselý in the third-round at Wimbledon last month, Nick Kyrgios blamed Drake's music for his flat performace

Drake is yet to respond, but the tweet appears to be a peace offering after Kyrgios claimed the performer's music was to blame for his near loss to Czech Republic's Jirí Veselý in the third-round at Wimbledon last month.

Following the match, Kyrgios blamed his bad start and general lacklustre performance on the music he was listening to before the first set.

'I came out really flat, so hopefully I won’t listen to that again! It was actually Drake. Didn’t do the job for me,' Kyrgios said after the game.

Clearly rubbing Drake the wrong way, the performer hit back at the tennis prodigy's comments last Friday during a teleconference talking about hosting US-based Entertainment and Sports Programming Network's annual sporting awards the Excellence in Sports Performance Yearly Awards this Wednesday, reported Stereogum.

Drake hit back at the comments on Friday, saying he wants to meet the tennis player and 'chop him right down'

About a week-and-a-half before his clash against Veselý, Kyrgios tweeted 'Own it- Drake', the name of a track off the artist's current album Nothing Was the Same

'I also want to meet this guy that says that he lost because he listened to my music,' the rapper said. 'I also want to meet that guy and look him in the eye and see exactly who he is as a man and size him up and then chop him right down.

'Nick whatever-his-name-is — 'cause he didn't win, so that's how he's going to be remembered: "Nick whatever-his-name-is".'

Contrary to Drake's comments, Kyrgios won the match and went on to beat world number one Rafael Nadal before going down to Milos Raonic in the quarterfinals.

Nick Kyrgios, was spotted driving around his home-town of Canberra in a flashy new silver Mercedes on Monday

The 19-year-old arrived home to his family in Canberra on Sunday

On Monday Kyrgios was spotted driving around his hometown of Canberra in a new silver Mercedes after arriving back home on Sunday.

The teenager has been enjoying some down time with a few friends at home since his stellar Wimbledon appearance.

'It was great to come home to my Mum and brother Christos, the reception at Canberra Airport was so special and to see so many people come out to greet me was more than I could have asked for, it was very humbling actually and I felt a little embarrassed that they were there for me,' Kyrgios wrote in his blog on Saturday.

'I've managed to catch up with my mates and hang out with the boys, shoot some hoops and eat copious amounts of Sushi and Chinese foods since I've been home although from today I will eat cleaner as I have one eye on next week and heading down to Melbourne for a few days with Todd to start my training block.'

Kyrgios also reflected on his loss to eight seed Milos Raonic, who knocked him out of the Wimbledon competition on his blog

'People keep talking about how my life will change forever and although I feel exactly the same and believe me, my mates and my family will not allow me to change but I have noticed a change in the way people are now towards me.

'I notice a lot more people stare and point, others come and say well done and what not which I prefer, but it's all positive.'

Kyrgios also reflected on his loss to eight seed Milos Raonic, who knocked him out of the Wimbledon competition.

'In the quarters as you could probably see, I was cooked and really needed that day off in between but I guess that is the nature of the beast playing on grass at Wimbledon, the schedule is something that can change more than at any other slam and you have to take the rough with the smooth,' he said.

'I'll go away and work harder to make sure I am better equipped for that next time.'

The tennis star will spend the next few weeks training in Melbourne and Canberra for the US Open.
