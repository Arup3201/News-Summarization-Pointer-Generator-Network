Third time lucky: She's tried and failed twice to win votes in general and local elections, now Suellem is putting her self up for election for a third time, but has promised to keep her clothes on

A Brazilian election candidate has promised 'not to use her body' to secure votes in next year's national polls, it was reported today.

Suellem Rocha, 27, who goes by her nickname 'Pear-shaped Woman', ran for a seat in the country's congress in the last elections in 2010.

But she came last with just 3,000 votes after promising to reveal her 'intimate piercings' if she was elected.

Last year former dancer Ms Rocha tried again, this time as councillor in her home city of Sao Paulo, south east Brazil.

She started her campaign started with a strip tease in a well-known lap dancing club, and appealed for votes by publishing a photo of her bare bottom brandished with her candidate number.

She explained: 'When they published my photo they always show my face, but I'm Pear-shaped Woman, known for by backside.'

But she lost out on one of the 55 councillor places after polling just 2,000 votes, putting her in 257th place.

Ms Rocha today announced she would be running for state deputy in next year's general election, as a candidate for the Workers Party of Brazil.

But she promised: 'I will not be using my body to ask for votes.

'Instead my platform will be sustainability, preservation and reforestation, so that we can have a better life in the future.'
