Billionaire investor Carl Icahn is the person who bought an Atlantic City property that earned its owner folk hero status for resisting decades of overtures from developers including Donald Trump.

Citing real estate records, The Press of Atlantic City reports Icahn's IEH Investments LLC paid $583,000 for Vera Coking's modest three-story boardinghouse at an auction in August.

Coking won attention over the years as she repeatedly rebuffed offers from Trump and Penthouse publisher Bob Guccione, as well as an attempted state takeover of her property.

She now lives in a California retirement home.

Construction crews are now removing asbestos from the building in advance of its demolition. Many of the windows are gone, and the exterior has been wrenched off one side.

The home sits next to the now-closed Trump Plaza casino.

Press of Atlantic City reports that the Trump Plaza was one of four casinos to shut down this year as the state reeled from economic troubles.

Icahn now controls the now bankrupt Trump Entertainment Resorts Inc's debt, and could potentially take control of the casino. 

He's already slated to take over the Trump Taj Mahal Casino Resort after that casino shuts down on Dec. 12.

He has yet to announce plans for the Coking home, the purchase of which puts him in control of prime real estate barely half a block from the Boardwalk. 

It's possible that both the house and Trump Plaza will be demolished to expand the Walk, the city's shopping and entertainment district.

'From what I heard, it would be demolished and incorporated into the extension of The Walk,” Nate Chait, Coking’s Atlantic City real estate broker, told Press of Atlantic City. 'They’ve talked about making it more of an entertainment area. I don’t think it’s going to be a casino again.'

Coking purchased the home with husband Raymond, who passed away in 1967, at the price of $20,000 in the 1960s when casino gambling was still a decade off in the city's landscape. 

'They're private people. They wanted closure,' Chair said. 'They just got tired of the games. They wanted to put it behind them and move on.'

The house was listed at nearly $5 million in 2011, but that price had tumbled to $995,000 by the time of the August auction.

'In hindsight, you always want more. But I think they’re happy to move on,' Chait said.
