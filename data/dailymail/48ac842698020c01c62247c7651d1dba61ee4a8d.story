Having concentrated on her career up until her mid 30s, Claire Patterson had still not met Mr Right and was conscious that her biological clock was ticking.

With a professional career under her belt and financially stable, the photographer decided she wanted a baby of her own - and decided to adopt.

After sailing through the process, she was shown a video of a little boy who melted her heart. ‘He was sitting down and then suddenly he smiled and that was it,’ Claire said.

Claire Patterson was delighted when she was told she could adopt a baby boy

‘I didn’t want any child with a disability as I was a single adopter and I couldn’t facilitate that.

‘It said in his child performance report that he was a healthy, babbling baby boy and I was thrilled when I was told I could collect him.

‘It was such a special day and he was going to be my very special boy, I was very excited.’

Claire knew that her child had some mild developmental delay but said she felt optimistic.

‘I thought he couldn’t crawl because he had been in care and thought with a bit of determination and one-to-one care from me, it was only a matter of time.’

Having only seen the video and some photographs, Claire, who is now 40, started to worry when she met him and took him home two weeks later: '‘I was concerned about the shape of his head. It seemed to be very flat at the back, but even then, I didn’t know what was to come,’.

She said looking back, alarm bells should have rung sooner that there was something seriously wrong with her son.

‘He didn’t do anything you would expect a child of his age to do,’ she said.

‘He couldn’t roll over, he couldn’t talk or crawl and had very poor muscle tone.’

She took him to speech therapy and would encourage him constantly, but said he never missed her if she went out of the room and didn’t speak at all, other than one word, ‘mummy’.

Having adopted him in 2011, Claire had persevered and the little boy learnt to walk.

However, having been to visit her parents in the Lake District in October 2012, Claire’s world began to disintegrate.

‘I’d just pulled into a petrol station in Preston when I turned around and he was in the back of the car and started to jolt - he was having a seizure. It was one of the most terrifying moments of my life.’

Claire took many photographs of the little boy in the two years he spent with her, including this one

Unfortunately, it was the first of many seizures which eventually resulted in him going to Great Ormond Street Hospital in London.

‘He had neurological damage, or brain damage, and had been born that way,’ Claire said.

‘He was having 36 seizures a day and his epilepsy was a symptom of something much bigger. He didn’t know who I was.

‘At one point we were sleeping downstairs with a bag packed, always ready for the ambulance. His seizures were out of control.

‘He had breathing difficulties and once was in a coma. At one point it was thought he might even die.

‘It was very, very stressful and I had reached the end of my physical and mental strength.’

Claire said she felt she had no option but to call social workers who she said agreed with medics that he could no longer be cared for at home.

‘It was a heartbreaking decision, I loved him,’ she said. ‘It’s certainly not something I took lightly at all, but I had nothing more to give and had to hand him back.’

However, Claire said that although social workers had agreed she couldn’t care for him, a legal ‘care order’ is needed to hand a child back which she says implies the parents are at fault as they cannot look after it.

Claire said she was so incensed, she went to court to win a ‘no fault’ ruling, thus ensuring there would be no negative reflection on her, crucial if she wanted to adopt again.

‘I had to give him back through no fault of my own, and I wanted a record of that,’ she says.

Now Claire has launched a website called Adoption Disruption UK to provide support for others for whom adoption breaks down.

‘Sometimes it just doesn’t work out and parents have no choice but to return their children, whether they are babies or teenagers,’  Claire said.

‘More needs to be done around care orders as it’s not always the fault of parents that they have to hand their children back.’

Claire said that the little boy is now living in a home environment where he is cared for by four people around-the-clock.

Currently embarking on a new adoption journey, Claire hopes to be approved to adopt another child in six months’ time.

‘I’m hoping to have a child between three and six years old,’ she said. ‘I’m very hopeful for the future and through my website, I hope I can help support someone who might be feeling as isolated as I did,’ she added.
