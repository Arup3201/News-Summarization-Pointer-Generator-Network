A village primary school where seven members of staff look after just two pupils is to stay open despite an annual cost of £110,000 to the taxpayer.

The Ysgol y Glyn school in the village of Lower 
Brynamman, near Neath in South Wales, was due to have 32 pupils running 
around the playground at the start of this term.

But parents in the village feared the
school is on the verge of closure and so decided to move their children to 
neighbouring schools instead.

Quiet education: A father this morning walks his daughter and son - the school's only pupils - to lessons

Today,
just one father took his son and daughter to the Victorian building, a four-classroom school that dates back to 1896.

The two children are looked after by seven staff - a head teacher, a deputy head, a part-time teacher, a teaching assistant, a cook, a cleaner and a caretaker.

Despite
the costs, education chiefs said the school may have to stay open until
the end of the year to accommodate the two children.

Villager Don Gray, 60, who lives next door to the school, said: 'My children went there more than 30 years ago and it is a terrible shame to see it so quiet.

'It is a big loss and the children absolutely loved it there. The staff are great but it is a bit daft to have it just for two children.

'All the parents moved their children away because they were told it was going to close next year - they didn't want to wait.'

The school costs £110,000-a-year to 
run - and education chiefs are trying to find new positions for the 
seven staff who are on contracts.

Parents in the village blamed the failure on the local council and the Welsh government to agree on the future of the school.

Costly: Just two children attend the Ysgol y Glyn primary school in 
Lower Brynamman in South Wales where they are looked after by seven 
staff

Last year, education chiefs had decided to close it in the summer and move pupils to neighbouring villages.

But parents objected and the government agreed to postpone its closure until the end of the year.

However, all but one family voted with their feet by moving their children to other schools.

The father who took his son and daughter to school yesterday declined to comment on the row.

But it is understood his family is planning to leave the local area and did not want to move the children to new schools twice.

Karl Napieralla, director of education for Neath Port Talbot council, said: 'Our original proposals advocated closure on educational and economic grounds at the end of the summer term.

'However, the Welsh government decided to keep the school open until the end of the calendar year.

'Discussions are taking place with the school, family concerned and the Welsh government about bringing the closure forward to half term.'

Local councillor Alwyn Woolcock led the campaign to save the school.

He said: 'There were 197 objectors and a petition of hundreds to keep the school open.

'But back in June it was announced that the school will close on December 31.'

He said there were 32 pupils on the roll, but the closure row had caused a lot of 'ill-feeling because a school is the heart of a community'.

He added: 'It has left a bitter taste in my mouth and the mouths of the staff, governors and the whole community.'

Talks are today under way to permanently close the school at half-term next month - but it may still have to stay open until Christmas.

A Welsh government spokesperson said: 'The local authority is monitoring the situation at the school.'
