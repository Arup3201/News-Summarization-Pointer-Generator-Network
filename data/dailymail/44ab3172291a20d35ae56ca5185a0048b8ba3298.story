Novak Djokovic's choice to postpone his wedding to concentrate on Wimbledon certainly paid off as he saw off Roger Federer in the final to pick up his second SW19 title.

And now the Serb is finally getting the chance to tie the knot with his fiancee Jelena Ristic, touching down in Montenegro ahead of the ceremony.

The couple were originally due to tie the knot on June 14, but decided to postpone their nuptials in favour of the famous grass court tournament and are now making up for lost time.

Here comes the... groom: Novak Djokovic arriving in Montenegro earlier this week ahead of his wedding to long-term love Jelena Ristic

Dressed casually in tailored red shorts and a sky blue shirt, the Grand Slam number one was hugged by members of his security team as he and Jelena hopped into a vehicle at Tivat airport to be transported to their wedding venue.

Ditching tennis whites for the occasion, Jelena looked every inch the ethereal bride-to-be in a flowing chiffon printed maxi-dress.

The happy couple were transported to the site of their nuptials, the lavish esort of Sveti Stefan, where preparations appear to be well underway.

Fellow Serbian tennis champ Janko Tipsarević and his partner Biljana were spotted arriving on the picture perfect Adriatic island, a 5-star franchise hotel of the international group of Aman Resorts,  as they led the charge of sporting stars preparing to see the pair tie the knot.

Formerly an island, Sveti Stefan is now connected to the mainland by a narrow isthmus and features eight lavish suits, as well as 50 rooms and numerous cottages to house the couple's guests.

Also seen arriving was Miljan Amanovic, the tennis star's personal physio, and Novak's tennis player brother Marko.

Wedding bells! No doubt enjoying basking in his glory over Roger Federer on Sunday, the 27-year-old sportsman appeared happy and relaxed as he touched down in Montenegro with his wife-to-be as they prepare to tie the knot

The Serbian sportsman is believed to have changed his mind about his wedding at the last minute prior to the couple's planned June nuptials.

Guests such as Sarah Ferguson, Richard Branson, Andy Murray, Maria Sharapova and more were rumoured to be attending the ceremony but hopefully will have now rescheduled their plans.

The Serbian couple have been together for around eight years, and Jelena is often seen in the crowd cheering him on at major tournaments across the world.

Let's get the party started: Tipsarevic looked excited as he unloaded his luggage from his car

She told the Daily Mail in July: ‘We are emotional partners. The emotional support we give to each other is very important.

‘It's the same for me as well. He is very supportive and encouraging of the work that I do.’

Djokovic felt Sunday's victory had been the best of his 14 grand slam finals but, as great as his tennis was, it was the 27-year-old's mental strength that really shone through.

Having won only one of his previous six grand slam finals and none of the last three, there could not have been a bigger test than having to come through a deciding set having served for victory in the fourth and seen a match point slip away.

Brotherly love: Novak's tennis player brother Marko Djokovic was, of course, on hand to witness the lavish nuptials

But Djokovic kept believing and, after saving a break point in the seventh game, turned the match back in his favour to clinch a second Wimbledon title.

He said of his win: 'It wasn't about where I was but about what I went through in this moment. I took some time to refocus and forget about what happened in the fourth set, forget about the missed opportunities and move on.

Preparation: Men get the area ready at the luxurious resort of Sveti Stefan in Montenegro

Great view: The wedding party will certainly be relishing the chance to see the landscape from the roof top of the rustic building

'I had this positive encouragement to say to myself, and even though you go through different emotions during such an important match and there are times when you have doubts

'And especially after the fourth set the disappointment that brought with it the fear and all these different demons inside.

'When you start fighting them that's the biggest fight that you can have. That's what I experienced and I managed to have my conviction stronger than my doubts and managed to push myself the very last step to win the trophy.'

What a week: Winning Wimbledon was no doubt the best way for Djokovic to lead up to his wedding
