President Barack Obama will remain at the White House on both Monday and Tuesday as voters head to the polls to determine whether to oust his political party from power in the Senate.

A copy of his public schedule reveals the president's plans to return to Washington, D.C. on Sunday after campaign events in Connecticut and Pennsylvania and stay there through Election Day.

On Monday Obama will sit down with Federal Reserve Chair Janet Yellen. The following day he'll take other meetings at the White House instead of barnstorming the country, campaigning for endangered Democrats.

While the president will be out of sight this week, Republicans, who have framed the off-year elections as a 'referendum' on Obama, hope he will not be out of mind. 

A final pre-election survey conducted by ABC News and the Washington Post shows that the second-term president's approval rating is still down in the dumps. Election forecasts now give his party a 74 percent chance of losing the Senate to Republicans.

MIA: President Obama is participating in get out the vote activities this weekend for Democrats but he'll stay out of sight at the White House on Monday and Tuesday as his party barrells toward defeat in the midterm elections

The percentage of Americans who disapprove of the job Obama's doing has stayed steady at 51 percent over the last month and a half, data released by the Post shows. His net approval rating is only slightly better than it was in early October, up from 40 percent to 43 percent.

The president's inability to win over the electorate before Tuesday's elections was the overriding theme during the final round of weekend prognosticating.

'This is really the last chance for America to pass judgment on the Obama administration and on its policies,' 2012 Republican presidential nominee Mitt Romney told Fox News Sunday host Chris Wallace.

'And the president himself said he's not on the ballot, but his policies are - that includes hesitancy and weakness abroad, which has led to a certain degree, to the rise of ISIS. It also includes the violation of the most fundamental promise of Obamacare, to let people to keep their doctor and their insurance if they wanted to keep it. 

'It's a policy of basic amnesty for those that come to the country illegally,' Romney said, pointing to Obama's promise that he would take immigration reform into his own hands before the end of the year if Congress doesn't make changes of it's own to the flawed system.

Romney, a top GOP surrogate this election cycle, said his party wants to 'take a different direction.'

'We're to break the blockade in Washington by having a Republican Senate. We'll have an energy policy, which means we're gonna have the Keystone pipeline. We're going to secure the border. We're jump-start the economy,' he said, adding that the GOP would 'help get people out of poverty' and ensure 'their kids will have better schools.'

Another favorite campaign buddy of Republican challengers this year, Republican Sen. Rand Paul, also cast Tuesday as a 'repudiation of the president's policies.' 

'This is a referendum on the president. So no question, this is a big message to the president,' Paul told Meet the Press host Chuck Todd during an appearance on NBC.

After Todd asked him if a GOP victory this week would serve as a 'mandate' in favor of Republican policies, Paul said it's a 'combination' of unhappiness with Obama and a desire to see an end to the 'gridlock' in Congress.

'It's a message that people are tired of nothing getting done,' he said. 'So I think if we win, you will see legislation passed, and you will see legislation sent to the desk of the president.'

Despite Obama's efforts this weekend, Democrats are have a 74 percent chance of losing the Senate on Tuesday, forecasts show

FiveThirtyEight founder and statistician Nate Silver gave Republicans on Sunday a 73-74 percent chance of taking of winning the majority in the Senate. The Huffington Post's analysts came to roughly the same conclusion, putting the number a tick higher at 75 percent.

Polling site Real Clear Politics now gives Republicans a two-seat advantage over Democrats in the Senate, though the status of eight contested races is still in flux - two of which may take additional run-off elections to decide.

If key elections and Georgia and Louisiana both go to a run-off, it could be two months before the fate of the Senate is decided. Republicans may win enough competitions to take control of the Senate outright, however, regardless of what happens in either run-off scenario.

Although Republicans are widely predicted to retire several of her colleagues on Tuesday, Minnesota Sen. Amy Klobuchar said Sunday morning she still has hope for her comrades.

She acknowledged that the president is better liked in some areas of the country than others, then argued that Democratic Senate candidates were able to win statewide in 2012, when Obama was last on the ballot, in parts of the country that voted for Romney.

'I think a lot of that has to do with the fact that we have candidates that are independent of whatever the administration's policies are,' she told Face the Nation host Bob Schieffer. 'You certainly see them disagreeing with him on number of policy issues.

'These are moderate Democrats,' she said, who 'for the most part who have shown that kind of civility that we want in Washington.' 

Taking a jab at outspoken conservative Sen. Ted Cruz of Texas and his filibuster last year, she said, 'courage isn't just standing by yourself giving speech on Green Eggs and Ham. Courage is whether or not you're willing to stand next to someone you don't always agree with.'

Democratic Senators fighting for their political lives this year are willing to do that, she added.

Klobuchar rejected the narrative that President Obama has not stuck his neck out to save his party this year because of his own political problems.

'I think first of all we have to acknowledge that the president has helped these candidates in terms of fundraising for the Senate campaign committee,' she said. 'He's been out there. He's done a lot of work.'

President Obama will not be out there, standing arm in arm with his party, win or lose, on Tuesday, however.

In fact, if Democrats do keep control of the Senate, Obama won't be around to celebrate their success when they triumphantly return to Washington, D.C. The president will embark on a trip to China next Sunday evening and won't return for nine days.

Congress, on the other hand, is schedule to reconvene next Wednesday. Political parties traditionally hold new member orientation that week, as well, to help the newest additions of the rank and file get settled in before they take the oath of office in January. Because of his trip, Obama will not be on hand to meet and greet new Democratic lawmakers if and when they first arrive.
