Zinedine Zidane hailed Gareth Bale as one of the top five players in the world and says it would be a ‘tragedy’ if he did not play at a major international tournament in his career.

Bale will look to get Wales’ qualification campaign for Euro 2016 off to a winning start when they face Andorra on Tuesday night.

And with the European Championships expanded to 24 teams - Wales have their best ever chance to make the tournament in France.

Winning the lot: Zidane won the World Cup and Euros

Zidane – who is Real Madrid's B team manager – claims watching his Madrid team-mates playing at the World Cup while he sat at home hurt Bale.

He said: ‘Gareth is desperate to play in a major tournament with Wales - he did not want to be sitting at home in the summer while all his team-mates were in Brazil.

‘It will be a tragedy if he never gets to play in a World Cup or European Championships. He is one of the top five players in the world - for him not to be there is just wrong.’

Zidane claims that Bale – who helped Real Madrid win the Champions League in his first season at the Bernabeu – cannot get Wales to the Euros on his own, but he can be the leader on the pitch.

The former French international added: ‘One player can't qualify for Euro 2016 - but what Gareth can be is Wales leader.

‘It doesn't matter who they play in the qualifiers - when Gareth is always on the field - they always have a match winner.’
