A goal against England is the stuff of which childhood dreams are made. The image likely crossed Andy Robertson’s mind when he was kicking about the playground of St Joseph’s Primary.

Robertson  returned to his old school in Clarkston on Wednesday for a promotional visit having just realised that very feat. Yet jubilation was the furthest thing from his mind.

The Scotland left-back admitted a first strike for his nation meant little in the context of a 3-1 defeat from Roy Hodgson’s classy side at Celtic Park.

Sharply critical of his own defensive display, Robertson insisted he would gladly have traded his brief moment of glory for blanking out England at the other end of the field.

That kind of clear-eyed self-analysis perhaps speaks volumes of why the 20-year-old has enjoyed such extraordinary progress over the past 18 months.

While family and friends would have wanted to re-live the left-foot strike that zipped inside’s Fraser Forster’s near post, Robertson spent Tuesday night agonising over the other 89 minutes.

‘I didn’t get much sleep,’ he admitted. ‘I went straight home and straight to bed, but there was a lot of tossing and turning. I was more trying to think about my defensive performance, not the goal.

‘I’ll find out in time about being able to reflect on the goal but for now it’s at the back of my mind. I’m more disappointed about the overall performance and my own performance.

‘It’s tough one. A normal person would probably have been delighted to score against England to get their first goal for Scotland. But I’ve already forgotten about it. We got beat 3-1 and that’s the most annoying thing for me.

‘I thought I could have done better personally in a defensive sense. And first and foremost I am a defender. So if I could have swapped the goal for a clean sheet I would have taken it.

‘I was obviously delighted to see it hit the back of the net. It was a proud moment for me and my family. Maybe for that minute or two I could just enjoy the feeling and hope that I’d helped us get back into the game. Sadly, though, England went up the park and scored again.’

Robertson’s goal came seven minutes from the end and was made at Tannadice. After feeding the ball to fellow former Dundee United player Johnny Russell, he gave the returned cutback the finish it deserved.

By that point, England were already two in front. Alex Oxlade-Chamberlain struck first when he ghosted off Robertson’s flank and behind Grant Hanley to convert a sublime delivery from Jack Wilshere.

Rooney then claimed the first of his brace by heading home a loose ball that had rebounded off Robertson. Both concessions gave the Hull City defender cause for regret.

‘Looking back at the first goal, I probably should have tucked in and tried to block him,’ reflected Robertson.

‘Even if I did, it was an absolutely world-class ball so I don’t know how much I would have been able to stop it. But I would have been much happier if I had followed him in and tried to stop it, rather than just letting him go.

‘For the second goal, it could probably happen another 100 times and not fall on Wayne Rooney’s head. I didn’t have much time to react. I didn’t know if someone was behind me so I felt I had to get a leg on it. Unfortunately, it went to the head of a deadly finisher. I wasn’t so annoyed with that one but I felt I should still have done better.

‘We got ourselves back to 2-1 for a short time but England deserved to win overall. It was disappointing we couldn’t put pressure on them for the last 10 minutes. Instead, they went up the pitch and scored again so quickly. But, as I said, looking back on the game we can have no complaints about the result.’

It was a score-line that also prevented the old Scottish trait of getting ahead of ourselves from rearing its head. The national side’s development under Gordon Strachan has been substantial and rightly lauded. Friday night’s win over the Republic of Ireland was the most significant for years and left us firmly in contention for a place at Euro 2016.

England’s visit was, however, a reminder of the distance still to be travelled, of how only a maximum collective effort can thwart teams of superior quality.

‘On Tuesday night, the English players were a better standard than us,’ Robertson recognised. ‘But we didn’t play to our best. Hopefully we can get a shot at them again and show what we can do.

‘The next time the squad meets up, we can analyse it and see what went wrong. That will help us for the future.

‘There were a lot of fans and media saying we were a good team but we knew we still had work to do. We’ve got off to a good start in the Euro 2016 campaign, which is the main thing overall, and hopefully we can kick on from there. The priority for us is to get back to the top end of international football at a major tournament finals.’

It is four months until Scotland are back in action against Gibraltar. Barring the calamity to end all calamities, the next truly meaningful game is the trip to Dublin next June.

Robertson will complete a first season in the Barclays Premier League in the interim, having been playing part-time football with Queen’s Park as recently as May 2013.

‘If you had said a year ago that I would have got five Scotland caps in 2014, I would have said you were a liar,’ he insisted.

‘Looking back on it, I’m delighted I can represent my country in such big games. Hopefully there are a lot more happy memories to come.

‘I don’t really set myself targets and challenges. I just try and take everything that comes to me. We will see what is coming in 2015. Hopefully we will still be talking about me playing for Scotland and doing well for Hull City.’

Andrew Robertson visited St Joseph’s in support of Tesco Bank’s Community Programme to promote the health benefits of the game. Run in partnership with the SFA, it has so far involved over 82,000 children from more than 2,000 schools.
