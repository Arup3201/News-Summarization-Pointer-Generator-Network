Come rain or shine, the green-fingered Langdon family have exhibited their prize-winning blooms every year since Chelsea Flower Show began a century ago.

Now in their fourth generation, the family-run firm Blackmore
and Langdon will join the many other exhibitors at the historic show, which opens its doors on Tuesday and this year celebrates one hundred years of glorious gardens.

A party of royal guests headed by the Queen will be given a sneak preview of the Chelsea Flower Show tomorrow, ahead of its public opening.

Celebrities are also invited to see the results of months of hard work from gardening experts, showcasing their designs in the week-long extravaganza, which organisers promise will be the 'greatest ever'.

To mark the centenary, many gardens 
draw inspiration from shows of yesteryear - with others looking firmly 
to the future, including one that reacts to messages sent on Twitter.

The Langdon family, who have faithfully made the journey every year from Bristol to London to exhibit their prize-winning blooms, will again display their first-class begonias and delphiniums, which have picked up a haul of 70 gold medals over the decades.

With many years of experience behind them, Blackmore
and Langdon were even at the Royal International Horticultural Exhibition in 1912, 
the forerunner to the RHS Chelsea Flower Show.

And with just days to go until the 100th 
show, the Langdon family are among those putting the finishing touches 
to their display ahead of the opening to RHS members on Tuesday and Wednesday, and the general public from 
Thursday to Saturday.

The landmark year has also led to a 
favourite of many a garden, the ornamental gnome, being given special 
dispensation - ordinarily, the Chelsea Flower Show has a strict ban on 
gnomes 'and other brightly-coloured mythical creatures'.

Royals
attending tomorrow will include the Duke of Edinburgh, the Prince of 
Wales, the Duchess of Cornwall, the Duke of York and Princess Beatrice.

Prince
Harry will also be there to show his grandmother, patron of show 
organisers the Royal Horticultural Society, around a garden very close 
to his own heart.

The B&Q Sentebale Forget-me-not garden has been created by his charity, which is showing at Chelsea for the first time.

Fourth generation: Si, Steve & Nick Langdon are now at the helm of this long-running family firm

The company first launched in 1901, 
when James Blackmore and Charles Langdon met at Bath flower show while 
exhibiting their prize-winning begonias.

As
friendship turned into business, the two decided to create a family-run
company, selling small bunches of cut flowers from a tiny courtyard in 
Bath.

A florist department was later added to the nursery, expanding the business that thrived on making wreaths and wedding bouquets.

The family have now shared their fascinating story with ancestry website, Genes Reunited.

Rosemary
Langdon, third generation to the family business, said the secret to 
their success can be put down to hard work and dedication.

She
said: 'I think one of the really important things in keeping a business
going for so long is keeping our values in the right perspective.

'We are very aware that nothing is achieved without hard work and dedication.

'We value our staff for all their hard work and we appreciate our customers for their loyalty.'

Head of Genes Reunited, Rhoda 
Breakell, said: 'Small companies such as Blackmore and Langdon are a 
truly inspirational example of years of hard work and dedication.

'Maintaining
a successful family business for over a century is a fantastic 
achievement and they should be extremely proud to be exhibiting 100 
years on from when it all began.'

Although
John and Rosemary Langdon are now officially retired, their three sons,
Simon, Stephen and Nicholas maintain the companyâ€™s exemplary standards 
and continue to run the business.
