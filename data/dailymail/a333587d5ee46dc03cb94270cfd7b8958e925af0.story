Animal lovers are in for a real treat this weekend, with not one but two pet-dominated Super Bowl specials to choose from. 

The wildly popular Puppy Bowl returns for its 11th annual showdown courtesy of the Animal Planet at 3pm EST on Sunday, with Hallmark Channel's Kitten Bowl - back for its second year - kicking off at noon.

Both tournaments will see a bevy of adorable critters tussle it out with pint-sized footballs on pet-friendly stadiums, all to them available for adoption; the puppies hailing from the Arizona Humane Society and the kittens provided by several New York-based shelters.

'Everybody loves a puppy,' Chris Finnegan, a senior vice president at Animal Planet told Reuters. 'The amount of attention that we've got has been fantastic.

'People just can't get enough. They're so sweet. They're so cute, and we're excited because it's getting the word out about animal adoptions.'  

Twenty-five pups have been on display each day this week outside a Phoenix cafe where a fake football field has been set up, as spectators gather to cheer them on. 

A black-and-white shirted human 'referee' kept a score, of sorts, and Team Fluff was soon beating Team Ruff by two goals to zip.

'That's a flag! That's unnecessary roughness, plus it's embarrassing because you're on the same side!' said the referee, blowing his whistle as onlookers laughed.

Debbie Mykitiak, who works for an Arizona animal charity called Rescue, was among the crowd watching yesterday's game.

'I came down to see the puppies, and the live Puppy Bowl, and in the hope that all of these little guys will have homes by Sunday afternoon,' she said, as play was delayed while one Labrador puppy took a bathroom break on the 30-yard line.

All the puppies  will be available for adoption from the Arizona Humane Society beginning Sunday. Animal Planet says it will cover part of the cost of adoptions.

As for the kittens, the North Shore Animal League America and Last Hope Animal Rescue and Rehabilitation will provide over 90 adoptable kittens for the feline showdown.

All of them will be adopted out immediately following the games. Last year, all 71 of the feline players found homes. 

Kitten Bowl II will be hosted by Beth Stern, a television personality and spokesperson for the North Shore Animal League America, as well as sportscasters Mary Carillo and John Sterling.

The action will kick off with semi-final matches between the Northpole Panthers and Hallmark Channel Hearties, and the Good Witch Wildcats versus the Hallmark Movies & Mysteries Mountain Lions. 

Both specials will no doubt score well with viewers. 

Last year's Puppy Bowl drew 13.5 million viewers, with the Kitten Bowl watched by 1 million.
