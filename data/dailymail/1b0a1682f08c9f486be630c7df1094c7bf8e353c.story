England planned to welcome back an old friend on Sunday when Andrew Flintoff was due to join them at their practice at the Gabba for his first involvement with the national team since he limped away from the 2009 Ashes.

Flintoff’s extraordinary comeback, which started with Lancashire last season and extended to the Brisbane Heat Big Bash team, now includes him putting in an appearance at England’s practice ahead of their tri-series game against India.

Before anyone gets too carried away it should be stressed that Flintoff has been asked to join the England team by coach Peter Moores not to bowl but to chat to the younger players and allow them to pick his brains.

It is felt that Flintoff, who has hinted that his comeback will come to an end after the Big Bash is concluded next week, will be a positive presence for a young England team still rebuilding after the upheaval of the last year.

It is unclear whether Flintoff, who has struggled to make an impression with Brisbane, was going to take part in training but he remains one of the best death bowlers in one-day cricket of the last 20 years and could surely pass on a tip or two.

The appearance of one of the legends of the 2005 Ashes series would give England a boost after their defeat in the tri-series opener against Australia and with them now desperately needing to beat India at the Gabba on Tuesday.

They received another setback yesterday when it was revealed that Gary Ballance broke the little finger of his right hand during fielding practice in Canberra ahead of the tri-series against Australia and India.

While it must be considered unfortunate that a player who has not featured in the first three games of this tour should pick up an injury England will not replace Ballance even though he is unlikely to be fit for the rest of the tri-series.

England are confident that their reserve batsman will be fit for the World Cup so will give James Taylor every chance to cement his place at No3 rather than rush in a replacement player just for the last three matches of this series.

Someone who still maintains he would welcome a call-up, unlikely though it is, is Kevin Pietersen, who yesterday became the highest scorer in the Australian Twenty20 competition this season when he hit 67 from 42 balls In Melbourne Stars victory over Sydney Thunder.

Yet there was no rush here to call in Pietersen to a net session as Moores and Stuart Broad, who extended the invitation, have done with Flintoff.

Meanwhile Yorkshire, the county champions, face a battle to keep hold of their highly rated coach Jason Gillespie as it emerged that South Australia want to take the former Australia fast bowler home to Adelaide.

Gillespie has been an outstanding success at Headingley and is settled in Leeds with his family but will face a severe test of his loyalty to his adopted county if South Australia follow up their interest with a firm offer.
