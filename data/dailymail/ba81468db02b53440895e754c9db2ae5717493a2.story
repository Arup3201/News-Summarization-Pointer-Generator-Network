A feisty squirrel takes on a fearsome 
foe when he decides to tackle a T-Rex. After sniffing out the plastic 
enemy, he climbs onto the dinosaur's back in order to claim victory.

The
 epic bout was captured by illustrator Max Ellis, 51, after he noticed 
the fight taking place in the back garden of his home in Teddington, Middlesex.

'This is evolution at work,' said Mr Ellis.

'Here we see the faster furry mammal running rings around the slower, dimmer Tyrannosaur.'

Spending
 ten minutes capturing the scene, he managed to interest the squirrel in
 the dinosaur by leaving out pieces of food to tempt the rodent.

Squirrels
 are known to have very versatile and sturdy claws for grasping and 
climbing, which came in useful for this brave squirrel as it scaled the 
dinosaur's head.

'The squirrel was a bit nervous at first, as I suppose he hadn't seen a Tyrannosaur before,' added Mr Ellis. 'When people see this set of photographs they feel unfathomable joy, it's not something you see every day.'

I'm not scared of you: The scenes were captured using a T-Rex model and food to lure out the squirrel. They were captured by illustrator Max Ellis

Duck! In this photo, the rodent appears to be avoiding the powerful crushing jaw of the dinosaur

Fearless: The squirrel gets up close and personal with the T-Rex, which could generate an estimated 60,000 Newtons - equivalent to a medium-sized elephant sitting on you - with its back teeth
