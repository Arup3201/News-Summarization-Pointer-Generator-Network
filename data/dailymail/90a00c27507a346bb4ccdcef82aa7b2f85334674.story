Former President Bill Clinton came to the defense of President Barack Obama over his affection for golf, saying he thinks 'it's a good thing' the current Commander-in-Chief has a hobby and that it doesn't insinuate he's 'lazy.'

'Every mind needs some release,' Clinton told Late Night host Seth Meyers during an appearance on Wednesday's show.

'You’ve got to be sensitive to the visuals. You don’t want to have a play picture at a sad time. You’ve got to be sensitive to that,' he said. 'But the idea of taking time off, I think it’s quite important.'

Bill Clinton says he thinks 'it's a good thing' the current Commander-in-Chief has a hobby; playing golf doesn't insinuate that a president is 'lazy,' Clinton said

The frequency of Obama's golfing has been an object of criticism throughout his six years in office. 

And unlike his predecessor, President George W. Bush, who stopped golfing two years into his tenure because he felt 'playing golf during a war just sends the wrong signal,' Obama refused to give up the sport, even when the country was in the midst of a crisis.

Meyers pointed out to Clinton on Wednesday that  'a lot of presidents golf' and they 'get in trouble' for it.

'How important are vacations when you have that job?' the comedian asked Clinton. 'How important is it to go somewhere, be it four hours on a golf course, to just get away from your job, or is your job too important to try to get away?'

Not missing a beat, Clinton replied, to laughter, 'Well, first of all, they can always get you if they need you' and noted that the president is always followed around by an agent carrying the nuclear 'football.'

'And you always have global communication. I've had a lot of international phone calls on golf courses,' he revealed.

'When it was going poorly, did you claim you ever claim you had an international call?' Meyers pondered.

'That never occurred to me,' Clinton reflected. 'Where were you when I needed you?'

Obama has played more than 200 rounds of golf since he's been in office. But Clinton said that doesn't say anything about his character, or the character of any previous presidents who often played the sport.

'On balance, none of these people would have had the job if they were lazy,' he said, 'and I think we ought to be tolerant.'

Clinton has been out of the White House since 2001. He could find himself living there again, though, if his wife, Hillary, runs for and wins the presidency next year. 

Meyers tried to smoke out Hillary's intentions asking Bill if he is in the market for a new home. 

'I hope not, because 2016 is the election year and I don't have any place to move,' Clinton responded.

Hillary Clinton has not formally entered the 2016 contest but she is reportedly interviewing staff and is expected to make her candidacy official in the next several months.

President Barack Obama and Bill Daley, White House chief of staff, look on as former President  Clinton, putts during a golf game at Andrews Air Force Base, Maryland in 2011. Obama's golfing has been the object of criticism throughout his six years in office, but Clinton said Wednesday that people out to be more 'tolerant' of the way he relaxes
