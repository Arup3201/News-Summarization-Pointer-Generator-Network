Paul Scholes says Wayne Rooney must be nastier and stop being nice to opponents.

The former Manchester United legend believes the England striker has lost his aggressive edge in recent years and must reclaim it to become the player he was during his teenage years.

‘In recent years I think he’s been too nice to opponents. You see him helping players up after challenges. He’s better when he’s nastier,’ wrote in his column in the Independent.

‘That was the way he was when he came on to the scene 12 years ago. He was the player who was aggressive and did not try to hide the fact that he hated losing.

‘If anything, Wayne’s the kind of player who’s better when he’s on the edge.’

Scholes also defended Rooney over his red-card challenge on Stewart Downing at Old Trafford on the weekend, saying it was not intended to hurt the West Ham man.

Scholes showed real bite in the Manchester United midfielder throughout his 20-year spell at the club

He said: ‘I don’t think Wayne Rooney’s tackle on Stewart Downing was the kind that hurts an opposing player.

'From what I could see of it, Wayne tried to trip him and ended up catching him higher up the leg than he had intended. It was the position on the pitch that puzzled me. It was not as if Downing was in on goal.’
