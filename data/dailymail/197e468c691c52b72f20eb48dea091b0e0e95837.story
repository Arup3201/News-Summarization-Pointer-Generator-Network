They may not have garnered worldwide attention from celebrity endorsements, but these top-selling brands from supermarket giant Aldi are credited with helping the company boost sales to $6 billion last year.

Beauty creams, nappies, a cafe-style coffee machine and a range of chocolate bars were among the best sellers for Aldi Australia in the past 12 months.

Aldi credits these products for helping to boost sales as the retailer vows to maintain pricing pressure in 2015 on its supermarket rivals in the $85 billion market.
