The family of one of the two young farm workers who died on a Tory peer's country estate have spoken out of their 'utter devastation' at his death.

Ashley Clarke, 24, was engaged to his long-term girlfriend and has been working to save up to marry her when tragedy struck on Monday afternoon.

Mr Clarke and colleague Scott Cain, 23, were discovered unconscious in an apple store on the 2,500 acre property owned by the Earl of Selborne, John Palmer.

Frantic colleagues at the Blackmoor Estate at Liss, Hants, tried in vain to save father-of-one Mr Cain and amateur rugby player Mr Clarke.

It is thought that the workers, who 
were collecting apples, were “overcome by fumes” and unable to breathe 
after entering the building which is kept cool by a system that uses 
nitrogen.

Worried colleagues at the renowned 
fruit farm raised the alarm when the pair failed to come back from their
 duties on Monday afternoon.

But despite the efforts of colleagues
 and paramedics the men, who were both found to be in cardiac arrest, 
were tragically pronounced dead at the scene.

The family of Mr Clarke along with 
his fiancee, Rachel Higgins, and her family have released a statement 
through police where they express their devastation at their loss.

They said: ‘Words cannot express the pain we are all feeling at Ashley's passing.

‘He was the very heart and soul of 
both our families and he was so much in love with Rachel that it hurts 
to see the torment she is going through.

Father of four: John Palmer is the fourth Earl of Selborne. He is a member of the Conservative party

‘He had a passion for life and the utter devastation felt by everybody who knew him is testament to his popularity and the impact he had on many of those who knew and loved him.

‘We still have many questions which will need to be answered in the fullness of time, but nothing will bring Ashley back or take away the incredible pain we are all feeling.

‘We have lost someone special, a son, a brother, fiance and friend who can never be replaced and we will never forget him.

‘But for now we need to grieve, supporting each other to help us through what are very difficult times.’

Hampshire Constabulary and the Health
 and Safety Executive (HSE) have launched a joint investigation into the
 deaths which are being treated as “unexplained”.

Blackmoor Estate, which was 
established in the 1920s, has a long-standing reputation for growing 
both traditional and new varieties of English apples, pears, plums which
 are also used to produce cider and juices.

It is owned by the fourth Earl of 
Selborne, 72, who is a member of the Conservative party and entered the 
House of Lords in 1971, becoming a hereditary peer in 1999.

Staff on his country estate, where 
the fruit is grown, stored, graded and packed, were last night said to 
be distraught over the tragedy.

Lord Selborne’s son, William Wolmer, 
Managing Director of Blackmoor Estate Limited, said everyone was 
“absolutely devastated” by the deaths.

He said in a statement: ‘This is absolutely devastating for our tightknit community and our thoughts are with their loved ones.

‘The cause of this tragic incident is being investigated and the estate is co-operating fully with the authorities.’

Keen footballer Mr Cain, from 
Liphook, had been engaged to marry his long-term girlfriend Filipa 
Turner, 24, and had a three-year-old daughter called Isla.

Relatives said last night that Miss Turner had been left “devastated” by his death.

Mr Cain was a centre-back at Wey Valley Football Club, after joining its under-15 squad eight years ago.

Club manager Nigel Welch described him as a “star” and a “super lad” who was the “heart and soul” of the club.

Team mate Daniel Mobsby-Brown said the defender was “smitten” with his young family.

The 33-year-old added: ‘Scott had a lovely daughter and was engaged to marry his long-term girlfriend.

‘He spoke about them all the time, and they would always come and watch him play.

‘He was a loving, caring, family man, who was smitten with them.

‘His death will be a devastating loss for his family, and I can’t imagine how they will be feeling right now.

Blackmoor Estate has a long-standing reputation for growing both traditional and new varieties of English apples, pears, plums.

The fruit farm was established in the 1920s and the estate boasts more than 250 acres of orchards.

Thanks to significant investment in recent years, the packhouse has more than 2,000 tonnes of refrigerated and controlled atmosphere storage and two apple graders.

Blackmoor packhouse has a reputation for high-quality storage and service and has won numerous awards for long term storage of Cox, Bramley and Gala apples.

It won the Marden Fruit Show Society prizes for long term storage of Gala last year, and the packhouse manager won the best store manager award.

‘It’s also a tragedy for everybody that knew him.’

The local business man said that Mr 
Cain had been engaged to his fiancé for several years but the couple had
 to put the wedding off while they saved up.

A neighbour described Mr Clarke, who lived with his girlfriend Rachel in Bordon close to the farm, as a “devoted son”.

She said: ‘He was a lovely man, I’ve 
known him since he was just a boy and it is absolutely tragic. He was 
saving up to marry his girlfriend next year.’

A friend said that amateur rugby 
player Mr Clarke had found Mr Cain unconscious in the huge chiller and 
collapsed himself as he tried to revive him.

Mr Clarke played as a back row forward for Portsmouth-based rugby team Southsea Nomads.

Club chairman Martin Drum said: ‘He 
was a smashing lad. One of the best and bravest rugby players you could 
ever wish to have. He was so well loved by everyone at the club.

‘He comes from a lovely family. When everyone finds out there will be a lot of devastated people around.

‘He played as a back row. Whenever he
 went down on the floor or got hurt he would always get straight back up
 and carry on with a big smile on his face.’

Tributes were left at a makeshift shrine in front of the store at the farm.

Mr Cain’s devastated brother left a 
bunch of flowers with a note reading: ‘Remembering a Dearest Brother 
Scott. I will always love and remember you x.’

The results of initial post-mortem examinations on the workers have proved inconclusive.

The coroner is now awaiting the results of toxicology tests to find out how Mr Cain and Mr Clarke died.

An inquest is due to be opened and adjourned on tomorrow morning.

North East Hampshire coroner Andrew 
Bradley said: ‘The farm workers were going into the apple store, which 
is kept cool by nitrogen, to look for apples.

‘We don’t know what happened after 
that - I presume they were overcome by fumes and the absence of oxygen, 
but we can’t be sure yet.’

Fruit can be kept fresh through controlled atmosphere storage, which regulates temperature, oxygen, carbon dioxide and humidity.

Typically, the ripening process is 
slowed by storing fruit in sealed rooms, where oxygen levels are reduced
 by the infusion of nitrogen gas.

Blackmoor packhouse has a reputation 
for high-quality storage and service and has won numerous awards for 
long term storage of Cox, Bramley and Gala apples.

The estate’s packhouse was not in use
 last night and it is not clear when it will be operational again, a 
National Farmer’s Union spokeswoman said.
