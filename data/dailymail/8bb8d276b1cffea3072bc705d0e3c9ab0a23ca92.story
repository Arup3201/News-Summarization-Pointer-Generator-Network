A Russian scientist believes a remote Siberian rock formation may be the first place that humanity began to follow the movements of the heavens.

Sunduki, known as the Siberian Stonehenge, is a series of eight sandstone outcrops on a remote flood plain on the bank of the Bely Iyus river in the republic of Khakassia.

Professor Vitaly Larichev, of the Institute of Archaeology and Ethnography at the Siberian Branch of the Russian Academy of Sciences, claims that the 16,000-year-old site was not only a place of huge religious significance in the ancient world, but also its stargazing capital.

Each of the eight peaks are have 
stones like giant boxes or chests perched on top. The word 'Sunduk' in 
Russian means 'chest' or 'trunk' which explains how the place got its modern name.

'For
 many years I tried to unravel these mystery 'chests', said Professor 
Larichev, who became an 'astro-archeologist' in his bid to unravel the 
site's mysteries.

'We don't dig in the ground - we study what ancient people knew about astronomy', he said.

'What
 I discovered was a surprise even to myself. Comparing maps accumulated 
over many years of astronomical observations, I came to understand that 
here in Sunduki, we can see the oldest astronomical observatory, certainly in Asia.

By using a central point of reference, our ancestors  could have used the landscape to mark the passage of the sun and moon

As well as the movement of the heavenly bodies, the mountains could have been used to align north and south

'Its age is about 16,000 years old. The ancient inhabitants of this valley daily observed the sunset, the sunrise and the moon'.

Yet the professor thinks these ancient Siberian astronomers, without any instruments, used giant rocks and chinks in the stone architecture in the landscape for their calculations and observations.

He claims to have found 'numerous ancient solar and lunar observatories around Sunduki'.

Speaking to the Siberian Times, he said: 'This square pattern of stones on the ground shows you the place.

'I knew there would be an orientation point, but we had to search through the grass for a long time to find it.

'Now look up to the top of that ridge. You see a place where there is a crack between the rocks?

'If you were here on the summer solstice, you would see the sun rise right there. Or you would if you were here 2,000 years so. Now the timing is slightly different'.

High on one cliff wall is a rock engraving showing dragon heads pointing in one direction, and snake heads the other, something ancient people would have used to tell the time by using the sun.

Professor Larichev added: 'In the morning the shadow moves along the snake's body from his head to his tail, and in the afternoon it comes from the other direction along the dragon.

'From the same observation point you can determine true north and south by sighting along the mountains.'

There is also rock art at the site and a mysterious white horse symbol found not far from the first 'chest' may have appeared 16,000 years ago, during the Ice Age.

But the site has not yielded all its mysteries. There are also burial mounds and other man-made constructions - including irrigation channels - which have yet to be fully explored by archaeologists.

Professor Larichev believes Sunduki is the oldest astronomical observatory certainly in Asia and perhaps the world

Ancient observatories were far more than just ways of measuring time and following the paths of heavenly bodies. Anthropologists claim the sites would have combined many aspects of what the ancients believed and how they saw the world.As well as observatories, they may have been used as tombs, temples and even homes. Here are some of the most famous.

The Torre√≥n, Machu Picchu, PeruThe tower in this Incan city - built around 1460 - has a stone that is lit up as the sun shines through one window on the June solstice. Around the same time, this window also frames Pleiades star cluster, which was used by the Incas to decide when to plant potatoes. Gaocheng, ChinaThe country's oldest surviving observatory was built in Henan Province around 1276 by renowned Chinese astronomer and engineer Guo Shoujing. It was used for time-keeping and mapping the stars. Astronomers there calculated the length of the year to within 26 seconds - three centuries before Europeans managed it.

On the June solstice at dawn, the sun rises over a 'heelstone', as viewed from the middle of the monument. Scientists think Neolithic and Bronze Age cultures saw some kind of sacred significance in the solstice
