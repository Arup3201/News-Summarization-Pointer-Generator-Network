People go house hunting with specific criteria in mind – from a certain number of bedrooms or a country-style kitchen to a spacious garden with room for a trampoline.

But few are likely to specify that they must have a hidden spaceship inside their home.

However, for people looking to battle aliens in their attic, a £3.25million ($5.35million) house in London could be the answer to their home-hunting woes.

This elaborate playroom lets people fight aliens from the attic. Kit reminiscent of many popular (slightly retro) sci-fi films has been installed from numerous boxy computer monitors and flashing lights to mysterious air vents and pipes

The 7,000 square foot house in south east London has eight bedrooms, a music and games room and most notably a spaceship playhouse in the attic.

The Rightmove description of the property reads: ‘A sizable area of loft storage has been transformed into an amazing spaceship for the kids.’

The multi-million pound mansion is located in between Crystal Palace and Gipsy Hill in south east London and is describe by estate agents as a 'beautiful Victorian family home'

‘Rockmount’ house is a Victorian villa and ‘a sublime example of one of the best suburban villas on Church Road,’ according to the estate agents.

‘The imposing Gothic Grade II listed house also boasts self-contained accommodation, double garage, off-street parking for several cars, a wonderful garden and detached lodge,’ they said.
