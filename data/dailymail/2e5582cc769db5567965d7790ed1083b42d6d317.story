John Donne may have one of the most famous English poets of the 17th Century, but today no one really knows what he sounded like.

His sermons, delivered in the courtyard of St Paul’s Cathedral, drew some of the largest and most influential crowds in the country.

Now researchers in the U.S. have attempted to bring Donne’s sermons back to life by reconstructing the acoustics of the courtyard as it was in 1622.

Researchers at North Carolina State University have combined scholarship and new technologies to re-create the courtyard of St Paul's Cathedral in London as it stood in 1622

‘This is as close as you can come to visiting 17th century London and hearing John Donne speak without a time machine,’ said Dr John Wall, a professor of English at North Carolina State University.

The project aims to answer some longstanding questions about religion and literature in 17th century London.

‘We know that large crowds showed up to hear Donne’s sermons, but it was unclear whether they could even hear what was being said,’ said Dr Wall.

John Donne was an English poet, satirist, lawyer and a cleric in the Church of England.

He was an important religious and political figure in 17th century London.

Due to the Reformation and its aftermath, religion and politics were inextricably linked in England during this period.

As dean of St Paul’s Cathedral, Donne was a prominent man – and his sermons were often made in defense of royal policies, to the most influential crowds in the country.

‘By using the models we created for this project, we learned that the courtyard space allowed sound to reverberate, amplifying the voice of the speaker.

‘This also means the sermon had to be delivered at a measured pace to keep the speech from being garbled as the reverberating sounds overlapped.’

The reconstruction focused on Paul’s Cross, which a freestanding outdoor pulpit where crowds would gather to hear sermons on Sundays and special religious days.

As dean of St Paul’s Cathedral, a focal point of social, political and religious life in the largest city in England, Donne’s sermons were often made in defence of royal policies.

And it was from Paul’s Cross that Donne preached a sermon, on November 5, 1622, that is recreated by the project itself.

Dr Wall and his team had to rely on historic documents and images, since the cathedral burned to the ground in 1666.

They also worked with linguistics and acoustics experts to create a script and acoustic model able to simulate the way the sermon would sound depending on where you are in the churchyard.

‘We actually constructed two separate models: one for visual representations and one for audio representations,’ Dr Hill said.

‘The visual model shows a greater amount of the architectural detail that is common to Gothic cathedrals.

‘The sound model has acoustical properties like reflectance and absorption assigned to the various materials, such as stone, glass or brick.

‘These are things that may not be visually apparent in the model, but they contribute to an accurate portrayal of sounds within the space.’

While researchers may never know what Donne sounded like, Dr Wall hopes his models will help recreate the experience of Londoners attending the sermons nearly 400 years ago.

The project, which is a significant research tool for history, literature and religion scholars, is available online and can also be viewed in a theatre at North Carolina State University
