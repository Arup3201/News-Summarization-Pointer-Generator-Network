Bookmakers Paddy Power will have to examine their flawed publicity strategy after a series of failed stunts caused widespread upset rather than generating interest.

Their latest limp effort was hiring a second plane to follow the ‘Moyes out’ flypast over Old Trafford. It carried the message ‘Fergie back in 6-1’, which created little stir and wasn’t considered worthy of comment by United afterwards.

This follows Paddy Power’s crass betting market on the Oscar Pistorius murder verdict and sending rainbow laces to football clubs trying to hitch cheap publicity on to the serious anti-homophobia issue.

Flawed: Paddy Power flew a plane over Old Trafford home of Manchester United. The banner read 'Fergie Back in 6/1' and it was not well received

Good idea? Paddy Power sent out rainbow boot laces in partnership with gay rights charity Stonewall, to tackle homophobia in football

Tranmere manager Ronnie Moore, suspended
 by his club after Sports Agenda revealed he was being investigated by 
the FA for betting irregularities, has finally been charged, six weeks 
later, for multiple breaches of Rule E8(b) in relation to betting in 
competitions involving Tranmere.

Paddy boast about having a ‘mischief department’ to dream up their tired ideas, with employee Harry Dromey, son of Labour frontbencher Harriet Harman, even having the title of ‘mischief champion’ on his business card.

A spokesman said: ‘We do irritate people, but our ambition is to entertain and the United banner did well on social media, which is what we wanted. We will keep having fun when it works.’

The good news is that Paddy Power are not planning any ambush marketing during this week’s Grand National meeting.

Malky Mackay’s £2.5million compensation case against Cardiff is expected to be heard by a Premier League managers’ arbitration tribunal in May if mediation fails. The League Managers Association believe Mackay, who was sacked for ‘imprudent and careless’ management, has a strong case as all his transfers were signed off by the chief executive.

Strong case: Malky Mackay will have his case heard against Cardiff later in the year

Cardiff point especially to the failure of £8m striker Andreas Cornelius, who was sold back to FC Copenhagen for a £5m loss after 11 games without scoring. Cornelius is back among the goals.*************************************************The Football League’s annual jolly to Portugal for their summer meeting could be volatile, with a number of Championship teams furious that fines for breaching financial fair play are going to charity rather than being divided among law-abiding clubs.

The League say clubs agreed the charity element when they accepted Premier League solidarity payments subsequent to the ballot on financial fair play. ECB’s inside edge *************************************************

ECB's inside edge

Ashley Giles would be fortunate to be appointed full-time England coach this month, given his woeful record. Nevertheless the interview panel of ECB chief executive David Collier, cricket managing director Paul Downton and Gordon Lord, head of elite coaching development, are likely to favour an insider.

Giles hasn’t shown any sign during 17 months in charge of the one-day and T20 sides that he is capable of improving England’s cricketers.

But word inside Lord’s is that the ECB would be loath to pick a foreign coach after all the investment in national coaching programmes. Yet someone like Yorkshire’s Australian coach Jason Gillespie appears to have a lot more motivational flair than the wholly uninspiring Giles.

Lucky: England coach Ashley Giles has not impressed with the Twenty20 side at the recent tournament

Barnsley may be fighting to avoid relegation from the Championship, but standards at Oakwell are still such that the Kuwaiti ownership group from Nottingham Forest were refused entry to the boardroom because they weren’t wearing ties.

The Forest delegation had to go to the club shop to buy suitable neckwear before being allowed in.

NBC have followed Manchester City personnel for 36 hours pre-match as part of their 36 series which will be broadcast by ITV on Tuesday. It’s no wonder the Premier League have embraced the arrival of the American network when NBC boss Mark Lazarus told club chairmen it would be a sign of success if they had to double their £200m rights contract in the next tender.

Screen star: Yaya Toure and his Manchester City team-mates are subject of a NBC documentary

Meanwhile, the fact Sky are screening Liverpool’s next four games — and probably the last two as well — shows BT Sport were outmanoeuvred throughout the picks process.
