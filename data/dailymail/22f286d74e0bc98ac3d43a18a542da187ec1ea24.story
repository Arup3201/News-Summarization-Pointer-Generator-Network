An inventor has gone to extreme lengths to combat bad hair days by designing a special cap that dampens down loose locks.

Entrepreneur Max Valverde, 29, from Massachusetts, created the product for people who wake up with an untameable hairstyle in the mornings.

He discovered that the only way to fix bed hair was to have a shower or wash it in the sink, and came up with a bizarre hat to solve the problem.

Bed hair: The extreme sportsman has invented a spongy shower cap to combat his untameable locks

The Morninghead invention, which is shaped like a shower cap, is made of an absorbent material that acts like a sponge when it is placed under a tap.

It doesn't leak or drip and dampens hair in seconds, smoothing down unwanted kinks, lumps and bumps without any mess.

It is ideal for men and women and can solve a number of dilemmas, including hat hair and helmet hair.

Once the hair is wet it can be dried and combed into place.

Max Valverde, 29, from Massachusetts, US, said: 'I shower every night after I go mountain biking or rock climbing and every morning I wake up with horrible bed hair.

Style it out: Entrepreneur Max Valverde claims the cap helps abolish flyaway hairs and tame tresses

'I would either have to take another 
shower, which was wasteful and time consuming, or wet my hair in the 
sink which never really worked properly and made a mess.

'After
wetting my hair in the sink for more than ten years, I spent a weekend 
trying to find a way to wet your hair and cure bed head the quickest and
most effective way.

Smooth: If slick and polished is the look you're going for, this could be for you

'I needed to find a material that could hold a lot of water and then subsequently only release that water when pressure was applied.

'You add water to the interior of the cap and wait a couple seconds for that water to be absorbed by the cap.

'You then put it on your head, rub it around for a few seconds and your hair is then wet as if you just towelled off after a shower.'

Max uploaded his idea to a Kickstarter, a website which raises money for small projects, and after two days he was donated enough to launch his product.

He said: 'Our main users are people who shower at night, parents getting their kids ready for school, and motorcycle and bicycle commuters.

'It can also be used on people who take naps, people with hat hair or really anyone who has ever wet their hair in the sink.'

The cap costs Â£6.50 from morninghead.com
