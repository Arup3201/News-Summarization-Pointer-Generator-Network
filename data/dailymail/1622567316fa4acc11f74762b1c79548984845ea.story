Manchester United's ever-increasing portfolio of unusual official sponsors just got weirder after stars Robin van Persie, David de Gea and Adnan Januzaj were roped in to advertise a range of Korean meatballs.

Perhaps the threesome were being punished for the club's most unsuccessful season in Premier League history, especially as none seemed able to raise a smile during some acting so wooden it deserved to carry a fire warning.

The players were filmed going through a few moves inter-spliced with shots of some rice/pasta accompanied dishes that look as if they could have come straight from the picture menu of a downmarket takeaway.

Dutch courage: Robin van Persie goes through the motions for another unusual United sponsor

Not fair! Youngster Adnan Januzaj had a good enough debut season not to be punished this way

Yummy! The Samboo Korean meatballs don't look the most appealing of three-minute meals

In safe hands: David de Gea struggled to raise a smile while expanding the club's Asian market

But, the most embarrassing moment is reserved for the end when all three players are forced to stare into the camera and announce 'We love Samboo!' (meaning three-minute meals).

Since the Glazers gained control of United, the club has collected an expanding list of sponsors you may not usually associate with a football club.

These include: Mister Potato (Official Savour Snack Partner), Aperol Spritz (Official Global Spirits Partner), Kansai Paint (Official Paint Partner), Zong (Official Communications Partner in Pakistan), and Apollo Tyres (Official Tyre Partner).
