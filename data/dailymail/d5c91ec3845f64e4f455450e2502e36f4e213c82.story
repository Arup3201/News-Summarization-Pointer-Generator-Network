A man was shot on live television by LA County sheriff's authorities Friday afternoon.

The man, whose identity is unknown at this time, was being pursued by deputies for kidnapping and driving in a stolen vehicle when he stopped the chase after thirty minutes and got out of his car.

This after almost hitting several bystanders. 

He then began walking towards police and waving a gun, at which point he was hit when several shots were fired by police.

It is being reported that the suspect, who is still alive and at a local hospital where his condition is unknown, fired at police first.

The suspect was then taken from the scene in an ambulance as neighbors reportedly cheered for him and chanted his name.

Before this however, he was stripped of all his clothing so his wounds could be examined and to make sure he was not carrying any weapons. 

The kidnapping charge stemmed from a March 8 incident in which the man  was accused of taking his wife of two years and pistol whipping her,  Lt. Eddie Hernandez told KTLA.
