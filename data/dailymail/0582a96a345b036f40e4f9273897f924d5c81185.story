Fashion designer John Galliano has lost his £10 million case for unfair dismissal by Dior after he was sacked for making anti-Semitic slurs.

The 54-year-old was suspended and later fired as creative director at the prestigious design house after a damning video emerged of him telling a woman whom he thought was Jewish that he 'loves Hitler' and that her parents should have been 'gassed'.

He admitted two counts of making anti-Semitic insults in public at a court in the French capital in June 2011, following two separate incidents in the restaurant in the Marais, the historic Jewish district of Paris.

Video nasty: Filmed in December 2010 at restaurant La Perle, the video shows Galliano nursing a drink while sitting alone at a table, and then referring to the Nazi Holocaust

Filmed in December 2010 at restaurant La Perle and uploaded the next February, the video shows Galliano nursing a drink while sitting alone at a table, and then referring to the Nazi Holocaust.

Galliano says to two unnamed Italian women : ‘People like you ought to be dead, your mothers, your forefathers would all be ****ing gassed. I love Hitler.’

When one of the women asks ‘Do you have a problem?’, Galliano replies: ‘With you, you’re ugly.’ The same woman says : ‘Where are you from?’, and Galliano replies: ‘Your ****hole’.

One of their male companions started videoing the incident because he was so shocked. 

At his one day trial in June, 2011, he admitted two instances of making anti-Semitic and racist comments and that September was given two suspended fines totalling 6,000 euros.

The court was told he had abused museum curator Geraldine Bloch about being Jewish dduring a trip to the cafe in February 2011, as well another incident the previous October.

Judge Anne-Marie Sauteraud said the low damages and fine reflected his lack of previous convictions, and attempts he had made to overcome his drug and alcohol addiction. 

He told the court: 'They are not views that I hold or believe in. I apologise for the sadness this whole affair has caused.'

Despite his 15 years at Dior, he lost his job after the video emerged, costing him up to £10million in lost earnings, according to his lawyers.

Dior owners had LVMH cited a zero-tolerance policy on racism and anti-Semitism, while actress Natalie Portman, one of the faces of the brand, was among those outraged by his remarks.

At the time the Oscar-winner said: 'In light of this video, and as an individual who is proud to be Jewish, I will not be associated with Mr Galliano in any way.

'I hope at the very least these terrible comments remind us to reflect and act upon combating these still-existing prejudices that are the opposite of all that is beautiful.' 

Following a drawn-out claim for unfair dismissal from the designer, a Paris employment court has now rejected it.

In a judgement handed down late on Tuesday, judges ordered him to pay a symbolic one euro to both Dior and the John Galliano label,which is still owned and run by LVMH, the world's biggest luxury group.

Chantal Giraud-van Gaver, Galliano's lawyer, said her client was 'very disappointed' by the ruling, and might appeal.

A graduate of London's prestigious Central Saint Martin's College, Galliano was famous for his theatrical, romantic shows at Dior as well as for his creative designs for his own-name brand.

In 2001 he was made a Commander of the British Empire, and received his award from the Queen at Buckingham Palace that November.

Since losing his job at Dior,  Galliano has undergone treatment for drugs and alcohol and worked briefly as a designer for New York fashion brand Oscar de la Renta in 2013.

Last month he was hired as creative director of Belgian brand Maison Martin Margiel, which described him as one of the 'greatest undisputed talents of all time'.

Galliano's latest collection for his new label is due on the Paris runway in January.

John Galliano transcended his humble roots to become one of the most powerful men in fashion.

The Gibraltar-born designer, pictured, who once defined style as wearing 'an evening dress to McDonalds', grew up in south London the son of a plumber who had come to England looking for work.

He has often mentioned the influence of his Spanish mother who dressed him and his sisters in immaculately pressed and starched clothes whenever they left the family home.

He worked as a dresser at the National Theatre and threw himself into the London club scene - experiences that left their mark on his sense of style.

But it was as a student at the capital's Central Saint Martins College of Art and Design that he was first noticed with a degree collection influenced by revolutionary France.

He was a runaway success but became disillusioned with the British fashion scene after a financial backer withdrew support, and moved to Paris in 1990.

Five years later he was appointed head of Dior - the first Englishman to head one of France's fashion flagships.

The news sent shockwaves through the fashion world but did not seem to affect the supremely confident Galliano.

His long-time creative collaborator Amanda Harlech once described disagreeing with him, saying: 'I did only once and I can only compare it to being hit by a massive surfing wave. His indifference was absolute.'

His confidence brought him celebrity supporters with actresses including Charlize Theron and Marion Cotillard wearing his designs. 

He also designed Kate Moss's dress for her wedding to Jamie Hince in July 2011 after asking him while he was still at Dior.
