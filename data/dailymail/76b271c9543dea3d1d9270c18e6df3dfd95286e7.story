Augmented reality firm Blippar has unveiled the world's first image recognition and tracking app for Google Glass wearers that show videos, webpages, and more, simply by looking at a picture.

These so-called Blipped images can be printed on products, papers, magazines, and on bus stops, for example, and as users move their eyes around, the content can move to remain in that wearer's line of sight.

Blippar CEO and co-founder Ambarish Mitra made the announcement during a discussion about the future of mobile technology at Mobile World Congress in Barcelona.

The Blippar app is already available on 
iOS, Android, Windows Phone and Blackberry devices, but it currently 
requires getting a phone out of a pocket, opening the app and pointing 
the camera at the image.

Today's announcement is the first time the technology can be used automatically, and seamlessly, just by looking at an advert.

Blippar doesn’t produce the content, it 
is the software that recognises the images and links that with a 
pre-programmed video, for example.

Google Glass with Blippar could look at an advert for foundation, for example.

The camera on Google Glass could be used
 to scan the wearer’s skin tone and the system could
 recommend which shade will suit them best.

‘This is a very exciting time for Blippar and a pivotal moment for the augmented reality industry as a whole,’ said Mitra.

‘We’re proud to announce that Blippar is actually the first to build a fully functioning, proof of concept to share with the world.'

Blippar doesn’t produce the content, it is the software that recognises the images and links that with a pre-programmed video, for example. 

Mitra told MailOnline another way the technology could be used is with makeup adverts.

‘Google Glass with Blippar could look at an advert for foundation, for example. 

The camera on Google Glass could be used to scan the wearer’s skin tone and the system could recommend which shade will suit them best.

‘Google Glass is a promise that can only be fulfilled by companies such as Blippar. It’s very much like Minority Report. This is a completely new race.’

Google has banned facial recognition with its Glass product and MailOnline asked Mitra how he will guarantee users won’t abuse the app to bypass these restrictions. 

‘Blippar is capable of facial recognition but we disable it by default,’ said Mitra.

‘Brands can’t turn pictures of people into Blippable images, for example, with the existing app and this will continue with Google Glass.’

The concept is similar to the technology seen in the film Minority Report (a still, pictured). In a recent report, Juniper Research announced that the number of people using augmented reality globally is predicted to rise from 60 million, at the end of 2013, to over 200 million by 2018

This isn’t just a technology that companies can use to advertise their products, either. The Blipp Builder can be used by anyone on a web browser to turn a photo of anything, other than faces, into a Blippable image.

Blippar was recently used to turn the front of Shortlist magazine in London into a playable game on mobiles. Blipped images are also printed on every can of Pepsi in the U.S to play promoted videos.

The demo presented at Mobile World Congress also showcased other areas of image recognition technology Blippar has been developing including faster recognition, and lower battery usage.
