What is white and bulbous, has no leaves or roots, grows under the ground and blooms mysterious and spectacular pink flowers?

It may sound like a riddle, but the answer is quite straight forward; a bizarre and extremely rare orchid that has  only been found at ten locations in New South Wales.

The Eastern Underground Orchid – or Rhizanthella slateri- is one of three plants in the country that does not require chlorophyll to survive according to Greg Steenbeeke, a senior threatened species officer at the NSW Office of Environment and Heritage.

An Eastern Underground Orchid: The rare plant has no roots or leaves and grows underground

'It differs from most orchids in having no chlorophyll. It can't produce its own sugars and is entirely reliant on a fungus that infects it to bring water and nutrients to it,' Mr Steenbeeke told Daily Mail Australia.

'The plant grows underground and the flower is presented at the surface of the soil amongst the litter.'

The orchid is made of only a number of tubers – think tiny potatoes – under the ground, from which a white 15cm-long and 1.5cm-wide stem extends and produces a glistening flower that appears only just above the surface of the ground.

'The flower they produce is in a dense head, a bit like a Warratah but only as big as a 20 cent coin. The flowers themselves are a creamy white colour and translucent with purple spots within the flower,' Mr Steenbeeke said.

'It existence is highly cryptic given that it grows almost completely below the soil surface, and therefore is usually located only when the soil is disturbed.'

Samples of the plant, which is classified as 'vulnerable' due to the threat of its extinction in the long term, have been sent to Leiden in the Netherlands for genetic testing where a specialist will determine how it relates to other non-photosynthesising plants.

'This research is important because the orchid's habitat requirements are poorly understood and no particular vegetation type has been clearly associated with the species, although it is known to occur in some NSW forests and flowers September to November,' Mr Steenbeeke said.

'The plants have certainly been driven through their evolutionary history to adopt this method of living as a means of surviving. A plant producing no parts above the ground isn't going to be losing a lot of water because water is lost through leaves, so therefore it can be considered a way of saving water - but it's a pretty drastic way to save water.'

There are currently another three other orchid species in Australia that do not require chlorophyll to grow, two of which are found in West Australia while the other two have only been found in the eastern states.

'They are distinguished either by where they occur or the shape and character of their flowers. This is the first one to be sent to the Netherlands, but one other of its species has had its DNA sampled as well,' Mr Steenbeeke said.

While different underground orchid species have been found in other parts of the world, Mr Steenbeeke explained that 'while they are widespread, there are not a great many of them that have this life form'.
