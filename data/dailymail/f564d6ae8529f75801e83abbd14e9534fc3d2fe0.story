In name at least, he is the former president of the Board of Control for Cricket in India (BCCI). But N. Srinivasan stole the show at the meeting of the cricket body's working committee in Kolkata on Sunday.

The meeting lasted for almost three hours and paved the way not only for Srinivasan's return as president of the BCCI, but also his re-election at the body's September annual general meeting (AGM).

It was announced in advance that Srinivasan wouldn't attend Sunday's meeting, but even then he was the talking point throughout it.

Triumphant return? BCCI sources say N. Srinivasan (left) may soon be back in charge after the commission appointed to examine fixing claims against his son-in-law Gurunath Meiyappan (right) found him guilty only of betting

Hours before the meeting began, BCCI 
secretary Sanjay Patel had received the report of the commission set up 
by the board to investigate the spot-fixing scandal that had rocked the 
sixth edition of the Indian Premier League (IPL) 6.

The commission consisted of former Madras High Court judges Jayaram Chouta and R. Balasubramaniam.

Sneered
at by Srinivasan's critics even before it began the probe, the 
commission was called eyewash by those opposed to Srinivasan, who said 
that the BCCI would close ranks against 'foreign interlopers'.

On Sunday, critics vented their frustrations again.

"Friends time to move on. With people so
hungry to hang on to there chairs and will stop at nothing. Justice and
judicial process mocked- sad," [sic] tweeted former IPL chief Lalit 
Modi, following it up with: "Seen the Bcci decisions. All I can say is i
am glad i am not part of this lame duck absolutely shameless 
organisation anymore."

While a final decision on the 
president's position will be officially taken only after the IPL 
Governing Council (GC) meets in the Capital on August 2, a senior BCCI 
official told Mail Today that the report has absolved Gurunath 
Meiyappan, team principal of Chennai Super Kings, of fixing allegations 
while finding him guilty of the relatively minor offence of betting.

The
Rajasthan Royals and its co-owner Raj Kundra have also been given a 
clean chit, thereby paving the way for Srinivasan's return to the hot 
seat sooner rather than later.

"The
secretary received the report in the morning and it was tabled in the 
post-lunch session. With the Mumbai Police refusing to depose before the
panel, the commission couldn't make much headway into the allegations 
of fixing levied against Meiyappan and Kundra. All that they could 
establish was charges of betting against Meiyappan. But not much will be
made of it," the official said.

He
went on: "While the report has been handed over to Arun Jaitley, he is 
set to go through the findings ahead of the IPL GC meeting on Friday, it
is just a matter of time before Srinivasan is back at the helm of 
affairs. Basically it was felt that it is only proper that the final 
call is taken in the IPL GC meeting as the matter involves IPL."

The
official further revealed that the findings of the report were obvious 
once the police had refused to depose before the commission, making 
Srinivasan's position stronger and weakening any claims against him.

"Mumbai Police had refused to 
co-operate with the commission, so there was no way in which the 
commission could have pointed finger at any of the accused. So at no 
point was Srinivasan under any threat. Also, it wasn't a case of him 
stepping aside because he was directly involved in any illegal activity.
He had stepped aside as his son-in-law had been accused of wrongdoing. 
So the moment it was clear that the police wouldn't depose, the road for
Srinivasan returning to the hot seat was clear," he said.

The official clarified, however, that Srinivasan would in all likelihood not chair the working committee meeting on August 2.

"The Working Committee is set to meet
post the IPL GC meeting, but it is unlikely that Srinivasan will chair 
that meeting. It seems that he will wait till his name has officially 
been cleared by the Board before he takes over responsibilities from 
interim chief Jagmohan Dalmiya," he said.

Even Dalmiya refused to divulge much when it came to who would chair the meeting on August 2.

"Let Srinivasan take his decision," is all the interim chief said.

Mail Today has learned that N. Srinivasan signed the appointment letters for new BCCI interim secretary Sanjay Patel and treasurer Ravi Savant

When N. Srinivasan famously 'stepped aside' from day-today working of the BCCI at the June 2 working committee meeting, following the IPL spot-and match-fixing scandal, some key board officials raised a pertinent question: who installed the new BCCI secretary and treasurer following the resignations of Sanjay Jagdale and Ajay Shirke?

That question now has an answer. Mail Today has learned that Srinivasan signed the appointment letters for new interim secretary Sanjay Patel and treasurer Ravi Savant several days after critics accused the BCCI of ignoring its own constitution.

At the acrimonious working committee meeting on June 10 in New Delhi, the house passed a resolution, authorising Srinivasan to sign the appointment letters.

"In fact, five resolutions were passed at the Delhi meeting, and two of them related to the new appointments. One resolution was about the appointment of the secretary and treasurer and other was that Srinivasan would sign the letters," a top official told Mail Today.

"The second resolution said that Srinivasan, 'exercising his rights as per the BCCI constitution', would issue the appointment letters to Patil and Savant," he said.

Senior Board officials like I.S. Bindra, C.P. Joshi and G. Vinod questioned the "invalid" route taken by Srinivasan to 'step aside', after Delhi cricket chief Arun Jaitley suggested this "unconstitutional" way, as Bindra termed it, to give the beleaguered BCCI president the much-needed relief.

Srinivasan, who was under tremendous pressure because of his son-in-law Gurunath Meiyappan's alleged involvement in the fixing scandal, was not present at the Delhi meeting.

In his absence, Jagmohan Dalmiya, after being vehemently opposed by Bindra and Joshi, was elected to chair the working committee meeting.

Hyderabad Cricket Association president G. Vinod also protested, saying that he was not aware of the steps that led to Srinivasan stepping aside.

Even as the two-member probe commission submitted its report to the BCCI on Sunday, a top board official told Mail Today that the Mumbai police did not depose before the panel.

"The Mumbai police didn't depose before the commission as they felt that it didn't have any legal standing," he said.

But the Mumbai police claimed that they had written to the BCCI regarding the legal position of the commission and hadn't received a reply from the board.
