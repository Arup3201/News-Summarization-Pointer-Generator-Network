An army officer and seven soldiers have been detained in connection with the killing of 22 gang members in rural southern Mexico.

The incident was originally portrayed as a 'fierce gun battle', but physical evidence from the scene suggests that the killings had been summary executions.

Journalists at the site found splattered blood marks, indicating that at least some of those who died had been shot at around chest level as they were standing against a wall.

The Mexican Defense Ministry said the eight men were under a form of detention pending investigation of the June 30 killings in the town of Tlatlaya.

They were being held at a prison in Mexico City on charges of crimes against military discipline, disobedience and breach of duty.

Shortly after the confrontation, the army reported that 22 suspected criminals had been killed in a firefight with troops. But just one soldier was wounded, raising questions.

At the time, a spokesman for federal prosecutors said all the dead - 21 men and one woman - were believed to be gang members.

The shooting started after soldiers came under fire from the suspected gang members, resulting in a gunfight lasting several minutes, the government said. 

When the Associated Press visited the scene soon after the killings, there was no sign of a prolonged battle. 

Journalists found evidence, including blood spatters on walls, that suggested not a battle but a one-by-one killing of the gang members. They found few spent bullet casings that would have been typical of a battle.

Last week, a woman who says she witnessed the events told the AP that only one person died in the initial confrontation, and the rest were shot after surrendering. 

The witness said the dead included her 15-year-old daughter, who had been wounded in the leg and was lying on the ground when she was killed.

The U.S. State Department and international rights groups recently expressed concern and called for an investigation. 

The statement said the military charges are being pursued 'independently of the investigations that civil authorities are carrying out under their jurisdiction'.

The federal Attorney General's Office, which is conducting its own probe of the killings, had no immediate comment.

Raul Plascencia, president of Mexico's National Human Rights Commission, reserved comment, saying the Defense Department statement was not clear on the soldiers' connection to the killings.

Plascencia's commission is also investigating the case.

Recent reforms require that alleged military offenses against civilians be tried in civilian courts, but nothing appears to bar the military justice system from pursuing its own charges. 

'In relation to the events that took place on June 30, 2014 ... (the attorney general's office) affirms that there is an investigation into what took place,' a statement from the attorney general's office said.

'A complete and thorough investigation is needed to get to the truth,' it added.

In a separate statement, the army said it had every interest in a deep investigation and that it would cooperate completely.

'The army and air force are obliged to conduct themselves with the full respect for human rights,' it said.

Mexican President Enrique Pena Nieto came to office in December 2012 pledging to quell gang violence that has killed more than 100,000 people since 2007.

Total homicides are down in Mexico since he took over but the death toll has risen in some places, like the State of Mexico - Pena Nieto's home state.
