'How can you NOT see white and gold?'

That was Nine Network presenter Leila McKinnon's fiery broadside at the smaller percentage of the population who, as far as they are concerned, believe this dress is blue and black. 

Some of the country's most well known figures have come out guns blazing about whether 'The Dress That Broke The Internet' is black and blue, white and gold or something else entirely. 

Network 10 personality and journalist Sarah Harris was equally passionate as her Channel Nine colleague. But the dress she saw was much darker.

'WITCHES! YOU'RE ALL WITCHES! #blueandblack,' she tweeted, aligning with the smaller proportion of the world's population who see darker shades.

Network 10 presenter Sarah Harris was strident in her opinions: the dress is blue and black

As the debate raged, even the citizens the country turns to for important insight at moments such as these were unable to give us a straight answer on the true colour of the dress.

'We don't know why different people see it differently, don't know that one yet,' said science guru Dr Karl Kruszynski on 702 ABC Sydney.

Dr Kruszynski, who was busy obtaining a spectrometer to find a straight answer, said he saw a blue and brown dress. 

'I see the main body of the dress being a light blue colour and then I see the little whispy patterny things as being a browny goldy colour,' he told presenter Richard Glover.

Glover fired back: 'You're mad, Dr Karl, it's white'.

According to reports, Opposition Leader Bill Shorten saw white and gold

It's still unclear whether the nation's politicians are as divided as they usually are.

Opposition Leader Bill Shorten reportedly believes the dress is white and gold, but there was no news on where Prime Minister Tony Abbott stands as of time of publication. 

Typically, plenty of Australians took the time to make a joke out of the phenomenon.  

Richmond football club changed the colours of the dress to resemble its famous black and yellow. '#whiteandgold?' they questioned. 'We can only see yellow and black.'

And film critic Marc Fennell joked the optical illusion furore would end up as an advertisement for an eye charity.  

'You wait. This whole Dressgate thing is gonna end up being a viral campaign for the Fred Hollows foundation'.
