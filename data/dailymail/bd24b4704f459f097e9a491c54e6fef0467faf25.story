A New Mexico woman and her boyfriend locked up an 8-year-old girl with developmental disabilities in a wooden cage and then left her alone while they headed out to watch a movie, police said on Tuesday.

Police say Cindy Patriarchias, 33, and Edmond Gonzales, 37, of Las Cruces, took her three children to see a movie at an elementary school on Friday but before leaving their mobile home locked away the little girl.

Officers responding to the home after a call from Patriarchias' estranged husband, who was also at the school, discovered the child locked in a large homemade wooden cage in the corner of a bedroom.

'The arriving officer who peeked in there thought he'd be seeing a pet, a dog possibly, but as it turns out it turned out to be this young, 8-year-old,’ said Dan Trujillo, a spokesman for Las Cruces Police Department speaking with KVIA.

The cage had two latches on the door, a baby crib's mattress inside and was about 2.5 feet wide and 4 feet inches tall, police said in a statement.

‘It did have vents and it was made out of wood. It was obviously homemade,’ Mr Trujillo said. ‘It had like vents up along the top. She had already out grown this if you will. She was already too tall for it.'

The girl didn't appear to have any physical injuries, police said and it wasn't known if she had been kept inside before.

Patriarchias is not the biological mother of the girl according to police but has been trying to adopt the little girl who suffers from
microcephaly, a condition giving her the mental capacity of a 
2-year-old as well as a smaller-sized head.

Patriarchias hadn't been able to reach the girl's birth mother to get her consent for adoption, a police spokeswoman said.

The girl was placed under the care of New Mexico's child-protection agency.

Patriarchias has been charged with negligently causing child abuse. Gonzales was charged with negligently permitting child abuse.

Court records indicated that they appeared in court on Monday but didn't enter pleas.

Patriarchias and Gonzales were being held $25,000 cash-only bonds. It was unclear if they had hired attorneys.
