A report has revealed that one in five crimes goes unrecorded due to failures by police

One in five crimes goes unrecorded because of  failures by police.

Up to 740,000 victims of  violence, burglary and other offences are being denied justice, a report revealed yesterday.

One rape was not logged because the officer thought it would be too much work. An attack on a boy with autism was written off as ‘sexual experimentation’.

The report by Her Majesty’s Chief Inspector of Constabulary piles pressure on forces already under fire for Plebgate, Hillsborough and the abuse of stop and search powers.

It said the sheer number of unresolved crimes meant some officers had to be guilty of ‘discreditable or unethical behaviour’.

And the investigation reinforces warnings from statisticians and MPs that crime figures cannot be trusted.

Spelling out the human cost, the report said: ‘Victims are failed because the crimes against them are not investigated, they have no hope of justice according to the law.’

The unrecorded rape case led to accusations of laziness from campaigners.

‘This is about much more than inaccurate statistics or poor number-crunching,’ said Adam Pemberton of Victim Support. ‘Each mistake represents a victim losing their chance to get justice and to access support services.

‘It is completely unacceptable that victims of any crimes – let alone serious sexual offences such as rape – should have their complaints go unrecorded or downgraded because of police incompetence or even laziness.

‘Most victims want more than anything for their offender not to commit another crime, but if the police can’t reliably recognise and record when and where a crime has been committed, their efforts to cut crime may well be misdirected.’

Police ignored a complaint made on behalf of a female rape victim by a doctor who had examined her injuries.

A report of several assaults by a member of staff at a care home on teenage victims went similarly unrecorded.

Home Secretary Theresa May said: ‘I commissioned HMIC to carry out this investigation in order to get a detailed assessment of how the police are treating recorded crime statistics. HMIC’s interim report exposes unacceptable failings by the police.

‘It is quite possible, once HMIC has completed its work on recorded crime statistics and made recommendations on how the police need to improve, that we will see an increase in recorded crime.’

She pointed out however that offending was at its lowest level since 1981.

Inspectors carried out checks on 13 police forces and listened to phone calls made by members of the public.

These were checked against police records to see if the incidents had been properly logged.

Out of a sample of 3,102 incidents, HMIC found 2,551 crimes should have been recorded, but 523 were not, including sexual offences, crimes of violence, robbery and burglary and even 14 rapes.

HM chief inspector of constabulary, Tom Winsor, says the consequences of under-recording of crime are 'serious'

The watchdog said the figures suggested 20 per cent of crimes may be going unrecorded. Last year, police recorded 3.7million offences.

The inspectors said: ‘In the light of what we have so far found it is difficult to conclude that none of these failures was the result of discreditable or unethical behaviour. The failure rate is too high.’

HM chief inspector of constabulary Tom Winsor said: ‘The consequences of under-recording of crime are serious, and may mean victims and the community are failed.’

The report comes after serious concerns were raised over the integrity of crime figures, sparked by claims made by former Metropolitan Police officer James Patrick last year.

Mr Patrick told MPs that massaging crime figures to hit performance targets had become ‘an ingrained part of policing culture’.

Police forces inspected so far are Cheshire, City of London, Devon and Cornwall, Essex, Gloucestershire, Greater Manchester, Gwent, Hertfordshire, Metropolitan, Norfolk, North Wales, North Yorkshire and South Yorkshire.

The remainder will be checked ahead of a final report in the autumn.

POLICE wrongly allowed more than 50,000 hardened criminals to dodge court last year, the report reveals.

In around 400,000 cases, offenders guilty of violence, drug use, yobbery and other offences escaped with a caution, penalty notice, cannabis warning or ‘community resolution’.

But inspectors found that in one in every seven cases this had been a mistake. Out-of-court disposals are supposed to be used for low-level crimes committed by first- or second-time offenders.

But police were doling them out to convicts with long histories of law-breaking.

It is yet another example of victims of crime being failed, Her Majesty’s Inspector of Constabulary found.

In many cases, victims were not consulted or told how their attacker would be  punished.

The report said offenders ‘were given out-of-court disposals when their offending histories ought to have precluded the imposition of such a disposal’.

It went on: ‘In some of these cases, the offender ought to have been charged or summonsed to court.’

Shadow home secretary Yvette Cooper said ministers should stop community resolutions being used for serious crimes.
