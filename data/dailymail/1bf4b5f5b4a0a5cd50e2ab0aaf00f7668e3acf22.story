Top solicitor: Helen Dugdale, 44, who is a partner at DDE Law who specialise in drink-driving cases, was banned from the roads for 18 months

A solicitor who specialises in defending 'loophole-style' motoring cases was banned from the road herself after being caught drink-driving in her Mercedes.

Helen Dugdale, 44, was arrested in her own driveway after a passer-by spotted her driving erratically and called police.

The single mother wiped her eyes with a handkerchief at Manchester Magistrates Court today as she pleaded for a lesser driving ban claiming it would have a detrimental effect on her family life and 'dent' her reputation.

Dugdale - a partner at a Liverpool law firm who regularly defends clients facing traffic charges - was disqualified for 18 months, fined £800 and ordered to pay £650 costs.

She must attend an awareness course for convicted drink drivers.

'I don't intend to say anything about the offence itself - your line of work you know all about it,' district judge James Prowse told her.

'It has cost you your good character. The submissions made to me don't fall on deaf ears. I'm aware that the disqualification will hit you harder than most people.

'You and must attend a drink drivers awareness course. As somebody of previous good character you are an ideal candidate. I remind everybody of the serious consequences of driving whilst disqualified.'

Dugdale is a partner at Castle Street-based solicitors DDE Law and has worked as a solicitor on Merseyside for around 20 years.

She has helped a number of the region's charities with free independent legal advice.

On the DDE Law website she is described as having a 'niche speciality' in motoring law with a 'vast knowledge' of dealing with drink driving cases.

She also specialises in representing clients accused of serious crime including murder, manslaughter and driving offences, and one of her cases was featured on the late-1990s BBC TV documentary Mersey Blues.

Dugdale generally covers cases from the Knowsley area and frequently represents clients at Liverpool and Knowsley magistrates' court. She also carries out work on cases where police seek to recover assets.

The incident occurred on July 12 after a member of the public saw Dugdale coming out of Schmooze Wine Bar in Allerton, and walking to her dark grey Mercedes.

Mr Roger Brown prosecuting said: 'The witness was concerned that she was staggering and holding on to the car in order to move herself along. The witness was so concerned that they telephoned the police.'

Police traced the owner from the registration plate and arrested her at her home in Mossley Hill, Liverpool.

'I don't intend to say anything about 
the offence itself - your line of work you know all about it,'

On arriving they saw Dugdale on the drive smelling of alcohol and noticed the car's engine was warm, along with other signs that it had recently been driven.

She failed a breath test and was asked to step into their patrol car.

When tested, Dugdale had 76 microgrammes of alcohol per 100 millilitres of breath. The maximum legal limit is 35mg.

Dugdale initially denied drink driving but pleaded on the day of trial.

Her barrister Mr Harpreet Sandhu said in mitigation: 'She has been entirely co-operative. In so far as aggravating factors in this driving there is nothing.

'As far as the disqualification period is concerned she is somebody who will be badly affected both personally and professionally.

'She knows she has nobody to blame but herself. But she is a single mother to an eight-year-old child and she has an elderly and ill mother who lives in very close proximity and is reliant on her.

'She has lost her good character and there will be a sizeable dent on her reputation.'
