A group of demonstrators have interrupted a performance of the St. Louis Symphony to protest the shooting of Michael Brown. 

Several dozen people, all said to have tickets, held up banners and sang to draw attention to the death of the 18-year-old who was shot and killed by police officer Darren Wilson in Ferguson, Missouri in July.

During the intermission the group, who were said to be part of an organized demonstration, sang 'justice for Mike Brown is justice for us all'.

Peaceful demonstration: Protesters unveil banners at Powell Hall in St. Louis, Illinois, to protest the shooting of schoolboy Michael Brown at the hands of Darren Wilson in July 

The St. Louis Post-Dispatch said demonstrators flung three banners from a balcony in Powell Hall, St Louis, Illinois, related to the schoolboy's shooting.

The newspaper reports that the interruption was met with applause from some members of the audience and the symphony.

One said on Twitter that they 'incidentally had beautiful voices'.  

Symphony publicist Erika Ebsworth-Goold told KMOX-TV and the Post-Dispatch that the protesters were ticketed members of the audience.

Ebsworth-Goold added that though she was backstage at the time, she could hear the singing and the demonstrators 'had lovely voices.' 

The symphony was performing Brahms' 'German Requiem' before the demonstration began. 

Respect: The protest was reportedly met with applause by some members of the audience inside the venue 

The protest ended with participants leaving voluntarily. St. Louis Police say they received no calls about the demonstration.

Hundreds of people have been arrested during nearly two months of protests in Ferguson, the scene of the shooting, including journalists and clergy members.

The incident comes amid volatile outbursts in the city, where citizens and the Department of Justice are accusing police of failing to take action to repair racial divides. 

Protesters want Darren Wilson, who is white, to be charged in the killing of the unarmed, black 18-year-old. A grand jury considering the case isn't expected to rule for at least another month. 

A civil rights group and several clergy said Friday that police overreached when arresting 13 protesters outside the Ferguson station. 

Pause: The musicians looked up towards the balcony as the peaceful demonstration took place
