A McDonald's Sausage Burrito certainly promises to fire you up for the day, with more than 100 ingredients including one chemical compound used in fireworks.

A new behind-the-scenes video reveals that although the liquid egg in the sandwich originates from a farm in Michigan, it is mixed with twenty other components before flash frozen and reheated at restaurants.

Among the scrambled egg mix is carboxymethyl cellulose - a binding compound found in denture adhesives  - and sodium benzoate, which is also used in fireworks to produce a whistling sound.

Tasty treat? A McDonald's Sausage Burrito certainly promises to fire you up for the day, with more than 100 ingredients including one chemical compound used in fireworks

Both ingredients are commonly used in the processed food industry as a cheap way of thickening and preserving goods.

The other components of the McDonald's breakfast burrito include 'pre-cooked sausage crumbles.' Thankfully the brown-colored nodules do contain pork. 

But the niblets are blended with various other substances including propyl gallate - an antioxidant preservative also used in a wide variety of vanity products, including lipsticks and shower gel.

After the egg and pork is combined, a layer of  processed American cheese is melted on top.

Main supplier: The eggs used in U.S. McDonald's come from Herbruck Poultry Ranch in Michigan

Soy lecithin - which some suggest triggers weight fluctuations and gastrointestinal problems - is added to the milk, cream, water and 'cheese culture' blend, in a bid to stop the cheesy slices from getting stuck together in storage. 

Finally, the egg, sausage and cheese is wrapped up in a tortilla wrap by chefs. 

In a bid to extend the shelf life of the flour product, a number of preservatives are added during the factory baking process. 

And hey presto, a McDonald's Sausage Burrito is served.

The finished breakfast meal  contains 300 calories, 12 grams of protein and 790 milligrams of sodium - more than one third of the recommended daily intake.

McDonald's is striving to be more transparent about what goes into its products with ingredients and nutritional values clearly listed on its website. 

It recently launched an online video series titled 'Our Food. Your Questions' in a bid to boost its performance in the U.S., where sales slid at established locations in the last quarter of 2014.

In addition to increased competition, McDonald's is trying to keep up with changing tastes, with places such as Chipotle marketing their food as more wholesome alternatives.

To improve the image of its food, McDonald's recently rolled out chicken wraps with sliced cucumbers and the option to substitute egg whites in breakfast sandwiches.

It also plans to eventually let people swap out the French fries in value meals with options like salad or vegetables.
