A courageous young girl who was told she would never walk again after being diagnosed with leukaemia at the age of two is set to dance in her first ballet exam.

Olivia Careless, now seven, promised her mother she would learn to dance - even after discovering the harsh chemotherapy she was undergoing has seriously damaged her leg bones.

Despite her devastated parents fearing the worst - a determined Olivia battled and beat the illness and was able to keep to her word by joining a ballet school. 

Courageous: Olivia Careless, who was diagnosed with leukaemia at the age of two, fulfilled her promise to her mother by learning to dance despite doctors saying she may never walk again

Her mother Sarah, 34, who lives in Hull, said: ‘We are so incredibly proud of Olivia. When I watch her dancing it brings tears to my eyes.

‘She never forget her promise to me as she lay in her hospital bed that she would learn to dance. I never thought it would be possible as her legs bones had been so damaged by the treatment.

‘But she has pushed herself to get better and she was so determined to learn to dance.

‘Now that she is studying for her first ever ballet exam I’m so proud. It’s something I never thought I’d see.’

Olivia, now seven, was diagnosed with leukaemia in July 2009, after being told by doctors there was nothing wrong with her - despite numerous trips to hospital and her GP over the previous six months.

Miss Careless added: ‘She had started being unwell the Christmas before. I took her in and out of hospital as she kept getting rashes. On Christmas Day I took her to hospital and they told me she had mumps.

Battle: As a result of her aggressive chemotherapy treatment, Olivia developed osteoarthritis and her bones became so weak that her leg broke when her mother was changing her nappy

‘Then another time they gave her steroids as they thought she’d had an allergic reaction as her lips had swollen with a rash.

‘But nothing seemed to help her get better. She was so exhausted all the time. Two year olds should have so much energy, but she was lethargic constantly.’

Then one day after discovering bruises all over Olivia's body, Miss Careless took her to the GP and he referred her straight to hospital for blood tests.

It was then that doctors discovered she was suffering from Acute Myeloid Leukaemia. They told her parents that had they left her the symptoms unchecked for a couple more days then Olivia would have died.

Miss Careless said: ‘Our whole world came crashing down around us. All these months that she’d been unwell and she actually had cancer. 

Determined: Despite the devastating effects of her illness and treatment, Olivia pushed herself towards fulfilling her dream of learning to dance

'It was terrifying. She was only two years old, and yet we were being told she had cancer.

‘I’m just thankful that it was diagnosed that day, as had we left it a couple more days she may not have survived.’

Olivia had to have immediate chemotherapy treatment. She lost her hair and suffered from severe high temperatures.

Miss Careless adds: ‘It was awful to watch her go through the treatment and feel helpless to do anything to help her. 

Miss Careless said: ‘The doctors told us that her bones were so frail that she may never walk again'

'She was in so much pain, the doctors had to pump her full of morphine. She had abcesses on her liver, spleen and stomach and she lost so much weight.’

In March 2010 Olivia started her second course of chemotherapy treatment and three months later her leg bones were so frail that when her mother was changing her nappy, her leg broke.

Doctors diagnosed the condition as osteoarthritis and said it was a result of the aggressive chemotherapy treatment.

Miss Careless said: ‘It broke my heart to see her lying there with her plaster casts on her legs. The doctors told us that her bones were so frail that she may never walk again.’

She started on treatment to try and strengthen her legs in summer 2011 and she also had physiotherapy too.

Miss Careless said: ‘It was agony for her trying to learn to walk. But there was one thing she wanted to do. When she said to me "mummy I want to dance when I’m better," it broke my heart. I never thought it would be possible.’

Olivia took her first steps in summer 2011 and since then she has come on in leaps and bounds. She finished her treatment in December 2012 and now she is in remission from her cancer.

Miss Careless said: ‘We are thrilled that the treatment has worked and she has beaten the cancer.’

And in July Olivia fulfilled her promise to her mother - by joining a dancing school. She has now just started training for her first ballet exam.

Miss Careless said: ‘She absolutely loves her dancing and it was very emotional when she went for the first time.

‘She pushes herself so much, and never gives up. She finds it tiring sometimes but she never complains. She’s our little hero.

‘When she was lying there with her plaster casts on her legs, I never thought dancing would be possible for her. So to see her now in her ballet shoes is an amazing sight.’

Leukaemia is the most common form of blood cancer in children. The condition affects the body's white blood cells, which help fight infection.

Acute lymphoblastic leukaemia (ALA) and acute myeloid leukaemia (AML) are forms of cancer which affect blood-producing cells in the bone marrow.

When a child has leukaemia, control of blood cell production breaks down. The bone marrow - the soft tissue in the middle of our bones where all our blood cells are made - makes lots of abnormal white blood, or leukaemia cells.

These never mature into proper white blood cells, vital to a healthy immune system, and so children with leukaemia are at more risk of infection.

The cure rate for children with acute myeloid leukaemia (AML) is now around 65 per cent.
