The French anarchist accused of wounding a photographer in a Paris shooting spree had been convicted of domestic violence in Britain shortly before returning to France, it can be revealed today.

Abdelhakim Dekhar, who is facing charges of attempted murder in France, was convicted in January of assaulting an ex-partner in Watford, Hertfordshire.

He was sentenced at St Albans 
Magistrates' Court to wear an electronic bracelet, carry out community 
service and follow a curfew for six months while staying at an address in Aylesbury.

He was also ordered to stay away from his ex-partner, a Latvian student named as Valentina A - who he attacked in September last year - and their two boys, born in 2004 and 2006.

Assaulted ex-partner: Paris 'shotgun shooter' Abdelhakim Dekhar, seen here on CCTV at the Concorde underground station, was convicted of domestic violence in Britain before returning to France

His sentence ended on July 16, 2013, after which he went to France.

He lost an appeal in October and was ordered to pay £400 (480 euros/ $650) in legal fees.

'The
rejection of his appeal on October 16 and, therefore, the definitive 
nature of his domestic violence conviction, may explain his decision to 
stay in France,' Newspaper Liberation wrote.

Dekhar,
48, was arrested on November 21 after a major manhunt following a 
shooting at Liberation, a left-wing newspaper, that left a 
photographer's assistant seriously hurt, and a separate incident where 
shots were fired at the headquarters of the Societe Generale bank.

He
is also accused of having hijacked a car during his escape and of 
having a few days earlier threatened staff with a gun at the Paris 
headquarters of 24-hour television news channel BFMTV.

Address: The block of flats in Ilford, Essex, where Dekhar is listed as having lived between 2000 and 2003

Accomplice: Dekhar was jailed for four years for supplying a gun to France's infamous 'Bonnie and Clyde' murderers Florence Rey, left and Audry Maupin, right, who 
murdered three policemen and a taxi driver

Earlier this week, it was reported he had gone on hunger strike in prison.

Dekhar
had moved to Britain in 1998, after serving a sentence in France for 
his role in a famed 'Bonnie and Clyde' style shoot-out with police in 
Paris in October 1994 that left five dead.

Dekhar was convicted of having bought a shotgun used in the 1994 attack by student Florence Rey and her lover Audry Maupin.

Liberation
also reported that Dekhar had in 2000 married a young Turkish student, 
Gamze Aras, and that the couple had lived in Ilford northeast of London.

Dekhar
has refused to cooperate with police but his DNA has matched samples 
found at the scene of the attacks. In letters found after the attacks, 
Dekhar railed against capitalism and accused the media of being involved
in conspiracies.

Dekhar fled to England in 1999 to escape surveillance by French authorities after he served four years for supplying a weapon to revolutionaries Florence Rey and Audry Maupin - nicknamed 'France's Bonnie and Clyde' - who murdered three policemen and a taxi driver.

Danger: The gunman aims his weapon and fires during an attack on a French television station BFM TV

He worked in London and married a 
student in Redbridge in 2000, listing his address as a small flat close 
to Ilford Methodist Church.

He continued to live in England, where he also worked in a restaurant until July this year.

His sister Farida Dekhar-Powell still lives in the Essex commuter town of Shenfield and teaches French.

She said: ‘I stopped talking to him 20 years ago. He is not part of my life and that's how it stays.’

Dekhar
was arrested in an underground car park after taking
an overdose of sleeping pills in Bois-Colombes, a Paris suburb.

It
was the dramatic end to a manhunt that started when 
Dekhar allegedly critically wounded a photographer at the offices of Liberation 
newspaper in Paris.

He is then said to have 
opened fire on the offices of the Societe Generale bank in La Defense 
business district of Paris, before briefly taking a motorist hostage.

Intent: CCTV from inside the television station captures the moment the gunman, dressed in a black sleeveless top and carrying a large dark sack, calmly walks down the stairs towards the reception

Close range: The wanted man gets to within a few feet before firing the shotgun

Escape: The suspect, who was described as white, in his 40s and shaven-headed, fled the scene

Dekhar's DNA matched genetic prints found on the shotgun cartridges the gunman used and the car he commandeered.

Police said they
found letters written by Dekhar which referred to Islamism and 
conflict-ravaged Arab countries including Libya and Syria.

He also attacked the media and capitalism in general, saying they were both part of a ‘fascist plot’.

Dekhar
spent four years in prison for buying a gun used in the 1994 attacks 
by Florence Rey, a 19-year old student, and her lover Audry Maupin, who 
murdered three policemen and a taxi driver.

Mr
Maupin died in the chase, while Miss Rey, a fresh-faced student from a 
middle-class family, claimed Dekhar was the ‘third man’ in the ‘Bonnie 
and Clyde’ killing spree.

Dekhar,
nicknamed ‘Toumi’ was under surveillance at the time, because of his 
links with a variety of radical groups, including would-be Islamist 
terrorists.

Witnesses
at the trial in 1998 described him as a mentor to the couple and 
accused him of exploiting their youth to manipulate them.

In
the early 1990s he was known to hang out at squats that were used by 
left-wing radicals and were often under police surveillance.

Despite
this, it took detectives three days to track Dekhar down following the 
attacks, suggesting the French authorities had lost track of his 
movements.

The 
23-year-old photographer wounded in the attack has since 
undergone a six-hour operation and is expected to recover.
