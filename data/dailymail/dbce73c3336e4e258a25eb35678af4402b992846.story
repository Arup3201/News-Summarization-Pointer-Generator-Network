A woman who torched her council home just a fortnight after moving in because she 'didn't like her new neighbours' - comparing her new estate to TV show Shameless - has been jailed.

Wenman has more than 80 previous convictions, most of them for dishonesty

Leesa Wenman moved into her new home in Harlow, Essex, at the end of July last year after being rehoused by Harlow District Council – but in under a fortnight was having rows with neighbours.

Chelmsford Crown Court heard how the 32-year-old was arrested soon after her flat burst into flames on August 6 - just a fortnight after she moved in.

The court heard how neighbours called 999 when they spotted plumes of smoke coming out of Wenman's flat window and that it took firemen 30 minutes to douse the flames, which caused £20,000-worth of damage.

Neighbours believed that Wenham, a mother-of-one, was still in the flat and broke down the door to rescue her. But she had climbed out of the window after starting two fires in her bedroom and gone to stay with a friend in Stile Croft a mile away - but was arrested soon afterwards.

Carolyn Gardiner, prosecuting, told the court that Wenman was 'not happy' with her new home and said she had argued with neighbours just before the blaze started.

She told the court: 'Neighbours smelled smoke, it smelled like plastic was burning. They realised Wenman's flat was on fire.

'This defendant had motive – she had fallen out with her neighbours.'

Neighbour Kerry Roche told the court that Wenman had told her she hated living in the new house 'within a week' of moving in, saying she told her she 'did not get on with the neighbours'.

Another neighbour said Wenman had told her it was 'like living in the Shameless estate but worse'.

The jury heard how two fires were started in the bedroom, with investigators finding burn marks on the floorboards and skirting board.

Chelmsford Crown Court was told Wenman has more than 80 previous convictions, most of them for dishonesty but 19 for failing to obey court orders and she was jailed for 30 months.

Neighbours, speaking last week after Wenman was jailed on September 25, said Wenman had said the estate was 'disgusting' and compared it to the fictional Chatsworth council estate in the TV show Shameless.

One, who asked not to be named, said Wenman had told her she 'hated the place' within a week of moving in.

She said: 'Leesa said the estate was disgusting and said it was like the estate on Shameless.

'She was not happy about being moved here at all and made it very clear she wanted to get out.'

Wenman would have been sentenced to seven years in jail but for her diagnosis of Huntington's Disease in 2009. Both her father and her older sister have the condition and are now in care homes.

Clare Dowse, defending Wenman, said: 'The diagnosis is a devastating one and particularly for a young woman because, as is well known, it is a disease which is progressive and eventually fatal.

'She must now face the fact that the disease is not going to go away and there's no cure for it so she has to await the same fate as her sister.'

Miss Dowse added: 'The defendant's concern is that while she serves any sentence her physical condition may deteriorate to the extent she will not recognise her daughter, who is 10 soon, or interact with her when she is released.'

She said that Wenman had been in foster care from her early teenage years and at the age of 13 she started drinking and taking drugs, stealing to feed both those habits.

Judge Anthony Goldstaub said that he was reducing her prison term due to her illness.
