At Christmas, a little bit of effort goes a long way when it comes to giving presents.

But great-grandmother Doreen Gover went the extra mile this year - by knitting 28 matching festive jumpers for three generations of her family, including her dog.

Mrs Doreen, 78, spent up to eight hours a day and used 250 miles of wool making the red sweaters for her four children, nine grandchildren and ten great-grandchildren.

She made the jumpers for three generations of her family - and even knitted one for her springer spaniel called Cookie.

She told The Daily Mirror: 'It was just for fun. It was something fun for me to do to pass the time, and it put a big smile on everybody's face.

'I love my family, and I really enjoyed doing something that has made them so happy. The girls got snowmen and the boys got reindeer, but some of the girls wanted reindeer.'

At first she knitted a 'couple of jumpers' but then began receiving requests.

Son-in-law James Spoors, 48, told the paper: 'It's a lot of time and effort. She's doing really well. You'd just hear the clicking of her needles when she was doing them.

Mrs Gover took up knitting when her husband Roy died 14 years ago.

She said she is already planning on what to create for next Christmas, but regretted starting with jumpers as she is 'not sure what I can knit for everyone now.'
