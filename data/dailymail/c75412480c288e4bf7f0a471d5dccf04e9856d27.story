Charge: The N-Dubz star allegedly took part in an early-hours brawl

N-Dubz rapper Dappy has been charged with affray after a fight at a petrol station left three men with serious facial injuries.

The singer was arrested on March 12 following the incident on the forecourt of a Shell garage in Woodbridge Road, Guildford, in the early hours of February 28.

Dappy and a 27-year-old man allegedly approached two women and three men and asked the women to go with them.

When they refused, one of the rejected men allegedly spat at one of the girls.

A fight then allegedly broke out between Dappy and his friend and another group of up to six men.

Surrey Police said the singer was charged under the name Dino Costas Contostavlos at a police station last night.

Three other men have also been charged with affray in relation to the incident.

Surrey Police named the men as Kieran Patrick Vassell, 24, of Hammersmith, London, Kalonji David Stewart, 31, of Harborne, Birmingham, and Alfred James Miller, 27, of Brentford, Middlesex.

All four have been bailed to appear before Guildford Magistrates’ Court on Thursday, May 24.

Dappy, who performed in N-Dubz alongside his cousin and X Factor judge Tulisa Contostavlos, and Richard ‘Fazer’ Rawson, has recently seen success as a solo artist and recorded with Queen guitarist Brian May.
