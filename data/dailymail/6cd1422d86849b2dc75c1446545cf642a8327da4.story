Stuart Broad wasn't exactly looking his best when England lined up for the official photocall ahead of England's fifth Test against India.

The batsman sustained a broken nose at Old Trafford in the previous Test, and is still wearing the battle scars.

His large plaster across his face bore uncanny resemblance to 1980s pop sensation Adam Ant.

Set to play: Despite the nasty injury and two black eyes, Broad is expected to feature against India on Friday

He's clearly been taking it all in good stride, tweeting a picture of Batman and Bane earlier this week.

Broad will follow the example of footballers such as Paul Gascoigne and wear a protective face mask to ensure that he can play in the final Test at The Oval.

The nasty blow Broad took when he top-edged a bouncer from Varun Aaron into the gap between the peak of his helmet and grille during England’s thumping fourth Test win looked to have ruled him out.

But he emerged from a Manchester hospital and ruled out reconstructive surgery before insisting he will be fit to play, complete with a mask, on Friday.

Broad was absent from the nets at The Oval on Wednesday but was able to practice with England on the eve of the fifth Test against India, sporting a nose splint. 

The 28-year-old was the first to have a bat on Thursday but didn't face any pace, only spin and throw-downs. He had to wear a different helmet to the one he had on when he edged a delivery from Aaron which squeezed between grille and peak in Manchester,

Broad also bowled, working up to full pace, as England still hope he will be fit to participate in the fifth Test on Friday when they will attempt to turn their 2-1 advantage into a series victory over India.

Confident: England captain Alastair Cook believes Stuart Broad should be available for the final Test on Friday

Captain Alastair Cook sounded confident about Broad's well-being, having watched him practise.

‘We think he's going to be absolutely fine,’ he said. ‘We reserve the right tomorrow morning, in case something unusual happens overnight. (But) we're not expecting anything like that at all.’

The only apparent uncertainty is over which protective covering Broad may yet choose when the match gets under way.

‘He batted, he bowled his six or seven overs and didn't get any pain from it,’ said Cook.

‘So we're expecting him to be absolutely fine, and see what mask he pulls on tomorrow. I don't know what's been going on ... but there have been quite a few masks.

‘I'm not quite sure if he's just going to wear it when he's batting, or if he's bowling, but I honestly don't think it's going to affect his performance at all - which is good.’
