The number of families losing their home to repossession is at the lowest level in eight years as people benefit from low interest rates and strong job growth.

Properties taken back by banks and building societies in the first half of this year dropped to 11,800, the smallest number since 2006, figures from the Council of Mortgage Lenders (CML) found.

There was also a fall of 23,500 in the number of owners with arrears of 2.5 per cent or more of their balance, taking the figure down to 131,400, which is the lowest level for six years.

The news will add to growing feel-good factor around the economy and family finances with evidence people are finding it easier to juggle their must pay bills.

Figures published earlier this week showed positive news on jobs with unemployment down to its lowest level since 2008.

Home buyers have also been given an assurance from the Bank of England that there is no likelihood of any increase in interest rates from the current historic low of 0.5per cent until next year at the earliest.

While mortgage holders will welcome that news, there is evidence that many young people are taking on supersize loans to get the keys to their first home and they will be particularly vulnerable when interest rates do go up.

The CML director general, Paul Smee, said buyers do need to ensure that their finances can cope with a rise in mortgage repayments when they do come.

He said: ‘Another fall in arrears and possessions is clearly welcome and shows that borrowers, lenders and money advisers are generally continuing to work well to contain payment problems where they arise, helped by an improving economy and low interest rates. But rates will rise at some stage, of course, and borrowers should be planning for that now.

‘We welcome the message from the Bank of England that, when it raises rates, it plans to do so in a series of ‘baby steps’, matched to a careful assessment of the ability of households to deal with higher borrowing costs.

‘Any borrower anticipating payment problems should talk to their lender as soon as possible. Today’s figures continue to show that in many cases it is possible to work through a period of difficulty, with lenders committed to helping borrowers get their finances back on track.’

Earlier this week, the Governor of the Bank of England, Mark Carney, suggested house price rises will fall back next year. Recent surveys put the current increase at more than 10per cent a year, however Mr Carney believes the figure will be closer to six per cent in 2015.

The Bank suggests that new mortgage affordability tests coupled with restrictions on the size of loans allowed will see a reduction in new mortgage approvals, taking some heat out of the market.

A survey published by the Royal Institution of Chartered Surveyors yesterday(thrs) reported that the number of people looking new homes has fallen back for the first time in 18 months.

An overall balance of five per cent of surveyors reported demand for homes falling rather than increasing in July, marking the first net decline in buyers coming to the market seen since January 2013.

London surveyors have the lowest expectations in the UK for house price growth over the next 12 months, typically putting the percentage increase at 1.9per cent. Higher increases are expected in East Anglia, as well as Wales and Scotland.

Property economist, Matthew Pointon, of Capital Economics, said: ‘The economy is growing at a robust pace and the labour market data showed that the unemployment rate has dropped to its lowest since December 2008. But weak pay growth and cautious lender behaviour will help bring house price inflation down to a more sustainable rate over the remainder of the year.’
