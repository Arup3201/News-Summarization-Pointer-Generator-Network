A Japanese porn star who underwent so much plastic surgery that she ended up looking like Harry Potter's pet elf Dobby has defended herself against her critics.

Rina Nanase says people who dubbed her Dobby because of her similarity with the house elf from the Harry Potter books are just jealous of the surgical shaping she has undergone.

The 25-year-old actress, who goes under the name Rumi Kanda in her adult videos, made no secret of her decision to cosmetically alter her looks.

In a process that she began chronicling via Twitter late last year, Nanase has made a number of changes to her eyes, nose, and chin.

Now that she has shared photos of her 'finished' look, however, many are calling it 'way too much'.

On a picture of her aged 17 which she posted online, she wrote 'I look fat' and said she had 'beady eyes'.

The model then shared another photo, looking back at what she considers her 'idol era prime.'

The photos were shared as she was undergoing a nose lengthening procedure.

Adverse reaction: Nanase says she didn't feel it was a particularly big change and was surprised by the negative response to her new look

Nanase says that she didn't feel it was a particularly big change, but was surprised at the reaction she got from followers.

A photo tweeted earlier this month earned her the Dobby nickname.

On social media sites there was little in the way of positive comments for her new look.

One wrote: 'She looked great before, the person before the surgery was very nice.'

Another added: 'Does she have an eating disorder?'
