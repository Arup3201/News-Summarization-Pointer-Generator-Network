Two Mormon missionaries found dead in their Taiwan apartment on Saturday died of carbon monoxide poisoning, said New Taipei police today.

Yu Peng Xiong, 24, a Taiwan native, and Connor Benjamin Thredgold, 19, of Springville, Utah were discovered dead in their apartment after police went to check up on them after Mormon missionaries reported them missing.

Both were serving in the Taiwan Taipei mission, reported FOX.

Focus Taiwan reports that prosecutors found a faulty indoor water heater which caused a carbon monoxide leakage.

There was no foul play involved, say police.

The New Taipei Fire Department issued a warning to the public that carbon monoxide poisoning can happen any time of year, not just during the cold months.

It's a hazard in the summer because people keep their windows closed to keep in air from the air conditioner.

Family members of Connor Benjamin Thredgold said that their son will be missed but that he was 'happy' in Taiwan and said that he loved all of the people there and made close friends.

'We pray for their families and for all those who knew them and express our love and deepest sympathies at this tragic time,' said a statement from the church.

Connor Benjamin Thredgold is the only one from the Thredgold family to go abroad for a mission trip.
