He got off, whilst driving off!

When police in Philadelphia tried to arrest a man for openly masturbating in the street, he wasn't going to come easily.

Charles Dockery led cops on a high-speed chase through the streets of Upper Darby before crashing his car.

Charles Dockery, 36, was found sitting in the passenger's seat of his car with the door open and no pants or underwear on

As he tried to escape on foot, a tube of KY Jelly fell out of his car.

Upper Darby Police Superintendent Michael Chitwood said police began receiving calls around 6pm on Tuesday about a man exposing himself to passersby.

Police were greeted by the site of Dockery, 36, sitting in the passenger's seat of his car with the door open and pleasuring himself with no pants or underwear on.

As police came to arrest him, Dockery attempted to get out of the sticky situation by jumping into the driver's seat and droving. As he did so, he almost ran over an officer.

During the chase, two other cars were struck along with a third parked car.

When Dockery jumped out of the car, the KY Jelly fell to the floor.

Dockery was arrested and charged with open lewdness and aggravated assault on police.

'I'm sure the KY jelly is being held for evidence,' said Chitwood to the Philadelphia Inquirer. 'I don't think we did a forensic exam on his penis.'
