He was arrested and fined $29,500 for shoplifting underwear from a Dillard's store.

But Dallas Cowboys running back Joseph Randle will no longer struggle for intimate garments after signing a deal with MeUndies.

The 22-year-old landed the contract in a bid to atone for his crime, revealing he will donate $15,000 of the brand's apparel to children in need. 

Dallas Cowboys' Joseph Randle was arrested for shoplifting at a Dillard's department store in Frisco, Texas

Randle, 22, was arrested on Monday and released after posting £220 bail on Tuesday morning

'There is no excuse for my mistake last week, and I take full responsibility for my actions,' Randle said, via ESPNDallas.com. 

'I let down my coaches, teammates, and family. 

'My agent and I have spent a lot of time looking for ways I can turn my situation into a learning experience for young people. 

'Partnering with MeUndies allows me the opportunity to give back to others less fortunate than myself, and spread a positive message of not making the same mistake twice.' 

Randle, who signed a four-year, $2.35 million contract last year, was charged with Class B misdemeanour theft of underwear and cologne between the value of $50 to $500.

Police attended the Dillard's store at Stonebriar Mall in Frisco, north of Dallas, at 8.17pm, after the young NFL star was detained by security staff. 

A police spokesman told the Dallas Morning News that Randle tried to take a pack of two black Polo underwear valued at $39.50  and a small bottle of Gucci Guilty Black cologne priced at $84.

The running back is accused of trying to steal underwear worth £25 and cologne priced at £53

Randle, whose base salary this season is $495,000, was released from custody on Tuesday morning after posting bail of $350, police confirmed.

Although behind DeMarco Murray in the Cowboys' pecking order, Randle played a key role in their side's win over defending Super Bowl champions Seattle on Sunday.

Against the league's top rushing defence, Randle rushed for 52 yards in their 30-23 win at CenturyLink Field.

Randle came to the Cowboys as  a fifth-round draft pick from Oklahoma State in 2013 and it is hoped he can take pressure off Cowboys' workhorse superstar Murray.
