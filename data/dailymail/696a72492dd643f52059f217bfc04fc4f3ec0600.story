A ban on assault weapons has been struck from the U.S. Senate's gun control bill, leaving out a major portion of gun control legislation that's due to be revealed next month.

Sen Dianne Feinstein, the sponsor of the ban, announced the decision by Senate Majority Leader Harry Reid today. The gun control bill will be debated by the Senate next month.

Instead, Feinstein said she will be able to offer her ban on the military-style firearms as an amendment.

Speaking out: Dianne Feinstein, the sponsor of the assault weapons ban, announced the decision to drop that portion of the bill

Gun rights issue: The assault weapons ban was the most controversial of the major proposals to restrict guns that have been advanced by President Obama and Senate Democrats

She is all but certain to need 60 votes from the 100-member Senate to prevail, but faces solid Republican opposition and likely defections from some moderate Democrats.

'I very much regret it,' Feinstein, a Democrat from California, told reporters of Reid's decision. 'I tried my best.'

Killer: Adam Lanza used an assault rifle when he murdered 20 children and six adults at Sandy Hook Elementary School on December 14

Asked about the decision, Reid said he 
wanted to bring a gun bill to the full Senate that would have enough 
support to overcome any GOP attempts to prevent debate from even 
starting.

He said that 'using the most optimistic numbers,' there were less than 40 votes for Feinstein's ban.

That is far less than the 60 votes 
needed to begin considering legislation, and an indication that Reid 
feared that including the assault weapons ban in the main guns bill 
would risk getting the votes needed to begin debate.

'I'm not going to try to put something on the floor that won't succeed. I want something that will succeed.

'I think the worst of all worlds would be to bring to something to the floor and it dies there,' Reid said.

Feinstein, an author of the 1994 assault weapons ban that expired after a decade, said that fellow Democrat Reid, informed her of the decision yesterday.

There are 53 Democrats in the Senate, plus two independents who usually vote with them.

An assault-type weapon was used by Adam Lanza in the December massacre at Sandy Hook Elementary School in Newtown, Connecticut, that revived gun control as a top issue in Washington.

It was also used in the 'Dark Knight' shooting spree in Aurora, Colorado, and the deadly Christmas Eve shooting of firefighters responding to a blaze in upstate New York.

Pledge: Banning assault weapons was among the proposals Obama made in January in response to the Sandy Hook killings

Procedure: Senate Majority Leader Harry Reid said the gun control bill will face two votes after it goes up for debate next month

Banning those firearms was among the proposals President Obama made in January in response to those slayings.

The assault weapons ban was the most 
controversial of the major proposals to restrict guns that have been 
advanced by Obama and Senate Democrats. 

Applications for gun permits have jumped in Newtown, Connecticut, since a school massacre there revived the national debate on gun control and led to worries about new restrictions.

Newtown in recent years has issued about 130 gun permits annually.

Police say the town received 79 permit applications in the three months since the December 14 massacre, more than double the normal pace.

Robert Berkins, records manager for Newtown police, says many applicants have expressed concerns that their gun rights will be taken away.

Firearms sales have surged around the country, driven by Washington's new focus on gun control.

20 first-graders and six adults were killed at Sandy Hook Elementary School when Adam Lanza forced his way in and began opening fire in the hallway and in two classrooms.

Because
 of that, it had been expected that the assault weapons measure would be
 left out of the initial package the Senate considers, with Democrats 
hoping the Senate could therefore amass the strongest possible vote for 
the overall legislation.

Having
 a separate vote on assault weapons might free moderate Democratic 
senators facing re-election next year in Republican-leaning states to 
vote against the assault weapons measure, but then support the remaining
 overall package of gun curbs.

Gun control supporters consider a 
strong Senate vote important because the Republican-run House has shown 
little enthusiasm for most of Obama's proposals.

Feinstein said Reid told her there will be two votes.

One would be on her assault weapons ban, which also includes a ban on ammunition magazines that carry more than 10 rounds of ammunition.

The second would just be on prohibiting the high-capacity magazine clips.

Many Democrats think the ban on large-capacity magazines has a better chance of getting 60 votes than the assault weapons ban.

The Senate Judiciary Committee has approved four gun control measures this month, including Feinstein's barring assault weapons and high-capacity magazines. 

The others would expand required federal background checks for firearms buyers, increase federal penalties for illegal gun trafficking and boost school safety money.
