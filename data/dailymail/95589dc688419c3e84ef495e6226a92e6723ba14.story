Tony Pulis refuted suggestions that Saido Berahino is unhappy at West Brom after the forward refused to celebrate any of his four goals in the 7-0 demolition of Gateshead in the FA Cup.

The England forward has been repeatedly linked with a move away from The Hawthorns in the January transfer window and speculation only increased on Friday when technical director Terry Burton admitted that the club had halted contract negotiations with Berahino.

On Saturday, Berahino was in terrific form, producing several clinical finishes but his glum reaction to scoring the goals captured the attention.

His new manager said: ‘Someone said he didn’t celebrate at all. It was lovely to see all the lads go over when we scored a goal as that showed the unity that we’ll need. You should see him in the dressing room, he’s happy in there.’

Pulis insists that despite reported interest from Liverpool and Tottenham, West Brom are still to receive an offer for the striker: ‘I hope he keeps reading the headlines if he scores four every week. There is always going to be transfer speculation and you can see why.

‘He has great pace, great balance and scores goals. But when I came in here the chairman had not received any offer for him and we will try our damnedest to try and improve him.’

Pulis, for his part, can reflect on a successful first match in charge. Victor Anichebe, Chris Brunt and James Morrison added to Berahino’s four to add some gloss to the scoreline but West Brom made a dire start to the match and took 42 minutes to break through.

Pulis admits that he felt compelled to swap the director’s box for the dugout on the quarter-hour mark after his side made a sluggish start to the match.

He said: ‘I had no intentions of going down. It took me only 15 minutes! We started very apprehensive and they shouldn’t be like that but they were against West Ham too, especially in the final third. They have to eradicate that and play with confidence and belief.’
