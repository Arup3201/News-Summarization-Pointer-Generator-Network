An information reward in exchange for tips in the murder of a 19-year-old who was burned alive has been boosted to $43,000 - as no prime suspect has been named. 

The FBI contributed $25,000 to the previous $18,000 figure, Panola County District Attorney John Champion told The Clarion Ledger.

Mississippi teenager Jessica Chambers was burned alive on December 6, with 98 percent of the teenager's body covered in burns and her car also set on fire, the newspaper reported. 

Chambers died the next day.

Victim: 19-year-old Jessica Chambers (seen left and right) was able to get out of her burning car on December 6, though 98 percent of her body was covered in burns

Fire: Flammable liquid had been poured on Jessica Chambers head of her murder

Authorities have spoken to over 100 people but there is no prime suspect in the teenager's murder, according to The Clarion Ledger.

Chambers is believed to have told first responders the assailant's name, 'but even leads connected to that statement have not yet panned out,' the newspaper reported.

'We're still interviewing people,' Champion told the newspaper. 'Mostly we're in the process of re-interviewing people and going through everything with a fine-tooth comb.'

He also said 'A lot of things in this world are money-driven, and we're hoping that there's someone out there that know something that sees the reward and is willing to come forward.'  

Both state and federal law enforcement agencies are working together on the case, according to the newspaper, which reported that gangs have been suggested as being tied to the murder. 

The teenager's father Ben Chambers told The Clarion Ledger, however, that a purported gang member reached out to him to offer sympathies.

'They're very upset about it,' Chambers said. 'They said you wouldn't even treat a dog like that.'

Chambers also said 'We're just waiting and hoping that something will hurry up and happen, and praying and getting through it. If something doesn't happen we might go crazy.' 

Investigation: Authorities have spoken to over 100 people but there is no suspect in the teenager's murder

Mystery: Before she died, Jessica Chambers went to a gas station and in surveillance video a person off-camera gestured toward her.  She is seen here

Champion relayed difficulties with the investigation to The Associated Press last month. 

'There's just not a lot of street talk out there about who may or may not have done'  but 'we feel like somebody out there has heard something,' he said.  

Panola County Sheriff Dennis Darby previously told Fox News that flammable liquid had been poured on Jessica Chambers ahead of her murder.

Before she died, Chambers went to a gas station and in surveillance video a person off-camera called her away, the website reported.

Gas station owner Ali Alsanai told Fox News that he was at the store on December 6 - and that he and Chambers had 'Just small talk. I wasn’t really paying attention because I was busy that day.'

Alsanai has been ruled out, Champion told the news outlet.
