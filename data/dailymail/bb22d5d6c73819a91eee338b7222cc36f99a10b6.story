Norway's CycloCable bike escalator is revolutionising urban transport. 

While pedal power is an inexpensive - not to mention healthy - way to get around a big city,  hills can often be the bane of cyclist's existence.

A steep ascent is no problem however for the  residents of Trondheim, in Norway's north east, thanks to Jarle Wanvik, the inventor of the Trampe.

Norway's CycloCable bike escalator is revolutionising urban cycling in the city of Trondheim

Developed to help cyclists tackle the city's steep inclines, the CycloCable is like a ski lift for bikes

The bike escalator, or Trampe lift, as it was known, was built in 1993 by Wanvik, a commuter who grew tired of showing up to work sweaty and exhausted.

In 2013, the lift was upgraded and rebranded as the CycloCable - and it has quickly become a tourist magnet.

So far, it's already ferried 200,000 cyclists up the hill at Brubakken near Gamle Bybro, from the bridge almost all the way up to the Kristiansten Fort.

It was first built in 1993 - then called the Trampe lift - by Jarle Wanvik

In 2013, the lift was upgraded and renamed the CycloCable - quickly becoming a tourist magnet

The 420 feet-long device climbs at a gradient of between 10 and 18 per cent, and all the user has to do is put their foot on one of its 11 foot plates attached to a wire rope.

An accelerated starting point gets users moving but after the initial first burst it's a simple case of keeping one foot on the plate and the other off the ground to cruise up the hill at 5mph. 

It's quite simple to use, with no reported injuries since it's opened.

When standing beside the CycloCable, the cyclist puts their left foot on the left pedal of their bike and their right foot in the starting slot of the base station.

At 420 feet long, the wire rope with 11 foot plates attached, climbs at an incline between 10 and 18 per cent

The CycloCable can also ferry baby strollers (left) and scooters (right) up the Brubakken hill

Up to five individuals can use the lift at any given time, using their bike or scooter as a form of support

Stretching your right leg backwards, keep the right foot on the start slot to receive the push of the soft-start mechanism. 

The lift then carries the cyclist the remainder of the distance, with the bicycle acting as merely a means of support.  

Up to five people can use it at the same time and it's actually not limited strictly to bicycles - strollers and scooters are also acceptable.
