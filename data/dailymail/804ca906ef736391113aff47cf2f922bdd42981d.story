A shocking new video illustrates how race and color continue to play a major role in how someone is perceived in American society.

The video, shot in Los Angeles, compares the general public’s reaction to first a white male, then a black male, attempting to break into a car.

The social experiment was the idea of Jason Roberts, who hosts the YouTube channel Simple Misfits.

He recently took to the streets of L.A. along with his friend Quentin Brunson and filmed the predictable - yet depressing - results.

First Roberts, who is white, attempts to break into the car with a wire hanger. Despite the car’s alarm blaring, no one pays him any attention and at one point the police even drive past without stopping to confront him.

After 30 minutes, Roberts gives up and then we see the radically different reaction when Brunson, who is black, takes up the challenge.

Instantly passers-by are suspicious and a group of men standing nearby start to take pictures on a phone.

Within two minutes, the LAPD arrive – possibly alerted by the passers-by – and Brunson is instantly greeted with a harsh attitude and an order to put his hands up.

‘Let me see your f**king hands,’ orders one cop. ‘Get up against the wall.’

Brunson is quickly surrounded by at least five officers and placed in handcuffs.

That’s where the shocking video ends, although in reality Roberts quickly stepped in and explained to the police what was happening.

Critics might complain that the video is staged, but Roberts says it was inspired by being involved in  similar double standards situation in real-life.

He had locked himself out of his car and called the AAA to help him get back into it.

The mechanic who arrived was black and Roberts was immediately aware that when he started working the car door, strangers started staring while they had simply ignored his own attempts.

According to Roberts, the goal of the video is to raise awareness of how people are treated differently depending on their color.

In fact, FBI statistics show that 64 percent of motor vehicle theft was carried out by whites in 2011, while black perpetrators were responsible for 33.9 percent.

The video was posted online just days after Michael Dunn, a white man who fired on a group of black teenagers in Florida, killing one, was convicted on three attempted murder counts but escaped his most serious charge of first-degree murder.

Dunn's verdict has revived conversations about how white and black Americans face markedly different levels of suspicion and hostility in many situations.

Within two minutes of Brunson approached the car, the LAPD has arrived and he is ordered to step away from the vehicle
