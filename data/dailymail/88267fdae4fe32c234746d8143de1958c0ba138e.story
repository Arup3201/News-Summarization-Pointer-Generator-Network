David Moyes admits that he has felt ‘ashamed’ over Manchester United’s slump at times this season but believes his team are still capable of producing another big performance to topple European champions Bayern Munich.

United were paired with the German giants in the draw for the Champions League quarter-finals yesterday after wiping out a two-goal deficit to beat Olympiacos at Old Trafford in midweek.

It was one of the few highlights of Moyes’s troubled reign and the United boss confessed that, after suffering six home defeats this season, it was a relief to be able to look supporters in the eye as he made the walk from his dug-out to the tunnel.

‘I thought it was great that I could applaud the supporters on Wednesday night,’ he said.

‘In some of the other games I’ve felt ashamed because the team haven’t played well enough.

‘The big thing was that I could look the supporters in the face after the game because I thought that we had given them something to shout about and had nothing to be ashamed of in our performance.’

Bayern have knocked United out of Europe twice since Sir Alex Ferguson’s side famously beat them with two late goals to win the Champions League in 1999, and will be firm favourites when they meet again next month.

Moyes, an avid observer of  German football who was linked with the managerial posts at Schalke and Wolfsburg during his time at Everton, is well aware of what his opponents can do.

His scouting missions to Bavaria to watch potential transfer targets Toni Kroos, Dante and Mario Mandzukic have given the United boss a valuable insight into Pep Guardiola’s side, and he believes there are some weaknesses that can be exploited.

'I’ve got a few things that I’ve seen
 that I would try to work on and capitalise on,’ added Moyes.

‘They are 
the holders but I don’t think the holders have ever won the Champions 
League so hopefully we can try and do something about that.

‘When
 we were 2-0 down to Olympiacos I don’t think there were too many people
 putting us through so in a lot of ways it didn’t matter who I drew but 
I’ve probably got the favourites.

Ones to beat: Munich are the current holders of the Champions League

‘They proved that they’re the best team in the world by winning the Club World Cup but I’m actually looking forward to it.

‘There
 have been some epic games between the two clubs over the years and if I
 can get another epic game then that will mean we have come close. That 
has to be the idea.’

It
 was perhaps typical of Moyes’s time at Old Trafford that no sooner had 
he spoken about his excitement at facing Bayern than Robin van Persie — 
whose hat-trick against Olympiacos made it all  possible — was 
effectively ruled out of both legs with a knee injury.

Blow: United will have to do without the services of Van Persie for the Munich clash as the Dutch striker has been ruled out for six weeks with a leg injury

United
 are already without Patrice Evra for the first game through  
suspension, meaning that Moyes may have to rely on Alex Buttner at left 
back, and he could offer no assurances that injured central defenders 
Jonny Evans and Chris Smalling will be fit in time.

At least the embattled United boss could enjoy a little respite on Friday.

While
 victory over the Greeks lifted some of the pressure building around 
him, the quarter-final draw completely overshadowed Saturday’s difficult
 trip to West Ham.

The challenge, he acknowledges, is to produce performances like Wednesday night on a consistent basis.

Change in fortunes? Moyes has called on his United side to reproduce the performance against Olympiacos for the remainder of the season

‘I
 came to the club to have those nights,’ said Moyes. ‘I joined Manchester United because I knew they would happen more often than not.

'We’ve
 had some big highs, mainly in the Champions League, but some big lows 
in the Premier League and that is the bit we will look to improve on.

‘It has been a difficult initiation period but I still believe that my time here will have more good times than bad times. We will not always be right at the top but we have to be closer than where we are now.’
