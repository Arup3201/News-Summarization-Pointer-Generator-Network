Mehdi Abeid believes in-form Newcastle striker Ayoze Perez can be one of the buys of the season.

The midfielder thinks his team-mate can take the Barclays Premier League by storm now he has settled at the Magpies.

Perez has three goals in his last three games after his stunning strike in their 2-0 win at West Brom on Sunday.

Ayoze Perez scored a stunning goal against West Brom as Newcastle won their fifth game in a row

He flicked Daryl Janmaat's cross in with his heel from 12 yards to inspire Newcastle to a fifth straight win in all competitions.

The Magpies bought the Spaniard for a reported fee of around £1.5million from Tenerife in the summer and Abeid insisted Perez is a bargain.

He said: 'If he continues like this he can be a big player for us.

'He needs to score, he is very technical - a very good player - and we know he can do big things for us.

'We always knew he is a very, very good player, we are really happy for him and I hope he will score a lot more for us.

'The goal was really technical and we can see in training he has some great skills and he showed it on Sunday.'

The Magpies have risen to eighth in the Barclays Premier League table after four successive wins, along with beating Manchester City in the League Cup.

Newcastle have suddenly found their form to boost previously under-fire manager Alan Pardew

It has lifted the pressure off manager Alan Pardew and Algeria Under 23 international Abeid insisted they always believed their season would turn, despite failing to win any of their opening seven league games.

'We've always been working to have some success,' said the 22-year-old. 'We have to keep showing we're a good team and we can do our best every game. Sunday was a great win for the team.

'Now it's a good time to have some fresh air, to play with the national teams and we will come back better and fresh for the next couple of games.'

Abeid made only his second league start for Newcastle at The Hawthorns and has broken into the first team after spending last season on loan at Panathinaikos.

'A lot has changed, I've been out on loan a lot and I have come back here to have some time to play and show the manager and the club I can play for them. I am really happy,' said Abeid, who also went on loan to St Johnstone in 2013.

'I knew I had to play football and that's what I went and did, to play football and enjoy my time. I got a lot of experience, I learned a lot and I came back with a strong mentality and a strong character.'

Mehdi Abeid always believed Newcastle would turn their fortunes around this season
