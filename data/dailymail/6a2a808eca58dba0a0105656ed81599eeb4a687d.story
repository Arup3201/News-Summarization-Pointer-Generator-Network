Most people use their will to leave money to family and friends, charities or the church.

But one mystery woman decided to donate more than half a million pounds to whoever was in power.

Joan LB Edwards bequeathed a sum of £520,000 to the government at the time of her death, but with the Tories and Lib Dems in coalition the two parties had to share the cash.

Cashing in: David Cameron and Nick Clegg split the money left to the government of the day

The mysterious donation emerged as the Electoral Commission published the latest donations figures for April to June this year.

The huge sum left by Ms Edwards meant she was the second biggest donor to any party, behind Unite which continues to bankroll the Labour party.

The Liberal Democrats said the she had left the bequest to 'the party in government of the day'.

With two parties sharing power, the money was split according to their number of MPs and ministers.

As the larger party, the Conservatives received £420,576 while the Lib Dems had £99,423.

A Conservative spokesman said: 'We don't comment on the details of specific donations. It was out of the blue. We weren't expecting it.'

It is unusual for the money to be left to the governing party of the day, regardless of who is in power.

Last year it emerged dead Britons had left the Treasury £54,000 to help pay off the ballooning national debt from beyond the grave.

In 2010-11 members of the public gave more than £1million to the government as a gift to the nation, almost all left in wills.

And £54,634.36 was specifically set aside ‘for the reduction of the national debt’.

Amid growing doubts about why Ms Edwards' money was taken by the political parties and not added to Treasury coffers to spend on public services, it emerged the decision was taken by the solicitors acting as executors of her will.

They consulted the Treasury solicitors and the Attorney General’s office before making the decision to treat the money as a donation to the parties, both of which were 'surprised' by the money.

The decision of how to split the donation parties was made by the executors of the will.

A Lib Dem spokesman said: 'The Liberal Democrats were notified that the party was a beneficiary of Ms Edwards’ will.

'The party was also informed that the executors had made the decision to split the estate between the two political parties in Government.'

The Conservatives received a total of £4,116,006 during the three month period, including major donations from businessmen.

The
largest gifts to the Conservatives were £280,770 from co-treasurer and 
hedge fund boss Michael Farmer and £263,600 from investment banker James
Lupton.

Labour said the 
Tories received £1,042,970.93 in the last quarter from donors who 
attended private dinners with Mr Cameron and other senior ministers. It 
included £694,370 from donors in the financial sector.

Sadiq
Khan MP, Labour’s Shadow Justice Secretary, said: 'The Tories have 
raked in over £1 million from private dinners with David Cameron and 
senior Ministers in the last quarter.

'And more than two thirds of that comes from the City – the bankers and hedge fund bosses whose taxes David Cameron cut.

'Hardworking
families are seeing their living standards squeezed, with prices rising
faster than wages. Meanwhile David Cameron shows how out of touch he 
is, standing up for the millionaires who fund his party.'

Meanwhile,
the new figures show the Ministry of Sound gave £65,000 to the Lib 
Dems, just weeks before the nightclub's boss James Palumbo received a 
peerage from Nick Clegg.

The
superclub firm made a donation of £50,000 to the central party on June 
6, and on June 30 a further £15,000 was given to the Bermondsey and Old 
Southwark local association of Lib Dem deputy leader Simon Hughes.

Meanwhile, unions have tightened their grip on Labour and are now responsible for three-quarters of all big donations to party coffers.

The Unite union, which went to war with Ed Miliband over plans to curb union influence, gave £722,195 from April to June this year.

The figures also reveal that even the Lib Dems have raised more from individual non-union donors than the Labour party since the election.

The revelations will heap further pressure on Mr Miliband, who has faced growing criticism for his failure to set the political agenda in recent weeks.

The Labour leader is caught between trying to widen the appeal of his party while relying increasingly on trade unions to bankroll his campaign for Number 10.

The Electoral Commission today released details of all donations to political parties over £7,500.

In the three months to the end of June, 
Labour received a total of £3,136,447 in such donations, of which 72 per cent
came from five of the biggest unions.

Unite gave £772,195, the GMB £485,830, UNISON £458,080, USDAW £411,147 and the Communication Workers’ Union £143,121.

Labour stressed that the figures did not include smaller donations, and said union money accounted for 25 per cent of total donations since the start of the year.

Over the period Labour reduced its overdraft facilities by £2.5 million and took out two new loans of £1.22 million each with the Co-operative Bank and Unity Trust Bank.

The party had outstanding loans of £12.79 million at the end of June.

By contrast, the Tories are recorded as having £2.6 million of loans but have access to overdraft facilities of up to £10.13 million.

In the money: David Cameron's Conservatives received most in donations overall, while Nick Clegg's Lib Dems had more in donations from non-union sources than the Labour party, lead by Ed Miliband

Tory party chairman Grant Shapps said:
‘Despite Ed Miliband’s promise of change, these independent figures 
prove his Labour Party is still dominated by the trade unions.

‘They choose the candidates, pick the leader and remain Labour’s biggest donors - providing three quarters of the party's money.

‘Until Ed Miliband stops taking his union paymasters’ cash, he will be too weak to stand up for hardworking people.

‘Instead,
he can only offer what the union barons want in return for their money -
the same old Labour policy of more spending, more borrowing and more 
debt, exactly what got us into this mess in the first place.’

The UK Independence Party was buoyed by donations more than doubling to £160,000.

It included a single payment to its Tiverton and Honiton branch worth £50,000, the second highest payment to a local association of any party.

UKIP has grown hugely in the last year, picking up an extra 15,000 members.

Last month Unite general secretary Len
McCluskey aid out a £63billion shopping list of left-wing policies he 
says Labour must adopt or lose millions in funding.

He
said the Labour leader had to be ‘bold’ and reverse the coalition’s 
benefit reforms, halt spending cuts and borrowing billions to build 
1million extra homes.

Labour’s reliance on union backing means it now raises less from individuals than Nick Clegg’s Liberal Democrats.

In the latest three months, the Lib Dems raised £801,000 from non-union donations while Labour received only £730,000.

Since the 2010 general election the Lib Dems have raised £6million from individuals compared to £4million for Labour.

And Mr Miliband has struggled to widen the supporter base, with only 305 individual Labour donors, compared to 1,077 for the Lib Dems.

Even with the union barons bankrolling the party, Labour still received less than the Conservatives.
