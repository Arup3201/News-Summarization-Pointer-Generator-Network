The planned sale of 316 Royal Bank of Scotland branches to rival Santander collapsed last night in a ‘major blow’ to the state-backed lender.

Troubled RBS – 83 per cent owned by the taxpayer after a £45billion bailout – has been working on the deal for two years as it battles to recover from the banking crisis.

But Spanish buyer Santander has pulled the plug, blaming the poor quality of RBS’s IT systems, which crashed over the summer.

Setback: Stephen Hester hailed the deal to sell branches 'an important milestone'

The collapse of the £1.65billion deal 
is another setback for RBS chief executive Stephen Hester, who has been 
forced to sacrifice his bonus for the past two years.

The bank is also braced for a large 
penalty for its involvement in the Libor rate-rigging scandal that saw 
rival Barclays fined £290million.

When the deal to sell the 316 branches was agreed in 2010, Mr Hester hailed it as ‘an important milestone in our restructuring’.

The disposals were ordered by the European Commission in return for the UK government’s rescue of RBS in 2008.

Sources said the bank is confident a new deal can be reached before the EU deadline at the end of next year.

Other potential buyers include Sir 
Richard Branson’s Virgin Money – which took over Northern Rock – Tesco, 
NBNK and Co-operative Bank, which recently bought more than 600 branches
from Lloyds Banking Group.

It is thought RBS may even spin the branches off as a separate company and list them on the London Stock Exchange.

'Major blow': Spanish bank Santander pulled out on the deal to buy the branches, blaming RBS' poor quality IT systems

The collapse will throw into confusion the bank transfers of some 1.8million RBS customers.

However a source insisted it was ‘business as usual’.

Any customer already issued with a 
credit or debit card or account number under the Santander brand will be
able to carry on using them as an existing customer of RBS, the bank 
promised last night.

It said it is ‘determined that the decision will have no impact on the service available to customers’.

Mr Hester said: ‘I can assure all 
affected customers that there will be no disruption to the service they 
receive. It is business as usual in all of these branches, and customers
don’t need to take any action.’

He went on: ‘While this is a 
profitable part of our business that we would rather not part with, RBS 
has worked hard to ensure it is substantially separate from our UK 
branch network and corporate business and largely ready to be taken on 
by a new owner.

Much of the heavy lifting associated 
with a transfer has already been completed, including separating data 
for customers and putting in place a standalone management team.

‘It is of course disappointing that 
Santander decided to pull out of this transaction, especially for the 
customers and staff involved.

‘However, RBS’s strong progress in our
restructuring plans means we can continue to provide a stable home for 
this business and its customers pending a further resolution. RBS will 
commence a new process of disposal and will provide a further update in 
due course.’

The proposed deal, which involved the 
sale of 310 RBS branches in England and Wales and six  NatWest branches 
in Scotland, has been fraught with problems and delays.

The major sticking point has been the 
compatibility of the RBS accounts with Santander’s computer systems. The
bank has a poor record in moving other banks’ customer to its own IT 
system.

Two years ago it bodged the transfer 
of five million Alliance & Leicester customers acquired in a 
takeover in 2008, and some customers were locked out of their accounts 
for weeks.
