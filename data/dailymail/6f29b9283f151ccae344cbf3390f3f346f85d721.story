Stuart McCall  admitted on Tuesday night not even the club’s own fans will give them a prayer against Hibs on Sunday — but insisted he can rescue Rangers’ flagging play-off hopes.

A 2-2 draw with lowly part-timers Alloa Athletic at Ibrox in his second match in charge made it five draws on the spin for a Rangers side in complete freefall.

McCall now faces a difficult task lifting his players for a daunting trip to Easter Road to face Hibs, who have defeated the Ibrox men three times in the Championship this season with a 9-1 aggregate score.

But the Rangers boss insists he saw some positives on Tuesday night and that he is still relishing the chance of turning his side around as they bid to win promotion to the top flight.

‘That’s one win in nine now but if people think the season ends tonight, they’ve got an awakening ahead of them,’ said McCall.

‘On Sunday, the last time we were at Easter Road we got beat 4-0, and it’s 9-1 on aggregate overall this season. Even our own fans won’t give us a hope but football can change quickly.

‘We need to do it and it’s games like that I relish — and a lot of players in that dressing room, believe it or not, will relish it, too.

‘I’m relishing the challenge more than ever. I accept it’s not good enough against a side who were sitting second bottom of the table.

‘But I saw some performances I could take a lot from. There’s still a long way to go this season and there will be no defeatist attitude from anyone in my dressing room.’

On a night when Alloa unveiled shock new signing Michael Chopra, the former Sunderland and Newcastle striker, McCall ruled out fresh recruits to Ibrox.

‘At this time of the season, the new faces that you can get in are lads that have not done anything since January,’ he said.

‘We have got enough players in the squad that we are trying to get up to speed. There is a Under-20s game on Wednesday and I will get a look at some of the boys in that.

‘I thought (Andrew) Murdoch was terrific tonight, I thought (Tom) Walsh was terrific. And we had decent performances from a couple of others.

‘We weren’t rotten tonight. We were better than we were on Saturday. We’ve drawn twice with Alloa already this season and it was never going to be 3-0 or 4-0.

‘The players showed spirit and ability after coming from behind to go ahead but we’ve switched off and let them score with their second time up the park. It is easy to knock what is going on here. I respect that and understand that.

‘But there is a fight to be had and we have got to have enough fighters to believe we can go on and still make this season a success. But tonight is a massive disappointment. Ibrox has become a hard place to play and the players know they’ve got themselves in this position with their performances in recent months.’

Meanwhile, the SFA’s appeal against Steve Simonsen’s two-match ban for gambling on football matches has been postponed due to the unavailability of tribunal members. The appeal was due to be held today but a new date will now be set.
