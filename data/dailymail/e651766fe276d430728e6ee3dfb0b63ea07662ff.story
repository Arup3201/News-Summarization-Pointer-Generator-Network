An Indian pilot is being probed after pictures turned up on social media sites showing him using his cockpit to allow pals to get 'selfie' images.

The scandal, which breaches all guidelines for pilots was exposed after pilot Sahil Arora, 34, uploaded the pictures on his Facebook page.

In one of the photographs, Arora can be seen posing with crew members for a selfie, in another he is seen with a female friend as an elderly gentleman occupies the pilot's seat.

Not content with just getting a music star to pose, Mr Arora then snapped himself with actor Shah Rukh Khan

He has defended himself against allegations that he breached guidelines, by saying that most of the photos were shot before the plane had taken off. 

But according to insiders the pilot's foolish move in uploading the pictures onto social media sites actually only exposed what was effectively the tip of the iceberg, and they said that many pilots were doing the same irresponsible behaviour and risking the lives of their passengers. 

The pilot, who is temporarily grounded, works for Jet Airways, a major Indian airline based in the western city of Mumbai.

A spokesman for the DGCA has described the leaked photographs as a 'very serious issue'

Guidelines issued by the Director General of Civil Aviation's (DGCA) state clearly that only a certain number of specified people are allowed inside the cockpit. That means either the pilot, a DGCA inspecting official, an engineer of the airline or trainee pilot and nobody else.

But the selfie-obsessed pilot's images show him not only with pals but also with Indian celebrities such as the rapper Honey Singh and actor Shah Rukh Khan.

A spokesman for the DGCA said: 'It is a very serious issue. He clearly compromised security guidelines. This is totally irresponsible behaviour by a qualified and highly trained pilot, who permitted unauthorised persons to have a bizarre photo shoot inside the cockpit.

It seems Mr Arora enjoys his picture being taken, especially when there's aircraft involved

Mr Arora is a keen fan of the selfie - but he took it one step further aboard a Jet Airways plane

Many would see this as somewhat of a show-off pic - but his latest offerings have flouted all the rules

'We will serve a show cause notice to Jet Airways and if it is found that there has been a violation of security rules, DGCA may cancel the pilot's licence.

'Recently, the DGCA suspended the flying licence of four pilots who allowed their family members inside the cockpit mid-air. The pilot of a third flight, who allowed passengers inside the cockpit of a plane on the verge of take-off, was taken off flying duties.

MailOnline Travel has contacted Jet Airways, and is awaiting comment.
