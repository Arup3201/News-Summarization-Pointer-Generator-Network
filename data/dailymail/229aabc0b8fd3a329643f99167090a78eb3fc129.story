A lawyer for Rupert Murdoch's News Group Newspapers (NGN) said the company could face 500 lawsuits from victims of tabloid phone hacking - far more than have so far been filed.

Michael Silverleaf told a court hearing today that 'we are dealing with 500 claims, potentially' from people who say their voicemail messages were intercepted by the now-defunct News of the World.

NGN has paid millions to settle lawsuits from 60 actors, athletes, politicians and other public figures whose voicemails were hacked by the tabloid.

These include actor Steve Coogan, Lib Dem MP Simon Hughes, footballer Paul Gascoigne and singer Pete Doherty.

More than 45 new cases are due to go 
to court, with claimants including Manchester United star Wayne Rooney, 
Stoke City and England footballer Peter Crouch, ex-boxer Chris Eubank, 
barrister Cherie Blair - wife of former Labour prime minister Tony Blair
- and also actor James Nesbitt and singer James Blunt.

The News of the World has admitted it 
hacked phones to listen in to voicemail messages and ‘blagged’ personal 
details through impersonation.

In February, Mr Coogan and Liberal Democrat MP 
Simon Hughes were both in court to hear that they would receive £40,000 
and £45,000 respectively plus their legal fees.

The court heard that Mr 
Coogan was placed under surveillance in May 2002 while staying at a 
London hotel and that private detective Glenn Mulcaire posed as him to 
get confidential information from Vodafone between 2003 and 2006.

Former Labour spin doctor Alastair 
Campbell, who was described as a ‘writer, communicator and strategist’, 
received undisclosed ‘substantial damages’ and was the only one who has 
announced he would be donating the money to charity.

Phone-hacking by the newspaper also 
caused former England football star Paul Gascoigne ‘mental harm and 
distress’, the court heard.

He was so convinced that the information 
published about him had come from his closest friends that he suffered a
breakdown.

The newspaper agreed to pay him £68,000 plus costs and 
apologised for the ‘seriously detrimental effect’.

But it wasn’t just celebrities who were caught up in the disgraced tabloid’s actions.

Rival journalists and their families, 
people who were merely friends with celebrities, relatives of victims of
the 7/7 London bombings and even a dancer who shared the same surname 
as Wayne Rooney were also targeted.

Many other damages claims have already been settled.

Murdoch closed the News of the World last July amid an outcry over its wrongdoing.

James Murdoch,39, quit as executive 
chairman of News International at the end of February in a bid to 
distance himself from the increasingly toxic phone-hacking scandal 
engulfing his father's empire.

Lawyers involved in legal action 
following allegations that tabloid journalists hacked celebrities’ 
phones will pocket up to £600 an hour, a court heard today.

Details
of fees being paid to lawyers representing people who claim that phones
were hacked - and lawyers representing newspaper owners - emerged at a 
High Court hearing in London.

A
High Court judge set limits on what barristers and solicitors involved 
could earn in an attempt to stop legal costs getting 'out of hand'.

Tracey Temple, who had a relationship with Lord Prescott, and MP George Galloway also agreed payouts

Rocker Pete Doherty and former 
Labour spin doctor Alistair Campbell both received payouts from the 
newspaper company

Mr Justice Vos set rates for leading barristers at up to £600 an hour and said most junior barristers could earn no more than £330 an hour. He said solicitors could earn between £140 and £400 an hour.

The judge said he had set 'relatively low rates'.

'I’m afraid they are not low in comparison to what most people make,' Mr Justice Vos told the hearing.

'But they are low in terms of what lawyers sometimes charge.'

At a pre-trial hearing, the lawyers discussed budgets.

'The objective (is to) limit costs of this litigation, which obviously are going to be very expensive because of the number of individual claimants,' said Mr Justice Vos.

'This really is a wholly exceptional piece of litigation.'

He said he wanted to ensure that legal costs were 'proportionate', did not 'get out of hand' and were not 'disproportionate to the amount at stake'.

The judge added: 'That is why I have set relatively low rates.'

iPhones were used 'during the relevant period'

Mr Justice Vos was told today how evidence had emerged about use of iPhones by 'senior executives' at News International.

Lawyers representing claimants said evidence suggested that the company iPhones were used 'during the relevant period'.

They asked for iPhones and related email accounts to be preserved.

The judge said who used the iPhones and what they were used for would be 'open for discussion'.

Lawyers would give no more detail about iPhone evidence outside court after the hearing.

Private investigator Glenn Mulcaire 
and former News of the World royal editor Clive Goodman were given jail 
terms in 2007 after the Old Bailey heard they plotted to hack into royal
aides’ telephone messages.

New police inquiries into phone hacking have started since then.

Appeal court judge Lord Justice Leveson is chairing an inquiry into press ethics in the wake of revelations about hacking.
