She should be swinging around a vast green expanse with her family, but instead Masha is being forced to wiggle along holding an umbrella and basket of flowers.

But a life in captivity means she is used to it and today the 11-year-old brown bear is taking part in a circus dress rehearsal.

Masha is one of  four bears who have completed a three 
year training programme in Russia as part of a travelling troupe.

All dressed up: Masha, an 11-year-old bear from a travelling circus troupe based in Moscow, walks in costume during rehearsals in the Circus on Fontanka in St. Petersburg

Head for heights: Masha practices a tightrope walking act. All the bears will perform this month for the first time in 20 years in the Circus on Fontanka in St. Petersburg

Grooming: Mikhail, a trainer from a travelling circus troupe based in Moscow, grooms Masha, an 11 year-old bear

All the bears will perform this month for the first time in 20 
years in the Circus on Fontanka in St. Petersburg.

Masha is accompanied by Julia, a six-year-old bear, who balances her way across a tightrope to the amusement of crowds and three-year-old Dasha.

The travelling circus group are usually based in Moscow and tickets to the show, which runs for two weeks, cost £30 per person.

The show runs for two hours and was founded by People's Artist of Russia Mikhail Ivanov and continued by his son Alexander Ivanov.

In the weeks leading up to the show Mr Ivanov has been seen dragging muzzled Dasha around the city on a chain to encourage ticket sales. 

Keeping still: Julia, a 6-year-old bear, and Vladimir Shzigorev, of a travelling circus troupe balance their way across the tightrope

Entertainment: Masha is accompanied by Julia, a six-year-old bear, who balances her way across a tightrope to the amusement of crowds and three-year-old Dasha

The show programme promises the audience will see 'Bears and actors compete for balancing 
on a rope at big height, you will see natural talent and unique 
possibilities of brown bears.'

Many Russian circuses train bears to skate and even play ice hockey.

In
2009 an ice-skating brown bear killed a circus trainer and seriously 
injured another man after mauling them during rehearsals.

Seven
years previously, a bear on loan from Russia to the Bishkek city zoo 
attacked and killed a small child who reached out to pet it.

Experts blamed its behaviour on severe malnourishment.

Animal rights campaigns PETA reacted 
angrily to the photos, and told the MailOnline that animal performance 
shows were 'outdated.'

'There’s
nothing funny about tearing bears away from their protective mothers 
shortly after birth and forcing them to perform silly tricks. These 
magnificent animals suffer from debilitating loneliness and depression 
when isolated from other bears.

'Many
retaliate and are known to attack people and attempt to escape at any 
given chance. Many bear cubs taken from the wild die before the training
begins because of the stress of capture, the gruelling transportation 
conditions, starvation, dehydration and rough handling.

'The
ones who survive have the tops of their muzzles pierced with hot 
needles and a rope threaded through the holes – they are then forced to 
stand on their hind legs and perform under threat of punishment. These 
and other animal acts are outdated and have no place in any civilised 
society.'
