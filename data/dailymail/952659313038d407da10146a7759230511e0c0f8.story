According to the children's rhyme, beans are the musical fruit - but now you can turn any food and household item into an instrument thanks to Ototo.

Ototo, from London-based designers Dentaku, is a small synthesiser that lets people build instruments out of everyday, inanimate objects including pipes, cardboard boxes and other junk items.

Alternatively, users can connect it to fruit, vegetables and other conductive items to turn these objects into keys that play music when touched.

To turn an object into an instrument, users connect the Ototo, pictured right, from London-based Denatku, to the item using crocodile clips. A demonstration video shows the designers getting sounds from an aubergine, pictured left

Keys: 12 key capacitive touch keyboard (1 octave) with connectors

Sensors: Four sensor inputs, 5V analog input

Audio: Built-in speaker and 3.5mm headphone output

Power: Powered by 2 x AA batteries or micro USB

Memory: 128 Mbit Flash

Extras: Seven sensors including Rotation, Slider, Touch Strip, Light, Breath, Joystick and Force

Each Ototo has 12 touch inputs, similar to those found on a keyboard, as well as a built-in speaker and headphone port.

It can be powered by battery, or by USB.

There are four sensors that let users modify the sounds produced when the keys are pressed.

To turn an object into an instrument, users can plug crocodile clips to the object – the demonstration video uses an aubergine – and on the Ototo.

With conductive items, pressing the object produces the sound.

'Using different combinations of objects and sounds, the only limit is your imagination,’ said the inventors.

As well as standard items, any conductive object, including fruit and vegetables can be fitted to the Ototo to create an edible keyboard, like the one pictured

Dentaku has also created seven different sensors that can be fitted to the board to create different sounds.

These include the Rotation sensor, a potentiometer which can be turned to change the sound, and a light dependent resistor which changes the sound according to the amount of light it receives.

The Slider and Touch Strip sensors let users 
slide their finger across them to change the sound, while the Force sensor 
changes sound depending on the amount of pressure applied to it.

Dentaku has also created seven different sensors that can be fitted to the board to create different sounds. This includes sensors controlled by light, touch and force. The Breath sensor, pictured, changes the sound when someone blows into it, and could be used to make a saxophone-style instrument for example

And finally, the Joystick sensor looks like the analog stick on a gamepad and users can move it around to control two sounds at once.

Dentaku has set up a Kickstarter campaign to raise £50,000 for the development of Ototo.

The campaign ends on 2 March and the company has, so far, raised £13,500. If funded, the Ototo will go on sale in June for around £45
