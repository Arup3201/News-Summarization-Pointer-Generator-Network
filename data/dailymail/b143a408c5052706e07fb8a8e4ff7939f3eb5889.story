A former male Australian fashion model who had built a reputation on his androgynous looks has undergone sex reassignment surgery and is now a transgender woman.

Andreja – formerly Andrej – Pejic, 22, went public about her decision on Wednesday and revealed that going forward she will only be modeling women's fashion.

Pejic has been making waves in the modeling world due to her androgynous looks since being discovered as a teenager working at McDonald's.

Until now she had modeled both men's and women's collections in fashion shows and appeared on the cover of magazines such as Elle and New York.

‘I figured out who I was very early on - actually, at the age of 13, with the help of the internet - so I knew that a transition, becoming a woman, was always something I needed to do,’ the Serbian-born model told Style.com.

‘But it wasn’t possible at the time, and I put it off, and androgyny became a way of expressing my femininity without having to explain myself to people too much.’

Pejić was born in Bosnia in 1991 and fled along with her brother, mother and grandmother first to Serbia before emigrating to Australia in 2000 as political refugees.

In 2011, Pejic walked the runway during the Jean-Paul Gaultier women's show as part of the Paris Haute Couture Fashion Week Spring/Summer show

‘To all trans youth out there, I would like to say respect yourself and be proud of who you are. All human beings deserve equal treatment no matter their gender identity or sexuality.

'To be perceived as what you say you are is a basic human right,’ she said in a statement released via GLAAD.

With regards changing her name by adding an 'a' to the end, Pejic said, 'it’s not a full transformation  - it’s just an evolution.'

'Andrej is a Christian Orthodox name, and in that religion, it’s definitely a male name. So I kept the "j" and added an "a," which actually becomes a name that I don’t think exists. But I wanted to keep the "j" because that’s me. That’s my name.'

Pejic also posted a selfie on Facebook on Thursday with a message to her fans:  'As a transgender woman I hope to show that after transition (a life-saving process) one can be happy and successful in their new chapter.'

Pejic, who appeared in David Bowie's The Stars Are Out Tonight video last year, has received support from her agency, friends and family regarding her decision.
