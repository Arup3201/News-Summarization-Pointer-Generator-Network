Reading boss Steve Clarke and Bradford counterpart Phil Parkinson have both criticised the decision to play their FA Cup quarter-final replay on a Monday evening.

The FA have said they are powerless to move the game due to UEFA’s threat of heavy financial punishment.

The clubs must play again at the Madejski Stadium a week Monday, just 48 hours after they play league fixtures.

The tie cannot be staged in midweek as it would clash with Champions League games.

UEFA took away £1million of television revenue owed to English clubs and fined the FA £42,000 two years ago for scheduling games that clashed with European ties. FA sources admit their hands are tied, but Clarke and Parkinson believe the situation devalues the FA’s own competition.

‘My question to the FA is why,’ said Clarke. ‘I know that people says it’s UEFA but the FA have to be stronger. I just find it strange that they don’t protect their own showpiece competition.’

Parkinson secured Bradford’s place in the FA semi-final draw for the first time in 104 years following a fiercely fought goalless draw, and he said: ‘I think it’s a little bit disrespectful to the FA Cup and the magnitude of this game coming up.

‘It’s a history-making game. To have to play it so quickly is frustrating.’
