Ukip has been forced to axe one of its shortlisted candidates to stand in May's general election after he shared online a post which described mixed-race couples as 'a plague'. 

Mark Walker, 46, hoped to stand for the party in Bromsgrove, south of Birmingham. 

A second social media message claimed that the Israeli secret service organisation Mossad was responsible for the Charlie Hebdo massacre in Paris.

He told supporters he had been approached twice, and decided that he should allow his name to go forward

Walker, who was planning to contest Ukip's planned hustings tomorrow in Bromsgrove, had warned fellow party supporters about the dangers posed by social media, while still reposting bizarre conspiracy theories and messages decrying 'the plague of inter-racial marriage'.

Walker advised on his Ukip Facebook page, where he announced his plan to run for parliament, that people should 'share far and wide' an article called 'the genocide of the peoples of Europe'. 

In the disturbing article, the author claims a European elite wants to turn everyone into 'one homogeneous mixed breed of Blacks, Whites and Asians'. 

Walker posted a 'piece of advice to consider' for all Ukip supporters. He warned about the dangers of being added to groups by 'facebook friends'. 

He warned: 'Remember your name, profile and image will be associated with that Group and everything written there, and you may be surprised how different the views and opinions of that Group are with yours even though they may show a Ukip banner.' 

Labour MP John Healey told The Mirror: 'These are yet more disgusting views from Ukip representatives. I hope Mr Farage is going to immediately distance himself from this.' 

A spokesperson for the political party said: 'Ukip is non-racist, non-sectarian. Mark Walker will not be selected as we believe his comments show he is unsuitable.' 

This controversy follows comments by one senior Ukip official who claimed 'hundreds of thousands of bigots in the UK need representation too'. 

Walker warned his supporters of the dangers posed by social media especially when joining groups

Despite his advice on the dangers of social media, he posted a link to this disturbing race-hate website
