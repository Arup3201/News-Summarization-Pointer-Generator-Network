England won their World Cup dress rehearsal against Wales by getting their RBS 6 Nations off to a perfect start with a 21-16 victory at the Millennium Stadium.

Wales took a 10-0 lead inside eight minutes, with Rhys Webb scoring the game's first try, and led 16-8 at the interval.

But Bath pair Anthony Watson and Jonathan Joseph both grabbed tries as England shut out Wales in the second half and won for the first time in Cardiff after trailing at the break.

Wales

Leigh Halfpenny – 7

A world-class performer who settled Welsh nerves with superb early penalty and was solid throughout.

Alex Cuthbert (yellow card 61) – 5

Tackled well and a couple of good early carries. Second half yellow card blotted copy book.

Jonathan Davies – 7

Decent carrying game and rock solid defence from one of the world’s very best centres.

Jamie Roberts – 7

Man marked by England but still made some telling dents. Impressive contribution from top player.

George North – 7

Serious question will be asked about why he was allowed to play on after appearing to be knocked out twice.

Dan Biggar – 7

Another player to suffer a nasty head injury but shrugged it off to make an extremely assured contribution.

England fly-half George Ford scored two penalty kicks to seal the victory in Six Nations

Rhys Webb (Phillips 69) – 8

Fantastic first try appeared to set Wales on their way. Showed why he is now first-choice No9 ahead of Mike Phillips.

Gethin Jenkins (James 59) – 5

Struggled in the tight for second year running and came as no surprise when he was substituted.

Richard Hibbard – 6

Some powerful carries and determined tackling but not enough of a contribution in loose.

Samson Lee – 6

Another who struggled in the scrum but recovered from early setback to make a strong contribution.

Jake Ball – 6

Welsh line out functioned reasonably well and Ball was also prominent in the loose. A fine player.

Alun Wyn Jones – 7

The dominant lock in British rugby had his hands full with Dave Attwood. Went toe-to-toe and held his own.

Dan Lydiate – 5

Typically tenacious tackling display from the committed blindside forward. No impact in loose.

Sam Warburton – 7

A fine battle with Chris Robshaw and Wales definitely edged the breakdown battle in the first half.

Taulupe Faletau – 7

Brilliant pick up and pass from early scrum set up first try. Could have been penalised but took chance.

England

Mike Brown – 8

Caught everything that came his way and tackled superbly. A fine display from England full back.

Anthony Watson – 8

Took his try brilliantly and looked a threat every time he got the ball. Very encouraging.

Jonathan Joseph – 9

Had his hands full against Wales powerhouse defence. A couple of sloppy passes but took try brilliantly and tackled superbly.

Luther Burrell (Twelvetrees 77) – 7

The man charged with stopping Jamie Roberts did the job pretty effectively. More at home at inside centre.

Jonny May – 6

Again struggled to find the ball in open play as England’s limited attacking game failed to locate him.

George Ford – 9

A couple of early charge downs but recovered to kick important first half penalties. Managed game superbly well.

Ben Youngs –  6

Tidy display but concerns linger over his service and he does not pose running threat of old.

Joe Marler (Vunipola 55) – 7

Excellent scrummaging display from a man who has firmly established himself as England’s premier loosehead.

Dylan Hartley (Youngs 55) – 6

Asked to keep his cool and he did that well in first half. Line out radar went off which is unlike him.

Dan Cole (Brookes 62) – 8

Huge ask to start after long injury lay-off but did his job superbly. Excellent day at coalface.

Dave Attwood – 7

Put himself about well and used his physical presence to disrupt Welsh pack. Good display.

George Kruis (Easter 70) – 8

First start in the Six Nations but played like a seasoned pro. Huge prospect for England.

James Haskell – 8

Carried exceptionally throughout and tackled superbly but will have nightmares about failure to score second-half try.

Chris Robshaw (capt) – 7

Always a tireless worker and led from the front in typically dogged fashion. Huge win for him.

Billy Vunipola – 7

Got more into game as it wore on after looking off the pace early on. Carried very effectively.
