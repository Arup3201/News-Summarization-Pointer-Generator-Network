A drug addict robber who 'snuffed out the life' of a widow as she desperately clung on to a handbag containing her late husband's ashes has been found guilty of murder.

Nellie Geraghty, 79, was discovered face down in the mud just 100 yards from her home in Shaw, near Oldham, Greater Manchester, after suffering a 'most violent attack' at the hands of Mark Royle on her way to her local luncheon club.

She received serious head injuries with the 'overwhelming likelihood' that she was knocked to the ground by Royle, 37, and while lying on the floor was kicked or stamped on, a jury at Manchester Crown Court was told.

Brutal: Drug addict Mark Royle, left, has been convicted of the murder of Nellie Geraghty, 79, right. She was found face down in the mud yards from her home in Shaw near Oldham, greater Manchester, after suffering a 'most violent' attack

The prosecutor said it was the defendant’s 
intention to cause her serious harm as he violently wrenched the 
bag from her grasp last November.

The
court heard that Mrs Geraghty was an 'extremely active and independent 
lady' who lived alone on a sheltered housing estate for the elderly.

Her
husband, Frank, had died some years ago and she was so devoted to him 
she had taken to carrying some of his ashes in her shoulder bag whenever
she went out.

She also tended to carry cash of up to £200 in the bag at any given time.

Mrs Geraghty was taken to Royal Oldham Hospital but failed to regain consciousness and died in the early hours of November 26.

The cause of death was internal bleeding and a heart attack - likely to have been suffered at the crime scene.

Sentencing him to life, Judge Andrew Gilbart said: 'She made a ready victim of a
bag snatch. She was just four feet 10 inches tall and 79 years old.

Target: Mrs Geraghty clung on to her handbag, pictured, as Mark Royle desperately tried to hold onto it. The bag was later discovered in a river

Murder scene: The alleyway in Shaw, near Oldham, Greater Manchester where Nellie Geraghty, 79, was found unconscious around midday on Thursday 24th November.

'She was carrying her shoulder bag. I am sure you thought it contained 
money or other things worth stealing.

'As you tried to get it she clung 
to it, which is not surprising for she carried within it among other 
things the ashes of her late husband whose memory sill burned vividly 
for her.'

Judge Andrew Gilbart QC, told Mark Royle he 
had "snuffed out her life just to get the price of your next fix or 
two".

The handbag was dumped in a river but the ashes were not recovered.

Detectives launched an investigation and officers trawled through CCTV footage of Shaw, said the prosecutor.

Cameras
showed the defendant from 9.40am onwards riding a mountain bike in and 
around the town with no particular purpose of direction.

Prosecutor Peter Wright QC said: 'We say the reason he was doing so was he was up to no good.

'He was looking for an opportunity for crime to fund his drug habit.'

Devoted: Nellie Geraghty, 79, with her late husband Frank in 1994. Nellie was found unconscious around midday on Thursday, November 24. Her handbag, which contained her husband's ashes was missing. She subsequently died

He said that immediately after the 
attack on Mrs Geraghty the defendant was captured on camera cycling away
from the vicinity - a minute after the last known sighting of the 
pensioner.

Royle, of no fixed address, had denied the murder or manslaughter of Mrs Geraghty and also robbing her.

He shook his head as the murder verdict was returned.

Following
the verdicts, Ian Rushton, deputy chief crown prosecutor for the North 
West area said: 'Mrs Geraghty was still clutching the handle of her bag 
when she was found unconscious, evidence of how bravely she must have 
struggled to prevent her bag, and her husband's ashes, from being 
stolen.

'Mark Royle's 
actions were completely the opposite, cowardly and despicable. He 
deliberately targeted an elderly woman because she wouldn't be able to 
defend herself and used appalling violence to snatch her bag from her.

Lasting love: Nellie Geraghty, second right, with her husband Frank, right on their wedding day in 1969.

'He must have known that she was seriously injured, but his only concern after attacking her was to use the cash that he had robbed to buy drugs.

In a statement Mrs Geraghty's family said they had been overwhelmed by the response of the local community in Shaw and the general public.

It read: 'We have been left completely devastated by what this man has done to Nellie. It has left a very big empty space in all of our lives.

'The only comforting thought to us is that Nellie is now back together with her beloved Frank.

'Shaw does not deserve a monster such as Royle and we are so grateful that justice has been done. No amount of time served by him will ever bring our Nellie back.'

Sentencing will follow shortly.
