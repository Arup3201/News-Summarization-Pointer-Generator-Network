BBC director general Tony Hall asked KPMG to look into historic golden goodbye deals, but his decision was questioned

The firm investigating the BBC severance deal scandal has spent thousands of pounds wining and dining some of the executives responsible for the most controversial payoffs, it has emerged.

The corporation’s official auditor KPMG was asked by director general Tony Hall to look into historic golden goodbye deals following last month’s report by the National Audit Office, which found the BBC handed staff £369million over eight years.

But his decision was questioned yesterday after it emerged the company lavished some of the key figures in the scandal with hospitality including concert tickets, champagne and meals at top restaurants.

The BBC’s former chief financial officer Zarin Patel, who stepped down last month, accepted concert tickets on at least four occasions from KPMG. Along with human resources director Lucy Adams she also attended a dinner hosted by the firm at a top London restaurant.

In 2011, Miss Patel attended a Coldplay concert at London’s O2 Arena as a guest of KPMG associate partner Karen Wightman. The same year, she was their guest at the Royal Opera House.

Miss Patel and Miss Adams were jointly responsible for signing off all BBC severance payment deals over £500,000. Miss Adams personally approved some of the most controversial deals including a £1.02million payment to former deputy director general Mark Byford.

The BBC's group finance director Beverley Tew has also enjoyed concerts at the firm's expense. She saw blind Italian tenor Andrea Bocelli in concert and in 2010 she saw Rod Stewart perform at the O2 Arena

Other executives to benefit  from KPMG’s hospitality include Miss Adams’ deputy in the human resources department, Rachel Currie, who was taken to watch a tennis match by the firm.

The BBC’s group finance director Beverley Tew has also enjoyed concerts at the firm’s expense.

Last year, it took her to a 
performance by blind Italian tenor Andrea Bocelli and in 2010 she saw 
Rod Stewart perform at the O2 Arena.

Tory MP Rob Wilson wrote to the head 
of the National Audit Office this week asking whether KPMG ‘ought to 
have picked up on and highlighted the widespread breach of policies in 
the granting of severance payments and wider benefits by the BBC to 
departing senior managers.’ He added: ‘I am concerned KPMG might not be a
 suitable party to carry out such a review.’

A KPMG spokesman said: ‘An audit only 
looks at whether payments have been accounted for and disclosed 
appropriately in the financial statements, not whether there have been 
any breaches of policy. Occasional proportionate hospitality is a normal
 part of working life.’

A 
BBC spokesman said: ‘The BBC has strict guidelines in relation to 
accepting corporate hospitality and no guidelines have been broken. 
Neither Zarin Patel, Lucy Adams, Rachel Currie or Beverley Tew were 
involved in appointing KPMG to undertake the review of severance 
payments.’

THE BBC discriminates against Right-wing views by making its online readers aware of the ideological viewpoint of conservative think tanks but not of Left-wing ones, according to a study.

The corporation is five times more likely to include a ‘health warning’ pointing to the party affiliation of Right-wing institutions than of those of the Left when quoting their research on its website, the Centre for Policy Studies found.

Its journalists are also more likely to refer to Left-wing think tanks as being ‘independent’, implying they are more reliable. Economist Oliver Latham’s Bias At The Beeb report looked only at BBC online articles rather than its TV and radio broadcasts. 

He said the findings prove the  BBC shows a ‘Left-of-centre slant’ in  its reporting.

A BBC spokesman said it provided ‘impartial and independent coverage’ to a quarter of a billion people across the world.

He added: ‘The CPS claims to have found bias in the way we describe think tanks. We use descriptions to help our audiences understand more about each think tank and think carefully about the words used.’
