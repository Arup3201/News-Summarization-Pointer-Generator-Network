The world's biggest barbecue pit, which stretches an incredible 76ft and weighs a staggering 40 tons, has gone on sale for  $350,000.

With the ability to cook up four tons of meat at any one time, the 'Undisputable Cuz' is the behemoth of barbecue.

The pit, which attracts a lot of attention in it's hometown of Brenham, Texas, has seven smokestacks, 24 doors and a walk-in cooler with space for kegs attached to beer taps on the outside.

Weighing 40 tons, stretching 75 feet in length, ventilated by seven smokestacks, the 'Undisputable Cuz' (pictured) is described as the world's biggest barbecue pit

It is so big, the pit requires special permits and escorts just to move it down the road.

Sitting along the Highway 290, next to a sign proclaiming it as the planet's biggest barbecue pit which offers it for sale, drivers  often stop and take pictures of the 'Cuz'.

Owners Terry and Kim Folsom, who are selling it for $350,000, claim it is 'the world's largest barbecue pit.'

The incredible barbecue is on sale for a whopping $350,000 with the 2000 Peterbilt truck (pictured) thrown in for an extra $50,000

The 18-speed Peterbilt truck which used to hauled it is thrown in for an extra $50,000.

The heat for the barbecue, which is carried along the rig by a tube,  comes from a relatively small fire that burns just a couple of cords of wood.

The Folsoms, who park in in their front yard, told USA Today that its original owner used to take it on tour.

But Terry, who acquired it in a business deal, said he was happy to sell to a wealthy buyer and has listed the barbecue pit on eBay.

'Some people tell me we ought to put it back on tour,' Kim  said. 'But I'd rather just sell it and get it gone.'

'Get me a certified check and bring it on over here and give it to me they'll own it,' added Terry. 'I'll take it right where they'll need it.'
