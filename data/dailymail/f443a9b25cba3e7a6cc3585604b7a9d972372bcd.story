The Utah Jazz has been forced to apologize after seemingly endorsing a fan who donned blacface to dress up as former star player Karl Malone.

The team's Twitter account retweeted an image on Sunday depicting two fans recreating a photo of Malone and his teammate John Stockton, adding: 'Can anyone top this Halloween costume?'

The tweet was originally sent by Tyler Christensen from Logan, Utah and compares an image of him and his friend in costume with the original image of the formidable pair.

'We tried our best to recreate the dynamic duo! #stocktontomalone #utahjazz #themailman,' Christensen wrote, tweeting the message at the Utah Jazz and ESPN accounts.

After the Utah Jazz account retweeted the image in an apparent endorsement of the fans' use of blackface, it came under fire - and the tweet was promptly removed, Deadspin first reported.

'We apologize for the last retweet/tweet moments ago,' the account read minutes later on Sunday afternoon. 'We have taken it down as it may be insensitive.'

In a comment, a spokesperson added: 'Within minutes we realized the error, we deleted the Tweet and apologized to our followers.'

But other Twitter users weren't impressed.

'Blackface, really?' one Twitter user had commented. 'You guys can do better.'

Some readers branded it 'offensive', 
while others lamented at how hapless revelers choose to use blackface 
every Halloween, despite the upset it causes.

This year, a pair of Florida men shared a photograph of one wearing blackface to depict murdered teenager Trayvon Martin, while the other dressed as George Zimmerman.

In another costume choice that caused upset, Julianne Hough altered the color of her skin while attempting to embody embody Suzanne 'Crazy Eyes' Warren from Orange is the New Black.

'I am a huge fan of the show Orange Is the New Black, actress Uzo Aduba, and the character she has created,' the actress wrote on her Twitter page on Saturday.

'It certainly was never my intention to be disrespectful or demeaning to anyone in any way. I realize my costume hurt and offended people and I truly apologize.'
