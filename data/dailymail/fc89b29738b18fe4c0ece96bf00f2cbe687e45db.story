Maternity care is being cut across half of England despite a baby boom, figures show.

Five of the ten regions have slashed their budgets for maternity services in the last year with the East Midlands reducing it by 15 per cent.

Figures obtained after a parliamentary question by Lib Dem MP Andrew George also show that nine of the ten areas do not have enough midwives to ensure mothers and babies are properly cared for.

Cathy Warwick, chief executive of the Royal College of Midwives, said maternity staff are facing ‘unprecedented demands’ and ‘struggling’ to provide safe care.

Cuts: Figures revealed that five of ten regions have slashed maternity budgets

Maternity units are becoming increasingly busy due to the rising birth rate, with the number of babies rising by 23 per cent in the last decade.

Addressing the College’s annual 
conference in Telford, Shropshire, she said: ‘There is not one midwife 
practising today who has seen this level of births and demands on 
maternity services.

‘I am constantly meeting midwives and far too 
often they are telling me of the unprecedented demands on their time and
the struggle to deliver the safe, high quality care they aspire to.’

Midwives are also having to deal with more complicated labours because more  women are giving birth in their 40s - and a higher proportion are obese.

But Dr Daniel Poulter, health minister, said the numbers of midwives had increased by 1,300 in the past three years. ‘We have very safe and high quality care,’ he added.

Understaffed: The Royal College of Midwives says there should be one midwife per 28 births, but in the worst region the figure is one per 40

He said: ‘We have very safe and high-quality care and the challenge is that we continue to increase that care.’

The College recommends that within a region’s maternity services there is at least 1 midwife for every 28 births that year.

But only one region is meeting this safe-level – the North East – the other nine fall well below.

The worst is South Central with one midwife to 40 births, followed by the East of England with one to 35.8.

The figures were obtained by Mr George by a Parliamentary Question.
