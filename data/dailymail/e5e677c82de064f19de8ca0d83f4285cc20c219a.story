Saido Berahino has added to his growing reputation by being named England Under 21 player of the year.

The West Bromwich Albion striker is tipped to leave the Hawthorns this month following a red-hot start to the season.

And his stock has risen further after landing the prestigious accolade.

West Bromwich Albion striker Saido Berahino has been named England Under 21 player of the year 

Berahino scores West Brom's second goal during his side's 2-2 draw against Manchester United in October 

The striker has scored 10 goals in 13 appearances for the Under 21s and needs just three more to go level with all-time leading scorers Alan Shearer and Francis Jeffers.

His goal-scoring exploits led to his first senior call-up from Roy Hodgson for the Euro 2016 qualifier against Slovenia and the friendly against Scotland in November.

Liverpool and Tottenham Hotspur are both monitoring Berahino's future with regard to a big-money move this month.
