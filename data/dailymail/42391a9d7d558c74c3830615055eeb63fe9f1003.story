A mummified head said to be that of a Maori chief will return to its origins after more than 170 years in the UK.

The preserved head, known as a Toi moko, was brought to Britain in the 1840s and has been kept in Warrington Museum, in Cheshire, since 1843.

But after several lifetimes in the northern hemisphere, the head of the 'South Sea island chief' is to be sent back in response to a call for the repatriation of such rare items, due to their 'great cultural importance'.

Janice Hayes, the museum's manager, said: 'We don't know the precise origin of the head. We do know that the Maoris used to preserve severed heads for two reasons - either to venerate a loved one, or to ridicule an enemy defeated in battle.

Not showing his age: The Toi Moko was brought to Britain in the 1840s and kept at Warrington Museum. The Maoris considered the head to be the most sacred part of the body and it is regarded as an insult even to show a photograph of one

'But we also know that some Maoris, when they learned that Europeans would pay gold for the old artifacts, began to manufacture more heads for sale.

'But in any case, Te Papa Tongarewa, one of the national museums of New Zealand has been asking for all such artifacts to be repatriated, at their expense, and Warrington Borough Council, which currently legally owns the head, has decided to return it.'

The position of a Maori tribesmen within the tribe was identified by the tattoos on their faces, known as moko.

The more painted the face, the higher up they were within the tribe. Each additional motif, or moko, represented a rite of passage or a significant event in their lives.

Senior chiefs within a tribe had completely tattooed faces, while lower ranking members had only their chins and lips painted, for example.

Women were rarely tattooed, but all men who's faces were stamped with their own special design had their heads preserved out of respect; the preserved heads were known as mokomakai.

This tradition reigned until about the mid 19th century when it began to disappear having been corrupt by European influences.

European settlers brought with them firearms -Â  a revolutionary way of fighting as far as the Maori were concerned and something they wanted to get their hands on.

And one thing the Europeans were keen to take home were mokomakai.

And so a trade was established. The Maori would sell their mokomakai in exchange for Muskets to fight their neighbours. They would steal their neighbours heads to get more guns and even started tattooing slaves with 'fake' symbols and beheading them to sell to the foreigners.

The problem became so bad that in 1831 the governor of New South Wales banned the further trade of heads, although some trade continued.

Ms Hayes said many Samoans were of Maori origin, adding: 'In Maori culture the head is considered to be the most sacred part of the body and male warriors would have an intricate facial tattoo called a moko applied to give it additional sacred powers.

'After their death their head was smoked and dried in the sun to preserve it and ensure it was still possible to see their unique moko which allowed them to be identified, almost like a finger print.

'Because these Toi moko are so sacred to the Maori it is regarded as an insult even to show a photograph of one and the museum removed the head from public view many years ago.'

The council's executive board member for leisure, community and culture, Cllr Kate Hannon, said: 'We're proud to have had this Toi moko in Warrington Museum for all this time, and there's a lot that can be learned from artifacts like this.

'But we think it's right and proper that the head should be returned to New Zealand.

'Human remains like this are of great cultural importance to the Maoris, and we're very happy to see to it that the Toi moko is returned to where it came from a century and a half ago.'

The New Zealand Maori rugby team still perform the haka dance before their matches (stock picture - watched by British and Irish Lions players in Hamilton June 11). The rugby players have been offered a last chance to see the preserved head in the UK as part of their World Cup tour

Te Papa Tongarewa has indicated that it will want to conduct a ceremony at Warrington Museum to thank it for its care of the Toi moko before the New Zealand authorities resume custody of it.

The artifact is unlikely to be repatriated until the autumn so Warrington Borough Council intends to invite members of the New Zealand and Samoan national rugby league team to pay their respects to the Toi moko during their stay in the UK as part of the World Cup.
