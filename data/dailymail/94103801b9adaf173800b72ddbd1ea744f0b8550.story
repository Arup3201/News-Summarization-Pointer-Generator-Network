A teacher has admitted to having sex with a cheerleader after she was confronted with naked photos she had sent him, authorities have said.

Ashley Elizabeth Zehnder, a 24-year-old biology teacher at Pasadena High School in Houston, Texas, has been charged with having an improper relationship with a student.

Zehnder met the 17-year-old student, who was a member of the cheer squad, while she worked as assistant cheer coach, according to court documents.

The investigation began when Zehnder went to school officials and complained about a naked picture that was being swapped among students, KTRK reported.

Officials at Pasadena Independent School District began investigating on October 1 and when staff asked the boy how he got the image, he admitted she had sent it to him through Snapchat.

He also admitted to staff that they had been in a sexual relationship since May 2014, KHOU reported.

Prosecutors say Zehnder, who has a boyfriend, had a sexual relationship with the student throughout the entire summer, KTRK reported.

Zehnder initially denied the relationship, but when confronted with the photograph, she admitted that she had sent the naked photo to the teenager through Snapchat.

She resigned from her position on October 9. 

'These charges are very serious and this behavior will not be tolerated in Pasadena ISD,' the district said in a statement. 

'When an educator violates the trust of a student, it makes it difficult for the majority of teachers who genuinely care for the safety and well-being of students.'

Zehnder has since been charged with an improper relationship with a student, a second-degree felony charge, and is out of jail after posting a $10,000 bond.

According to her Facebook page, she is in a long-term relationship.
