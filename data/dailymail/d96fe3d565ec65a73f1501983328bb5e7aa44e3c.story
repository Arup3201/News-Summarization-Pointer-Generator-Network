This brings new meaning to the term fast food.

Frightening footage has surfaced of a fridge toppling off the back of moving ute and skidding across the path of oncoming traffic on a bustling highway in Brisbane.

The dash-cam vision, which comes from Ipswich road, begins with traffic moving down a busy thoroughfare on a cloudy day.

After passing a road-sign, the fridge plunges over the back of the tray and slides across the road, forcing quick thinking drivers to swerve out of its path.

The video was uploaded to YouTube  on Thursday by Angelilina Lulu,  who has  uploaded several other dash-cam videos to her account.

According to the Department of Transport and Main Roads for Queensland, any vehicle carrying a load must secure the load so it won’t move or fall from the vehicles while driving.

Loads must be restrained using an appropriate restraint method so they will not eject into the path of traffic or pedestrians.

Failing to secure the load properly can result in a fine or, for a serious breach, a prosecution in court.

In 2010, a fridge fell off the back of a lorry truck in Britain, crushing a grandmother to death.

Susan Russell, 54, was cycling to work when the nine-ton fridge slipped from the vehicle and fell on her, killing her instantly in Hull, East Yorkshire.

Lorry driver Mark Smith, 47, from Bradford, had only placed two safety belts around the industrial appliance that should have been held in place by dozens of straps.
