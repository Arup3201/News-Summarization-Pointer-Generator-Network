Hundreds of vintage car enthusiasts battled driving rain - not to mention quite a few breakdowns -  during the London to Brighton Veteran Car Run today.

Of the 449 competitors who set out from London's Hyde Park in torrential rain and bitter cold at 8am, 77 cars never made their final destination.

But coping with mishaps, technical difficulties and the elements was all part of the fun for those testing the collection of rare and wonderful pre-1905 built vehicles against the 63 mile route.

Event spokesman Rebecca Nicholls 
said: 'The weather was absolutely horrendous, probably the worst in 
years, but it didn't dampen spirits.

'These entrants are a hardy bunch. It's a big enough challenge to drive one of theses vintage cars in the 
wonderful summer sunshine, but to drive the 63 miles from London's Hyde 
Park to Brighton in torrential rain and cold, exposed to the elements is
so much more difficult.

'With these old cars, so much more attention has to be paid before doing what seems very easy in modern cars. Just braking or changing gears can take a great deal of effort. And this is made all the more difficult by the cold and rain.

'It really is a case of coaxing and cajoling these machines to the finish line.'

But she added: 'Once everyone thaws out, I'm sure many entrants will starting planning for next year's event.'

Participants
left London's Hyde Park on Sunday at 8am this morning, driving through 
Redhill, Surrey, heading for Madeira Drive on Brighton seafront.

First across the line, in little more than two hours, at 10.21am, was Ian Moore in his 1899 Panhard et Levassor.

Trailing in many hours later was last placed Derek Payne from Brisbane, Australia, in a 1901 De Dion Bouton.

British racing driver Sir Stirling Moss, legendary petrol-head Pink
Floyd drummer Nick Mason and Coronation Street actor Tony Hirst, were 
among the 449 entrants taking part in this year's event.

But
one of the most tense races saw man pitted against machine in a rather unusual challenge.

Ultramarathon runner 
Duncan Philips, from Tunbridge Wells, Kent, challenged American 
veteran car driver Dan Suskin to see would be the first to reach 
Brighton.

Incredibly, both crossed the finish line together.

The annual London to Brighton Royal Automobile Club Veteran Car Run is said to be the world's oldest motoring event.

Despite the mounting age of vehicles taking part in this years event, the rate of attrition has improved since the rally was first run.

In 1896, 33 motorists set off from London but only 14 made it to the seaside.

All vehicles must be driven at an average speed of no more than 20mph and, in case of breakdowns, outside assistance is only permitted at designated locations.

Each year the event has a chosen 
country to celebrate and in 2012 it is Great Britain – tying in with the
Queen’s Diamond Jubilee celebrations and the London 2012 Olympic and 
Paralympic Games. The London to Brighton Veteran Car Run will support 
The Royal British Legion.
