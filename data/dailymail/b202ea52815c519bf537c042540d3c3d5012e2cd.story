It’s the group from hell, right? We’ve got no chance. Even that gentleman from the Football Association reckoned so. Drew a finger across his throat when the draw was made. We’ll be home before the business end of Wimbledon begins. Anyone for tennis?

So let us start with that gloomy grab-bag of presumption. England do not have to steer a path through what the locals would call the inferno in Brazil this month. Even of late, they have had it worse, and qualified.

In 2002 in Japan, for instance, Sven Goran Eriksson’s squad were up against Sweden, who they had not defeated since 1968, Argentina and Nigeria. Even in the last campaign, the 2012 European Championship, England faced France, Sweden again and the hosts, Ukraine.

Group of death: Greg Dyke's slit-throat gesture showed what he thought of England's World Cup chances following the draw but he couldn't be more wrong

They made it through that time, too. Group D – Italy, Uruguay and Costa Rica – sounds harder than it is, and not least because the matches come in precisely the right order.

England could have had it better when the names came out of the hat, obviously, but they could not have improved on the schedule, a visit to tropical Manaus aside. It is, frankly pointless, however, complaining that a Brazilian World Cup is taking the team beyond its comfort zone into the Amazonian rainforest, as that is what a World Cup outside the Eurozone will always do.

There will be heat, humidity, relatively remote locations and steps into the unknown and the sooner English football realises that and stops whinging about the weather every time a major tournament arrives, the more seriously this country will be taken as a competing nation. Not every competition can be held in Germany. And we stunk that joint out, mostly, in 2006 if you remember.

So: Italy, Uruguay, Costa Rica – in that order. Got lucky there, didn’t we, whatever the FA’s resident drama queen might say. What if the fixtures had been reversed? Costa Rica in Manaus first, Italy last. Tricky, that.

No fear: Wayne Rooney and England struck lucky with their group and should reach the last eight

The first game of a tournament is invariably cagey and Roy Hodgson, England’s manager, is not a natural risk-taker. Yet Costa Rica demand to be beaten, and beaten well, if goal difference is going to come into play as it often can in a tight group. England would be stepping into the unknown. Would 1-0 do? What if it was a draw? And imagine a draw, with Italy to play last.

Glenn Hoddle took England to the 1998 World Cup by getting a result against the Italians, but his requirement was a draw in Rome. The fact is, England are playing Italy at precisely the right time, first – and in a location that offers equal disadvantage to all.

When Dennis Bergkamp signed for Arsenal in 1995, Sir Alan Sugar, then in his capacity as chairman of Tottenham Hotspur, wondered how the expensive new arrival would fare when the cold weather kicked in.

Downbeat: Antonio Cassano's Italy haven't won for seven games and on Wednesday drew with Luxembourg

June 14 - Italy, Manuas (11pm)

June 19 - Uruguay, Sao Paulo (8pm)

June 24 - Costa Rica, Belo Horizonte (5pm)

This appeared to be a world view based on all of Italy being the temperature of Sardinia in July. Bergkamp was arriving from Milan, where a real fur coat is still a fashion accessory at the opera. It is fair to presume that nobody wears fur to the famous Teatro Amazonas opera house in Manaus.

Turin, where Italian champions Juventus are based, hosted the Winter Olympics in 2006. Amazonian Brazil is just as inhospitable to most Italian players as it will be to their English opponents. Cesare Prandelli, Italy’s coach, has been working in sweat boxes and attempting scientific exercises in energy conservation just the same. And Italy are, by their footballing nature, cautious to begin with.

It is another reason to play them first. Since the war, Italy have been involved in 14 opening fixtures at World Cups and for a supposed footballing powerhouse, have won just half of them.

No great shakes: West Brom reject Diego Lugano (left) is Uruguay's captain - which says it all

They have never won any opening group game by more than two goals in that time – not even against Haiti in 1974 – and three of those seven wins have been achieved by a single goal margin. Faced with a dangerous opponent, Italy most often draw – against West Germany in 1962, Poland in 1982, Bulgaria in 1986, Chile in 1998 and Paraguay in 2010.

Italy versus England in Manaus is the shortest price of any group game at the tournament to be a 0-0 draw: 7-1. Backing the stalemate is usually a mug’s game because a goal at either end kills the bet, but enough fancy it here for the bookmakers to lay at unappealing odds.

Why? Italy are outs of sorts, haven’t won since September and drew 1-1 with Luxembourg in a friendly last week. They are perceived as cautious starters, Hodgson is perceived as cautious. Conditions in Manaus will be oppressive.

Easily beatable: Costa Rica keeper Keilor Navas might have a lot of work to do during the tournament

In 13 World Cups England have only lost two opening games. Both times they made the quarter-finals

The pace of the game will be slow, wary, exhausting. If it gets to 70 minutes without a goal all instincts will be to settle. And, having not lost to the most difficult group opponents, England would be on their way.

Uruguay are no great shakes. They have a great player, in Luis Suarez and one not far behind in Edinson Cavani, but five teams from nine in South America qualified for this tournament and Uruguay were last through the door via a play-off with Jordan.

Nobody knows what shape Suarez will be in come June 19 in Sao Paulo, either. In other words they are beatable. A South American team on its own continent will always be a test but while the ordinary Diego Lugano, formerly of West Bromwich Albion, captains Uruguay, this not a match to be feared, but taken on.

Difficult start: Sven Goran Eriksson's England had a tougher group in 2002 than the current team have

Leaving Costa Rica, by which time England’s destiny may be known. If England need to win, they should win. If they need to win by a margin, that should not be beyond possibility either. Qualify and one from Colombia, Ivory Coast, Japan and Greece await in the next round.

Jose Mourinho tipped England to reach the last eight, at least, and he is no poor judge. England should have every reason to anticipate and experience the colour and warmth of football’s spiritual homecoming without fear or despair.

Nobody is predicting triumph – but disaster should be equally foreign to this campaign. We can have a go. We should have a go. What would be the point otherwise?
