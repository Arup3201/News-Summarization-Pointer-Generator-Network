Wikipedia has put a ten day total ban on edits made from computers within the US Congress after a series of changes on entries that promoted conspiracy theories or made humorous changes to notable people's profiles.

Edits to the page of Lee Harvey Oswald claimed that he assassinated President John F Kennedy 'on behalf of the regime of Fidel Castro' and former US Defense Secretary Donald Rumsfled is described as a 'lizard alien'.

A representative from the Capitol building said that the ban was caused by the actions of 'two or three' and was drawn to attention by the Twitter account, @congressedits which automatically tweets page changes by IP address from within Congress.

Banned: Computers of the US Congress have been banned from editing Wikipedia for ten days

The changes were brought to the attention of Wikipedia administrators when an edit was made from a House IP address for the website Mediaite, calling the media blog 'sexist' and 'transphobic' and alleging that it 'automatically assumes that someone is male without any evidence.'

The website had written a story beforehand about the false edits coming from computers in the Capitol building.

Jimmy Wales, the founder of Wikipedia, told the BBC that he was far from shocked by the edits and that it has 'always gone and it always will.'

However, he did say that the Twitter feed may have been responsible in part for some of the more outrageous edits.

'There is a belief from some of the Wikipedia community that it only provoked someone - some prankster there in the office - to have an audience now for the pranks, and actually encouraged them rather than discouraged them.'

He added to the BBC: 'Maybe someone at the House of Representatives better think about their IT staff - they might be hunting them down this very moment.'

Wikipedia can be edited by an user any time and anonymously, but the changes are monitored by the website's volunteers, known as Wikipedians.

They reverse rogue editing and sometimes ban users who continually change entries.

It has emerged that Wikipedia has been warning users from Congress since March 2012 and banned them for 10 days from Thursday.

Since its creation only two weeks ago, the @congressedits account has published more than 130 tweets, the vast majority of which highlight edits ranging from simple grammatical and the relative prettiness of hats in Congress according to the Daily Caller.
