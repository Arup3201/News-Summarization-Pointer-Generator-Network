It was somehow apt that Eoin Morgan should talk of England’s need for a more aggressive one-day approach at the World Cup on the day Rohit Sharma smashed a world record 264 for India against Sri Lanka.

For nothing sums up the magnitude of Alastair Cook’s task in Australia and New Zealand better than the fact that Rohit’s score would have been enough on its own to defeat England in seven of their last 10 one-day internationals.

Morgan, one of the few England batsmen who could get somewhere close to Rohit’s heroics if given enough time, attempted to place the feat in context at Lord’s while admitting that different World Cup tactics will be needed.

‘I suppose the comparison to that is us bowling a team out for 140 which we have done before in our conditions,’ said Morgan when asked about the small matter of India’s 404 for five in Kolkata.

‘It depends where you are playing. If we were playing in India or at the Oval every game then you might see the odd score like that from us. Remember India are two up in the series with their tails up, too. You never know what’s possible.’

Still, the suspicion remains that England, with their emphasis on the old-fashioned way of keeping wickets in hand for a late burst from the likes of Morgan and Jos Buttler, are still playing a very different game to that seen in Kolkata.

Morgan, a key man when England go to Sri Lanka on Sunday for a seven-match one-day series to prepare for their latest attempt to make an impact at the World Cup, agrees up to a point.

‘Building a platform can work in England but I’m not sure we can backload it as much in Australia,’ said Morgan, who was below his best for much of last season before finding his innovative touch again in the final Twenty20 international against India. ‘The one-day series there last winter was a huge eye-opener, especially the way the Aussies took us on. We will need to be more explosive throughout the innings, not just at the start, with us all taking more responsibility.’

The role of Cook at the top of England’s one-day order remains an issue. It is perfectly possible for England’s captain to bat through 50-overs for a hundred plus. But is that enough these days and does his strike-rate put pressure on those that follow?

‘Cook is an excellent player and an excellent captain,’ said Morgan. ‘He has been light on runs but then so have I and so has Ian Bell. Cooky can score quickly enough. Every time we have a rain affected one-day match he always seems to find another way to score and he has huge respect in the dressing room.

‘He does have another gear. It’s just that, with the amount of Test cricket he’s played, he has honed his game to that and hasn’t had a huge amount of opportunity to develop specific one-day skills. The next four months are key to him being able to do that but he is an unbelievable player and I expect him to score runs and lead us to more one-day series wins.’

It is a view on Cook the one-day player that is made more interesting by the fact that Morgan remains one of Kevin Pietersen’s best friends in the England team and talked sympathetically about the exiled star at Lord’s.

The Irishman insisted that Roy Keane’s book rather than Pietersen’s was his reading of choice on holiday - ‘but I’ve heard Kev’s book is excellent,’ he smiled – and denied that his closeness to Pietersen has proved a problem with England.

Morgan says he finds it 'terribly sad' that his friend Kevin Pietersen is not in the England team

‘I don’t feel I was caught in the middle of anything and it hasn’t been awkward for me being a friend of Kev,’ said Morgan. ‘It’s great having played with him and learned from him and I just feel it’s terribly sad that he’s not in the team at the moment being so young and with potentially his best years ahead of him.

‘That’s just the way I feel. I would love to be out here playing cricket with Kevin Pietersen again but the fact of the matter is he’s not involved anymore.’

And in Pietersen’s absence it is Morgan more than most who will have to deliver if England are going to get anywhere near emulating the likes of defending champions India and doing well at the next World Cup.
