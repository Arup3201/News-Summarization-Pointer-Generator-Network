It's not something you ever expect to see waiting for you in bed.

The large four metre snake was found atop a bed in a home in Morayfield, north of Brisbane in Australia.

The residents were aware the snake lived on their property but had never come this close to the slippery reptile.

'They [the residents] have watched it grow up, they knew all about the snake, it probably just snuck into their house if the door was left open,' Julia Baker a snake wrangler in Brisbane told Daily Mail Australia.

'They're used to it, I think they called me because it was in a bedroom and they weren't sure how to get it out,' she said.

Ms Baker described the carpet python as 'not dangerous' but also advised not to touch or threaten snakes as they will attack in defense.

She removed the large non-venomous snake from the Morayfield home using a large hook and a canvas bag.

'I have to report every snake I capture, it's a very regulated business but I love it,' said Ms Baker known as the Snake Sheila.

Ms Baker became a snake catcher after painful divorce she decided to focus on the things that brought her happiness - one of them being snakes.

About 10 years ago the serpant professional discovered her love for snakes when at Australia Zoo.

'I just fell in love, I felt so differently to everyone else getting a photo with the snakes, they all walked away saying 'yuck! they feel so gross' but I found them to be so beautiful and misunderstood.'

It was then that Ms Baker set in motion what would become her snake capturing business.

'I get to meet people and see so much incredible wildlife, it's a dream for me,' she explained, 'I particularly like educating people on snakes and converting them into snake lovers too.'

The UK- expat is keen to spread the word that snakes shouldn't be feared.

'They're not dangerous. They will never chase a person, that's just an urban myth,' Ms Baker said, 'They won't attack unless they feel threatened.'

The snake captured in the Morayfield home was released back on the resident's acreage.

'I really love that they have embraced the fact that their home is also the snakes home, they can live together and not fear one another, it truly is a beautiful thing.'

'I'm on a mission to get rid of this 'a good snake's a dead snake' attitude. It's crap. We need snakes. They play and important part in our ecosystem,' she told Nine News.

Ms Baker is passionate about educating children about our wildlife and helping prevent hatred and fear towards reptiles. 'I ALWAYS get a buzz out of watching children overcome their fears and enjoy a pat of the non-venomous Carpet Pythons.'

But has the ever been bitten?

'Yes! A few pythons and whip snakes, but nothing deadly!

Ms Baker reccomends having a snake catcher's number on speed dial as it comes into snake season in Australia.

Snake season starts in September and continues into summer.
