Lord Darzi, one of the country's top surgeons, said it was irrelevant who provided treatment for the NHS - as long as it was good

The growing Labour civil war over the NHS deepened last night after a former health minister attacked proposals to stop private firms being used to provide treatment.

Lord Darzi, one of the country's top surgeons, said it was irrelevant who provided treatment for the NHS - as long as it was good.

It comes after former Health Secretary Alan Milburn said Labour's attack on NHS competition was a 'fatal mistake' which could cost it the election.

Ed Miliband has pledged to repeal the Government health reforms and slash private sector involvement in the NHS.

The Labour leader this week claimed he needed to 'rescue the National Health Service' from the Tories.

Under Labour's plan, private health firms and charities would only be allowed to provide treatment to 'support' the NHS – for example, if there was sudden increase in waiting times.

Shadow health secretary Andy Burnham has accused the coalition of putting 'an alien ideology at the heart of the NHS' by making the NHS put all its services out to the market, allowing private companies to bid for contracts to provide treatment.

He has refused to say how much he would cut the private sector's involvement in the NHS - but insisted the amount of money spent by the NHS on outsourced treatment was too high.

Official figures showed less than 6 per cent of the NHS budget is outsourced to private and not-for-profit sectors.

But of this, more than 4.4 per cent of the NHS 'privatisation' happened under Labour – including when Mr Burnham was health secretary.

Speaking to BBC Newsnight last night Lord Darzi said the NHS should prefer providers who delivered the highest quality care - whether they are 'public, private or not-for-profit'.

He said: 'If the debate doesn't focus on the quality of care, then every patient and every clinician will know that the real argument about what matters has already been lost.'

Julian Le Grand, a former senior policy advisor to ex-Prime Minister Tony Blair, and an architect of many Labour health reforms, added that competition within the health service 'seems to work'.

He said: 'We learnt in the Blair government that you have to have pressure from outside if you're going to reform a poorly performing hospital.

'That pressure can come from competition. It seems to work, it's a good thing to have and if Andy Burnham ends up pouring more money into the health service without that, that money is going to be wasted.'

The NHS outsourced 4.4 per cent of its budget under the Labour party - but less than 2 per cent under the Coalition

On Wednesday, David Cameron accused Labour of being 'completely useless' and accused Mr Miliband of a 'disgraceful' bid to 'weaponising' the NHS to win votes

On Wednesday, David Cameron accused Labour of being 'completely useless' and accused Mr Miliband of a 'disgraceful' bid to 'weaponising' the NHS to win votes.

The Prime Minister said Mr Miliband was grasping at straws as he is in a 'desperate mess on the NHS'.

Overall, the Coalition has contracted out half as much of the NHS budget to the private sector as Labour did in power.

During the four years from 2006/07, Labour outsourced 0.5 per cent of the NHS budget every 12 months, while the Coalition has only contracted out 0.25 per each year.

Mr Burnham, appearing on Newsnight earlier this week, insisted Labour only brought in private sector capacity 'to bring down waiting lists'.

Under Labour's planned overhaul of the NHS, the NHS would be banned from buying in treatment from private health firms before they had tried to do it themselves.

He said: 'I am clear, the market is not the answer to 21st century health and care. If we allow market forces to continue to take hold, they will eventually break the NHS apart.'

Mr Burnham's proposals were slammed by the Blairite former health secretary Alan Milburn.

He said: 'You have got a pale imitation of the 1992 general election campaign, and maybe it will have the same outcome, I don't know.

'But it would be a fatal mistake, in my view, for Labour to go into this election looking as though it is the party that will better resource the National Health Service but not necessarily put its foot to the floor when it comes to reforming it.'
