Brigitte Bardot yesterday threatened to follow actor Gerard Depardieu in taking Russian citizenship unless two elephants are reprieved from being put down.

The Sixties sex symbol and animal rights campaigner is furious over plans to end the lives of Baby and Nepal, after both contracted tuberculosis at a Lyon zoo.

She said: ‘If the powers that be have the cowardice and the shamelessness to kill Baby and Nepal, I have decided to take Russian nationality and quit this country that is nothing more an animal cemetery.’

The 78-year-old star has also supported Depardieu, 64, in his row with the socialist French government over high taxes, saying he had been the ‘victim of extremely unfair persecution’.

The Sixties’ sex symbol and veteran animal rights campaigner is furious over plans to end the lives of Baby and Nepal. Both contracted tuberculosis at a Lyon zoo.

He was this week granted Russian citizenship by leader Vladimir Putin who Bardot has previously dubbed 'my favourite prime minister'.

The ex-KGB spy - now president and no longer premier - won Bardot’s admiration for his concern for animal welfare which critics say masks his contempt for human rights.

City authorities said the elephants had to be put down after contracting tuberculosis

Bardot yesterday made clear she was 
ready to follow Depardieu, 64, to Moscow due to her concern over the 
fate of the elephants which are deemed a threat to the health of other 
animals and visitors to the Tete d’Or zoo in Lyon.

City
 authorities ordered the elephants to be put down last month but a 
petition organised by their original owner, circus master Gilbert 
Edelstein, led to a temporary reprieve over Christmas.

The star yesterday threatened to quit France unless the stay of execution is made permanent.

Putin delighted her in 2011 by banning the import and export of harp seal skins.

Last
 month she said Depardieu - branded 'pathetic' by French Prime Minister 
Jean-Marc Ayrault - had been the 'victim of extremely unfair 
persecution'.

He objects to French president Francois Hollande’s planned 75 per cent top rate of tax.

Meanwhile Russians yesterday mocked Depardieu for claiming the country was a 'great democracy' under Putin, 
who says he has a 'very friendly personal relationship' with the actor.

One opposition leader challenged him to come to a protest rally where he could face arrest.

But glamorous television host Tina Kandelaki was ready to help him when it comes to registering his address, a duty for all Russians.

'I’m ready to let him register as a resident in my apartment, he can stay as long as he likes,' she said.
