Super Hornet planes cost up to £35million and have a long history in Iraq. They were deployed in both the Persian Gulf War in 1991 and the eight-year-long Iraq War, which began in 2003. 

The destruction of IS targets in Syria and Iraq aims to limit the terrorist's group ability to lead, control and conduct operations. 

Bahrain, Jordan, Saudi Arabia, Qatar and the United Arab Emirates have joined the US in participating in the airstrikes against ISIS.

Although the RAF has started bombing targets in Iraq, the Prime Minister has ruled out sending ground troops. 

The US launched air strikes in Iraq in August and Syria, in September. 

The plane costs up to £35million and is the main fighter-bomber of the Navy - it was also deployed in the Gulf War in 1991 and the Iraq War in 2003

The fighter planes will target IS fighters, training compounds, headquarters and command and control facilities, storage facilities, supply trucks and armed vehicles

IS has declared a so-called caliphate in the areas it has taken, and is also holding a number of hostages.

Although currently limited to Iraq and Syria, IS has promised to 'break the borders' of Jordan and Lebanon and to 'free Palestine'. 

Countries participating: US, Bahrain, Jordan, Saudi Arabia, Qatar, United Arab Emirates

Targets: Islamic State fighters, training compounds, headquarters and command and control facilities, storage facilities, a finance center, supply trucks and armed vehicles in the vicinity of Raqqa, Dayr az Zawr, Al-Hasakah and Abu Kamal

U.S. missiles: 47 Tomahawk Land Attack Missiles launched from the USS Arleigh Burke and USS Philippine Sea, operating from international waters in the Red Sea and North Arabian Gulf

U.S. aircraft: Air Force B-1 bombers, F-15E attack planes, F-16 fighters and F-22 fighters; Navy F/A-18 fighters; two types of drone aircraft

Other strikes: The U.S. alone also conducted eight strikes against the al-Qaida-affiliated Khorasan Group west of Aleppo, including training camps, an explosives and munitions production facility, a communication building and command-and-control facilities
