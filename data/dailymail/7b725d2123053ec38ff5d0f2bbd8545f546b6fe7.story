The mother of murdered toddler James Bulger has been subjected to vile abuse by a Twitter troll who made fun of the two-year-old's death.

The Twitter profile, named ‘James Bulger’s Ghost’, contains images of the child's gravestone and mocks his murder in Walton, Merseyside in 1993 - describing James as 'dancing on train tracks'.

James' mother Denise Fergus wrote on Twitter after learning of the tweets: 'Look at what c*** I am getting off some idiot.'

Sick: The Twitter profile, named 'James Bulger's Ghost', contains images of the child's gravestone and mocks his murder in Walton, Merseyside in 1993 - describing James as 'dancing on train tracks'

The anonymous account holder has 
published sickening jibes about James’ 1993 murder by two 10-year-olds, 
along with a reference to Peter Connelly - the toddler better known as 
Baby P, who died as a result of child abuse in 2007.

One post 
pretending to be James Bulger reads: 'While it cannot be argued that my 
physical existence is somewhat dead, my spirit is pretty much alive.'

Another tweet contains a link to a children’s musical cartoon, with the poster making references to railway tracks.

Police
 confirmed on Twitter that they are investigating the posts, and Ms 
Fergus urged her 23,000 followers to report the trolls to Twitter 
officials.

The 'James Bulger's Ghost' account is not the first time Twitter trolls have contacted his mother Denise Fergus.

In March this year a poster posing as Jon Venables - one of the toddler's killers - sent a series of vile tweets making light of his death.

Using the name @SirJVenables the troll also wrote vile messages about harbouring a desire to kill more children.

The account was shut down by Twitter after users contacted police to complain.

The troll wrote to Ms Fergus: 'His little life shattered with one blow, through his catatonic eyes'.

They also tweeted: 'You want me to get serious, become a gormless fool like the rest of you? No thanks, I'll stay true to myself and plot your child's death'.

In November last year a Twitter user who posted pictures purporting to be of James Bulger's killer Jon Venables as an adult was given a 14-month suspended prison sentence.

Security guard James Baines was handed the sentence, suspended for 15 months, at London's High Court for contempt of court.

A 2001 injunction binding on the whole world prohibits the publication of any information alleging to identify the appearance, whereabouts, movements or new identities of Venables or Robert Thompson.

The
 James Bulger Memorial Trust charity was set-up by Denise Fergus in 
2011, and provides holidays to bereaved children and victims of crime.

A spokesman for the Trust said: 'This amounts to criminal abuse and harassment and it should be stopped.'

'Denise has held meetings with representatives of Twitter and she is in direct contact with the police over the matter.

'We are satisfied that everything possible is being done to bring this vile abuse and harrassment to an end.'

A
 spokesman for Merseyside Police said: 'We can confirm that officers 
from the Matrix Serious & Organised Crime Cyber Support Unit were 
made aware last night, Tuesday, 20 May of an allegation regarding 
potentially offensive tweets.'

'Detectives
 are now examining the tweets and inquiries into the report are being 
carried out. Officers will also liaise with twitter as required.'

Twitter
 users who post offensive tweets can be prosecuted under various laws 
including the Protection from Harassment Act 1997 and the Malicious 
Communications Act 1993.

They could also be open actions for civil damages for defamation or distress.

James
 Bulger was just two-years-old when he was abducted from The Strand 
shopping centre in Bootle, Merseyside, in February 1993, by Jon Venables
 and Robert Thompson. 

His body was discovered on railway lines two days later.
