Warring Liberal Democrat MPs were last night told to stop plotting to bring down Nick Clegg.

Lib Dem grandee Lord Razzall claimed MPs were rocked by polls predicting humiliation at the next Election , but urged them to rally round the Deputy PM – or face an even bigger defeat in 2015.

Lord Razzall, former Lib Dem campaigns chief, compared the ‘manoeuvrings’ of ambitious Lib Dem MPs to the way former party leader Charles Kennedy was toppled after a long-running whispering campaign.

‘It looks like some colleagues are preparing for life after Clegg,’ Lord Razzall told The Mail on Sunday. ‘I call on them not to encourage rumours.’

Lord Razzall, whose memoir Chance Encounters reveals he thinks Kennedy was brought down by a ‘conspiracy’, refused to say which MPs he was referring to. However, several were linked to leadership bids last week.

Treasury Chief Secretary Danny Alexander, Health Minister Norman Lamb and Equalities Minister Jo Swinson have all been named as preferred candidates to stop the bookies’ favourite, party president Tim Farron.
