With £2 million to spend, a house buyer might expect to be able to find something rather spectacular.

But those shopping around the Kensington area of West London should think again.

These pictures show the £2 million, two-bedroom home which even estate agents admit is a 'wreck'.

This West London property, which even estate agents admit is a 'wreck', went on the market for £2 million

While it may look respectable from the front - situated at the end of a tidy row of terraced homes near Hyde Park - the inside of the home tells a different story.

Behind the smart front door, potential buyers are met with exposed brickwork, tired floorboards and crumbling plaster.

Even the estate agent, Crayson, described the house as ‘wrecksville’ and warned potential buyers that it would cost a fortune to renovate.

For the same price, a nine-bedroom, Grade II-listed home could be bought with Savills in Somerset.

In Manchester, meanwhile, a collection of 37 properties are being offered to buyers for the same price by one business.

And in Bristol, a two-bedroom home requiring full restoration would set a buyer back approximately £100,000.

But despite the home costing 11 times the average across England and Wales, there was said to be no shortage of interest.

The home, on Abingdon Road, is just off Kensington High Street and a short distance from Hyde Park and some of London's best-known areas.

Floorplans show it currently has two bedrooms and three reception rooms.

Crayson described the property as a ‘complete wreck in one of London's great residential areas and everything to play for’.

The advert added: ‘The property represents an epic opportunity to buy a shell, create the perfect space and live somewhere that is actually made for you.

‘It's the sort of house where you can imagine retiring and pottering about in the village vibe that, amazingly, still exists in the quiet back streets of Kensington.’

While the front may look appealing, the view from the back garden gives a better indication of what lies inside

The property is still advertised on the website of Crayson and Zoopla with a 'sold' sign. However, it is understood the owner has now decided to take the property off the market and renovate it themselves.

Last year, 193 houses in Kensington sold for more than £1 million with an average price of £2.87 million. Car parking spaces alone sell for £300,000 in the area.

Zoopla figures show the average asking price in 'W8' is £5.1 million.
