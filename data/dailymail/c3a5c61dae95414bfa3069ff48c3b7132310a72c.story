The judge who will sentence former Virginia Governor Bob McDonnell for public corruption Tuesday has been inundated with 443 letters attesting to the Republican's integrity and asking for mercy on his behalf.

The letter writers include family members, former colleagues, neighbors, longtime friends, priests and state legislators. 

Even Democratic US Sen. Tim Kaine and former state House Democratic leader Ward Armstrong put in a good word for the Republican politician.

McDonnell, once widely considered a top prospect for national office, will be sentenced Tuesday on 11 counts.

Awaiting his fate: The judge who will sentence former Virginia Gov. Bob McDonnell Tuesday (pictured here after his conviction in September) has received over 400 letters of support 

Nearly all the letters describe McDonnell as an honorable man who did not intend to break the law when he and family members accepted more than $165,000 in gifts and loans from a vitamin executive who was seeking government support for his company's products. 

Some questioned why the executive, former Star Scientific CEO Jonnie Williams, got immunity for testifying against McDonnell.

Some relatives blamed McDonnell's troubles on his wife, Maureen, who was convicted of eight counts and was portrayed at trial as emotionally unstable and eager to cash in on Williams' free-spending ways. 

She will be sentenced for her role in the corruption scheme February 20.

Bob McDonnell's attorneys have asked US District Judge James Spencer to order three years of community service. 

Prosecutors say in court papers that the claims of good character are belied by McDonnell's lack of remorse and willingness to blame others. They want a prison sentence of at least 10 years.

One of the letters sent to judge Spencer ahead of McDonnell's sentencing was penned by his eldest daughter, Jeanine McDonnell Zubowsky, who called her father 'the least materialistic person that I have ever known.' 

'My mom, in contrast, has always been concerned about getting discounts or freebees. ... She hid her coordination with people for free or discounted things or services and she didn't communicate with my dad because she knew he would not approve,' wrote the oldest of the five McDonnell children.

Zubowsky said her father quietly endured his wife's screaming when they fought over the way Maureen McDonnell mistreated other people.

'The testimony about my mom was not just part of a defense strategy and was not an attempt to 'throw her under the bus,' but unfortunately, was the reality,' she wrote.

Nancy McDonnell Naisawald said her big brother, Bob, was unaware of many of his wife's actions.

'He only learned of his wife's many inappropriate interactions with Williams after the investigation began,' she wrote. 'He surrounded his wife with many trusted staff and advisors to help her adjust to her position as First lady. She neither trusted nor accepted their advice, preferring to make her own misguided choices.'

Bob McDonnell's youngest sister, also named Maureen, offered a new example of her sister-in-law's 'inappropriate behavior' — a letter 25 years ago to sister Maureen's college boyfriend, an unnamed NFL quarterback, requesting money and asking him not to tell Bob.

'The tragedy is, none of us, including me, wanted to tell Bob about his wife's conduct for fear of hurting him, particularly when he was so busy as a state delegate and lawyer to running the Commonwealth and Republican Governors Association,' she wrote in her letter of support for her big brother. 'Our silence, in an effort to protect Bob, is something we all have to live with.'

Rachel McDonnell, the McDonnells' youngest child, said that her mother showed her some designer clothing and accessories Williams bought for her.

Supporters in academia: Both University of Virginia President Teresa A. Sullivan (left) and former Virginia Tech President Charles W. Steger (right) wrote that McDonnell never made any inappropriate requests 

Bob McDonnell's youngest sister wrote that no one wanted to tell him about his wife's 'inappropriate behavior,' including her allegedly requesting money from an NFL quarterback  

'She specifically told me not to tell my dad that Jonnie purchased these items for her because she knew this is not something he would approve,' she wrote, adding that her father also didn't know that she and her sister used Williams' airline points for a trip to Savannah, Georgia.

'Please do not hold my dad accountable for my family's actions when he was not aware of everything that was going on.'

Tim Kaine, a Democrat, praised McDonnell for restoring the voting rights of more than 8,000 felons, more than any previous governor.

'I am convinced that Governor McDonnell showed mercy to convicted felons not for political reasons or because he had anything personally to gain by doing so. The merciful attitude exhibited by this positive action is characteristic of him as an individual,' the senator wrote.

University of Virginia President Teresa A. Sullivan wrote that if McDonnell had wanted to pressure the university to research anything, he had many opportunities to do so in their private conversations. She added, 'Never, at any time, was there any pressure put on me of this sort.'

Former Virginia Tech President Charles W. Steger likewise wrote that McDonnell never made any inappropriate requests. 

He added: 'With all due respect, it is of considerable concern to me that Mr. Williams was granted immunity from prosecution. Actions such as this contribute to the loss of public confidence in our institutions.'

McDonnell's lawyers argued in briefs filed late last month that the sentence sought by prosecutors is overly harsh for a defendant who devoted his life to 'honorable public service' but made errors in judgment that destroyed his once-promising career and left his personal life in shambles.

The government, meanwhile, said McDonnell remains unrepentant and 'will not relent in shifting blame for his own actions to others' — including his wife and co-defendant, Maureen — and that he deserves at least 10 years in prison for selling the influence of his office.

In the four months since his conviction, McDonnell remained estranged from his wife of 38 years, but the two came together to celebrate Thanksgiving and Christmas with their children.
