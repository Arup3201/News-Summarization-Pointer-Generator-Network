The ex-wife of JFK assassin Lee Harvey Oswald is putting his wedding ring up for auction as she breaks the final ties to what she describes as the 'worst day of my life'.

Marina Oswald Porter, who celebrated her 72nd birthday this week, has given the band up to be auctioned in New Hampshire after it was returned to her following 50 years lost in an attorney's folder of legal papers from the trial.

The ring is expected to sell for up to $50,000 and is accompanied by a fascinating letter written by Mrs Porter which gives the background to the historical object.

A small section, revealed to The Dallas Morning News,  reads: 'At this time of my life, I don’t 
wish to have Lee’s ring in my possession because symbolicly [sic] I want
to let go of my past that is connecting with Nov. 22, 1963.'

Mrs Porter, who is living on a fixed income, the newspaper reported, will keep the proceeds from the sale. 

In the letter she writes that the ring, which has a
tiny engraving of a hammer and sickle,  was bought by Oswald in Minsk in 
1961 shortly before the couple returned to the U.S.

The ring was left on the couple's bedside table on November 22, 1963 when Oswald set out to kill the President.

Oswald was himself later shot and killed by Dallas nightclub owner Jack Ruby while in police custody.

Mrs
Porter has been remarried for many years and has children and 
grandchildren. She has closely guarded her privacy since she was thrown 
into the national spotlight by her then-husband's devastating actions 
almost 50 years ago.

She had refused to speak publicly as the 50th anniversary of President Kennedy's assassination approaches. 

The wedding band was discovered in 2004 stuck in a manila folder at a Forth Worth law firm.

It was among the papers of Forrest Markward, a lawyer who represented Mrs Porter following the Kennedy assassination.

After several years of legal tussles, the ring was returned by post to Mrs Porter in an envelope marked 'Treasury Department Secret Service'.

The auction will be held on October 24 and also sees other historical items connected to the tragic day go under the hammer.

Lee Harvey Oswald assassinated President Kennedy on November 22, 1963, in downtown Dallas.

Oswald then fatally shot Officer J.D. Tippit and was arrested at the Texas Theatre in the city. 

The 
50th anniversary has been gaining attention in recent months as everyone
from museum curators to musicians have embarked on projects to remember
the event.

The city of Dallas will hold a commemoration November 22 in 
Dealey Plaza, where Kennedy's motorcade was passing as shots rang out.
