Two nurses who contracted Ebola while caring for Thomas Eric Duncan - the first person to be diagnosed with, and die of the virus in the United States - have been hailed as heroes by their colleagues. 

Nurses Nina Pham, 26, and Amber Vinson, 29, were diagnosed last week after caring for Mr Duncan before he went into isolation at Dallas Presbyterian Hospital and was extremely contagious. 

While they are being treated in two different hospitals across the country, their fellow staff members spoke of their support for the pair as they defended the hospital following weeks of negative media coverage.

Chief nursing officer at Cole Edmonson said the nurses were 'devastated' by Mr Duncan's death, but nevertheless 'proud' of their work.

Praise: Chief nursing officer at Dallas Presbyterian Hospital Cole Edmonson said the nurses were 'devastated' by Thomas Eric Duncan's death, but nevertheless 'proud' of their work

Defiant: The nurses showed their support for their hospital after weeks of being criticized. However they would not elaborate on investigations into the treatment of Mr Duncan 

During the news conference, nurse Julie Irving insisted the group had 'worked tirelessly' to save the Liberian, who died on October 8.

'This could have happened to any hospital,' she said. 

'Some things went wrong and we are proud to say that Presbyterian has owned those things, and will make us stronger and more diligent when it comes to saving lives in the future.'

Nurse Chantea Irving added: 'A lot has been said about our hospital in recent weeks. Some of it accurate, some of it wildly inaccurate. That has been very frustrating, disappointing and hard on our nurses.'

However the trio did not elaborate on ongoing investigations as to why the patient was sent home with just antibiotics after his initial visit to the hospital.

Duncan arrived at Texas Health Presbyterian on September 26, but was sent home only with antibiotics despite telling a nurse he had recently been to West Africa.

He returned two days later in an ambulance when his symptoms worsened and was diagnosed and isolated. 

Pham tested positive for Ebola in Dallas on October 12, making her the first person to contract the deadly virus in the United States. Vinson tested positive for Ebola on October 15.

Pham is being treated National Institutes of Health hospital in Bethesda, Maryland while Vinson is in the Emory University Hospital in Atlanta, Georgia
