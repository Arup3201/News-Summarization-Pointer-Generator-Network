A Great White shark seals the fate of this hapless sea creature - as it launches itself clear out of the water to snatch a snack.

The dramatic series of images were captured at Seal Island, off the coast of Cape Town, South Africa.

Photographer Chris McLennan, from New Zealand, snapped 28 shark breaches in a single hour.

The notorious shark-infested waters are said to be one of the only places in the world where sharks breach when hunting their prey - the Cape fur seal.

Snap happy: A great white shark breaches the water at Seal Island, off the coast of Cape Town, South Africa. Unfortunately its dinner was a decoy seal deployed by photographer Chris McLennan to capture this amazing image

Chris, an award winning international travel photographer, said: 'The behaviour of the Great White sharks in this area is unique. I wanted to get the Holy Grail of shark images - the breach with a natural predation.

'Anyone who has photographed wildlife will know sightings of this type of behaviour are still rare to witness and more difficult to catch on camera.'

Chris used a decoy seal towed by a boat during the second day of his trip when there was a lull in activity.

But he still managed to capture real-life nature in action.

Force of nature: The enormous Great White, which can weigh more than 1,000kilos, soars several feet clear of the water as it hits the decoy seal

Clamping down: The ferocious predator sinks its razor-sharp rows of teeth into a seal just a few feet from where photographer Chris McLennan had his camera set up

He added: 'The only way to get a photo
 of this live action is to spot the seals returning from offshore 
fishing and then focus on a lone seal or one that has dropped off the 
back of a group.

'By tracking just one seal, if you are lucky and the seal is not, you might get to see some action.

'We
 witnessed our first breach within minutes of sunrise I had a breach 
shot within the first half hour. The action continued and we witnessed 
28 predations in an hour - of which I managed to photograph three. Then 
it all went quite.'

Skill: Award-winning photographer Chris McLennan honed in on a lonely seal which had become separated from the pack and vulnerable to attack in order to narrow his chances of spotting a stunning Great White shark breaching the water
