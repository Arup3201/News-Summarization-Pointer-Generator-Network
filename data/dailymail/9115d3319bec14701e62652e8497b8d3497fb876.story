A 59-year-old man who was lucky to survive a bear attack has spoken of the dramatic moment he and his pet dog fought the animal off.

Steven Krichbaum, of Staunton, Virginia, came across the black bear and her two cubs while walking in the woods in Hardy County, West Virginia, with his yellow Labrador mix Henry.

Mr Krichbaum and his dog were both seriously injured after the bear attacked, while fearing for the safety of her cubs, at the George Washington National Forest on Thursday.

He has now described how Henry distracted the bear as it attacked him, before he managed to strike the bear in the head with a rock.

'I didn't want to killer her,' Mr Krichbaum told The Northern Virginia Daily. 'I wanted her to go away and stop biting me.'

Mr Krichbaum told the paper how he remembered the moment the bear sunk its teeth into his leg during the attack after his dog chased the two cubs into the forest.

Mr Krichbaum said while he was being attacked his dog Henry managed to distract the bear, who then went for the pet, which allowed him to pick up a rock.

Mr Krichbaum then struck the bear in the head with the rock, allowing him and his dog to return to their car before driving to a Frederick County fruit market in search of assistance.

Mr Krichbaum was then taken to Winchester Medical Center where he received treatment for the severe injuries.

The bear has since evaded attempts to capture it following the attack, the Associated Press has reported.

Traps were set by the West Virginia Division of Natural Resources the day after the attack but removed on Monday.

Colin Carpenter, the West Virginia Division of Natural Resource’s black bear project leader, told The Winchester Star on Friday that authorities planned to kill the bear and her cubs if they captured them.

An online petition however was set up calling for the plans to be revised.

The petition, posted on change.org, had 2,000 signatures by yesterday.

Jamie Sajecki, Virginia’s black bear project leader, told The Northern Virginia Daily, how the state does not take action against bears if they are provoked into attacking, which he said is what appears to have happened in this instance.

He said: 'Because the dog precipitated this event, we wouldn’t necessarily put a bear down in that situation because she was out in her habitat where she should have been.'
