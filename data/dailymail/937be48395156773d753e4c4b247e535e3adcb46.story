The White House went on lockdown early Saturday morning after an alert from a bomb-sniffing dog.

At the same time, a loud noise was heard and smoke was seen by the South Lawn.

This all happened just before President Obama and his family were preparing to takeoff on Marine One to go to Andrews Air Force Base and then Selma, Alabama.

Press covering the event were immediately rushed back in and members of the Secret Service went to work trying to determine what was happening.

A food truck fire is responsible for the loud noise and smoke, while a suspicious vehicle was detected by the dog.

The First Family was heading to Selma for a special 50th anniversary ceremony marking the historic march.

President Obama will deliver a speech to commemorate the event. 

The lockdown happened around 10am,  and the situation is now contained and not considered to be a serious threat.

It ended around 11am, and President Obama and his family eventually traveled to Andrews by motorcade rather than helicopter. 

There were no reported injuries from the fire.

'K9 alerted on a vehicle at 16th and Constitution at approx. 10:10 this morning,' Agent Brian Leary said in an email to The Hill. 

'It is being investigated now.'

He then added; 'One of the vendor carts at 15th and G apparently had a smoke or fire issue that is now contained.'

Firefighters were attending to that incident, and one individual managed to get video of the fire which they posted to YouTube.
