A surge in obesity among dogs is being blamed on rules limiting where they can run off the lead.

Half of Britain’s eight million dogs are now classified as overweight – a dramatic leap from just 35 per cent of the nation’s canine population in 2010.

Experts believe a growing restriction on dogs exercising in public spaces is the cause, along with owners allowing their pets to overfeed.

Councils have made increasing use of the Dog Control Orders introduced in 2006 to stop dogs being let off the lead in public areas.

While the ban has been welcomed in children’s parks and cemeteries, its implementation elsewhere has been called draconian. 

Popular beaches restricting dogs being exercised off the lead include Polzeath, north Cornwall and Salcombe South Sands in Devon.

Dog owners are also angry about a move to ban dogs off the lead from 60 per cent of the 550-acre woodland at Burnham Beeches, Buckinghamshire. A decision is due next month.

The unhealthy lifestyle of the 21st Century dog is revealed in a new TV series presented by leading vet Mark Evans. 

Cassie, a black rescue labrador, will appear on new TV series Dogs: Their Secret Lives 

Dogs: Their Secret Lives features footage from secret cameras which track Chancer, a Cavalier King Charles spaniel, and Cassie, a black rescue labrador, to find out why they are so fat.

Mr Evans said: ‘I am convinced that lack of exercise is a major cause of the problem. In the past two years there has been a 25 per cent reduction in the number of British people who now exercise their dogs off the lead.’

He said the 50 per cent figure for the number of obese dogs in Britain was based on research from Liverpool University, home of the UK’s only specialist pet obesity clinic. 

The dogs featured in the TV series are both discovered to be overfed: spaniel Chancer weighed in at the clinic at 37lb. Her owner, Jane Burton, 52, from Birkenhead, could not understand why she was so fat when she was only fed a can of pet food each morning and evening.

But a secret camera exposed how the family pet was being over-indulged with treats every day.

One of the main culprits was Mrs Burton’s own mother, Joan Clement, 89, who has Alzheimer’s.

Eight-year-old Cassie, a black labrador, arrived at the clinic weighing 103lb. Her owner, Adrian Jackson, 46, a company director. from Burscough, Lancashire, said: ‘We got her from a rescue centre and we noticed she wolfed down her food as soon as she got it. We think she wasn’t fed properly by previous owners.’

But cameras showed that not only was Cassie greedy, her owners were overfeeding her, and spoiling her with treats.

Both dogs are now on diets.

In Nottinghamshire, Newark and Sherwood District Council has used Dog Control Orders in 72 separate areas.

Polzeath beach in north Cornwall is one of the many popular beaches that has banned dogs off their leads

Local dog owner Nathan Bray, 41, said: ‘Our dog, Dexter, a pointer, needs a lot of exercise, but we’ve had to put him on the lead. He’s not been at all happy by the lack of freedom and he’s got chubby from the lack of exercise.’ 

James Yeats, RSPCA chief veterinary officer, said: ‘Dog Control Orders are problematic and if they cause people not to exercise their dogs and they carry on feeding their pet in the same way, the dogs will become overweight. It is a major issue.’
