Killer: Christopher Halliwell, 48, of Swindon, was jailed last week for 25 years at Bristol Crown Court

The taxi driver who stabbed to death an office worker owned 80 cars and 'must have' struck in the eight-year gap between his two murders, police believe.

Authorities believe Christopher Halliwell
may well have struck in the gap between murdering Sian O'Callaghan and his
first victim Rebecca Godden, 20 - whom he confessed to killing but 
escaped justice due to a police blunder.

The divorced father-of-three was jailed 
for 25 years last week for murdering Miss O'Callaghan, 22, who 
disappeared after leaving a nightclub in March of last year after a 
night out with friends.

Now it has emerged Halliwell has worked across the country and owned about 80 different vehicles which he could have used to pick up more victims.

He is believed to have used his job 
as a taxi driver to target women outside clubs and in red light 
districts - and studied forensics to keep ahead of police, reported the Daily Mirror.

A
police source told the newspaper: ‘It is inconceivable there was an 
eight-year gap between the murder of Becky and Sian with no further 
crimes… Had he not been arrested for Sian’s murder, he would have gone 
on to attack more women.’

The source said police are looking at a
‘potential offending period of more than 30 years’ since his teens and 
they believe he was ‘very forensically aware’.

It has also emerged that Halliwell, 48, of Swindon, allegedly once asked a fellow inmate: ‘How many do you need to be a serial killer?’.

He is said to have asked the question about serial killers aged 20 while in prison after being jailed for four years in 1984 for raiding upmarket country homes for antiques.

His cellmate replied: ‘At least three’, before he reportedly asked the prisoner: ‘Have you ever thought of strangling your girlfriend during sex?’

The chilling conversation between the inmates is said to have emerged when police officers were investigating Halliwell over the two murders.

It comes following revelations from 
Halliwell’s ex-lover Heather Widdowson that they had sex just hours 
after he murdered Miss O'Callaghan.

She was unaware when she got into bed 
with him that he had abducted and stabbed the woman - and claimed 
he was ‘laughing and joking’.

The ex-lover also told the Sun 
that he texted her to say he loved her shortly before he carried 
out his brutal attack on Miss O'Callaghan.

The office worker was making her way 
back to the home she shared with her boyfriend after leaving Swindon's 
Suju nightclub when she got into Halliwell's green Toyota Avensis taxi.

Instead of taking her home, the killer
drove Miss O'Callaghan to nearby Savernake Forest where he sexually 
assaulted and killed her.

The cab driver also moved Miss 
O'Callaghan's body to a location in Uffington, Oxfordshire. He 
eventually led police to her remains following his arrest later in the month of March in 2011.

Halliwell's ex-wife Lisa, a nurse, 
said the killer collected his teenage son in his taxi the day after his 
attack on Miss O'Callaghan. She said he sent a grovelling letter to 
his family for forgiveness.

It has also emerged that Halliwell could now face questioning over a string of unsolved killings.

Sentencing him last week to at least 
25 years for Miss O'Callaghan's murder, Mrs Justice Cox DBE said 
he abused his position as a taxi driver - and the woman would have suffered 'extreme fear'.

Halliwell escaped justice over the 
charge related to Miss Godden’s death after a judge ruled his legal 
rights had been breached by detectives during the course of their 
investigations.

Christopher Halliwell has been urged by his daughter to give the family of a second woman he killed 'justice' over her murder.

Natasha Halliwell said her father, who is beginning a life sentence for the murder of nightclubber Sian O’Callaghan, should 'do the right thing' and 'tell the truth' over the murder of missing prostitute Rebecca Godden.

'He needs to give the other family closure as well and give them the justice they need for their daughter,' she told ITV Daybreak.

Ms Halliwell said she had received letters from her father but she has not replied to them. She said he had urged her to change her name a number of times.

'We have had quite a few letters that have said ‘Sorry for putting you all through this’ and things like this,' she said.

She added: 'As much as I want to hate him, I can’t. I pity him and I do feel sorry for him and I hate what he has done but I can’t hate him.'

Investigation: Police search woods near Uffington, Oxfordshire, where Sian O'Callaghan's body was found

The suspension of the senior detective who persuaded Halliwell to lead him to his victims’ bodies is worrying, his supporters say.

Detective Superintendent Steve Fulcher was suspended on full pay three weeks ago and is being probed by the Independent Police Complaints Commission over a blunder during the case.

Despite the detective persuading Halliwell to lead him to the graves of two victims, he failed to read him his rights - which meant the killer's confession of murdering Miss Goddard was inadmissible in court.

But former Metropolitan Police detective chief inspector Colin Sutton told the Daily Telegraph that DS Fulcher made  reasonable judgments 'in a dynamic and fast moving situation’.

And Home Affairs Committee chair Keith Vaz (pictured) said the case could prompt a reform of the Police and Criminal Evidence Act 1984, as policing has ‘changed enormously’ in 28 years.

Meanwhile Police Superintendents’ Association president Derek Barnett told the Telegraph police officers are expected to ‘prioritise the protection of life as the first and foremost consideration’.
