A girl who lost her foot when Syrian jets bombarded her home is just one of the thousands of refugees whose hardship is unleashing a 'staggering humanitarian crisis' in the Middle East, an aid agency said today

Sharifa's new home is now a dirty, hardscrabble refugee camp near Turkey, where she is just one of the children growing up confused and far from home.

The hijab-clad girl, who needs crutches to move around the camp, weeps for her lost limb. 'I can't get it back,' she told CNN.

'I just want to walk again. I just want to walk,' she told the news network. 'I don't want to play again, I just want to walk.'

Syria's civil war is unleashing a 'staggering humanitarian crisis' on the Middle East as hundreds of thousands of refugees flee violence including gang rape, the International Rescue Committee (IRC) said today.

Over 600,000 Syrians have fled abroad - many to neighbouring Turkey, Lebanon and Jordan - as violence has spread and international efforts to find a political solution have sagged.

Like many of her young peers who have been uprooted from their homes by the conflict, Sharifa's life has been hijacked - but the defiant girl remains resilient and one day hopes to return to her village.

She wants to continue her studies and become a teacher. But while Syria remains gripped by violence between government and rebel forces, that is unlikely to happen soon.

Opposition activists today claimed an air strike on rebel-held territory south-west of Damascus killed 20 people, including women and children.

The death toll adds to the more than 60,000 people estimated to have been killed in the 21-month-old conflict.

Elsewhere conditions in other refugee camps are even worse than those endured by Sharifa and her family. Heavy rains at the Zataaria camp in Jordan have repeatedly flooded the fragile tents where thousands are housed.

A CNN report claims that some nights nearly 2,000 refugees arrive fleeing the violence in Syria and the agencies running the camp have not got the resources to cope with the influx.

And with young children among many of those turning up the situation needs urgent action.

Andrew Harper, UNHCR's representative to Jordan, told CNN: 'About 20 per cent of the population is under the age of four. We are getting children five days old, nine days old, ten days old and they are coming across in these sorts of conditions.

'We knew this was coming, we knew that the weather was going to get worse and it's not going to be the last of the wet weather and the snow unfortunately.'

Asked why the agency had not provided more prefabricated housing for the refugees streaming across the border, Mr Harper replied: 'That's money, simple as that. Our funding is about 25 to 50 per cent of what we asked for.'

In the 23 page report by the New York-based IRC, published today, refugees interviewed by the NGO cited sexual violence as the main reason they fled Syria.

Gang rapes often happened in front of family members and women had been kidnapped, raped, tortured and killed, it said.

'After decades of working in war and disaster zones, the IRC knows that women and girls suffer physical and sexual violence in every conflict. Syria is no exception,' the group added.

Rebels and government forces have both been accused of human rights abuses during the conflict, which began with protests against President Bashar al-Assad in March 2011.

The unrest soon turned violent and has since become a full-scale civil war.

Fierce winter weather has worsened the plight of hundreds of thousands of refugees. The IRC urged donors to step up planning and funding in the expectation that more Syrians will flee.

'Nearly two years into Syria's civil war, the region faces a staggering humanitarian disaster,' the IRC report said.

Despite advancing in Syria's north and east and winning support from regional powers like Turkey and Saudi Arabia, the Syrian rebels have been unable to break a military stalemate with government forces elsewhere.

They have struggled to counter government air power in particular, making it hard for them to take and hold territory crucial to Assad's grip on power, including major cities.

An activist in Moadamiyeh, a rebel-held town southwest of Damascus, said an air strike there killed 20 people on Monday.

Activist video footage showed images of the limp body of a boy being pulled out from broken concrete, his back covered in dust and his front in blood.

The Syrian Observatory for Human Rights, a London-based monitoring group, said at least 13 people had died in the air raid but the toll was likely to rise.

Syrian state television said 'terrorists' - its word for rebels - had fired a mortar from the Damascus suburb of Daraya on a civilian building in Moadamiyeh, killing women and children.

The reports could not be independently verified because of government restrictions on independent media in Syria.

Syrian warplanes also bombarded the strategic Taftanaz air base that rebels seized last week, the Observatory said.

In another sign of escalating bloodshed, Human Rights Watch said it had evidence that government forces had used multi-barrel rocket launchers to deliver Egyptian-made cluster munitions in recent attacks.

'Syria is escalating and expanding its use of cluster munitions, despite international condemnation of its embrace of this banned weapon,' it said.

Syria's rising death toll has brought international intervention no closer. The U.S. and Russia have been deadlocked over how to resolve the crisis.

Moscow - which has continued to back its long-standing ally and arms client Assad - urged the opposition on Sunday to make its own proposals in response to a speech by President Assad a week ago.

The speech, which reportedly offered no concessions, was criticised by the United Nations and U.S. Syrian rebels described it as a renewed declaration of war.

Talks between Russia and the U.S. in Geneva on Friday failed to produce a breakthrough. As diplomatic efforts have stalled, the conflict has continued to draw in Syria's neighbours.

A mortar round apparently fired from Syria crashed in a field in Turkey overnight close to a refugee camp housing thousands of Syrians along the border, Turkish state media said.

NATO troops have begun deploying Patriot defence missiles in Turkey against a potential attack from its southern neighbour. The missiles are expected to be operational by the end of the month. Turkey is a strong supporter of the Syrian rebels.

Nato said Syrian government forces had launched a short-range, Scud-style ballistic missile on Sunday, bringing to more than 20 the number launched in the past month.

The missiles, apparently fired against opposition targets, landed in Syrian territory, mostly in northern Syria, a Nato spokeswoman said in Brussels, but some of the missiles landed 'quite close' to the Turkish frontier.
