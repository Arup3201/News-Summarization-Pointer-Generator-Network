When Cindy Batchelor looks back at her first encounter with money, she remembers counting each cent of her single mother's waitressing tips, at the age of eight, to see what groceries they could afford to buy that day.

Then, only two years ago, she found herself stepping into the role of a single mother herself when her husband tragically died in a paragliding accident.

Now, a head figure of one of the country's biggest banks, the executive general manager of National Australia Bank (NAB) has defied the odds and is helping other women do the same.

Cindy Batchelor (far right) and her three siblings (pictured) were raised by their mother (left) and grandmother (right) after being abandoned by their father. 'We were very much living on the edge of the poverty line. Mum got paid a minimum wage and earned the majority of her wage through tips. She would put them in a glass jar and we would count them out each day and that was our grocery money,' Ms Batchelor said

Ms Batchelor, who works with business women around the country, first recognised the importance of women being financially literate and independent at an age far younger than most.

Decades later, as the executive general manager of NAB Business, Ms Batchelor is inspiring other women to overcome their adversaries

Her mother, Elizabeth, was left to raise four children on her own when Ms Batchelor's father abandoned them, deciding he no longer wanted to see his children.

'Mum is very bright, but she was not educated. She had left school at 16 and never worked because she was the wife of a doctor in the 1960s with a young family,' Ms Batchelor told Daily Mail Australia.

'She found herself with four children under the age of nine by the time she was 27, so she had to quickly work out how to manage money and a household.

'She became a waitress and started studying. She got a scholarship for a bachelor in science and law and was waitressing at night. We were very much living on the edge of the poverty line and as the eldest daughter I stepped into the surrogate mother role. 

'Mum got paid a minimum wage and earned the majority of her wage through tips. She would put them in a glass jar and we would count them out each day and that was our grocery money.'

Ms Batchelor 's family situation meant that she was forced to become financially independent at 19 when she began studying an accounting degree by night and working through the day, leading her into a human resources position that lasted for 20 years.

It was watching her mother's financial confidence and literacy grow that helped her step out of a dark place when her own husband John died in 2013. Pictured with her two son's, Jackson and Billy, Ms Batchelor found herself stepping into the role of a single mother

Watching her mother's financial confidence and literacy grow is one of the reasons Ms Batchelor was proud to launch NAB's Start Counting program, which focuses on teaching women from all walks of life strong money and life habits while instilling financial confidence and awareness.

But it also helped her step out of a dark place when her own husband John died in 2013.

'He was fond of flying, but paragliding was his passion. He spent seven years doing it and it was one of those days when it was a beautiful day and the sky was blue, but it's all about the wind,' Ms Batchelor said.

'Half of his paraglider collapsed and he wasn't able to recover that and he was too close to the ground. It wasn't a lack of experience, it was that moment in nature that you can't control.

Grateful for the strong women in her life, including her mother and grandmother, Ms Batchelor said she considered it her responsibility to give back and help other women more broadly

'The hardest thing I've ever done in my life was telling their children they'd lost their father - not through something they couldn't prepare for, but just so suddenly. 

'It has been challenging, and having children living through that means I think back to mum and how my father wasn't there, and now I have to step into that void for my own children.'

'I go back to my roots and who my mum was and the values and skills she taught me - she's 71 and retired now and lives on the Sunshine Coast and she still rings me once a fortnight to tell me what's happening on the share market and what Bloomberg says today.'

Grateful for the strong women in her life, including her mother and grandmother, Ms Batchelor said she considered it her responsibility to give back and help other women more broadly.

Aside from the financial programs she supports, the mother-of-two has now been a supporter of the Women's Agenda Leadership Awards for the past three years.

She has supported the Women's Agenda Leadership Awards for the last three years and helped to launch NAB's Start Counting program, which focuses on teaching women from all walks of life strong money and life habits while instilling financial confidence and awareness

The awards honour womens' achievements in businesses and the community and saw the likes of Lucy Perry and Tracy Howe recognised for their work with Hamlin Fistula Ethiopia (Australia) and the NSW Council of Social Services, respectively. 

'We had 400 people together sharing stories about positivity where women are making a difference, supporting each other and creating really powerful networks,' Ms Batchelor said. 

'Women are 50 per cent of the population; we have to make sure we give them opportunities to shine. Historically and culturally women haven't been supported, rewarded or recognise for their achievements. We need to create more environments for that, for them to share the great things they do.'
