A woman has raised hundreds of pounds for a cancer charity after growing a moustache for Movember.

Linda Cook, who describes herself as 'quite a hairy girly', did not pluck, wax or remove any of her facial hair for the whole of last month.

The 49-year-old wanted to raise money and awareness after her husband Robin, 54, was diagnosed with prostate cancer in March.

Linda, who helps her husband run an online soft toy business from their home in Horncastle, Lincs., said: 'I wanted to do something to help the cancer charity and I thought "why not grow a moustache?"

'Robin wasn't keen to start with but he's got used to it, which is more than I have. It doesn't feel right to poke your tongue out of your mouth and touch fuzz.

'I have tried putting lipstick on too but I look like a bad transvestite.'

Robin was diagnosed with cancer after he went for a routine prostate cancer check-up earlier this year.

After diagnosing it in the early stages, doctors removed the tumour  in October and Robin was given the all-clear.

Movember is an annual event in which men around the world grow moustaches to raise awareness about prostate and testicular cancer and mental health issues.

Linda, who has been married to Robin for 28 years, added: 'I was watching TV when an advert came on with Bill Bailey telling men to get themselves checked for prostate cancer.

'I nagged Robin to go and it came back positive. Luckily, they caught it early before it had a chance to spread.

'After he was given the all-clear I was determined to raise money for the charity and when Movember came along I thought to myself, "I can do that."

'Because I have multiple sclerosis I can't do sponsored walks or runs but I can grow facial hair.

'I've always been quite a hairy girly right from a teenager. I used to bleach it and now pluck it with tweezers. It just seems quite a simple thing to do.

'Most of the ladies go "Gosh, you are so brave" but I'm not doing anything.

'Normally I pluck every morning. It's like the routine - you cleanse, tone, moisturise, brush your teeth, pull the hairs out.'

Linda has been wearing a T-shirt to explain why she has facial hair. She is having her 'fuzz' waxed off today at a local beauty salon.

She added: 'It's so going to hurt - I'm like a wolf. My tweezers are coming back to being my best friend again, if they forgive me. 

'Back in Victorian times I would be in a freak show for bearded ladies.'

Husband Robin added: 'I'm looking forward to having a smooth faced Linda back. I'm overwhelmed by her courage. She is bonkers but she's got a heart of gold.'
