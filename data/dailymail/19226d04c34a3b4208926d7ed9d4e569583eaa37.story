The verbal crossfire over the Severn Bridge began on Monday with Wales coach Warren Gatland tipping England to ‘kick the leather’ off the ball in their Six Nations opener at the Millennium Stadium.

Gatland has a history of delivering spikey messages through the media and the barrel was half-loaded when he suggested that Stuart Lancaster’s side will go back to basics in Cardiff next month.

Wales were able to name a relatively settled 34-man party at their squad announcement in the Vale of Glamorgan, where the Kiwi was keen to point out that England are still scratching heads over their ideal combinations.

Forwards: Gethin Jenkins (Cardiff Blues), Paul James (Bath), Rob Evans (Scarlets), Aaron Jarvis (Ospreys), Samson Lee (Scarlets), Scott Andrews (Cardiff Blues), Richard Hibbard (Gloucester), Kristian Dacey (Cardiff Blues), Scott Baldwin (Ospreys), Alun Wyn Jones (Ospreys), Jake Ball (Scarlets), Bradley Davies (Wasps), Luke Charteris (Racing Metro), Dan Lydiate (Ospreys), James King (Ospreys), Sam Warburton (Cardiff Blues, capt), Justin Tipuric (Ospreys), Taulupe Faletau (Newport Gwent Dragons).

Backs: Mike Phillips (Racing Metro), Rhys Webb (Ospreys), Gareth Davies (Scarlets), Dan Biggar (Ospreys), Rhys Priestland (Scarlets), Gareth Anscombe (Cardiff Blues), Cory Allen (Cardiff Blues), Jamie Roberts (Racing Metro), Jonathan Davies (Clermont Auvergne), Scott Williams (Scarlets), Tyler Morgan (Newport Gwent Dragons), Hallam Amos (Newport Gwent Dragons), Alex Cuthbert (Cardiff Blues), George North (Northampton Saints), Liam Williams (Scarlets), Leigh Halfpenny (Toulon).

‘We are probably lucky in that we know where our selection is at,’ said Gatland. ‘I think England are still debating which way they go, particularly at 10 and the midfield; that’s going to determine the type of game they play coming into the World Cup.

‘They are not 100 per cent sure themselves whether they are going to play a nine or 10 man game, or more expansively. Teams are probably going to come and kick the leather off against us; we expect England to kick everything and we have got to be prepared for that.’

England’s last Six Nations visit to Cardiff was in 2013, when a 30-3 defeat blew their chances of a first Grand Slam since 2003 and allowed Wales to clinch the trophy in heart-breaking style.

‘It was probably a deep wound that’s taken a while to heal,’ said Gatland. ‘I’m interested to see if the roof is open or closed, because the atmosphere was pretty electric that night. They may decide to leave the roof open and try to dampen down the crowd. I hope they don’t close it and accept that challenge, but we’ll wait and see.’

As revealed by Sportsmail, Kiwi No 10 Gareth Anscombe was the most eye-catching inclusion at Gatland’s squad announcement. The 23-year-old, who won the 2011 Junior World Cup with New Zealand, moved to Wales in November and is eligible for selection through his Cardiff-born mother. He arrived with a glowing reference from former All Blacks assistant Wayne Smith, who coached the youngster at the Waikato Chiefs before his switch to Europe.

Anscombe will compete with Dan Biggar and Bath-bound Rhys Priestland for the No 10 jersey, while Leicester youngster Owen Williams must wait a little longer for his opportunity. There had been suggestions that Williams would not be considered for selection because of his decision to sign a contract in England, however Gatland revealed the 22-year-old was still in contention before he was dropped for the Champions Cup tie against the Scarlets.

‘For me, the best way for Owen to develop as a 10 was to stay at Leicester and have couple of years there at a quality side,’ said Gatland. ‘I can understand Owen’s decision to stay at Leicester and he’s shown loyalty, which is good. It didn’t help him by not starting last week. It was a pretty important game to play in, but they decided to pick Freddie Burns. For me, if he had started and played well then it would have been much more of a debating point. ‘

Williams looks like one for the future, while the omission of tight-head prop Adam Jones suggests that his international career is now consigned to the past. The 33-year-old has not played for Wales since the first summer Test in South Africa, where he was hauled off after 30 minutes because he lacked basic fitness. Gatland claims that the door is still, but the selection of Scott Andrews - who has not started a league match this season and played in the second row at the weekend - suggests that it is close to being slammed shut.

Fitness is one of Gatland’s hottest subjects and his squad will be put through their paces when they convene in camp early next week. The 51-year-old has a decent idea of his strongest XV, but there have been suggestions of a shake up in the back-three, where stalwart winger George North could be named on the bench. North missed November’s victory over South Africa and Gatland said it would be ‘pretty hard’ to change that winning formula, which featured Liam Williams and Alex Cuthbert, who recently turned down a dual contract, on the wings.

But ultimately it all boils down to the bigger picture of the World Cup. The Six Nations opener in Cardiff is a dress rehearsal for September’s Pool A match at Twickenham and, with detailed analysis carried out on opponents, Gatland is keen to keep a few tricks up his sleeve.

‘You don’t want to show your hand completely,’ he said. ‘We’ve got to keep something in our repertoire that’s a little bit different.’
