Being able to pull their own pints is a pub-goer's dream.

And now punters at Britain's first iPub will be able to do just that - as barmaids have been ditched for iPads.

Landlord Mark Lingwood has cut the queues The Westbourne pub in Swansea, South Wales, which allows drinkers to help themselves to lager on pumps - as well as snacks from the bar.

The tablets are fixed to tables at the digital-friendly boozer, which cost the 33-year-old £20,000 to develop.

He said: It's something I have looked at for a long time, it's a great, fun idea.

'Why queue at the bar when you can use our table top iPads?'

Drinkers at the newly refurbished pub first have to buy a special card to use the iPads.

There's an app for that! Mark's is the first iPub to open in Britain - allowing punters to help themselves

This is then placed under a sensor on the iPad to allowing them to pour themselves pints using the pumps fixed to three of the bar-room tables.

Bar staff can see how much punters are drinking using a central system - and they check up on them to make sure they are getting on OK.

Mr Lingwood had to clear his new system with Swansea Counci's licensing department but was given the backing for his iPub.

The pub currently has Sagres and Amstel beers on the self-service taps.

But customers can order any drink to be delivered to the table using the tablet computers.

The pub's staff aim to bring snacks and other orders over to drinkers within two minutes of them placing an order.

Satisfied customer Keith Leyshon, 37, said: 'I never thought they'd be able to make a computer to improve drinking - but they have.

'I used to hate queueing at the bar, it was the worst part of any night out.

'But with these iPads I just help myself. It's hard not to get carried away.'
