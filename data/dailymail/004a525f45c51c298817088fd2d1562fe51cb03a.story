US General Joseph Dunford said 'time's 
going to tell' whether it was premature for Nato to end combat 
operations this spring

Western troops are likely to remain in Afghanistan beyond 2015 in order to help develop the Afghan air force and intelligence capability, a Nato commander has said.

Some 1,792 Afghan police officers have been 
killed since March – twice as many as the same period last year, 
according to the Afghan interior ministry, leading to claims that the country is in no fit state to be left without Western combat troops as they prepare to exit this spring.

US General Joseph Dunford said 'time's 
going to tell' whether it was premature for Nato to end combat 
operations this spring and said the follow-on mission focusing on 'capability development' is likely to last several years.

In reference to the casualty rates, he said: ‘I view it as serious, and so do all the commanders,’ he said. ‘I’m not assuming that those casualties are sustainable.’

Gen Dunford said the 350,000 local security forces struggled with both intelligence-gathering and logistics and needed ‘three to five years’ before they no longer needed help from foreign troops.

By the end of 2014, Afghans are expected to take full responsibility for their security, and all combat Nato troops will leave.  In August President Obama promised this would signal 'the end of our war in Afghanistan.'

He said 'close air support' may still be needed to assist Afghan security forces, which are only just beginning to develop their own aviation capacity.

Dunford insisted that troops had been 
successful in 'defying the Taliban' and 'preventing them from achieving 
their goals' to crush the government's will.

He said a Bilateral Security Agreement (BSA) now needs to be signed within months.

It will reassure both Afghans and their neighbours of U.S. commitment to the country, he said.

General Joseph Dunford, the top US and Nato commander in the country, said that casualty rates were 'serious' in an interview

It
comes after former NATO supreme commander Admiral James Stavridis last 
month said the United States and its allies should confirm  how many 
troops will stay on in Afghanistan after 2014.

He said it should be clarified in order to combat Taliban propaganda that foreign troops are 'abandoning the country'.

Stavridis said in a commentary in Foreign Policy: 'Instead of waiting for months, we should move now to decide and publicly reveal the commitment.'

Currently there are approximately 100,000 troops in Afghanistan in the NATO-led coalition.

American forces account for around two-thirds of the number.

The White House has in the past suggested a small force of between 8,000 to 12,000 troops will remain in the country after 2014 in a support role.

But after a 'difficult' negotiation period with Kabul, officials have since spoken of removing all troops.
