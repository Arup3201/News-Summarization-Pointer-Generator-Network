Greek MPs finally approved key austerity measures yesterday as dozens of police and protesters were injured on a second day of bloody riots in Athens.

Police fought running battles with demonstrators who were armed with petrol bombs, bricks and sticks. Officers responded by firing tear gas which filled the air in Syntagma Square, outside the parliament.

Fighting continued into the night as public anger at the package to cut spending and raise taxes by £25billion over five years boiled over into the worst violence yet. Protesters stormed the ground floor of the nearby finance ministry, set fire to a post office and ripped up pavements.

One MP who promised to vote against 
the package but then voted for it was attacked with stones as he left 
parliament. The vote was narrowly passed by 155 votes to 138.

A vote on reforming laws to allow the
package to be implemented is due today to ensure the country receives 
the next batch of bailout loans from the EU and international creditors.
Last night the EU said Greece should receive £10billion within weeks.

The bill comes after a year of deep 
cuts that have seen public sector salaries and pensions cut. 
Unemployment has risen to more than 16 per cent, and 40 per cent among 
the young, as Greece faces defaulting on its huge debt. In Britain, a 
ComRes/ITV News poll yesterday found a majority of the UK public say the
crisis ‘is nothing to do with Britain and we have no duty to 
intervene’.

Fifty four per cent also said that Greece should not receive
any more EU money.

Flames of anger: Demonstrators in Syntagma Square today are determined to block access to politicians

Surge: Thousands of protesters march on the Greek Parliament building on the second day of a 48-hour general strike

Crisis: Greek people are angry at swingeing cuts and tax hikes aimed at stabilising the economy and avoiding defaulting on a 110billion euro bail out from last year

Greek prime minister George 
Papandreou said before yesterday’s vote: ‘We must avoid the country’s 
collapse with every effort. Outside, many are protesting. Some are truly
suffering, others are losing their privileges. But they must never 
suffer the consequences and for their families of a collapse.’

The passage of the bill was met with a
huge sigh of relief by the markets and Greece’s partners in the 
eurozone. A Greek default could potentially trigger a banking crisis, 
particularly in Europe, and turmoil in global markets.

EU leaders hailed the vote as an act 
of ‘national responsibility’ and urged Greek lawmakers to follow up with
another positive vote today. In a joint statement, the heads of the EU 
commission and council, Jose Manuel Barroso and Herman Van Rompuy, said 
Greece had taken ‘a vital step back – from the very grave scenario of 
default’.

They said the vote would ‘restore 
hope to the Greek people’. But many of those people disagreed. Dimitris 
Kostopoulos, a 48-year-old insurer, said: ‘This is bad, the country will
be sold for a piece of bread. There were many other more appropriate 
alternatives to this. Parliament has once again betrayed us.’

Discontent: Tens of thousands of protesters were expected to flood streets in Athens today over deeply unpopular austerity measures

Stop: An anti-austerity protester stops a car from getting through to Syntagma Square

Pitched battle: Protestors clash with riot police during the 48-hour general strike

Battering: A protester falls to the ground after being hit by police

Hurt: A bleeding protester is treated following clashes with the police today

Authorities and emergency services 
said 31 police and 15 protesters were injured and transferred to 
hospitals. Volunteer doctors said they had treated about 40 people, most
with facial injuries and breathing problems, at a makeshift treatment 
site at a metro station next to parliament.

At one point, riot police  outside 
the finance ministry ran out of tear gas and began hurling massive 
chunks of marble at demonstrators.

Police were also seen attacking peaceful demonstrators who had been camped in front of parliament for several weeks.

They cornered a large group and beat them with batons.

A luxury hotel across from parliament was evacuated, forcing tourists to seek shelter elsewhere.

Greece has been in the grip of a 
48-hour strike which has crippled much of Athens as people protest 
against the measures which will hit many of the lowest-paid workers.
