Rarely has a team held such dominance over a division.

A week barely goes by without Bayern Munich setting some new record or another and it's fairly safe to assume that the Bundesliga's 'Winter champions' will still be on top in May as well.

Pep Guardiola's team recorded a perfunctory 2-0 win over Freiburg on Tuesday night, with goals from Arjen Robben and Thomas Muller, and barely broke sweat.

Pep Guardiola's side are well on course for another Bundesliga triumph in the new year

It means they have taken 42 points from a possible 48 so far and enjoy a 12-point advantage over Wolfsburg, who can restore that to nine on Wednesday evening.

Bayern head to Mainz on Friday and then aren't in competitive action again until January 31, such is the generous German winter break, but as first halves to the season go, this one hasn't been bad.

Most remarkable is Bayern's frugal defence. They have let in just three goals so far, a new Bundesliga best.

It was one-way traffic at the Allianz Arena on Tuesday, with the hosts firing in 31 shots on goal - a season high - and they didn't allow Freiburg a sniff of goal until the 75th minute.

Indeed, Manuel Neuer was more of a sweeper keeper than ever, spending much of the match roaming around in midfield as Bayern produced wave-after-wave of attack.

Bayern's lead at the top of the Bundesliga table stands at 12 points with one game to play before the break

Robben's goal was his 100th in competitive matches for the club in just 184 appearances and to cap his night, he was presented with the Dutch Sportsman of the Year Award.

The evening also saw Rafinha claim a new record. With the right-back in their team, Bayern have not conceded a goal in 1,106 minutes - a new Bundesliga record.

The previous best was their former player Michael Ballack, who clocked 1,099 minutes in the team without them conceding during the 2002-03 season.

Guardiola's death-by-passing approach is well refined but seems to be reaching even greater heights with Bayern. They have completed an average of 612.6 passes per game this season, more than any other side in Europe's top five leagues.

Xabi Alonso, meanwhile, has completed 1,320 passes so far this season, more than anyone else playing in England, Spain, France, Germany and Italy.

So what records can be broken in the second half of the season? If Bayern beat Mainz, they will enter the winter break with 45 points, two less than their tally at this stage last season.

But they can still surpass their own record from 2012-13 of total number of points in a season overall. They gained 91 that season and can still hit 96 this, though they'd have to win every game after Christmas.

On the evidence of the season so far, however, you wouldn't put it past Bayern to win the lot.
