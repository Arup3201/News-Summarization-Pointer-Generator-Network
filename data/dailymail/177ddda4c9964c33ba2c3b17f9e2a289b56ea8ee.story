Paul Walker's ex and best friend has said she's devastated about losing the 'Fast & Furious' star just five days after her father passed away from cancer.

'These were the two loves of my life and the most important men in my life,' model-turned Las Vegas real estate broker Aubrianna Atwell said Sunday.

Atwell met Walker through friends at the Hollywood Canteen a dozen years ago. The two began dating and though the romance ended, they have been in each other's lives ever since, chatting on the phone at least every week. Walker had promised to be with Atwell at her father's memorial service December 8.

But on Saturday, as she toasted her father's memory with friends, she received a text message from Walker's friend.

'Call me please,' it read.

'In my gut, I knew something was wrong,' the 28-year-old told the Las Vegas Review-Journal.

When she called, she was asked 'Are you driving?'

The news left her crushed.

Atwell's father, prominent real estate broker David Atwell, died last Monday of complications associated with his throat and lung cancer. He was 63 and had recently penned an email to Walker, thanking him for the supportive role he held in his daughter's life.

'My dad told him how much he loved him and how much he appreciated him protecting me,' she told the Las Vegas Sun. 'It was an overdue expression of gratitude.'

The pair had 'traveled the world together,' Atwell said, explaining she regularly accompanied him on international trips.

For
 her birthday in April, the 40-year-old actor took her to San Francisco 
to see a Giants game. She said she rushed home to be by her dad's side 
for his last months.

'Paul was going to be with me on the day of my dad's service,' Atwell told The Sun.

'He
 was the most generous, unconditionally loving person I've known. He 
gave everything. I will live my life to the fullest extent for my father
 and Paul.'

Atwell said she and Walker talked a lot about his 15-year-old daughter Meadow who 'was everything to him.'

Walker had been at a charity event on 
behalf of his organization Reach Out Worldwide, helping victims of 
Typhoon Haiyan. He left Meadow at the event as he went on what was 
intended to be a quick ride with a friend.

'My heart is aching for Meadow. Paul was so committed to her,' Atwell told the Review-Journal. 'That's what's so hard about this. All he wanted to do was protect his daughter.'

But his other love was perhaps what killed him.

Walker was 'a huge exotic car enthusiast and not just because of the "Fast & Furious" influence,' Atwell said.

'He raced all over the world.'

Porsches, like the one he ultimately died in, were his favorite, she explained, adding 'I'm sure a bit of speed was involved.'

Atwell's heartbreaking words come as Walker's girlfriend, Jasmine Pilchard-Gosnell, 23, is being comforted by her mother Julie following the devastating accident.

She
 has reportedly been dating Walker since 2006 when she was just 16 and 
he was 33 - but the 17-year age gap has been no barrier to them both 
finding love.

Jasmine's uncle Barton Bruner told MailOnline Sunday: 'Paul was a really good guy and Jasmine is broken up by this. I went to 
Thanksgiving with him, played golf with him.

'They had their ups and downs but they were together and looking to spend a bright future together.

'This is horrible news and unexpected. Her mother is with her and she is comforting her.'

Jasmine,
 a college student who lives in Santa Barbara, California, was 
supposedly beginning to become the step-mother to Walker's daughter 
Meadow  even though she is only eight years older than her.

Jasmine's
 presence in Walker's life may have been one of the reasons why Meadow 
decided to move in with him earlier this year, having spent her entire 
childhood with her mother Rebecca Soteros who lives in Hawaii.

Meanwhile, a fake Facebook page purporting to belong to Meadow Walker has been shut down.

Walker's reps contacted Facebook directly. On the page, the imposter paid tribute to Walker, calling him her 'real life hero'.

The teenager has not been seen since her terrible loss on Saturday.

Walker was raised a Mormon in a working class California family, but his good looks - he was once described as a 'young Steve McQueen' - meant he was never lacking female attention.

He also strayed from the family values his parents instilled in him and when he was 18 faced a felony charge though he has never revealed what it was. The case was reduced to a misdemeanor.

When Rebecca got pregnant Walker was 25 but he refused to marry her, claiming that he was not mature enough even though it left him feeling like an 'evil SOB.'

Walker met his girlfriend, Jasmine Pilchard-Gosnell, when he was 33 and she was just 16

In one interview Walker said: 'I knew
 where I was at with chicks and having fun. I mean, I was sleeping with 
her (Rebecca's) friends, for crying out loud. You know what I mean?

'I was an animal, and so I want to be there and my heart wants to be in it, but the mind just isn't following it.'

Walker shared custody of Meadow and has claimed that things were good between him and Rebecca.

He has said: 'I love my daughter so much, and I love her mom too. We get along so well as a result of me playing it the way that I did.'

Walker had spent Thanksgiving with Meadow and friends and was scheduled to return to Atlanta to continue filming the seventh Fast and the Furious film when he died.
