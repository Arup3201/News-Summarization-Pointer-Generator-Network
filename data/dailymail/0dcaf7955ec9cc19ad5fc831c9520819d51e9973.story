London’s estate agents earned an astonishing £1.1billion in fees last year - up 23 per cent on the figure in 2013, a study revealed today.

Sellers in the capital paid £9,384 on average in agent fees on each property sale in 2014 - with the largest amount earned by estate agents being the £73million in Kensington & Chelsea.

This was up 16 per cent on the previous year, while the figure in second-placed Westminster was up 14 per cent to £70million, according to research by online estate agents HouseSimple.

The biggest percentage rise in fees was observed in the home of the 2012 Olympics in Newham, up 55 per cent to £18million, while neighbouring Waltham Forest was up 49 per cent to £24million.

Also performing well for estate agents were Greenwich, Barking & Dagenham and Tower Hamlets - up 50 per cent to £31million, 45 per cent to £12million and 42 per cent to £50million respectively.

The figures were revealed as the ONS reported today that UK house prices climbed 10 per cent in 2014 to take the average to £272,000 - including a 13 per cent rise in London to £502,000,

Alex Gosling, chief executive of HouseSimple, said: ‘After their performance last year, you’d be hard pressed to find a high street estate agent without a Cheshire Cat-sized grin on their face.’

He told MailOnline: ‘Properties in desirable London boroughs were practically selling themselves, and yet high street agents stubbornly kept their fee levels high.

‘Many sellers were probably asking the same question: “Why am I paying tens of thousands of pounds in fees to you when the first person to view made an offer which I accepted?”’

He claimed that 2 per cent of home sales are currently done through online estate agents - but if 20 per cent of people had used them last year they would have saved £210million in fees.

HouseSimple was founded by Mr Gosling and his wife Sophie in 2007, and it claims to have sold or let £1billion worth of property and saved UK homeowners a total of £13million in fees.
