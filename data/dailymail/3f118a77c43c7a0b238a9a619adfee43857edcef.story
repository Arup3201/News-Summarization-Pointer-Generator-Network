The flight of a blind Chinese activist to the US Embassy has sparked a diplomatic standoff between American diplomats and Chinese officials, who suspect Washington is trying to undermine the Communist government.

The flight of Chen Guangcheng, a campaigner for disabled rights and victims of forced abortions, is a challenge for China's authoritarian government and, if it's confirmed he is in U.S. custody, for Washington too.

Assistant Secretary of State Kurt Campbell began a hurried mission to Beijing on Sunday to smooth the way for annual talks involving his boss, Hillary Clinton, Treasury Secretary Timothy Geithner and scores of officials.

Concerns: Fears are growing for He Peirong, left, who has been detained for her involvement in the plot to free Chen Guangcheng, from house arrest

Chen's whereabouts have yet to be 
confirmed. Activists in China and overseas have said Chen is either 
under U.S. protection or in the U.S. Embassy.

Chen's escape comes as the Chinese 
leadership is already reeling, trying to heal divisions over the ousting
of a powerful politician, Bo Xilai, and complete a once-a-decade 
transition to a new generation of leaders.

As in Chen's case, the U.S. is 
implicated: Bo's ouster was precipitated by the sudden flight of an aide
to the U.S. Consulate in Chengdu.

While the aide, Wang Lijun, gave 
himself up to Chinese authorities the incident and Chen's escape 
reaffirm long-held suspicions by Beijing that the U.S. wants to undermine 
the communist government.

Late last week, the White House, in a
reversal, said it was considering selling new warplanes to Taiwan – the
democratic island China claims as a breakaway territory.

It's not known what Chen's intentions
are: some say he wants to stay in China. But negotiating any exit from 
US custody is likely to be difficult for the Obama administration. 
Beijing is likely to be wary of any concessions, fearing they might 
embolden other activists.

Without confirming if Chen is in U.S. 
hands, Obama's counterterrorism adviser John Brennan said the president 
would work to further human rights while preserving ties with Beijing.

'I think in all instances the 
president tries to balance our commitment to human rights, making sure 
that the people throughout the world have the ability to express 
themselves freely and openly, but also that we can continue to carry out
our relationships with key countries overseas,' Brennan said on the US 
television news show Fox News Sunday.

Complicating any negotiations over 
Chen is the treatment of his family. While Chen escaped a week ago from 
Dongshigu village and made it 370 miles northwest to Beijing, his wife 
and 6-year-old daughter were left behind. The whereabouts of several 
other relatives, including Chen's mother and brother, are unknown.

Though Chen – a self-taught legal 
activist described by friends and supporters as calm and charismatic – 
hardly seems a threat, security forces and officials have reacted 
angrily, detaining several of his supporters and a nephew who fought 
with officials after the escape was discovered is on the run.

Retribution: Several members of Chen's family are believed to have been detained following his escape

Police showed up at the home of 
veteran activists Zeng Jinyan and Hu Jia, who met with Chen last week 
while he was hiding in Beijing. Police took Hu away Saturday for 24 
hours. They questioned Zeng for about a half-hour at home, sounding, she
said, 'very unhappy' about Chen's flight.

'They were really irritated,' Zeng said. 'It was a big shock for them.'

Concern is growing for the safety of a
courageous Chinese activist who was detained after helping a blind 
dissident escape house arrest.

Human rights campaigners believe He Peirong was arrested for her involvement in the plot which freed legal activist Guangcheng, 40, who had been in captivity for almost six years.

He Peirong, from Nanjing, had been at the forefront of the campaign to free Chen, a self-taught 'barefoot lawyer' who was jailed for four years and then held for 19 months under heavy guard after exposing forced abortions as part of China's one-child policy.

She claimed she had driven Chen to a 'relatively safe place' after he dodged more than 100 guards and broke loose from Dongshigu village, in China's Shangdong province, southeast of Beijing.

Chen was then driven 350 miles through the countryside to the U.S. Embassy.

Secret meeting: Blind legal activist Chen Guangcheng has spoken to fellow Chinese dissident Hu Jia at an undisclosed location in Beijing

Bob Fu, of Texas-based human rights group China Aid, is reported to have spoken to He Peirong on Friday, but she hung up when she told him 'public security' was at the door.

Friends have been unable to contact her since then and her phone was switched off on Friday evening.

Police in Nanjing said they knew nothing of the case.

High-level talks: The top U.S. diplomat for East Asia, Kurt Campbell arrived at a hotel in Beijing to discuss the case

One user on Sina's microblog service compared He Peirong to Spider-Man 'bravely going to dangerous places'.

The message continued: 'She has been beaten and insulted in [Dongshigu].

'She keeps her faith and courage.'

Activists
now fear for the safety of Chen's wife, Yuan Weijing, his six-year-old 
daughter, his elderly mother and other family members who they believe 
have been rounded up in retribution.

HIs nephew, Chen Kegu, was said to be in hiding after using a kitchen knife to defend his mother from intruders.

Another activist, Gao Yushan, is also believed to have been detained.

Li
Fangping, a rights lawyer who tried to represent Chen in his court 
case, told Associated Press that state security had questioned him on 
Friday.

Sophie Richardson, of Human Rights Watch, said: 'It has been extraordinary – this is high stakes stuff.

'None of these people will have gone into it without a pretty clear idea of what might happen to them as a result.

'That shows extraordinary courage on 
the part of activists who are extremely vulnerable to exactly these 
kinds of reprisals … In my view, the least other governments can do is 
stand with them.'

The U.S. 
has declined to comment on Chen's whereabouts, but a photograph has 
emerged of him meeting fellow Chinese dissident Hu Jia at an undisclosed
location in Beijing.

China Aid has issued a statement claiming it 
'learned from a source close to the Chen Guangcheng situation that Chen 
is under U.S. protection'.

The group said 'high-level talks' were under way 
between U.S. and Chinese officials regarding Chen's 'status'.

Anger: The activist's detention for exposing forced abortions in China caused international outcry

The
claims could overshadow a two-day meeting with top Obama administration
officials, including Secretary of State Hillary Clinton, in Beijing 
from Thursday, and ignite new tensions between the two governments.

The top U.S. diplomat for East Asia, Kurt Campbell was seen arriving at a hotel in Beijing, to discuss the case.

Mr Fu said: 'Because
of Chen's wide popularity, the Obama Administration must stand firmly 
with him or risk losing credibility as a defender of freedom and the 
rule of law.'

The
reports of Chen's escape come nearly three months after a Chinese 
official Wang Lijun fled into a U.S. consulate for over 24 hours on 
February 6, unleashing a scandal that has rattled the ruling Communist 
Party months before a once-in-a-decade leadership handover.

Wang's brief flight to the U.S. 
consulate led to the downfall of top official Bo Xilai who had been 
openly campaigning for a place in the inner circle of power in Beijing.

Surrounded: Visitors trying to see Chen Guangcheng, including Christian Bale, have been forcibly removed from the village by over-zealous Chinese guards

Pu Zhiqiang, a Beijing lawyer and 
rights advocate, said reliable contacts also told him Chen took refuge 
in U.S. embassy grounds.

He said: 'Everyone knew about the 
suffering of Chen Guangcheng and his family but nobody dared raised his 
head over this and ignored it.

'Chen Guangcheng has been the most 
typical victim of this lawless, boundless exercise of power. But the day
has finally come when he has escaped from it.'

Chen angered authorities in 2005 by 
exposing forced abortion in his own village and others nearby as part of
China's one-child policy.

He
was jailed soon after on a charge of 'blocking traffic' and damaging 
property in a protest, and has been held under house arrested ever since
his release in September 2010.

Lawyers and activists attempted to 
visit Chen in him home ever since have been forcibly denied entry to his
village by guards, while the man himself compared his own home to a 
'prison' due to his plight.

It
is thought the Chinese authorities had no legal grounds for detaining 
him, and guards even scuffled with Hollywood star Christian Bale when 
the Batman actor tried to visit Chen in his home.
