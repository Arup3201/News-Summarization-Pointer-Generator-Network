A man allegedly hurled an innocent Chihuahua at a glass Starbucks window in Texas on Tuesday night.

Larry McHale was arrested outside of a Starbucks on animal cruelty charges after customers say they saw him nearly kill the Chihuahua at 9:30 p.m.

It's unknown as to whether the poor dog belonged to him or not but animal rescue workers have promised to find the dog, now named Starbucks, a loving home. 

Animal Cruelty: Larry McHale was arrested for animal cruelty after he allegedly threw an innocent dog against a window of the Starbucks in Texas where he's been banned for three months

Nearly died: The dog suffers from a broken back and legs and will need plates and pins to heal the wounds

'It was so loud, the window sounded like it was going to break,' said Starbucks manager Jasmine Hyder to WTSP.

'He's like, you don't care about humans. You only care about a dog,'she recounted.

Hyder said that McHale has been banned from that Starbucks location for three months.

It's not specified as to why Hyder threw the innocent pup at the window but Hyder says she thinks McHale has anger issues.

'He harasses customers every time. He comes in and starts chaos,' said Hyder.

Loving home: Animal rescue workers have made it their goal to find the Chihuahua, now named Starbucks, a loving new home free of abusive people 

Banned: Larry McHale was barred from this Houston Starbucks for three months before the incident occurred

'It's an innocent dog, and you sabotaged the dog's life for no reason,' added Hyder.

The dog survived but needs to heal before it is placed in a loving home.

Nela Brown of Frisky Paws rescue is caring for the dog while while it recovers.

The dog suffers from a broken back and legs and will need plates and pins to fix it.

The surgery is supposed to cost $1,000.

Brown say the dog is lucky to be alive.

'How in the world can someone take such a tiny animal and use it to vent their anger,' asked Brown.

Brown decided the name the dog Starbucks after the horrific incident.

Anyone wishing to donate to Starbuck's healing can do so at Frsky Paws Rescue.
