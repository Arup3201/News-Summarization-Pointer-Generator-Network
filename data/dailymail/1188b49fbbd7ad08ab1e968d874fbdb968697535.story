David Cameron yesterday batted away Tory demands to help middle class families despite increasing pressure to help the 1.4million extra earners dragged into the 40p tax trap since he came to power.

There are growing calls for ministers to help middle earners in next week’s budget, thousands of whom have been dragged into paying the 40p rate of tax over the past three years.

It is thought the number of higher rate taxpayers could hit nearly five million by next year’s election.

Prime Minister David Cameron, on a visit to the Israeli parliament, played down expectations that he could act to help those caught in the 40p tax band

By freezing or lowering the 40p tax rate, the number of earners caught in the bracket has risen to 4.4million under the coalition

Yesterday a leading Labour peer, Lord McFall, joined the growing furore over a tax which is being paid by people who do not consider themselves wealthy.

Lord McFall, the former chairman of the influential Treasury Select Committee, said nearly one in six taxpayers are paying higher rate tax. In 1978, it was just one in 33.

He said: ‘I think that that is a big issue. [It is] taxation by stealth - people don’t realise what that is.’

In May 2010, the month that the coalition Government was formed, a worker became a higher rate taxpayer when their salary hit £43,875.

But George Osborne has repeatedly lowered, or frozen, the salary level at which a worker starts to pay tax at 40 per cent. Today you are a higher rate taxpayer if you are paid £41,450.

To make matters worse, the ‘starting salary’ will barely rise for the next two years, increasing by just one per cent a year to £41,865 next month and £42,285 in April 2015.

Traditionally, it would be increased at a far more generous rate, rising in line with the retail prices index measure of inflation, but the Chancellor scrapped this plan.

Speaking in Israel, Mr Cameron said the coalition was focusing on increasing the personal tax allowance

poor should not be at the expense of the middle classes while Tory MP 
Nadhim Zahawi backed the idea of scrapping the 40p rate altogether

The national minimum wage is to increase by 19p an hour to £6.50 later this year, giving more than a million workers a pay rise.

The rate for 18 to 20-year-olds will go up by 10p to £5.13 an hour - a 2 per cent increase.

For 16 and 17-year-olds the statutory rate will rise by 7p to GBP3.79, also 2 per cent.

The minimum wage for apprentices will go up by 5p to £2.73 an hour, with all the new rates coming into force in October.

The
 Government said it had accepted recommendations from the low Pay 
Commission, including plans for bigger increases in future than in 
recent years.

Business
 Secretary Vince Cable said: 'The recommendations I have accepted today 
mean that low-paid workers will enjoy the biggest cash increase in their
 take home pay since 2008.

'This
 will benefit over one million workers on national minimum wage and 
marks the start of a welcome new phase in minimum wage policy.'

Senior Tories are demanding a big increase in the salary threshold at which people start to pay the 40p rate to around £44,000.

But Mr Cameron repeatedly brushed aside concerns about the impact of so-called ‘fiscal drag’ yesterday when asked about the growing political controversy.

Speaking on a trip to Israel, he said: ‘I am a tax-cutting Conservative - I want to see us relieve people’s tax burden.

‘We have chosen to do that through raising the personal allowance, which helps everyone earning under £100,000.’

Nadhim Zahawi, a Tory MP and a member of the Number 10 policy unit, said: ‘It is right that if there is any money in the kitty, it should go towards those at the lower end of the pay spectrum.’

But he showed his support for a radical proposal from Renewal, a campaign group aiming to broaden the appeal of the Conservative party, to abolish the 40p tax rate.

Under its proposals, the 40p tax rate would be scrapped and the 45p tax rate, which is currently paid by people earning more than £150,000, would be lowered to £62,000.

David Skelton, a director of Renewal, said: ‘George Osborne should take a major step to unwind the undesirable drift towards an ever higher proportion of the working population paying higher rate tax.

‘In doing so, he could relieve the pressure on the squeezed middle, so many of whom have borne the burden of paying for Labour’s profligacy.’

Speaking at Policy Exchange, David Cameron’s favourite think-tank, Mr Zahawi said: ‘We need our iconic tax policy.

‘I think Dave Skelton’s contribution and his suggestion that we abolish the 40p rate and pay for it by lowering the 45p threshold was a great way of starting the conversation.’ 

But Mr Cameron’s comments will dismay senior Tories pushing for the 40p threshold to be raised to ease the pain on higher earners, particularly in the South East where high housing costs eat into disposable income.

Increases in the threshold at which workers start paying tax mean the number of basic rate taxpayers has fallen by almost 3million since 2010

Of the 4.4million higher rate taxpayers, 834,000 live in the South East followed by 817,000 in London, according to figures from HM Revenue and Customs.

John Redwood, the former Tory cabinet minister, said there is now a clear case for helping those on ordinary incomes dragged into the 40p rate.

He said: ‘It is affecting not just those at the threshold limit, who find that a pay rise disappears, but people further down the income scale with aspirations.

‘We need lower taxes across the board.’

Dominic Raab, a leading Tory MP, said: ‘It is right to ease the tax burden on the lowest paid, but that should not be done at the expense of the middle classes.

‘You should not be robbing middle class Peter to pay for working class Paul. We need to cut taxes across the board.’
