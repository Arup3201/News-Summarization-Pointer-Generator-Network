College co-eds sick of ramen noodles descended on the Yotel in Manhattan Friday night to find their definition of Prince Charming - an older man with cash to burn.

'The Sugar Affair' masquerade ball was organized by website Seeking Arrangement, which matches rich older men with much-younger women for 'mutually beneficial relationships'.

Seeking Arrangement CEO Brandon Wade was at the event Friday and told the New York Post that it was organized right around graduation time, since a lot of the female attendants would now face repaying their student loans.

A certain kind of romance: Dating website Seeking Arrangement held a masquerade ball for sugar daddies to meet younger women in Manhattan last Friday. Above, a picture from the event posted to the site's Facebook page

'This is almost like a job fair, because a sugar daddy is a mentor, provider and gentleman,' Wade said. 'Why not date someone who can help you?'

Wade added that most so-called 'sugar babies' get $3,000 a month from their sugar daddy, allowing them to live a luxury lifestyle.

One sugar baby from Nashville traveled to the ball with her 59-year-old sugar daddy who is battling terminal cancer. She says he pays $4,000 a month for her and her sister's living expenses.

A 22-year-old Pace University student says she gets paid $400 to $800 every time she sees one 40-something man and that she's only ever kissed him.

A junior at NYU hooked up with a widower from Chicago at the event.

'I have a fancier lifestyle,' the undergrad said. 'I'm not going to downgrade to some NYU boy who buys dollar beers.'

Into the night, the sugar daddies began openly fondling the women, the Post reported.

Since Seeking Arrangement was started in 2006, it has grown to a community of 2.7million members.

At the start, one in four of the site's female members were in college but now that statistic has changed to one in two.

Sugar babies had to pay $75 to get into the event on Friday, compared to the $150 admission for men.

Sugar daddies had the option of paying more for access to the VIP room filled with 'hand-picked college beauties' who are both 'smart and seductive'.Â
