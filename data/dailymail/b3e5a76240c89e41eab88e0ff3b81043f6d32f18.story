A motorcycle racer captured the moment he was involved in a crash that left a wall of flames licking across the street where the event was being held.

The helmet camera-wearing rider filmed the moment a rival lost control of his bike ahead, knocking him off his own machine and causing an explosion.

The dramatic smash up happened during the final lap of an F3 category race one of the Greymouth Street Race event on New Zealand's South Island.

The footage, which shows the hair-raising scenes from a rider's perspective, shows a racer ahead lose control of his Ducati motorcycle as he oversteers while trying to take a corner too fast.

The competitor tumbles across tarmac as he is thrown clear of the bike, but the machine itself slides across the middle of the road, right into the path of headcam-wearing rider.

The rider in pursuit has no chance of avoiding the collision. He slams into the bike, splitting open its fuel tank which pours petrol all over the road.

As the dazed rider gets up and looks back at the scene of the crash, the road is covered in flames and thick black smoke.

Safety barriers on the side of the road and shops lining the street also appear to be ablaze.

The annual Greymouth Street Race, which is now in its 23rd year, invites motorcycle enthusiasts to race around Greymouth's central business district in a number of different race classes.

It promises spectators and participans a day 'full of great racing and the occasional spill'.

The twisty 0.8-mile circuit has full pedestrian access throughout the event - making it a miracle that bystanders were not hurt in the accident.

Both riders are thought to have walked away from the crash with only minor injuries.
