Former Maldivian president Mohamed Nasheed has urged his supporters to topple the current government

Former Maldivian President Mohamed Nasheed called on his supporters and the army to topple the government ahead of the release of a report on Thursday into this year's transfer of power on the Indian Ocean islands that Nasheed labelled a coup.

The Commonwealth-backed Commission of National Inquiry was appointed to look into the circumstances that led to the crisis in the tropical resort group of islands on February 7 when Nasheed said he was asked to resign at gunpoint. Nasheed's supporters said the report would be biased against them.

Speaking to thousands of supporters late on Wednesday in the capital Male, where members of his former ruling Maldivian Democratic Party (MDP) had gathered, Nasheed called on the public, the army and police to take to the streets.

'If the Commission report declares it was not a coup, then it is legitimate for the people to topple the government from the street,' Nasheed said.

The government has tightened security in Male, fearing unrest. Police have said they would not allow any disturbance and asked people to stay away from planned protests.

Nasheed's MDP nominee on the commission resigned from the panel on Wednesday after saying some evidence likely to support Nasheed's allegations of a coup was missing from the report.

The Maldives, for almost nine centuries a sultanate before it became a British protectorate, held its first fully democratic elections in 2008.

Nasheed defeated Maumoon Abdul Gayoom, who at 30 years in power was then Asia's longest-serving leader and accused of running the country as a dictator.

The Maldives hit the headlines in February when its Nasheed was ousted by his deputy, Mohammed Waheed Hassan.

Nasheed had spent six years as a political prisoner before his election in 2008 and his first act as president was to demolish the country’s torture centre.

He was a guest at the 2009 Conservative Party conference in Manchester where he addressed delegates.

Hassan insists that Nasheed ‘resigned’ – but the manner of his removal was widely condemned, with many observers branding it a coup.

Earlier this month, former British Labour Party Cabinet Minister was criticised after agreeing a deal to be paid £7,500 a day to advise the leader of the alleged coup in the Maldives.

According to leaked document, ex-Attorney-General Baroness Scotland was paid £75,000 for two weeks’ work advising the regime on avoiding further action by the Commonwealth, which has raised serious concerns about a string of human rights abuses.

Tory MP John Glen said it was ‘outrageous’ that a former British attorney-general was advising a regime responsible for ousting a democratically-elected president.

He said: ‘What happened in the Maldives was a military coup. She should hang her head in shame.’

Conservative MP Karen Lumley, who worked in the Maldives before being elected to Parliament, said: ‘President Nasheed was overthrown in a coup and the Maldives is now very unstable.

'Many of my friends there have been arrested by the new regime. It is disgusting that a former British attorney-general should take a well-paid job advising the new regime, which has no democratic mandate.’
