The turrets are made from hand-beaten copper and the fleurs-de-lis finials on the roof have been expertly carved from the finest tulipwood.

Clearly no expense has been spared to create this luxury home, designed for a little girl with big dreams – and indulgent parents.

For, the ‘Room for a Princess’ is not your average property. It’s actually a children’s playhouse on sale at Harrods – and at £85,000, it costs the same as a real house elsewhere in the country.

‘Room for a Princess’: A playhouse fit for a little girl with big dreams – and indulgent parents

The Wendy House that costs as much as a a two-bedroom semi-detached house in Blackburn

Currently available for £85,000 is a two-bedroom semi-detached house in Blackburn, a two-bedroom flat in Plymouth and a three-bedroom cottage in south Lanarkshire.

The playhouse is designed as a dressing-up room and has been made by Northamptonshire-based firm The Master Wishmakers. It took a team of six craftsmen ten weeks.

The playhouse’s main structure is tulipwood – a lightweight wood from North America – but the floor is decorated with marquetry, painstakingly put together using American walnut, maple and oak. Inside, there’s a heavy satin curtain with gold braiding.

Harrods says the dressing room has attracted numerous expressions of interest from clients in the Middle East, as well as celebrities and royals, since going on sale a month ago, although it refused to say how many – if any – have actually been sold.

Nino Rosella, of The Master Wishmakers, said: ‘We specialise in the outrageous and the fantastical.

‘Nothing is too unusual for us to take a stab at making – as long as it’s scientifically possible, we’ll build it. And we guarantee never to make the same item more than once.

‘We have built three-storey treehouses which are insulated, with heating, running water and one even had a cinema room.’

The company’s most ambitious project to date is Challis Island, a pirate-themed Caribbean island with a lagoon nestling in a lake within 60 acres of English countryside.
