Ultramarathon burns victim Turia Pitt has agreed a settlement from event organisers Racing The Planet.

The former model, 26, and another runner, Kate Sanderson, suffered burns to more than 60 per cent of their bodies after they became trapped in a bushfire while running an outback marathon in the Kimberley Region of Western Australia in 2011.

The Supreme Court action was settled out of court for an undisclosed sum.

Ms Pitt's boyfriend Michael Hoskin said it got settled through mediation and the couple were glad the process was over.

'You can’t really speak about whether it was a good or great outcome, there's no winners, it’s just an outcome you know, but it’s really good to have that behind us now, so we can move forward,' Mr Hoskin told 60 Minutes for a program to air this Sunday.

'We don’t even have to think about that ever again.'

When asked if she felt that she can now let go, Ms Pitt said 'Yeah I think so yeah'.

She added that psychologically it was a good thing.

'Yeah of course it’s a good thing. I mean I can move on.'

Ms Pitt launched the court action in February last year after a WA parliamentary inquiry found Hong Kong-based Racing The Planet did not take reasonable steps to ensure the safety of competitors.

Ms Pitt's lawyer Greg Walsh said she had shown enormous courage and dignity.

'I'm very relieved and happy for her and (her boyfriend) Michael (Hoskin) that this matter has now come to an end,' Mr Walsh told the West Australian.

'She will be left with horrific injuries for the rest of her life but at least she won't have to put up with the stress and worry of a protracted court case.'

In 2012 Ms Pitt and Ms Sanderson, 38, were awarded $450,000 by the WA government as an 'Act of Grace'.

Western Australia Tourism Minister Dr Kim Hames said that the money was to 'assist in alleviating their financial stress while they explore other options.'

Ms Pitt, who was working in mining engineering when she entered the marathon race, told a 2012 inquiry that she wasn't even planning to enter the event because she thought the entry fee was ridiculous.

But two weeks before the marathon on September 2 2011, she was invited by organisers to compete for free.

She was joined in the event by adventure enthusiast Ms Sanderson and 40 other runners who were destined to run across the parched outback Kimberley region of north west Australia.

But part-way through the race Ms Pitt and Ms Sanderson, along with two male competitors, became trapped by a bushfire in a narrow, rocky gorge.

Ms Pitt's injuries were so bad that not only did she suffer burns to 64 per cent of her body, she also had four fingers from her left hand and her right thumb amputated.

Ms Sanderson had to have her left foot amputated, lost part of her earlobes and part of her right index finger.

They told the inquiry earlier they had no idea they were running into danger because the organisers had spoken only 'in passing' about spot fires.

Ms Pitt said she and Ms Sanderson would have died at the gorge if not for a risky rescue mission undertaken by a helicopter crew.

Joint Media Statement Issued By Turia Pitt and RacingtheplanetThere has been extensive misreporting in the media about the settlement reached between Turia Pitt and RacingThePlanet. Turia Pitt and RacingThePlanet are issuing this joint statement to correct the misreporting. Turia Pitt and RacingThePlanet are pleased that a settlement has been reached and that the parties have avoided a lengthy and uncertain court case. The settlement represents a  commercial outcome that involved both parties making compromises. Contrary to certain media reports, there have been no admissions of liability. Media reports as to the settlement amount are also wildly incorrect. RacingThePlanet deeply regrets the injuries suffered by Ms Pitt but strongly denies that it was in any way liable for them. RacingThePlanet wishes Ms Pitt all the very best for the future. It hopes that the settlement enables her to move on from this tragic event and to continue to make the fantastic progress in her recovery that has been evident to date. Ms Pitt and RacingThePlanet will not be making any further comment in relation to the settlement.RacingThePlanet believes it is clear that the fire that burnt Ms Pitt was deliberately lit and is very concerned that this has not been properly investigated (including by the WA Parliamentary inquiry) nor has the culprit been held to account. RacingThePlanet welcomes recent initiatives by the WA Acting Minister for Tourism to re-open these investigations and is willing to assist in any way it can.
