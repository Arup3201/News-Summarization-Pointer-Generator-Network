PSG striker Zlatan Ibrahimovic has posted a photo of him and Ronaldo, who he has described as 'the best player of all time'.

The Brazilian striker was a guest of former French president Nikolas Sarkozy at PSG's clash with Nice on Saturday.

The Ligue 1 champions won 1-0 courtesy of a first half penalty from their Swedish talisman, and Ronaldo headed down to the changing rooms after the game to congratulate the 33-year-old.

Ibrahimovic then posted a photo of the pair online and wrote: 'This was the best thing that happened last night. The best player of all times, Ronaldo. The Phenomenon.'

The two strikers have followed similar paths in their careers, with both having played for Inter Milan, AC Milan and Barcelona. Both players also rose to prominence while playing in the Eredivisie.

Ibrahimovic isn't known for his modesty but, when it comes to Ronaldo, the former Malmo youth player is more than willing to concede the Brazilian is the better player.

In an interview with Sports illustrated, he said: 'The best opponent of my career? I've played against many, many good players, so I don't know who to keep.

'But I would say Ronaldo, 'El Fenomeno'. Why? Because he was my idol and because, as a football player, he was complete.

'There will never, in my view, be a better player than him.' 

Both players enjoyed hugely successful spells with Serie A club Inter Milan, both then left for La Liga

after returning from spells in La Liga both of the forwards ended up playing for AC Milan

Both played for Spanish giants Barcelona, although the Brazilian will remember his time there more fondly
