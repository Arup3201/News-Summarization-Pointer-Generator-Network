Jailed: Dawn Barr has been sentenced to nine years in prison after she stabbed the father of four of her children to death

A mother-of-six who stabbed the 'devoted' father of their children to death during a blazing row after she left him for another man has been jailed for nine years.

Darren Orrett, 32, had moved out of the family home in Cheadle, Greater Manchester, he shared with care assistant Dawn Barr, 42, after she told him she had started a new relationship with lover Robert Joyce.

Manchester Crown Court heard Mr Orrett, a window fitter, was 'very upset' by the break up of the 12-year relationship and felt Joyce had 'ruined his life'.

Alan Conrad QC, prosecuting, said he 
took it particularly hard because three of the four children he had with
 Barr suffered from cystic fibrosis and he was dedicated to the special 
care they needed.

On 
November 15 last year, he returned to the house after one of his 
daughters called and posted messages on Facebook messages saying she missed
 him.

Alan Conrad QC prosecuting said: 'Darren continued to
 attend at the house - whether to see the children or to try against the
 odds to win back the defendant. But it is plain that the defendant did 
not welcome these visits.

'So too Darren Orrett could not stand
 the thought of Robert Joyce being in his house. As he continued to come
 round emotions were raised on both sides.'

The court heard that after Mr Orrett had tucked his daughter into bed, a row 
broke out between him and Barr over her cheating and he vowed to hide 
her mobile phone so she could not contact her lover. During the war of 
words he was stabbed with a kitchen knife used to cut vegetables.

Murder: Police were called the family home in Cheadle, Greater Manchester, after reports father-of-four Darren Orrett had been stabbed

Police and paramedics alerted by a 999 call from Barr arrived at the house to find Darren bleeding to death on the floor.

Mr Orrett was taken to hospital 
where he died a short time afterwards after the fatal wound severed the 
left jugular vein and penetrated into the left lung.

Reconciliation: Victim Darren Orrett had returned to the family home to try and rekindle the relationship and see his four children

Barr originally told police 
her ex partner stabbed himself in a fit of jealousy. She later admitted she had 
killed him but said it was in self defence during a violent row.

She said Mr Orrett had previously threatened her and Joyce and vowed to
 take custody of the children.

Barr told police: 'I had the knife and I just 
remember it being in his neck and blood coming out. I didn't feel it 
going in.'

The court also heard that Barr had texted Joyce 48 hours before the killing, saying: 'Get him gone - I'm gonna kill this c***. I'll stab the c*** myself.'

Barr was found guilty of manslaughter and jailed for nine years. She was acquitted of murder.

Passing sentence Judge Michael Henshell said: 'The relationship with Robert Joyce which ultimately was the destructive force behind this case, was an entirely selfish relationship which you embarked on with this man.

'It led you to be blind to the fact that Darren Orrett - the man who loved you and was a devoted father - was feeling completely excluded. That led directly to the way he behaved towards you, to your loss of control and led ultimately to his death.'

There was a single cry of 'suffer' from the public gallery as Barr, who showed no emotion, was sent down.

Tragedy: The court heard Mr Orrett had returned to the house to see his daughter after she called and posted messages on Facebook saying she missed her father

Today Senior Investigating Officer Duncan Thorpe from Greater Manchester Police said: 'On the night of his death Darren received a phone call from his eldest daughter asking him to call round because she was missing him.

'Darren visited her and whilst there, an argument started with Barr where the end result was her stabbing him and Darren sadly losing his life.

'This was a needless act, not only leaving a family without a brother and son, but four children and two step-children without a much loved and dedicated father. They will now have to grow up knowing that their mum killed their dad, robbing them of a lifetime love.'
