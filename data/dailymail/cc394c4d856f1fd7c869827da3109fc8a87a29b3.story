Norwegian mass killer Anders Behring Breivik wanted to capture and decapitate former Norwegian Prime Minister Gro Harlem Brundtland during his shooting massacre on Utoya island, he said.

Breivik told his trial he planned to film the beheading and post the video on the internet - as well as kill all 600 people who were at the Labour Party's youth camp on July 22.

But Brundtland had already left the area as the far-right fanatic began his shooting spree.

Brutal: Breivik said he spent up to 16 hours per day playing the violent Call of Duty video game in preparation for the attacks

The revelation came as Breivik described how he became a deadly marksman by honing his gun skills by playing the violent Call Of Duty: Modern Warfare computer game.

The mass killer even bought a special gun sight used on the game - and attached it to the hunting rifle he used for his deadly rampage on a Norwegian island.

Details of Breivik's fixation with computer gaming was revealed after he admitted taking a 'sabbatical' for a year during which he also played the fantasy game World of Warcraft.

In a further insight to Breivik's warped mind he revealed how he gave his hunting rifle, pistol and 'getaway' vehicle names taken from Norse mythology.

The Call Of Duty series, such as the Black Ops game, have often been cited as violent games

Tragic: Breivik also spent hours on the fantasy game World of Warcraft as he set himself up for the massacre

Fictional: Breivik immersed himself in the World of Warcraft so much that prosecutors think he believed he was in a video game during the attack

During cross examination at Oslo District Court the 33-year-old continued to give evidence at a trial where he has admitted killing 77 people in Oslo on July 22, last year.

Breivik killed 8 people in the city's Government district after leaving a 950kg van bomb before driving to Utoya island where he shot and killed 69 mainly young people attending a Labour party summer camp.

Violent video games can alter the brain in just one week and make players more aggressive, researchers say.

An
 Indiana University School of Medicine study found key areas in the 
brain suffer reduced activity and leave it physically altered.

The findings fuelled the debate over the impact violent games have on regular players and links to anti-social behaviour.

They
 also came as a British teacher said children as young as four were 
hitting classmates as they re-enact scenes from violent 18-rated 
computer games.

She 
claimed youngsters were struggling to separate reality from their 
experiences in the virtual world and then copied the scenes at school.

They
 were coming to lessons too tired to learn after staying up late playing
 computer games, and were often leading 'solitary lives'.

Alison
 Sherratt, a reception class teacher at Riddlesden St Mary’s Church of 
England Primary in Keighley, West Yorkshire, outlined her concerns at 
the Association of Teachers and Lecturers conference earlier this month.

She
 said pupils regularly discussed playing games such as the Call Of Duty 
series, set in various war zones, and Grand Theft Auto – where players 
carry out robberies, muggings, killings, drug deals and beat prostitutes
 with baseball bats.

On
 one occasion, she saw pupils throwing themselves from a play car in 
slow motion and pretending blood was spurting out of them.

Her
 warning came after news that 14-year-old Daniel Bartlam killed his 
mother with a claw hammer after watching a wide range of violent video 
games, films and TV storylines.

Breivik was asked about his interest in computer games and revealed that between the Summer of 2006 and December 2007 he took a 'sabbatical' from working and played computer games for around 16 hours a day.

Initially he concentrated on playing the 'World of Warcraft' fantasy game online before turning to more violent forms of computer 'entertainment.'

'Some people take a year off playing golf,' he told the court. 'I wanted to take a year off to play World of Warcraft.It is not violent at all. It's just fantasy. It's a strategy game.

'During that year I played perhaps 16 hours a day and played an entire year. I was just playing and sleeping...it was a dream I had.

'Some people like to play golf, some like to sail, I played WOW. It had nothing to do with 22/7.'

However Breivik then revealed he then turned to playing Call Of Duty and instead of socialising with any friends he had even spent last New Year's Eve on his computer.

The game is described as a 'first person shooter video game' and Breivik admitted by using it he honed his gun and targeting skills.

Months later he would use those same 'skills' to kill 69 innocent people on the island of Utoya.

On the opening day of the trial prosecutors read the names of the dead on Utoya and revealed the gunshot wounds they received.

Most of them had died after taking two or three shots - and sometimes more - directly to the head.

Cross examined about the game Breivik told the court: 'The game teaches about target acquisition and you have to practice within a specific time. It's a war simulator that shows you how to shoot at people. It helps you acquire experience of sights and targeting.

The game uses a 'holographic sight' similar to the one that Breivik attached to his hunting rifle when he stalked his victims on the island with unerring accuracy.

In a chilling admission regarding the efficacy of the controversial computer game he added: ' You could give it your grandmother and she would be able to become a super marksman!'

Breivik also admitted visiting an Oslo pistol club 25 time to hone his handgun shooting skills but said the game was a great help to him.

' I used a similar holographic aiming device (sight) at Utoya and the game is such a good war simulator is so good that it is used by armies all around the World.'

A holographic weapon sight is a non-magnifying gun attachment allowing the user to look through a glass optical window and see his target image superimposed at a distance.

The sight provides a red circle image with a red dot inside the ring identifying the target.

The court had heard earlier that Breivik had no military training having managed to 'dodge' his National Service by claiming he was the sole carer for his ageing mother.

Breivik also told the court how he gave his weapons and 'getaway' vehicle names from Norse mythology - arguing that many soldiers around the world do the same thing.

His hunting rifle was called 'Gungnir' - which means the 'Spear of Odin' - and he had etched the name onto the weapon. His 9mm Glock pistol was similarly marked but took the name of 'Mjolnir' - which means 'Thor's Hammer.'

Finally, the Fiat Duplo van he used to escape Oslo after the bombing and drive to Utoya was given the name 'Sleipnir.'

This refers to the mythological eight legged horse said to belong to Odin - the major Norse God who was also known as the 'Guide of Souls.'

'Etching the names onto weapons is not new,' added Breivik. 'In fact, it is a great European tradition and lots of soldiers do it.'

Later Breivik told how his original plan had been to make three bombs and to target Government offices, the Royal Family and the Labour Party's offices.

However, he had difficulty making more than one bomb so changed his plans.

Breivik also claimed that he planned to capture former Norwegian prime minister Gro Harlem Brundtland, 72, on the island and behead her on camera.

He took a digital camera with him, he said, along with a knife, bayonet and plastic handcuffs, but changed the plan after finding the camera did not have enough battery life.

Breivik also told the court he planned to kill far more than his 69 victims, as he was aware around 564 people were on the island.

He hoped many more would have fled into the water and drowned. ‘My goal was to kill them all,’ he said.

Thomas Hylland Eriksen, a professor of
 social anthropology at the University of Oslo, said such computer games
 could put Breivik in a state of delusion.    

'When
 he went out on Utoya, possibly at some level still believing he was 
still paying a computer game and shooting people in real life,' he said 
away from the court proceedings.

He
 added: 'He does not seem to be very successful at distinguishing 
between the virtual reality of World of Warcraft and other computer 
games and reality.'

Breivik's
 trial, set to last 10 weeks, turns on the question of his sanity and 
thus whether he can be jailed. He has said that an insanity ruling would
 be 'worse than death'.    

Although Breivik has pleaded not guilty,
 he admitted the killings, saying his victims were traitors who 
supported immigration and multiculturalism, threatening Norwegian ethnic
 purity.    

One court-appointed team of psychiatrists concluded he was psychotic, while a second team found him to be of sound mind.     

Yesterday he said he should either be executed or acquitted, calling the prospect of a prison sentence 'pathetic'.

Breivik has insisted he is a commander in a resistance movement but has acknowledged some of his claims were an exaggeration.

He spent much of yesterday defending the claim that it existed at all.    

In
 court, Breivik struggled to defend his claim of being ordained into a 
militant-nationalist group called the Knights Templar in London in 2002 
after preliminary contact in 2001, refusing to answer more than 100 
questions on the topic.      

Today,
 the fourth day of the trial, saw Breivik enter the Oslo district court 
without the clenched-fist salute he had used in previous hearings.

He was reportedly asked to stop the action by the panel of five judges.
