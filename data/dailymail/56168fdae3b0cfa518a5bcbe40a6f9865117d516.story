They have been dressed by some of the world's most famous designers but British models Jacquetta Wheeler, Jasmine Guinness and Jodie Kidd, say when it comes to style, mother knows best.

The trio pose with their parents in a new shoot for Jaeger which celebrates their inherited fashion sense.

Photographed by Josh Olins, the glamorous mothers and their famous daughters pose in the new Autumn/Winter collection from the British brand as it marks its 130th birthday.

Stylish duo: Jodie Kidd and her mother Wendy pose in clothes from Jaeger's new Autumn collection

In a video of the shoot which you can view here, the pairs are asked to describe one another in three words - which provides some amusing and touching answers.

Jodie's mother, Wendy, herself a former model, sums up her daughter as 'challenging, wonderful and lovable', prompting some offence from racing car driver Jodie on the 'challenging' aspect.

Jodie, 35, wears a chic sleeveless knit 
and sleek pencil skirt in pure new wool, while Wendy looks effortlessly 
cool in a double-face coat, wide leg pants and a merino knit.

Role model: Jacquetta Wheeler describes her mother, Tessa Codrington, as 'determined and bossy'

Meanwhile, Jacquetta, 32, makes a rare appearance with her mother, 
Tessa Codrington, herself a renowned photographer.

Tessa wears a long-line coat while Jacquetta is perfectly at ease in soft suede and wool panelled skirt.

Jacquetta is famed for her beauty around the world and is in demand with designers from Burberry to Versace. The characteristic her mother thinks her daughter possesses the most is 'common sense'.

In return, the model says her mother is 'determined and bossy'.

The line-up is completed by Jasmine, 37, who poses with her Irish-born mother Liz Casey, both in 
beautiful black tailoring and a selection of the new season's coats, 
Made in the UK.

Have a laugh together: Jasmine Guinness says her mother Liz Casey is funny and supportive

The pair burst into laughter when Jasmine describes her mother as 'funny, loving and supportive'.

Jaeger say the mother and daughter campaign captures the very essence of the brand, that has at its heart the ethos 'we don't sell clothes, we dress women'.

Colin Henry, Jaeger CEO said: 'We are proud to unveil the three inspirational mother and daughter pairs featured in our Autumn/Winter campaign. Each duo shares an inherited sense of refined style and a love of timeless, quality pieces; truly personifying the spirit of Jaeger through the decades.'

For Autumn 2014, Jaeger have created a refined yet relaxed wardrobe of modern pieces designed for women who are juggling busy lives.

The focus is on timeless style so, for example, their classic camel coat is re-worked in a variety of ways - from a
 generously cut teddy coat to a throw-over-anything double face jacket 
and a wear-forever day coat.
