The suspected ‘house of horrors’ ringleader allegedly told a neighbour she could adopt her two-year-old girl, before she vanished and her other daughter picked up the girl only to never return.

Linda Ann Weston, 51, allegedly held four mentally disabled adults captive in a filthy basement as part of a benefits fraud scheme in Philadelphia, Pennsylvania, that was uncovered last week.

Now Chevelle McGill has told a local newspaper she cared for a girl Weston claimed was her own for a few months in 2008, waiting for her neighbour to file adoption papers, before Weston disappeared.

Weston, her boyfriend Gregory Thomas, 
47, and Eddie Wright, 50, will make their first court appearances in 
Philadelphia on Monday on charges of kidnapping, assault and false 
imprisonment.

Wright is expected to plead not 
guilty, but it is unclear how Weston and Thomas will plead. All three 
had recently moved into the building with Weston's daughter Jean ‘Jane’ 
McIntosh, 32, police said.

McIntosh also faces charges including 
kidnapping, assault and false imprisonment. She is slated to appear in 
court on Wednesday and it is not yet known how she will plead.

A landlord discovered the victims in a
dank boiler room. Police said the disabled adults, who have the mental 
capacity of 10-year-olds, were malnourished and one was chained to a 
boiler.

Investigators are working to discover 
the extent of the scheme after finding more than 50 Social Security 
cards, power of attorney documents and other such forms in McIntosh's 
apartment.

Eight children and four young adults linked to the defendants are also in protective custody.

Meanwhile, Ms McGill told the 
Philadelphia Daily News that she had cared for a two-year-old girl in 
2008 called 'Little L' who she believed was Weston’s, while she waited for her
to file adoption papers.

‘She never wanted to leave us,’ Ms 
McGill told the Philadelphia Daily News. ‘Every time Linda came to get 
her, she'd cry. She never wanted to leave my arms. So Linda asked if 
we'd like to adopt her.’

'We waited and waited, but we never 
saw Little L again. I just want 
to know where she is. I have to know she's all right'

Then Weston’s daughter McIntosh - 
another suspect - turned up soon after to say she was taking the toddler
to a birthday party, Ms McGill said. But she never returned and Ms McGill is very worried 
for the child’s safety.

‘We waited and waited, but we never 
saw Little L again,’ she told the Philadelphia Daily News. ‘I just want 
to know where she is. I have to know she's all right.’

Ms McGill and her husband Robert said Weston 
lived in a house nearby for five months in 2008 with Thomas, eight 
children she said were hers, three Hispanic children and a woman called 
Maxine Lee.

That is the name of the 39-year-old 
woman police in Virginia confirmed they investigated the death of in 
2008, after Weston cleared out of a Norfolk home hours after calling authorities about the death.

The rescue of four starving, 
mentally handicapped people held captive in the filthy basement of the 
building began with a landlord's suspicions about a pair of dog bowls.

'I knocked on the doors and said: "Is 
anyone feeding a pet?'''

Turgut Gozleveli, landlord

Turgut Gozleveli, a retired electrical
contractor who cares for the building, said how on a routine 
inspection, he noticed missing light bulbs in the basement and dog bowls
under a workbench.

His discoveries ultimately led to the 
arrest of four people and the rescue of three men and a woman from the 
cramped basement dungeon in the working class Tacony neighbourhood.

Mr Gozleveli, 71, who speaks with a 
Turkish accent, said he assumed a tenant had stolen the bulbs but was 
mystified by the bowls in the no-pets-allowed apartment building.

'I knocked on the doors and said: "Is 
anyone feeding a pet?''’ he recalled. All of the tenants he spoke to in 
the seven-unit building, once a small neighbourhood cinema, said no.

On Friday, he looked again and the 
bowls were still there. Then he ventured down steps leading to a 
sub-basement housing water heaters and another smaller room holding an 
out-of-use furnace.

'We're going to prepare to prosecute 
this here or, without hyperbole, wherever the prisons are going to be 
the worst. Federal prisons might be too nice'

Police spokesman Ray 
Evers

He unwrapped a chain wrapped around 
the handle of the metal door to the room and opened the door to find two
small barking dogs and piles of blankets on wooden platforms on the 
dirt floor.

He pulled back the edge of a dirty 
quilt to find a man and a woman huddled underneath. There seemed to be 
little else in the room except a urine-filled bucket that served as a 
toilet.

He called police, believing the two were 
squatters. But inside the small room, police found two more men - one in
a ragged sleeping bag and one chained to the rusty furnace.

Weston, 51, Thomas, 47, her McIntosh, 
32, and Wright, 50, allegedly locked up disabled victims Derwin 
McLemire, 41, Herbert Knowles, 40, Tamara Breeden, 29, and Edwin 
Sanabria, 31.

Philadelphia police spokesman Ray 
Evers said last week that he would be happy to 
see the four prosecuted wherever the punishments would be the harshest.

'I've never seen anything like this before on a living person, that kind of cruelty over and over again. No penalty is too harsh to the people that did this, absolutely no penalty'

Police spokesman Ray 
Evers

'We're going to prepare to prosecute 
this here or, without hyperbole, wherever the prisons are going to be 
the worst,’ he said. ‘Federal prisons might be too nice.

‘I've never seen anything like this 
before on a living person, that kind of cruelty over and over again. No 
penalty is too harsh to the people that did this, absolutely no 
penalty.'

Police Commissioner Charles Ramsey 
described a ‘very complicated case’ and a ‘very sad story’. ‘It makes no
sense,’ he said. ‘When you look at the kids, the psychological trauma 
is pretty apparent.’
