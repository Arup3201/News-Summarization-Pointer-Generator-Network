Taxpayers have spent more than £10million to stop Julian Assange avoiding extradition to Sweden.

The suspected rapist remains holed up in the Ecuadorian Embassy in central London more than two-and-a-half years since he claimed asylum there.

The Wikileaks founder faces immediate arrest on a European Arrest Warrant issued by the Swedish authorities if he steps outside the building.

WikiLeaks founder Julian Assange has been at the Ecuadorian embassy in west London since June 2012

British taxpayers have now spent £10m on guarding the embassy in Knightsbridge where Assange is staying

A team of up to three Metropolitan Police officers monitors the property 24 hours a day after ministers insisted the law must be upheld.

The last official estimate for police costs was made in October when it had reached £9million. The figure has since risen by at least £1million.

It equates to around £10,500 for each of the 959 days Assange has been holed up in the building, a stone’s throw from Harrods in Knightsbridge. 

Stephen Greenhalgh, the deputy mayor for policing and crime in London, said: ‘It is an eye-watering amount of money. We do need a diplomatic solution, but ultimately it is the taxpayer who foots the bill.’

Deputy Prime Minister Nick Clegg said: ‘Am I frustrated that taxpayers are picking up the tab around the Ecuadorian Embassy? Yes, sure. 

'Just imagine the frustration of the Swedish government.

‘This is a country with impeccable democratic credentials, with a well-respected judicial system who say that he should go to Sweden to face very serious allegations and charges of rape, which he denies. 

'Of course, the right thing for him to do is to do that and face justice.’

Assange is wanted in Sweden after allegedly sexually assaulting two women in Stockholm in 2010

In August, Assange indicated he would ‘soon’ leave the embassy but yesterday he showed no sign of giving up. 

The 43-year-old Australian also hit out at Sweden, saying: ‘Sweden has imported Guantanamo’s most shameful legal practice – indefinite detention without charge.’

His comments came after the country’s director general of legal affairs, Anders Ronquist, said someone could be held indefinitely until they are charged.

Assange has been granted asylum by the government of Ecuador but cannot travel there because he will be arrested first.

He wants to avoid extradition to Sweden where he is wanted for questioning over claims he assaulted two women in Stockholm, something he denies.

Assange believes that if he goes to Sweden, he will be extradited to the US and questioned over classified documents published by WikiLeaks. 

He has given a series of speeches from the balcony of the building and ‘attended’ conferences around the world by video message.        

October 2006 – Assange sets up WikiLeaks for anonymous whistleblowers. 

April 2010 – WikiLeaks reveals a video called Collateral Murder, showing two US military teams shooting a group of men from Apache helicopters. Among those killed were two Reuters war correspondents.

December 2010 – US vice president Joe Biden dubs Assange a 'terrorist'. He is arrested by British police and later released on bail.

February 2011 – A High Court in London approves Sweden's extradition request.

November 2011 – High Court dismisses Assange's appeal against extradition. He takes it to the UK's Supreme Court.
