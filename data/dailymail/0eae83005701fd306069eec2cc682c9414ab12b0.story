Draped in traditional tartan, the Queen looked in good spirits as she cheered on competitors at the Braemar Gathering in Scotland – the biggest event in the Highland Games calendar.

Clearly amused by the antics, the 88-year-old monarch was pictured giggling and gesturing as she sat alongside her husband and Prince Charles during today’s main events.

As patron of the Games, the Queen joined thousands of spectators to cheer on participants in the tossing of the caber and tug of war contests.

With the independence referendum looming, this could be the last time that the Queen attends the Braemar Games with Scotland still a part of the UK.

Camilla Parker Bowles was noticeably absent from the traditional event, after being spotted relaxing on a boat in Ibiza.

Prime Minister David Cameron, who joined The Queen at the Games in 2011 – following in the footsteps of previous PMs such a Tony Blair, who made three appearances – also missed the day's celebrations. It is thought he was advised that it would not be constitutionally appropriate.

Held at the Princess Royal and Duke of Fife Memorial Park, west of Aberdeen, the Games take place on the first Saturday of every September and attract visitors from around the world.

The Braemar Gathering is held each year just a short distance from Balmoral Castle in Aberdeenshire, where the royals spend their holidays. Traditionally, the royals attend a church service at nearby Crathie Kirk the day after the Games.

It has a long history and dates back more than 200 years in its modern form.

But there have been Gatherings of one sort or another at Braemar since the days of King Malcolm Canmore, nine hundred years ago.  

Queen Victoria first attended the Braemar Gathering in 1848. Since then it has been regularly visited by the reigning monarch and other members of the Royal Family.

Queen Elizabeth chatted happily with her son Prince Charles as they watched the action unfold at the annual celebration of Scottish and Celtic culture and heritage
