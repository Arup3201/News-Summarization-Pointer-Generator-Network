A Labrador retriever missing after surviving a car wreck that killed his owner New Year's Day has been found unharmed. 

Alone and scared, Wall-E, a five-year-old yellow lab, took off that Jan. 1 night after his owner, 49-year-old Anthony Besch, of Illinois, was killed in a car wreck.

Besch fell asleep at the wheel causing his vehicle to go off the road and slam into a guardrail on an  interstate near Alabama, according to FOX 5. Besch, who was not wearing a seat belt, was ejected from the vehicle and pronounced dead at the scene. 

The five-year-old pooch was nowhere to be found when authorities responded to the wreck.

One day after the incident, Besch's family received news of the wreck and his mother began making phone calls to find the missing pooch, AL reports. 

'I've already lost my son; I have to find his dog,' Besch's mother told the owner of an animal rescue group in Tanner. 

Moved by Besch's mother's phone call, Cathy Oakley, the owner of Bark Avenue, a kennel in Tanner, and organizer of Peace, Love, and Animals animal rescue, put out alerts and, within hours, hundreds of people were on watch for the dog, according to AL. 

Animal rescue volunteer Jackie Metcalf was one of several Limestone County residents who tried to help find the missing dog.

Metcalf located Wall-E Friday afternoon, less than one day after he went missing, according to WHNT.

She spotted him in a neighbor's yard. 

The neighbors said they found Wall-E wandering the interstate Thursday night and took him in out of the cold and rain, according to the New York Daily News.

'The people that had him had taken care of him,' Metcalf told WHNT, 'and made him feel at home, so they really did a really good job of taking care of him.'  

The neighbors said they called the phone numbers on Wall-E's collar but all were for Anthony Besch, whose phone was destroyed in the wreck.

Metcalf took Wall-E, named after the 2008 Pixar movie, to Bark Avenue, which is described on its Facebook page as a 'pet resort,' and the dog was checked for injuries, AL reports.

Wall-E was uninjured. 

The dog stayed in the kennel until Besch's family members picked him up after his funeral Saturday. 

Debbie Besch, Anthony's ex-wife, made arrangements for the dog to live with her and her nine-year-old daughter, Arianna, who is Anthony's daughter, according to AL.

Debbie and Anthony divorced in 2013, according to AL, but the two kept in close contact in order to raise Arianna.

'I just appreciate everybody's effort in finding [Wall-E],' Debbie said. 'They made Arianna so happy, and she needed that.'
