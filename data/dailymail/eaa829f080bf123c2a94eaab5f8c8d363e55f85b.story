Accident: Veteran ABC newswoman Barbara Walters fell at inauguration party

Barbara Walters fell last night at an inauguration party and will be unable to contribute to ABC News' coverage of the event, it was revealed today.

Ms Walters only suffered a cut to her head, but has been hospitalized ‘out of an abundance of caution,’ according to ABC News’ spokesperson. 

Because of her injury, the 83-year-old will not contribute to Monday’s second inauguration of President Barack Obama.

The veteran newswoman was in Washington to cover the events and tripped last night on a step at the residence of Britain’s U.S. ambassador, Sir Peter Westmacott, Politico’s Mike Allen first reported.

ABC News spokesman Jeffrey Schneider said that the fall left Walters with a cut on her forehead.

Mr Schneider said today that 'out of an 
abundance of caution,' Ms Walters was taken to a hospital to get the cut
treated and to receive a full examination.

He said Ms Walters is alert 'and telling everyone what to do,' which is 'a very positive sign.'

It's unclear when Ms Walters might be released from the hospital, which ABC hasn't identified.

According to TV Newser, the octogenarian correspondent will not contribute to Monday’s ceremony and could be off the air for several days.

As it stands, Diane Sawyer and George Stephanopoulos will anchor the day’s events for the network.

Ms Walters was TV news' first female superstar, making headlines in 1976 as a network anchor with an unprecedented $1 million annual salary.

During more than three decades at ABC, and before that at NBC, her exclusive interviews with rulers, royalty and entertainers have brought her celebrity status.

In 1997, she created 'The View,' a live weekday talk show that became an unexpected hit.

Ms Walters had heart surgery in May 2010 but returned to active duty on 'The View' that September, declaring, 'I'm fine!'

Even in her ninth decade, Walters continues to keep a busy schedule, including appearances on 'The View,' prime-time interviews and her annual special, '10 Most Fascinating People.'

During last December's special, she asked New Jersey Gov. Chris Christie if he considered himself fit enough to be president someday. (Gov. Christie, although acknowledging he is 'more than a little' overweight, replied he would be up to the job.)
