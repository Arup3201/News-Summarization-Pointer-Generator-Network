The launch of the Apple Watch had the internet’s army of jokers in full flow as they rushed to post pictures of their own version of the gadget.

The real thing syncs with an iPhone to show notifications and can track the wearer’s heart rate – and it’s set to cost $349 when it goes on sale early next year.

But for those who just couldn’t wait until then, or afford the official version, a common theme quickly developed in which a plain old apple was strapped to the user’s wrist.

Following the unveiling of Apple’s smartwatch in California last night, internet jokers rushed to post pictures of their own version of the gadget. These included a red apple carved into a classic wristwatch design with a rounded face (pictured), created by Japanese Twitter user Hiromichi Shoji

But a few more inventive souls were able to take the joke a bit further - either by eating the apple, having it tell the time or, as one more creative type managed, actually carving a watch out of the fruit.

The carved version was created by Japanese Twitter user Hiromichi Shoji, who goes by the username @sinomoritsukasa.

The watch has a completely new user interface, different from the iPhone, and the 'crown' on the Apple Watch is a dial called the 'digital crown.'

Users can turn the crown to zoom in and out on a map, or scroll a list. The crown can also be pressed to take the user to the home screen.

The Glances feature shows information users would like to see, similar to Google Now.

Music can also be controlled on an iPhone through the Apple Watch. 

It understands questions in messages and then offers pre-selected answers, and messages can be dictated to the iPhone.

There is no keyboard on the watch, and messages can only be sent through dictation, or emoji. 

The Apple Watch goes on sale early 2015 and prices will start at $349. 

He carved a red apple into a classic wristwatch design with a rounded face – although Apple’s version was rectangular and less sticky to the touch.

Twitter user @christonation strapped a red apple to his wrist using tape before writing the time in digital format on the ‘face’.

@findwin simply placed an apple on top of his existing watch, while maverick Firanglani on Instagram placed his watch around the apple.

Instagram user Calumdilieto even ate the apple and placed the remains on his watch, making reference to the watch’s ‘core’ processor.

The Apple Watch has a completely new user interface, different from the iPhone, and the 'crown' on the Apple Watch is a dial called the 'digital crown.'

Users can turn the crown to zoom in and out on a map, or scroll through a list. The crown can also be pressed to take the user back to the home screen.

The watch syncs with the iPhone 5C, 5S as well as the iPhone 6 and 6 Plus, and it lets users dictate messages via a microphone on the device.

Its screen is a touchscreen, but it also senses force, and can tell the difference between 'a tap and a press.' For example, pressing down will recognise as a right click.

All the electronics are packed onto a tiny board, sealed up to protect against water.

The Apple Watch comes in three finishes - Apple Watch, which comes in silver, the Apple Watch Sport and the Apple Watch Edition, which will be available in 18-karat gold.

It was unveiled alongside two new, larger and thinner iPhone handsets – the iPhone 6 and iPhone 6 Plus.
