Stoke keeper Asmir Begovic insists he is contented at Stoke City, but hasn't given up hope of playing at 'the highest level' at some point in his career.

The Bosnia-Herzegovina international is out of contract at the end of next season while struggling Liverpool have been linked with a move as Simon Mignolet continues to frustrate in goal.

Begovic gave another starring performance to deny an Arsenal comeback in Saturday's 3-2 victory at the Britannia Stadium, which has seen his stock rise even further.

However, the 27-year-old claims he is settled at the Potters - where he has played since moving from Portsmouth in 2010. 

'My future is here at Stoke as far as I'm concerned. We've got a lot of games coming up and I'm hoping to be a big part of that,' Begovic told Sky Sports.

'I've been here a few years now and enjoyed my time. I've really settled in and had a lot of support from the staff.

'We all have ambitions and goals. I work really hard to get better and try to improve as a player, and hopefully test myself at the highest level possible level in the future. 

'Who knows whether that opportunity will present itself?

'We'll see what the future holds but I'm not thinking too far ahead.'
