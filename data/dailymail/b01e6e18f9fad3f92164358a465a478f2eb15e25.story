Roger Federer cruised into the third round of the BNP Paribas Open, dismissing Argentine Diego Schwartzman 6-4, 6-2 at Indian Wells, to set up a rematch with Andreas Seppi.

Federer, hoping to capture an unprecedented fifth Indian Wells title this week, brushed past the world No 63 Schwartzman in just over an hour on Sunday - and then gave an intriguing insight in to how he has kept himself at the top of his sport for so long. 

The 33-year-old world No 2 will now face Seppi, who beat him 6-4 7-6 (7-5) 4-6 7-6 (7-5) at the Australian Open back in January.

And Federer feels his decision to not just 'chase money or more tournament victories' over the years has allowed him to stay competitive. 

'The idea was always (about) trying to be around the game for a long time,' he said. 'And for that in 2004, when I became world No. 1, I took a decision with my fitness coach at the time that we're going to plan long-term. Whatever we will do, we will plan long-term.

'Sure, we can chase money or more tournament victories. We can play more frequently, train harder, whatever we will do. But we decided we will try to stay around 20 tournaments during the year, which is a lower number.'

Ominously for his rivals Federer believes such an approach has led to him playing some of the best tennis of his career.

He said: 'I'm happy the plan worked, that at 33 I'm still being super competitive and healthy and happy to be on tour.

'I still believe I can improve my game ... I think you have to try to reinvent yourself. Tennis is actually one of those sports where I feel like you can always do better.'  

Against Schwartzman, Federer was as impressive as ever - utilising his net skills to win 13 of 14 points, hit eight aces and faced no break points during the rapid win.

The 17 time Grand Slam champion will need to replicate such form against Seppi, however, whose surprise victory over Federer was a first triumph in 11 meetings with the Swiss maestro.

Seppi advanced to the third round after dispatching Victor Hanescu 6-4, 6-4.
