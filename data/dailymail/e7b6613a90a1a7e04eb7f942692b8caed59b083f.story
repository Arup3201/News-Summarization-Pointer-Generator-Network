A man was Tasered and riot police were forced into a stand-off with two rival gangs at the trial of a rapper's alleged killer.

More than 50 officers were deployed to Birmingham Crown Court as tension mounted following a highly-charged hearing today.

Joshua Ribera, 18 - known by musics fans as Depzman - was fatally stabbed at a fundraiser in September for his friend who was murdered a year previously.

Today, Armani Deniro Mitchell pleaded not guilty to the attack in Selly Oak, Birmingham.

But the heated case sparked outrage inside the building, forcing security to separate two groups and lock down the court room.

When the hearing adjourned, the groups moved outside, enraged and shouting at each other.

Riot vans and 12 police cars were deployed to the area, Tasered a man and forced the gangs apart.

Tensions mounted as people gathered for a murder trial following the death of rapper Depzman, Joshua Ribera

One hardcore group of about six young 
men continued to confront uniformed police, who responded in driving 
them back by forming a line across the street, 
halting all traffic, and then advancing down the road towards the men.

The stand-off ended when the men eventually left the immediate area.

Mitchell was remanded in custody for a trial back at the Birmingham Crown Court which is due to start on March 3.

A West Midlands Police spokesman, commenting on the disorder outside the court room, said:

Caution: Police were stationed across the city centre to prevent the tension spreading any further

'Police have responded to a disorder at Birmingham Crown Court this afternoon.

'Officers, who were already based at the court, called for backup from colleagues at around 3:30pm.

'A Taser was discharged at a man who then ran away from the scene.

'Surrounding streets were cordoned off in the interest of public safety.

'Officers remain in attendance in and around the court as inquiries continue.'
