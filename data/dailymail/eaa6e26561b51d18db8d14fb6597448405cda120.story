Lucas Wieweck led police on a car chase through central Phoenix before crashing and trying to flee

This disturbing police mug shot shows the face of 26-year-old Lucas Wieweck, who was arrested in Phoenix, Arizona, after being caught speeding across town in a stolen car with a young family inside. 

A woman believed to be the  mother of the children, aged between two and four, was also in the car, according to AZCentral.com

In the shot a heavily tattooed Wieweck’s left eye is swollen and closed and his right is barely open as he grimaces at the camera.

The suspect sports ink across the whole of the lower half of his face below his eyes, and over his forehead below the hairline.

By the time police caught up with him he had ploughed into other cars, sped through red lights and tried to run from officers.

At about 4.30pm on Sunday the vehicle’s owner rang police to say three people, one of whom was Wieweck, had beaten him and stolen the keys to his car near 31st Street and Virginia Avenue near central Phoenix.

The caller claimed he managed to break free when the trio tried to lead him back to the car for what he feared would be a drive into the desert where he would be killed.

Two hours later the stolen vehicle was seen by officers on McDowell Road near 3rd Avenue travelling eastbound with Wieweck driving.

When a police car approached him, he reportedly switched lanes and hit three other cars as he sped through Central Avenue.

He then smashed into a traffic light at up to 40mph after trying to speed through a busy intersection on 24th Street, according to court documents.

Wieweck was caught around 50 yards away having fled on foot, leaving his four passengers behind, the police report shows.

It is not clear how they came to be in the car. 

Wieweck was arrested on suspicion of armed robbery, unlawful flight from police, endangerment and child-abuse.
