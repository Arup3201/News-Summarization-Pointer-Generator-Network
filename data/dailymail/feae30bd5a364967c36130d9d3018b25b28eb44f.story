Union leader Bob Crow was no stranger to bitter disputes in his lifetime – and now a rift over his legacy is to reach the High Court.

Mr Crow's daughter with ex-wife Geraldine Horan, Kerrie Atlee, has lodged a writ against his partner Nicola Hoarau, after being left out of his will.

Ms Hoarau, 52, is sole executor and trustee of the RMT leader's £106,000 estate but Mrs Atlee cannot believe her father would have ignored her and his grandchildren in his will, and claims it is riddled with errors.

Mrs Atlee, 32, said: 'The will is very different to what I was told. This action is a last resort.'

Ms Hoarau's solicitors dismiss the claims and say they will lodge a vehement defence later this week. When The Mail on Sunday tried to contact Ms Hoarau, her daughter said: 'No comment. We are still feeling our grief.'

Former RMT leader Bob Crow was 52 when he died in March last year from a massive heart attack

The fortune Ms Hoarau has inherited is mainly made up of savings and investments.

Mr Crow was 52 when he died in March last year from a massive heart attack.

He cut a controversial figure – adored by his union members, but often heavily criticised by commuters and politicians for his eagerness to call Tube strikes in London while enjoying a champagne lifestyle.

The RMT leader rose from a modest background to running an organisation with 80,000 members on a six-figure pay deal.

Mr Crow was elected to run the RMT in 2002, catapulting him to national fame - and notoriety - as the most radical of a new generation of union leaders.

Crow liked to be seen as a working-class hero, but was paid £145,000 a year, enjoyed fine dining in top London restaurants — memorably once quaffing champagne and running up a £650 lunch bill with four of his Left-wing brothers — and recently sparked a furore by taking a cruise to Latin America just before yet another of his strikes.

Crow also came under fire for taking a holiday to Brazil on the eve of one Tube strike. But he defended his holiday, saying: 'What do you want me to do? Sit under a tree and read Karl Marx every day?'

He also came in for criticism because of his insistence on living in publicly funded council accommodation in the north of the capital despite his hefty salary.

However, the outspoken union boss always refused to apologise, saying that he deserved his pay packet, and insisted he had a right to live in the home which he shared with Ms Hoarau, an RMT employee.
