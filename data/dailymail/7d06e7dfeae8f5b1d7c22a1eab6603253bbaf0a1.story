Caroline Foxley, pictured outside Gloucester Crown Court today, denied the money in the Swiss bank account was hers

A mother of two accused of claiming more than £20,000 in benefits when she had £300,000 deposited in a Swiss bank account has told a jury today that the overseas money was for her children, not herself.

Caroline Foxley, 59, said the £306,000 she put into the Swiss bank was the proceeds of sale of a Cotswold house that her German ex-partner Dr Kurt Mayer had paid for.

Although the account was in her name she regarded the money as 'in trust' for Dr Mayer and their children Freddie and Miranda and not hers to use, she told Gloucester Crown Court.

The prosecution has alleged that she was a 'greedy and dishonest' woman who milked the State just for 'pocket money' to top up a luxury lifestyle which included putting her children through fee-paying schools including Cheltenham Ladies College.

Prosecutor Stephen Mooney claimed at the start of the trial that Ms Foxley made a 'calm, calculated and rational' decision to abuse the benefits system.

She claimed income support, Jobseekers allowance and council tax and housing benefit despite having the £306,000 in the Swiss bank Habibsons after the sale of the house at  Moreton-in-Marsh, Gloucestershire.

But Ms Foxley said she did not use the money except for paying the children's school fees or any other expense on their behalf which Dr Mayer authorised.

She herself was without a home after the house sale and was heavily in debt, ultimately being declared bankrupt in 2012, she told the jury.

Giving evidence on the second day of her trial she said she always considered the Habibson's account to be Dr Mayer's because the money resulted from the sale of the house he had bought.

He had been an Italian based businessman who was often away from home but she regarded him as the 'love of my life,' even after their relationship ended, she said.

She told the jury he died in May last year from bowel and colon cancer but she still regarded the Swiss bank money as for the benefit of her children - 24 year old Freddie, who now lives in Moscow, and Miranda, now a geography student at Newcastle University.

When she first applied for benefits in 2006 - 2007 it was because Dr Mayer had stopped financially supporting her and the children, she said. He later became embroiled in a court case in Berlin where he was accused of fraud, she added.

At that time, because she was worried they might lose the house, she went to Berlin and got Dr Mayer to agree to transfer the house into her name.

But she insisted that after the sale of the property she had always received authorisation to pay money out of the account.

Defence lawyer David Leathley asked why if she was in such difficult financial circumstances she did not pull the children out of private education to save money. But she said she wanted them to continue with their education uninterrupted.

She told how after the relationship with Dr Mayer ended she began a relationship with a GCHQ spybase worker, Paul Watson, who moved into the house with her.

They took out a joint mortgage on the property to pay for repairs and an extension but when Dr Mayer found out about Mr Watson he was 'beside himself with anger,' she said.

'He called me a whore and sentiments along those lines,' she said.

'He said the house was for the children, how could I have done such a thing, how could I have another relationship. He had every right to be angry and I was devastated.'

Her relationship with Mr Watson ended a few weeks later and the house was sold and the £200,000 mortgage paid off - leaving her with the £306,000 equity, she said.

She paid the money into an Indian bank and then started using the money which included paying fees to Cheltenham Ladies' College (pictured), the court heard

The cheque for that was given to her in 2007 and she put it into the Habibson's Bank, later transferring 200,000 euros to the Zurich branch.

'Whose money was that?' asked Mr Leathley. 'Kurt Mayer's, it was not mine,' she replied.

She said that Dr Mayer later came back into her life and he ran up debts of £140,000 on her Lloyds TSB bank account after she made him a joint signatory to it.

That was one of the debts she was left with when he died, she said.

She told the jury that she also had a £60,000 school fees debt, she owed a friend £30,000, another friend £10,000 and had rent arrears of £9,000. She was registered bankrupt in 2012.

Mr Leathley asked why she had not solved all the financial problems by using the Swiss account money. She said: 'Because it was never my money.'

However, the prosecution say that as the money was in her name it disqualified her from receiving benefits because no-one with assets of more than £16,000 is entitled to claim.

Ms Foxley, formerly of Mickleton, Gloucestershire, but now living in Teignmouth, Devon, denies four charges of dishonestly failing to report a change in her circumstances affecting her entitlement to benefits and dishonestly making false representations to obtain benefits between March 2007 and March 2009.

The trial continues.
