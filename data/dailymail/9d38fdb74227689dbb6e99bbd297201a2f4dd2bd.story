The men of the Today Show had their beards shaped live on air this morning to mark the end of their month-long charity challenge- but none of them had them fully shaved off.

The hosts of the morning talk show program took part in the national 'No Shave November' campaign where men across America tossed out their razors for the month in an effort to raise money for various charities that support men's health.

'We didn't just do this to look terrible, we did this to raise money,' Matt Lauer said  Monday's show.

Lauer didn't really think he looked terrible, however, as he announced that he would be keeping it for the winter.

The big reveal: Viewers suggested which looks the anchors should try out, and while a couple of them were game, Lauer decided that he wanted to keep his beard

Spot the difference: Lauer decided that he just wanted the barber to give him a close trim and not actually shave the beard (before at left and after at right)

To mark the end of November, razor producer Gillette arranged for four top barbers to come in to shave the hosts and viewers were able to weigh in on styling options- choosing between a goatee, mustache, mutton chops or a chin curtain.

Al Roker said that he would try out the goatee that was suggested for him, but Lauer announced he would be disregarding the same suggestion completely and opting to just have the barbers trim the beard and allow him to keep it for the winter.

'My dad wore a goatee in the last few years of his life and he always looked good,' Roker said.

Willie Geist, who had the most trouble growing a full-fledged beard, initially said he would sport the suggested mustache for a few hours before shaving it off completely.

That cut off may come quicker as he did not take to the mustache- and knew that his wife would not either.

'I cannot go home with this,' he said.

'I'm going to transition into a different form of media, the adult form,' saying how he thought he looked like a porn star.

He's not a fan: Willie Geist (before at left and after at right) said that he looked like he was a part of the 'adult entertainment' industry and immediately knew that he would have to shave it off before going home to his wife

Carson Daly, who was joining remotely from Los Angeles, said he would do the same for the suggested goatee.

Daly clearly had the fullest beard of the bunch, as Lauer joked earlier that it took him only seven hours to grow it completely.

Not everyone loved the beards as internet commentors took the anchors to task during the Thanksgiving Day parades, saying that Lauer and Roker looked like they were homeless hobos.

‘Somebody do something! A homeless man got hold of a microphone and is covering the parade! Oh no. Wait. It's just Al Roker. Oh,’ wrote @brettfaultless.

While No-Shave November, or Movember, initially began as a way to raise money and awareness for prostate cancer, but the Today Show embraced a larger concept for the challenge with each of the hosts picking a different charity to support.

Embracing it: Roker said that his kids likened him to 'Black Santa' with the full beard (left) but decided to stick with the goatee (right) like his father had for a few years before his death

Lauer stuck with the Prostate Cancer Foundation, Roker chose the American Cancer Society, Geist chose the American Heart and Stroke Association and Daly chose the Breast Cancer Research Foundation as his mother has survived the disease that also targets men. Gillette donated $100,000 to the cause, splitting it among the four charities.

While Lauer didn't actually shave off the beard Monday morning, he did take part in the on-air prostate screenings that were held one week into the challenge.

He and Roker went to Lenox Hill Hospital in Manhattan, where Dr. David Samadi, a urologist, carried out a rectal exam on each of the men in an examination room off-screen.

Natural: Carson Daly, who was in his LA radio station at the time, said he had no trouble growing a full beard

Playful: Daly joked around with his new look but said that his 'dream is to play for the Yankees' so he would have to shave to be a member of clean-shaven team

The Today Show has a history of giving out on-air exams, starting with former anchor Katie Couric who underwent a colonoscopy live on the show in 2000 following her husband's death from colon cancer two years earlier.

While Couric and both of the male co-hosts were given clean bills of health, one of their counterparts over at ABC discovered she has breast cancer after having an on-air mammogram.

Amy Robach is now undergoing treatment for the disease and is scheduled to return to work at Good Morning America today.
