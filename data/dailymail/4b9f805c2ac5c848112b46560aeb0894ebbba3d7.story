A restaurant in New York is serving up a curry so fiercely hot chefs have to wear gas masks to prepare it.

Touted the 'world's spiciest curry' the Phaal contains eight of the chillies in the world including the Bhut Naga Jolokia, which is used to make tear gas by the Indian Military.

The curry which is being served to diners at The Brick Lane Curry House in Manhattan's Upper East Side, registers at a mind-blowing 1million units on the Scoville Scale - 200 times hotter than original Tabasco sauce.

The fiery feast has left diners sweating, crying, shaking and vomiting. Some have even hallucinated while attempting the eye-watering meal while others have collapsed and been taken to hospital by ambulance.

The curry is available with chicken, lamb, goat, paneer cheese or vegetables and costs between $15 and $21.

Every customer who manages to clear their plate is awarded a free beer, certificate and place in the restaurant's Phaal of Fame.

Dhiraj Tiwari, 33, manager at the New York curry house, said the curry was so hot even he couldn't manage it.

He said: 'India is known for its spices and we wanted to create a dish that combined Indian spices with the world's hottest chillies.

'The curry contains the Bhut Naga 
Jolokia, which measures 1million on the scoville unit. The Indian army 
use this chilli to make tear gas, it's excrutiatingly hot.

'The curry does have flavour but it has a spice that lingers and continues to burn your mouth for a long time after.

'We
 have to get diners to agree to a verbal disclaimer before they try the 
curry because it contains so many chillies it can be dangerous.

'We
 have to really convey the intensity of the heat to customers before 
they order it but I don't think anyone realises just how hot it is until
 they take a mouthful.

A diner looks nervously on as a waiter brings the potent dish to his table, ready for him to take on the taste challenge

The fiery feast has left diners sweating, crying, shaking and vomiting. Some have even hallucinated while attempting the eye-watering meal while others have collapsed

'The curry is so hot, people have suffered hallucinations while eating it. Lots of people have fainted while eating it and we've had to call 911 for people who have collapsed after eating it.

'I had one guy who actually threw up on me after eating it but when you serve the world's hottest curry, I guess you could call that an occupational hazard.

'If you want to be adventurous try it but its too hot for me, I've had one spoonful and it is unbearable pain - it's so hot it'll wipe out your taste buds.'

One diner who was brave enough to take on the challenge was Michael Gregson who decided to give it a go after being dared by his friends.

But Michael, 27, said despite being a lover of spicy food he couldn't manage more than a few mouthfuls.

Bhut Naga Jolokia chillies are one of the worlds hottest and are used in abundance in the curry

Just some of the highly potent spices used in the curry. It is available with chicken, lamb, goat, paneer cheese or vegetables

He said: 'I love a good curry, I'm always looking to challenge my taste buds with a hot curry so when my friends challenged me to take on The Phaal Challenge, I'll admit I was perhaps a little over confident.

'As soon as I took the first mouthful I knew I was in trouble, it was ridiculously hot.

'It is tasty but it has this long lasting spiciness that doesn't seem to go away.

'With each mouthful the spice instensifies, the roof of my mouth and tongue were on fire, with this unbearable, relentless heat.

'If it was up to me, I'd have given up after the first bite but I didn't want to duck out too early, so I gave it a good go but I don't think I managed more than a quarter of the dish.

'I was sweating uncontrollably, I could barely feel my tongue and no amount of rice, Naan or iced water did anything to relieve the pain.

'It was definitely worth a go and I take my hat off to any who manages to finish it but I think I may be sticking to Korma from now on.'
