Rising living costs: Energy company SSE will increase tariffs, adding £8.53 to the monthly gas and electricity bills

Energy giant SSE will increase its tariffs by 9 per cent in a move that could trigger the other ‘big six’ firms to follow suit.

More than eight million gas and electricity customers will be affected in a blow for cash-strapped families struggling with rising living costs and below-inflation pay rises.

The move will add £8.53 a month to the typical monthly direct debit, dual-fuel bill – taking the average annual bill to £1,274.

SSE, the UK’s second largest energy firm, will introduce the  increase on October 15.

The firm says the move is in response to energy price increases in wholesale markets, as well as rising costs of using the National Grid network.

British Gas parent company Centrica recently warned that wholesale price rises may lead to higher bills this autumn.

And utility groups are facing increasing costs of regulation and government-sponsored schemes, which are being passed on to customers.

Martin Lewis of MoneySavingExpert.com warned of further energy-price misery to come. He said: ‘When one moves, others follow, and over the next three months I’d expect to see similar announcements.’

He urged customers to consider switching to better deals and  said there were some good fixed-rate deals on the market. SSE said it will cap prices following  the price rise until at least the  second half of 2013.

Chief executive Ian Marchant said: ‘Unfortunately, the increases in costs that we have seen since making this pledge can no longer be absorbed and mean that we are unable to keep prices at their current levels beyond this autumn.

More misery to come: Money expert Martin Lewis warned that other energy companies are likely to follow SSE's lead, making similar announcements in the next three months

‘An increase in our prices has therefore, regrettably, become unavoidable.’

SSE, which trades as Southern Electric, Swalec and Scottish Hydro, said it had seen a 14 per cent increase in the average price in the wholesale market to secure gas for the coming winter. The group also announced changes to simplify bills by introducing a new fixed standard charge of £100 per year for fuel and a single unit rate for energy used.

Richard Lloyd, executive director of Which?, called on the Government to reform the market ahead of the expected raft of price rises.

He said: ‘We can’t go through another winter with people worrying about their energy bills.

‘The Government and the regulator 
must reform our broken energy market. It’s time for energy prices to be 
properly transparent and tariffs to be made simpler, so that consumers 
get a fair deal.’

Consumer Focus said that, following 
the October price rise, SSE will be by far the most expensive of the big
 six providers for the typical dual fuel tariff.

SSE’s price rise comes after it reduced gas prices by 4.5 per cent in March.

Last September, it increased gas prices by 18 per cent and electricity tariffs by 11 per cent.

SSE’s recent results showed its 
domestic supply operation made £271.7million last year, although this 
was 21 per cent lower than a year earlier.
