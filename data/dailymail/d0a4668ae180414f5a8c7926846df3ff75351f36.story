Russia today charged 'drunk' snowplough driver Vladimir Martynenko in connection with the air crash that caused the death of Total chief executive Christophe de Margerie.

He was accused of violating safety regulations in the Moscow airport horror that killed one of the world's most respected businessmen on 20 October.

The Falcon private jet struck 60 year old Martynenko's snowplough as it took off for Paris, killing the French oilman and three crew members.

The plane exploded in a fireball giving those on board no chance to escape.

Within several hours, Russian investigators claimed that Martynenko was drunk when he drove his snowplough back onto the runaway at the moment the jet was taking off at close to midnight.

The driver strongly denied he was intoxicated but reports say he had drunk coffee laced with a liquor before taking charge of his vehicle.

'Today snowplough driver Vladimir Martynenko was charged,' said the powerful Russian Investigative Committee, not mentioning the alcohol claim.

Earlier rookie air traffic controller Svetlana Krivsun, 23, was charged over the crash and if found guilty faces up to seven years in jail, amid suggestions that blame was being pointed at junior figures when major failings in safety procedures and equipment are crucial factors.

In a custody hearing Krivsun pleaded: 'I am a simple trainee controller.

'I am just learning under the guidance of an experienced professional, obeying his commands.'

Her union claimed the suspects were unfairly treated like 'dangerous criminals'.

Krivsun's superior chief air traffic controller Alexander Kruglov, 40, supervising her at the time of the crash, was also charged this week.

While she gave the signal to the pilot to take off, he was formally in charge. 

Chief engineer of Vnukovo airport service Vladimir Ledenev, and flight director Roman Dunayev were also charged. They also face up to seven years in jail if found guilty.

De Margerie was seen as a pro-Russian businessman who lambasted the sanctions imposed by the West on Russia.
