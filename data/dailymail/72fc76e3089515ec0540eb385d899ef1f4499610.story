Manchester United are hoping a deal for Borussia Dortmund's Mats Hummels can be revived with the German side now looking to bring in Liverpool's Portuguese centre-back Tiago Ilori as a potential replacement.

Dortmund have asked to take the 21-year-old Ilori on loan should a fee be agreed with United on the German international Hummels.

Ilori, bought for £7million by Brendan Rodgers from Sporting Lisbon last summer, was sent out on loan to Granada last 
season.

However, he impressed scouts in Spain and Germany, with Dortmund expressing an interest. Dortmund had already eyed up Ilori while he was at Lisbon, but were reluctant to splash the cash on the youngster in 2013.

Hummels is also wanted by Barcelona, who have shown an interest in Liverpool's Danish centre-back Daniel Agger.

Hummels' father Hermann said talk of a move to United was 'nonsense', but United could stretch to £30million to get the right man to bolster their defence.

Louis van Gaal confirmed a desire to bring in two new defenders this week, with Arsenal's Thomas Vermaelen still high on the Dutchman's hit list.
