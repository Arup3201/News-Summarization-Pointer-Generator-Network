Legendary Dutch coach Louis van Gaal has put himself in the frame for the Tottenham job by admitting he is ready to manage in the Barclays Premier League.

Van Gaal is currently in charge of the Holland national team and will be available full-time after next summer’s World Cup.

Tim Sherwood, who is interim manager, wants the job permanently and Levy is also expected to interview former Spurs manager Glenn Hoddle.

In the frame: Louis van Gaal has emerged as a serious target of Spurs owner Daniel Levy according to reports

Discussions: Tottenham caretaker manager Tim Sherwood will meet with Levy about the vacant job

Where to go? Levy is said to have watched Tottenham's win at Southampton with Van Gaal

Earmarked: Guus Hiddink is to take over the Dutch national team after next summer's World Cup in Brazil

Another chance? Glenn Hoddle wants to be back at Spurs even if it is only until the end of the season

Sherwood is expected to be offered the job until the end of the season but he wants it full time, leaving former manager Hoddle as Levy’s only interim option.

But Van Gaal’s glittering CV - which includes league titles with Ajax, Bayern Munich, Barcelona and AZ Alkmaar - has seduced Tottenham chairman Daniel Levy.

Dutch national television NOS knocked on Van Gaal’s door at his home in Noordwijk on Sunday after reports that Levy met the fabled coach for talks.

Van Gaal said: ‘I’ll never comment on offers. I’ve always said I want to work in the Premier League once, so there’s a chance.

‘There are times a deal is announced and there are times it’s in preparations.

‘Everyone who knows me knows I won’t do a job share.’

Tottenham’s interim manager Tim 
Sherwood pressed his claims for the job on Sunday with a 3-2 victory at 
Southampton in his first Premier League game in charge.

But
Levy is wasting no time putting plans in place for his next manager and
remarkably Hoddle is expected to meet the chairman before Christmas.

Hoddle
was sacked by Levy in September 2003 after a disastrous home defeat to 
Southampton, but he claims he is ready to steady the ship.

Van Gaal’s allure has put him in the frame and he is one of the most successful managers in the history of the game.

Tricky: Van Gaal isn't allowed dual jobs by the Dutch FA, meaning he'd only be available in the summer

Dream: Van Gaal said he wants to manage in England when asked at home by Dutch television

No secret! Sherwood has always insisted that he wants, and is ready for, the job at White Hart Lane

Fit and firing: Sherwood has already brought out the best in the previously frozen out Emmanuel Adebayor

Dutch coach Louis van Gaal has managed Ajax, Barcelona, Bayern Munich and Holland in an illustrious management career. 

The 62-year-old has 19 major honours as a boss, including the Champions League.

Levy initially wanted Van Gaal, who is quitting Holland after next summer’s World Cup, as an interim manager until the end of the season.

But the Dutch football association - 
KNVB - will not allow Van Gaal to work in a dual role ahead of the most 
important tournament in world football.

Van Gaal, 62, is being replaced by Guus Hiddink next summer, but he does not want to leave his role early.

His last club job was with Bayern Munich
and he was beaten in the Champions League final by Jose Mourinho’s 
Inter Milan side in 2010 at the Bernabeu.

Mourinho worked under Van Gaal during
the Dutchman’s spell in charge at Barcelona and is always incredibly 
respectful of his achievements in the game.

Van
Gaal is due in the country next month to to give a speech in Mourinho’s
honour when he is recognised by the Football Writers’ Association.
