Heard the one about the golf course which banned  golf buggies? Or the cafes  that refused to heat up baby food?

They might sound like bad jokes, but in fact they are just two of  the ten most unjustifiable bans in the often bizarre world of health and safety.

Other examples include a council which stopped a nursery teacher taking children to an allotment, and a manager who banned a woman from wearing flip flops in the office because they did not have enclosed toes and a supported back.

World gone mad! Cafes refusing to heat up baby food 'in case it burns the child's mouth'

The list was published by the Health and Safety Executive, which says too many middle managers are banning low-risk activities.

It also accuses companies of using elf ’n’ safety as a cover for unpopular, but profitable, policies.

One example was an airline which said a traveller could not have a blanket on an aeroplane – unless she bought one for £5.

Since April the Myth Busters Challenge Panel, established by the HSE, has invited those who believe they are victims of a ludicrous health and safety ruling to email in and get a professional view.

The panel may then contest decisions made by insurance companies, local authorities and employers.

All the examples on the list were deemed to be cases where an organisation was using health and safety wrongly, perhaps as a smokescreen for an unpopular decision or poor customer service, or because of a nonsensical interpretation of the law. In the golf example, buggies were prohibited because they were not ‘health and safety authorised’.

The cafes that wouldn’t warm up baby 
food apparently told the mother they couldn’t ‘in case it burns the 
child’s mouth’. Yet they were selling hot drinks.

Ridiculous! Campers told they would have to pay for two plots because they had a camper van and a tent

Ministers have promised reforms of health and safety laws.

Employment minister Chris Grayling said: ‘It’s hugely frustrating when excuses are being made in the name of health and safety. The Myth Busters Challenge Panel is helping the man and woman on the street fight back against the jobsworths.’
