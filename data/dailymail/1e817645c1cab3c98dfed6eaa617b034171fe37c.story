This is the terrifying moment the 10-year-old son of Steve Irwin bravely faced off against a giant crocodile.

Robert Irwin stepped into the crocodile enclosure at his late father's Australia Zoo near Beerwah on Queensland's Sunshine Coast on Thursday and got a little bit too close for comfort as he went face to face with the reptile.

Robert was feeding the crocodile in front a packed crowd for the zoo's daily feeding show at the Crocoseum when the animal's patience seemed to run out.

'I've seen him feed the crocs a few times, but I've never seen him get that close before,' an onlooker told Daily Mail Australia.  

'I think Bob was holding the meat where the crocodile couldn't actually see it, so I think its patience was running out. I guess he'll know to throw the meat where it can be seen next time.'

'They're dangerous creatures (and) are unpredictable. I'm guessing that's why Wes was holding him tight,' the onlooker said. 

It was same reptile enclosure that his father controversially carried him into in 2004 when he was just a baby as a ravenous crocodile was waiting to be fed

It was same reptile enclosure that his father controversially carried him into in 2004 when he was just a baby as a ravenous crocodile was waiting to be fed.

'There was a stunned silence at how close Bob was getting,' the onlooker said.

'There were lots of oohs and ahhs as the crocodile's jaws snapped.' 

US singer Justin Timberlake and his entourage were among the throng of people watching Bob's close encounter. 

'We’re all really proud of how well Robert is doing during our Wildlife Warriors show,' a spokeswoman from Australia Zoo told Daily Mail Australia.  

The famous crocodile hunter died in 2006 when he was stung by a sting ray. His son Bob was just three years old

The late Steve Irwin was criticised at the time for putting his one-month-old son 'at risk' being so close to the huge crocodile

Bob fed his first saltwater crocodile on his 10th birthday last year. 

His proud mum Terri and sister Bindi rushed forward to hug Bob as the crowd at Australia Zoo cheered him on.

Robert has also been quite the jetsetter and travelled all over the world attending events like the Emmys and the Nickelodeon Kids Choice Awards
