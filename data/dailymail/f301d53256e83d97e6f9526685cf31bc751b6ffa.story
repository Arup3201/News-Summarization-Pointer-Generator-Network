Couples who want to stay together should learn to run a bath for each other, according to advice yesterday from a taxpayer-funded relationships campaign.

Little gestures can demonstrate commitment, smooth over conflict, and build strong and healthy relationships, it claimed.

The ‘love nuggets’ programme is urging couples to make cups of tea for each other; leave notes around the house for a spouse to find; or take their other half to the cinema even when they don’t want to see the film themselves.

It is being paid for by the Department for Education, which has provided special funding nearly £3million to the OnePlusOne relationship charity to ‘encourage couples to take proactive steps to strengthen their relationship from the start, rather than allowing it to reach crisis point before seeking support.’

The campaign comes complete with a website on which couples can find a ‘love nuggets generator’, which, the charity said, will provide inspiration with random suggestions of gestures by which couples can perk up their own love lives.

But the scheme came in for criticism from relationship analysts who believe high levels of marriage breakdown need deeper solutions than advice on whether to make your spouse a cup of tea. The ‘love nuggets’ campaign has been launched at a time when the low chance that a cohabiting couple will stay together means nearly half of all young teenagers live with just one of their birth parents.

Harry Benson of the Marriage Foundation think tank said: ‘The Government should be encouraging relationships education. But I think ‘love nuggets’ falls short.’

The campaign, which is described as ‘a quest to uncover and celebrate the everyday things people do that make a happy relationship’.

A man taking his girlfriend to the cinema to see a romantic film he feels he may not enjoy is said to be ‘a great example of a compromise’.

Women are told they might put their arm around their man when they are out in public, even when they are talking to someone else. They might also make creative presents, such as a compilation of photos and a favourite song to go with them.

Men might consider providing their wife with breakfast in bed on a Saturday morning, or stroking their girlfriend’s hair while she falls asleep.

Penny Mansfield of OnePlusOne said: ‘It is easy to get caught up in the larger issues that relationships tend to throw up and, in doing so, overlook the smaller, more subtle things that do really matter and can help keep a relationship healthy and strong.

‘It ‘s these small acts that help us to connect with our lover, demonstrate our commitment, improve communication, show we care, achieve compromise and even resolve conflicts.

‘We want people to recognise the value of the simple gestures and to give others ideas of everyday things they could be doing to strengthen a relationship. We want to find out what some of the most common examples are as well as some of the more unusual love nuggets.’

The charity, which is largely state-funded, has been paid £2.7million by the Education Department for its efforts to strengthen relationships, with another payment from the ministry on top for ‘on-line services’.

A series of other groups are supporting the campaign, including Netmums, dad.info and youth websites.

However Mr Benson said: ‘It doesn’t hurt to give hints and tips.

‘But it is so much better if people start their relationship on a secure basis in the first place, most obviously by getting married. The number one predictor of whether people will stay together in the long term is whether they get married. If you don’t the chances of sticking together are slim.’
