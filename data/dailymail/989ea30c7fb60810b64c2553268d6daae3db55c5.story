Nigel Farage has condemned a phone app made by schoolchildren featuring a character called Nicholas Fromage kicking immigrants off the white cliffs of Dover.

The UKIP leader said the game where players kick immigrants as far as possible to gain the highest 'racism' rating is 'risible and pathetic' and 'crosses the line'.

But Canterbury Academy principal Phil Karnavas said the technology class' project was 'just a bit of fun'.

The student developers, who have formed game design company FonGames, say the game called Ukik aims to 'make a mockery of extremist views'.

Mr Farage said he accepted criticism as a public figure but attacked the implication Ukip was racist.

He said: 'Those elements are risible and in many ways pathetic. I think I'm quite well known for having a sense of humour. I'm a public figure and of course people are going to have views. But elements of this game appear to cross the line.'

He added: 'Fair play to them for having a bit of fun. If they want to go away and look at Ukip policies, they will actually learn a lot.'

The game features an apparent manifesto from the fictional Nicholas Fromage, Ukik leader, saying: 'If you are feeling irrational and want to live in a right wing hell hole then vote UKIK this May.

'These people might improve our economy, contribute to our culture and make Britain great but they are different to us so let's kick them all out!'

Mr Farage said he accepted criticism as a public figure, but elements of the same - such as the use of the term 'racism' - were unacceptable

The migrant-kicking 'Ukik' game was developed by a group of 18-year-old students from Canterbury Academy - John Brown, James Dupreez, Fraser Richardson, John Hutchinson and Joe Brown.

It is available on Google Play, where it has been given a five-star rating by 60 players.

According to the game's disclaimer, it was developed to 'highlight the importance of a diverse culture for our great nation as well as make a mockery of extremist views'.

Its description reads: 'If you are feeling irrational and want to live in a right wing hell hole then vote UKIK this May.'

Principal Mr Karnavas said: 'It's certainly topical and should stimulate discussion about political issues amongst young people - something we are constantly told is important.

'But, really as political satire it is just a bit of fun. Many politicians don't need help to make themselves look daft, or to say very silly things, but they should at least have the ability to laugh at themselves.

'This game may be a bit 'edgy' but I suspect it will not bring the British political system crashing down!'

The game has been developed by 18-year-olds John Brown, James Dupreez, Fraser Richardson, John Hutchinson and Joe Brown.

The group are all learning coding, graphic design and game development and have been making mobile games about spaceships and platform games.

FonGames describes itself as 'a team of developers who create games based upon controversial news stories for the purposes of entertainment and to encourage political discussion amongst young people.'

Marcus Ball, a co-founder of Ambition House, which was set up at the Canterbury Academy campus two years ago with the aim of fast-tracking 16 to 24-year-olds into setting up their own digital businesses, said: 'What's great about UKIK is that it has been created by young people to encourage others of their age to start talking about politics.

'It's irreverent and a game based upon the British tradition of political satire that pokes fun at a high profile figure and should not be taken too seriously as it is entertainment.'

A Ukip parliamentary candidate  has claimed a 'homosexual donkey' tried to rape his horse.

John Rees-Evans, who is running for Cardiff South and Penarth in May's general election, told the story to protesters outside a new campaign office in Merthyr Tydfil.

An anti-Ukip demonstrator had asked him about controversial remarks by fellow party members - including on from Dr Julia Gasper in Oxford, who allegedly claimed that 'some homosexuals prefer sex with animals'

Mr Rees-Evans replied: 'Actually, I've witnessed that. I've got a horse and it was there in the field. And a donkey came up…which was male, and I'm afraid tried to rape my horse.'

The horse bit the 'homosexual donkey' in defence, the former soldier said. 

He added: 'I don't think that's what she meant but it's a coincidence.'
