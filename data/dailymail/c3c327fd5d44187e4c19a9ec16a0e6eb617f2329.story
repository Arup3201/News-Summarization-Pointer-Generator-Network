Coronation Street star Michael Le Vell was pictured for the first time since he was charged with child sex offences.

The 48-year-old actor was seen walking through the village of Hale, in Cheshire, yesterday as he made his way to a pub ahead of the FA Cup match between Manchester City and Leeds United.

Le Vell, who plays love-rat mechanic Kevin Webster, has been charged with 19 sex offences - six of child rape, six of indecent assault and seven of sexual activity with a child.

The actor insists he is innocent of the allegations and has vowed to ‘fight the charges vigorously’.

The show's bosses have said he would not be appearing in any further episodes while legal proceedings are under way.

It is thought they are furiously trying to come up with a solution to Kevin Webster's sudden disappearance.

The actor was first arrested under 
his real name, Michael Turner, in September 2011 and questioned after a 
teenage girl claimed he had sexually assaulted her from the age of six.

Three
months later, however, prosecutors said there was insufficient evidence
to take the allegations to court and no charges were brought.

At the time the father of two said he was ‘delighted’ to have been ‘completely exonerated’.

He thanked police for their ‘thorough investigation’, and expressed his gratitude to fans and the Coronation Street cast for their loyal support during ‘a most difficult and upsetting phase in my life’.

He returned to the show after a short break and is currently involved in some of its main storylines.

However,
on Thursday evening it was announced that after a review of the 
evidence, Le Vell had been charged with 19 sex offences, including 
raping a child, indecently assaulting a child and sexual activity with a
child.

Le Vell will next appear in court on February 27 - since being charged the actor has protested his innocence.

In a  statement Le Vell has said said 
that following the serious allegations that had been made, he wanted to 
make it ‘quite clear’ that he was ‘innocent of these charges and intend 
to fight them vigorously’.

He added:  ‘I will now put all my efforts into clearing my name and proving my innocence.’

Thanking friends, family and fans for their continued support, he said he would now concentrate on preparing his defence.

Sorry we are unable to accept comments for legal reasons.
