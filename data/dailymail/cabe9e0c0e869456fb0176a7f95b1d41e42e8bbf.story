Fed-up officials secretly cleared the office of Tory grandee Lord Heseltine in an attempt to stop him popping into a government department, MailOnline can reveal.

Ten months after the former Deputy Prime Minister published a report for the government on how to boost the economy, he still had use of a ministerial office at the Department for Business, Innovation and Skills.

Civil servants moved in earlier this week to pack his belongings into boxes, but have been ordered to put it all back after Downing Street intervened.

Out of office: Officials at the Department for Business moved in to clear the office of Lord Heseltine 10 months after he finished his review

Lord Heseltine produced his report – No Stone Unturned – in October last year, setting out 89 recommendations for ways George Osborne could kickstart the economy.

Since then he has had no formal role in government and had been awaiting further instruction from the Downing Street.

But he has continued to the office given to him in the Business Department on Victoria Street in central London. His Jaguar became a frequent fixture in the department’s car park.

Big beasts of the Tory party do not come much bigger than Lord Heseltine.

He famously quit as Defence Secretary in Margaret Thatcher’s government in 1986 before challenging her for the Tory leadership four years later.

While his bid failed, the Iron Lady was ousted and replaced by John Major who returned him to the Cabinet.

Nicknamed Tarzan after swinging the ceremonial mace above his head during a debate in the Commons, Heseltine was Deputy Prime Minister when the Tories lost power in 1997.

A strong advocate of economic intervention, he championed the regeneration of Liverpool.

When the coalition was formed in 2010 David Cameron was keen to show he was using the experience in senior Tory ranks and asked Lord Heseltine to carry out a report into boosting regional economies.

The study, published in October last year, was called No Stone Unturned In Pursuit of Growth and featured a cartoon of the politician peering under a boulder.

Officials grew fed up with him ‘hanging around’ without a proper job. ‘He keeps coming in and using the office as if he is a minister,’ said a source.

Exasperated mandarins sought ways to 
ease him out without causing offence but it understood that earlier this
week staff sought to use the start of the parliamentary recess to 
reclaim the office.

‘BIS had
been racking their brains ever since his review concluded about how to 
get rid of him in a diplomatic way because he has kept coming in.

‘It’s not like he uses the office that often – but he uses it enough.’

In his report last year Lord Heseltine claimed ministers had failed to devise a ‘credible’ growth strategy and must put the country on an economic ‘war footing'.

He urged Mr Cameron and Mr Osborne to act now on immigration, airports and energy policy if they want to boost growth.

He called for £70billion of extra 
funding for the regions to secure the economic recovery in areas outside
London and the south east.

But when the government responded it pledged only £12billion, of which just a third was considered new money.

The office was cleared earlier this week, but when Lord Heseltine found out Number 10 had to intervene.

A
senior aide to David Cameron is understood to have told the department 
that the office had to remain, and all of Lord Heseltine’s belongings 
and papers returned.

Lord Heseltine told MailOnline: ‘I do not know what BIS does with offices.’

He added that as far as he was aware he still had use of an office in BIS.

Intervention: An aide to David Cameron stepped in to resolve the office dispute over Lord Heseltine's office

A Department for Business spokesman said: 'Lord Heseltine's important root and branch review of growth has now been completed so he no longer in the department as frequently.

'But we have made clear that we will continue to meet any requests for office space he may have and have discussed this with his office.'

Official ministerial cars have been borrowed by civil servants for their own use.

Mandarins have been cleared to jump in the back of government limos when no one else is using them.

Tory MP Gavin Williamson discovered the practice in a series of parliamentary questions.

When the coalition was formed most ministers lost their dedicated car and driver to cut costs.

Instead they were told to use a 'pool' when they needed a limo, but should use public transport where possible.

But departments have admitted that when ministers leave them behind mandarins can be driven around in them instead.

Mr Williamson told the BBC:  'I think some civil servants are still stuck in the world or Sir Humphrey and should recognise the fact that those cars aren't there to chauffeur them around in the lap of luxury. They're for the purpose of work.'
