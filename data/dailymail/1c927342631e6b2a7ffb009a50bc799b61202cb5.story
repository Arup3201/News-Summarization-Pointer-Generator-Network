Horrified witnesses thought they'd stumbled upon a grisly serial killer when this pick-up truck overturned on a motorway in southern China, spilling 16 bodies onto the carriageway.

Police sealed off the road in Luozhou, Sichuan province, but abandoned a murder hunt when the driver turned out to be a professor from the city's medical school who'd bought the bodies for his students to use in class.

'They began to go off pretty quickly once they were stretched out in the sun. The smell was sickening,' said one motorist.

Murder alert: Witnesses feared a serial killer was on the loose when this truck overturned on a motorway in China, spilling 16 bodies onto the tarmac

'A lot of people stopped to have a look, but when they say the horrific sight and caught a whiff of the bodies many people jumped back into their cars and went away as fast as possible.'

Police were having difficulty dealing with the incident because of the smell, but had to grit their teeth and get on with the job after they were given masks to cover their noses and mouths.

One officer said: 'It was the worst scene I have ever had to attend. There were so many bodies. The smell was overwhelming. We had to pick the bodies up and clear the road.'

Police loaded the bodies into ambulances to take them to their not-so-final resting place - in the college fridge.

False alarm: Police sealed off the road, but later established that the driver was a professor who had legally bought the corpses for use at his medical school

Now the college is facing furious public criticism for carrying bodies 'without dignity' on the back of a truck.

A spokesman for the Luozhou Medical School said: 'We bought the bodies legally and fairly."

'They are the remains of unclaimed 
murder victims, street people who have died and criminals who have been 
executed,' they added.

'It is normal practise to use cheap 
bodies from such sources. It was just unfortunate that such an accident 
happened with the bodies during transport - otherwise no-one would have 
complained.'

He added that despite a few extra scratches the bodies were still usable and would still end up on the dissecting table.

The spokesman also rejected the 
criticism over the pick-up truck corpse shipment and said all bodies 
were treated with dignity and respect by students at the medical school.

But he added: 'After this incident we 
will be reviewing how the bodies are transported to our school to ensure
such an incident does not happen again.'

Police are also investigating whether transporting of the bodies was done in a correct way, and whether it broke any laws.
