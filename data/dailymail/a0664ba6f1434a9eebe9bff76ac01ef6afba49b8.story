England coach Stuart Lancaster has raised the prospect of Steffon Armitage being called out of Test exile for next year’s World Cup, just as the Toulon back-rower was named European Player of the Year.

The 28-year-old delivered another man-of-the-match display as his club retained the Heineken Cup on Saturday.

He also revived a debate about the RFU’s edict against England selecting overseas-based players, with Sportsmail columnist Sir Clive Woodward among those to condemn the policy.

Conundrum: Steffon Armitage could still be called up for the World Cup, says England coach Stuart Lancaster

Champion: Armitage (left) helped Toulon lift the Heineken Cup by beating Saracens on Saturday

Lancaster, who hinted that Danny 
Cipriani will be on the bench against New Zealand in the first Test, 
said of Armitage: ‘Who’s to say that this time next year, if he’s still 
playing as well, that the door might not be open?’

Lancaster
 is fully aware of the ex-London Irish player’s exploits - and the 
support for him to be given another international chance. While he won’t
 consider recalling the openside-cum-No 8 for the tour of New Zealand, 
he may relent next year.

Asked
 about the RFU policy, Lancaster said: ‘It is a good rule and one I 
support. That said, there are exceptional circumstances that allow us to
 select an overseas-based player. So who’s to say that this time next 
year, if he’s still playing as well, that the door might not be open?

Impressive: Lancaster was in the crowd as Armitage starred for Toulon on Saturday at Millennium Stadium

‘It
 would have to be close to a World Cup. I wouldn’t do it for the New 
Zealand tour, autumn internationals or the Six Nations, not when I’ve 
got other players who can be developed.’

For
 the next year, the door will almost certainly remain shut, as Lancaster
 added: ‘It’s got to be associated with injuries (for now). It’s a rule 
supported by clubs, the country, the RFU and the PGB (Professional Game 
Board).  I spoke with Toby Flood about going to Toulouse and he is aware
 of the position. That’s the risk you take.’

While
 Welsh players, in particular, are leaving domestic clubs in numbers, 
there has not been a huge exodus of English stars across the Channel.

Outcast: Armitage last played for England in 2010, but hasn't been eligible since his move to France

Lancaster
 suggested that validates the RFU’s approach. ‘You want players to play 
in our club programme because it helps our club game, it helps the 
development of players,’ he said.

‘If
 Steffon or Toby were to go (with England), what would happen next? If 
Manu (Tuilagi), Corbs (Corbisiero), Courtney (Lawes), Owen (Farrell) — 
the list goes on — chose to go, it would have a knock-on effect but I’m 
not getting any indication of that. The younger players, all they’re 
talking about is wanting to play for England and play for their clubs.’
