Terminator star Arnold Schwarzenegger has backed Boris Johnson to become Prime Minister, bringing some Hollywood glamour to the London Mayor’s hopes of one day getting the keys to Number 10.

The former California governor hailed Mr Johnson as a ‘visionary’ with all the qualities needed to be a great leader.

The fulsome endorsement is the latest chapter in the duo’s bizarre relationship, just a week after Mr Johnson described the blockbuster actor as an ‘Austrian cyborg’.

Boris Johnson has been hailed as 'charming, funny and very clever' by his one-time foe Arnold Schwarzenegger. The pair rode Boris Bikes in London last year

The Tory party conference in Birmingham last week was dominated by speculation about Mr Johnson’s leadership ambitions.

Mr Johnson used a speech to a ConservativeHome rally to repeat his swipe at Schwarzenegger's Austrian accent.

Despite giving fulsome backing to David Cameron, the London Mayor also attacked government policy on tax, aviation and housing.

Opinion polls have suggested the Conservative share of the vote would go up with Mr Johnson at the helm, although he has promised to serve his full second term as Mayor of London until 2016.

Now Schwarzenegger has backed him to one day become Prime Minister for having the key skill in politics: likeability.

‘He has the qualities that are essential for a leader,’ Schwarzenegger told the Daily Telegraph.

‘For politicians, it’s all about personality. Boris is charming, he’s funny, and he’s very clever.

‘But also he is a visionary and he’s very likeable — and that’s really important in politics.’

In August the duo took a ride on the Emirates cable car from Greenwich to the ExCeL in Docklands, after watching the Olympic basketball in Greenwich

Schwarzenegger is in London promoting his new film, The Last Stand.

During his publicity tour he has also warned the Prime Minister against trying to copy Mr Johnson’s populist appeal.

‘Cameron must not try to imitate Johnson,’ he told The Spectator.

‘It would be a disaster. Johnson is authentic. It has to be organic. Cameron must just be himself.’

The Schwarzenegger-Johnson love-in is the latest stage in their flourishing relationship, which got off to a bad start in 2007 when Schwarzenegger was caught on camera describing Mr Johnson’s speech as ‘fumbling’.

A year later the Tory heavyweight got his revenge, declaring: ‘It was a low moment, my friends, to have my speaking style denounced by a monosyllabic Austrian cyborg.’

The pair patched things up in 2011 when they demonstrated the popular Boris Bikes on the streets of London.

And in August this year the duo took a ride on the Emirates cable car from Greenwich to the ExCeL in Docklands after watching Olympic basketball.
