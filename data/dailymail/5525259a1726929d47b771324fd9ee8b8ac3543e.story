An online shopper has been left dumbfounded after a parcel he ordered was left wedged in his gutter - 20ft above his front door - by a bungling delivery company. 

A driver from courier firm myHermes  left a note for Benjamin Ward, 24, of Hove, East Sussex that read: 'Today I called to deliver your parcel. Stuck on the roof - sorry'.

The confused customer, who has no idea how it got there, alerted the company on Twitter and his pictures chronicling the incident have gone viral.

Hitting the roof: A customer has been left furious after a delivery company left a parcel wedged in his guttering

Message: The delivery driver left a note in the front door saying simply: 'Stuck on roof - sorry!'

As a result the embarrassed courier company sent someone to the house with a ladder to retrieve the parcel.

Bamboozled: Benjamin Ward says he has no idea how the parcel ended up there - but hopes the driver keeps his job 

Mr Ward said: 'I laughed. It is just ridiculous. I think he must have been trying to lob it over the house.

'It was more funny than anything else so I don't really want to make a big deal of it. They sent him back to get it down with a ladder and say sorry. It was super awkward.'

A MyHermes spokesperson said: 'This is unacceptable. We would like to apologise once again for the inconvenience this has caused.'

After his initial tweet Mr Ward was flooded with messages asking what had happened but he admitted he had no idea.

He tweeted: 'Ridiculous isn't it. I have no idea! Shows what happens to our parcels though! I need a ladder'.

He added: 'Trying to throw it over the house I think!

One user tweeted: 'At least they delivered it', to which Benjamin replied: 'There is that'.

But despite the poor service he has said he would feel 'horrendously awkward' if the delivery worker lost their job over the incident.
