A teenager accused of killing a ten-year-old boy after storming into a nail salon has been charged with a second murder carried out just two weeks earlier at a nearby motel.

Miami Police said Anthawn 
Ragan, 19, fatally shot a 21-year-old man on November 1, at the 
Motel 7, located in the north of the city. Two other suspects wanted for the shooting remain at large.

According to police, the victim Luis Perez was shot multiple times at point-blank range with the gunmen continuing to fire while he was lying on the ground.

Ragan was captured on the surveillance tape at the motel firing two of the shots.

The gunmen escaped in a 1999-2000 model, dark-colored, four-door Nissan Maxima saloon.

The
suspects are described as black males. One was wearing a black 
skull-cap, the other had a heavy, full beard and was wearing a brown 
leather jacket.

'A
police spokesman said: 'What concerns us is that his accomplices are 
still out there and in the community, so although we’re pleased that 
Ragan is in custody and police have taken him off the street, we are 
still concerned  that his accomplices are still out there.'

Just
a two weeks later, Ragan and an accomplice are accused of shooting 
dead 10-year-old Aaron Vu and injuring his father, Hai Nam Vu.

He has also been accused of battery on a law enforcement officer after allegedly becoming violent when he was apprehended at around 6am yesterday at a family member's home on his 19th birthday.

He was questioned at Miami-Dade Police Station and is being held without bond.

Ragan is also linked to a robbery in north Miami and has a long criminal history, it was reported by NBC Miami.

Two intruders were caught on a surveillance camera entering the Hong Kong Nail Salon at 14832 Northwest 7th Avenue at around 7.30pm with their guns drawn and then fleeing, but not before spraying the inside of the store with bullets.

Manhunt: The gunmen, one of them masked, got away with purses, cell phones and an unspecified sum of cash, and fled in a Dodge Ram pickup truck

Aaron and his father were flown to 
Jackson Memorial Hospital, where the 10-year-old was pronounced dead 
from his injuries a short time later, the station WSVN reported.

According
to investigators, the unidentified gunmen, one of whom was wearing a 
mask, got away with customers' purses, cell phones and an unspecified 
sum of cash.

They took off in an unknown direction in a black Dodge Ram pick-up truck, police told NBC Miami.

Miami-Dade Crime Stoppers is offering a $25,000 reward for information leading to an arrest as police hunt a second suspect.

Speaking from hospital, Mr Vu said: 'Why did this have to happen? Why couldn’t it just have been me? They killed an innocent child.'

Meanwhile, hundreds from the community came together at the nail salon yesterday for an emotional tribute to Aaron.

Small tribute: A makeshift memorial has sprung up in front of the salon in honor of the slain little boy who was described as funny and outgoing

Police investigating the deadly heist distributed fliers to the owners of nearby businesses and released the surveillance video showing the pair of suspects.

‘I hope the people in the community are as outraged as we are,’ Lt. Jim Tietz, of the Miami-Dade Police told CBS Miami.

‘These people need to be caught. They need to be taken off the street if they’ve done it once they’ll do it again and anybody could be a victim.’

Salon employees and customers told Miami Herald Hai and Lynn Vu, Aaron’s parents, have been running the popular business for at least five years.
