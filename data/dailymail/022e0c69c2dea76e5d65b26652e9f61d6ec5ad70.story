Hat-trick hero John Guidetti claimed Rangers or any other of Celtic's Scottish League Cup semi-final opponents will be 'going down' if they are drawn against the Parkhead men.

The 22-year-old Swede, on loan from Manchester City, took his tally to eight in eight games for the Hoops with two wonderful free-kicks and a penalty in the 6-0 quarter-final thrashing of Partick Thistle at Celtic Park.

Substitute Leigh Griffiths grabbed a brace and left-back Emilio Izaguirre also notched as Ronny Deila's side ran riot albeit against a side who played the second-half with 10 men after midfielder Stuart Bannigan was shown a straight red card by referee Kevin Glancy for a needless challenge on Guidetti just before the break.

The win set up a possibility of what would be the first Old Firm meeting in almost three years in the semi-final, rivals Rangers clinching their last-four place with a 1-0 win over St Johnstone at Ibrox on Tuesday night, while Aberdeen and Dundee United will also be in Saturday's draw.

Asked about the possibility of playing the Light Blues at Hampden Park after the New Year, Guidetti said: 'Of course it would be a fantastic game to be a part of. Whatever happens, happens.

'Come Hampden Park, 11 people standing in front of us, they are going down. Hampden Park will be amazing, no matter who we play.

'I am excited about every game for Celtic.

'We all know (the Old Firm clash) is a special game. This is a game I woke up at 11.30am when I was a small kid to watch.

'It is fantastic, very spicy and you see that it means a lot.

'The atmosphere is amazing, you can hear it through the television.

'But we need to stay focused. There are four good teams left in the cup and this club deserves trophies so hopefully we can do this.'

Manager Ronny Deila, delighted with the form of Guidetti and the rest of his side's performance, tip-toed around the possibility of an Old Firm game.

He said: 'For me it is about winning trophies and we are now two wins away from getting the first one.

'So I am looking forward to the semi-final, who we meet doesn't bother me. We just have to win.

'What you remember when your career is finished is titles and that's why I'm here - to win trophies and make sure Celtic is successful. To do that we have to meet whatever team is in front of us.'

Jags boss Alan Archibald admitted that the red card was the correct decision and was not best pleased with Bannigan.

He said: 'It probably is nowadays (a red). I think the reaction of the Celtic players made it look like that as well I don't think that helps either.

'I'm disappointed as I felt he didn't have to make the challenge. I think he wins the ball but it is probably the manner he goes in.

'He's disappointed, he's sitting with his head in his hands at half-time. He can't blame excitement playing against Celtic.

'He's a professional footballer and was probably having a good game up to that point. It's just a rush of blood I think.'
