An elderly man who was locked in a Houston garage for more than a year so his captor could allegedly cash in his welfare checks has died a week after he was freed.

William Merle Greenawalt, 79, was one of three men held captive in the garage without beds or bathrooms on July 19, police said. A fourth man was found in the property's house.

Their alleged captor, 31-year-old Walter Renard Jones, beat Greenawalt with a cane, according to the felony complaint. The man died on July 25 and his cause of death has not been released.

Greenawalt was found in a garage that authorities have called a 'dungeon'. The men were forced to sleep on the filthy floor, had no restroom, were only given scraps of food and there was a variety of locks on the door to keep them inside, court records show.

Another man was discovered in the house, where Jones lived with his grandmother. He said he had been held at the home for around six months.

They were found after a neighbor tipped off police, who arrived to carry out a welfare check. Police found the garage door nailed shut and had to break burglar bars on the window to reach the men.

Charged: Walter Jones, 31, was charged with injury to the elderly after the grim discovery

The converted garage
had no furniture except for one chair, a malfunctioning air conditioning
 unit, 
and was filthy, with police describing it to ABC 13 as like 'a warehouse for people'.

The men were so badly malnourished that hey were carried from the home on stretchers and hospitalized.

The two others - Dean Cottingham, 59,
 and John Edward Padget, 64 - have now been released to the custody of Adult
 Protective Services. It is believed they were homeless before the ordeal.

They told police that Jones persuaded them to move into the house in exchange for shelter and food, but they were locked in and forced to turn over their Social Security and veteran's benefit checks.

'They were 
apparently given scraps to eat,' police spokesman Jodi Silva said. 'Very little food was being
 provided to them. They didn't have access to a restroom.

'They clearly stated to us they were being kept against their will.'

The fourth man, who was living at the house, allegedly told officers he did not want to leave.

In custody: A man believed to be Jones sits in a police car. The captives were lured inside under the promise of cigarettes and alcohol while the captor used them to cash their government assistance checks

Jones was arrested on July 19 and charged with injury to the elderly by act and injury to the elderly by omission. Police have not said whether they would upgrade the charges in light of the death.

It is not
 yet known if four women who had been living in the main part of the 
house, owned by Jones' grandmother Essie Mae Scranton, were also being held captive.

Three of them were said to have disabilities and mental illness, and the fourth was described as a caregiver.

Adult Protective Services has been called to help in the investigation.

Red flag: Police found the alleged victims during a welfare check, after a tip off from a neighbor

Little explanation: No names of individuals involved have been released, but police described the building where the men were being held as being 'deplorable conditions'

Harris County court records show that Jones has a criminal record extending back to 2001 and has previously been arrested for theft and possession of marijuana.

In 2009, a grand jury indicted him on a charge of failing to register as a sex offender after he was convicted in juvenile court in 1997 of two counts of felony aggravated sexual assault of a child.

But this 2009 charge was eventually dismissed for lack of evidence, court records show, NBC News reported.
