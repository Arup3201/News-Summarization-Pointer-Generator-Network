An intensive care unit nurse who survived her fight against Ebola has claimed the treatment has made her hair fall out, causes insomnia and has damaged her social life.

Nina Pham was diagnosed with the deadly disease along with co-worker Amber Vinson after treating Thomas Eric Duncan, the first patient to die from the illness in October.

The 26-year-old was given the all-clear, but has revealed this week she is suing Texas Presbyterian Hospital, claiming she became the 'symbol of corporate neglect', as senior officials failed to adequately prepare for the crisis. 

She said her training in treating those with the virus was on a single piece of paper found by her supervisor online.  

Concerns: Nina Pham, who was diagnosed with the deadly disease in October, says the experimental drugs used in her treatment is causing her hair to fall out and makes her suffer aches, pains and fatigue 

Miss Pham also fears that her health will be constantly affected by the experimental drugs she was given and is already suffering aches, pains and fatigue.

If she has a glass of wine at dinner, she will always feel sick, and she constantly has nightmares about her ordeal. 

Doctors have also warned her to check for signs of vision loss as well as sensory and organ failure. 

She split up with her boyfriend, who was  quarantined as a precaution, after she was released from hospital and struggles to interact with friends because 'Ebola always comes up'.

'I wanted to believe that they would have my back and take care of me, but they just haven't risen to the occasion,' she told The Dallas Morning News.

'I was the last person besides Mr. Duncan to find out he was positive' she said. 'You'd think the primary nurse would be the first to know.I broke down and cried, not because I thought I had it but just because it was a big 'whoa, this is really happening' moment.

Pham said she considered not going back to care for Duncan after his diagnosis, with her colleagues insisting they would back up her decision. But she felt she had to. 

Criticizing how the hospital prepared for the crisis, she said the extent of her training was a single piece of paper one of her superiors found online. 

Privacy issues: A doctor wearing a video camera came into her room, claiming he was making an educational video. She did not give permission for the video, which was subsuqently released to the media

Smiling: After Miss Pham was given the all-clear, she was invited to the Oval Office where she met President Obama. The intensive care nurse is now suing Texas Presbyterian Hospital, claiming she became a symbol of 'corporate neglect'

The day after Duncan died, Pham  met with someone from the CDC and the hospital's employee health manager to review Duncan's care. They also deemed her 'no risk' in terms of contracting the Ebola virus. 

When tests confirmed she had the virus, she broke down crying, and asked medical staff that her name be released as 'Jane Doe' to protect her privacy.  The request was refused and from then on Miss Pham became the face of the fight against Ebola in the United States. 

She said: 'Just knowing the whole world's watching but you're so isolated and the people that are coming [in to care for me] are risking their lives.'Touching me is life-threatening. It's very lonely.'

Before she was transferred to Maryland, a doctor wearing a video camera came into her room, claiming he was making an educational video. Miss Pham said she did not give permission for the video, which was subsuqently released to the media.

She told the Morning News: 'They had just a PR nightmare with what happened with Mr. Duncan … and then us being infected with Ebola. Not just one nurse, but two. People lost faith in them, especially after we got sick.

Texas Health Resources gave the paper a statement saying: 'Nina Pham bravely served Texas Health Dallas during a most difficult time. We continue to support and wish the best for her, and we remain optimistic that constructive dialogue can resolve this matter.'

However her attorney Charla Aldous said she was simply used as a 'PR pawn'. 

Protective: Her dog Bentley was placed in quarantine for 21 days but she says many people commented that he should have been put down just in case

During an interview in December, just six weeks after she was declared Ebola-free, the modest nurse insists she is not a hero and was 'just doing [her] job'.

She was among the Ebola fighters recognized by Time magazine as their 'Person of the Year'. 

Miss Pham recalled a CDC doctor and her chief nursing officer approaching her in hazmat suits - and she knew from their faces the news was bad.

Her dog Bentley was placed in quarantine for 21 days but she says many people commented that he should have been put down just in case.

She adds people have been afraid of her, including not wanting to shake her hand in church, even after health officials declared her free of the virus. 

President Barack Obama tried to calm hysteria in the United States over how Ebola is contracted by welcoming survivors to the White House.

After surviving her ordeal, Ms Pham was welcomed to the Oval Office in October and hugged by the President.

The worst ever Ebola outbreak has left more than 6,300 people dead worldwide, nearly all in Sierra Leone, Guinea and Liberia.
