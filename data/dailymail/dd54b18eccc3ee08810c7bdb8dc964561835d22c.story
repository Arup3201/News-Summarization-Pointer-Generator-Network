A toilet has gone on sale in West London for £150,000 - more than half the price of an average house in the UK.

The loo, believed to be Britain's most expensive ever, is located in a small store room between two floors in a commercial building in Kensington, opposite one of Britain's priciest streets.

For the same price you could buy a new-build family home with four bedrooms in industrial towns such as Stockton-on-Tees.

On sale: A toilet located between the first and second floors of this building on High Street Kensington is set to go up for auction with a guide price of £150,000

£150,000 could even get you a two-bedroom holiday home, complete with swimming pool, on the Costa del Sol.

The tiny property, billed as a 'store room with WC and wash basin' has no bedrooms, no reception rooms, no garden and just one window.

It is reached from a stairwell which goes between the first and second floors of a red-brick building which has a cafe on its ground floor.

The main selling point of the £150,000 toilet is its location on Kensington High Street, only a minute's walk from Hyde Park.

The area is favoured by wealthy Arabs
 and Russians, including Chelsea owner Roman Abramovich, who lives 
opposite on Kensington Palace Gardens.

Property auctioneers Allsop are selling the toilet at auction tomorrow.

The
 listing for the property says: 'Local shops and amenities are readily 
available along fashionable Kensington High Street and Kensington Church
 Street to include numerous restaurants, boutique shops and antique 
shops.

'Kensington High
 Street Underground station (District Line) is available to the west and
 the open spaces of Hyde Park are within walking distance to the east.'

While the room appears too small for anyone actually to live in, it is possible that an entrepreneur could run an office there in order to benefit from the prestigious location.

Dragon's Den star James Caan opened his first office in Mayfair even though it was so small it was impossible to open the door fully, so he could impress potential investors with the address of his business.

The average house in Britain is currently priced at around £240,000, but so-called 'super-prime' properties in Central London have been spiralling upwards in recent years.

Even elsewhere in London, it would be possible to buy a two-bedroom flat in a suburban area for the £150,000 that is the toilet's guide price.

Two-bedroom flat in outer London: A ground-floor flat in Plaistow, East London is currently listed for sale for £150,000.

It has a private garden and a living room as well as two bedrooms, a bathroom and kitchen.

Three-bedroom house in Newcastle: A detached house on the outskirts of Newcastle is on sale for £150,000, with a living room, dining room, garage and two gardens.

Three-bedroom cottage in the Highlands: A stone house set in beautiful countryside near the north coast of Scotland is available for £150,000.

Four-bedroom holiday home in Spain: A semi-detached villa in Andalusia with a private swimming pool, just half an hour from the beach, could be yours for €175,000 (approximately £150,000).
