Just another small town lawyer... Former presidential candidate John Edwards pictured out on a date with his new partner in Chapel Hill, NC

John Edwards has returned to his old profession as a personal injury lawyer after two failed bids for the Oval Office and a political career ruined by a sex scandal and fraud trial.

The disgraced former Senator from North Carolina is to rejoin his former law partner David Kirby to set up shop in his home state's capital Raleigh.

His eldest daughter Cate will also be joining the business, which will practice under the name Edwards Kirby.

And despite the ignominious end to his political career, Mr Edwards will not quite break links with the nation's capital: Edwards Kirby will have a satellite office in Washington DC.

Mr Edwards has kept a low profile since he was acquitted of campaign finance charges last year, but he was last week caught on camera with the new woman in his life after ending his relationship with the mistress at the centre of that trial.

He has reportedly been dating a single mother nearly half his age for about a year and the woman has gotten close with his family.

The National Enquirer reported that Danielle King was spotted going on a date to a local Italian restaurant with Mr Edwards after first meeting with him at his home in Chapel Hill, North Carolina.

The couple arrived separately at the restaurant and kept a distance from each other when they left. However while inside, their closeness was evident to other diners.

'They were very smiley and absolutely engrossed in conversation. They gazed into each other's eyes as if they were the only two people on the planet,' an unidentified source told the tabloid magazine of their meal at Panzanella.

The 35-year-old has reportedly become a fixture at the home Mr Edwards shares with his young children.

The 60-year-old is now solely responsible for raising his teenage children Emma Claire, 15, and Jack, 13, following his wife Elizabeth's death to cancer in 2010.

Ms King, who has a son of her own, has reportedly become a maternal figure in the Edwards home, with the Inquirer reporting that she has watched the children when 'Johnny' has had to go out of town.

Finding love with a home town girl has come at the right moment for Mr Edwards, who was also fortunate in that his former law partner found himself in need of a new team.

Mr Kirby was senior partner for the Kirby & Holt law firm in Raleigh, his colleague Mark Holt struck out with attorney Dave Sherlin to open their own law firm last week, WRAL.com reported.

So now Edwards Kirby rides again, and Cate Edwards and her law partner Sharon Eubanks will also join the new firm.

Speaking her father's new venture, Ms Edwards told WRAL.com: 'His life's mission, I think, has been to help people. Edwards Kirby is founded for that purpose – to give people a voice, to give the disenfranchised a voice.'

Mr Edwards added in a statement: 'It is a privilege to practice again, and we want to take on cases that, through litigation, change social inequalities in favor of the greater good.

'In building Edwards Kirby, we sought a team that has championed the causes of economic and social equality in court and in hundreds of communities across the country.'

Mr Edwards's return to the legal profession comes just a year after he was sat on the wrong side of the dock during his trial over accusations he defrauded his own campaign's finances to hide his affair.

Prosecutors accused the former presidential-candidate of funnelling cash pledged to the 2008 race to an aide to keep mistress Rielle Hunter out of the public eye.

But after a month-and-a-half of having his private life exposed in court, a federal jury eventually found Mr Edwards not guilty on one count and couldn't reach a decision on six others.

But the damage was nonetheless severe. The court heard as lawyers recounted the most intimate details of Mr Edwards’s affair with former campaign videographer Rielle Hunter, with whom the then-married presidential candidate fathered a daughter, wife his wife Elizabeth was batting cancer.

Since the highly publicised trial, Mr Edwards has shunned public attention and lived quietly at his North Carolina home, a sprawling gated estate outside Chapel Hill.

Mr Edwards and Mr Kirby have known each other since law school; along Mr Edwards's late wife they both attended the University of North Carolina at Chapel Hill in the Seventies.

Mr Kirby said of the new venture that they saw it as a chance to 'help those people who need it most.'
