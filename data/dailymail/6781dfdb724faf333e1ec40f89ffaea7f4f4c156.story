The Mighty Mights of Wallkill, New York, became the laughing stock of the peewee football world when a parent posted video of the entire team getting sacked by a victory banner and it became a national sensation. 

Late night host Jimmy Fallon took pity on the pint-sized players gave them do-over on NBC's 'The Tonight Show' on Wednesday.

This time, it was a smashing success. 

'We're actually wanted to bring them on the show, give them a shot at redemption by successfully breaking through a banner, but getting the team here would be pretty much impossible... but here at the Tonight Show, we like to make the impossible possible,' Fallon quipped.

Beating the banner: The Mighty Mites of Wallkill, New York, busted through a banner on the Jimmy Fallon show after their failure on the field became a YouTube sensation

Disaster waiting to happen: The Mighty Mites  hit a wall when they ran into a victory banner that was meant to burst in half with their force

The players burst through the paper-thin banner with no trouble, then handed Fallon his own Mighty Mites jersey. 

That's not what happened the first time they tried. The first banner resulted in a hilarious pile-on as player after player hit the banner like it's a brick wall.

The two mothers who were holding the banner refused to let go, even as they watched the 5- and 6-year-olds of the Mighty Mites stumble head-first into disaster.

The scene was meant to re-create the dramatic entrances of NFL teams who burst through paper banners to enter the field.

Pint-sized cheerleaders even lined the path to cheer on the conquering players. 

By the end, though, all of them were in a heap and their cheer squad was reduced to giggles.

One even jumped with joy at the spectacle. 

The parent who posted the video on YouTube revealed that the hilarious moment came after the team's first home game. 

They won 24-0.
