A Chinese student has staged a 'rehearsal' for her own funeral because she didn't want to miss the chance the festivities.

Zeng Jia forked out her savings on an elaborate service complete with flowers, photographers and a full crowd of mourners.

But the 22-year-old says the bizarre experience was not morbid - in fact, it has given her a more positive outlook on life.

Speech: The student delivered a eulogy at her wake in front of a crowd of mourners

Ms Zeng spent an hour lying motionless in a coffin decorated with flowers, clutching a Hello Kitty doll to her chest as origami doves hung above the casket.

She paid a team of make-up artists who specialise in working on dead bodies to make her look realistic.

A man dressed in military uniform stood guard over the 'corpse' as friends and family filed past the coffin during the ceremony in the city of Wuhan.

'It struck me that people spend all that time and effort on someone when they are gone and they cannot appreciate it,' she said after the service.

'I wanted to see what people would think of me so I decided to hold my funeral while I could enjoy it.'

After lying in state, Ms Zeng jumped out of the coffin and attended her wake, where she delivered a speech.

While the decision to stage her own funeral may be considered bizarre by most, the adventurous woman insists she has no regrets about the experience.

'Experiencing death has made me appreciate life more keenly,' she said. 'I feel so good living after coming out of the coffin.'
