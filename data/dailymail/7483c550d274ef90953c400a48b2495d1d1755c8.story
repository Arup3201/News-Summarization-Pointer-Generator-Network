Winston Churchill planned to tempt America into joining World War Two by offering the country a priceless copy of the Magna Carta.

The British Cabinet believed the gesture would sway US public opinion in favour of joining the fighting in Europe, and even set a date for the handover before the deal fell through.

Never-before-seen letters reveal the wartime government discussed how Americans are desperate for 'tangible evidence of their European background', meaning the gift would be of particular value.

Letters written in 1941 reveal Churchill planned to gift the US a copy of the Magna Carta to persuade them to join World War Two, noting that Americans desire 'tangible evidence of their European background'

The Magna Carta, which was issued by King John in 1215 establishing the rule of law and handing rights to his subjects, is also seen as a precursor to the American Constitution.

In 1941, when the letters were written, a copy of the document was stranded in America following the outbreak of the war while it was on display at the New York World's Fair in 1939.

The US government had already signed a deal sending vast amounts of aid money over to their struggling allies in Europe, but were still reticent about engaging in the fighting themselves.

According to the letters, which go on display at the British Library from this Friday, the Americans saw the British as 'cold-blooded', 'calculating' people who failed 'to say it with flowers'

In an attempt to win them over, the British Cabinet, supported by Churchill, planned to gift them the copy of the Magna Carta, which belonged to Lincoln Cathedral.

The letters, reported in The Independent, say: 'A friendly act, graciously performed, evokes a tremendous response; when an American has his emotions stirred, his generosity is unbounded.

'He will give the shirt off his back for friendship.'

Officials even scheduled June 15 of that year as the day for the document to be handed over, but the deal fell through for unspecified reasons.

Magna Carta: Law, Liberty, Legacy is on display at the British Library from Friday until September 1. Adult tickets cost £12 and can be purchased here
