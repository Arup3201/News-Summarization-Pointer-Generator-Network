Michael Carrick may be relaxing on holiday for the time being but the Manchester United midfielder's summer could be about to get a lot more hectic.

Carrick is in with a chance of being promoted from the standby list to Roy Hodgson's England squad, should Alex Oxlade-Chamberlain fail to recover from an injury that seemingly shattered the Arsenal midfielder's World Cup dream.

Oxlade-Chamberlain limped off in the 63rd minute of the feisty 2-2 affair with Ecuador after Carlos Gruezo rolled on to the 20-year-old's foot.
