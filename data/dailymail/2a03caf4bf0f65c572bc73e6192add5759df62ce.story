What came first, the chicken or the egg? 

The question has puzzled scientists for centuries - but it appears a British businessman might have cracked the age-old riddle.

Simon Steer, from Culmstock, Devon, put an egg into a frying pan and was shocked to find it had formed the shape of a chicken.

Cracked it: Businessman Simon Steer, from Culmstock, Devon was cooking breakfast and looked down at the pan to see his home-grown egg had formed the shape of a chicken, pictured

Amused: Mr Steer said his wife Rosie and his 12-year-old daughter Devin were in fits of laughter when he showed them the likeness. Above, Mr and Mrs Steer with a chicken and an egg in their kitchen

The yolk spread out to make the hen's head and feathered chest, while the egg white formed the rest of the body - with a stray drop forming the bird's leg. 

Mr Steer said his wife Rosie and his 12-year-old daughter Devin were in fits of laughter when he showed them the likeness.

He said: 'We breed hens, so breakfast is usually eggs and bacon with a cup of tea.

'I was just making breakfast, I went to break my egg into the pan and lo and behold the chicken formation happened.

'I said, come have a look at this, by which point everyone rushed over and we were in fits of laughter, it was very amusing.

'We didn't show anyone to start with, it was just bizarre and one of those odd things that happens.' 

Divine breakfast: This is not the first time people have spotted figures appearing in their breakfast. A number of people have photographed the face of Jesus in their toast. The one above was sold on eBay

He later uploaded the image to Twitter as part of a competition being run by butcher chain Lloyd Maunder as part of National Breakfast Week. 

But this is not the first time people have spotted figures appearing in their breakfasts.

A number of people have reported seeing Jesus' face inexplicably burned into their toast, and one mother found him on the lid of her Marmite jar.

While one decade-old cheese sandwich bearing the likeness of the Virgin Mary was sold to an online casino in 2004 for £15,000. 

Jesus has apparently also appeared in a baby scan in August 2006, in the bottom of a U.S. couple's frying pan in February 2005, and on a fish finger in Canada in November 2004.

And in 2011, one man was about to butter his toast when he spotted the likeness of Al Qaeda leader Osama Bin Laden.
