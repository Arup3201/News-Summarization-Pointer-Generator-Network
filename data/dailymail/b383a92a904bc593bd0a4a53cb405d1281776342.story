Hull City will finally complete a move for Andrew Robertson next week after agreeing a Â£3m fee with Dundee United for the young full-back.

The Scotland left back has been the subject of offers from West Ham and interest from Everton this summer, but Steve Bruce has made four bids so far and believes the fifth has finally sealed the deal.

Robertson joined United in June 2013 from Queens Park and has developed at a rapid pace winning the PFA Young Player of the Year award in Scotland last season.

The 20-year-old also made his international bow in a friendly against Poland in March this year.

Hull have already strengthened their squad this summer with the signings of Tom Ince, Robert Snodgrass and the permanent acquisition of Jake Livermore who spent last season on loan at the club.

But Bruce is eager to keep adding depth to his squad as he prepares to combine the rigours of Premier League football with the Europa League.
