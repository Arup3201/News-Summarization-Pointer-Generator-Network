Murder suspect Shrien Dewani will stand trial in October for plotting to kill his new bride after a panel of psychiatric experts ruled that he was mentally fit.

The 34-year-old businessman, who denies any involvement, lost a lengthy battle against extradition to South Africa in April after claiming to be too traumatised and depressed to face justice. 

But mental health experts in the country unanimously agreed Dewani was well enough to be tried for wife Anni’s abduction and murder during their honeymoon in 2010 after observing him for 30 days.

Shrien Dewani, who appeared in court today, was told he is now fit to stand trial for the alleged murder of his wife. He has been behind bars in South Africa since being extradited from Britain earlier this year and was seen in May at the Valkenberg Hospital, a secure psychiatric hospital in Cape Town. He was returning from the grocery story when the picture was taken.

Anni’s sister Ami Denborg, who lives in Sweden, yesterday welcomed the news, saying it was a ‘step in the right direction’.

She said: ‘It’s a relief for all of us. We’ve been waiting quite a long time for this.

‘I
 know this autumn is going to be tough for us but we still want the 
trial to start so that we can get the information we need.

‘We can get to know what really happened. It feels like we’re moving forward.’

Dewani’s
 parents and brother attended yesterday’s brief hearing at which 
prosecutor Rodney de Kock told the Cape Town High Court: ‘The accused is
 not mentally ill. The accused is not certifiable.’

Dewani, who was dressed in a dark suit and tie, seemed less confused than at his two previous appearances.

He did not speak, but nodded to acknowledge that he had understood.

Anni, 28, was murdered in November 2010 after the couple’s taxi was held up on the edge of a township.

 was released unharmed, but Anni’s body was found the next day in the

Shrien Dewani speaks to another patient at the Valkenberg Hospital, in Cape Town, where he was held since his extradition from the UK in April, for psychiatric tests. He was told today that they show he is fit to stand trial for the honeymoon murder of his new bride, Anni.

Before his extradition, Dewani was detained in a hospital in Britain for depression and post-traumatic stress disorder

He
 was arrested and a lengthy legal battle ensued, during which Dewani’s 
lawyers claimed he was too unwell to travel and would not receive a fair
 trial in South Africa.

The case is set to be heard on October 6, when Dewani will face charges relating to kidnapping, robbery and murder.

He will continue to be held at the Valkenberg psychiatric hospital in the meantime.Three men have already been convicted over Anni’s murder, who all implicated Dewani in plotting it.
