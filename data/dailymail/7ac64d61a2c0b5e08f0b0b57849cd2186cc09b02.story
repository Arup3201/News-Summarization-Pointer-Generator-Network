An elderly who was shot by police during the manhunt for LAPD officer Christopher Dorner have refused a replacement truck after the force asked them to pose for publicity photographs. 

Emma Hernandez, 71, was shot twice in the neck and her daughter Margie Carranza suffered wounds from shattered glass as police shot at their Toyota Tacoma more than 100 times.

LAPD Chief Charlie Beck promised to 
replace the truck after it was left riddled with bullet holes in the 
'case of mistaken identity' on February 7 but more than a month later it had not been delivered.

Emma Hernandez was hit twice in the neck after police shot her pick-up truck more than 100 times. The LAPD promised a replacement but wanted publicity photos taken and for her to pay tax on the vehicle

Mrs Hernandez, 71, pictured in an ambulance was mistaken for accused cop-killer Christopher Dorner

Mrs Hernandez's attorney Glen Jonas said the women no longer want it after the force asked them to pose for photographs and pay income tax on the truck by filling out a 1099 form.

He told NBClosangeles: 'You tried to murder the woman, now 
you're telling her she can't have a four-wheel drive, you're telling her
she can't sell it and you've got to be taxed on it?'

He said the truck - valued at $32,560 - was being treated as a 'reward or prize' instead of a gesture of compensation.

He added that Mrs Hernandez is still suffering complications after she was hit twice in the neck by police.

She was shot as about eight officers protecting the home of a department captain and his family who had been included on Dorner's list opened fire.

Dorner died on February 12 during a police shootout after a nine-day manhunt.

He was accused of killing the daughter and future son-in-law of former LAPD Captain Randy Quan, 
who defended him at the disciplinary hearing where he was expelled from 
the police force.

Mrs Hernandez's daughter Margie Carranza was also injured in the shooting

The truck is worth about $32,000 and attorney Glen Jonas said they would file a government claim

He also allegedly killed a 34-year-old police trainer and three further police personnel were shot
and wounded while he was on the loose, and another died in the final 
siege at the ski resort of Big Bear.

Police shot Mrs Hernandez on February 7 as she delivered newspapers in her aqua blue Toyota Tacoma.

Despite the fact police were looking for Dorner's gray Nissan Titan they still opened fire. 

Mr Jonas said after the shooting: 'This was two petite Latina women 
versus a large black man, with a different vehicle, different color. The
police didn't take the time to do the identification.

'They didn't 
give the "suspect" the opportunity to surrender. So the whole thing was
just mishandled, and we expect that the city will acknowledge that and 
go from there.'

Former police officer Christopher Dorner died last month in a police shootout after a nine-day manhunt

Christopher Dorner died at a cabin, which then burned down, near Angelus Oaks, California, on February 13 during a shootout with LAPD officers after a nine-day manhunt

LAPD Cmdr. Andrew Smith says the department's Chief 
Charlie Beck met the women in their home to 
apologize and tell them he had arranged for someone to donate a new 
pickup truck.

However more than a month later no truck has been delivered and Mr Jonas said they will file a government claim - the precursor to a lawsuit against a government agency.

Cmdr Smith told NBC: 'It's really sad for us because we want to help these women move on with their lives, and help them move forward with that, we just can't get past the 1099 issue.

'The government has to take their bite out of it, I guess.'

The eight officers involved in the shooting have been put on 'non-field assignments' for the time-being.
