Patrick Rock, a key advisor to the Prime Minister, has been arrested on suspicion of child porn offences

One of David Cameron's closest aides has resigned after being arrested on child pornography allegations.

Patrick Rock has been closely involved in drawing up Government policy on internet porn filters.

He quit after the Prime Minister learned he was at the centre of a police probe over images of child abuse.

Detectives from the National Crime 
Agency searched No 10 and examined IT systems and offices used by Mr 
Rock, deputy director of the Downing Street policy unit.

Mr
 Rock was a protege of Margaret Thatcher and has held a series of senior
 posts in the Conservative Party. He has been close to Mr Cameron for 
many years.

Described as 
the Prime Minister's 'policy fixer', the unmarried 62-year-old had been 
tipped as a leading contender for a Conservative peerage only weeks ago.

His
 arrest and resignation from Downing Street, where he has worked since 
2011, will send shockwaves through the party's high command. The Prime 
Minister is said to be 'extremely shocked'.

A friend said: 'He has known Patrick for a long time and never expected anything like this.'

Mr
 Rock was arrested last month after officials at No 10 were made aware 
of a 'potential offence relating to child abuse imagery', Mr Cameron's 
spokesman told the Daily Mail.

One well-placed source said Mr Rock 
had also been the subject of a sexual harassment complaint from a civil 
servant working in Downing Street, which is understood to have been 
passed to Mr Cameron's chief of staff Ed Llewellyn.

'There
 were accusations against him that didn't turn into a formal process. 
That has upset some people at No 10,' the source said.

Mr Cameron's relationship with Mr Rock goes back to the Home Office, where they both worked under Michael Howard in the 1990s.

Mr
 Rock, who has repeatedly tried to become an MP, is known in Westminster
 for coining the phrase 'Cows moo, dogs bark, Labour puts up taxes' used
 by the Tories in the 1970s.

The Prime Minister brought him back 
into Downing Street in 2011, a move welcomed by critics as heralding the
 return of a 'grown up' to the centre of government.

In
 the No 10 policy unit, he has taken a particular responsibility for 
home affairs issues and has also been involved in drawing up the 
Government's measures against internet pornography and child abuse 
imagery.

Google and other search engines introduced changes that will prevent depraved images from being listed in results for more than 100,000 searches after Government pressure

In a crusade 
spearheaded by the Prime Minister, Downing Street brokered a deal with 
internet firms which means that all 20million households connected to 
the internet are being contacted and asked whether they want 
family-friendly filters installed.

Downing Street also persuaded Google and other search engines to introduce changes that will prevent depraved images from being listed in results for more than 100,000 searches.

Downing Street confirmed that Mr Rock, who lives in West London, had been involved in the policy.

'The Prime Minister believes that child 
abuse imagery is abhorrent and that anyone involved with it should be 
properly dealt with under the law.'

Downing Street spokesman

'Patrick
 Rock was one of a number of advisers and officials involved in dealing 
with this issue – but the work was led by somebody else, and decisions 
were taken by ministers,' a spokesman said.

'On the evening of February 12, Downing Street was first made aware of a potential offence relating to child abuse imagery. It was immediately referred to the National Crime Agency.

'The Prime Minister was immediately informed and kept updated throughout. Patrick Rock was arrested at his home in the early hours of February 13, a few hours after Downing Street had reported the matter.

'Subsequently, we arranged for officers to come into No 10 and have access to all IT systems and offices they considered relevant.

'This is an ongoing investigation so it would not be appropriate to comment further, but the Prime Minister believes that child abuse imagery is abhorrent and that anyone involved with it should be properly dealt with under the law.'

The spokesman denied suggestions that colleagues in No 10 had been told Mr Rock was 'off sick', but only the Prime Minister and a handful of his most senior officials appear to have been told the reason for his absence.

Downing Street refused to comment on the allegation of sexual harassment, but insisted: 'All complaints are dealt with very seriously and are dealt with appropriately.'

Oxford-educated Patrick Rock comes from a noble background

By 
 Tom Kelly and James Chapman

Born Patrick Robert John Rock de 
Besombes to a family of European aristocrats, he has worked for leading 
Tories for four decades.

But
 despite his impeccable social and political contacts, Oxford-educated 
Rock has repeatedly failed in his ambition to become a Conservative MP, 
despite being selected to fight safe seats.

Rock,
 62 and unmarried, lives in a £500,000 flat in Parsons Green, West 
London. He was born in Kensington in 1951, a year after the marriage of 
his mother Gertrud and Egyptian-born father Robert John Rock de 
Besombes.

His paternal grandmother was a D'aigneaux, from a noble French family that originated in Normandy and boasts a coat of arms.

As
 a teenager, Rock boarded at the elite Jesuit Stonyhurst College in 
Lancashire, winning a scholarship to Worcester College, Oxford, where he
 studied history.

After 
graduation he worked as Margaret Thatcher's political correspondence 
secretary in the then Prime Minister's Office and also as managing 
director of the Retail Consortium.

It
 is not clear when he shortened his name to plain Patrick Rock, but he 
used it while fighting the Woolwich East election in 1979, aged 28, 
which he lost despite increasing the Tory vote.

After
 losing Crewe and Nantwich in the 1983 election he was selected in a 
by-election to defend the seemingly impregnable safe seat of Portsmouth 
South in 1984, which had a Tory majority of over 12,000.

The
 Portsmouth News described him as 'Mrs Thatcher's protege' who had been 
hand-picked by Downing Street to contest the seat ahead of more 
impressive local candidates.

During
 the campaign he was described as 'likeable and energetic but slightly 
wet behind the ears'. His campaign went catastrophically wrong after he 
spoke on TV about a hospital that was not in the constituency.

Rock
 was unconcerned, declaring at a public meeting that he was 'absolutely 
certain' he would win the seat, predicting Labour would finish second 
and the Liberal SDP Alliance trail in third.

But
 after a 14 per cent swing against him, he was defeated by the 
Alliance's Mike Hancock in what was labelled the 'biggest election upset
 for years' and a 'great surprise' to Mrs Thatcher.

Newspaper reports described the defeated Rock leaving the count 'pale with shock'.

He
 blamed the defeat on too many Conservatives staying at home and Mrs 
Thatcher phoned him the following morning to assure him the defeat was 
not his fault. The following year, he was appointed to the Conservative 
Research Department.

He 
later worked as special adviser to Cabinet ministers in the Department 
of the Environment and then the Home Office, where he met David Cameron.
 The pair are famously said to have repaired to the Two Chairmen pub on 
the day of the death in 1994 of Labour leader John Smith, where they 
agreed Tony Blair would take over, leaving their party 'f*****'.

Rock again attempted to become an MP in 1990, applying for the safe Tory seat of Devizes, but failed to be selected.

He
 also worked in Brussels for EU Commissioner Chris Patten, with the 
responsibility for the western Balkans, before becoming a policy adviser
 at Downing Street.

Colleagues
 describe him as 'abrasive' and 'a commentator rather an a doer'. 
Another said his arrest over child abuse images was a 'terrific shock'.
