One of the pleasures of travel is getting to sample the local cuisine. 

But would you tuck in to a developing duck embryo straight from the egg in southeast Asia? Or sip fermented mare's milk in Mongolia? Perhaps a warming bowl of dog soup in Korea? 

Laura Siciliano-Rosen, co-founder of Eat Your World, a guide to local foods around the globe, says: 'Tasting the locally distinct foods and drinks of a place is absolutely essential to a trip, as they illuminate that region’s unique culture, history, geography, and lore. And seeking those foods out inevitably brings a traveler into closer contact with the local people, allowing for a richer travel experience.'   

Extra protein? Shirako, which translates as 'white children' is a Japanese dish made of male fish genitalia containing sperm

But not everything on the international menu screams 'eat me'.  In Mexico, spicy grasshoppers, known as chapulines, are a popular snack on sale at the market stalls of Oaxaca, while tacos de sesos - that's beef brain tacos to you and me, are a well-loved treat (which comes with a Bovine spongiform encephalopathy - or mad-cow disease - warming).

Feeling thirsty in Mongolia? The local tipple, aireg, is a fermented, alcoholic dairy drink traditionally made from mare's milk. And snake wine  is the drink du jour in China, Vietnam and southeast Asia. Produced by infusing whole snakes in rice wine or grain alcohol, the drink was once believed to have medicinal qualities.  

There's something fishy about the Swedes' national delicacy. Surströmming, is bulging tinned herring. Why does it bulge? Because inside the fish is slowly festering. And Greenland's offering, Kaestur Hakarl, is fermented shark.

Popular South Asian delicacy, balut, is a ready-to-hatch duck embryo that is half-boiled and eaten in the shell. Yum?

'As for how to go about finding these foods: A little pre-trip research goes a long way,' says Siciliano-Rosen.

'But on the ground, it's as simple as asking people where they eat and what their city is known for. Ask your cab driver, your waiter, the person next to you on the metro-anyone. And keep your eyes open - you can probably guess where locals versus tourists are eating by the look of a place (and, often, the prices on the menu). 

Southest Asia is a hotbed of interesting edibles. Deep fried chicken feet are a popular street food in China, Indonesia, Korea and Malaysia. Balut, is a developing duck embryo that is boiled and eaten in the shell - a favourite in the Philippines. Boshintang, found commonly in Korea, is also known as dog meat soup.

Shirako, which translates as 'white children' is a Japanese dish of male fish genitalia containing sperm. In Venezuela, the meat of the largest rodent in the world - the capybara - is a popular dish. Closer to home, there's the humble haggis: a savoury pudding containing sheep's heart, liver and lungs, traditionally cooked in the animal's stomach.

Deep fried chicken feet anyone? Fowl extremities are common all over Asia, but would you indulge? 

But beware of Korean delicacy, Sannakji, which consists of live small octopus and is best served still wriggling. The sucker pads on each squirming tentacle have been known to stick to the inside of diners' throats.

Siciliano-Rosen adds: 'When trying new foods, especially if it's from the street, use caution. Of course, be wary of anything made with tap water, including ice, unless you’re sure it’s safe to drink; same goes with raw, unpeeled produce. 

'Choose established venues, or eat where lots of locals are eating, particularly women and children. Always wash your hands before eating; in some countries, carrying hand sanitizer or your own utensils is a good idea. And before you travel, check that your vaccinations are up-to-date.'

Super carb Cassava is a shrub commonly found in South America, and a great source of carbohydrates - but if it isn't prepared properly it can contain enough cyanide to kill you.

In Nambia, the Giant Bullfrog is a delicacy, but they're only safe to eat after the mating season. Eating at the wrong time of year could result in  you kidney failure.

Blood clams are considered a delicacy in China. But not cooking them properly can result in hepatitis A, E, thyphoid, and dysentery. 

When the Ackee, the national fruit of Jamaica, is unripe, its seeds are poisonous and can result in potentially deadly Jamaican vomiting sickness.

Japanese dish, Fugu, or pufferfish, contains deadly amounts of the poison tetrodotoxin. Chefs leave just the right amount of poison in to give the diner a tingling sensation on the tongue. 

Tacos de sesos, or brain tacos, a delicacy in Mexico has a spongy texture, which is not entirely popular with tourists
