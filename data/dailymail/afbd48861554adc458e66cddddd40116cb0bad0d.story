Lord Robert Winston has accused the BBC of failing the public by dumbing down its programming and warned the corporation he may choose to make future programmes with rival broadcasters.

The Labour peer, a fertility expert who presented the Bafta-winning series The Human Body, accused the BBC of underrating the ability of the public to take an interest in hard-hitting scientific material.

He told viewers of a Times Educational Supplement webchat that the corporation was hampering people's ability to properly engage with issues like nuclear power and climate change by not giving them the facts.

Attack: Lord Robert Winston has accused the BBC of failing to educate the public on hard hitting scientific issues like climate change and nuclear power

'The public, first of all, are massively underrated. The public are perfectly capable of understanding really difficult issues, but if they are not given the tools for understanding it becomes a problem.'

He said BBC managers had been reluctant to commission programmes he had suggested on climate change, presenting science he believed would change the 'emphasis' of the debate on the issue.

'They seem to think that they have to pursue viewing figures but actually if you get something that is interesting and well-made, people will watch it,' he added.

Elsewhere in the interview, Professor Winston accuses of the BBC of dumbing down the quality of its science broadcasting in order to attract more viewers.

'One of the things that worries me is that very often now the BBC makes these programmes that they claim are inspiring about science but actually half the time the science that you watch or listen to is unintelligible,' he said.

Britain’s nuclear expansion plans have been boosted after Japanese engineering giant Hitachi signed a £700 million deal that will enable it to start building the next generation of power plants.

The engineering giant is buying Horizon Nuclear Power - which has the rights to build reactors at Wylfa on Anglesey, North Wales, and Oldbury in Gloucestershire - from its German owners E.ON and RWE npower.

In what it described as the start of a 100-year commitment to the UK, Hitachi confirmed that it intends to progress Horizon’s plans to build between two and three new nuclear plants at each site.

'It's not very well explained and I think that that's rather shocking that our leading broadcaster has not really got that firmly under its belt.'

It is not the first time that Professor Winston has criticised the BBC for shying away from pursuing serious scientific programming. In 2008 he said then-director general Mark Thompson shows a lack of 'spine' in his leadership, particularly over the resignation of BBC1 controller Peter Fincham over misleading footage of the Queen.

He added at the time that the corporation's decision to shift towards entertainment and away from heavier subjects was 'a massive error of judgement' that would come back to haunt it.

And last year he told the Daily Mail he was so fed up with 'the chaos and disorganisation' at the broadcaster that he was considering quitting and pitching future programme ideas to a commercial channel.

He spoke of his fury over the BBC's treatment of his series Child Of Our Time, which focuses on a group of children born in 2000 and follows the influences that shape their personality as they grow up.  According to Professor Winston, producers were no longer filming — and at a crucial time when the children were reaching the brink of adolescence.

‘They have stopped filming the series, and by leaving it in the lurch as we reach the adolescent stage, it negates all we have done before,’ the peer told Mail columnist Richard Kay at the Chelsea Flower Show.

‘I have had talks with senior executive producers, but I’ve got nowhere. This hurts me emotionally.

‘It is part of the BBC’s remit to educate the public with programmes like this. It isn’t as if it is an expensive series, so any budgetary concerns seem like an excuse. And OK, it’s not The  X Factor, but it has very healthy audience figures for a programme of this kind.’
