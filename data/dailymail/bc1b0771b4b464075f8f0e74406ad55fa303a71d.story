The Arctic weather looks set to continue as forecasters warn temperatures could stay below average for most of March.

The UK was feeling the chill today as parts of Britain faced temperatures colder than Moscow.

The mercury plunged to -3C in Aberdeenshire and the bitter weather remains colder than the Russian capital, which is enjoying 1C.

And it looks like Spring - due to officially start on March 1 -  could also be on the back- burner, as the Met Office warns much of the next month will also be colder than usual.

And last night in Loch Glascarnoch, in Scotland, temperatures dipped to  -7.6C overnight. Moscow experienced lows of -6C.

The weekend saw temperatures of -4C 
(25F) in the north of England, with several inches of snow falling along
the eastern coast, blown in by the so-called ‘Beast from the East’ 
weather system.

Despite the chill, party goers in Newcastle braved 
the icy pavements dressed only in high heels and skimpy dresses over the
weekend, without an extra layer in sight.

The changing of the seasons will be greeted with snow flurries and frosts, forecasters have warned.

The Met Office, which considers March 1
as the first day of spring, also warned there could be more of the snow
that hit the east of the country over the weekend, as the mercury 
hovered just above freezing in most areas.

February's full moon, which will be visible tonight, has long been dubbed the 'Snow Moon', because February was often the snowiest month of the year, particularly in America.

But the chilly weather seems to have finally taken it out of him as he retires to a branch to try and get some shut-eye

The Met Office has issued a yellow alert level two - 
which is triggered to let health and social care providers know when 
there is a risk that extreme weather could affect services.

It
said: 'During Monday, although still feeling very cold across southern 
areas in strong winds at times, less cold air is expected to move in, 
allowing temperatures to recover somewhat.

'Further
north, the cold conditions are expected to hang on, although colder 
night time minima may be offset by sunnier periods by day. There is a 
risk of icy conditions at times, especially across the north.'

A spokesman added: 'The below average temperatures look likely to last throughout March.

'Although generally temperatures are expected to rise, they are going to be likely to be below average for the month.'

Despite the cold weather over the past week there has been no frost because the clouds covering the UK have acted as a blanket, the Met Office has said.

While much of the UK has 'felt much colder than any other time this winter', there has not been the right 'ingredients' for a long hard frost.

It said: 'For a classic frosty night we need a few ingredients: low temperatures, clear skies, calm winds and moisture.

'A clear, calm night gives excellent radiation conditions – by this we mean that the heat absorbed by the Earth’s surface during the day escapes readily back into space and allows temperatures to fall.

'If the temperature falls to the dew point (the temperature to which air must cool for it to become saturated with water vapour) moisture will condense and form droplets on the ground’s surface. When temperatures fall below freezing the droplets freeze and we get frost.'

It said thick cloud cover was stopping temperatures from falling too much below freezing. 

It said: 'The wind is also important as it mixes the lower part of our atmosphere. Rather than having cold air pooling in one place and causing low temperatures, the wind can bring less cold air from another location or even bring it down from the upper atmosphere.

'This also helps to keep temperatures from falling too low. However, easterly winds this week have certainly made it feel very cold indeed!'

These girls were seemingly oblivious to the freezing temperatures as they enjoyed a night out in Newcastle

Chilly: The whole country was 
feeling the chill as flurries of snow drift in from the east

Today there is likely to be more snow  across England and Wales, with 
areas of  high ground, especially in the South East, most at risk.

Temperatures will be slightly warmer, 
with highs of 7C (45F) in the North and 6C (43F) in the South, but high 
winds from the East will make the temperature feel more like -1C (30F) 
or -2C (28F).

Met Office forecaster Charlie Powell 
said: ‘Cold weather looks to continue through much of the next week, 
with brisk winds in the South accentuating the cold.

‘We could see a few snow flurries from
time to time, particularly across the East. Overnight temperatures will
fall to -3C (27F).’

Laura Caldwell of MeteoGroup said: 
‘Long term, looking into March it’s unlikely we’ll get any warmer 
spring-like weather any time soon. This is because of the north-westerly
winds blowing down from the Arctic, which look likely to persist.’
