Plans for a 4,000-seater stadium in the exclusive Sandbanks resort in Dorset has sparked uproar among its furious millionaire residents.

The £12million arena, which would host beach sports like volleyball and football, would be on prime development land in what is one of the most expensive places to live in the UK outside of London.

Property developer and former Bournemouth FC chairman, Eddie Mitchell, is behind the project, which will include shops, beach studios, restaurants, offices and a 450-space car park.

The millionaire residents of Sandbanks have expressed their fury over plans for a 4,000-seater stadium

Mr Mitchell, 60 said he came up with idea for the stadium after years of under-investment of public facilities on the Sandbanks peninsula, in Poole Harbour.  

The area is reputed to be the fourth most expensive place in the world to buy real estate, behind New York, Moscow and London and some waterfront mansions have sold for up to £10million.

Its high-profile residents include Queen's Park Rangers manager Harry Redknapp, former Crystal Palace manager Tony Pulis, computer magnate Sir Peter Ogden and Body Shop investor Ian McGlinn.

Earlier this year Mr Mitchell revealed plans to turn the same area of council-owned land into an ultra-modern holiday destination like a 'mini-Dubai'.

Those plans included a 33-storey sports tower for abseiling and bungee jumping, a hotel shaped like a seagull, a marina and a helicopter landing pad.

But now he has back-peddled and said that his stadium plans were a more realistic goal.

Mr Mitchell, who has built more than 100 homes on Sandbanks and the surrounding districts, said the stadium would be for general use year-round and an ice rink could be housed there in winter.

'The stadium is modest in size and would fit exactly where the current pavilion sits at the moment,' he said.

'It was built in 1922 and is in a poor state of repair. It has no architectural value in my opinion and it's about time something was done with it.

'Beach football is a growing sport and we have one of the best locations in the country, and even the world. Beach volleyball is very popular too.

'If we had a permanent base which facilitates these sports, events would probably be held more often,' he said. 'It's a fantastic opportunity for the area.'

'Ten acres of that site is currently tarmac, this is a well-thought out scheme and the revenue we would bring in would help towards the infrastructure needed in the area.

'With the previous plans, I never said I was in a position to do that, I just wanted to gauge reactions to something happening here.

'If we don't keep up with the times Sandbanks will fall behind.

'This plan is realistic and can be built. I can build it and I would love to build it. It would be a wonderful project.'

Mr Mitchell said the stadium would take up under an acre of the ten-acre site and if the planning process goes smoothly he would hope to start building next autumn and open in spring 2016.

However, Sandbanks residents have expressed their fury over the plans and say the idea of a huge car park will be a blight on the landscape.

The plans for the stadium also include shops, restaurants, offices and beach studios on the exclusive resort

Terry Stewart, chairman of Southern Poole, a board of ten residents associations, said 'We don't support multi-storey blocks that would be a real visual carbuncle.

'Beach sports are fine but they don't require a large amount of building and actually Mr Mitchell's plans would be illegal under the Poole Corporation Act, an act of parliament that limits development on Sandbanks.'

Local resident Peter Stebbing said: 'I think it's a very bad idea. The beaches should be for children to play on.

'People have difficulty finding somewhere to park in the summer and the car park is jammed by 8am.

Sandbanks residents say the plans are a 'bad idea' as the area is already overcrowded with tourists 

Terry Stewart, chairman of a local residents associations, says a car park with be a blight on the landscape

'We don't need more tourism, the place is overcrowded as it is.

'I would be very much against it.

Poole council's planning department confirmed an outline planning application had been submitted.

Richard Gengem, planning and regeneration manager at the council, said: 'We can confirm that an outline planning application for a Sandbanks Beach Arena has been received.

'This proposal will now be checked for validation and subsequently considered by officers.

'We are aware that the proposals relate to land owned by Borough of Poole and appropriate notices have been served by the applicants.'
