Kitty, whose real name supposedly is Kitty White, is a girl who is five apples tall, weighs three apples and has blood type A. She lives in the London suburbs with her parents and her twin sister Mimmy. 

Anji, which is also known as the Bamboo Town of China, has noticed a significant growth in tourism in the past few years and the Hello Kitty theme park is expected to attract one million visitors each year.

Known for its luscious scenery with rich forests and natural scenery, Anji is the perfect location for Hello Kitty’s new-look ‘nature’ theme park.

According to The Hettema Group website, the new Hello Kitty Park will be ‘a very special home-away-from home for Hello Kitty and all her friends.’

‘Hello Kitty Park is both a festive playland and a natural park, where children learn about the environment through imaginative, hands-on activity,’

Each of nature’s five elements will be represented in five unique garden zones.

Wood, Fire, Water, Metal and Earth will have their own designated area within the park and each will help bring the famous Hello Kitty theme park to life.

A world festival area will feature holiday and cultural celebrations such as Chinese New Year.

There will be various interactive and walk-through activities, which will follow the popular Hello Kitty theme.

Sanrio already owns two theme parks in Japan - Puroland and Harmonyland - which attract millions of visitors every year

Hello Kitty shot to fame when she was created by Sanrio group in the 70s.

Since then, the white cat, with the bright, white, face and big, red, bow has adorned everything from stationary and backpacks to toasters and cars.

Sanrio already owns two theme parks in Japan - Puroland and Harmonyland - which attract millions of visitors every year.

Puroland, which is an indoor theme park based on Japanese cartoon characters, attracts more than 1.5 million visitors every year.

Harmoneyland is located in Hiji, Ōita, Kyūshū and is also based on the famous Sanrio characters, including Hello Kitty, Cinnamon and My Melody. 

With both parks exceeding expectations, the new theme park in China is likely to attract over a million visitors each year.

Puroland opened in 1990 and there have been a lot of technological advancement in the 24-years since it was built.

Speaking to inpark magazine, Phil Hettema of The Hettema Group said that people should expect a modern theme park.

'Sanrio has hundreds of characters, each with a unique personality. They have been an integral part of culture in Japan for decades. It’s our job to capture them authentically and incorporate them into the fabric of this park,'

‘The existing Sanrio parks were done quite a long time ago, and there are new ways to use media now to bring these characters to life and give people the chance to interact with them,’

'The location is one of the greenest parts of China and is really lovely,' he said. 

According to state media, there are nearly 60 theme parks being built across China right at the moment.
