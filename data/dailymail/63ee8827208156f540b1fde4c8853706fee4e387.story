Broadside: Bill Maher, pictured on the show Friday night, said audiences like American Sniper because it has no nuance and a 'psychopath' hero

It has become the runaway success of this round of Hollywood releases - but Bill Maher thinks American Sniper is only cleaning up at the box office because audiences lap up its 'psychopath' hero.

The talk show host characterized the film as a blast of patriotism which made movie-goers feel good about the war in Iraq - then laid into the character of protagonist Chris Kyle.

Maher, speaking on his HBO show Real Time with Bill Maher, drew on excerpts from the autobiography Kyle wrote before he was killed in February 2013, in which he said he enjoyed war and referred to his targets as 'savages'.

He chose parts of the book, also called American Sniper, where Kyle said 'I love killing bad guys - even with the pain I loved what I was doing.'

Maher also quoted the line 'maybe war isn't really fun but I certainly was enjoying it', as well as a point at which he said 'I hate the damn savages', in reference to the at least 160 people he shot dead in his time as a Navy SEAL.

The film, directed by Clint Eastwood, was then compared with Hurt Locker, another film centered on the Iraq war which made far less money, though won widespread praise.

Maher said: 'Hurt Locker' made $17million because it was a little ambiguous and thoughtful... [American Sniper] is just "American hero! He's a psychopath patriot, and we love him."'

The movie has prompted rows across the board, with figures as diverse as Seth Rogen and Sarah Palin piling in either to defend or lambast the feature and its protagonist.

Rogen compared American to a Nazi propaganda film in Quentin Tarantino's Inglorious Basterds - but later backtracked and said he didn't mean to make a political statement, only to point out that both segments featured snipers.

Meanwhile Palin took Hollywood figures, including Rogen and Farenheit 9/11 director Michael Moore, to task for what she saw as their disrespect for an American hero.

She wrote: 'Hollywood leftists: while caressing shiny plastic trophies you exchange among one another while spitting on the graves of freedom fighters who allow you to do what you do, just realize the rest of America knows you're not fit to shine Chris Kyle's combat boots.'

The controversies do not appear to have harmed the fortunes of the film, which brought in $107million on its first weekend and has earned six Academy Awards nominations.
