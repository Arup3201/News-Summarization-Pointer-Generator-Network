Angel Sanches, 17, has been arrested on suspicion of strangling cousin Katherina Gonzalez, five, to death and hanging her body in a closet

A 17-year-old illegal immigrant who is accused of  strangling his five-year-old cousin to death before leaving her body hanging in a closet has admitted raping her.

Angel Sanches-Zenteno was arrested earlier this month after Katherina Gonzalez's body was found inside a vacant apartment in Lake Highlands, Dallas.

Sanches-Zenteno told police he was with the girl, but said another man who he identified only as 'Carlos' was responsible for her death. 

According to police Sanches-Zenteno told them his cousin followed him into the building after he was taken hostage 'Carlos'.

Sanches-Zenteno claimed 'Carlos' forced him into the building at gunpoint before shutting him in the closet.

He had initially told police that he 'did not rape' Katherina, according to police documents, reports Dallas News.

He told another investigator that he did sexually assault the girl for 'less than a minute,' but did so because the other man was holding him at gunpoint and told him to.

Police took DNA samples from Sanches-Zenteno and sent them away to a lab for analysis. 

The lab matched his DNA to some found in the girl’s underwear, reports the news website.

Gonzalez' body was found in an abandoned property in this block of apartments (pictured). Sanches claims he was taken hostage by a man named 'Carlos' before his cousin followed him in and he escaped

But witness Freddie Washington says he saw Sanches-Zenteno lure Gonzalez into the abandoned housing block, telling the girl 'Come on, come on,' before the pair disappeared inside.

Mr Washington told WFAA 8: 'I think he waited for me to leave around the corner and then took her into the vacant apartment.' 

Tributes are left to the little girl who was found dead September 2 following a search for her after she was reported missing by her family

According to reports, Gonzalez was staying with her uncle at the time of the attack because both of her parents were at work.

Officers were called to reports that Gonzalez had gone missing, and after a thorough search found her body hanging in the closet.

He has now been charged with aggravated sexual assault in addition to capital murder.

Police said in an arrest warrant affidavit: 'At this time, the alleged second suspect has not yet been located.'

Police said he is an undocumented immigrant who has lived in the U.S. for six months to a year.
