Arsenal manager Arsene Wenger has revealed he puts himself into quarantine after his side lose and feels 'like a dog who is sick.'

The Gunners are currently third in the Premier League as they chase another season in the Champions League and Wenger's side won all six matches in March.

The 65-year-old, who has been Arsenal manager since 1996, insists if his side suffer defeat he goes into isolation to prevent his bad mood affecting other people in his life.

'I never go out after we lose, I just sit at home miserably and think about why we lost,' Wenger told Arsenal magazine.

'I've had periods where I've stayed at home for two or three days. If we have not got a game for a while, and we have lost, there are times when I have not gone out for days.

'It really hurts. If it does not, you will never survive in the game,' added Wenger.

'People who live around you suffer with you, so the only thing I can do is try to get out of other people's way.

'I try to be like a dog who is sick – I go away into quarantine and come back when I'm cured!'

Wenger will hope his side can continue their fine recent form against Liverpool after the international break, in a crucial fixture in the race for Champions League qualification.
