Miss Cain said she is furious after he ex-boyfriend Peter Atkinson was released from prison four months into a 40 week sentence for harassing her

A woman stalked by her ex-boyfriend during a five month campaign of harassment today said she is 'furious' he has been released from prison after just four months.

Rebecca Cain, 24, said she doesn't believe the 40 week sentence given to her former partner Peter Atkinson was long enough what he subjected her to.

Atkinson bombarded Miss Cain,with up to 200 messages a day after she split up with him and also posted naked pictures of her online in revenge.

He also managed to cancel Miss Cain's place at university without her knowledge, leaving her without a spot on her course. 

The 21-year-old has just been released from prison after being jailed for 40 weeks for harassment in July.

Miss Cain, a healthcare assistant, said at one stage she was so terrified she could not look out of the window as Atkinson continued to stalk her.

She said: 'Peter's sentence wasn't long enough - I couldn't be more disappointed.

'The time he spent in jail is less than the time he spent harassing me. I'm furious.'

The judge at the time described the case as 'among the worst I have ever seen.' 

Miss Cain and Atkinson met on dating website Plenty of Fish in February 2013 and started dating in July.

Atkinson, 21, moved 200 miles from his home in Cannock, Staffordshire to live with Miss Cain at her family home in Devon.

But the relationship started to go sour after he got possessive and started checking her phone everyday. 

The healthcare assistant said: 'The seven-month relationship ended in January when I discovered he had been lying to me about having a driving licence, even though he had been borrowing my car.'

However Atkinson did not accept the break-up and bombarded Miss Cain with up to 200 texts and phone calls a day, begging her to take him back.

He also organised for a female friend to impersonate Miss Cain and telephone admissions at Plymouth University - to cancel her application to study paramedic science.

By the time Miss Cain realised, it was too late and places had been filled.

Atkinson initially moved out of Miss Cain's home in Devon and returned to the Midlands.

But he then continued to harass her, sending her pictures of her car to prove he was watching her and had returned. He followed her to the homes of her patients and also turned up at her brother's home. 

On one occasion Atkinson got into the passenger side of her car and stole her mobile phone and shoes. 

Atkinson and Miss Cain met on dating website Plenty of Fish but split up after Atkinson became possessive 

Atkinson bombarded his former girlfriend with up to 200 messages a day begging that she take him back 

He rang her to demand she met him to get the items back and Miss Cain arranged to meet Atkinson at her home, and arranged for police to be there.

However this also failed as when she secretly dialled 999 Atkinson fled upstairs and jumped from the window - breaking both his legs and one arm. Police arrested Atkinson and took him to Torbay Hospital so his injuries could be treated.

This still did not stop Atkinson who threatened to kill Miss Cain's parents if she did not visit him in prison. 

He also used spyware he had installed on her phone when he stole it to arrive at her brother's home when she was there.  

Miss Cain said: He took over my life. I became reclusive because I was too scared to leave the house alone and I didn't see my friends for weeks.

Miss Cain said she has been forced to change her name, job and move house because of the harassment she endured at the hands of Atkinson

'I couldn't even look out of the window and I refused to answer my phone.

'Throughout my ordeal, I changed my number 10 times and yet he tracked me down every time.

'One day, I left a patient's house to find my work shoes - the same pair Peter had taken - waiting for me on top of my car. I felt physically sick from fear, and took the next day off work.'

Miss Cain changed jobs to work in a hospital so she would not have to work in patients' homes alone.  

After she spotted Atkinson driving in her home town Miss Cain contacted police who banned him from entering Devon but released him again. 

The 21-year-old then acted out more revenge on his former partner, creating an account  while she was on holiday with a friend, and posting naked pictures to it. 

Miss Cain said: 'Peter had made a Facebook account called 'Becky's nude pics' which was full of my private pictures - and he'd even added my friends and work colleagues to the account.

'I was so distraught and humiliated.

 'I trusted Peter and never imagined he'd betray me in that way.'

He also attempted to mow her friend down after believing he was her new boyfriend.  

In July Atkinson pleaded guilty to harassment, dangerous driving and handling a stolen car at Exeter Crown Court.

At the hearing Judge Gilbert QC said: 'It seems to me the offences of harassment are among the worst I have ever seen. It went on for ages. He bombarded the poor girl with texts and went to her address.'

Miss Cain has changed her name by deed poll and moved house in a bid to avoid any more harassment at the hands of Atkinson.  

Rachel Griffin, director of the Suzy Lamplugh Trust, the charity that runs the National Stalking Helpline said: 'The perpetrators of this crime are often people that have an obsessive fixation on their victim. 

'Sentences need to be long enough to allow enough time for treatment of the obsessive fixation that drives stalking behaviour; in many cases it is unrealistic to expect this behaviour simply to stop without specialist intervention.'
