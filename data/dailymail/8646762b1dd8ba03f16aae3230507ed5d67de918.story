He's not a politician, a movie star or even a football player but proud Average Joe Greg Packer has more column inches then all the Kardashians put together  - or at least takes the honor of being America's most-quoted man.

The retired highway maintenance worker, 59, has made it his life's mission to appear in the press.

From standing outside book launches; queuing to be the first to get his hands on much vaunted Apple products to attending celebrity funerals - Mr Packer has made it his plan to be most stopped by reporters.

Sleeping on the job! Dozens of reporters have happily taken quotes from Mr Packer over the years - not realizing that was his intention the whole time

Interview me: Mr Packer says there's nothing wrong with his publicity hungry ways

And it has worked.

Mr Packer's success has been so great that he has now been barred from being interviewed by the Associated Press and the New York Times.

Reporters across the country have been given the express instruction not to mention Mr Packer in print - unless, of course, it is to report on Mr Packer's own obsessive quest.

The Associated Press memo reads: 'To: News Editors/Correspondents USA. The world is full of all kinds of interesting people.

'One of them is Greg Packer from Huntington, NY who apparently lives to get his name on the Associated Press Wire and in other media...Mr. Packer is clearly eager to be quoted. Let's be eager too--to find other people to quote.'

Mr Packer's name appears more than a hundred times in the press on subjects as varied as roman catholicism, the war in Iraq, Whitney Houston's death, Hillary Clinton and the Steelers.

According to a profile in the Wall Street Journal, Mr Packer doesn't decide what he will say on an event ahead of time but will rather decide 'on the spur of the moment'.

He does, however, chose his positions wisely and collects all his clippings.

He first appeared in print in 1995 in The Tampa Tribune.

He was commenting on Pope John Paul II when he said: 'He does not limit his message to one faith; he reaches out to everybody.'

In 2007 he was first in line to buy an iPhone at Apple's Fifth Avenue store and in 2010 first in line for an iPad.

Sorrow and joy: Mr Packer appears at an arrange of events regardless of their mood from the funeral of Cardinal John O''Connor, left, in 2000 to Time's Square on New Year's Eve in 2001

He tells the story of how a New York Times reporter slammed his notebook on him in embarrassment at a Columbus Day Parade - recognizing this was the man he had been instructed to avoid at all costs.

'My name sounds familiar because I've been quoted so many times over the last 15 to 20 years,' he says in a new video interview with the New Yorker.

'The first time I saw my name in print I couldn't believe I had made a major newspaper. That made me feel that I had accomplished something. It's always been a case of the right place at the right time and knowing where reporters were going to do their job for the day.'

It's not only reporters he meets on his travels. As Mr News, Packer has met four Presidents, two popes and been to numerous major sports events.

He's been quoted as a New York Giants, Yankees, Phillies and a Steelers fan.

In an interview with Metro on Wednesday, he said his main ambition was to appear on Letterman or on the BBC in London.

'I do consider the Associated Press memo an accomplishment in my career,' he says in the New Yorker video.

'I think it's terrible reporters are getting in trouble for quoting me. If I'm their source for an interview I don't see any problem at all.

'I don't think that what I do is odd and I find it hard that some people do.'
