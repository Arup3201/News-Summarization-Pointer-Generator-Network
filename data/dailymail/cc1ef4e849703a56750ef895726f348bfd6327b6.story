Hundreds of 'human fireflies' swarmed the banks of Manchester Ship Canal last night in the first night of an extraordinary living art performance.

Runners dressed in specially commissioned, individually controlled LED light suits created beautiful patterns of light flowing over bridges, around public spaces and buildings of Salford Quays.

Around 400 runners took part in the opening performance of Speed of Light which is set to illuminate the historic waterfront home of BBC North, The Lowry and the Imperial War Museum North for the next two nights.

Creative: The backdrop to this section of the performance is the BBC's new Media City complex

The specially designed suits are centrally controlled and can instantaneously change colour, flash-rate and luminosity, producing stunning light patterns.

Each is powered by a dynamo attached to the wearers' wrists which harvests the energy of their movements and converts it to electricity.

Originally conceived of as a response to the London 2012 Olympics, Speed of Light has previously been staged at the Edinburgh International Festival and, more recently, the docklands of Yokohama, Japan.

A spokesman for NVA, the Scottish arts charity behind the work, said: 'A centrepiece of the Edinburgh International Festival and recently staged in the docklands of Yokohama in Japan , the night-time work uses light, intentional movement and sound to change the way we see and feel about a chosen environment.'

See for yourself: Speed of light is free to watch and will be continuing around Salford Quays between 8pm and 9pm tonight and tomorrow night

Big hopes: The show was commissioned for the area by Quays Culture, a new arts programme based in the area which aims to attract new talent to Greater Manchester

The spokesman added: 'Movement is seen as fundamental to how we order our perception of space, thus the rhythm of movement becomes a source of creativity in itself extending our understanding of the world.

'For a watching audience Speed of Light can be seen as a piece of abstract art, operating at the grandest scale, where the physical surroundings become an open canvas carrying a new visual language, expressing mood and movement, comprised of form, colour and line.

'It is also a monumental public artwork equally at home on a hillside or in the urban heart of a city, but one that is still surprisingly quiet and reflective in its mood.'

NVA is an acronym of 'nacionale vitae activa', a latin phrase describing ‘the right to influence public affairs’.
