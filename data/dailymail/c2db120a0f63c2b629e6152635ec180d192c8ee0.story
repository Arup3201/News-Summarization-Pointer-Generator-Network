This is the 12-year-old boy who was swept out to sea in North Wales amid 'horrendous' conditions.

Isaac Nash, from Huddersfield, West Yorkshire, was paddling in shallow water with 
another young boy at Aberffraw, Anglesey, on Friday when a large wave 
landed them both in difficulty.

The
 father of the other boy was able to swim out and rescue his son, while 
Isaac's grandfather also managed to wade out and grab his grandson.

But after being struck by a huge wave, he lost his grip on Isaac, who was then dragged out to sea.

Yesterday, police divers, coastguards and a helicopter continued to search for the schoolboy, who had been on a camping holiday with his parents and grandparents.

Lifeboats and an RAF Sea King Rescue helicopter 
resumed the search yesterday morning after it was called off because of 
fading light the previous night.

Coastguards said the search was being carried out in 'horrendous' conditions with poor visibility and very rough seas.

His desperate relatives were said to be pacing the shoreline with other searchers on Friday night.

Anglesey coastguard manager Dave Brewer said: 'We understand the father of one of the boys managed to grab him, while the grandfather tried to grab the other child before a wave swept over them and he lost his grip.'

The alarm was raised at around 12.30pm on Friday. Coastguards rescue teams, RNLI lifeboats, a RAF rescue helicopter, a police helicopter and an air ambulance have been searching the water all afternoon.

Police divers have also been searching underwater near to where he was swept away.

Difficult conditions: The weather has deteriorated off the coast of Aberffaw, Anglesey, where Isaac went missing. It is said to be rough with very choppy seas - swells were reported as being 10ft-high yesterday

A spokesperson for the Maritime and Coastguard Agency said on Friday: 'Coastguards are this afternoon searching for a 12-year-old boy who is believed to have been swept out to sea at Aberffraw.

'Holyhead Coastguard received a 999 call at around 12.30 this lunchtime reporting that three people were stuck on rocks in the estuary.

'Further information then suggested that two men had managed to make it back to shore, plus a young boy. However another youngster was caught in the large waves and swept out to sea.'
