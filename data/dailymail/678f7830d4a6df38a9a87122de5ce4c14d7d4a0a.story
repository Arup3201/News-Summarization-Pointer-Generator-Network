Starting next month, students at Coastal Carolina University won't have to drive to the nearest Starbucks. Starbucks is coming to them.

Starbucks has selected Coastal Carolina as one of three campuses across the nation where mobile trucks will roll this fall as part of a pilot program.

Expect to see the white trucks emblazoned with the Starbucks branding on the campuses of Virginia's James Madison University and Arizona State in Phoenix this fall, as well.

Mobile Starbucks: Starbucks will roll out food trucks that offer almost identical menu items to their stores for a pilot program beginning this fall

The company says the trucks will offer the same menu of food and drinks that customers can get in a regular Starbucks store.

The trucks will move to different campus locations during the day.

The other mobile trucks will be at Arizona State and James Madison University in Virginia. The Coastal Carolina service starts Sept. 18.

'People are surprised to see it, and then they're excited,' Ike Van Skike, district manager for Starbucks licensed stores, said in a release. 'ASU faculty and staff tell me this is great for them because it's an area of the campus that doesn't have a lot of food service.'

A spokeswoman for Aramark, the company that will operated the trucks in partnership with Starbucks, is confident there is a place in the marketplace for the trucks.

'Between classes, homework, extracurricular activities, jobs, and socializing with friends, today's students truly embody the on-the-go lifestyle,' said Aramark Education VP Cathy Schlosberg. 'We believe the Starbucks mobile truck is a perfect opportunity to increase the convenience of our offerings and help meet our student body wherever they are in their busy days.'
