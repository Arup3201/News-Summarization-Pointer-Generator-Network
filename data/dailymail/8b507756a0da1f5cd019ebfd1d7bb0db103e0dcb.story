Dozens of rare birds smuggled into Europe from Indonesia had to be killed after one was discovered to have the deadly H5N1 bird flu virus.

The 60 birds - wild parrots, birds of paradise and other exotic species - had been trafficked from Bali to Qatar and then through Austria's Vienna International Airport.

They were smuggled in a suitcase before being killed by vets after the smugglers were caught. More than 30 of the birds were already dead when customs officials opened the case.

Tests on the bodies revealed that at least one of the birds had been infected with the deadly H5N1 virus.

A customs spokesman said: 'As a result of the discovery, all the surviving birds have been destroyed by the border veterinary service.

'Anyone who came into contact with them has also been informed and is receiving treatment.'

Earlier this week the World Health Organisation urged health workers around the world to be on the alert for symptoms of the virus, which has the potential to circle the globe and cause a pandemic.

The United Nations agency, which issued 
new, long-awaited guidance to countries on influenza pandemics, gave the
warnings for two human strains of bird flu - H5N1, which emerged a 
decade ago, and H7N9, which was first detected in China in March.
