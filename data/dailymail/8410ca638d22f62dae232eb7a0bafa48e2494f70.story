This is the face of the man suspected of gunning down members of a British Iraqi family in the Alps.

French police investigating the 
horrific crime have finally released a portrait of the possible killer –
a year and two months after the attack.

The unnamed motorcyclist with a 
goatee was seen by several witnesses near the scene, allowing an image 
to be generated on a computer.

Annecy prosecutor Eric Maillaud 
finally agreed to release the portrait of the man, who was wearing a 
crash helmet and sunglasses.

In September 2012, satellite engineer 
Saad al-Hilli was mysteriously murdered along with his wife Ikbal, 47, 
his mother-in-law Suhaila al-Allaf, 74, and Sylvain Mollier, a 
45-year-old French cyclist close to the village of Chevaline.

Mr al-Hilli's two daughters, Zeena, four, and Zainab, seven, were with the family in the car.

Zainab was left fighting for her life
after being shot in the shoulder and bludgeoned over the head with a 
gun, while Zeena hid underneath her mother's skirt in the back of the 
car and survived unscathed.

In the days after the murder, at least
three forestry workers were among those who helped police put together 
an identikit image of the suspect.

Mr Maillaud is now facing questions as
to why he did not release the image to the public in the days after the
murder, when it had grabbed the attention of the world's media. The 
prosecutor in turn defended his decision, saying it was kept out of the 
public domain for 'strategic reasons'.

'We did not want this person to go into hiding,' Mr Maillaud added.

Former RAF pilot Brett Martin 
discovered the gruesome murders while on a bike ride, and described how 
he had seen a motorcyclist riding away from the scene shorty beforehand.

One of the forestry workers said he saw the motorcyclist pull into the parking spot where the Hilli family were murdered.

He described the motorcycle as white and black with panniers and said it was ridden by a man dressed in black.

One explained that his colleagues 
later talked to the man about a minor traffic violation – effectively 
driving in a part of the mountain where cars were banned – and described
him as having 'a bit of a beard'.

According to Mr Maillaud, the forestry
worker's colleagues were able to 'get a glimpse' of his face when he 
lifted his helmet's face shield.

The two forestry workers have also 
described seeing a grey BMW 4x4 close to the murder scene, saying it was
a right-hand drive British car. It was said to be driven by a man 
described as 'slightly bald' with 'dark skin, no glasses' – suggesting 
he might be an accomplice to the crime.

The helmet opens from the side to allow a wearer to have a conversation without removing the whole helmet.

But despite checks with manufacturers over the past year, no-one has been able to track down the helmet's owner.

Police investigator Benoit Vinnemann confirmed that the wearer of the helmet is 'potentially the perpetrator'.

Zaid al-Hilli, Saad's 54-year-old 
brother who lives in Chessington, Surrey, was arrested by British police
in June on suspicion of masterminding the killings. He denies all the 
claims, and has been bailed to return to his local police station in 
January.

Zaid claims that French police have 
failed to properly investigate the possibility that the real target was 
Sylvain Mollier, a Frenchman who was also shot dead near the family's 
car as he cycled through the hills above Lake Annecy.

'They are covering up for someone in 
France' said Zaid al-Hilli. 'Mollier was involved in family disputes and
was an outsider to his rich family. We are dealing with very powerful 
local people, they know each other and are in each other's pockets.

They focused attention on us, it has a
racist background.' Mr Al-Hilli, a payroll manager, said he was in 
Worthing, Sussex, on the day of the murder, and his alibi has been 
confirmed. He has spent a total of 25 hours talking to the British 
police, but has refused all requests to travel to France.

The French claim that one of the 
reasons Mr Al-Hilli was arrested was because of a series of mysterious 
phone calls to Romania when he could have been 'hiring' a hitman.

But Mr Al-Hilli said this was 
absolute fiction, saying: 'I have no idea where Romania came from; I've 
never even been asked about Romania.'

Mr Al-Hilli said he would be prepared 
to take a lie detector, and was on 'a mission to find out the truth.' He
thinks the possibility of Mr Mollier being the target has been played 
down because of the influence of the 'rich, powerful local family' of 
Mollier's girlfriend, the pharmacy heiress Claire Schutz.

Mr Mollier had just started three 
years paternity leave from the nuclear components factory where he 
worked, and was relying on the now extremely rich Ms Schutz to support 
him.

It was Ms Schutz's father, Thierry 
Schutz, who suggested the cycling route towards the village of Chevaline
along which Mr Mollier died.

In the year since Mr Mollier's death, 
his surviving family have refused to release a photograph him, have 
never paid public tribute to him, and have attempted to keep all details
of his life a secret.

The Al-Hillis' daughters, Zeena,and 
Zainab, are now being looked after by other family members in the UK, 
following a legal battle to remove them from the care of Social 
Services.

Sorry we are unable to accept comments for legal reasons.
