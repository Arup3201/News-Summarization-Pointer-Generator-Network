Last month Jessica Livings, 19, revealed she had caught TB while cleaning an open wound on her pet cat, Onyx

A teenager told last night of her horrific ordeal of catching TB from her pet kitten.

In what is believed to be the first case of its kind in the world, Jessica Livings was struck down with pneumonia and had to have emergency surgery.

The 19-year-old was later rushed back to hospital in agony for further treatment for severe lung damage.

Another victim suffered the same symptoms of bovine tuberculosis and Jessica’s mother Claire contracted the dormant form of the disease.

It also emerged that a child from the south west caught TB from a pet dog.

The youngster, who was under 10, eventually recovered, but the dog was put down.

It is thought that the pair who caught the disease from a cat did so when cleaning a wound on the pet, which they had taken in only five weeks before.

Jessica said: ‘I lost a stone and half in five weeks, I was very ill and had fevers, cold sweats and hallucinations. I didn’t realise what was real and what wasn’t.’

The kitten, which is thought to have picked up the disease from badgers, has died from the illness.

Thirty-nine people who may have been in contact with infected cats have been offered screening for TB.

Jessica was diagnosed with the disease in October after a vet raised concerns about an outbreak among cats in the Newbury area of Berkshire.

Seven of the nine infected creatures had bite wounds thought to have come during fights with badgers.

Six have been put down or have died and an 18-month-old tabby named Milhouse has vanished.

Jessica is now categorised as being at no risk of passing on TB despite her emergency readmission to the Royal Berkshire Hospital last month.

She is on a nine-month course of antibiotics. She said: ‘I feel much better now, last year was very tough especially because I didn’t know what it was.’

Onyx: Both Miss Livings and her mother Claire caught the disease from this kitten, though Claire only contracted a dormant form - meaning she is infected but has no symptoms

Her mother said: ‘For the first three weeks Onyx was fine then he became poorly and we discovered he had an open wound under his belly. We took him to the vet two times and the third we kept him in.

‘He died two days later. We had no idea it was TB.

‘But we were very careful and conscious to be clean around him but somewhere along the line we weren’t as careful as we should have been.

‘When Onyx died we were told they’d run some tests as he died so suddenly and then we found out he had TB.

Carl Gorman, who is the vet who reported the outbreak as well as being the owner of missing Milhouse, believes it started with a local herd of cows contracting TB.

He is treating the two surviving cats despite Nigel Gibbens, the chief veterinary officer, stating: ‘For public health reasons the most sensible course of action when a cat is diagnosed with culture-confirmed M bovis infection is euthanasia rather than treatment.’

Dr Gorman said: ‘The CVO’s advice is correct but we can’t force the pet-owners to put their animals to sleep at the moment. That’s the law.

‘We can give them advice and inform them of the risks. Every case has to be looked at individually. The two cats we are treating at the moment do not have any external sores so they are both low risk.’

Public Health England confirmed two patients infected by the TB bacteria mycobacterium bovis were undergoing treatment.

Officials said two others have been diagnosed with latent TB. This means they have been exposed to the disease but are not showing symptoms.

Dilys Morgan, of Public Health England, said: ‘These are the first documented cases of cat-to-human transmission.’

The British farming industry is forced to slaughter 30,000 cows with TB each year.

In total nine cats are known to have been infected. Jasper (left) died after contracting the disease, while Mocha (right) was put down in keeping with guidance from the UK's chief vet

It is argued that the spread of the disease is accelerated by badgers and the Government is undertaking a cull to try to combat the problem.

It is rare for cats to contract TB, with about 25 cases each year in Britain. The nine infected cats all lived within three miles of each other –  and six within a 250-yard radius.

Another pet owner has told of her anguish after her cat contracted tuberculosis and had to be put down.

Julie Foster, 38, said that when Mocha developed a painful lump on his paw she and husband Russell, 34, had no idea it could be the disease.

‘We’d never heard of cats with TB,’ the mother of one said. ‘The whole thing has been a complete mystery.’

Another cat called Jasper is known to have died after being infected.
