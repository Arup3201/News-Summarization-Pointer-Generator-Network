Miley Cyrus and Britney Spears have never been afraid to court controversy with their music videos, but now their raunchy antics have got them banned from French TV before the watershed.

France's broadcasting watchdog has said that Miley's Wrecking Ball and Britney's Work B**** must be shown after 10pm when more 'adult' programming is on.

In a statement the CSA said the Wrecking Ball video - in which Miley writhes naked - was too sexualised for daytime viewing.

Britney's Work B**** has also been restricted on the grounds that it shows 'a sadomachistic universe representing women in a way that risks shocking many viewers'

It added that Work B**** - which shows Britney in bondage gear and whipping female dancers - presents 'a sadomachistic universe representing women in a way that risks shocking many viewers'.

The ban will do little to deter the singers however, as Miley's video became the most viewed on YouTube in 24 hours when it was released in September last year, generating 12.5million hits. It currently has more than 475million views.

Despite its popularity the clip drew concern from fellow songstress Sinead O'Connor after Miley said she was inspired by her 1990 Nothing Compares 2 U video.

Since it was launched in October last year Britney's video has received 70million views on YouTube

Britney's video was even reportedly banned in the UK before 10pm, with music channels asking for a 'clean edit' to go along with a much-censored Work version of the song

Veteran performer O'Connor penned an open letter to the younger singer, urging her 'don't let the music industry make a prostitute of you'.

She wrote: ‘I am extremely concerned for you that those around you have led you to believe, or encouraged you in your own belief, that it is in any way "cool" to be naked and licking sledgehammers in your videos.

'It is in fact the case that you will obscure your talent by allowing yourself to be pimped, whether it’s the music business or yourself doing the pimping.

Miley's video became the most viewed in 24 hours when it first appeared, getting 12.5million clicks in one day, while it now has over 475million

‘Nothing but harm will come in the long run, from allowing yourself to be exploited, and it is absolutely NOT in ANY way an empowerment of yourself or any other young women, for you to send across the message that you are to be valued (even by you) more for your sexual appeal than your obvious talent.’

Meanwhile Britney's raunchy offering, which was released in October, has drawn 70million viewers online.

Her video was also reportedly banned from UK music channels before 10pm at the time of release, with broadcasters asking for a clean edit to go along with the much-censored Work version of the song.
