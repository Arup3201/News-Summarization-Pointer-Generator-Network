Manchester City won the last Asia Trophy, beating Sunderland in  Hong Kong in July 2013

Details for the clash are yet to be confirmed and finalised, but Arsenal are likely to face a Thai Premier League XI in Bangkok.

Arsene Wenger's men will then fly back to London for the annual Emirates Cup tournament before the start of the new season.

As per usual, Arsenal are likely to travel to Austria for a behind-closed doors training camp in addition to the Asia trip.
