Ibrahima Conte was denied a last minute penalty as Guinea and Cameroon played out the fourth consecutive 1-1 draw in Group D of the Africa Cup of Nations in Malabo.

In a dramatic finish to the match the Guinea striker burst clear into the left side of the box where he fell under a challenge by Jerome Guihoata, but referee Tessema Bamlak took no action.

Moments earlier, Stephane M'Bia should have won it for Cameroon when he was served up a free header from Benjamin Moukandjo's free-kick but flashed it inches wide from eight yards.

It proved another frustrating night for Cameroon who had needed a late equaliser to salvage a draw against Mali in their opening match and were hoping for better second time round.

Moukandjo forced an early save out of nervy Guinea keeper Naby Yattara then the same player opened the scoring in the 13th minute when his corner from the left struck Yattara and deflected into the net.

Mohamed Yattara almost drew Guinea level within five minutes when he intercepted a sloppy clearance by Cameroon goalkeeper Fabrice Ondoa who recovered just enough to flap the ball out of play.

Borussia Monchengladbach striker Ibrahima Traore drew a good low save out of Ondoa before the Guineans drew level in the 42nd minute.

Traore picked up a neat pass from Issiaga Sylla and turned his marker M'Bia before lashing a low left-foot shot past Ondoa's out-stretched arm.

Cameroon had the better of the second half chances with only a superb challenge from Abdoulaye Cisse preventing an almost certain goal from Edgard Salli at point-blank range.

Vincent Aboubakar headed inches wide and a Salli effort was deflected out for a corner but Guinea still looked dangerous on the break and Naby Keita should have done better with a rising shot which flew over Ondoa's bar.

Yattara saved bravely at the feet of Salli with 10 minutes remaining before M'Bia ought to have won it after Cisse fouled Eric Choupo-Moting on the left.

And there was still time for Conte to claim a stoppage-time spot-kick which was waved away as both sides were forced to settle for another draw.
