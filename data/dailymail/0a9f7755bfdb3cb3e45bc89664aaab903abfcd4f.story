A new mother and her baby girl lay dead together alone for up to three weeks because no one tried to open their unlocked front door.

Joanne Thomas, 27, was found with four-month-old Harper after neighbours, friends and a social worker all walked away from her home when she failed to answer.

But an inquest heard that when police were finally called to the house they opened the unlocked front door straight away by simply trying the handle.

Miss Thomas and little Harper lived alone and mystery surrounds why they died.

The pair were meant to be seen by social services to check on their progress after Miss Thomas separated from her partner.

The inquest heard how mother and baby were said to be 'comfortable and happy' and were not a concern to health visitors.

However, a social worker failed to see or hear from Miss Thomas after calling on her three separate times because they didn’t try to answer the door.

Neighbours became so concerned they stood on a bin to looking through a bedroom window which is when they made the horrific discovery.

They immediately called police who opened the unlocked front door on arrival and walked straight into the house.

Social worker Jamie Robins told the inquest: 'It was up to me to visit the family on a regular basis and address any support they needed.

'They were happy and comfortable - there was nothing to be concerned about.'

Mr Robins said he visited Miss Thomas's home in Troedyrhiw near Merthyr Tydfil, South Wales, three times in the weeks before they were discovered dead.

But he left because he was unable to get an answer - not realising they were dead just yards away.

He said: 'I went back and explained to my line manager that the mother and child had not been seen for a number of weeks.'

Mr Robins said he also sent letters to her home and tried to contact Miss Thomas's family.

Her mother Iris Thomas said she visited her and her grandchild every weekend and last saw her four weeks before the discovery of their bodies.

She said: 'I rang her the following Friday and she told me there was no need to come - that was the last time I ever spoke to her.

'We would text all the time but it was not unusual for Joanne not to speak or have contact with me for a week or 10 days.'

Miss Thomas's sister Rachel Lewis said she last saw her while shopping with baby Harper in a push chair.

She said: 'She said she wan’t feeling very well but there was no cause for concern. She was just looking a bit drained.'

Aberdare coroners court was told Miss Thomas cancelled her appointment with a community health worker a month before she was discovered dead.

The inquest heard baby Harper also missed her appointment at an immunisation clinic in in the weeks before they were discovered dead in July 3.

As concerns were growing police were notified to carry out a welfare check on the mother and baby due at the beginning of July.

Mr Robins went to the terraced house on July 3 and spoke with neighbours who were extremely concerned that 'something was not right' because the mother and baby hadn’t been seen.

Neighbours took matters into their own hand and climbed on a bin to discover mother and baby dead in the first floor bedroom.

Officers opened the unlocked front door and were hit by an extremely strong smell and discovered the distressing scene of mother and daughter dead in bed together.

They were so badly decomposed that they had to be identified by dental records and DNA.

The inquest was told the cause of Miss Thomas and baby Harper’s deaths were a complete mystery.

Police found a quantity of blood in the bedroom, on the banister and in a saucepan on the bedroom floor.

But foul play was ruled out by police after a post-mortem examnination revealed Miss Thomas had been vomiting blood due to a stomach illness.

Carbon monoxide poisoning was ruled out after tests were carried out on all the gas and heating appliances in the house and none were found to be faulty.

Another mystery surrounding the deaths was revealed by baby Harper being found in a unsoiled nappy.

Pathologist Dr Stephen Leadbetter said because of the lapse in time in discovering mother and daughter it was 'impossible' to give a medical cause of death.

Detective Inspector Tudor Thomas, of South Wales Police, said: 'There was no one else involved, carbon monoxide was not involved, and it was not an overdose.

'I am unable to give a clear explanation of what caused Joannes death.'

Glamorgan Valleys coroner Andrew Barkley said there was no evidence Joanne had taken her own life and foul play had been ruled out by the police.

He described it as an unusual, upsetting and tragic case.

Mr Barkley said: 'There was also no evidence that Harper was given any drugs prior to her death.'The cause of the deaths of Joanne and Harper are unascertained. Having considered all the possibilities there remains real doubt.'

He recorded an open verdict on the deaths of mother and baby.

After the hearing tearful sister Rachel said: 'We still don’t know how either of them died.

'It’s a tragedy and we don’t know how any of us are going to get over it.'
