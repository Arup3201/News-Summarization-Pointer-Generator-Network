Vice President Joe Biden came to the defense of embattled Democratic National Committee chair Debbie Wasserman Schultz on Friday in a speech at the organization's annual Women's Leadership Forum. 

Biden told the predominately female audience that it's 'great to work' with the Florida congressman and that he'd 'never seen anybody work as hard and as tirelessly' as her.

'And by the way, if we want anybody to do that 60 seconds or 120 seconds we get to respond to some attack on the president or the administration, the best person...is always Debbie,' he said.

Biden's full-throated support for Wasserman Schultz came a day and half after a Politico report claimed she was on the outs with the White House - and the Democratic Party - and may soon be asked to step down from her position in party leadership.

The fiery federal lawmaker was never a lock to have a third term as chief spokesperson for the main branch of the national party, but her recent comparison of a GOP governor to a wife beater put her position in even greater jeopardy.

While speaking at a forum in support of Wisconsin gubernatorial candidate Mary Burke, a Democrat, Wasserman Schultz claimed that incumbent Republican Governor Scott Walker 'has given women the back of his hand.'

'I know that is stark. I know that is direct. I know that is reality,' she said.

The DNC chair went on to claim that 'Republican Tea Party extremists' like Walker 'are grabbing us by the hair and pulling us back.'

The female lawmaker's claim was roundly criticized as inappropriate and insensitive to survivors of domestic violence, and the following day Wasserman Schultz issued an apology.

While the outspoken Democratic leader has made colorful remarks in the past about Republicans' opposition to policies her party says benefit women, Wasserman Schultz latest claim ruffled more feathers than usual and restarted an underground campaign to have her ousted as DNC chair.  

Among the complaints lodged against the female party head in the article is that she's more concerned with her own political ambitions than promoting the party.

 'We say the big "D" is for Democratic,' a Democratic member of Congress is quoted as telling his colleagues in February during retreat. 'For her, the big "D" is always for Debbie.'

'People know she works hard,' another contemporary of Wasserman Schutlz's is blindly quoted as having said. 'But there’s this sense that she only works hard for herself.'  

The article also claimed that President Barack Obama and Wasserman Schultz have 'rarely' spoken to each other since 2011, either in person or over the phone. When the president has meetings with other party committee heads, he does not invite Wasserman Schultz, Politco's sources said.

Desperate for the president's attention, Wasserman Schultz join photo lines at events featuring Obama in order to have his ear, if only for a few moments, Politico contended.

In an official statement about Wasserman Schultz's tenure as DNC chair, Deputy White House spokesman Eric Schultz claimed that that Florida politician was doing 'a great job' helping Democratic candidates put their best foot forward in their upcoming elections.

'The president is grateful for all of the hard work being done by the entire team at the DNC. He fully recognizes the value of their work, and that’s why he has worked so hard to support them,' the White House flack said.

But behind the scenes, Democrats are arguing that Wasserman Schultz should be replaced as the committee's head at the conclusion of the current election cycle, Politico revealed.

If the incidents relayed in Politico's article did in fact happen, Democrats' opinion of the Florida representative have shifted significantly since she was named head of the influential party committee in 2011.

In announcing her promotion, Politico stated that she was 'beloved by the Democratic rank and file for her aggressive, outspoken advocacy for liberal points of view.'

The Democratic National Committee chairwoman did not address her critics during today's event, but in keeping with the theme of the conference, she made the case for putting women in charge of the Democratic Party's outreach efforts.

'The reason that you're here,' she told conference attendees, is 'because you know as well as I do that more often than not if you want to get something done, you send a woman to do it.' 

Wasserman Schultz notably cudgeled Republican candidates for not knowing how to talk to appropriately talk to women voters in her remarks, as well, and argued that female voters should elect Democrats to office if they want lawmakers who reflect 'their values as women.'

The Vice President, who made a few gaffes of his own in recent days, didn't weigh in on controversy plaguing Wasserman Schultz, however he went out of his way to talk her up as both a friend and a party leader.

Biden teasingly compared his former colleague to his 'little sister,' noting that when she needs him to do something, 'she doesn't even ask, she just tells me where to go, what to do,' before moving on the topic of his speech, which was, somewhat ironically, domestic violence and sexual assault.

Speaking about his early support for legislation that would make make violence against women illegal, Biden said he 'couldn't understand why a woman, who twice a week her husband was home smashing her head against a wall, chocking her, would live in that circumstance for years.'

Biden used the speaking gig to promote the White House's new public awareness campaign about sexual assault on college campuses, It's on Us.

'There will always be some man raising his hand to someone weaker physically, whether a woman or a child,' the Vice President admitted. 'But success will come when the societal attitude changes, and not a single woman in the world asks herself the question, what did I do?

'Never, never, never is it the woman's fault, other than self-defense. Never! Never!' Biden shouted amid uproarious clapping from the crowd.  

President Obama will also address the women's leadership conference later this afternoon, and he will likely talk about the importance of electing women to the Senate, in addition to the White House's efforts to decrease sexual assault on campus.

Touching on the upcoming elections this morning, Biden claimed the progress women have made will 'slide back a decade' if Democrats lose control of the Senate and don't gain seats in the House.

'The president is a wonderful guy. He's my great personal friend. But right now we feel like [Horatius] at the bridge or little Dutch men at the dyke,' Biden said referring to two ancient fables about outnumbered men overcoming unthinkable obstacles.

'I mean all we're able to do right now is stop bad things from happening. That's useful, but that's not why we wanted the job,' Biden continued.

'We wanted the job to do things, and we've done a lot through the president's executive orders and the first two years when we had a Democratic House. So folks it's time for us to step up and make our case without apology.'

As the Vice President took the stage to give his remarks, Wasserman Schultz lavished praise on him, saying, 'He is a treasure. A national treasure.'

Stating that she was neutral as the DNC chair 'and would be' in 2016, she told the audience she sported a Biden for President button on her backpack in 1988 during the Delaware politician's first run for president.  

'My God, I'm getting old,' Biden told attendees afterward, eliciting an outburst of laughter from the audience. 

'A national treasure. Gosh, almighty,' he said.
