Paris Saint-Germain have emerged as strong favourites to land Real Madrid winger Angel Di Maria.

The Argentine wide-man has an increasingly uncertain future at the Bernabeu after Real prioritised the Colombian playmaker James Rodriguez as their prime marquee target for this summer.

Although manager Carlo Ancelotti is reluctant to lose Di Maria, who was outstanding in Real's Champions League winning campaign last season, President Florentino Perez has identified Rodriguez as a new 'galactico' with enormous potential for the club both on and off the pitch.

Angel pursuit: PSG are now favourites to sign Di Maria with Manchester United yet to submit a bid

Top form: Di Maria had an excellent season for Real Madrid last year, including helping to win 'la decima'

PSG now believe that they are the leading contenders to sign the 26-year-old Di Maria, whose contract in Madrid has another four years to run.

Real are holding out for an offer that will approach £50million and the Madrid-based Press has been in overdrive over the last few weeks linking Di Maria to both PSG and United.

Sportsmail understands that United have not made formal contact with Real or the player's representatives this summer, although he is a player that they have been monitoring for several months.

At this point, United are yet to resolve whether they will firm up that interest with a significant bid but reports in Spain this weekend suggest that Di Maria's preference would be for a move to Paris, with the lure of Champions League football and the petrodollars on offer too good to turn down.

Parisian preference: The player has indicated that he would rather join PSG than United

New United manager Louis van Gaal will arrive in Manchester this week, where he will hold discussions with the club's hierarchy over several prospective signings.

He is keen to recruit at least one centre half, with a move for Arsenal's Thomas Vermaelen still in the pipeline, although United are yet to reach a compromise with the London club over a fee. 

United retain a keen interest in Arturo Vidal of Juventus as Van Gaal looks to add strength to the midfield.

Decision time: Van Gaal will arrive at United on Wednesday and wants Memphis Depay and Thomas Vermaelen

United would also like to add winger to their ranks and it remains to be seen whether Van Gaal will ask executive vice-chairman Ed Woodward to step up the pursuit of Di Maria.

Marco Reus of Borussia Dortmund was a target during the David Moyes reign but Memphis Depay of Holland may now be a more realistic alternative.
