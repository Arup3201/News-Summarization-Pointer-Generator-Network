The picture comes as 72-hour truce between Israel and Hamas is set to expire at midnight local time

The picture comes as 72-hour truce between Israel and Hamas is set to expire at midnight local time with negotiators in Cairo trying to thrash out a more permanent ceasefire arrangement.

Since the latest truce went into effect on Monday, Israel has halted military operations in the coastal territory and Gaza militants have stopped firing rockets.

The ceasefire was meant to give the two sides time to negotiate a more sustainable truce and a roadmap for the coastal territory. 

During the ceasefire, people have strewn graffiti across the walls of buildings in Gaza, expressing their views on the conflict

A member of the Palestinian delegation to Egyptian-brokered talks in Cairo said Wednesday that his team was considering an Egyptian proposal, which was tabled on Tuesday.

The Egyptian proposal calls for easing parts of the Israeli blockade of Gaza, bringing some relief to the territory, according to Palestinian officials in the talks.

Meanwhile six people were killed, including three members of a bomb disposal unit and an Italian journalist, while the Palestinian team attempted to defuse an unexploded Israeli rocket in Gaza.

The journalist was later named as 35-year-old video journalist Simone Camilli, who worked for the Associated Press, who died alongside his translator Ali Shehda Abu Afash.
