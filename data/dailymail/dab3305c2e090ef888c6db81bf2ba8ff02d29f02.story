The Premier League is now so wealthy that all 20 clubs from England’s top flight last season are among the richest 40 clubs in the world by income — even relegated Norwich City.

There are five English clubs in the top 10 of the football ‘Rich List’, published on Thursday by accountants Deloitte.

Manchester United are back up to No 2 behind Real Madrid.

Half of the top 40 wealthiest football clubs are from the Premier League, according to a new survey

Champions League winners Real Madrid are the wealthiest club in the world 

United’s income of £433million in 2013-14 left them behind the Spanish giants, who brought in £459m, but ahead of third-placed Bayern Munich (£407.7m), Barcelona in fourth (£405.3m) and Paris Saint-Germain in fifth (£396.6m). Real Madrid have now been the richest club by earnings for 10 years in a row.

Manchester City (£346.5m), Chelsea (£324.4m), Arsenal (£300m) and Liverpool (£255.8m) are next in the top 10. Newcastle and Everton squeeze into the top 20, with West Ham and Aston Villa just below them.

Southampton are the 25th richest club in the world (on £106.1m), with Sunderland, Swansea and Stoke inside the top 30.

The rest of last season’s Premier League teams earned more than the £80m necessary for a top-40 place. This was largely down to lucrative new 2013-16 TV deals which began to pour into club coffers last season.

Austin Houlihan, senior manager at Deloitte, said: ‘This is testament to the huge appeal of the Premier League globally and the equality of distribution the clubs enjoy relative to their European counterparts.’
