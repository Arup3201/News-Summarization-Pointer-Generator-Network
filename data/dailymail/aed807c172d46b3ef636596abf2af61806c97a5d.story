A British farmer who has spent a quarter of his life, £130,000 and been held at gunpoint last night vowed to continue to hunt for Second World War Spitfires he believes are buried in Burma.

David Cundall, 62, of Lincolnshire, even suffered a health scare when he fell ill in his hotel in Burma’s former capital Rangoon, after an unsuccessful £1million excavation was called off on Friday.

The grandfather of five, who has now visited Burma 18 times, believes that 36 spitfires were shipped there from Solihull, West Midlands, but arrived in August 1945, after the Japanese had surrendered.

The story goes that because the crates
 arrived too late, they were buried underground in unmarked graves - and
 in any event were never required for the Cold War, reported the Sunday 
Telegraph.

Mr Cundall got the information in 1996
 from Jim Pearce, then 67, a ‘warbird’ finder from Worthing, West 
Sussex, who had spoken two decades earlier to an American he met in 
Jacksonville, Florida.

According to the Sunday Telegraph, the
 US Construction Battalion member had told Mr Pearce:  ‘We did some 
pretty silly things. But the silliest was burying some of your 
Spitfires.’

Mr Cundall wanted to find out more and
 got a response to an advert placed in an aircraft magazine from Stan 
Coombe, 70, of Eastbourne, East Sussex, who had fought in Burma during 
the war.

Excavation: Heavy diggers were brought in to help with the search for the buried Spitfires but archaeologists now believe there is no evidence support the claim that the rare aircraft are buried there

He claimed to have seen 20 Americans 
gently lowering six 30ft crates into a ditch near Mingaladon - and asked 
an airman what they were. He claimed the man responded: 'Would you 
believe, Spitfires?'

'I believe the Spitfires are here and I’m not going to give up. Spitfires are held in very high regard. They saved our necks in the Battle of Britain and are very precious'

But despite various attempts, Mr Cundall has still found nothing in his digs - 7,000 miles from home.

Last week the farmer and aviation 
enthusiast, who has dedicated 16 years of his life searching for the 
‘lost’ aircraft, was taken to hospital, treated for high blood pressure 
and advised not to fly.

But last night he was preparing to 
board a plane to travel 900 miles to the civil-war-torn city of Myitkina
 in the north of Burma, where he plans to begin a second dig almost 
single-handedly.

Precious: Up to 136 Spitfires, worth up to £1.5million each, are rumoured to have been buried in crates in three locations around Burma at the end of the Second World War (file photo)

He had worked in searing 95F heat at 
the Rangoon excavation site, an old British airfield, before the project
 was declared a failure after archaeologists with him concluded there 
was nothing to find.

But Mr Cundall said: ‘I believe the 
Spitfires are here and I’m not going to give up. Spitfires are held in 
very high regard. They saved our necks in the Battle of Britain and are 
very precious.’

Up to 136 of the aircraft, worth up to
 £1.5million each, are rumoured to have been buried in crates in three 
locations around Burma at the end of the Second World War.

The British are said to have hidden the planes to prevent them falling into enemy hands.
