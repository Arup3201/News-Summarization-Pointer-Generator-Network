David Cameron today came under pressure over reports the NHS faces a £2billion financial black hole.

The Prime Minister was challenged over reports of a cash shortage in the health service in England which is heaping pressure on staff and putting care at risk.

NHS managers warned the service is ‘experiencing some of the most pressured times of its existence so far’.

David Cameron told the Commons that the efficiency savings needed in the NHS were on track

The NHS's secondary healthcare budget in England, which includes money for hospital and mental health services, is £78 billion.

But analysis of figures from the health regulator Monitor suggest that in 2015-16 there will be a funding gap of £5.1 billion.

Even after all realistic efficiency savings are made there will still be a deficit of £1.6bn for 2015-16, according to the BBC analysis.

In the Commons today, Mr Cameron insisted the NHS is on track to make £20 billion in planned efficiency savings.

He told MPs: ‘The estimates being made today are being made on the basis that we have set challenges for the NHS in terms of making efficiencies.

‘They have met those efficiency challenges every single year under this Government and that money has been ploughed back into better patient care in our NHS.’

Labour's Andy Burnham said the NHS's finances were on a 'knife-edge'

But Labour said that the health service's finances are on a ‘knife-edge’ as a result of the controversial NHS reforms.

Shadow health secretary Andy Burnham said: ‘David Cameron chose to put NHS finances on this knife-edge when he wasted £3 billion on a damaging re-organisation and clawed back a further £3 billion to the Treasury in recent years. That is why the NHS is in a such a fragile financial position.’

Christina McAnea, head of health at the union Unison, said: 'The prospect of a further £2 billion cut in the NHS budget is a real blow for patients and staff.

‘The Government can't expect staff to plug this hole in NHS funding by cutting pay and conditions even further.

‘Starving NHS budgets further will have a significant and noticeable impact on patient care, staff training and hospital infrastructure.

‘The NHS is already under strain because of rising demand and the high cost of expensive drugs and treatments.’

The NHS Confederation, which represents health organisations across England, called for a 10-year funding settlement for the NHS to protect NHS funding in real terms for the next decade.

Chief operating officer Matt Tee said: 'There is no doubt that the health service is experiencing some of the most pressured times of its existence so far.

'What we really need is for the NHS to have some certainty about the funding it will get in future years, so health service leaders can plan most effectively with their populations how to deliver the right services, in the right places, for the best value.’

A Department of Health spokesman said: 'The NHS is on track to make £20 billion savings this Parliament and we are confident that it will continue to make the savings necessary which will be reinvested to front line care to meet the rising demands of our ageing population.'
