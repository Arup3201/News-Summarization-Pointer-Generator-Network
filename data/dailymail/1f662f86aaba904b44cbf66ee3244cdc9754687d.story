A paralysed man had a shock when he saw a nasty note left on his car for parking in a handicapped parking spot.

Matt Milstead, 36, had parked in the spot before going to play a game of wheelchair rugby at a YMCA in Grand Rapids, Michigan.

When Milstead, who is quadriplegic, returned, he found an anonymous handwritten note left in the door handle of his BMW.

The letter said: ‘I would love to see 
your wheelchair! I'm guessing male 25-35 years professional who thinks 
he's got the world by the ass. But I could be wrong.’

Shocking: Matt Milstead, 36, right, with his wife, Leslie, left, found an angry handwritten note on his car because he had parked in a handicapped parking spot

The note: An angry message from a passer-by who saw the BMW parked in a handicapped parking spot

Milstead, who works for the Social Security Administration, said he was surprised and confused by the note.

‘I was kind of puzzled why he would leave this note and never met me, didn't know if I was in a wheelchair or not, but he just assumed I was just someone who tried to steal a close and convenient spot,’ he told Wood TV 8.

His wife, Leslie Milstead, however, was furious by the incident and decided to act.

‘It's kind of ironic the guy was trying to right a wrong. He assumed some jerk had parked in a handicapped spot that shouldn't be, and so he was really trying.

'He probably felt like a good person and thought he was doing a good thing, but the problem is he was wrong,’ Mrs Milstead told Wood TV 8.

The right to park: Milstead has a handicapped parking pass hanging in the window of his car

Protective: Milstead's wife, Leslie, was furious by the note. She wrote an angry message to the culprit telling him her husband is paralysed

She wrote a sharply-worded message on Facebook aimed at the culprit, saying: ‘You were so close on the age, he's actually 36, and he is a professional with a full time job.

‘He is also a quadriplegic, which for him means that he can no longer move his legs or his fingers in either hand. He has no grip.

‘So, if you are willing to give him your functioning hands and legs for the rest of your life in exchange for his 6-year-old BMW and handicapped parking pass, I'm sure he'd make that trade.’

Mrs Milstead then writes: ‘Why are you 
so confident that a handicapped person couldn't be a hard worker who is 
successful and owns a nice vehicle?

Nice car: Milstead drives a BMW. Here he manages to get into the car with his wheelchair

Upsetting: Milstead says he was 'kind of puzzled' why someone would leave the note on his car

In the parking lot: Milstead was playing wheelchair rugby at this YMCA in Grand Rapids, Michigan, when the incident occurred

She says later in the message that her husband ‘just shakes his head at people like you who leave notes on his car. Trust me, you aren't the first. Ignorance is everywhere’.

Mrs Milstead finishes the message by urging the person who left the note to look her husband up on Facebook to ‘see lots of pictures of that wheelchair you had questions about’.

The post prompted a ripple of reactions on Facebook who are shocked about the incident.

'There are more people that think this way than you would believe,' says one comment.

Another says: 'Well said that was an amazing response, there should be more people like you in this world advocating for those in wheelchairs like myself. Just like Matt I just shake people like that off, but well done!!'
