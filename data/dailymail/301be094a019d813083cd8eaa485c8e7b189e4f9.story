She has worked as a model for thirty years and her career shows no signs of slowing.

And Yasmin Le Bon proves her worth once more in stunning new pictures for bohemian High Street label Monsoon.

The Iranian-British model and mother-of-three models an eclectic collection of knitwear, scarves and daywear for the second season running.

Bohemian, eclectic and comfortable: Iranian-British Le Bon models the new collection

She is pictured walking through country fields, around stone buildings and by a rocky stream on the Cawdor Estate in the Scottish Highlands as the face of the British brand's AW13 campaign.

The
model, who has graced the covers of over 400 magazines, makes her 
campaign return in the beautiful shoot wearing a rich colour palette of 
natural wool blends and delicate, embellished fabrics.

The campaign clearly expresses Monsoon’s folkloric and Fabergé-inspired direction this season.

Le Bon continues to grace the pages of fashion bibles Vogue and Harper’s Bazaar and returns as the face of the London-based global inspired brand, following in the steps of former Monsoon supermodels Rosie Huntington-Whiteley, Lily Donaldson and Alessandra Ambrosio.

In an interview for the campaign, Le Bon says she relies on 'lots of very fine pashminas, serious 
moisturisers, sturdy boots, four wheel drive and a cashmere coat' when it's cold outside. Though she does confess she hasn't 'quite cracked' the trick of staying stylist and warm.

'I love a really sharp 
well-tailored coat and have always had a penchant for riding boots, even
though i don't actually ride,' she says.

A self-confessed city girl, Le Bon says she 'dreams of fields and wild walks'.

'I have a very romantic view of country life. Doesn't everybody want to secretly be a farmer?' she says.

Cold air and heating can play havoc with skin, but the 48-year-old isn't a fan of using beauty tricks to keep the elements at bay.

'I
love the elements actually,' she says.

'I think we should embrace them rather than 
see them as a challenge, which could also be because I am really lazy; 
mind you a good moisturiser is always handy.'

She says that while she doesn't follow fashion trends so much, she will be 'chanelling her inner rock chick' this season.

When asked how she prefers to stay warm, Le Bon says she is a layering kind of girl. '...but I am really beginning
to love that one great big chunky jumper, it can hide all sorts of 
things.'

In terms of the colour palette of her seasonal wardrobes, Le Bon confesses sh doesn't change it up very much.

'I have been trying to make more of an effort in the winter to introduce a bit of colour, it can really make a difference to your mood,' she says.

Le Bon's favourite pieces 
from the shoot were 
the short grey/beige embellished rock and roll jacket, the cream chunky 
Aran cardigan and the beige long cardigan.

When discussing her experience of the shoot, Le Bon confesses Inverness was not the easiest location.

'It was so incredibly beautiful up there, just stunning, but the weather was really changeable.

'I
think having all the different elements of weather thrown at us within a
twenty minute window was quite memorable and quite challenging to shoot
in.'

The AW13 campaign launches in stores and in print in September 2013.
