Forget Captain Kirk and his Starship Enterprise. Buzz-off Buzz Lightyear. And Star Wars Jedi knight  Luke Skywalker can take a galactic hike too.

Make way instead for the first real interplanetary spaceman superhero who arguably inspired them all - Britain’s home-grown, lantern-jawed pilot of the future Dan Dare.

For today the firm most famous for its car-repair manuals is publishing the nuts-and-bolts inside track into the technology that propelled him through the solar system to worlds far beyond our own.

Pilot of the future: Haynes has published a manual revealing the technology that propelled Dan Dare to worlds far beyond our own, inspiring legions of fans along the way

Haynes Publishing's 'Dan Dare Pilot of the Future - Space Fleet Operations Manual' is an engrossing labour of love from a team clearly devoted to the legacy of a hero who inspired a generation – in the hope that he may do so anew. It includes work from some of the original artists, as well as updated cutaways of space-craft, kit and weaponry that remain true to the original spirit.

For a generation of post-war children - largely though not exclusively schoolboys - Dan Dare’s interplanetary adventures were a vibrant and exotic escape from the grey austerity and rationing that persisted long after global hostilities ended.

From the moment the first Dan Dare strip blasted off in full colour on the front of the revolutionary new Eagle comic on Friday April 14, 1950 – priced at ‘3d’, or one and a half pence in  today’s currency - the future never looked brighter. It caused a sensation and sold nearly a million.

The Anastasia: The new manual from Haynes gives an insight into the technology that powered Dan Dare's personal spacecraft, the Anastasia

Formidable flagship: The manual also focuses on the spacecraft used by rebel leader Tharl in the legendary Eagle comic

The Eagle comic was the brainchild of former RAF chaplain and parish vicar, the Rev. Marcus Morris,  who wanted to create a morally-uplifting but no less interesting comic for children which their parents wouldn’t frown on and ban.

But it was artist Frank Hampson who created Dan Dare and assembled around him a team working at fever pitch in Epsom, Surrey, to script his stories, design his space-craft and gadgets and bring the character and his adventures to life.

Hampson used family, friends and colleagues to pose up in costumes for photographs which formed the basis of the finished drawn strips.

Legendary: The Eagle comic was a must-read for a generation of post-war children in Britain

But it wasn’t pure fantasy, with as much care taken with the science - as far as was known or hinted at at the time - as with the fiction. With hindsight there are some howlers, but most are forgivable and pale in significance to the majesty of the illustrations. Arthur C. Clarke, who would become the author of ‘2001, A Space Odyssey’ is said to have been a scientific advisor.

Originally conceived as a space 
chaplain complete with dog collar, Dan Dare emerged finally in print as 
chief pilot for the Interplanet Space Fleet on an a somewhat idealised 
planet Earth featuring a United Nations-inspired world government, glass
 domed cities, and beautiful garden landscape. But there were also 
problems. Dare’s first  mission was to Venus to find food for a starving
 earth with a booming population explosion.

Dare's exploits were serialised on Radio Luxembourg, which aired The New Adventures of Dan Dare, Pilot of the Future, five times a week for five years from July 1951.

The
 back story is no less fascinating. In this alternative modern history 
of the known universe, it was Britain which won the space race, building
 on Germany’s wartime V2 rocket programme to pip the U.S. to land the 
first man on the Moon and plant the Union Flag on its lunar surface.

Later the UK was part of a joint mission to Mars with the Americans, using three spacecraft called Winston Churchill, Franklin Roosevelt  and Charles de Gaulle after the three allied leaders during the Second World War.

As the uniforms suggest, the Space 
Fleet is a thinly disguised but updated version of the RAF, with green 
rather than blue colouring.

Our
 hero, Manchester-born and Cambridge-educated Colonel Daniel MacGregor 
Dare, with his distinctive wiggly eyebrow, embodies the true Brit spirit
 of heroism, fair play, and an inner moral strength – always willing to 
give even his worst enemies a second chance.The
 manual includes profiles of his closest friends and colleagues – alien 
as well as human. Central among them are  - for the time a gender 
stereotype-defying breakthrough – a smart, intelligent, brave and 
resourceful scientific space-woman and nutritionist, Professor Jocelyn 
Peabody, whose quick-thinking and fluency in alien languages ‘saves 
lives'.

And not 
forgetting his loyal side-kick Digby, a down-to-earth father of four 
from Wigan in Lancashire, who steadfastly refuses promotion to stay at 
his friend’s side in space.

Dan Dare manual author Rod Barzilay,
 66, admits to having been a fan since boyhood. In the small-print of 
the acknowledgments he gives a salute to Sue, ‘my long suffering wife 
who became a  Dan Dare widow for most of the time I was scribbling 
away'.He says: ’Eagle 
took the world of children’s publishing by storm. But the feature that 
really  caught everyone’s attention, and was to inspire a whole 
generation of future artists, writers and even scientists, was the Dan 
Dare Pilot of the Future science-fiction strip.

The Tempus Frangit: Dan Dare fans can immerse themselves in the space pilot's world once again thanks to the new manual

McHoo Asteroid Base: Dan Dare first blasted off on the front cover of the new Eagle comic in April 1950

‘It was superbly drawn and scripted and based on science facts of the time, with imaginative innovations thrown in for good measure. Hampson and his team realistically portrayed future equipment and inventions, kindling the imagination of its readers and encouraging a widespread hankering for space travel and interplanetary adventure’

Mr Barzilay went on: ’At the time post-war Britain was full of optimism for a better and brighter future.

'The Festival of Britain was being prepared, the aviation industry was about to steal a world lead with its Comet jet aircraft , and the country was entering upon a boom age which would prompt Prime Minister Harold Macmillan to famously state ‘our people have never had it so good'.

‘So to many of us space travel felt just around the corner and Hampson’s exciting ideas didn’t seem far-fetched at all’.

Labour of love: The 66-year-old author of the manual, Ron Barzilay, has been a fan of Dan Dare, his loyal pal Digby and arch enemy The Mekon since he was a young boy

The Zylbat: The manual features pictures of the spacecraft used by Dan and his loyal sidekick, Digby, as they journeyed through galaxies

M.E.K.I Space Station: The superbly drawn comic was based on scientific facts as they were at the time

The manual looks at the characters 
and technology. It includes cutaways and details of Dan Dare’s own 
personal two-seater space-craft, the Anastasia, which was ‘designed and 
built in 1997’ using alien technology as a special thank you gift.

It has four different propulsion 
systems including jet-power to fly, magnetic motors to hover, rocket 
boosters and revolutionary ‘impulse drive’, similar to what would emerge
 later in Star trek as ‘warp drive.’

Indeed
 many technologies which appeared in Star Trek in the mid 1960s had 
their first outing in Dan Dare more than a decade earlier. For example, 
‘Beam me up Scottie’ became a catch-phrase in the transporter room of 
the Starship Enterprise.

Dan fans: The new manual from Haynes, seen above left and right, looks at all the characters and technology that captivated Dan Dare fans in post-war Britain

But
 the teleportation technology was seen as early as 1950 in Dan Dare 
where it was called a ‘telesender’ - technology which scrambled and 
unscrambled atoms to send people vast distances.

Space hero: Dan Dare can count Monty Python's Michael Palin and Terry Jones, as well as musical maestro Sir Tim Rice among his fans

Hampson, who died in 1985 aged 66, 
commented in later life that Star trek had ‘really cleaned out’ Dan 
Dare’s technology cupboard of ideas.

Dan
 Dare’s arch enemy is the Mekon, the green-skinned, dome-headed but 
small-bodied leader of the war-like Treens who inhabit Venus.

The
 manual notes: ’A Mekon takes 50 years to mature and lives for 300 
years.

'He moves around by means of a personal flying chair that has been
 armoured against all known hand weapons.

It goes on: ‘He is ruthless in his 
dealings with those  who fail him, destroying any who don’t deliver and 
has proved very elusive when things go against him. A number of times he
 has been presumed dead, only to resurface again.’

Dan Dare inspired a legion of avid 
fans including Monty Python’s Michael Palin and Terry Jones, who said: 
’The combination of fantasy and humour, for me, was irresistible. I was 
hooked. It was pure genius.’

And
 musical maestro and song lyricist Sir Tim Rice, who had copies of the 
Eagle shipped over to him while a child living in Japan in the 1950s, 
said: ‘Dan remains an human and likeable character, an emblem of the 
optimism, straight-forward and culturally confident Britain of the 1950s
 which lives on in Dan Dare’s future, but sadly never made it in ours.’

As
 author Rod Barzilay concludes: ’Dan’s story has now become the future 
of an exciting parallel universe rather than our own.

'It nevertheless 
remains a fascinating place to be explored.’

Dan Dare's original home the Eagle was published from 1950 to 1969, before being relaunched in a new format from 1982 to 1994.

The
 space hero has also appeared in Revolver and the Planet, and was at the
 centre of a seven-issue mini-series published by Virgin Comics in 2008.

The strip has also appeared in Spaceship Away magazine, which was launched in 2003 and continues today.
