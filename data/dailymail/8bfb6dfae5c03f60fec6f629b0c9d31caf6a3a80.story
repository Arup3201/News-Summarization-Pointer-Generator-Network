A friend recently asked where he should take his (second) wife on honeymoon. Without much hesitation, I suggested Ponta dos Ganchos in southern Brazil. Just one problem. I had not been there.

My punt was based on pretty pictures on the internet and a feeling that Brazil in general has become one of the world’s hottest destinations (even though things have turned tricky in the build-up to the World Cup).

It also filled me with a keen ambition to see this splendid retreat for myself.

Paradise: Ponta dos Ganchos in Southern Brazil is a 25-bungalow beach resort where staff outnumber guests three to one

So, here I am — on the expansive terrace of bungalow 24 (excuse the name-dropping, but Paul McCartney has stayed in the bungalow next door), watching an old fishing boat chugging across a bay that looks more like a giant lake than the Atlantic Ocean.

A range of hills is silhouetted on the horizon, two vultures are circling high above in the blue sky, and my own wife is splashing about in the infinity plunge pool, proffering insights such as: ‘Oh, my God, this is unbelievable!’

She is right, as usual.

This beautiful and tranquil spot has managed to remain off the radar of discerning British travellers despite occupying a privately owned peninsula, about 20 miles south of Florianopolis

This is an extraordinarily beautiful and tranquil spot, one which somehow has managed to remain off the radar of discerning British travellers despite occupying a privately owned peninsula, about 20 miles south of Florianopolis in Santa Catarina, for more than 12 years.

It is surrounded by the sea, and is hidden on a hill where every tree and shrub seems to be blooming with unbridled happiness. There are only 25 bungalows poking out from the lush greenery, each completely private, many with hammocks on the terrace, some with pools or hot tubs.

There is a private beach, and across from the restaurant there is a little island where my friend and his blushing bride will be served dinner surrounded by hundreds of dancing candles.

The two main investors — one from Uruguay, the other from Britain — wanted to launch a hotel that had only one rule: there should be no rules.

Breakfast, lunch or dinner? The only rule is that there are no rules and guests can eat whatever, whenever they want

This means breakfast is available all day, dinner all night. You wear what you like when you like, and even if you never want to emerge from your bungalow, the charming staff — nearly all of whom come from the fishing village at the bottom of the hill — will miraculously tidy up without you noticing.

Santa Catarina is unlike anywhere else in Brazil. There are native Germans, Italians, Poles, Russians, Japanese, Greeks, Irish, Indians, Africans and many more — most of whom arrived during the 19th century, lured by the lucrative whaling business and the opportunity for new beginnings.

Those employed at Ponta dos Ganchos have impeccable manners and out-number guests by almost three to one. Some of them float around as if in a state of higher consciousness, imbuing the whole place with an irresistible Zen-like ambience. But they wear it all so lightly — just as the whole resort plays down its home-made eco system, its strict recycling policy, its quiet sophistication.

You can fish, play tennis, work out in the gym (if you must), go rafting, kayaking and snorkelling, watch movies in the private cinema, or do nothing except listen to the creaking bamboos when the wind blows.

Ponta dos Ganchos is part of the Relais & Chateaux group, which is generally indication that the food will be top-notch. It is — and it’s different, too.

On offer at breakfast is a tasting menu that changes every day, comprising ten exquisite little offerings, from a shot of pineapple, coconut water and mint juice to miniature goat cheese-and-herb omelettes in little shells.

Bathroom with a view: The bungalows all feature phenomenal views out to sea

Oysters and mussels — harvested locally — are available around the clock, and the baked sea bass dissolves in your mouth like butter, but with fewer calories. At dinner, there are French, American and Portuguese influences and the Brazilian wines are sensational.

According to legend, Ganchos de Fora — as the village is called — was named after Captain Hook, referred to as Captain Ganchos (gancho means ‘hook’ in Portuguese). Another theory is that the name derives from the special hooks used by local fishermen.

One morning, a member of staff takes us on a trail which ends up on a beach that is only accessible on foot. Here, we find two surfers bobbing up and down in the water, and hundreds of crabs scurrying around as if enjoying their own carnival.

That evening, rain hammers down. We go to the beach. Forget Singin’ In The Rain — Swimmin’ In The Rain hits all the right notes and feels like a holy baptism of sorts. We are joined by gulls dive-bombing the water in search of a few tiddlers for supper.

I read somewhere that Brazilian hospitality can be separated into two categories: before your stay at Ponta dos Ganchos, and after. This could well be right. What I know for sure is that my honeymoon recommendation is utterly brilliant.

The Ultimate Travel Company (020 3051 8098,

Ganchos from £2,850 pp. A seven-night stay in a beachside cabana comes
