U.S. health regulators have recommended that healthcare professionals stop prescribing combination drugs that contain more than 325 milligrams of acetaminophen per tablet, capsule, or other dosage unit, citing the risk of liver damage.

One of the most commonly used drugs in the country, acetaminophen, is widely used in both prescription and over-the-counter products to reduce pain and fever.

Limiting the quantity per dosage unit will reduce the risk of inadvertent overdose, which can lead to liver failure, liver transplant and death, said the Food and Drug Administration.

U.S. health regulators have recommended that healthcare professionals stop prescribing combination drugs that contain more than 325 milligrams of acetaminophen including Panadol

It cited the fact that no available data
 showed that taking more than the recommended dose provided benefits 
that outweighed the added risks.

Inadvertent overdose from combination drugs containing acetaminophen - known as paracetamol in other countries - accounts for nearly half of all cases of acetaminophen-related liver failure in the United States, the agency said.

'Acetaminophen overdose is one of the most common poisonings worldwide,' according to the National Institutes of Health.Â 

Combination acetaminophen products are commonly prescribed to patients to treat pain from acute injuries, post-operative pain, or pain following dental procedures.

It is commonly used in pain 
medications with opioids such as oxycodone (Percocet), hydrocodone 
(Vicodin) and codeine (Tylenol with Codeine).

In January 2011, the FDA asked manufacturers of combination drugs containing acetaminophen, sold globally under trade names such as Tylenol and Panadol, to limit acetaminophen doses to no more than 325 mg in each tablet or capsule by January 14, 2014.

Some of these products still remain available, the agency said.

The FDA also suggested that pharmacists who receive a prescription for a combination product with more than the recommended dose contact the prescriber to discuss using a lower dose.

In the near future, the FDA plans to institute proceedings to withdraw approval for combination drugs that remain on the market, it said in a statement.

The FDA has set the recommended maximum for adults at 4,000 milligrams per day, but it is easier to reach this limit than you might think - with a single gel tablet of Extra Strength Tylenol containing 500 mg.

Consumers should not take more than the prescribed dose of any medication that contains acetaminophen, according to the FDA, and should avoid taking more than one acetaminophen product at a time.

Drinking alcohol while taking acetaminophen also puts you at risk.

The warning does not apply to over-the-counter drugs such as Tylenol, which contains acetaminophen. The FDA said it will address these products in another regulatory action.
