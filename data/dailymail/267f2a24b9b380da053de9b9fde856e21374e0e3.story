When one 16-year-old American schoolboy asked his father to stop accompanying him to the bus stop to wave him off to school, his parent was less than impressed.

The boy, named Rain, had begged his mother Rochelle: 'Don't let Dad go out there again'. But his father Dale had another solution in mind - a different fancy dress costume for every day of the year.

Much to Rain's horror, Dale proceeded to show up at the bus stop dressed in a variety of amusing costumes, among them a mermaid, Wonder Woman and even a bride.

So dedicated was Dale to inflicting maximum embarrassment on his son, he even turned up in a toga and sitting on the toilet. Despite his son's embarrassment, as these hilarious snaps, compiled by Awkward Family Photos, reveal, he certainly seemed to enjoy the experience.
