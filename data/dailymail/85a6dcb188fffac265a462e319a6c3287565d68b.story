One of Britain’s most popular online bookmakers has been branded a ‘rip-off company’ after failing to honour odds offered during a crucial Chelsea match.

Furious customers are demanding a bigger payout after placing wagers with Sky Bet that the London side would be knocked out of the Champions League by Paris Saint- Germain on Wednesday night.

The firm’s mobile phone app was offering odds of 25-1 for a PSG win in extra time – but when it came to settling the bets, they paid out at just 9-2. It means the winnings for a £10 wager would have been cut from £260 to £55, including the return of the original stake.

Sky Bet claims the better odds were offered by ‘mistake’ – and its actions are in keeping with the small print in its terms and conditions

Sky Bet claims the better odds were offered by ‘mistake’ – and its actions are in keeping with the small print in its terms and conditions.

The longer odds were offered while Chelsea were leading 2-1 in extra time. But the French side equalised, despite being reduced to ten men, and won the two-legged clash on away goals.

Punters who successfully bet on the result were told they would be paid less than they expected only after the match was over, with an email sent from the company blaming an ‘administration error’.

Emil Bolstad, 26, was expecting to win £150 plus his £6 stake back – but profited by only £27. He said: ‘It’s false advertising. I made the bet based on 25-1 odds, not 9-2. It was only when it came time to pay up that I noticed the odds had changed.

‘If they can do this because of an “error”, they can do it for all their odds. They could triple their odds and after people have bet say, “Oh no, it was a mistake” and not pay out.’

Labour MP Graham Jones called the move 'outrageous'

Labour MP Graham Jones said: ‘This is outrageous. What would have happened if a rival firm had better odds but people chose Sky Bet because of the 25-1 odds? Customers would have lost out. You can’t change the price after the sale.

‘Sky Bet are clearly a rip-off company who are willing to take their customers to the cleaners and deceive them. This is typical of the gambling industry.’

Sky Bet’s managing director Richard Flint said the longer odds were ‘clearly’ wrong. He said: ‘Occasionally mistakes happen. In this case a wrong price was displayed for around three minutes, and a small number of customers bet at the incorrect odds.

These odds were clearly wrong – we showed odds of 25-1 when the true odds and the odds displayed by all other bookmakers was 9-2. We settled at the correct odds.’

The terms and conditions for the Sky Bet app – which has been downloaded 700,000 times on to iPhones and iPads – reserve the right to ‘correct obvious errors and either settle bets at the correct odds or void bets’.
