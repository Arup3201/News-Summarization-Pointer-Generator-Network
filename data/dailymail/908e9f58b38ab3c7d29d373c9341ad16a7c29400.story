‘For a man who likes electric cars he sure burns a lot of rocket fuel.’

These were the words of Lisa Simpson to Elon Musk in his guest appearance on The Simpsons, humourously citing a supposed conflict of interest between his companies Tesla and SpaceX.

But in a series of tweets Mr Musk has hit back at the opinionated cartoon character, explaining why rockets in their current form are the only way to reach orbit.

South African-born Elon Musk has responded to comments made by Lisa Simpson. He appeared in the latest episode of the Simpsons on 25 January, pictured here in a still from the episode with the Simpsons family. In the episode Lisa cites a potential conflict of interest between his electric car company Tesla and SpaceX

The episode, called 'The Musk who fell to Earth', aired on 25 January.

Towards the end of the episode, Mr Musk takes off in one of SpaceX's Dragon spacecraft, leading Lisa to make her remark.

But responding to the jibe, South African-born Musk said in a tweet: ‘If u saw @TheSimpsons and wonder why @SpaceX doesn't use an electric rocket to reach orbit, it is cuz that is impossible.’

In September last year, dreams of taking an elevator into space were given a boost after researchers created ultra-thin, super-strong nanothreads made from diamonds.

The threads are made up of a long, thin strand of carbon atoms arranged in the same way as the inside of a diamond.

The discovery could finally be the breakthrough needed to hoist and support cosmic elevators that would transport people into the atmosphere.

The research was carried out by John Badding, a professor of chemistry at Penn State University, and the findings were published in the journal Nature Materials. 

He went on to say the reason is Newton’s Third Law, which states that for every action there is an equal and opposite reaction.

‘In a vacuum, there is nothing to “push” against. You must react against ejected mass,’ he continued.

Ever since the first rockets launched in the mid-20th century, people have wondered if there might be an easier way to reach orbit.

People have dreamed up space elevators, ‘cannons’ that could launch vehicles into orbit or electric ion thrusters to slowly raise a spacecraft above Earth’s atmosphere.

But as Mr Musk explains, none of these technologies are advanced enough yet to be a feasible alternative to rockets.

In particular, space elevators have often been seen as a ‘holy grail’ of reaching orbit, but no one has yet developed a material that could withstand the huge strain of holding itself together - let alone lift anything into orbit. 

‘[Please] don’t ask me about space elevators until someone at least builds a carbon nanotube structure longer than a footbridge,’ said Mr Musk.

Responding to Lisa's jibe on twitter, Mr Musk said rockets were the only way to currently reach orbit. He said other methods like electric power were simply 'impossible'. And other proposals like space elevators or railguns were not technologically feasible yet

Elon Musk is CEO of company SpaceX, which builds and operates the Falcon series of rockets, in addition to the Dragon spacecraft. Pictured is a Falcon 9 rocket lifting off from Space Launch Complex 40 at the Cape Canaveral Air Force Station in Florida on 10 January 2015

Mr Musk is also CEO of electric car company Tesla, leading Lisa to cite the supposed public of interest with his gas-guzzling rockets. However, as he points out, it's simply not possible to produce an environmentally friendly way of reaching Earth orbit yet, and rockets are the best way to get into space for now

Elon Musk is the founder of electric car maker Tesla, and space exploration firm SpaceX.

The South African-born entrepreneur immigrated to Canada at age 17.

He then moved to America to study at the University of Pennsylvania.

Mr Musk made his first fortune by helping set up money service PayPal.

In September, SpaceX won a $1.6 billion contract with Nasa to resupply the International Space Station with its rockets and launchers.

In August 2013, Mr Musk unveiled plans for a Hyperloop system that would offer a faster way to travel between Los Angeles and San Francisco.

Mr Musk described the concept as a subsonic air travel machine that would stretch approximately 350 miles (560 km).

It theoretically would let commuters travel between the cities in 30 minutes or less.

He also has plans to colonise Mars and has even said he wants retire on the red planet. 

Ion thrusters, meanwhile, are a means of electric propulsion employed on some spacecraft.

Rather than ejecting chemical propellant like a regular rocket, they accelerate ions to create a slow but steady thrust.

They are used on some spacecraft, such as Nasa’s Dawn probe currently on its way to the dwarf planet Ceres, as they can provide sustainable propulsion over a long period of time.

However, their rate of acceleration is comparable to the pressure a piece of paper exerts on your hand.

Over time, this can accelerate a spacecraft to great speeds - but it is simply not possible to use such an engine to launch a rocket on earth

‘Ion thrusters are great, but have extremely tiny force (photon thruster even less). Must have more thrust than weight or you don't go up,’ said Mr Musk.

And as his final rebuttal, on whether a space cannon could be used to fire a vehicle into space, he said: ‘Anything launched by a railgun (if you could ever reach ~ Mach 27) would explode upon exiting the barrel in our dense atmosphere.’
