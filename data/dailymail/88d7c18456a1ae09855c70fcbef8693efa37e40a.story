Britain's only rumpologist - a person who reads people's bottoms - has appeared on live television to analyse the derrieres of celebrities including actress Kelly Brook and singer Rihanna.

Sam Amos joined Holly Willoughby and Dermot O'Leary on ITV's This Morning today to explain how she learns about a person's character by examining their rears, in the same way a palm reader might better understand someone by looking at their hands.

When asked what exactly she sees in a person's bottom, Amos said: 'It tells me about the character of a person, the good points and the bad points.'

She then went on to predict big changes for Kelly Brook, including the possibility of a relocation to America and a new relationship.

This Morning presenters Holly Willoughby and Dermot O'Leary were confused by Sam Amos' revelations

She said: 'Kelly went through a big transition last year. A painful one. And I think she's now ready for a new romance in her life.'

Looking at the photograph of Kelly, Holly quickly interjected with: 'What told you that? Google?'

Amos replied: 'No, it's the right cheek that was telling me all the past things, the 
left cheek tells all the future things. It's telling me she might go to 
America and even settle down there.'

Moving on to a photograph of Rihanna's posterior, Amos said: 'Well, she's quite a feisty lady, and I would say a perfectionist.

'I
 would say she's quite happy as well, and also that she'll get broody 
soon because one of her friends is going to have a baby girl. I would 
also say she's going to do more charity work, which will change her 
life in some way.'

Sam Amos talks Holly and Dermot through rumpology while looking at the bottom belonging to the first volunteer

Volunteer one was Souli Roots from X Factor, who was told her bottom made her seem fun and not too serious

Holly and Dermot then asked Amos to read three mystery celebrity that were protruding through three holes in a wall.

About the first one she said: 'This person is very outgoing, has gone thjrough a transition as well, i8s very creative and very fun to be around. They can be a bit serious at times, but not too serious.'

Holly quickly added: 'Well, she is on national television with her bottom poked through a hole, so she can't be that serious.

The volunteer turned out to be X Factor contestent Souli Roots, who said Amos was spot-on.

TOWIE's Bobby - who is a Gok Wan lookalike - was the second mystery bottom

Celebrity transsexual Lauren Harries appeared in front of the screen as the third mystery bottom

Reading the second volunteer's rear, Amos said: 'This person likes tattoos for special occasions and likes to be outside a lot. I get that from the left cheek. I'm not sure if they're a presenter or a comedian. I get that fun to be around thing.'

The volunteer was revealed as TOWIE 'Gok Wannabe' Bobby Cole Norris, who was moderately impressed but said he really preferred hotels to being outside.

When it came to the third one, Amos said: 'I'm a bit all over the place with this one. I think they're going through quite an emotional time. They like to be in control, they are a bit of comedian, they like to play pranks on people.'

When celebrity transsexual Lauren Harries stepped out from behind the wall she agreed that she did like to be in control but was not really a prankster.

Jackie Stallone does rump readings

Sylvester Stallone's mother Jacqueline, who appeared on Celebrity Big Brother in 2005, is one of America's foremost rumpologists.

She believes that rump reading is an art that was practiced in ancient Babylon, India, Greece, and Rome, considering the rear to be the key to health and fidelity, and what determined potential talents and future success.

'Rumpology is the art of reading the lines, crevices, dimples, and folds of the buttocks to divine the individual's character and gain an understanding of what has occurred in the past and get a prediction of the future.'

Jacqueline has discovered that the left and right cheeks reveal a person's past and future, respectively.

The right buttocks represents the left cerebral hemisphere of the brain, while the left buttocks represents the right hemisphere. It is similar to palmistry -- where the left palmÂ  represents the past and the right palm represents the future. A rump report from Jacqueline Stallone can tell you whether you are going "ass-backwards" or eyes open into the future.
