Huge plant pots have been branded a danger to both drivers and pedestrians after they were dumped on a busy road by a council in an attempt to slow down traffic.

Brighton and Hove City Council installed the four large planters on Viaduct Road in Brighton, East Sussex, after some residents raised concerns that cars were travelling too fast.

But the move has sparked anger from residents who claim the new additions to their street cause cars to violently swerve  to avoid the plant pots.

Chris Morford, who uses the road on his daily commute, said: 'These planters are a danger, causing cars to swerve.

'If there is a speed issue let us have details of the number of complaints.

'If there is a realistic number then enforce the 20mph speed limit.'

A report presented to London Road Local Action Team said the road was used by 11,200 vehicles per day - and more than half were driving at over 30mph.

Brighton and Hove City councillor Ken Norman said the planters were a 'crazy and very dangerous addition to this heavily used road.'

Businesswoman Sue Addis, who uses the road every day, said: 'It's just ridiculous. There's not enough room for two cars anyway.

'Will they be planted up with palm trees to make the entrance to our city more attractive with a tropical feel?

'Or is it a new game of swerve and bump to keep us all going at 20 miles an hour?'

The council said the measures were experimental and there were currently no plans for permanent plant pots to be installed.

Brighton and Hove City Council's road safety manager, Martin Heath, added: 'Further softening of the traffic environment through planting can create strong visual clues about the residential nature of the street.

'Following some local public utility work last weekend, which resulted in the closure of a traffic lane, we took the opportunity to introduce some planters.

'The aim was to determine the impact that such measures might have on speeds, again to inform decisions about measures later on.

'At this stage, other than an objective to reduce excessive traffic speeds, there are no specific plans for any types of measures.

'The feedback we receive from the London Road Local Action Team and other stakeholders will be used as a basis for developing options.'
