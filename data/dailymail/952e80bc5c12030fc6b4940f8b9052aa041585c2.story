A total of 1 in 10 patients cannot get a GP appointment, figures show.

There were 34 million occasions last year when patients were unable to book a slot when they needed to.

The Royal College of GPs claims this is up by three million compared to 2011/12 and blames a lack doctors, nurses and receptionists.

Some surgeries are now so busy that there are queues of patients down the street waiting for an appointment - at one they have even resorted to bringing along stools from home.

It is partly due to the rising population as well as increase in elderly who tend to take up more of GPs' time as they have a range of complex conditions.

But senior family doctors say they are not being given enough funding from the Government to hire extra staff to meet this demand.

Dr Maureen Baker, chair of the RCGP said: 'People do need to see a GP as soon as possible for right action to be taken and the right treatment to be delivered.

'And this is a worry we have: that the lack of access to GPs might be making some problems worse.'

Causes: The increase in waiting times has been blamed on the rise in population as well the elderly, who tend to take up more of a GP's time

'The unprecedented decline in funding 
for healthcare in the community has brought general practice to its 
knees. GPs can't keep doing more for less.'

The
 RCGP obtained the figures from the Department of Health's annual GP 
patient survey which is carried out by one million members of the 
public.

In December, the Care Quality Commission watchdog said that one GP surgery in Birmingham was so busy that patients brought along stools to wait in a queue outside.

And in June, Dr Clare Gerada, former head of the RCGP, said that there were queues down the street outside her own surgery in South London.

Dr Peter Swinyard, chair of the Family Doctor Association and a GP in Swindon, said: 'We can't give a gold-plated service to all of our patients on a share of the resources which is dropping so significantly," he said.

'We have had a 25 per cent cut in resources in general practice to look after patients who are sicker, who are more complex, and who are taking more of our time and attention. Something has got to give.'

But the Department of Health accused the College of 'conflating the figures' by trying to claim 34 million couldn't get an appointment.

A spokesman said: 'It's complete nonsense to suggest that 34 million people won't be able to get an doctor's appointment this year.

'Misleading extrapolations of partial data have been used to generate a sensationalist headline.

'The GP Survey showed the vast majority of patients are satisfied with their GP and rated their experience of making an appointment as good.'
