Edward Maher died during a selection exercise for the Territorial Army's SAS

The Ministry of Defence is being probed after two soldiers died during a SAS selection exercise in sweltering temperatures in the Brecon Beacons.

Two reservists, one who was today named as Edward Maher, and Lance Corporal Craig Roberts, died after they collapsed in soaring temperatures while scaling south Wales's highest mountain Pen Y Fan on July 13.

In the aftermath of the deaths, investigations have been launched by both the police and the Health and Safety Executive (HSE).

Today Powys Coroner Louise Hunt said she will also launch her own probe - which she said was covered by Article 2 of the Human Rights Act.

She told the court that, under this piece of legislation, the state had 'a duty to protect an individual’s life'.

Before adjourning proceedings, she said a full inquest would examine all the circumstances leading up to the deaths and examine any 'failings... if they are identified'.

Ms Hunt also said her investigation was not a 'normal' inquest; any future verdict given must be independent and have the full involvement of both victims' families.

'I would also like to place on record my deepest condolences to both families,' she added.Lieutenant Colonel Freddie Kemp represented the Ministry of Defence’s Defence Inquest Unit at today’s hearing.

He said the military’s casualty visiting unit had been working closely with all the families affected.

Proceedings were adjourned until September 3, when they will resume for a pre-inquest hearing at Aberdare Coroner’s Court.

Ms Hunt said: 'Hopefully the police and HSE will give me an update on their investigations.'

The Brecon Beacons is one of several locations used by the British military for training, and Lance Corporal Craig Roberts (pictured) was one of two reservists who died while on the training exercise

Brave Mr Maher had served in Iraq and
Afghanistan. Edward, known as Eddie to friends, served his country in 
Iraq and Afghanistan in an elite special reserve unit often behind enemy
lines.

His comrade Will Walker took to Facebook to say Edward was a respected a liked member of his unit.

He said: 'Eddie you will be missed by all, rest easy now and we will all see you at the re-org. Edward
served in 4/73 Special OP battery - an elite unit within 5 Regiment, 
Royal Artillery, tasked with directing artillery fire and air strikes 
deep into enemy territory.'

Naming
Mr Maher, whose identity had not been known until now, a Ministry of 
Defence spokesman said: 'Our thoughts are with his family and friends at
this difficult time.

'Investigations
are being carried out by Powys police and the army. We cannot comment 
any further until these investigations are complete.'

In
a brief statement released through the MoD, Mr Maher's family said: 'At
this time of great sadness, Edward’s family has asked that they be left
alone to grieve in private.'

Further tests will be carried out on the
two soldiers after 
examinations have failed to discover the cause of their deaths.

Pen y Fan is home to the gruelling 'Fan Dance', which involves would-be special forces personnel marching up the mountain, down the other side and back again carrying a weighted pack and rifle - then doing the route in reverse in a set time

Witnesses on the day said they saw two soldiers 'clearly in distress' who pleaded with them for some drinking water.

An inquest at Brecon Law Courts in Powys, mid Wales, gave the medical deaths of the pair as 'unascertained'.

Speaking at the brief hearing was Dyfed Powys Police Detective Inspector Ieuan Wyn Jones.

He said that L/Cpl Roberts had been pronounced dead on the mountain at 
5.15pm, while Mr Maher died at Prince Charles Hospital in Merthyr Tydfil
almost three hours later.

'Post mortems have been carried out and the causes of death are unascertained,' he added.

'Further investigations are being carried out.'

A third man who was also taken ill and airlifted to safety remains in hospital.

Sources have said that L/Cpl Roberts and his colleague died from heat exhaustion on July 13 as temperatures hit 29.5C (85.1F).

Witnesses
reported seeing a number of soldiers on the training exercise 'pleading
for water' for someone who seemed to 'be in distress'.

It is believed the group had been taking part in the aptitude training element of the course to become SAS reservists.

They had been tutored in how to survive in hostile territory and were embarking on the testing stage of the process.

The Brecon Beacons is one of several locations used by the British military for training.

Its rugged and sprawling terrain helps prepare soldiers physically and mentally for warfare, as well as putting their logistic skills to the test - making it an ideal area for elite forces personnel such as the SAS.

Pen y Fan, the highest mountain in southern Britain, is home to the gruelling 'Fan Dance', which involves would-be special forces personnel marching up the mountain, down the other side and back again carrying a weighted pack and rifle - then doing the route in reverse in a set time.

When news of the deaths broke, tributes poured in for former teaching assistant L/Cpl Roberts, of Penrhyn Bay, near Llandudno.

The 24-year-old had reportedly served with the TA for more than five years, including tours of Iraq and Afghanistan.

In a statement issued through the MoD, his father Kelvin Roberts said: “We are all devastated at the loss of our beloved Craig.

'This has left a massive hole in all our lives.

'We wholeheartedly supported Craig in his military endeavours and it gives us some comfort, though great sadness, that he died in the pursuit of his dream.

'Next month Craig was due to start a new post in the office of the Secretary of State for Education and we were all very proud of him.'
