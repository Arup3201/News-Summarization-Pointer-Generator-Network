He may be a veteran base jumper, but even daredevil Sebastian Alvarez admitted being nervous before his latest stunt - jumping off a bridge from the back of a moving truck.

Adrenaline junkie Alvarez has completed more than 400 dangerous BASE jumps, but had never tried one from the back of a moving vehicle.

The stunt had to be timed to perfection as Alvarez leaped over a camera mounted on the railing of  Amolanas Bridge in Coquimbo, Chile, missing the edge by inches.

Daredevil Sebastian Alvarez has jumped off the edge of a 328ft bridge from the back of a moving truck

Alvarez had to time the stunt to perfection, leaping over a camera and missing the railing by inches before quickly pulling his parachute chord

He then deployed his parachute before floating more than 300ft back down to earth.

He said: 'This jump was very technical, if I made a bad exit from the truck or had a bad parachute opening, things turn immediately dangerous.

'Also Amolanas is a low bridge where there are almost no room for mistakes. If I don't open the parachute right before I jump, I'd be dead on the ground four to five seconds after.'

'I was scared, but you have to turn it into something positive. Fear is good, panic means death," Alvarez said.

'But at the same time, I felt really confident, I love to jump from bridges. Everything goes very fast so theres no time to think, you can only react.'

Alvarez was driven into position by his friend of 15 years Matias, who he refers to by the nickname Gaviota - meaning 'seagull'.

While 300ft may seem a long way, for a parachute jump it is a very short distance, meaning Alvarez would have had little time to react had anything gone wrong

Despite having completed more than 400 jumps before, Alvarez admitted to being nervous before this one, having never jumped from the back of a moving vehicle before

He was also accompanied by Chilean surf filmmaker Johannes Bock, who filmed the outside scenes, and a Danish friend.

And the jump has done nothing to dull Alvarez's thirst for BASE jumping.

'This is my first jump from a moving vehicle and for sure its not gonna be the last,' he added.

'In the air I felt really good. As soon as i jumped I realised that my body was in a good position and when i saw my parachute opening perfectly, I was very excited.

'I landed in a small area beside the river. It was a very technical landing.'

Amolanas is Chile's second highest bridge, measuring 328ft off the ground, compared with 336ft for the Loa Viaduct.

Alvarez was only in free fall for a few moments before pulling his parachute chord and floating back to earth

Despite the obvious danger, Alvarez said he loved jumping from the truck, and vowed the stunt will not be his last from the back of a moving vehicle

The BASE in BASE jumping is an acronym which stands for building, antenna, span or Earth, and the sport's participants leap from any and all four of these things while performing their stunts.

Technically a base jump is any in which the jumper leaps from a fixed point or object, then uses a fast deploying parachute to float back down to Earth.

The first official BASE jumps were filmed in 1978 by Carl Boenish from El Capitan rock in Yosemite National Park, and since then the sport has attracted participants worldwide.

Since 1981 there have been 230 registered deaths from BASE jumping. Jumpers are roughly 43 times more likely to kill or injure themselves compared with jumping from a plane.
