An illustrated book from 1893 with one man's prediction of what fashions of the decades to come would look like has been unearthed.

The Future Dictates of Fashion by W. Cade Gall was published in the January 1893 edition of The Strand magazine and contains hilarious illustrations of the 'future of fashion'.

The article, which was found in a library, predicts one hundred years' worth of style. 

1900-1912: The Future Dictates of Fashion by W. Cade Gall was published in the January 1893 edition of The Strand magazine and contains illustrations of what he predicts will be the future of fashion

It begins in 1900 with a rather wizardly array of garments, including plenty of walking sticks, oversized hats and voluminous skirts.

The men of the 1920s sport billowing shorts and extravagant hats, while his vision for the 1930s focuses on oversized coats with ribbon embellishment.

1920s: Billowing culottes - tipped to be a big trend this season - were the order of the day in his vision of the 20s

The 1930s (left) were a lot more stylish than Gall predicted - but he was right in thinking hats would play a big part in the 1920s (right)

1930s: All attention is on headwear in the 1930s and it seems that the bigger, the better

1940s: Things are looking more stylish by the 40s...could those be leather trousers?

The 1940s, as imagined by Gall, focus on intricate headwear and what look like leather trousers for men - which actually took the fashion scene by storm last season.

The 1950s and 1960s show an appreciation of layering and the 'skirt over trousers' look that was prominent in the 90s makes an appearance.

Fashion of the 1970s and 1980s is a much more regal affair, with a big emphasis on tailoring. The styles of 1993 show a lady clad in an outfit consisting of a Breton striped T-shirt - a stylish wardrobe staple for decades now - and flowing ankle-length skirt.

1950s: The 1950s and 1960s show an appreciation of layering and the 'skirt over trousers' look and hats are still hot on the style agenda

1950s: The Fifties prediction was spot-on in terms of ruffled layers but there were no skirts over trousers in evidence, at least not in the case of actress Linda Christian in 1950 (right)

The Public Domain Review, which published the illustrations, says: 'If indeed this was a genuine attempt by the author Gall to imagine what the future of fashion might look like, it’s fascinating to see how far off the mark he was, proving yet again how difficult it is to predict future aesthetics.

'It is also fascinating to see how Gall envisaged the progression of fashions across the decades - considering that, from our perspective now, his vision of 1970 doesn’t much look much different to 1920 - and to see which aspects of his present he wasn’t even able to consider losing to the march of time (e.g. the long length of women’s skirts and the seemingly ubiquitous frill).

'As is often the case when we come into contact with historic attempts to predict a future which for us is now past, it is like glimpsing into another possible world, a parallel universe that could have been.'

1970s: While there isn't a stark contrast between the fashion of the 20s and 70s, tailoring is more prominent in the latter decade

1970s: While he may have got the flared trousers spot on, Gall didn't predict the flower power fashion of the 70s (right)

Eighties fashion could be outrageous, but wasn't quite as out there as Gall predicted (left), Princess Diana shows us the glitzy side of real 1980s style (right)

1993: A lady clad in an unflattering outfit consisting of a Breton T-shirt and flowing ankle-length skirt was the forecast for 1993 - and it isn't too dissimilar from Gianfranco Ferre SS 1993 fashion collection in Milan (right)
