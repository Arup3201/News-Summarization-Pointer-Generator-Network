A suicide bomber has killed three Afghan citizens in an attack at a US military base near the eastern city of Khost.

The Taliban has claimed responsibility for the attack at Camp Chapman in which police have said a local guard and two civilians were killed along with the bomber.

The Taliban say they sent a suicide bomber driving a van packed with explosives to the base. The driver was stopped however at the gate by the guard who was killed in the attack, police general Abdul Qayum Baqizai has said.

The camp, which is next to the Khost airport, near the border to Pakistan, is believed to be used by the CIA and was attacked by a suicide bomber three years ago when seven CIA employees were killed.

Taliban spokesman Zabihullah Mujahid has claimed the bomber was targeting Afghan police manning the gate along with Afghans working for the Americans entering the base.

General Baqizoy said no CIA agents had been hurt in today's attack.

The al Qaeda-linked Haqqani network, regarded as the most dangerous enemy to the US in Afghanistan, is known to be active in the Khost province.

Three years ago, a Jordanian double-agent linked at al Qaeda killed seven CIA employees and a Jordanian intelligence officer in a suicide bombing at the same base, which was the second deadliest attack in CIA history.

Meanwhile, the Interior Ministry has said a policewomen who killed an American contractor in Kabul on Monday was an Iranian in Afghanistan who had displayed 'unstable behaviour' but had no known links to militants.

The policewoman, named as Sgt. Nargas, shot 49-year-old Joseph Griffin, of Mansfield, Georgia, on Monday, in what is believed to be the first shooting by a woman in a spate of insider attacks.

Nargas walked into a heavily-guarded compound in the heart of Kabul, confronted Griffin and shot him once with her pistol.

US-based security firm DynCorp International has said on its website that Griffin was a US military veteran who had previously worked with the country's law enforcement agencies.

He was under contract in Kabul to the NATO military command to advise the Afghan police force.

The ministry spokesman Sediq Sediqi has said Nargas moved to the country ten years ago, after her husband obtained fake documents enabling her to live and work there.

The mother of four, who is in her early 30s, joined the police five years ago and had a clean record, he said.

Under interrogation she said her plan had been to kill either the Kabul governor or  police chief but when she realised that security was too tight, she saw ‘a foreigner’ and turned her weapon on him instead.
