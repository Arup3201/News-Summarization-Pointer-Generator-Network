A property tycoon at the centre of one of Britain’s biggest divorce cases yesterday claimed his estranged wife hired eight private detectives to track his movements.

Scot Young, who was once estimated to be worth more than £400million, accused wife Michelle of installing ‘covert surveillance’ and breaching his privacy.

He told the High Court in London that since 2009 up to eight investigators watched him throughout the day on ‘shifts’ and this had ‘perpetuated’ his health problems.

Jailed: Scot Young has been held in contempt of court for failing to reveal details of his finances

Mr Young, who made a fortune as a fixer 
for British businessmen and Russian oligarchs, has been accused by 
Michelle Young, 48, of hiding ‘enormous assets’ to get out of paying the
 £30,000 a month she had been awarded.

The pair have been embroiled in a bitter
 divorce battle since 2006. Mr Young, 51, told the court: ‘There’s been a
 long history (of covert surveillance) since 2009 until today.

‘I believe covert surveillance continues on me and it is highly illegal. This is perpetuating my health problems.’

At a previous High Court hearing, Mr Young was ordered to make a full 
financial disclosure or serve the  six-month suspended sentence he was 
originally handed back in 2009 for contempt.

Mr Young, who represented himself in court yesterday, said the reason he
 failed to produce documents detailing his assets was because of ill 
health and that he feared people calling him on his mobile phone may 
have been private detectives hired by his estranged wife.

He said: ‘When you have up to eight individuals on three shifts it is 
very difficult to know who is process server and who is a detective 
hired by my wife.’

Presenting a medical report, Mr Young revealed he had been sectioned 
under the Mental Health Act on December 11, 2012. He said his failure to
 comply with court orders to pay his wife was because of this.

Mr Young, who claims he is penniless after a large Moscow real estate 
deal collapsed, said: ‘In the condition I am in, paranoia can manifest 
in many ways, especially when you have eight people following you.

‘I spent 14 days in hospital under the Mental Health Act.

'This was at an
 NHS hospital, not a private one. It was not a nice experience.’

But Edward Fitzgerald QC, for Mrs Young, said he was ‘sceptical’ about the ‘excuse’.

He said: ‘There is a very deja vu element to it, with reference to a similar medical excuse (presented by Mr Young previously).

‘It is a coincidence that at the threat of a committal the same medical 
excuse is presented in the same terms, by the same hospital.

‘I deal with this with a great deal of scepticism.’

Mrs Young was previously awarded £30,000 a month to pay for rent and school fees for their two children.

The court was told that she is owed £1million in unpaid maintenance.

Mr 
Fitzgerald said: ‘He has never paid a penny. He’s been in breach of that
 order for three and a half years.’

The case continues.
