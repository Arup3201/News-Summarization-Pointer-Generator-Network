No clear leader has been announced in the primary contest between pop star turned political candidate Clay Aiken and textile entrepreneur Keith Crisco in the Democratic congressional race in North Carolina.

Aiken, once a runner-up on TV's American Idol, and Crisco each had about 40 per cent of the vote late Tuesday night in the 2nd Congressional District.

They were trailed by licensed family counselor Toni Morris of Fayetteville.

The winner will challenge incumbent Republican Congresswoman Renee Ellmers in November in the heavily Republican district.

She had a better go of her own party's primary, as Ellmers handily defeated her primary challenger on Tuesday.

The Democratic race has drawn celebrity buzz thanks to Aiken's career as an entertainer- even though this is his first political campaign.

The openly gay father-turned-politician launched his campaign in February by releasing an emotionally-charged video where he detailed his mother's domestic abuse and his criticisms of the Congresswoman Ellmers.

The entertainer talked about his work as a special education teacher, UNICEF representative and member of President Bush's commission on education.

'For most Americans, there are no golden tickets- at least not like the kind you see on TV,' he says to the camera.

'More families are struggling today than at any time in our history, and here in North Carolina, we've suffered more than our share of pain.'

Aiken said he examined the district's makeup for more than a year and has assembled a veteran Democratic political team.

Aiken announced in 2008 that he is gay and has a 5-year-old son who was conceived through in-vitro fertilization with an older female friend.

He said in an interview with the Associated Press that he doesn't believe his sexual orientation will play a role in whether or not people vote for him.

'There are dozens of issues that are important to the people living in the district, and that is not one of them,' he said.

In the launch video, he cited Ellmer's votes in favor of military spending cuts and the federal shutdown as being harmful for the country, as well as North Carolina's 2nd District.

'I'm not a politician. I don't ever want to be one. But I do want to help bring back- at least to my corner of North Carolina- the idea that someone can go to Washington to represent all the people, whether they voted for you or not,' he said in the video.

For Aiken, a Democrat, winning in the Republican-leaning District will be a challenge: Mitt Romney won 58 per cent of the vote in the district in 2012, according to a North Carolina Chamber analysis.

John Davis, a longtime political researcher in North Carolina, said Aiken stands a decent chance to win the primary, but the district boundaries drawn by Republicans will make it difficult for any Democrat to win in November- particularly given his sexuality.

'It's not going to be an issue that people are going to talk openly about,' Davis said.

His opponent dismissed his candidacy today by taking a swipe at his singing career.

'Apparently his performing career isn’t going so well and he’s bored,' Mrs Ellmers told a radio station Wednesday.
