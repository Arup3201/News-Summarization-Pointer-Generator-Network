As if sky diving wasn't enough of a rush two daredevils have filmed themselves scuba skydiving, where both are kitted up with wetsuits and snorkels ready for then they reach the sea.

In a move worthy of James Bond, the scuba gear lies on the seabed ready to collect after impacting the water and disengaging from the parachute.

An extraordinary video documents the white knuckle jump in Australia that sees them land in the Great Barrier Reef.

The video begins in Port Douglas at 8.47am on a Sunday morning as a few people get the small helicopter ready for the trip.

'It's going to be a beautiful day and I think we are going to get into a chopper, go flying out over the barrier reef and right into it,' says one 'I can't wait.'

Both are wearing  GoPro cameras to document the extreme excursion.

After picking the perfect spot one climbs down the helicopter and then they both make the leap together, filming one another.

They free fall towards a small atoll before releasing the parachutes ready for the water to break their fall.

Gulliver Page, one of the flying frogmen, is filmed diving down to collect his scuba gear which is in the shallows and putting it on underwater. 

He then scuba dives around the reef happily blowing bubble rings for the camera. 

Page warned that the experience might not be everyone's cup of tea.

'Jumping out of a helicopter in snorkelling gear and landing on the Great Barrier Reef isn't for everyone, but it's certainly a novel way to experience this beautiful part of the world,' he said.

The video is featured on Tropical North Queensland's official You Tube channel entitled '1 Day in Paradise'.

The group explains: ' There's only one thing that's better than scuba diving on the Great Barrier Reef, and that's skydiving from a helicopter, releasing your parachute just above the water, swimming down to the bottom to get your tank and then scuba diving on the Great Barrier Reef.'

The film making team included Gulliver Page, Pete Mether and Matt Hodges.
