President Barack Obama on Thursday defended America's controversial drone attacks as legal, effective and a necessary linchpin in an evolving U.S. counterterrorism policy, saying, 'Simply put, these strikes save lives.' But he acknowledged the targeted strikes are no 'cure-all' and said he is haunted by the civilians unintentionally killed.

The president also announced a renewed push to close the Guantanamo Bay detention center in Cuba, including lifting a moratorium on prisoner transfers to Yemen. However, shutting the prison will still require help from Republicans reluctant to back Obama's call to move some detainees to U.S. prisons and try them in civilian courts.

Obama framed his address as an attempt to redefine the nature and scope of terror threats facing the U.S., noting the weakening of al-Qaida and the impending end of the U.S. war in Afghanistan.

Reframing: Obama framed his address as an attempt to redefine the nature and scope of terror threats facing the U.S., noting the weakening of al-Qaida and the impending end of the U.S. war in Afghanistan

'Neither I, nor any president, can 
promise the total defeat of terror,' Obama said in remarks at the 
National Defense University. 'What we can do — what we must do — is 
dismantle networks that pose a direct danger, and make it less likely 
for new groups to gain a foothold, all while maintaining the freedoms 
and ideals that we defend.'

Since taking office, Obama's 
counterterrorism strategy has increasingly relied on the use of strikes 
by unmanned spy drones, particularly in Pakistan and Yemen. The highly 
secretive program has faced criticism from congressional lawmakers who 
have questioned its scope and legality.

The president, in his most expansive 
public discussion on drones, defended their targeted killings as both 
effective and legal. He acknowledged the civilian deaths that sometimes 
result — a consequence that has angered many of the countries where the 
U.S. seeks to combat extremism — and said he grapples with that 
trade-off.

'For me, and those in my chain of 
command, these deaths will haunt us as long as we live,' he said. Before
any strike, he said, 'there must be near-certainty that no civilians 
will be killed or injured — the highest standard we can set.'

Ahead of the address, Obama signed new 'presidential policy guidelines' aimed at illustrating more clearly to Congress and the public the standards the U.S. applies before carrying out drone attacks

The CIA is still expected to maintain control of the drone program in Yemen, as well as in Pakistan's tribal areas

Ahead of the address, Obama signed 
new 'presidential policy guidelines' aimed at illustrating more clearly 
to Congress and the public the standards the U.S. applies before 
carrying out drone attacks.

Officials said the guidelines include not 
using strikes when the targeted people can be captured, either by the 
U.S. or a foreign government, relying on drones only when the target 
poses an 'imminent' threat and establishing a preference for giving the 
military control of the drone program.

However, the CIA is still expected to
maintain control of the drone program in Yemen, as well as in 
Pakistan's tribal areas, given the concern that al-Qaida may return in 
greater numbers as U.S. troops draw down in Afghanistan. The military 
and the CIA currently work side by side in Yemen, with the CIA flying 
its drones over the northern region out of a covert base in Saudi 
Arabia, and the military flying its unmanned aerial vehicles from 
Djibouti.

In Pakistan alone, up to 3,336 people
have been killed by the unmanned aircraft since 2003, according to the 
New America Foundation which maintains a database of the strikes.

Obama's advisers said the new 
guidelines will effectively limit the number of drone strikes in terror 
zones and pointed to a future decline of attacks against extremists in 
Afghanistan as the war there winds down next year. But strikes elsewhere
will continue. The guidelines will also apply to strikes against both 
foreigners and U.S. citizens abroad.

On the eve of the president's speech,
the administration revealed for the first time that a fourth American 
citizen had been killed in secretive drone strikes abroad. The killings 
of three other Americans in counterterror operations since 2009 were 
widely known before a letter from Attorney General Eric Holder to Senate
Judiciary Committee Chairman Patrick Leahy acknowledged the four 
deaths.

In that letter, Holder said only one 
of the U.S. citizens killed in counterterror operations beyond war zones
— Anwar al-Awlaki, who had ties to at least three attacks planned or 
carried out on U.S. soil — was specifically targeted by American forces.
He said the other three Americans were not targeted in the U.S. 
strikes.
