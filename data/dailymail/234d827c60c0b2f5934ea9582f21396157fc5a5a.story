Carlo Ancelotti has a 500million euro problem: his gold-plated diamond-studded super squad is heavy on attacking forward flair and light on midfield runners. 

As one of his many predecessors, Carlos Queiroz complained in 2003: 'I have a lot of concert pianists but no one to move the piano.'

Gareth Bale could be his answer. The Real Madrid coach will have had two weeks to think about how best to give his team back its balance by the time Real Madrid play the local derby with Champions Atletico this weekend and the Italian coach is considering using Bale in a slightly more withdrawn role to compensate for the loss of Angel di Maria.

Stamina: Carlo Ancelotti believes Bale has the engine required to be the driving force in the Madrid side

(4-3-3): Casillas, Carvajal, Pepe, Ramos, Marcelo, Modric, Kroos, Bale, James, Benzema, Ronaldo.

Ancelotti wants to retain Real Madrid’s 4-3-3 shape – the formation that helped them win the Champions League last season – but whereas last season Di Maria had the engine to play on the left of the three and protect the left back, James Rodriguez already looks as though he is struggling in the role.

Bale’s phenomenal stamina has been displayed many times in his career from his days as a marauding left-back, to the taxi for Maicon nights, to the lung-busting goal scored with a run from the half-way line in the last minutes of the Kings Cup final, so Ancelotti is weighing up the possibility of playing Bale on the left of a midfield three with Toni Kroos and Luka Modric.

The plus side for Bale will be that he ends up back on his favoured left side and Ancelotti believes Bale like Di Maria will not only be capable of doing a job defensively but also be capable of running down the left filling the space vacated by Cristiano Ronaldo as he moves from his starting position on the left of the front three to a more central position.

Attacking flair: Bale needs to drop deeper to accommodate James Rodriguez and Cristiano Ronaldo

Bale may well feel moving further from goal is scant reward for his netting 20 times last season but such is life at Madrid that everyone has to be accommodating when a new star arrives. Zinedine Zidane was also shoehorned into a wide-left starting position in the Galaticos team that David Beckham joined in 2003. 

The Frenchman spent most of the game coming inside to influence the match as left back Roberto Carlos overlapped him. Beckham ended up playing in a holding midfield position in that team because Luis Figo’s name was already written in stone on the right wing.

A long term solution to Ancelotti’s problems could be the incorporation of Sami Khedira on the left of the midfield with Bale returning to the top three – last season dubbed the BBC. But a forward line of Bale, Benzema and Cristiano leaves no place for Rodriguez and so that would not completely solve Ancelotti’s dilemma. He needs the right balance to win football matches, but he also needs to keep his president happy after another summer of big signings.
