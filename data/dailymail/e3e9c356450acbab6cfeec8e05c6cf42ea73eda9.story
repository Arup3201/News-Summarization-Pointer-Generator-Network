Matt Barlow Reports From Basle

Nostalgia had been in overdrive long before Roy Hodgson stepped off the plane on Sunday, as the nation famed for its clock-making turned them back to an era when the England boss sparked a revolution in Swiss football.

‘We are still benefiting today from the structures he put in place at the time,’ said their new manager Vladimir Petkovic, as he joined the reflection on Hodgson’s influence, nearly 20 years on.

Petkovic was playing in Switzerland at the time, nearing the end of his career and starting to take an interest in coaching.

Hodgson proved to be a modernising force. It was his work with the Swiss - leading the national team to their first World Cup finals in 28 years - that made Inter Milan come calling.

Last week, popular tabloid newspaper Blick ran a series entitled: ‘Roy was for me…’ which featured memories from the stars of his USA ’94 squad.

‘Roy welded us together,’ said Ciriaco Sforza, who won 79 caps for Switzerland and would follow Hodgson to Inter. ‘We would train and train again. By the time we were finished, we could do it blind. We had success that made us strong against any opponent.

‘Before the World Cup we were all hungry players and after the World Cup, most of us were sold abroad. There we pushed the doors open for the next generations.’

Having been appointed in January 1992, at the age of 44, Hodgson devoted time to drilling the team into his style. Clubs agreed to release players for four mini training camps each year. They would gather in different parts of the country for three days of intensive tactical work.

Most Swiss clubs were playing with a sweeper at the time and he was keen to reshape them into a 4-4-2 formation. It must have worked. At one point in ‘93, they were ranked third in the world by FIFA. After the World Cup in ’94, they qualified for Euro ‘96, although Hodgson left for Inter in November ‘95.

‘He was a leader in terms of tactics,’ said striker Adrian Knup. ‘He founded the 4-4-2 system. We soon realised this system could lead to success, and that gave us confidence. The whole of Swiss football has become stronger thanks to him.’

Hodgson’s success attracted sponsorship, including finance giants Credit Suisse, who funded four new academies and supported the Switzerland youth teams. ‘Thanks to Roy, money could be generated,’ said Stephane Chapuisat, the star of Hodgson’s team. ‘We are still reaping the fruits of his work.’

At the turn of the century, the Swiss FA also sank time and money into their youth system and developed links to ethnic communities in their cities after a time when the country was receiving many immigrants fleeing from the former Yugoslavia.

The population is just over eight million but here was an influx of talent from a part of the world where football ruled. Many of them had a healthy desire to make a better life, which collided with a fast-improving football infrastructure in Switzerland.

It has helped produce team successes such as the U17 world title in 2009 and high-quality individuals like Xherdan Shaqiri, who left Kosovo for Switzerland at the age of one, and Granit Xhaka, who was born in Basle to parents from Kosovo.

It is a multicultural generation which forms the basis of the team managed by Petkovic, a Bosnian-Croat who emigrated from Sarajevo for Switzerland in 1987 and replaced Ottmar Hitzfeld after the World Cup in Brazil. He will put his own influence on Swiss football, and there are suggestions he will flex Hitzfeld’s favoured 4-2-3-1 formation into a 4-3-3 shape for his first game in charge.

The nostalgia does not extend to a return to 4-4-2 (not for Switzerland, anyhow) but they will be forever grateful to Hodgson, their catalyst for change.
