An unscrupulous couple who operated a £250,000 VAT scam claimed £32,000 a year in benefits to fund their luxury Chelsea penthouse.

Emmanuel and Behnaz Scotts received £2,670 a month in housing benefit, covering 60 per cent of their bill for the four-bed apartment in the exclusive Chelsea Harbour.

They were also given £1,750 a year in child benefit, which helped to fund a private school education for one of their two daughters.

Life of luxury: Behnaz and Emmanuel Scotts received £2,670 a month in housing benefit, which helped to pay for their four-bed apartment in the exclusive Chelsea Harbour

The couple received jobseekers' allowance of £64.30 a week each - which Hammersmith 
and Fulham Council said meant it was forced to pay them housing benefit.

They were able to live in the same blocks as singer Robbie Williams and sir Michael Caine.

Meanwhile Scotts, 44, was conning staff at high-end stores into thinking he was a rich tourist so he could claim tax back on refunded goods.

He bought Chanel handbags and jewellery VAT-free and would then get a refund from a different branch on the VAT-inclusive amount.

He was jailed for four-and-a-half years while his 42-year-old wife was spared a prison sentence after admitting to transferring profits of £74,000 into her bank account.

Emmanuel Scotts, a professional fraudster with
 convictions for similar rackets in the UK, Switzerland and 
Sweden, also stole £38,000 from a pawnbroker.

The Chanel fraud took place from January to June 2009, while he was waiting to be sentenced for an identical fraud at retailers John Lewis and Peter Jones, the Old Bailey was told.

Sarah Giddens, prosecuting, said the couple got to know staff at the central London stores in order to get them to sign forms allowing the fraud to take place.

She added: 'The UK retail export scheme is a scheme that allows a traveller to the UK who is not a resident of the UK or EU to purchase goods from participating retailers, inclusive to VAT, to claim back that VAT when they leave the EU.

'This is done using a reclaim form, called the VAT 407.

'This case is all about an abuse of the export system, at Chanel, a luxury boutique shop, selling high level items, often to wealthy visitors to the UK.

'In total they attempted to make a quarter of a million pounds in VAT refunds, but were actually paid £176,000.

Ideal home: The couple lived in the tasteful flat with their two daughters while scamming the taxpayer by claiming VAT back on Chanel handbags and jewellery

'The Scotts used a system whereby they would make a purchase from one Chanel shop, and have it refunded at another.

'Emmanuel Scotts would often visit the shops, appeared friendly, well presented and would get to know they staff very well, who though he was a rich foreign customer.

'He would then present them with a VAT 407 in respect of false invoices, which they would sign.'

Ms Giddens said police found rubber stamps at their home, and information on Scotts' laptop which detailed the designs of customs stamps, which he used on the forms.

A few weeks later the cash would be transferred into the couple's bank account.

In total, Emmanuel Scotts made 33 claims VAT refunds for high end luxury handbags and jewellery worth £250,000 in bank accounts belonging to the couple's false identities.

'Both had changed their name by deed poll, using different email addresses and had different accounts in those names.

Unethical: Scotts, a professional fraudster with convictions for similar scams in the UK as well as Switzerland and Sweden, also stole £38,000 from a pawn broker

'In total 75 bank accounts were in their identities, a large number being used in the course of the fraud.'

Ms Giddens added that Scotts admitted stealing £37,878 from London pawnbrokers TM Sutton after a cheque bounced when he collected possessions he had left with the shop.

In mitigation, Felicia Davy said that while he had a bad record, the cause of his behaviour was a gambling addiction.

'During the time of the offending, he has had a substantial gambling addiction, which he had described as being worse than being on drugs.'

Sentencing Emmanuel Scotts to four years for the fraud and six months consecutive for the theft, Judge Richard McGregor-Johnson said: 'This was in my judgement a pre-planned professional exercise.

Cheating the system: The Scotts received more than £40,000 a year in benefits while enjoying an opulent lifestyle

'You established a rapport with members of staff at the stores in order to get them to sign them off.

'You then managed to fraudulently stamp these forms, in order to make a quarter of a million pounds from the tax payer.

'You also committed this at a time when you were awaiting to be sentenced for an identical matter.'This offence therefore requires a substantial time in custody.'

Judge McGregor-Johnson sentenced his wife to 51 weeks, suspended for two years.

'You used your bank account to transfer £74,000 of criminal property, and you have a previous conviction for fraud.

Extravagant behaviour: The Scotts sent one of their two daughters to private school while Emmanuel indulged a gambling habit

'However as for you closing you eyes to this matter, you knew your husband's previous convictions and you knew about his background.'

Scotts pleaded guilty to cheating the public revenue and theft, and pleaded guilty along with his wife to transferring the proceeds of crime into bank accounts.

Martin Brown, Assistant Director for Criminal Investigation at HMRC, said: 'The Scotts thought this fraud was too clever to fail. They passed themselves off as high rollers and spent large sums of criminal cash in expensive boutiques and at casinos.

'They had no idea that HMRC officers were one step ahead and ready to arrest them. Fraudsters should take this as a warning – we will find you and you will have your day in court.'
