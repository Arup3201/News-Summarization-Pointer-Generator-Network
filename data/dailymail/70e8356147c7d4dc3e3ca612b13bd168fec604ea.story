Reese Witherspoon was arrested for disorderly conduct after allegedly resisting the orders of a police officer in Atlanta, Georgia, early on Friday morning.

The actress was jailed along with husband James Toth after he failed to pass a sobriety test.

The city’s Department of Corrections confirmed that the couple were arrested after Toth was stopped by a patrol car under suspicion of driving under the influence of alcohol.

Reese, who is currently brunette, is pictured looking down with what appears to be a slight smirk across her face.

Meanwhile, her beau looks up to the camera in his picture, appearing somewhat glassy-eyed.

Their initial legal hearing for their arrests is set for Monday morning in the Atlanta Municipal court.

It was initially thought Reese and Jim would be in court on Monday morning in Atlanta.

However TMZ reports the couple's cases have been postponed, with Reese's set for May 22 and Jim's for May 23.

Toth was apprehended after midnight on Friday for recklessly weaving across Peachtree Street in the city of Atlanta.

The police report alleges that the Hollywood agent smelled of alcohol and appeared 'disheveled'.

After pulling the DUI suspect over, a sobriety test was conducted in a Walgreens parking lot.

Reese is said to have been warned to remain inside her vehicle, while her husband was subjected to the DUI test.

The officer on the scene claims that the actress became clearly agitated and eventually disobeyed his verbal commands.

The officer reported: ‘Mrs. 
Witherspoon began to hang out the window and say that she did not 
believe that I was a real police officer.’

The law enforcer explained in the report: ‘I told Mrs. Witherspoon to sit on her butt and be quiet.’

But
 once Toth was handcuffed, the mother-of-three disembarked from her 
seat, telling the officer that she was a ‘US citizen’ and that she had 
the right to ‘stand on American ground’.

The report then described how Reese resisted him as he grabbed her arms to arrest her.

Toth is said to have made a verbal attempt to calm his hysterical wife.

The
 officer’s report further details: ‘Mrs. Witherspoon asked, “Do you know
 my name?” I answered, “No, I don’t need to know your name.” I then 
added, “right now.” Mrs. Witherspoon stated, “You’re about to find out 
who I am.”’

According to the arresting officer: 
‘Mrs. Witherspoon also stated, “You are going to be on national news.” I
 advised Mrs. Witherspoon that was fine.’

Toth is said to be facing charges for driving under the influence and failure to stay within his lane while on the road.

While Reese’s alleged violation is ‘disorderly conduct (obstruction)', which falls under municipal ordinance.
