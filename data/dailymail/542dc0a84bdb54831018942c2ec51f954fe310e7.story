Astronauts go to the ends of the Earth to prepare for the isolation and dangers of space.

And for one group of Esa astronauts, that means spending days navigating dark, damp caves in Italy.

Esa trainers and caving specialists recently went underground in Sardinia to set the scene for space-like astronaut training later this summer, and claim clambering down to a cave is similar to a spacewalk.

Caves - short for Cooperative Adventure for Valuing and Exercising human behaviour and performance Skills - offers astronauts, trainers and planners a chance to test space-like procedures while exploring uncharted caverns in new environments

‘Caves’ - short for Cooperative Adventure for Valuing and Exercising human behaviour and performance Skills - helps astronauts test space-like procedures while exploring uncharted caverns.

For instance, clambering down to basecamp hundreds of metres below the surface using safety tethers is similar to conducting a spacewalk.

In space, an object can quickly float away and be lost forever. Likewise, in caving, dropped equipment can be lost forever in crevices or holes.

When passing equipment, both cavers and astronauts must make sure the recipient has grasped the item before the first person lets go.

'Caves is an exploration mission,' explained Caves exploration instructor Francesco Sauro, 'and this year will be more difficult as the astronauts venture further from basecamp'

'Caves is an exploration mission,' explained Caves exploration instructor Francesco Sauro, 'and this year will be more difficult as the astronauts venture further from basecamp.'

For the first time the trainees will set up an outpost more than 3.1 miles (5 km) from basecamp to spend the night, following directions and maps drawn by ‘cavenauts’ from previous years.

'It will be interesting to see how they manage the further exploration,' said Mr Francesco.

'As they distance themselves from basecamp it will get more challenging and I am curious to see how far they can go.'

As for any space mission, science is a priority so the astronauts will be measuring carbon dioxide and radon levels as well as taking microbiological samples of the life they encounter.

New techniques will be put to the test using apps developed by the trainers at the European Astronaut Centre that could be used on the International Space Station in the near future.

The cavenauts will be testing exciting new technology for cavers as well.

A system combining 3D cameras, laser mapping and a wearable computer offers the potential to map uncharted areas in real time and build a detailed 3D map for later use.

'What we are doing will be very interesting and useful for cavers all over the world,' added Mr Francesco.

If six months in orbit 230 miles from earth sounds like a challenge, take a look at the bizarre lengths astronaut Tim Peake has already gone to in his training.

 The countdown to blast-off has included a week in an underground cave and 12 days on the bottom of the sea.

Major Peake, Britain’s first astronaut for 20 years, took stomach-churning ‘zero gravity’ flights and learned Russian to communicate on the International Space Station.

And if that wasn’t enough, he yesterday said last year he may take didgeridoo lessons.

The former test pilot from Chichester, West Sussex, has no fears about launching into space from Kazakhstan in a Russian Soyuz rocket in November 2015 – because it’s much less dangerous than his old job

He said: ‘I think my future career is probably far safer than my past career. I’ve carried out some fairly high-risk flight tests. I’m not overly apprehensive.’

But the 41-year-old said the thrill was mixed with ‘concern’ over leaving his wife, Rebecca, and their two sons for so long.

Like in space, trainees have to be careful not to drop equipment

They will then spend the night in the cave, following directions left by previous ‘cavenauts’
