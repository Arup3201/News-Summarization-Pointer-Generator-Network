Fraudster: Peter Stead, 50, who has been jailed for two years posing as comedian Peter Kay's brother in several scams

A man who posed as the brother of comedian Peter Kay in order to defraud pub landlords has been jailed for two years.

Peter Stead used his made-up family connection to the famous funnyman to set up comedy nights for charity.

The 50-year-old fraudster took deposits from pub landlords to hold fundraising events in aid of a young child suffering from cancer.

On one occasion Mr Stead, posing as ‘Danny Kay’ told a landlord he was raising money for the Lewis Mighty Fund, a charity set up via a local hospital in aid of a young boy with Neuroblastoma, and that his brother would be making an appearance, Derby Crown Court heard.

In August 2009 Mr Stead, of no fixes address, visited a pub in Friargate, Derby, and after purporting to be Danny Kay promised that he would put on some comedy shows.

Ms Ahya said: ‘He said he would do a couple of comedy shows at the complainant’s public house.

‘These shows would be done to raise funds for the Lewis Mighty Fund.

‘That particular charity was to raise money for a young boy who was very unwell in Derby.

‘The complainant gave the defendant a £75 deposit to in due course undertake the shows.’

Mr Stead, who has a long list of previous convictions for dishonesty offences, failed to put on any shows.

On another occasion, he said Peter Kay would be turning up at his charitable function, after which a good-hearted publican offered him the venue for free and gave him £45 so that he could process his application for a charity licence, the court heard.

Jailing him for a total of two years Recorder Adrienne Lucking said Stead’s offences that played on people’s kindness where they thought they were helping the Lewis Mighty charitable cause were of a particularly mean nature.

‘You invoked the name of a charity which would inevitably and rightly tug on people’s heart strings because it was about a young man, a child, who was unfortunately someone who had a dreadful disease,’ she told him.

Fake claims: Mr Stead promised his 'brother' Peter Kay would be turning up at a made-up charity function - using the name of a charity in aid of a cancer-stricken child - to scam a pub landlord out of money

‘You played on people’s sympathy and their empathy and their wish to help others and they gave you their money.

‘They thought they were helping a fund or providing charitable support to a young man who needed it.

‘It’s difficult to think of a meaner kind of confidence fraud.’

Broken trust: Mr Stead was blasted for his 'confidence fraud' by posing as Peter Kay's brother

She added that he carried out his offending with ‘great enthusiasm’ over the years and was an experienced and practised confidence fraudster.

On other occasions Stead posed as the comedian’s brother and promised he could get a man a television for £50.

On another he said he could get tickets for a Peter Kay show but needed a £10 charitable donation.

In total he is thought to have made £540 from a series of frauds.

In mitigation Dean Bower said a lot of Stead’s offending stemmed from heavy drinking and he had that morning asked his lawyer to pass on an apology.

Mr Bower told the court: ‘He said: "To anybody I’ve upset I apologise. I want to say that no matter what I say I can’t undo what I’ve done."'

Mr Bower said Stead was particularly regretful about using the name of the Lewis Mighty Fund.

The Lewis Mighty Fund aids children being treated for cancer at Nottingham University Hospitals and to help them and their families in the community.

It is named after Lewis Paul who was diagnosed with Stage 4 High Risk Neuroblastoma aged four and passed away before his eight birthday.

‘In particular the defendant offers his apology to the parents of that boy, the wider family and friends who would have been undoubtedly upset and grossly offended when they found out what he had done.’

Mr Stead admitted five counts of fraud between 2008 and 2012.
