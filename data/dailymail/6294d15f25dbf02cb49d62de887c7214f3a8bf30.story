If you're looking for the ultimate Easter egg-stravaganza, London's Studio Kitchen at K West Hotel have obliged, with a sweet treat inspired by one of our most popular chocolates.

But if the thought of a Crème Egg Burger has your tastebuds recoiling at the horror of a meat patty slathered in crème egg filling, relax - this burger is made entirely from confectionery.

And this Frankenstein food - created specially for Easter by chefs in the Studio Kitchen burger lab, K West Hotel & Spa in Shepherds Bush, West London - will be available throughout spring.

The Crème Egg Burger is more sweet treat than meat feast, with chocolate covered brioche buns, a melted chocolate Crème Egg 'patty', plus strawberry jam filling and lashings of mascarpone cream

Sure to send sugar levels soaring, the mini slider burgers see a gooey melted crème egg playing the part of the patty, slathered in 'ketchup' made from strawberry jelly and sitting on a bed of thickly spread mascarpone cream.

Then of course, there are the buns. 

Slices of sweet brioche, the top layer is dunked in melted white chocolate for a thorough coating, before being sprinkled with colourful hundreds and thousands.

More sweet treat that meaty feast, the burgers have gone straight to the top of the Studio Kitchen dessert menu, priced at £5.50 for a portion of two.

Served from the end of March 2015 and throughout spring in celebration of Easter, the burgers also appear in the hotel's decadent Spring Rocks Afternoon Tea.

The Easter creation follows public outrage over the change in chocolate recipe for classic Cadbury's Crème Eggs. 

Changes to the classic Dairy Milk chocolate recipe used in Cadbury Crème Eggs sparked public outrage in January, as shoppers were told a sweeter 'standard cocoa mix chocolate' would be used instead this year

A spokesperson for Cadbury, bought by American giant Kraft in 2010, revealed back in January that the nation's favourite chocolate egg will no longer be coated in Dairy Milk.

An official announcement stated, 'It’s no longer Dairy Milk. It is similar, but not exactly Dairy Milk.'

Chefs at the Studio Kitchen aren't the first to turn Britain's best-loved Easter treat into a new concoction.

In 2013 a flury of alcoholic cocktails appeared in bars and clubs, mixing the gooey centre and melted chocolate  with spirits and liquor.

While The Mint Bar at Ireland's Westin Dublin Hotel served a Creme Egg Cocktail, London's Jewel Bar in Piccadilly Circus mixed-up a chocolatey Creme Egg mojito, which contained almost 1,000 calories.

In 2013 The Mint Bar at Dublin's Westin Dublin Hotel served the limited edition Creme Egg Cocktail, mixing vanilla infused Grey Goose Vodka and chocolate-bean flavoured Crème De Cacao, with white chocolate liqueur, cream and mini Cadbury Crème Eggs
