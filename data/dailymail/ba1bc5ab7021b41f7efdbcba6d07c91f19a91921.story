A motorist drove around Royal Windsor naked from the waist down, a court heard today.

Mark Dyer, 49, was wearing just a rolled up T-shirt and no trousers when he was spotted by a mother pushing her daughter along in a pushchair at a roundabout.

He shocked passersby as he travelled near the castle but was spared jailed today despite his exhibitionism after claiming in his defence he saw it as a way of 'expressing himself'.

Dyer, who had three previous convictions for similar offences, looked shame-faced as he appeared in the dock before Judge Angela Morris.

Prosecutor Tetteh Turkson told the judge sitting at Reading Crown Crown Court that on December 7, Dyer was convicted by a jury of indecent exposure.

Balding Dyer was not wearing trousers - only a rolled up T-shirt - when he exposed himself as he drove along Datchet Road in Windsor, Berkshire, on April 4 last year.

Neil Ross, defending, said his client was 'mortified' by his actions.

'He has a son, who lives with him. He (the defendant) is supporting him after his son lost his job,' he said.

'He is mortified by what has happened. He saw it as a way of expressing himself.'

The barrister said Dyer had written a letter to the victim about the incident.

However, it was unclear if he had apologised for his behaviour or if she had actually received it through the legal channels.

Judge Morris told the hearing: 'This is perfectly legitimate in society but it depends how it is exposed and where it is exposed.

'This is the fourth time you have been convicted of a like offence.

'You have to take the repercussions of your actions and understand about the effect this behaviour will have on other people.

'This was in public and caused alarm and distress,' she said.

However, Judge Morris decided not to send the father-of-one to prison.

'If any incident of this type happens in the future I have no doubt that the sentencing court will take a different view,' she told Dyer.

'If you repeat this you will go to prison.'

Judge Morris handed Dyer a four-month custodial sentence, which she suspended for 18 months.

Dyer will serve a supervision requirement order for 18 months and take part in a Thames Valley Police sex offenders' programme on a one-to-one basis with a specially trained officer.

He will also have to sign onto the Sex Offenders' Register and pay Â£1,000 pounds towards court costs. He was given 12 months to pay the amount.

Dressed in a smart black suit, blue shirt and tie, Dyer of The Chantrys, Farnham, Surrey, quickly left court after learning his fate without making any comment.
