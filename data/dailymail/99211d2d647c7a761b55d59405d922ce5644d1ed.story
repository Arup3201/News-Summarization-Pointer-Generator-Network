Hundreds of model train enthusiasts came together this weekend to celebrate the country's intense love affair with British railways.

More than 30 intricate models showing real and imaginary railway scenes from British locomotive history were put on display at the Festival of British Railway Modelling in Doncaster, the spiritual home of train travel.

The layouts, created under the theme 'Best of British', depicted a range of scales and gauges  from the pre-war era right up until privatisation in 1995, celebrating Britain's place as home of the steam locomotive.

Some of the scenes on display at the Doncaster Exhibition Centre included the imaginary stations of Alderford - described as a North West village in the 1980s - and Florinstone, a fictitious location based on the Somerset & Dorset Railway between Templecombe and Bournemouth.

There was also Northwick, which was based on a might-have-been, seaside town on the Bristol Channel between Weston-Super-Mare and Highbridge, and the Oulton Traction and Maintenance Depot, a fictitious area set in The Midlands which featured locomotives and rolling stock that typically ran from the late eighties until privatisation in 1995.

Another scene was The Clydach Railway, which represents a fictional preserved tourist railway situated somewhere on the coast of north-west Wales, while Owen's Bridge showed a temporary wooden structure build by British Army engineers in France some way behind the front lines of World War 1. 

The two-day event also featured more than 80 exhibitors, including specialist traders selling rare items, as well as free modelling tutorials.
