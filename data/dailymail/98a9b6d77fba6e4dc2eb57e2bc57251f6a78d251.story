Two men, from Manchester, were arrested on June 13 this year close to Joss Stone's home

A man appeared in court today to deny conspiring to murder the soul singer Joss Stone.

It was the first time the new charge of conspiracy to murder the 24-year-old singer had been revealed.

Kevin Liverpool, 34, appeared in the dock at Exeter Crown Court to plead not guilty to  conspiracy to murder, conspiracy to commit GBH and conspiracy to commit robbery.

He is accused with Junior Bradshaw, 31, of targeting Stone, whose hits include Fell In Love With A Boy, between January and June this year.

Bradshaw also appeared in court today but was not asked to enter pleas to any charges pending the result of psychiatric tests.

The two men, from Manchester, were arrested on June 13 this year, close to the Devon home of Stone, who has an estimated £9million fortune. Stone is a friend of the Duke and Duchess of Cambridge and attended their wedding.

The singer’s mother, Wendy Joseph, was in the public gallery during the short hearing.

Both men were remanded in custody ahead of a trial scheduled for August 6 next year.

Liverpool, who previously lived in Huddersfield, West Yorkshire, appeared in the dock wearing a hooped jumper. Bradshaw, who wears his hair in braids, wore a plain grey t-shirt.

The pair were arrested on the St Andrews Estate in Cullompton after being seen acting suspiciously in the area around the village of Langford in a Fiat Punto, several miles from the singer’s home near Ashill.

At a previous hearing, a court was told items including a samurai sword and notes mentioning Stone’s name were found in the car.

The singer released a statement at the time of the arrests saying she was 'absolutely fine' and 'getting on with life as normal' following the arrest of the two men

The singer released a statement at the time of the arrests saying she was ‘absolutely fine’ and ‘getting on with life as normal’ following the arrest of the two men.

She said at the time: ‘I’d like to thank everyone for their concern but I’m absolutely fine and getting on with life as normal while the police continue with their inquiries.’

Born Jocelyn Eve Stoker, Stone shot to fame in late 2003 with her multi-platinum debut album, The Soul Sessions. She has since sold more than 11 million copies of her five albums.

Her mother runs Exeter nightspot Mama Stone’s, a short walk across the city centre from the court building where the hearing took place.
