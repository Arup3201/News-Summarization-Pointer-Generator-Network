Forget oysters and Champagne, it seems the go-to food for the best lovers is the humble cheese toastie. 

According to a new survey of 4,600 people, almost three quarters (73 per cent) of toasted cheese sandwich eaters have sex at least once a month, compared with 63 per cent who steer clear of the comfort food. 

And as if bedroom prowess isn't enough, fans of grilled cheese are also more charitable and are more likely to travel than those who steer clear of the snack.

 A survey by social networking and dating site Skout revealed that grilled cheese lovers have more sex 

The type of cheese you put in your sandwich could also reveal a lot about you, the survey by US dating site Skout found.

If you like the simplicity of American cheese, maybe you’re easy going. 

But making the  sandwich with gourmet ingredients such as  a 15-year aged cheddar, indicates a more high maintenance personality.

In fact, 32 per cent of lovers of grilled cheese have sex at least six times a month. For those who don't like cheese toasties, only 27 per cent have sex with the same frequency.

The survey also discovered that 81 per cent of its participants who love grilled cheese - the US version of the snack, in which a cheese sandwich made with bread buttered on the outside, is fried until hot and crisp on the outside and gooey in the middle - say they have donated time, money or food to those in need. 

And although the sandwich might be the ultimate safe, warming comfort food, those who eat it are adventurous types. 

It's all in the filling! Turn up the heat in the bedroom by eating more grilled cheese sandwiches 

Some 84 per cent of grilled cheese fans love to travel, compared with 78 per cent of those who aren’t keen on the sandwich.

The survey also examined the kinds of cheese respondents preferred and whether they made their sandwiches with the crusts on or off. 

1. American - 41%

2. Cheddar - 33%

3. Mozzarella - 10%

4. Swiss cheese - 8%

5. Provolone -6%

6. Brie - 2% 

The most popular filling is American cheese, picked by 41 per cent, followed by cheddar (31 per cent) and, controversially, mozzarella (ten per cent). 

Continental varieties were at the bottom of the league table with only eight per cent picking Swiss cheese, six per cent opted for provolone and brie was the least popular and only chosen by two per cent.  

A picky ten per cent of participants say they would remove the crust from their sandwich but almost half (47 per cent) say they like to add extras such as pesto and tomato.

But the majority of toasted cheese sandwich lovers are purists, with 53 per cent preferring to make those with only cheese in the filling. 

The choice of bread is also a point for debate although 51 per cent pick white bread; a third (29 per cent) like wholemeal but only 13 per cent chooses sourdough, even fewer like rye (four per cent) and baguettes come bottom at only three per cent.
