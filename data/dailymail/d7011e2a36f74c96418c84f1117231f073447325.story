A retired NYPD cop allegedly brutally shot and killed his criminal investigator wife because of the cost of Christmas, police sources claim.

Tracey Young, 42, was shot seven times in her apartment in Queens, New York, on Saturday night - four times in the torso and three in the face.

Her husband Clarence Cash, 49, a retired Harlem cop, reportedly turned himself into a Manhattan precinct, saying: ‘I just shot my wife’.

‘My wife, she didn’t deserve that,’ he
told cops, reported the New York Post. ‘I’m a retired cop. I tried to 
kill myself, but I couldn’t do it.’

Part-time court guard Cash had just 
bought Ms Young an expensive Louis Vuitton handbag for Christmas, 
reported the New York Post.

But Ms Young had threatened to leave 
him after a fight over money and he reportedly had problems affording her Christmas 
presents.

The 6ft tall bodybuilder was charged 
with the murder which took place just after 11pm on Saturday night after
turning himself in on Sunday morning.

Cash had spent hours trying to work up
the courage to commit suicide after the fatal shooting, police sources 
told the New York Post.

Ms Young was a criminal tax 
investigator, reported the New York Daily News. Neighbours said they 
heard the couple fighting before the shooting.

'They heard them fighting and then 
they heard the gunshots,' a relative told the New York Daily News. 'They
said it was close to ten shots.'

Relatives said Ms Young’s mother had also been killed by her partner when Ms Young was a child.

'This is like history repeating itself - 31 years later she died just like her mother,' her cousin told the Daily News.

Young carried a gun for her work investigating the smuggling of untaxed cigarettes, her supervisor told the New York Daily News.

'She was an incredible investigator, 
one of the top ten in the state,' the supervisor said. 'One of the most 
dedicated people you’d ever see.'

Ms Young was the president of the condo association in her upscale building. Neighbours said there had been no signs of trouble.

Grief: Family and friends comfort each other outside Tracey Young's apartment after she was murdered on Saturday night

'They were a nice couple, he always 
called her ‘my sweet lady’ and things like that,' a neighbour who gave 
his name as Martin said.

'Nothing was suspicious - she even said that her husband got her a Louis Vuitton bag for Christmas because that’s what she wanted'

Maple Dong

Maple Dong, 28, the treasurer of the board, met with Young just hours before she was killed, reported the New York Daily News.

'Nothing was suspicious - she even 
said that her husband got her a Louis Vuitton bag for Christmas because 
that’s what she wanted,’ she said.

‘She didn’t say they had problems. This is so shocking. We saw them at board meetings together and they seemed fine.’

When Ms Dong saw police outside the building, her first reaction was to call Ms Young, unaware she was dead.

'I called her when I saw commotion 
outside the building and it went to voicemail. She was the one you would
call if anything happened.'
