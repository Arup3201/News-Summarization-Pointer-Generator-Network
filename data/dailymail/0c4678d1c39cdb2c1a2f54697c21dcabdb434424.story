IBM has set a culinary challenge for its multimillion-dollar supercomputer Watson, which has been programmed to tantalize taste buds.

A joint initiative between the tech company and food magazine Bon Appetit is trying to come up with new recipes by blending data on ingredients.

The kitchen is new territory for Watson which so far has been used to win at Jeopardy and to work on a cure for cancer.

Domestic science: IBM teamed up with Bon Appetit to see if the supercomputer could create new recipes

The cooking app - Chef Watson with Bon Appetit - works by using data the supercomputer has taken from more than 9,000 recipes.

New combinations are then created by Watson, which analyzes data on the compounds in ingredients, and how frequently they are combined in different dishes.

Tests so far have come up with some unusual, but delicious options such as a Bengali butternut BBQ sauce. 

Watson, which according to CNN cost IBM 
an estimated $900 million to develop, came up with the unusual 
combination after being asked to create an Indian sauce using butternut.

The designers likened the process to 'watching an episode of Chopped in real time'.

Challenge: The cooking test was new ground for Watson, which has previously been used in cancer research

'You get a bunch of ingredients and then decide what to do with them. The difference here is that every ingredient you’re presented with already goes well together, even if you don’t know it yet,' they said.

The combinations have excited and surprised the Bon Appetit team, who were curious about what creations Watson would deliver.

Editor in chief Adam Rapoport told the Daily News: 'We
 see the intersection of technology and food sparking new thinking and 
creativity not only in our own test kitchen, but in our reader's homes 
as well.'

He added that Watson had the power to 'unleash a chef's creativity'.

The magazine used Watson to help come up with new twists for July 4 barbecue favorite, and found that it came up with some interesting additions, but still needed the flair of a human cook to make the recipes work.

The full results of Watson's July 4 
combo included fennel-spiced ribs with tangy apple-mustard barbecue 
sauce, tamarind-cabbage slaw with crispy onions, and a blackberry-cherry
 cobbler with honey whipped cream.

New ground: IBM says its multi-million-dollar supercomputer is improved by such interactions as the food challenge

'We’re always trying to find some sort of hook, or kicker for our recipes ... it’s very hard to reinvent the wheel,' food editor Dawn Perry said.

With Watson however, 'you’re given the answer - the ingredient list - before you really know what questions to ask'.

She said the process made her consider combinations she may never have come up with on her own, 'like the Chinese spicy mustard on the ribs ... or the marjoram in the berry cobbler'.

For the IBM team, the cooking app offered another chance to test their supercomputer's capabilities.

Senior vice-president Mike Rhodin said IMB wanted to 'to help people discover the potential of cognitive computing systems'.

'These systems can understand vast 
amounts of data, compounds, and formulas as well as learn from 
interactions with people and information, in a far more intuitive way,' he added.
