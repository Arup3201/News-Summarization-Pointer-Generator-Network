Nottingham Forest are keen to turn Gary Gardner's loan move from Aston Villa into a permanent one.

The England Under 21 international scored a spectacular goal for Forest on Saturday to cap their 3-0 win over Reading and has impressed during his time at the City Ground.

Gardner has been a key figure in Dougie Freedman's revival which has seen Forest win five and draw one of their last six games, scoring 19 goals in the process and climbing to ninth in the table, ten points off the play-off positions.

The 22-year-old Gardner has enjoyed the change. He said: 'The manager has been very firm, he has been very organised and every one of us knows our job. There have been no excuses.

'If one player does not do their job, the whole team can fall down. The gaffer is not scared to pick you out in the dressing room if you do not do your job and, as a player, you do not like to be picked out. That is a major part. If you are not pulling your weight, you will not play. Everyone on the pitch wants to stay on the pitch.'

Gardner, who has been capped by England from U17 level through to U21, was touted as one of the game's best prospects but a couple of cruciate ligament injuries derailed his progress.

However, after a loan spell at Brighton and his stint at Forest, he has started to gain match sharpness and is beginning to fulfil his potential. Freedman has been delighted with Gardner's performances and wants him to be part of his ambitious project to take Forest into the Premier League.

That will not be straight forward though as Villa manager Tim Sherwood rates Gardner also. Sherwood is fully focused on Villa's relegation battle but has been kept informed of the young midfielder's performances as he continues to weigh up the players at his disposal.

Sherwood put great faith in youth during his time at Tottenham and Villa's highly-rated production line was a big pull for him when he pitched to replace Paul Lambert. Gardner is one of the players he is keen to work with and Sherwood won't contemplate any sale.
