Striker Andrej Kramaric has completed his switch from Rijeka to Leicester, subject to a work permit, the Croatian club have confirmed.

The 23-year-old has agreed a three-and-a-half-year deal with the Foxes, who are bottom of the Barclays Premier League.

Chelsea were interested in the Croatia international, who has two goals in four appearances for his country, but failed to strike a deal with Rijeka.

Kramaric scored 28 goals in 31 games for Rijeka this season ahead of his Leicester City move

Aston Villa flop Bosko Balaban was in attendance for Kramaric's move to the King Power Stadium, playing a role in the star's delegation team as the transfer was thrashed out.

Nigel Pearson is keen to bolster his squad in the January transfer window to battle against relegation from the Premier League and getting the deal for Kramaric represents a coup.

He scored 28 goals in 31 games for Rijeka this season and his arrival will boost the Foxes' firepower as they look to climb away from the foot of the table.

Leicester have managed to collect just 14 points from 20 games, scoring 19 goals along the way. 

Pearson's side host Aston Villa on Saturday.
