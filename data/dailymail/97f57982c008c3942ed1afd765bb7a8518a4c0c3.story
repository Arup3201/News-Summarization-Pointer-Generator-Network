President Obama is prepared to act unilaterally and suspend sanctions on Iran in order to help resolve nuclear talks by a self-imposed November 24 deadline, according to a report.

A senior White House official says, while the president lacks the power to lift the sanctions, he can and intends to suspend them in order to help negotiate away Iran's power to build nuclear arms.

'We wouldn't seek congressional legislation in any comprehensive agreement for years,' the official told the New York Times.

Feeling the pressure: Obama plans to sidestep Congress and suspend Iran sanctions in his quest to resolve nuclear talks by self-imposed November 24 deadline

Western governments want Iran to cut its uranium enrichment capacity so that it would take a long time to purify enough uranium for an atomic weapon. Tehran, which says all its nuclear work is for peaceful ends, has rejected demands to significantly reduce the number of enrichment centrifuges below the 19,000 it has now installed, of which roughly half are operating.

The U.S. official said gaps in negotiating positions must be narrowed in a way that 'ensures that all of the pathways for fissile material for a nuclear weapon are shut down.' 

Congress may not agree with those pathways, but they've known about the possibility of lifting sanctions since earlier this year when negotiators testified about the necessity to do so, reports the Times.

As of last week, it remained unclear just how close Obama and his allies were to meeting their self-imposed deadline. 

Iran's foreign minister said on Thursday that nuclear talks in Vienna this week were difficult but that progress was made and possible solutions discussed, sources who attended his briefing for Iranian media said.

Mohammad Javad Zarif spoke after a meeting on Wednesday with U.S. Secretary of State John Kerry and European Union foreign policy chief Catherine Ashton that lasted some six hours in the Austrian capital.

'It was very difficult, serious and intensive ... but instead of focusing on problems, we discussed solutions as well,' he said, the sources told Reuters. 'There was progress in all the fields.'

Zarif also said he would next meet with Kerry and Ashton in three-four weeks' time, Iranian state television reported. Ashton coordinates talks with Iran on behalf of six world powers, including the United States.
