This is the shocking moment a police officer tried to trick a driver into admitting he had marijuana in his car during a routine traffic stop - because 'everyone who plays frisbee golf smokes weed'.

Officer Aaron King was captured on video pulling over Scott Beckwith and giving him a warning about driving without any headlights in Ankeny, Iowa, earlier this month.

But after spotting Mr Beckwith's frisbee golf bag on the backseat, he started to question the driver about his passion for the game, before quickly moving on to the topic of marijuana.

During the interrogation, he claimed all frisbee golf players smoke weed, asked Mr Beckwith how much of the substance he had on him and told him he wanted to search his car.

SCROLL DOWN FOR VIDEO

Routine traffic stop: Officer Aaron King is pictured trying to trick driver Scott Beckwith into admitting he has marijuana in his car after pulling him over in Ankeny, Iowa, earlier this month for driving without headlights

Although he eventually let the motorist go, footage of the traffic stop - taken by a passenger in the car - was later uploaded to YouTube by user 'TheResistantCow'.

Now, Ankeny Police Department's chief, Gary Mikulec, has apologized for the video  deeming it 'foolish' and 'not representative of the department's training or interactions with the public'. 

In the footage, Mr King is heard warning Mr Beckwith about driving without headlights, before asking him: 'You play frisbee golf?', to which the driver replies: 'I do, actually. I play out at Heritage (Park).'

The officer then says: 'OK. I need you to answer me a question. Why is it that everybody that plays Frisbee golf smokes weed?' Mr Beckwith quickly insists: 'No, it’s not everybody' 

However, Mr King is not convinced, responding: 'It’s everybody, man. You can’t tell me you've never smoked weed before.'

The motorist then says, 'I’m not gonna tell you one way or another', prompting the officer to laugh and exclaim: 'See, there you go. How much weed do you have in the car today?'.

Although Mr Beckwith denies having any marijuana, the officer responds: 'You understand you’re free to go and everything but you wouldn’t have a problem with me looking through your car?'

At this point, Mr Beckwith argues: 'I actually would', adding: 'Just because I have a disc golf bag doesn’t mean that every disc golfer does have weed.'

Mr King then replies: 'So you have weed in the car then is what you’re saying?' The motorist answers: 'No what I'm saying is I would say I have a problem with you searching my car because you’re profiling me based on being a disc golfer.'

During the interrogation, which ends with Mr King telling the motorist 'You're free to go', Mr Beckwith informs the officer that he is being recorded on video.

However, this does not appear to faze Mr King, who replies that he is also recording audio and video footage of the traffic stop. 

In a statement via Facebook, Ankeny Police Department said of the video: 'The officer engages the driver in a line of questioning that is foolish and not representative of the Ankeny Police Dept.'s training or interactions with the public.

'This verbal exchange did not meet the level of professionalism expected of Ankeny police officers.

'Ankeny Police Chief Gary Mikulec respectfully apologizes for the officer's demeaning statement and assures that the video has been preserved for an internal investigation.'

Speaking to KCCI News, Chief Mikulec said he was 'extremely disappointed' by the video, which was uploaded to YouTube on October 2.

He added that the department is yet to receive a complaint from the driver, but will be getting in touch with him to determine any discipline for Mr King.

According to Professor Robert Rigg, of Drake University Law School, Mr King broke the law by trying to search a vehicle during an equipment violation stop.

'What the officer did after that was try to extend that stop into a general search of the defendant’s car, or the individual’s car. That’s not permissible anymore,' he told WHOTV.com.

He added that even if Mr Beckwith had allowed Mr King to search the car and the officer had found something illegal, the evidence would likely be deemed invalid and thrown out of court.

Like regular golf, frisbee golf is a game of skill and accuracy but instead of hitting small balls, players throw a frisbee-like disc at various targets around a grassy course.
