Manchester United and Liverpool target Martin Odegaard has spoken of his admiration for German giants Bayern Munich, branding them the 'best club in the world'.

The 15-year-old attacking midfielder, dubbed the 'new Messi' in Norway, plays for Tippeligaen club Stromsgodset but has attracted scouts from Manchester, Liverpool, Barcelona and Real Madrid.

He is a life-long Liverpool fan that has trained with Manchester United in England, but it seems his time  in Germany with Bundesliga pacesetters Bayern particularly piqued his interest.

'They won the Champions League, so they're the best club in the world,' Odegaard says in a documentary made about the player that turns 16 until December. 'They play good football, with lots of good players.'

Odegaard became the youngest player in the history of the European Championships when he came on as a substitute in Norway's 2-1 win over Bulgaria in October. 

He has to juggle homework with training and playing, but Odegaard promises he's  taking it easy with a big future in mind.

'If you get carried away now, you won't get far in 10 years,' Odegaard adds. 'I'm supposed to be at my best then, not now. That I know.'
