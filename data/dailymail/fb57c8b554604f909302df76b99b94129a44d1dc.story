Olympic swimmer Rebecca Adlington has made no secret of the fact she dislikes the shape of her nose. Now the I'm A Celebrity contestant is said to have had cosmetic surgery to give her the perfect profile.

Rebecca's situation is one that 21-year-old trainee optician Kate can identify with after she grew up hating a bump she had on her nose which made her paranoid about her appearance.

But while Rebecca's nose looks lovely, Kate's bid for perfection went horribly wrong and left her nose even more misshapen than before.

Paranoid: Kate as a teenager when she was self-conscious about her nose

Desperate measures: Kate hated her profile so much she had a nose job when she was 18 which left her with scarring, right

Disguise: She was so paranoid about her nose she wore glasses even though she didn't need them

'I
 hated the fact I had a bigger nose than everyone else and there was 
a bump on the side of it,' reveals Kate.

'When I first started driving I didn't want 
anyone to sit next to me in the passenger seat as they would then have a side ways view of me and my nose. Everyone wants a perfect nose so I decided to have surgery.'

The trainee optician decided to go under the knife when she was 18, hoping that the operation would be the answer to her problems and rid her of insecurities.

'I went to the cheapest place I could find and got it done,' she admits. But the lack of research and the cheap deal resulted in a disastrously bungled operation. 

She was left with more lumps and bumps, a scar across the bridge of her nose and constantly had a bad smell in her nostrils.

'I've been left with more problems than when I first went in. I wish I hadn't had it done. It looks horrendous,' she said.

Kate spent Â£2500 on the procedure but when she complained she was unhappy with her new look, she was told by the clinic to be patient and wait for the swelling and redness to go down. A year later with her nose still swollen, she returned to the clinic to be told the surgeon had fled the country.

Three years on, she still has to wear glasses to hide the bumps and scar on her nose despite having perfect vision.

Aside from the aesthetic problems she was left with after the inadequate rhinoplasty, Kate was also left with worrying physical complications.

She said: 'Now I get nose bleeds quite often, once every two days.'

Kate agreed to appear on TLC show Extreme Beauty Disasters to see if they could salvage her damaged nose.

Cosmetic surgeon Dr Vik Vijh examined her and was alarmed to see her nostrils were inflamed and her nasal lining in tatters.

Now: The optician feels more confident and said she won't wear glasses anymore

Of her scar, he said: 'There is no reason to make an 
incision in the nose at the bridge which makes me think somebody 
slipped. It looks to me like the surgeon slipped with his chisel and 
put it straight through the skin.'

Dr Vijh said Kate's only option was to go back under the knife so he could see what was going on beneath her skin following the previous botched op.

He was shocked when he discovered the source of the bad scent Kate could constantly smell.

The last surgeon had been so clumsy he had damaged Kate's respiratory lining, causing a cyst to form. This was a source of infection which was causing Kate's nose bleeds, discomfort and the bad smell.                                                   

'That shouldn't be there, that's not normal,' Dr Vijh said on discovering the cyst. He was able to remove it and then strengthened out Kate's nose by realigning nasal cartilage on the top of the nose.

Commenting on the case, Dr Anthony Erian of the London Centre for Cosmetic Surgery (lcas.com) said: 'The
 nose is a hugely important facial feature, so although this operation 
is straightforward anatomically, it requires the most meticulous 
surgical skills, and the aesthetic anticipation and perception of an 
artist, in order to form a new nose that will blend in and balance the 
whole face.

'With
 a reputable surgeon performing rhinoplasty many problems can be reduced
 or corrected - long noses can be shortened, crooked noses straightened,
 bumps and hooks removed, wide noses can be narrowed, rounded tips 
removed and nostrils made smaller.

'I would always 
advise finding a safe pair of hands when it comes to this delicate 
operation.'

After her second operation done by Dr Vijh, Kate was delighted with the results.

'When I used to look at my nose I could just see the lump,' she reveals. 'Now it looks nice and straight. It makes me a lot more confident, I certainly won't be needing the spectacles anymore.'
