A team of West Coast chefs celebrated Thanksgiving in an over-the-top way by creating a protein monstrosity that makes the decadent turducken seem practically austere by comparison.

The epic, artery-clogging Roast Beast, which was served up at Bourbon Steak and Pub in Santa Clara, California, on Thanksgiving Day, combined in itself seven different types of protein all mounted on a massive rotisserie and cooked to greasy perfection.

The meaty menace, which has been given the moniker 'lambpigcow' on Twitter, was made up of 24 quail; 12 chickens; 8 ducks; 6 turkeys; 2 lambs; a pig and a blanket-size side of wagyu beef butterflied open to wrap all the other ingredients.

Not your grandma's Thanksgiving dinner: Bourbon Steak and Pub restaurant in Santa Clara, California, cooked up this meaty monstrosity dubbed the Roast Beat for Thanksgiving last week 

Meat madness: The culinary madmen combined 24 quails; 12 chickens; 8 ducks; 6 turkeys; 2 lambs; a pig and a blanket-size side of wagyu beef for the gargantuan dish 

Unusual cooking tools: The colossal meat course was bundled with a 20-foot metal garden fence

Burning at the stake: The cooks required a huge rotisserie to cook the meaty beast to perfection 

To keep everything in place during the hours-long roasting process, the mad culinary geniuses at the Santa Clara eatery bundled the colossal meat course with a 20-foot metal garden fence, secured it in place with eight stainless steel clamps, and mounted it on an enormous rotisserie.

Besides the various layers of poultry and meat, the beastly creation also included chestnut and turkey sausage stuffing.

The mastermind behind the epic dish was Seattle chef David Varley, formerly of Bourbon Steak and Pub, who returned to his old haunt last week to oversee the creation of the gargantuan roast.

Varley's Seattle restaurant, RN17, and Bourbon Steak and Pub located at the San Francisco 49ers' Levi's Stadium, are both owned by chef and restaurateur Michael Mina.

Mastermind: The Roast Beast was the brainchild of Seattle chef David Varley, formerly of Bourbon Steak and Pub, who returned to his old restaurant to orchestrate the tailgate 

Dinner is served! The final product was served to hungry football fans along with a pair of turkeys, a half dozen Seattle sea chickens and a gravy fountain 

Varley’s edible colossus dubbed the Roast Feast was served up at the Thanksgiving Tailgate party after the Seattle Seahawks beat the 49ers 19-3 in San Francisco.

The hulking slab of meaty goodness was presented alongside a pair of plump turkeys, a half dozen Seattle sea chickens in honor of the Seahawks - who ended up defeating their San Francisco opponents 19-3 - and a gravy fountain .

‘I'm taking a few years off from working on thanksgiving after this,’ David Varley joked on Instagram after the holiday dinner. 

The mad culinary scientists at the Bourbon Steak and Pub in Santa, Clara, California, brought together 24 quails; 12 chickens; 8 ducks; 6 turkeys; 2 lambs; a pig and a blanket-size side of wagyu beef for one epic dish dubbed the 'Roast Beast.'

The preparation of the tailgate feast required a 20-foot metal fence, clamps and a massive rotisserie to cook the gargantuan roast to perfection. 

The birds used in the preparation were stuffed with a mixture of chestnut and turkey sausage.

A team of cooks butterflied a side of beef and used it to wrap all the other ingredients, securing the entire creation with the metal fence.
