Asking a young child to talk about Nelson Mandela and the concept of human rights, equality or the right to individual self-realisation is quite a leap from asking them about their favourite food.

But that's exactly what Amnesty International has done, in a heart-warming video called Human Rights Heroes Of The Future, which poses such questions to children ranging in age from five to nine.

One girl is asked: What did Nelson Mandela do?

She says: 'He stood up for what he believed - that white people shouldn't just have all the fun and black people should have fun as well.' 

Another is asked: Who was Nelson Mandela?

She replies: 'Nelson Mandela was a man who thought that black people should just have the amount of right just as the white people should. 

'But then he was put into jail because of what he said - and then he finally went out because people were protesting for him to come out. And then there was a song Free Nelson Mandela - and everything kind of became how he wanted it to be.' 

Meanwhile, an equally challenging poser is put to a 'short five-year-old' boy: What does equality look like?

His sweet response? 'If there was one man over here like he was five years old, and one man over here like he was five years old too, they would all be the same size.'

'Nelson Mandela was a man who thought that black people should just have the amount of right just as the white people should.' This was the reply to one of a series of human rights questions put by Amnesty International to children aged five to nine

'Fear - the more you worry about it, the bigger it gets... and the more you think positively, the more fear would be, like friendly - you wouldn't worry about anything, and have a great time basically'

'If there was one man over here like he was five years old, and one man over here like he was five years old too, they would all be the same size'

Other questions put to the youngsters included topics that might faze some grown-ups.

For example: At a time of daunting global events, many people are afraid. What would you advise?

A boy, aged about nine's reply? 'Fear - the more you worry about it, the bigger it gets... and the more you think positively, the more fear would be, like friendly - you wouldn't worry about anything, and have a great time basically.' 

The video was released by the human rights organisation to coincide with the publication of its new book Dreams Of Freedom on World Book Day.

The book combines the words of human rights heroes such as Nelson Mandela, the Dalai Lama, Anne Frank, Chief Standing Bear, Malala and Aung San Suu Kyi with beautiful illustrations from international artists including Oliver Jeffers and Chris Riddell. 

In a time when children across the world are traumatised, frightened and confused by news events, the aim of the book is to empower them to explore hard-won rights and understand how precious they are.

'The world wouldn't be the same... the world would be terrible - and it would be quite boring'

'Being unique without anybody stopping you being unique'

Author and former Children’s Laureate Michael Morpurgo wrote in the foreword to the book: 'Dreams Of Freedom is a feast of visual stories – brave words and beautiful pictures, woven together to inspire young readers to stand up for others and to make a difference. 

'It gives me great hope for the freedom of future generations.

'I have grown up, not in a perfect country by any means, but in a society where, by and large, we can say what we like, write what we like, be who we want to be, so long as we do not threaten the liberty of others and so long as we respect their rights.

'What we can forget, if we are not careful, is that it was not always like this. These rights have been fought for, died for, argued over, for centuries. 

'Indeed the struggle to protect and defend our freedom goes on, both in our own country and in the world beyond.'

Kate Allen, Amnesty’s UK Director, said: 'In a time when many children can't help seeing news about threats from terrorism and other atrocities, this book celebrates heroism and shows how important it is for all of us to stand up and make a difference.

'Every child should be given the strength to stand up for themselves and each other. 

'There is no better book to inspire and empower young readers, to give them courage and confidence for the future.'
