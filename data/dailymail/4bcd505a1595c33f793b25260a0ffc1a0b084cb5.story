A unique Rolls-Royce customised by The Who rocker John Entwistle to carry his pack of Irish wolfhounds is to go under the hammer.

The 1980 Silver Shadow was owned by Entwistle while he was living in an English country mansion, in Gloucestershire.

He had the car sent to an unknown coach builder who converted it from a normal saloon into the estate body, also known as a shooting brake.

Big back end: The Who rocker sent his saloon Rolls-Royce to a specialist coach builder to be extended into an estate so his dogs could fit in the back

The luxury British car makers never made an estate version so rich owners were forced to commission specialist coach-builders to extend the body work in order to have one.

The rocker would then use the customised Rolls as the perfect car for ferrying his large pack of dogs from A to B.

After his tragic death in Las Vegas in 2002 from a cocaine-induced heart attack, his beloved motor was sold to a Scottish laird by his family.

The owners have now decided to sell the Rolls-Royce, which is expected to sell for between £12,000 and £16,000 when it goes under the hammer next month.

Well loved: It might not be to everyone's taste, but the current Scottish owners have looked after it well, keeping it away from the elements in a garage

John Entwistle, who died in 2022, used the Rolls as the perfect car for ferrying his large pack of dogs

A spokesman for Bonhams, which is selling the car, said: 'There was never an official factory-bodied estate version of the Shadow but that did not deter those wealthy enough from commissioning their own.

'The car has been kept at an estate in Perthshire, Scotland where it was mainly used for grouse shooting, and has been garage stored in a "bubble" to maintain ideal air temperature.'

The brown car has a 6,750cc V8 engine, cream leather upholstery and a mahogany dash and steering wheel.

Under the hammer: The bespoke brown Rolls will go up for auction with Bonhams next month

The auctioneer expects the strange vehicle to fetch between £12,000 and £16,000
