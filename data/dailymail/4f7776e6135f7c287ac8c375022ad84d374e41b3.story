When Kate Moss was spotted filming a new Stuart Weitzman advert in London this week, it wasn't just the fact she was wearing no knickers and no bra that caught everyone's attention.

The 39-year-old supermodel was trotting about with tousled hair, sporting a whisper-thin beige T-shirt, grey suede thigh-high boots and a cream shagpile coat.... as was her young body double.

Tongues have been wagging ever since, the fashion word abuzz with rumours as to who in the name of Karl Lagerfeld this Mosselganger was. And now we know.

The Kate-a-like has been revealed by British Vogue as Oregon-born, LA-based beauty Natalie Morris, who is signed to Storm agency, the same as Moss herself, Cindy Crawford and Cara Delevingne.

Spot the difference: Kate Moss was seen with a body double while filming an advert in London on Monday, and the model has now been revealed as Oregon-born Natalie Morris

A UK size eight, Natalie is 5ft 8ins - exactly the same height as Moss - and has green eyes, dark blonde hair, long legs and similarly well-defined cheekbones as her lookalike.

Spies at Vogue have unearthed juicy details about Natalie's acting career, too. Not only did she appear in 
Enrique Iglesias' music video Finally Found You as his hot and heavy
love interest, but she has also popped up in TV shows including W, Portlandia and Smallville.

She has also been in comedies including Good Luck Chuck and The A List.

In her spare time she hangs out with her mother and her pet poodle Shabboo, reading 19th 
Century Russian literature, eating Persian food and collecting Chanel 
make-up, according to Facebook.

Mosselganger: Natalie is signed to Storm modelling agency, the same one that looks after Kate Moss, Cindy Crawford and Cara Delevingne

Who wore it best? Kate did her best to give the younger model a run for her money

On show: Natalie Morris was more than happy for her coat to fall open to reveal her vest and knickers

The excitement surrounding Morris kicked off on Monday, when Kate, who rose to fame in the 
Nineties, stepped out by the restaurant Launceston Place to start 
filming she kept her body under wraps beneath a large white fur coat.

Apart from her thigh-high boots and a little bit of vest peeking out, Kate didn't appear to be wearing much else.

In
 fact she was wearing so little that she seemed to have forgotten her 
underwear as when she stepped out of the car she gave a little too much 
away beneath her flesh coloured tights, which she wore to create the 
illusion of flawless skin.

But unusually the star, who is married to Jamie Hince, came over all shy and left the majority of flashing to her body double.

100% Moss? Kate Moss in the Stuart Weitzman Fall Winter 2013 campaign shoot... but where does Kate end and Natalie begin?

Not giving it away: Kate seemed reluctant to open her coat and show her vest beneath

Too much: It seemed Kate was wearing just a pair of flesh coloured tights without any knickers on

Rising
 to the challenge of being Kateâ€™s counterpart the fresh-faced model 
confidently strutted around with the fur coat wide open.

An onlooker who saw the filming 
taking place near Gloucester Road said: 'It's no surprise Kate had a 
body double on set as her skin appeared a little ropey. Much to everyone's surprise the usually confident Kate looked a little on the shy side.'

The appearance of a body double raised questions about just how often Kate's body has been replaced in recent campaigns.

Top of her game: It's surprising that the well-known model would choose to have someone act as her body double
