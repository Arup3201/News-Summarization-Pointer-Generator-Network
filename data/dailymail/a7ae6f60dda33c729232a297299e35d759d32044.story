Hull KR have released prop forward Jonny Walker from his contract with immediate effect.

The 23-year-old former Huddersfield and Castleford player was dropped by the Robins, along with overseas player Wayne Ulugia, for disciplinary reasons last month.

Ulugia was sacked with more than a year left on his contract and Hull KR say they have agreed to release Walker to enable him to pursue regular first team football elsewhere.

In a statement, Hull KR said: 'The club would like to wish Jonny all the best for the future.'

Details of the disciplinary reasons have not been released.

Walker, whose twin brother Adam is still with Hull KR, joined the club from Castleford in the off season but made just eight appearances in a campaign disrupted by injury.
