Conservative MP Charlotte Leslie said the NHS must no longer be taken for granted

Cheats are fleecing the NHS of at least £100 million a year by falsely claiming that they are entitled to free prescriptions.

The Mail on Sunday has discovered that patients are simply walking into pharmacies and claiming they are on benefits or a low income – and a 'scandalously careless' checking system means few people are ever caught.

Pharmacists told undercover reporters that it was ‘very, very rare’ for someone to be investigated – let alone fined – while one even appeared to condone abuse of the system.

According to latest figures, prescription fraud costs the NHS £100 million – enough to pay for 4,000 extra nurses. A new report into the problem will be published later this summer, and experts believe that the figures could climb even higher.

In England, everyone aged 19 to 59 must pay the £7.85 prescription charge unless they can prove they are receiving benefits, are on a low income, or have certain medical conditions. However, the system is open to abuse because patients simply have to tick a box on the back of the form to state they are exempt from the fee.

Pharmacists should ask to see evidence such as a benefits letter, but undercover Mail on Sunday reporters found they sometimes do not. All the pharmacy staff we spoke to said they would dispense medication free of charge even without seeing proof of entitlement. This is in line with official guidance, which states there is ‘no question of refusing to dispense the prescribed item’ to those who don’t have the evidence on them. Staff should instead tick a box on the form stating ‘evidence not seen’, which can then trigger a fraud investigation.

Patients caught falsely claiming free medication must pay back the £7.85 prescription fee plus a £100 penalty charge (posed by models)

But our reporters were told  that rarely happened. An assistant at Morrisons Pharmacy in Rubery, Birmingham, said that when this box was ticked, forms could get ‘pulled out’ for questioning, before adding: ‘It’s very, very rare, though.’ And in a clear breach of the guidelines, another pharmacy worker said she would not tick the ‘evidence not seen’ box, thus ensuring no investigation would be launched. The member of staff at Boots in North End Road, Fulham, West London, said: ‘I won’t tick this box to say I haven’t seen it. I’m not like that.’

Our reporters did not collect any prescriptions during their investigations. Patients caught falsely claiming free medication must pay back the £7.85 prescription fee plus a £100 penalty charge.

But the investigation process is lengthy, involving local health authorities, the Health Service’s anti-fraud arm – NHS Protect – and other bodies such as the Department for Work and Pensions. NHS Protect could not say how many prescriptions it investigated last year, nor how many penalty charges were issued.

Its last report, published five years ago, found one in 50 claims for free prescriptions was fraudulent, resulting in drugs worth £100 million being handed out that patients should have paid for.

Since then the cost of drugs dispensed for free has risen about £1 billion to £8.28 billion in 2011.

Cuts have also forced NHS Protect to scale down its anti-fraud work in this area, according to Professor Mark Button, director of the Centre for Counter Fraud Studies at Portsmouth University. He said: ‘Their resources have declined significantly over the past five or six years. I would guess that there is not as much enforcement work going on as there used to be.’

The NHS Business Services Authority, which runs NHS Protect, has cut its running costs by 41 per cent since 2006, according to the latest annual report.

No new anti-fraud policies have been introduced since 2007, said a spokesman, but he stressed that the number of investigations was determined by local health authorities, not NHS Protect.

Conservative MP Charlotte Leslie, a member of the Commons’ Health Select Committee, said last night: ‘Clearly, the system for checking if people are actually exempt from prescription charges is scandalously careless. It seems pharmacists just tick a box and they’ve got a happy customer.’

She added: ‘Sadly, this is an example of a wider attitude across the NHS system that the Health Service is literally free. But it is not. Everything in the NHS costs. We can no longer take it for granted and must urgently plug this expensive, leaky institution.’

Stephen Barclay, a Conservative member of the Public Accounts Committee, said controls on prescription fraud were ‘clearly non-existent’. He added: ‘It is deeply frustrating given that I have repeatedly raised concerns over NHS fraud in Parliament.’

Dr Clare Gerada, chairman of the Royal College of GPs, called for a ‘fundamental review of prescriptions’. But a spokesman for the Royal College of Pharmacists said it was ‘not their job to police the Government’s prescription exemption system’, adding: ‘Guidance is very clear that pharmacists must put the clinical needs of a patient first, and not deny someone access to lifesaving medicines because they haven’t got proof of exemption.’

The Health Department said it took NHS fraud ‘extremely seriously’, adding that NHS Protect would ‘continue to seek the strongest possible sanctions for people who perpetrate it’.

A Boots spokesman said: ‘If it was proved that a pharmacist actively sought to wrongly fill out an exemption, Boots UK would take the matter very seriously and it would be grounds for a serious investigation.’
