MPs last night condemned a ruling that allows a convicted terrorist to continue walking the streets of Britain 12 years after he first arrived here.

Ministers are powerless to expel the 50-year-old Algerian, known only as AH, even though he was refused asylum on the grounds that, as a terrorist, he cannot claim refugee status.

He cannot be booted out of the UK because his ‘life and liberty’ are judged to be in jeopardy if he returns to his home country, where he was convicted in 1993 of complicity in the bombing of Algiers airport, which killed nine people.

He was also imprisoned in France for two years for his involvement in a terrorist group.

France simply expelled him as an ‘undesirable’, after which he fled to the UK – where he remains because the British system has not managed to do the same.

Tory backbencher Douglas Carswell ridiculed the idea that a terrorist could secure refuge with the argument that his life is at risk if he is sent home.

He said: ‘If you dedicate your career to blowing people up, your life may well be at risk – but that’s an occupational hazard of being a terrorist; it’s not our problem.’

Mr Carswell added: ‘It’s not just AH who should be in the dock, it is the immigration tribunal system which prevents us from removing a convicted killer.

‘Until we have democratic accountability over immigration tribunals, we can have no confidence in them. Why should our country be a haven for Algerian terrorists? What part of “get out” does the immigration system not understand?

‘Our country is signed up to the same idiotic human rights as France, but somehow France manages to stand up to the security of their country better than we do. Yet again, we seem to be the mugs in all of this.’

The legal battle has cost British 
taxpayers hundreds of thousands of pounds, and all the while it is 
believed AH has been living on benefits.

The Upper Immigration Tribunal judges
rejected his latest appeal last month, but AH is challenging their 
ruling in the Court of Appeal.

Now the Home Office is hoping to get a bilateral deal with Algeria in a bid to secure his deportation. This could include guarantees about his treatment on return to the country.

It would be similar to a treaty signed between Britain and Jordan which resulted in the deportation of hate cleric Abu Qatada earlier this year.

Another Tory MP, Philip Davies, said: 
‘This is completely ridiculous. This man is not a British citizen, he is
a foreign national and if we don’t want him to be in our country we 
should be able to kick him out. People will be staggered that he is 
still here after 12 years.’

The terrorist cannot be named because the Upper Immigration Tribunal granted him anonymity.

Last month’s hearing is the latest stage in a mammoth legal battle fought by the terrorist, who first sought asylum here in 2001.

In 1993, he was convicted in Algeria of involvement in a bombing at Algiers airport the year before. He was sentenced to death in his absence.

At the time of that trial he was in France, and in October 1999 he was convicted there of being a member of an organisation created with a view to the preparation of acts of terrorism.

AH was sentenced to two years’ imprisonment and on his release in July 2001 he was made subject to an exclusion order.

He fled to the UK, where he claimed asylum. That claim was rejected but he has remained in the UK ever since.
