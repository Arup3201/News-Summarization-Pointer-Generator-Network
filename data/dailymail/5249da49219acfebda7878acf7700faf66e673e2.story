For most teenagers it seems their parents were put on
this world to embarrass them.

From kissing in public, to using the latest slang, children across the country are united by their parents’ toe-curling antics, a study shows.

The new 'Cringe Index', compiled by television station Gold lists the worst things parents can do to mortify their children.

Patsy and Eddie, played by Joanna Lumley and Jennifer Saunders in the BBC's hit sitcom, Absolutely Fabulous, constantly embarrassed Eddie's daughter with their outrageous clothes. Copying your child's dress sense came in tenth on the Cringe Index

Topping the embarrassment list for children is an unexpected sex scene
cropping up during a movie when they are watching a film with their parents.

In fact the survey, which was conducted as part of the research for new sitcom You, Me & Them, showed the
mere mention of sex is enough to get the nation's youths running for cover.

Public displays of affection between their mother and father
also had many of the 2,000 respondents squirming. 

In third place was parents trying to 'get down' with the latest text slang, using words like 'OMG' or 'LOL' or ‘YOLO’ (you only live once).

Not far behind was discovering 'dodgy histories' on your parents' computer.

Clothing is another minefield for parents and copying your son's or daughter's dress sense will have them dying with shame.

Parents should also beware the midlife crisis - fathers buying spandex to wear on their flash new bike caused 30 per cent of children to
recoil in horror.

A parent's taste in literature can have a similar affect, and discovering their mother's erotic novels - such as Fifty Shades of Grey is sixth on the 
list.

The index also 
suggests that the raucous, champagne-swigging Eddie and Patsy in 
Absolutely Fabulous are showing parents the blueprint for embarrassing 
their children, with drunken behaviour ranking eighth.

The study also revealed most parents probably aren't aware
of their son's or daughter's distress, with two thirds of youngsters likely to suffer in
silence rather than confront their parents.
