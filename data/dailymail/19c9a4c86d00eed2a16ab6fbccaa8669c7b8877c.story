Keeping control of boisterous toddlers as they play-fight in public is an enduring problem for many mothers. 

So spare a thought for this female elephant struggling to keep her brood in one piece in the Kenyan wild. 

The animals were seen jumping over one another and raising their front legs as they wandered through the Entim Camp in the Maasai Mara as their mother watched on.

Eventually they were pulled apart, by the ever-stronger pull of their mother's trunk. 

Wildlife photographer Margot Raggett captured their joy from a safari truck nearby, producing a stunning sequence of images that will be used as part of an anti-poaching campaign.

'They were running around like toddlers, out of control and having a fantastic time.' Ms Raggett, said. 

'While they were chasing and jumping up on each other the older elephants seemed to be futilely trying to keep them under control. It was so funny. 

'Eventually one decided to come and check out our vehicle and even mock-charged us at one point trying to make itself appear bigger than it was! 

'The innocence and playfulness of young elephants can bring hours of entertainment and fun.'
