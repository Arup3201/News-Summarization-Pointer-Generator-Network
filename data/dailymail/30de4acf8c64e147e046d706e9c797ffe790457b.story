Gilberto Martinez was
almost penniless when he left Cuba in 2005  to start a new life
in the United States.

Eight years later he returned a rich man and built a large
house in his dusty neighborhood on the outskirts of Havana.

Flush with money, he drove an Audi and a Mercedes and
started a music career under the artistic name 'Gilbertman'. 

But
two weeks ago, his flash lifestyle caught up with him when a swarm of Cuban police descended on his home and
arrested him.

Boastful: The accused credit card fraudster, Gilberto Martinez, found living in Cuba, poses on Facebook with wads of cash on his biceps

Taking advantage: Like American music producers the videos he appeared in includes guns, strobe lights and scantily clad women

No taste: In the Cuban fugitive's rich video he says 'I have a lot of money in the bank,' he croons while throwing piles of cash around

'It was dramatic. There were dozens of cops, in cars, sirens
blaring. They blocked off the street,' said one neighbor who
asked not to be identified.

It is not clear what charges the 28-year-old Martinez faces
in Cuba but, whatever they are, the U.S. government also wants
to bring him in.

Florida court records show he is a fugitive and faces up to
16 years in prison after he was indicted on Sept. 30 in a Secret
Service credit card fraud probe involving $150,000 of purchases
at stores including Toys'R'Us and Babies'R'Us.

In recent years, dozens of Medicare, credit card and
mortgage fraudsters who came to the United States from Cuba have
avoided prosecution by jumping bail and fleeing to their
homeland.

Under President Obama's new Cuba policy, the fraudsters, who
have cost U.S. tax payers hundreds of millions of dollars, could
finally come under the long arm of U.S. law.

Talks aimed at restoring diplomatic relations after decades
of hostility began this week in Havana, and U.S. officials say
issues of legal cooperation will be raised in the months ahead.

Show-off: The young music artist publicly flaunted his riches: a spacious new house, a fleet of motorcycles and luxury cars, designer clothes and stately furniture

Star status: He was wanted in the United States for stealing people's credit card numbers and ripping off stores across Florida

Caught: Cuban police earlier this month raided the gated home of a U.S. fugitive in the town of Guanabacoa, outside Havana

Justice: Cuban officials aren't talking, but pictures and video shot by neighbors show armed, SWAT-like teams standing guard outside Martinez's home

In the past there has been occasional cooperation regarding
low level fugitives, including a Florida couple repatriated in
2013 after they kidnapped two small sons they had lost custody
of due to a drug arrest and fled to Cuba on a sailboat.

'We would hope to be able to expand some of that cooperation
in the future as more normal relations go forward, and to have,
frankly, a better relationship on that kind of issue,' a senior
State Department official said this week.

'We are starting to compile a list of those fugitives that
we believe may have flown back to their native country,' said
Barry Golden, spokesman for the U.S. Marshals Service in Miami.

'But as you can imagine it's very hard to confirm if they
are there. It's not like we can call the U.S. embassy and ask
them - at least not yet.'

Not so in the case of Martinez who posted dozens of photos
of himself in Cuba on social media. 'He's all over YouTube so we
can pretty much verify he is there,' said Golden, who confirmed
that Martinez has an outstanding federal warrant.

For days after his arrest, Cuban police were stationed
outside his single story hacienda-style home occupying almost an
entire block, and several officers were seen inside apparently
conducting an inventory.

It is not clear why Martinez was arrested or on what charges
and no mention was made of the raid in Cuban media. Cuba's 
government does not usually comment on police actions. 

No tact: Martinez, 28, posted hundreds of pictures of himself on Facebook living in Cuba like a Hollywood celebrity

Arrogance: About a week ago, a Spanish-language station in Miami, featured news of Martinez's arrest, friends and fans on social media  began praising him

Their Cold War animosity means Cuba and the United States
have no extradition agreement or law enforcement cooperation
treaty, although that could change once diplomatic relations are
restored.

Despite their differences, the two countries have for long
cooperated on immigration issues and drug trafficking. But
building closer law enforcement ties would still be a huge step
in Cuba's one-party system, where the police and the military
are under the control of the ruling Communist Party.

The most prominent political fugitive in Cuba is Joanne
Chesimard who escaped a New Jersey state prison following her
life sentence conviction for killing a state trooper in 1973.

But there are a host of others wanted for financial crimes.

Since 2007, U.S. authorities have been cracking down on
Medicare fraud, arresting and charging about 2,000 people who
collectively have falsely billed more than $6 billion to the
government health program for the elderly and disabled.

Most arrests were made in south Florida, often involving 
Cuban immigrants.

'They have got it down to a science ... When they get caught
they know they can skip bail and get away to Cuba. It's their
business model,' said Carlos Fleites, the lawyer for Martinez's
girlfriend, Yuleidys Gonzalez Amaral, who is charged in the same
credit card fraud case.

Fleites said the scale of the problem is hard for Cuba to
ignore.

'They have to cooperate somewhat if they want to have a
normal relationship. They know where everybody is on the island.
They could round up everyone overnight and fill a plane and have
them in Miami in the morning. Hopefully judgment day is coming.'

The FBI provided Reuters with a list of 64 south Florida
Medicare fugitives, all but six from Cuba, though the number
could be higher as some investigations may be under seal.

Among them is Jorge Emilio Perez de Morales, wanted on
charges he laundered $238 million stolen from Medicare.

Three brothers - Carlos, Jose and Luis Benitez - are accused
of running 11 Miami-Dade county clinics that swindled $110
million from Medicare.

South Florida judges are increasingly taking a harder line
on fraud involving recently arrived Cubans, refusing bond and
imposing tough jail sentences.

Last week, federal Judge Federico Moreno ordered Gonzalez
Amaral jailed after she appeared in court on bond to change her
plea to guilty and offered to cooperate with prosecutors.

'There are too many people who have fled,' Moreno said.

Lavish lifestyle: Martinez built a large, white house with pool and hot tub, marble floors, and wraparound porch — then walled it off from neighbors

Breaking the rules: Martinez's mistake is that he lived too openly and too ostentatiously for a communist state

Out of time: In the past, Cuban-born criminals escaped to the island with their riches, well out of reach of American authorities - but now the past is catching up to Martinez
