Lives will be put at risk if the Government pushes ahead with controversial plans to force emergency services to share airwaves with the public, it was claimed last night.

Ministers want to put calls by the emergency services on commercial mobile phone networks, with Vodafone and Motorola invited to tender for the new super-fast 4G system.

The Home Office insists 999 crews will have priority over other phone users on the system, which replaces its taxpayer-built Airwaves network for fire, police and ambulance crews in 2016.

Officials say emergency workers will receive faster internet connections to download data available using the latest smartphones.

But critics are concerned that moving the emergency services on to the commercial network – largely untested in major emergencies – increases the risk of call blackouts.

They say that during the 2011 riots and the London bombings in 2005, mobile services across the capital crashed under the sheer volume of use. Currently, emergency services have their own masts so even when commercial networks collapse their calls can continue.

Inspector Alan Ogg, of the Police Federation, which represents rank-and-file officers, said: ‘There are two major issues which are still of concern.

'How the transition to the new network will take place and be managed, and what provision has been made to ensure the emergency services are prioritised during periods of heavy user traffic and events.

‘Public and officer safety must remain the priority for any advancements and changes to the emergency service network.’

A West Yorkshire Fire and Rescue Service briefing paper said: ‘The capacity of a commercial network, particularly if an incident occurred during a large event, is a concern… Question marks still exist over the technological solution.

‘There are significant health and safety implications. Delivery of a solution that simply results in lower cost for Government without fully considering the effectiveness and ongoing efficiency for individual services could have significant implications for public and fire-fighter safety.’

The Home Office insists the consortium which wins the contract, worth more than £400million a year, will be ordered to prioritise the police, fire and ambulance services in an emergency.

Declan Ganley, chief executive of Rivada Networks, whose firm was not shortlisted by the Home Office, said: ‘People’s lives will be put at risk by the Government’s plan to put calls by the emergency services on commercial mobile phone networks.

‘The system simply cannot cope with a major incident.’

A Home Office spokesman said the plan remains on track and ‘the tendering process marks another step towards the emergency services having the modern communications network they need to protect the public’.
