As any woman with a generous bosom will tell you, there are certain items of clothing you don’t even bother trying on.

For large busted women like Katie Price, a bra can make or break an outfit

Strapless dresses are definitely in the no-go camp. On the hanger they might promise summer glamour, but on anyone over a D-cup they’d almost certainly end up making the bust look saggy and wobbly, instead of pert and firm.

The key issue is getting the right support. And this is where better-endowed women have been let down — because, until recently, strapless bras just haven’t been up to the task.

Certainly, as a girl with an E-cup, the few times I’ve braved a strapless bra it’s been an unmitigated disaster.

By far the worst embarrassment was at a ball as a top-heavy teen. The pesky thing offered such little support it started slipping down inside my strapless prom dress as I bopped away.

When it made it to my stomach, I was forced to sidle off to the loos, whip it off and  abandon it. When you are wearing something so big it resembles Biggles’ flying helmet, there’s no way it’s going to fit in your tiny evening bag.

My only experience as a bridesmaid was just as torturous. The beautiful mauve dress had a bustier top and this time I chose a strapless contraption that was so tight, my décolletage was flattened completely. I walked down the aisle cursing my unsightly mono boob.

Ever since, I’ve avoided dresses that require secret scaffolding.

offered such little support it started slipping down inside my strapless
 prom dress. When it made it to my stomach, I was forced to abandon it

But finally there might be hope for women like me. This summer, several new strapless bras have been launched in bigger cup sizes to rescue us busty ladies.

Charlotte Elliston, buyer for upmarket lingerie retailer Rigby & Peller, says fit is vital.

‘The many common mistakes women make when purchasing a bra are all the more obvious when wearing a strapless garment,’ she says. ‘Most incorrectly-fitted women rely on the bra straps for support, but the majority of support in a bra should come from the back band, which should be a firm fit to the body.’

Charlotte explains this may mean going down a back size to ensure a snugger fit. The underwire, meanwhile, should sit just beneath the bust rather than on the rib cage, without pressing on any breast tissue. The right size cup will encase the breasts at the side and sit flatly against the chest at the front.

With her advice in mind I put the best of the High Street strapless bras to the test, rating each one for fit and staying power — and how well they performed when it came to the all-important issue of sagging.

Wonderbra Ultimate Strapless Lace Up to a  G-Cup Bra £36, Wonderbra.co.uk

This new Wonderbra has hand-shaped padding at the side to lift and support. It sits quite low on the chest, but pushes the boobs up well for just the right amount of cleavage. Firm hold thanks to the underwiring, moulded cups and silicone strips on the back band. To start with my breasts escaped from the cups, but once I’d got the positioning right, it gave great lift and shape.

Fit: 4.5/5

Staying power: 5/5 

Sag factor: LOW

Chantelle C Essential Bra £44, harrods.com

I
 needed help to do this up; it has three hooks at the back and the 
underwiring is very stiff. It sat lower than some beneath my boobs, so 
pressed on my ribs a little. The cups were intended to envelop the 
entire breast, but I was still spilling out a little at the top. A good 
hold and a smooth line, but not the best lift.

Fit: 3.5/5

Staying power: 4/5

Sag factor: LOW TO MEDIUM

All-Around Bandeau £59, spanx.com

A
 comfier alternative to an underwire, though you have to be a 
contortionist to get it on. Comes in four sizes, Small to Extra Large, 
and claims to offer support, a sleek fit and to trim the torso. 
Unfortunately the stretchy fabric pressed down on my breasts instead of 
lifting them, giving them a bit of a ski slope. Although it was comfy, 
it didn’t give enough support or pertness.

Fit: 3.5/5

Staying power: 3/5

Sag factor: MEDIUM

Black Ultimate Longline Body Solutions Strapless  A-E Bra £22.50, marksandspencer.com

The longer line gives this bra a glamorous look without creating too much wobbly cleavage. It has four hooks at the back, so I needed help to get into it, but it felt secure, held well and is available up to an E cup in three colours – black, white and a sugary pink. My only gripe was that the underwire comes up slightly too high at the side so it pressed a little on my breast tissue there. Great shape though. Some va va voom and lift without looking tarty.

Fit: 4.5/5

Staying  power: 5/5

Sag factor: LOW

White Lace Five Way Convertible Strapless Bra £16, Debenhams.com

Well.
 What can I say? My cups overfloweth… In this bra, which does up at the 
side and has a clear back strap so it can be worn under backless 
dresses, I had cleavage to rival Dolly Parton’s and although my husband 
liked it, I felt terribly exposed.

When I put on the dress, the top 
of my breasts got squashed giving me that dreaded ‘double boob’ look. 
The clear strap, meanwhile, looked like Sellotape. The bra generally 
felt too loose and started to slip down after a while. It only goes up 
to a DD — clearly not big enough to contain us busty girls.

Fit: 3/5 

Staying power: 3/5 

Sag factor: MEDIUM

Low Back Strapless Bra Ultimo £35, ultimo.co.uk

If
 it’s sexy cleavage you’re after, then this bra is for you. There was so
 much lift, I couldn’t see my shoes. The moulded design has optional gel
 pads that slip into the cup to boost your bust even further, but on me 
this caused side overspill.

The downside is it only goes up to a DD. 
This just about fitted me but there are other strapless styles catering 
up to a G cup. Would be great under a halterneck low-back dress if you 
want to show off your biggest assets but while it did lift and separate 
excellently and gave a firm hold, the barmaid look is not for me.

Fit: 4/5

Staying power: 4.5/5 

Sag factor: LOW

Perle Moulded Strapless Bra by Prima Donna, £81.95, rigbyandpeller.com

This
 bra gives a lovely rounded shape and a reasonable lift that feels age 
appropriate. As a mother of three, these days, I don’t want to spill out
 over the top like Jessica Rabbit. It’s very comfortable and feels 
secure under the dress. Available in sizes up to a G cup in three 
colours (black, nude and white) this bra can be worn with straps, too, 
so it’s versatile. The downside is that it’s pricey, but the great fit 
makes it a worthwhile summer investment.

Fit: 5/5

Staying power: 5/5 

Sag factor: LOW

Fashion Forms Go Bare Backless Strapless Push Up bra,£28, figleaves.com

This
 self-adhesive bra is available up to a DD cup, which surely defies 
gravity. The first time I tried, the bra wasn’t straight so I had to 
peel myself out and reposition. There was some lift but the cups gaped 
and the side wings started to unstick. I feared that Carry On Camping 
scene when Barbara Windsor’s bra pings off. Would be less perilous for 
the smaller busted, not one for the well-endowed.

Fit: 2/5

Staying power: 2/5

Sag factor: MEDIUM
