Two of the nation's most well-known Islamic extremists have made it clear that Australian diggers are in their crosshairs, with one saying he could not wait to 'see an Australian soldier crying'.

Australian jihadists Mohamed Elomar and Khaled Sharrouf have made new threats on social media - this time levelled at military personnel in Iraq, the Sydney Morning Herald reported.

It comes after the Federal Government expressed concern over the growing number of Australians travelling to Iraq to join Islamic extremist groups.

Former Sydney boxer Mohamed Elomar, who allies himself with the Islamic State, tweeted a picture of an Iraqi soldier who had been taken hostage and beaten before he was executed. The Islamic State is a breakaway group of al-Qaeda.

Khaled Sharrouf responded to the tweets by saying: 'Allah...says "kill them where ever you find them".'

Alongside the photo, Elomar wrote: 'Look at the end of these Iraqi maliki dogs bunch of girls can't wait to see a Australia soldier cyring [sic] saying bakia.'

The Sydney Morning Herald reported that 'bakia' meant 'he cries' in Arabic and 'maliki' was a term used to describes the Nouri al-Maliki government, which is led by Shiites. The regime is strongly opposed to Sunni extremists who have torn through Iraq's north in the past few weeks.

In response to Elomar's outburst, Sharrouf - who is also part of the Islamic State - tweeted: 'Allah...says "kill them where ever you find them"....'

These threats come just days after the Australian Government said almost 60 Australians fight for Islamic radicals in Iraq and Syria

These threats come just days after the Australian Government said almost 60 Australians fight for Islamic radicals in Iraq and Syria, while about 150 Australians were being monitored for supporting terrorist organisations, recruiting fighters or preparing to travel overseas to fight.

This information was revealed after Sydney teenager Abdullah Elmir became the third Australian teenager to walk out on his family in June bound for Iraq.

It is believed Abdullah, 17, was recruited by an Islamic extremist group to fight in the troubled war zone.

He went missing from his family's Bankstown home - in Western Sydney - almost two weeks ago, and has only been heard from once when he contacted his mother to say he was in Turkey.
