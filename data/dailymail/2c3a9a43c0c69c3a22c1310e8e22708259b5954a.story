World Cup winner Lukas Podolski never hides away from being a Cologne fan; and now he has his own page in BILD on the subject.

The striker has written a heartfelt letter about the club he left for Arsenal in 2012, who will be back in the Bundesliga this season.

Podolski says the atmosphere at the ground is unlike anything he has ever experienced (coming from a World Cup winner), and that the club 'owns his heart'.

Hometown boy: Podolski is a big fan of his former club, who were promoted to the Bundesliga last season

'We need to establish in the Bundesliga and permanently stay in the top. Because this club and this city are simply the best in the German league,' he writes, translated by Sport Witness. '

'Not to mention the fans - as good a mood and atmosphere as in Cologne, I have never experienced in all my international matches and Champions League appearances.

'When I was finally back on the ground, I felt the typical Cologne euphoria, joy, and the hunger of the people for the Bundesliga. We all want to see FC there permanently.

'My attitude towards the club has never changed since the youth. It is the club that owns my whole heart. And I wish coaching staff, team, club and especially the fans good luck and to have a big season.
