The ex-girlfriend of Dallas Cowboys running back Joseph Randle has asked a judge for a protective order against him after claiming he pointed a gun at her friend in front of their young son.

Dalia Jacobs called 911 from a hotel in Wichita on Tuesday to report that her ex was 'out of control' and the following day, she filed a petition for a protective order in Sedgwick County, Kansas.

In the petition, she explained that ahead of the 911 call, Randle had become angry with her in front of their son, Daniel, walked to his car, retrieved a handgun and pointed it at her friend.

'He told me at this point that he was going to "blast the vehicle",' Jacobs wrote in the filing seen by the Dallas News - but instead he allegedly smashed the car window with his fist.

Accusations: Joseph Randle of the Dallas Cowboys became angry and violent during a recent argument with his ex-girlfriend in front of their son, she has claimed in a court petition

'Glass splatters everywhere,' Jacobs told KWCH as she became tearful as she recounted the fight. 

'There's glass in my son's hair. It hit him and that's when he starts crying. I just grab my son and I'm like, "I hope you're okay baby". I thought he got cut or something.'

In the filing, she added: 'The defendant has a violent temper and gets angry quickly... [he] has a history of being both physically and emotionally abusive towards me.'

She told KWCH that the incident came after Randle has repeatedly failed to pay child support.

Wichita Police did not find a weapon inside Randle's hotel room when they arrived, but suggested that another person might have left with it.

But they did find 'a small amount of green botanical substance' in the hotel room and initially charged the football player with unlawful possession of a controlled substance.

But the charges have now been dropped because police received 'inconsistent stories', Police Lieutenant James Espinoza told the Dallas News - but the investigation is not over.

Anger: Jacobs, pictured with her ex-boyfriend, has also accused him of failing to pay child support 

Scene: Police were called to their hotel, pictured, on Tuesday but officers did not find a gun. He was cited for having a controlled substance but the charges have since been dropped

'We're still actively investigating this incident. We take domestic violence very serious,' Espinoza said. 'We want to have time to put all the facts together and to present it to the DA's office for all the charges that could be filed.' 

On Thursday, Randle tweeted that he's 'learning the value of a good lawyer each day' before adding that he should watch out for the company he keeps - but this was later deleted.

Randle's agent, Erik Burkhardt, said that Randle had not been arrested but was merely given a ticket before officers left, the Dallas News reported.

'There was zero 'violence' of any kind, domestic or otherwise. He was asking 3 ppl to exit his room, who didn't want to leave,' he wrote online. 'There was zero 'violence' of any kind, domestic or otherwise. He was asking 3 ppl to exit his room, who didn't want to leave.'

A hearing for the protective order is scheduled for February 19.
