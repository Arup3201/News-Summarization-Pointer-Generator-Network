At least 69 people were killed and more than 190 wounded in a wave of co-ordinated bombings across Baghdad yesterday, days after U.S. forces finally left.

The 16 blasts were immediately blamed on Al Qaeda in Iraq because of the sheer scale of the operation and the expertise involved.

A variety of bombing techniques were used in 11 neighbourhoods. There was one suicide bomber, two vehicles packed with explosives, some roadside bombs and other so-called ‘sticky’ bombs underneath cars.

Security spokesman Major General Qassim Atta said the bombers targeted schools, workers and an anti-corruption agency. ‘They were not security targets,’ he said. One blast killed seven people as they helped the victims of a previous explosion.

The carnage – the worst to hit Baghdad in months – came after the last American troops left Iraq last Sunday, nearly nine years after the invasion that toppled Saddam Hussein. Many Iraqis had feared a return to sectarian violence without a U.S. military buffer.

Iraq’s fragile power-sharing government is grappling with its worst turmoil since its formation a year ago. Shi’ite, Sunni and Kurdish blocs share out government posts in a unwieldy system that has been impaired by political infighting since it began.

This week Prime Minister Nuri al-Maliki moved to sideline two Sunni Muslim leaders, stirring tensions.

Al Qaeda is mainly Sunni and security officials believe insurgents had been waiting for a worsening sectarian relationship to unleash attacks.

Most appeared to hit Shi’ite neighbourhoods, although some Sunni areas were also targeted.

British Foreign Secretary William Hague condemned the attacks as 'cowardly'. He has urged leaders to 'pull together' in the wake of the blasts to aid the country's political stability.

He said: 'I condemn the attacks that took place in Baghdad this morning, resulting in the death and injury of a large number of people. I offer my condolences to the bereaved and injured. These cowardly attacks come at a time of political tension in Iraq.

'I hope that leaders from across the political and sectarian spectrum will pull together to establish a dialogue to ensure Iraq's political stability and to build a stable future. The UK will support Iraq in its efforts to defeat extremism and terrorism.'

Iraqi officials said at least 14 blasts went off early this morning in 11 neighbourhoods around the city. The violence ranged from sticky bombs attached to cars to roadside bombs and vehicles packed with explosives.

In the southwestern neighbourhood of Karrada, where one of the victims was killed, sirens could be heard as ambulances rushed to the scene and a large plume of smoke rose over the explosion site.

Um Hanin, in western Baghdad, said: 'My baby was sleeping in her bed. Shards of glass have fallen on our heads. Her father hugged her and carried her. She is now scared in the next room. All countries are stable. Why don't we have security and stability?'

While Baghdad and Iraq have become much safer over the years, explosions like today's are still commonplace.

They come at a precarious time in Iraq's political history, just days after American troops pulled out of Iraq.

The government of Prime Minister Nouri al-Maliki has accused the Sunni Vice President Tariq al-Hashemi of running a hit squad that targeted government officials. Al-Maliki is also pushing for a vote of no-confidence against another Sunni politician, the deputy prime minister Saleh al-Mutlaq.

Many Sunnis fear that this is part of a wider campaign to go after Sunni political figures in general and shore up Shiite control across the country at a critical time when all American troops have left Iraq.

There was no immediate claim of responsibility for the morning's violence. But the coordinated nature of the assault and the fact that the attacks took place in numerous neighbourhoods suggested a planning capability only available to Al Qaeda in Iraq.

Many of the neighbourhoods were also Shiite areas which are a favourite target of the terrorist organisation. The Sunni extremist group often targets Shiites who they believe are not true Muslims.

Al Qaeda in Iraq is severely debilitated from its previous strength in the early years of the war, but is still able to launch coordinated and deadly assaults from time to time.

U.S. military officials have said they are worried about a resurgence of the group after the American military leaves the country.

If that happens, it could lead Shiite militants to fight back and attack Sunni targets, thus sending Iraq back to the sectarian violence it experienced just a few years ago.
