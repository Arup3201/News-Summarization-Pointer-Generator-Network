Chelsea youngster Islam Feruz is set for a season-long loan move to FC Kryli Sovetov.

The 18-year-old, who is highly rated at Stamford Bridge, is expected to complete a move to Russia today.

Feruz, who is a Scotland Under-21 international, signed a new long-term deal with the Blues in January.

Talented: Islam Feruz in action during the NextGen series match between Chelsea U19 and Ajax U19 in Aldershot 

Experience: Jose Mourinho wanted the forward to experience senior football 

But the club want him to get a season of senior football under his belt before considering him for the first-team.

Feruz is yet to make his senior bow for the Blues but has featured in various pre-season matches.

Loan list: Lucas Piazon (left) has spent the last three seasons out on loan, and Christian Atsu (right) was loaned out to Everton for this season 

Experienced: Neither Victor Moses (left, on loan at Liverpool last season) or Ryan Bertrand (right) have managed to break into Mourinho's first team

Cardiff City, Reading, Brighton and Derby had shown interest in the Somalia-born teenager before the youngster opted for the Russian side.

Chelsea list of players out on loan now increases to eighteen.
