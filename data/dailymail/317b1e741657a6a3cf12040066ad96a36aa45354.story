Thirty per cent of online posts which are deemed inappropriate on China's equivalent of Twitter are deleted within half an hour, according to new research. 

Computer scientists Jed Crandall and Dan Wallach conducted the study on how quickly censorship on Sina Weibo can work. 

They found that some posts are deleted as quickly as five minutes after being put online.

Censorship: Computer scientists Jed Crandall and Dan Wallach found that some posts are deleted after five minutes of being posted

Microblogging site Sina Weibo launched in 2010 but it now has 300 million users. 

About 100 million messages are sent daily.

But the Chinese government seems to ask Chinese companies to censor posts.

The researchers said: 'We found that deletions happen most heavily in the first hour after a post has been submitted. 

'Focusing on original posts, not reposts/retweets, we observed that nearly 30 per cent of the total deletion events occur within five to 30 minutes.

'Nearly 90 per cent of the deletions happen within the first 24 hours. 

'Leveraging out data, we also consider a variety of hypotheses about the mechanisms used by Weibo for censorship, such as the extent to which they use retrospective keyword-based censorship, and how repost/retweet popularity interacts with censorship.

'We also perform a topical analysis of the deleted posts, overcoming the usage of neologisms, named entities, and informal language that typifies Chinese social media.'

Crandall and Wallach spent 30 days tracking posts by 3,500 users on Sina Weibo. 

During that time, 300 of the accounts, or 12 percent of the total, were deleted.

Accounts that got censored the most often also had posts censored the most quickly, showing that they might be the target of more scrutiny.

Though they could not estimate the exact number of people dedicated to deleting posts on Sina Weibo, the two computer scientists said that the company would need to employ at least 4,000 censors every day if none of the process was automated.

In December last year the ruling Communist arty, led Xi Jinping, announced moves to force internet users to fully identify themselves to service providers, raising fresh concerns about freedom of speech in the country.

It's draconian internet censorship system has been dubbed the 'Great Firewall of China'.

China already heavily restricts access to many foreign sites.

It blocks Twitter, Facebook, YouTube and many other websites citing a need to maintain social stability.
