A 91-year-old war veteran who smothered his ailing wife to end her suffering has been released from prison early after serving six months. 

Robert Shaw was sentenced to four years behind bars last June after pleading guilty to involuntary manslaughter as part of a plea deal in the death of his wife of 65 years, Virginia, in 2008.

On Tuesday, Lorain County Judge Mark Betleski granted him early release for good behavior and the grandfather left Pickaway Correctional Institution in Orient, Ohio.

'There was no question in my mind as I'm going through the process that this was a man who made a tortured decision,' Betleski told NewsNet5 after the hearing.

Freed: 91-year-old Robert Shaw, pictured in court last summer, has been released from prison in Ohio after serving six months behind bars for smothering his ailing wife of 65 years to end her suffering

Shaw, who has been in poor health himself, will be on probation for two years after his release and will live with family members, his defense attorney Kenneth Lieux said at the hearing, the Chronicle-Telegram reported. The family had requested for him to be released, he said.

Shaw, who struggled to hear the court hearing as he appeared via video link, had been eligible for release after serving six months as part of last year's plea deal.

Lieux added that Shaw, who had never been in trouble with the law before the killing, has not had any infractions in prison and even worked a job behind bars.

He was initially charged with aggravated murder, murder and felonious assault for the killing because mercy killings are illegal in Ohio.

Euthanasia is illegal in the US but a handful of states - Oregon, Vermont, Washington and Montana - do allow physician-assisted suicide in some instances.

'The law is black and white, but we’re all humans,' the judge added to NewsNet5.

Shaw, who fought at the Battle of the Bulge in Europe and was retired from a job in truck manufacturing, smothered his 84-year-old wife, Virginia, as she lay in bed on November 13, 2008.

He then phoned a 911 operator and said: 'I just killed my wife.' 

Scene: He used a towel to smother his wife Virginia at their Avon, Ohio home (pictured) in 2008 after she had spent the previous few months in and out of hospital. He then called 911 to report what he had done

On the recording, Shaw can be heard saying he wanted 'to put her out of her misery'.

He went on: 'She had been in and out of the hospital and came home a couple of months ago, and... uh... I can't talk ...'

Police arrived through an unlocked door to find Shaw sitting at a table. He told officers that they could find his wife in the bedroom.

The Lorain County Coroner said she appeared to die by asphyxiation. 

At the hearing on Tuesday, Assistant County Prosecutor Chris Pierre warned that Shaw could pose a risk to the community.

'I hope the defendant understands he does not have the right to decide when to end someone's life,' he told the judge.
