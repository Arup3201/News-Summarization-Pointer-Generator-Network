Brendan Rodgers has brought Mario Balotelli crashing back down to earth with a warning he must improve his work rate to become a success at Anfield.

Liverpool's manager yesterday clarified the controversy around Balotelli's spot-kick against Besiktas, insisting the Italy striker was justified in taking the responsibility off Jordan Henderson as he is No 2 penalty taker to Steven Gerrard, who was not on the pitch.

Rodgers was unhappy with the bickering that took place after the penalty had been awarded but of far greater concern to him was the way Balotelli played after he had given Liverpool a lead to take to Istanbul.

Balotelli has scored just four goals in 22 games for Liverpool so far this season

The 24-year-old has garnered a reputation throughout his career for poor discipline and attitude

This was the former Manchester City player's third big contribution in 10 days, following his goal against Tottenham that secured three points and a free-kick that created Adam Lallana's winner at Crystal Palace. But Rodgers is still looking for much more from his £16 million summer signing.

Balotelli has been the subject of public criticism from Rodgers before, notably on Boxing Day when he explained that the 24-year-old's qualities did not fit Liverpool's system.

When asked if he had been happy with Balotelli's cameo against Besiktas, Rodgers replied: 'No. Not really. No. We need to ensure that we have everyone working as a team and once we got the penalty he stops working.

'He needs to improve on that facet of his game — to play in his position rather than standing on the side of the football field. He has contributed. He has got the penalty and scored the goal but that is what he is paid to do.

'So he needs to keep that efficiency in his game and show that he can affect the team whether he is asked to play from the bench or from the start. If he works harder than when he came on, he will (become an influence).'

When all is said and done though, Balotelli does have a very good penalty taking record

One of the main qualities Rodgers looks for in a forward is an ability to relentlessly press and put opponents on the back foot.

'In a different country and a different style of football (scoring goals) would be all that matters,' said Rodgers. 'But in this team it is more than that.'

Balotelli was roundly condemned for his behaviour before Thursday night's winning spot-kick and former Liverpool midfielder and Sportsmail columnist Jamie Redknapp believes the Italian is coming to the end of his time at Anfield.

He said: 'The problem with Mario is I don't think he has got a lot of respect for anybody.

'He has worked with some of the best managers in Cesare Prandelli, Jose Mourinho, Roberto Mancini — everybody has tried with this man but nobody seems to get to the bottom of it.

'The objective is to put the ball into the back of the net, thankfully that is what he did, but it is not nice to see players arguing like that on the field.

'He is an incredibly confident penalty taker and very good at it, but it is that lack of respect that he has.'

Balotelli has been prone to high-profile controversies at all of his former clubs  

Explaining the penalty situation, Rodgers continued: 'Steven and Mario are the top two penalty takers, but neither of them were on the pitch at the start so Jordan was nominated.

'But when we had a penalty Mario had come on to the field so Jordan, being someone with responsibility and trust, gave the penalty to Mario so there was no issue. There was a little bit of a kerfuffle around it because he wanted to make sure Mario was happy to take it, but that was it really.

'If you are the vice-captain and the captain is on the bench and then he comes on, it is the etiquette to give him the armband. It is a similar thing with the penalty.

'Mario has scored nearly 30 penalties in big games and he is an outstanding penalty taker. Jordan was happy enough to take it, but he gave it to Mario. There is no drama.'

Rodgers, whose side travel to Southampton tomorrow, stressed that no decision has been made about whether Henderson will take over the captaincy when Gerrard eventually moves to LA Galaxy.

'Jordan showed what a team player he is,' said Rodgers. 'People see him as that automatic next captain but that's not necessarily the case. People are trying to catapult him into the next Steven Gerrard but he is a totally different player. He is working his role very well.'

Jordan Henderson has been praised by his manager as a 'team player' after Liverpool's win over Besiktas
