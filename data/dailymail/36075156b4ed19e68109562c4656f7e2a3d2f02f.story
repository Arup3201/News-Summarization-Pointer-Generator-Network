She may only have given birth for the first time four months ago but Billie Faiers already prides herself as an expert when it comes to motherhood.

She's channelling her knowledge of all things babies into designing a range of buggies for My Babiie - and says the feedback from fellow mothers has been overwhelming. 

'I wanted to create something that I was proud of and  something that I wanted to use,' she told MailOnline of the new range.

'I have had lots of positive feedback on social media - so many people are tweeting saying how much they love the range and showing pictures of their babies in the prams. Everyone has been so positive.'

Super svelte: Billie Faiers only had a baby four months ago but she's snapped back into her pre-pregnancy body and is busy promoting her new pushchair range 

'The Signature Range’ by Billie Faiers includes a set of three exclusive pushchairs, costing £79.99 and £100.

Billie explains that she has worked hard with the team  to create the products that reflect her personality and her passion for cutting-edge design.

'When I was shopping for Nelly's arrival I couldn't believe how expensive everything was,' she said.

'At first I thought the most expensive items were the best but I soon realised this wasn't the case and the best bits I got for her were actually the most affordable items.'

Ready for another: She and fiancé Greg Shepherd are loving parenthood so much that they're already thinking about baby number two and Billie loves how close in age she and sister Sam are

The 24-year-old has taken to motherhood like a duck to water - and it seems she's mastered the secret to parenthood.

'Motherhood isn't that different to what I expected; it’s more about the organisation and learning the routine,' she said. 

'Nelly is a good baby and she does sleep through the night, sometimes she wakes up but not a lot. It’s all about routine.'

While she showcases a svelte post-baby physique in the campaign imagery, Billie claims she hasn't been working out. 

'Nelly and I have just been enjoying time together. I've had no time to go back in the gym but I’m always on my feet because I’m so busy,' she said.

She and fiancé Greg Shepherd are loving parenthood so much that they're already thinking about baby number two - and she won't let work get in the way of her time with Nelly.

Speaking about adding to the brood, she said: 'Probably not just yet, maybe in the next year. I love how close Sam and I are so I’d like them to be close in age.

'Nelly’s the priority to Greg and I. We’re a family now and it’s going to be family first.'

Billie may have made her fortunes by playing out her life on TV but she wouldn't push her children to follow in her footsteps.

She added:: 'I wouldn't  necessarily encourage her but if she wanted to do something like that then of course I’d be happy.'

Trim: Billie says she hasn't had time to work out and has instead been focussing on spending time with her newborn
