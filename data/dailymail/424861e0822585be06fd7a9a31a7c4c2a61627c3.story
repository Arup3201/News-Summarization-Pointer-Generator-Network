A North Carolina mother was arrested last week after allegedly assisting her 16-year-old son as he set himself on fire.

Questionable mothering? Janie Lachelle Talley, 41, was arrested last week for allegedly filming her son as he lit himself on fire as part of the internet 'fire challenge' craze

Janie Talley, 41, has been charged with contributing to the delinquency of a juvenile after police say she filmed her son as he doused himself in fingernail polish remover July 29 as part of the viral 'fire challenge' online video craze.

The boy sustained minor burns on his chest and neck as other people watching his stunt-gone-wrong managed to tamp out the flames.

'[Talley] 
was present and aware of what her son (was) doing and facilitated the 
recording,' police said in a statement that went out following Talley's 
Wednesday arrest.

It
 was the culmination of a days-long investigation that began when social
 services officials were tipped off about the video, which was posted to
 Facebook despite the boy's injuries.

Police then watched the video for themselves, which eventually led to Talley's arrest, reports the Charlotte Observer.

Her trial was scheduled for October 2.

Meanwhile,
 several teens attempting the fire challenge across the country have 
been burned just like the 16-year-old in this case.

A
 Kentucky 15-year-old doused himself in rubbing alcohol and suffered 
serious second degree burns across his torso in late July after putting a
 flame to it.

Just
 this month, a California 16-year-old named Fernando Valencia set 
himself ablaze and suffered third degree burns which were deemed likely 
to require skin grafts.Â 

Fire Challenge: In the dangerous stunt, people douse themselves in flammable liquid and take video of themselves lighting it on fire. It is unclear if this example--widely distributed the same day of Janie Talley's son's stunt--is the video in question in the 41-year-old mother's case

Facebook
 has said they intend to remove such videos as they appear, but several 
such 'fire challenge' videos remain readily viewable on YouTube.

In
 one particularly disturbing example that went viral the same day of Talley's alleged crime, a young man screams in pain and 
fear as his torso goes up in a sheet of flames along with his 
acetone-soaks sweatpants.

The camera continues to roll as some people watching the stunt manage to tamp out the flames and remove the burning trousers.

The shocking stunt has gained nearly a million views on YouTube.

Terrifying: The person in this video, which has gained nearly a million views on YouTube alone, screams in fear and pain as his torso is enveloped in a sheath of fire. Some others watching the stunt helped tamp out the flames and remove the stuntman's burning trousers
