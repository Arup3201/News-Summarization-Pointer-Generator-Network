After being subjected to homophobic taunts from colleagues and eventually sacked from his job simply for being gay, this animal lover found solace in the sprawling llama sanctuary he set up on his Kentucky estate.

But now the future of Kevin McCaffery's farm could be under threat after his law suit against the day care centre that forced him to quit failed - because Kentucky has no law banning anti-gay discrimination in the workplace.

Mr McCaffery, who was constantly referred to as 'twinkle toes' by colleagues at the centre in Ashland, is struggling to fund the upkeep of LLA-Nanny Farms - where he cares for rescued cats and dogs, chickens, donkeys and pigs as well as llamas - because of mounting bills and legal costs.

Kentucky is one of more than 30 U.S. states where it is not illegal to fire an employee because they are gay, bisexual or transgender.

Former teacher Mr McCaffery, who has been out of paying work for more than a year, now fears he won't be able to feed his hundreds of animals for much longer, a report on Buzzfeed.com said.

Having already resorted to using cheaper feed for his menagerie - which includes 51 llamas and more than 300 animals in total - the farmer has now said he is 'running out of options'. Mr McCaffery is living on food stamps and his attempts to secure a new job have so far been unsuccessful.

'It's hard to keep my head up anymore,' he said on Facebook.

But hope is on the horizon after one woman touched by Mr McCaffery's story set up a fundraising page people can use to donate money to help pay for the animals' food.

The LLA-Nanny Farms Food Trough page was set up at the weekend with a target of raising $1,800. Donations have already topped $8,000.

Mr McCaffery taught in public schools for 15 years before retiring to focus on his farm. When he decided to return to work a few years ago and took up a post as the director of the day care centre in Ashland, he found himself the target of jibes about his sexuality from co-workers.

The centre eventually forced him to resign in spite of his spotless record. Mr McCaffery said a judge agreed he had been treated unfairly, but his attempt to win compensation failed as Kentucky does not have state law in place regarding homophobic discrimination at work.

Activists are calling for the Employment Non-Discrimination Act (ENDA) to protect LGBT individuals in the workplace and prevent people finding themselves in situations like that now faced by Mr McCaffery.

The bill was previously introduced in 2011, but is yet to be made law despite widespread popular support.

It's sponsors are pushing for a new vote in the Senate and simultaneously lobbying President Obama to take executive action barring discrimination.
