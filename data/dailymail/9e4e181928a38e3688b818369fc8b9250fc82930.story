A mother who was preparing dinner for her children was horrified after finding hundreds of black bugs crawling inside a packet of pasta she had just bought.

Hayley O’Shea, 39, began pouring out fusilli from Tesco to make a tuna pasta bake for her daughters Maisie, seven and Amelia, five, when she saw the infestation of weevils.

The mother-of-two quickly threw the Cook Italian brand pasta and the bugs in the bin and sealed up the bag that had not been opened before.

Upset: Maisie O'Shea, seven, and her sister Amelia, five, at their home in Bournemouth, Dorset holding the pasta which contained weevil bugs

She has no idea how the swarm of the beetle-type bug got into the 500g bag.

Mrs O’Shea called Tesco to complain and was at first told someone would come and collect the packet from her home in Bournemouth, Dorset, so they could investigate.

When nobody arrived she emailed the supermarket giant again but was then told she would have to return it to a store.

Mrs O’Shea, an account manager at a marketing company, said she is concerned that other bags of pasta could contain the bugs.

Mrs O’Shea said: 'I bought the pasta from the Tesco online shopping service.

Infested: Some of the Weevils found in the Italian fusilli pasta from Tesco which was bought online

Shocked: Mother-of-two Hayley O¿Shea, 39 was about to cook a tuna pasta bake when she noticed the bugs

Return: Tesco said they would pick up the contaminated package from their home, but when no one arrived, Mrs O'Shea was forced to take it into a store

A weevil is a type of beetle which is usually less than six millimetres (0.24 in) long.

There are more than 60,000 species in several families and can often be found  in dry foods including nuts and seeds, cereal and grain products, such as pancake mix.

In the domestic setting, they are most likely to be found when a bag of flour is opened.

Their presence is often indicated by the granules of the infested item sticking together in strings, as if caught in a cobweb.

'I opened it and tipped some into a pan for my children’s dinner and noticed lots of little black things.

'Initially I thought it might have been something burnt on the bottom of the pan so I drained the pasta under the tap, then I looked closer and saw they were insects.

'I looked at the rest of the packet and it was absolutely crawling with them. There must have been hundreds of the things.

'My two children were horrified and now won’t eat pasta again.

'I had no idea what they were so I looked it up on the internet and realised they were weevil bugs.

'I contacted Tesco and they said 
someone would come and collect the pasta but they didn’t turn up, so I 
emailed them and they told me that it wasn’t their policy to do so.

'They refunded me the money and gave me a 10 pounds compensation voucher but it’s not money I’m after.

'I am outraged that they didn’t want to find out where these weevils came from, it’s like they don’t care.'

A
Tesco spokeswoman said: 'If a customer finds something in their food 
that they think shouldn’t be there, we would ask them to return it to 
store as soon as possible so we can conduct a thorough investigation.'

A spokesman for Cook Italian, the company who makes the pasta, said: 'Our key desire is to reassure your readers that all our products are made to very high quality standards, so they should not be concerned that this is normal.

'Equally, though, we all have to accept that natural products attract natural issues from time to time but that said, our processes are set up to eradicate all of these which are within our control to do so.'

Swarm: One of the hundreds of bugs that were found crawling round the packet of pasta

Food: The packet of pasta which arrived at the O'Shea bugs with hundreds of weevil bugs inside
