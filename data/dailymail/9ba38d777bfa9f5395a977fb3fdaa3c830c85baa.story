Moors murderer Ian Brady made his first public appearance in decades yesterday without showing a flicker of remorse for his despicable crimes.

He described the slaughter of five children as 'petty', doctors revealed – and compared his behaviour to the acts of soldiers and politicians in war.

His cold assessment of the murders that horrified a nation emerged at a hearing to decide whether he should be released from a secure hospital and allowed to die in prison.

It is the only time 75-year-old Brady 
has been seen in public since he was jailed for life with Myra Hindley 
in 1966, save for a long-lens photograph taken in 1987 when police took 
him back to the scene of his crimes on Saddleworth Moor near Manchester.

Thus, with grotesque irony, the man 
who denied his pleading victims the right to live took centre stage to 
fight for the right to die.

He is using taxpayers' money to ask a
mental health tribunal to allow him to transfer from Ashworth Hospital,
Merseyside, where he has been on hunger strike for the past 13 years, 
so he can 'take control' of the time and manner of his death.

In a featureless room at the 
high-security hospital yesterday, doctors gave evidence to a judge and 
medical panel about whether Brady was psychotic or schizophrenic, or 
sane enough to see out his life in jail.

He sat taking almost continuous notes –
a slim, slightly hunched figure in dark glasses and a dark-coloured 
jacket, with a full head of hair, grey now, but still swept back in the 
teddy-boy style he sported in the early 1960s.

His complexion looked 
perfect on the screens that broadcast proceedings in public to the Civil
Justice Centre some 40 miles away in Manchester.

At Ashworth, Brady is fed via a tube 
and yesterday it was taped to the right side of his lip, leading to one 
nostril, the only indication of his physical condition among all the 
talk of his mental state.

Yet in rare moments when he looked up
from his foolscap pad, he still had that air of menace.

You had to 
remind yourself that somewhere in his twisted, evil mind, the chilling 
detail must still be lurking – names of every victim that he and Myra 
Hindley killed: dates, method of torture, manner of death.

Crucially, perhaps, he might even have
known the precise location where a 12-year-old boy, still missing half a
century later, was buried.

Brady and Myra Hindley murdered five 
youngsters in the 1960s.

The victims were lured to their deaths, 
sexually tortured and buried on the moors.

Brady was last photographed helping police search for the remains of two of his victims on Saddleworth Moor in 1987, but has not been seen in public since their trial in 1966

Pauline Reade, 16, vanished on her way
to a disco on July 12, 1963. John Kilbride, 12, was snatched in 
November the same year. Keith Bennett was taken on June 16, 1964 after 
he left home to visit his grandmother. Lesley Ann Downey, ten, was lured
from a funfair on Boxing Day, 1964. Edward Evans, 17, was killed in 
October 1965.

Brady was given life at Chester 
Assizes in 1966 for the murders of John, Lesley Ann and Edward. Hindley,
who died in prison in 2002 aged 60, was convicted of killing Lesley Ann
and Edward, and of shielding Brady. She was also jailed for life. In 
1987 the pair finally admitted killing Keith and Pauline.

But tribunal judge Robert Atherton 
made it clear yesterday this was not an inquiry into Brady's crimes; nor
would he be asked the whereabouts of Keith.

What quickly became apparent was that,
despite the earnest nature of the proceedings – swamped with medical 
opinion and diagnosis, and peppered with specialist terms – this was the
Ian Brady show. He has fought for years to get this platform and is 
expected to give evidence later.

Yesterday he addressed the judge only 
once, mumbling in a quiet, gravelled, voice, tinged with a Scottish 
accent. He leaned over repeatedly to whisper to his lawyer – she 
appeared at one stage to put her fingers to her lips to quieten him.

Brady did not look at the camera once 
during more than four hours but simply to appear was grandstanding 
enough. This was only the second time such a hearing has opened its 
doors to public scrutiny, and, in this case, to relatives or friends of 
the dead.

Alan Bennett, Keith's brother, watched
the hearing and afterwards accused Brady of 'attention-seeking'. On his
blog, he added: 'Brady looked fit and well which is what I expected 
after being told many times over the years that he has never been 
fitter, despite his farcical supposed “hunger strike”.'

The hearing was described as a 
'macabre game' by David Kirwan, the solicitor who represented Keith's 
mother Winnie Johnson until she died last year.

The tribunal referred to the killer 
throughout as 'Mr Brady' and heard arguments for and against suggestions
that he is mentally ill.

Dr Cameron Boyd, the medical member of the tribunal panel, said he met Brady last week.

'Asked if he wanted to die, he refused
to answer,' he said. Brady denied being psychotic and claimed he had 
only been 'acting' when displaying such symptoms. Dr Boyd said he asked 
Brady about the Moors Murders. 'He said it was an existential exercise, 
personal philosophy and interpretation and in some way his behaviour was
petty compared to politicians and soldiers in relation to wars.'

He said Brady believed the tribunal was not independent and its decision would be 'a political one'.

Dr Adrian Grounds, a forensic 
psychiatrist who examined Brady on behalf of his legal team, said 
despite his behaviour, there was no evidence he was mentally ill.

Brady claimed he had learned to copy symptoms of mental illness while working as a cleaner at Wormwood Scrubs prison, he said.

It was 'inconceivable' that he would be sent to a secure hospital were he to be assessed today.

Brady did exhibit 'delusions' and 
believed staff at Ashworth  mounted 'conspiracies' against him. But this
'paranoia' was a feature of his serious personality disorder.

As Brady displayed 'hostility and 
contempt' towards any attempt at therapy, there was no value in 
continuing to detain him at Ashworth, Dr Grounds said.

The hearing continues.
