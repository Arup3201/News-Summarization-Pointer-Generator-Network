Tottenham were sweating on the fitness of Nacer Chadli and Hugo Lloris on Tuesday after the pair picked up injuries while on international duty.

Chadli missed Belgium’s clash against Bosnia and Herzegovina on Monday with a hip complaint, and goalkeeper Lloris pulled out of France’s clash against Armenia on Tuesday night with a thigh problem.

Chadli, who is Tottenham’s top scorer this season with four goals, played in Belgium’s 6-0 win over Andorra last Friday despite worries about his hip.

Belgium’s medical team are confident the injury is not serious, but Tottenham will assess the situation before a decision on Chadli’s availability for Saturday’s clash at Manchester City.

They hope Lloris will be available after France manager Didier Deschamps said: ‘It’s going a lot better for Hugo.’

Tottenham right back Kyle Walker is targeting the clash with Chelsea on December 3 for his return from abdominal surgery. 

Defender Milos Veljkovic, 19, is joining Middlesbrough on loan until January but could stay until the end of the season.
