Lily Todd, 51, from Hartlepool, was banned from owning animals for five years at Hartlepool Magistrates, after kicking a defenceless pet rabbit around her garden, in a bizarre bid to get her daughter's attention following a row

A mother resorted to kicking a defenceless rabbit around the garden in a bid to grab her teenage daughter's attention.

Lily Todd carried out the attack on the pet after becoming embroiled in an argument with her daughter, Hartlepool Magistrates heard.

When a shocked neighbour intervened and called the RSPCA, Todd said attacking the rabbit was the only way she had of getting through to her daughter.

Despite denying the attack on the rabbit, called Twinkle, 51-year-old Todd, who also owned another rabbit and a cockatiel, was found guilty at trial and disqualified from owning animals for five years.

RSPCA officials praised magistrates for the sentence and described Todd’s attack on the animal in her garden on Sandringham Road, Hartlepool, as 'awful'.

The court heard that Todd argued with her teenage daughter at around 8.30pm on Friday, March 30 this year.

She went back inside to get the rabbit and started kicking it, while demanding her daughter went back inside the house.

The rabbit ran off and a neighbour picked it up and took it to his home, while Todd continued looking for it.

John Ellwood, prosecuting, said: 'Her neighbour gave her back the rabbit and warned her that she shouldn’t kick the rabbit.

'The defendant said that was the only way she could get her daughter in, and the only way she would listen to her.

'The neighbour said that it was not the rabbit’s fault and the defendant then picked up the rabbit and threw it at the neighbour, stating that he should just have the rabbit.'

Todd’s neighbour took the animal back and alerted the RSPCA of the attack, who then collected the rabbit and took it to the vets.

X-rays were carried out which showed that the rabbit had suffered five fractured ribs in the attack, two on the right side and three on the left

Vets described the injuries as being consistent with being kicked or thrown.

Todd was interviewed and admitted losing her temper, but denied kicking the rabbit.

She pleaded not guilty, but was found guilty of causing unnecessary suffering to a protected animal.

As well as being disqualified from owning animals for five years, Todd was given a 12- month community order with a requirement of supervision and ordered to pay £500 costs to the RSPCA.

John Relton, mitigating, said: 'My client is a 51-year-old lady of previous good character who is in poor health.

'She owned two other animals, another rabbit which was in good health and a cockatiel which was also in good health.

'This was a singular attack born out of frustration.'

Twinkle and two other pets owned by Todd have been taken into care by the RSPCA, which branded the attack 'awful'

RSPCA inspector Kristina Raine said: 'I am pleased with the conviction and the sentence passed.

'This was an awful attack on a small and defenceless animal.

'When it was x-rayed the rabbit had fractured ribs which, along with the witness statements, could not have been explained any other way.

'We are very grateful for the assistance of those witnesses who were a key part of this prosecution and we could not have done it without them.

'The RSPCA always hope for a ban on keeping animals as the best way of ensuring the safety of others in future.

'It also means we can now get the rabbit, and Todd’s other animals, into good new homes.'
