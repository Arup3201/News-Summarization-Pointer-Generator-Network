Smell: A cadaver dog reportedly detected the scent of a deceased human being in the bedroom of Lisa Irwin's parents Jeremy Irwin and Deborah Bradley

The scent was detected 'in an area of the floor of [Lisa Irwin's mother Deborah] Bradley’s bedroom near the bed,' the affidavit said.

The positive hit was used as evidence to get the search warrant for a 17-hour search on Wednesday.

Police said that they wanted to look for DNA, fingerprints, cell phones and evidence of human decomposition.

Officers today said that they removed items including a multi-coloured comforter, purples shorts, a Disney shirt, a glow warm toy, a Cars-themed blanket, rolls of tape and a tape dispenser.

Bradley had previously told police that her daughter was was wearing purple shorts and a purple T-shirt when she put her to bed.

Hunt:
The smell led to police getting a warrant to carry out a 17-hour search
of the house in Kansas City, Missouri, on Wednesday

In the search warrant revealed today, officers indicated that parents Bradley and Lisa's father Jeremy Irwin had restricted police access to their home.

'The only areas extensively processed
for DNA and fingerprints during the consent were the baby's bedroom and
possible points of entry,' court documents reported.

'The extent of the search had been 
limited in nature with consent' of the parents, police wrote.

The police application for a search warrant said that people involved in the case had 'revealed conflicting information for a clear direction' for the search for the missing child.

'Bradley made the statement she did 
not initially look for her baby behind the house because she 'was afraid
of what she might find,' the document revealed.

Missing: It has been over two weeks since 10-month-old Lisa Irwin was last seen

The police also cited a 
'garden area with portions of dirt having an appearance of being 
recently disturbed or overturned.'

Investigators
spent all day Wednesday and late into the night examining the inside of
the house, a large detached garage, the lawn and the house exterior, 
including the eaves along the roof line, according to television video.

Officers
and agents could be seen removing large brown paper bags of items, 
rolls of carpeting and dark panels that appeared to be from X-ray 
equipment.

Police had a 
warrant to search the house without the parents present. Deborah Bradley
and Jeremy Irwin are staying with relatives nearby.

Earlier
today witnesses claimed a man was spotted carrying a naked baby three 
houses from where the baby disappeared on the night she vanished.

A couple saw a man in a T-shirt 
walking with a child who appeared to be wearing no clothes at 12:15am on
October 4, just hours after the 11-month-old was last seen at her house
in Kansas City, Missouri.

Hours
later at around 4am another witness claims he saw a man walking along 
an intersection three miles from the house carrying a naked baby.

The mother of Lisa Irwin, Deborah 
Bradley, claims that her daughter was abducted after she put her to bed 
at 10:30pm on that night.

The witness statements, which were 
today revealed for the first time, appear to back up the testimony of 
the mother, who has been under suspicion.

A
woman, who has not been named but spoke to ABC News, said that she and 
her husband were three blocks from home of Lisa Irwin's parents when 
they saw the man and baby.

'It
was shocking because I couldn't imagine anyone outside walking with 
their baby in the cold like that with no clothes on,' she said.

'The parts of the body we seen, it didn't look like the baby had any clothing at all, just a diaper.'

Just under four hours later, another 
witness, Mike Thompson, said on his way home from work he saw what could
be the same man carrying the baby about three miles from the house.

'It
was about 4 o'clock in the morning, 45 degrees, baby didn't have a 
blanket or coat or nothing, and this guy's walking down the street,' he 
told ABC News.

'I thought it was kind of weird.'

He described the man as 5'7 or 5'8, 140 to 150lbs, and in his late thirties or early forties.

All three witnesses described the man as calm.

The
couple reported their sighting to the police on the morning they saw 
the man and said they have been interviewed four times by police.

Witness: This woman, who has not been named, said she and her husband saw a man carrying a naked baby three houses from Lisa Irwin's house

Testimony: Mike Thompson said that he thought the man's behaviour was 'weird'

Spotted: Another witness said that he saw a man with a baby walking at this intersection three miles from the Irwin's house at 4am on that night

Police said they are pursuing more than 60 out-of-state leads in their investigation into the disappearance.

Police spokesman Steve Young said police have cleared nearly 700 tips and leads in the disappearance.

The
continued police search comes as a woman who describes herself as 
Bradley's former best friend has claimed she had a dark side.

'She
was my friend at one time and I loved to be around her, but when I 
[saw] the other side of her and got to know the true Debbie, I couldn't 
even believe I trusted her with anything,' Shirley Pfaff told The 
Huffington Post.

Ms Pfaff, 
who met Bradley in 2002 when they were both military wives and lived 
across the street from each other said she was not surprised by 
inconsistencies around Bradley's story.

'I am not shocked that her story has changed like the wind,' she said. 'That's typical Debbie.'

Clues: The sightings were made in the middle of the night after Baby Lisa disappeared

Lisa
Irwin vanished on the night of October 3 in Kansas City, Missouri, 
after her mother Deborah Bradley claims she put her to bed at 10:30pm.

But
later that night, when Lisa's father Jeremy Irwin checked on the child 
when he got home from work, the baby was gone, and she was reported 
missing by her parents early on Tuesday.

Irwin
and Bradley claimed someone must have crept into their home while the 
child's mother and brothers slept and snatched the baby girl, saying 
that the front window had been tampered with.

Police have searched the couple's home, nearby wooded areas, an industrial park, landfills and sewers.
