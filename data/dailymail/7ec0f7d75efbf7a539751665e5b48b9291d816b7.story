A mother has lost a discrimination battle she was fighting against online giant Amazon as the final wish of her dying son.

Amazon worker David Peregrine, 36, launched a discrimination case against the shopping website when he was sent home from the Swansea warehouse without pay with a mystery illness.

But before Mr Peregrine could see his case come to court, his illness was diagnosed as cancer and he died in February.

His mother Ann Peregrine-Davies promised her dying son she would take up his battle but a judge found that they were not guilty of discrimination because they did not know about David's disease.

Amazon denied discriminating against David and say they could not let him work while he was in so much pain.

Mrs Peregrine-Davies, 62, appeared alone before an employment tribunal yesterday to accuse Amazon of disability discrimination against her son at their distribution warehouse in Swansea, South Wales.

She rejected getting a solicitor to present the case herself to an employment judge and said: 'When he knew it was cancer he asked me to pursue this tribunal process for him.

'He knew it was too late to help him but he just hoped it might help others. This is what has been driving me.'

The mother-of-three said Amazon should not have kept her son away from work without pay while he was ill.

The hearing in Cardiff was told how keen windsurfer David first suffered from cancer in 1998.

The disease did not develop and he continued with his life having regular checkups with his GP.

David started working for Amazon through an agency in September 2008 before becoming a full time member of staff in July 2009.

When he was taken on by the company he filled in a questionnaire telling them about his medical problems.

This was passed onto Amazon's occupational provider Manor House Health Care Limited.

But when David started complaining of back problems in November 2009 the company did not pass the relevant information onto his bosses.

Employment judge Roger Harper said: 
'Manor House should have put two and two together and noticed a link 
between his history of cancer and the back pain he suffered.

'But Amazon could not have been expected to make the link themselves.'

Mrs Peregrine-Davies said that when David was told to go home because his role was causing him too much pain, he had been excluded from work: 'It was additional worry causing him stress at a time when he needed it least.

'It affected him emotionally and financially, he was not allowed to go to work, not given any reason and not paid.'

The hearing was told that David had used up his paid sickness leave and had no other source of income.

He fell behind with payments on his car insurance and ended up being unable to drive.

David was forced to lodge a grievance with Amazon in a desperate attempt to get back to work.

This took two months for Amazon deal with while they tried to get his doctors records and David never received the results.

Amazon, who have since changed their 
occupational health providers, were criticised by Mr Harper for the way 
they dealt with David's case.

Mr Harper added: 'As an act of desperation David issued a grievance, he made it crystal clear he was suffering physically, emotionally and financially.'

Warring with a giant: The mother says after her son was sent home without pay, he fell behind on his bills ad payments

'Amazon would have been left in no doubt about the impact this was having on him.

'But the delay in there obtaining the 
medical notes was unacceptable and for whatever reason he never received
the results - and this was inexcusable behaviour.

Mr Harper also said that Amazon should have considered putting David on full paid medical suspension.

Speaking after the case Mrs 
Peregrine-Davies said: 'I am naturally saddened by the decision that has
been handed down by the employment tribunal today.

'When David knew he was too ill to 
return to work, it was still my son's wish to continue to fight his case
as he felt that it might at least help others.

'During the last few months of his 
life my son was made to suffer the most awful financial and emotional 
distress that added greatly to the physical difficulties that had begun 
to beset him.

'I have now done everything that I could have in an attempt to get justice for my son.

'For me it was still worth the fight 
if it serves to improve Amazon's practices and prevents anyone else 
suffering unnecessarily.'
