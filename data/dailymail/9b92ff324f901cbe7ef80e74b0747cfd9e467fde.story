A Queens-based graffiti artist was found dead on the tracks of a Brooklyn subway station this week after being electrocuted by the third rail.

Jason Wulf, 42, may have been 'tagging', or writing one's name in a stylized way, before he died, according to a friend. Wulf was found just before 10pm on Wednesday at the 25th Street Station in Sunset Park. He was reportedly alone when police arrived.

MTA said it is investigating his death.

Wulf may have been on his way from Brooklyn home to Queens, where he lived with his fiancée and their dog, the New York Post reported.

Friends of Wulf have been paying homage to the graffiti artist by spray painting his tag initials - 'DG' - in the subway station on the R line where he died, the paper said. 

Police officers were dispatched to the station to keep the taggers away, driving well wishers to pay their respects on other stations and on mailboxes.

It's unclear what Jason Wulf, shown here in an undated photo on Instagram, was doing before he died, but a friend said he was likely 'tagging'

Friends rapidly raised $10,000 from 92 people at giveforward.com to pay for his funeral.

A wake will be held at Seneca Chapels followed by a funeral service at St Matthias Church in Ridgewood, Queens, on Monday. His casket will be white so that it can be covered in graffiti. 

Wulf has been painting subway cars and buildings since 1985 and the founder of 'New Wave Crew.'.

'His tags, his throw ups, his fill-ins, his pieces, his canvasses - were all dope,' Bucky Turco wrote on animalnewyork.com. 'His canvasses were technically on par with those found in the world’s most prestigious art institutions.'

A friend of Wulf's, June Lang, 37, of Maspeth, Queens, called his death 'very sad.'

'It’s devastating,' Lang said. 'He had a talent that nobody had. It was more than tagging to him. It was an art. It was beautiful. He would do side walls for businesses. He didn’t just do the trains; he did everything.'

Beloved by friends, Wulf and his artistry also got him in trouble with the law. A police source said he had been arrested 13 times since 2008, including this past February for criminal mischief, graffiti and trespassing, the Post reported.
