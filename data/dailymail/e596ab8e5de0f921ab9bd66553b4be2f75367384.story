The US teenager accused in the 'body in the suitcase' murder in Bali has given birth by cesarean operation after being rushed to hospital when she went into labor.

Heather Mack, 19, was taken to hospital from Kerobokan Prison when she started to have contractions, guards confirmed. The baby, whom Mack said earlier would be named Stella, weighs 6.1 pounds. 

One of her attorneys, Anthony Scifo, said Mack gave birth by cesarean and she and the baby, named Stella, are healthy.

Break down: Heather Mack, from Chicago, weeps in a courtroom as she witnesses her trial in Bali, Indonesia on Thursday, March 12. Mack, 19, charged with premeditated murder in the death of her mother

Mack had the baby in the Wings Amerta building of the Sanglah Hospital.

Mack had earlier told friends who have been supporting her during jail visits that she was expecting her baby in April.

This means the child was born prematurely - but it is not known how long she expects to remain in hospital.

It is likely that her scheduled court appearance next week will be adjourned, allowing her time to recover from the birth.

A friend who accompanied her to the hospital told nursing staff that Mack will be taking the baby back to the prison with her.

Bali pirson rules allow prisoners to keep their babies until the age of two. Mack has said she wants the baby to stay in Bali so she can visit her while in jail.

It means that within the first few hours of her life, the baby will be a prisoner, locked in behind bars with her teenage mother.

A photographer who was at the hospital said he was able, for a short time, to look into a room where Mack was being prepared for the birth of her first child, fathered, she has earlier revealed, by boyfriend Tommy Schaefer.

The photographer said he saw an intravenous drip being prepared by a nurse and a doctor standing nearby.

There was speculation that if judges in her trial decide that the proceedings should continue next week, Mack will take the baby to court with her.

Unless he is granted special privileges, that might be the first time that Schaefer lays eyes on his baby daughter.

Mack and  Schaefer, 21, are being tried separately by Denpasar District Court, where they are charged with premeditated murder of her mother, Sheila von Wiese-Mack.

They could face a firing squad if found guilty. 

Last week  Schaefer told the trial that he had been attacked by Wiese-Mack and called a racially offensive name.

He said that his relationship with Heather was not endorsed by her mother and he went to Bali to decide how to tell her they were pregnant.

After meeting with Mack at the hotel, they discussed how to inform von Wiese-Mack that Mack was pregnant and agreed to meet in the hotel room where Mack and her mother were staying.

Speaking through an interpreter, Schaefer said Mack asked him to bring a metal fruit bowl, which he hid under his shirt as a 'precaution'.

Asked by a judge why it was hidden, Schaefer answered that he was not sure whether he would use it or not to protect himself.

According to Schaefer, he arrived in the room and found Mack weeping. He did not know why, but also saw that Mack's mother was screaming.

'She (von Wiese-Mack) was angry at me when she knew that Heather was pregnant,' Schaefer said, while trying to hold back tears.

Mack, who was sitting beside her lawyer, sobbed at the testimony.

He said that the victim insulted him using a racial slur and described her daughter as a prostitute who liked a black man.

He said the situation got heated when von Wiese-Mack asked her daughter for an abortion or to kill the unborn baby. Schaefer said that led to a quarrel in which von Wiese-Mack strangled him hard for about 30 seconds.

'I was angry, I took the fruit bowl and hit her,' Schaefer said, in tears.

He added that he did not remember how many times he hit the victim. After acknowledging she wasn't breathing, he tried to give her artificial respiration, while Mack, who had run in panic into the bathroom for about three minutes, came back and tried to revive her mother.

He said he was trembling and scared and called 911 on his mobile phone before realizing that he was not in the United States.

'Troubled': Mack has previously been described as 'troubled' and 'violent' by friends of her family

In her first questioning in court on Wednesday, Mack, who is eight months' pregnant, said Schaefer beat her mother with a metal soup bowl after von Wiese-Mack made the threat in an argument.

'The blow was not so hard ... and my mother was still resisting,' Mack said.

'I asked Tommy to stop and then I ran into the bathroom.'

Von Wiese-Mack's bludgeoned body was folded in half and stuffed into a suitcase with bloody sheets.

The suitcase was later found in a taxi at the posh St. Regis Hotel in August. 

In February a health scare saw Mack rushed to hospital after she collapsed with stomach pain and started bleeding.

She was taken to Bali's Sanglah Hospital, the main medical centre in Denpasar, where tourists and other foreigners are usually treated.

Hospital officials later said Miss Mack's baby was safe but she had been taken to hospital for an immediate check-up because she was in pain and had lost blood.

In January Mack had said she vowed to bring the baby up in the cramped Bali prison she shares with six others.

She has told fellow prisoners in the Wijaya Kusuma cell block of her intentions - but that has not gone down well with several of the other women.

'Make arrangements to get your baby out of here,' one prisoner is reported to have angrily told her. 'We're fed up with being woken by crying babies.'

In an adjoining cell a prisoner in her late 30s is raising a baby which cries through the night, waking other inmates.

'This is what your baby is going to be doing - waking us up - and we don't want that,' Heather was told by one woman - according to visitors leaving the prison on Friday after delivering food to relatives in the women's section of the notorious prison.

The protests, however, have failed to dampen the resolve of Mack.
