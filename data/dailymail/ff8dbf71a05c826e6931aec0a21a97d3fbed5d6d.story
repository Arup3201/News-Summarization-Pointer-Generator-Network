Jose Mourinho and Chelsea can feel hard done by after contentious decisions contributed to Burnley grabbing a point at Stamford Bridge, according to Alan Shearer.

The Blues boss spoke made reference to four key incidents which he believed changed the course of the 1-1 draw in his post-match interviews - citing a foul on Branislav Ivanovic, two penalty appeals and the sending off Nemanja Matic.

Match of the Day pundit Shearer, who was backed-up by Robbie Savage, agreed with Mourinho and claimed that referee Martin Atkinson was at fault on each occasion.

Nemanja Matic was sent off after pushing Burnley's Ashley Barnes to the ground in the second half

Speaking about an Ashley Barnes challenge on Ivanovic which went unpunished in the 30th minute, Shearer said: 'I think Martin Atkinson has had a terrible game today. 

'Ashley Barnes goes up for the header with Ivanovic, he leads with his foot and he's very fortunate. You can see he kicks out, studs into the back of his hamstring and that should be a yellow card.'

Former Leicester midfielder Savage added: 'Definite yellow card there. Ivanovic's reaction is quite poor, he rolls over and gets up but I agree – a yellow card for Ashley Barnes.'

The second incident - a Chelsea penalty appeal which was turned down in the 33rd minute - also drew criticism from Shearer and Savage. 

'This is blatant handball,' said Shearer of Michael Kightly's successful attempt to block a shot from Ivanovic.

'The referee has got a brilliant view of it, he's about 10 yards away. He turns his back, sticks his arm out and that has to be a penalty.'

30 - Ashley Barnes sends Branislav Ivanovic crashing to the ground in an aerial challenge after a knee in the back. Ivanovic rolls over twice before leaping up in anger when he realises no action is being taken. Verdict: Should have been a free-kick and could have been a yellow card. for Barnes.

69 - Barnes misses the ball and almost snaps Nemanja Matic's left shin with his studs but Atkinson waves play on. An enraged Matic leaps up and pushes Barnes over violently. Atkinson sends off Matic and books Ivanovic for trying to take red card out of his hand. Verdict:Shocking tackle merited a red card for Barnes and a Chelsea free-kick.

'The referee has got a brilliant view of it, he's about 10 yards away. He turns his back, sticks his arm out and that has to be a penalty.'

'He's made himself bigger,' added Savage. 'His arm is in an unnatural position. It's a definite penalty.'

The Premier League leaders had another strong appeal for a spot-kick turned down 10 minutes later when Diego Costa went down under a challenge from Jason Shackell. 

Shearer said: 'He shoves him, he gets his legs caught up in his and it's a shove. You can see from Costa's reaction what he thinks of it. I've got to agree with Jose – it should be a penalty.'

Savage added: 'Martin Atkinson was in a great position once again but he wasn't having it. Mourinho's right – he and his team have been hard done by today.'

The most controversial incident occurred in the second half when Nemanja Matic was shown a straight red card after pushing Barnes to the floor following a dangerous tackle from the Burnley man.

Once again Shearer and Savage agreed with Mourinho, although the Serb's sending off was justified. 

'It's a horrific tackle, it really is,' said Shearer. 

'It's dangerous, it's naughty. I understand that reaction. It's not right but I understand it because he could have easily broken his leg there. 

'For that Matic will miss the cup final next week and that's a disaster for him and for Chelsea. He (Barnes) doesn't even get a yellow card.'

'Ashley Barnes should've been booked in the first half and that should have been a straight red,' added Savage. 

'He's (Matic) lucky he's not out for six, seven, eight months. Mourinho's right today. They've been hard done by.'
