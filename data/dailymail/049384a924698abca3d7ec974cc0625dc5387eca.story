Despite tonight's disappointing loss against Andy Murray,  tennis greats and promoters alike are forecasting a bright and wealthy future for Australian teenage tennis sensation Nick Kyrgios.

Tuesday's night's match, in which the world No 6 defeated the 19-year-old from Canberra in straight sets, may have lost Kyrgios the chance to play in the Australian Open semi-finals, but it still pushed his earnings for his 12-month professional career past the $1 million mark.

Some experts believe that is just the start, tipping him to make $50 million as he becomes one of the biggest stars on the tennis tour.

The Scot secured his victory against the 19-year-old in three straight sets, 6-3, 7-6, and 6-3 

Watched in the stands by his mother Nel, father Giorgos, and brother, Christos, Kyrgios bared his emotions throughout the match, screaming several times in triumph when he won points against Murray.

Kyrgios quickly lost the first set of the match to the world number six, with the Scot using his well-honed tactical skills to secure the set 6-3.  

His mother, Nel, said during the break that no matter the outcome of the game, she was very proud of her youngest son.

'He's done a marvellous job, beyond expectations,' she said.

'He'll just have to do what he has to do. It's a big crowd, big occasion, big player.'

She said that she was determined to watch the match, and had brought some emotional support along for the match.

'I'll try and enjoy it. I've got a friend here to calm me down and tie me to chair if need be,' she said.

Despite not progressing to the Australian Open semi-finals, the 19-year-old was guaranteed to make $340,000 for the match.

Estimates of the fiery young sports star's potential income have skyrocketed, with promoters anticipating Kyrgios could earn up to $50 million over the next ten years. 

Celebrity agent Max Markson, whose clients include Kim Kardashian, Bill Clinton, and Nelson Mandela, said that the young Australian was in a high class of Australian tennis players after advancing to the quarter-finals.

'All the top experts and players say that he has an amazing future ahead of him. No doubt if he's made a million in the last year he stands to move forward,' Mr Markson said.

'If he keeps playing the way he's playing, and could win a grand slam, he'd be in the pantheon of Australian tennis,' he said.

Murray said in the post-match interview that  he had 'seen how dangerous Nick is'

Mr Markson said that while Kyrgios was a very interesting personality, it would be his playing which would determine his future,

'The appeal to a younger demographic is definitely there, but at the end of the day, it's all about his performance on the tennis court,' Mr Markson said.

'He's tall, good -looking, he's got charisma, which is great for commercial companies to be involved with, but it won't be looks or character that will benefit him in the end,' he said.

'As long as he plays consistent tennis and works hard, the tennis world is his oyster.' 

Just a year after his professional debut, former world number one Rod Laver predicted that the 'tall kid' will have a 'great future'. 

The tennis great was in the crowd for the quarter final with his wife, supporting the young Aussie along with many other media and sporting personalities. 

One Direction's Niall Horan was in the crowd, along with Mark Philippoussis, Renee Bargh and Josh Gibson, Kathy Freeman, Layne Beachley and her husband Kirk Pengilly.

Frances Abbott, daughter of Prime Minister Tony Abbott was in the crowd to cheer her fellow Aussie on, along with her boyfriend Lindsay Smith.

In the post-match interview, Murray said that he had seen Kyrgios perform over the past 18 months, and that he had 'seen how dangerous Nick is'.

'I wasn't going to underestimate him,' he said.

The world number six said that he knew what it was like to be a teenager in the spotlight, and implored the Australian public to let the young tennis star to grow.

'Try not to put too much pressure on him. He needs to be able to mature and develop. He'll make mistakes, he's young, and growing up in the spotlight isn't easy,' Murray said.

'He'll keep learning and getting better. He's an incredibly talent, not many people have done what he's done at his age,' he said.  

The 19-year-old said that the experience had been stressful but also enjoyable, and that his focus going ahead was going to be on staying healthy and enjoying the games he played.

Murray won the last and only match the pair played in Toronto last year, soundly beating the young Australian in the biggest loss of his career to date

'I wasn't going to underestimate him,' Murray said

'I'm happy I got as far as I did. It was a great experience,' Kyrgios said in his post-match interview.

'This is why I play the game, to play these kind of tournaments,' he said.

Kyrgios said that he was still 'growing into' his body, but took his increased level of fitness compared with his performance at Wimbledon as a positive.

'These [the top five seeded players] are incredible athletes, they're really on another level,' Kyrgios said.

The 19-year-old said he had felt very supported by the mainly Australian crowd during the match, but that he had tried to focus on his game rather than the thousands of spectators.

'I definitely felt the support...it's one of the best courts in the world,' he said. 

Murray's measured and calculated game won him the match in the end, securing his victory 6-3 against Kyrgios.

Murray won the last and only match the pair played in Toronto last year, soundly beating the young Australian in the biggest loss of his career to date.  

Kyrgios's older brother Christos said that his brother had 'tightened up' during the tie-breaker which lost him the set, but that it was a mistake anyone could have made, even if they were experienced.

'If he can keep in it, mentally and physically, he'll be right,' Christos said. 

Kyrgios used his racquet to show his frustration, hitting himself on the head and breaking his racquet when he threw it down during a tense game in the second set- an incident which the referee overlooked despite strict code violations against such actions.  

Murray said that it was 'completely understandable' that Kyrgios was the crowd favourite, and said it was an honour to play 'in front of a packed crowd on a great court.' 

'It’s a privilege to play on a court with so many great players watching,' Murray said.

'It was a tough match, he [Kyrgios] played extremely well,' he said.
