Tragic: Lance Corporal James Hill, of the 1st Battalion The Coldstream Guards, was killed in October 2009 but it could have been prevented

A soldier who was about to be married was killed by an improvised explosive device (IED) in Afghanistan after the army failed to properly sweep a training area for insurgent bombs, an inquest heard today.

Lance Corporal James Hill, of the 1st Battalion The Coldstream Guards, died on an 'unsecured' firing range 2.5 miles outside Camp Bastion in central Helmand on October 8 2009.

Surrey Coroner Richard Travers said today the army ignored safety warnings and instead of carrying out a full four-hour search for mines, only 45 minutes was spent sweeping the area for deadly IEDs.

Up to 300 service personnel would be trained on the firing range each 
day, particularly in peak periods such as April and October when a new 
influx of troops from the UK would arrive, he said.

But the firing range was also 'swamped' by local 
residents after each session who scavenged for spent ammunition cases to
sell as scrap metal, also making it easy to plant an explosive.

Within nine days of L/Cpl Hill's death, the army had created a new firing range within the secure fence of Camp Bastion.

Recording a verdict that L/Cpl Hill was unlawfully killed whilst on 
active service in Afghanistan, Mr Travers passed on his condolences to 
the soldier's family who were present for the hearing and said the army could have done more

He added that the area of the range where the soldiers waited between exercises and where
L/Cpl was killed, was not clearly marked to show where it had been 
cleared with a Vallon bomb locator used by British forces.

'I find that the metal content of the IED which killed L/Cpl 
Hill would have been such that the Vallon operator would have been blind
and deaf not to have registered it,' Mr Travers said.

'The register would have gone off the scale and there would have been a 
loud double tone that the handler would definitely have heard.

Changes: After James Hill's death the army moved their training area inside the secure Camp Bastion camp, pictured, in central Helmand

'Concerns relating to the range team's ability to clear the range to the safest possible level in the circumstances prevailing at the time were brought to the attention of the chain of command at Camp Bastion by the range conducting officer.

'It is not clear what action, if any, was taken by the chain of command as a result of those concerns.

'Immediately after James Hill's death substantial changes were made to the firing ranges and the manner in which they were protected and in which the training was done.

'It was within the scope of the powers of the military authorities to have taken those measures prior to James Hills' death.'

Speaking outside the inquest, L/Cpl Hill's parents, of Redhill, Surrey, said the Army had failed in its duty of care for their son.

In a statement released jointly with their son's fiancee Anastasia Newman, they said: 'James' death totally shattered our lives and now we have been deeply hurt all over again as we have discovered that his death was needless and entirely preventable.

Safety fears: Up to 300 soldiers in Afghanistan were trained on the shooting range every day but it was not properly secured

'It was not just those responsible for planting the IED that caused his death, but a culture of complacency and a disregard for every soldier's safety that reached right up the chain of command.

'Those in charge of his safety owed him a duty of care, a duty, we feel, they totally and utterly failed.

'A proper system of communicating up and down the chain of command could possibly have prevented this tragedy.

'In addition, we have heard how the issues of resources and training, the assessment of risk and the perception of threat had a large impact on the overall situation that led to James' death.

'We can only hope that the enormity of what has happened is recognised and this is never allowed to happen again.

'James' life was irreplaceable and he meant the world to us.

'We would like to take this opportunity to put on record our gratitude to all the people who have helped us in so many ways through this most difficult of times.'

When asked if he had faith in the MoD to address the issues raised by the inquest, Mr Hill said: 'Not totally, we can only hope, that is what this is all about, trying to prevent something like this happening again.'

His wife added: 'We just hope to stop anything like this happening again to other families.'

Mrs Hill added: 'We just had Afghanistan to get through.

'He was our only child and Anastasia and James were so happy together.

'We were just looking forward to it.'

Miss Newman explained how she and L/Cpl Hill had been planning for the wedding which would have taken place following his return from Afghanistan, which was his second tour of duty there.

She said: 'The wedding was planned, the dress was bought.

'James is and always will be the love of my life and I feel so grateful to have had the time I had with him.
'He will live on forever in my heart and memories until we are together again.'

Lieutenant Colonel Robin Sergeant, the current commanding officer of 1st Battalion Coldstream Guards, said: 'L/Cpl Hill was a first rate Coldstreamer who loved nothing more than soldiering with his colleagues.

'He is enormously missed across the 1st Battalion Coldstream Guards and our prayers and condolences are with his family and friends.'

An MoD spokesman said: 'Our thoughts remain with the family of Lance Corporal James Hill.

'Searches of the training range were carried out using Vallon detectors and no IEDs were found.

'However, an investigation into the incident showed that more thorough procedures to reduce the risk of IEDs being planted should have been carried out.

'As a result of this tragic incident, immediate steps were taken to prevent any further risk from IEDs on the range, including additional force protection.

'Since 2010, ranges have been located within the expanded perimeter of Camp Bastion and stringent checks are conducted regularly to ensure that the ranges are being used as safely as possible.'
