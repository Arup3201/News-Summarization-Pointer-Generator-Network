North Korea is digging a new underground tunnel as they apparently prepare to carry out a third nuclear test, according to South Korean intelligence officials.

Satellite images show that the final work is being carried out for a test at a site in Punggye-r, in the north-east of the country, where tests were conducted in 2006 and 2009.

The report was released as North Korea prepares to launch a long-range rocket that Washington - which others say is a cover for testing missile technology that could be used to fire on the U.S.

They announced plans last month to 
launch an 'observation satellite' during 
mid-April celebrations as they mark 100th anniversary of the birth of North 
Korean founder Kim Il Sung.

David Cameron has warned North Korea that it would be 'unacceptable' to defy calls for rocket tests to be abandoned.

Speaking on a visit to nearby Japan, the
 Prime Minister urged the state to 'take a different path' and engage 
with the international community.

Mr Cameron and counterpart Yoshihiko Noda discussed the threat from North Korea when they held talks today.

'On the issue of North Korea we have 
said very clearly and the Japanese and others have said that it is 
unacceptable to launch these satellites and missiles,' Mr Cameron told 
TV station News Zero.

'Now there is a new leadership in North 
Korea they should be taking this opportunity to change their approach, 
engaging with the rest of the word and stopping this sort of activity.

    'If they go ahead it should be condemned in the strongest possible terms by the UN Security Council.

'We have to send the clearest possible 
message... Clearly North Korea is quite a bankrupt country; they are 
unable to feed their own people and interestingly America has been 
helping.

'We need to explain that they need to 
take a different path. They need to do less in terms of weapons and the 
military and more engagement with the rest of the world.

'If they launch this satellite, that is clearly a breach of the UN resolution that has already been ratified.'

Observers fear a repeat of 2009, when international criticism of the North's last long-range rocket launch prompted Pyongyang to walk away from nuclear disarmament negotiations and, weeks later, conduct its second nuclear test.

The report by South Korean intelligence officials said: 'North Korea is covertly preparing for a third nuclear test, which would be another grave provocation.

'North Korea is digging up a new underground tunnel at the Punggye-ri nuclear test site, in addition to its existing two underground tunnels, and it has been confirmed that the excavation works are in the final stages.'

Dirt believed to have been brought from other areas is piled at the tunnel entrance, the report said, something experts say is needed to fill up tunnels before a nuclear test.

The dirt indicates there is a 'high possibility' that North Korea will stage a nuclear test as plugging tunnels was the final step taken during its two previous underground nuclear tests.

The U.S., Japan, Britain and other 
nations have urged North Korea to cancel the launch, warning that firing
 the long-range rocket would violate U.N. resolutions and North Korea's 
promise to refrain from engaging in nuclear and missile activity.

North Korean dictator Kim Jong-un has unveiled the rocket which experts say is 130 feet long and equipped with boosters that would 
give it a range of 6,200 miles.

The U.S., Japan, Britain and other 
nations 
have urged the nationÂ  to cancel the launch, warning that firing it 
would not only violate U.N. resolutions but also North Korea's 
promise to stop engaging in nuclear and missile activity.

North Korean space officials said 
that all assembly and preparations for this week's planned satellite 
launch have been completed, and denied it is a cover for a missile test.

Space officials told reporters at a 
news conference in Pyongyang that the launch of the three-stage rocket 
is on target to take place sometime between April 12-16 as part of 
centennial birthday commemorations for late President Kim Il Sung, the 
country's founder.

Ryu Kum Chol, deputy director 
of the Space Development Department of the Korean Committee for Space 
Technology said the satellite, equipped with a video camera designed to capture images of 
North Korea's terrain and send back data about weather conditions, was 
being mounted on the rocket today.

'All the assembly and preparations of the satellite launch are done,' he said.

The United States, Britain, Japan and
 others have urged North Korea to cancel the launch, saying it would be 
considered a violation of U.N. resolutions prohibiting the country from 
nuclear and ballistic missile activity.

Experts say the Unha-3 carrier is the
 same type of rocket that would be used to launch a long-range missile 
aimed at the U.S. and other targets. North Korea has tested two atomic 
devices but is not believed to have mastered the technology needed to 
mount a warhead on a long-range missile.

Ryu acknowledged similarities between
 the rockets used for launching a satellite and a ballistic missile. 
However, he noted that solid fuel is used to launch ballistic missiles, 
while the Kwangmyongsong-3 satellite will be sent using liquid fuel.

Also, in order to be a success, a ballistic missile would require a large payload, he said.

'Our satellite weighs 100 kilograms. 
For a weapon, a 100-kilogram payload wouldn't be very effective,' he 
said, dismissing assertions that the launch is a cover for developing 
missile technology as 'nonsense.'

Ryu said he could not answer any questions about a possible nuclear test in the future.

Japan and South Korea, meanwhile, said
 they are prepared to shoot down any parts of the rocket that threaten 
to fall in their territory - a move North Korea's Foreign Ministry 
warned would be considered a declaration of war.

The launch is scheduled to take place 
three years after North Korea's last announced attempt to send a 
satellite into space, a liftoff condemned by the U.N. Security Council. 
North Korea walked away from nuclear disarmament negotiations in 
protest, and conducted an atomic test weeks later that drew tightened 
U.N. sanctions.

It is meant to show that North Korea 
has become a powerful, prosperous nation, celebrate the centenary of 
founder Kim Il Sung's birth, and usher in a new era under his grandson, 
Kim Jong Un, said Koh Yu-hwan, a professor of North Korean studies at 
Seoul's Dongguk University.

'North Korea needs to show some 
tangible achievements to its people to solidify Kim Jong Un's 
leadership,' he said. 'North Korea intends to provide its people with a 
sense of pride.'

Kim Jong Un took power following the 
December death of his father, longtime leader Kim Jong Il, and is 
expected to assume more top posts during high-profile political and 
parliamentary meetings later this week - a step analysts say will 
formally complete the country's second hereditary power transfer.
