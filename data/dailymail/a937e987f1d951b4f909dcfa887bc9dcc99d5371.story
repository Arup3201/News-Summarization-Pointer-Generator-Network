Despite listed at what realtors are calling a bargain of a price, a three-bedroom home described as perfect for entertaining while nestled in secluded 1.5 acre woods is still without a buyer.

What not all prospective buyers initially know, the picturesque home in Bath, Ohio, is the house where serial killer Jeffrey Dahmer grew up and took the life of his first victim in 1978. It would be the start of what would be 17 victims he confessed to killing in all.

'Some people are not going to want any part of it. Some people want a part of it. But there have been families that have lived here since that happened,' real estate agent Gregory Greco told Fox 8 Cleveland during a tour of the home.

For sale: This three bedroom on 1.5 acres of secluded green land in Ohio is listed for $329,000

History: What many potential buyers do not first know is that the home is where serial killer Jeffrey Dahmer grew up and took the life of his first victim

Former occupant: Serial killer Jeffrey Dahmer is pictured during his trial in the murder of 17 men he confessed to having killed with the first in 1978

'Perfect for entertaining,' he said guiding a Fox8 reporter around the roughly 2,200 square-feet home. 'The rooms flow, this room could be a library or office space. And off of this, we have a greenhouse.'

While listed on Mr Greco's website for $329,000, what's not, are the details of the home's past.

Those details are better filled in by its latest owner, Chris Butler, who recalled to NPR of its purchase after initial unease over its history.

'I was instantly charmed the first time I pulled in the driveway and was really puzzled why such a fantastic pad had gone unsold for six months, though it was priced way below anything comparable in the area,' he told NPR in 2009.

As he next explains, the first 
victim's body - a young hitchhiker named Steven Hick - was dismembered 
by Dahmer in the home's crawlspace.

Today,
 walking through the ranch-style home, the kitchen is entirely updated 
with granite counter tops and higher end appliances.

Features: Inside perspective buyers could be further charmed by its updated kitchen featuring granite counter tops

Green: The home also features a wrap-around deck overlooking the lush green front and backyard

Details: One of the last buyers in 2009 said the home's low price made it a near steal though did learn that a man was dismembered in its crawl space

Stepping outside, a wrap-around porch prompts its residents before a quiet, green backyard, and down below, a greenhouse steps out onto the grounds.

'In the greenhouse is an atrium with 
great lighting. Thereâ€™s some plants, a nice finished floor, and we can 
walk right onto the grounds,' Mr Greco notes.

To
 prevent those more curious at touring the house than buying, Mr Greco 
says those interested must have a pre-approval or proof of having the 
funds for its purchase to visit.

'This is not a museum. This is someone's home,' he said.

But there is a market for such homes.

An idyllic-looking Spanish-style home
 in Houston, Texas was ideal for Peter Muller. It looked picture perfect with 
its brick exteriors and leafy lawn.

Thankfully, the history of the home didn't bother the new owner. And that is just as well.

Low: This is the home where Andrea Yates, 37, drowned her five children in a bathtub. It was bought for a knock-down price of just $87,000 three years later

Shocking: Andrea Yates confessed to killing her five children in their Houston home. She is pictured with four of her children before the birth of another daughter

It
 was where Andrea Yates, 37, drowned her five children in a bathtub. She
 was sentenced to life in prison after being convicted of the murders in
 2001.

Mr Muller bought the home three years
 later for an incredible price of $87,000. And he said he doesn't care a
 jot about its horrific history.

Though many may baulk at purchasing such properties, studies have found that homes like these are great bargains.

Historic: Lizzie Borden, pictured, stood trial for killing her father and stepmother with an ax but she was later acquitted

Horrific: Four members of the wealthy Lemp family committed suicide in this home over 40 years

Sad: This home is where 6-year-old JonBenet Ramsey was murdered in  1996

Buyers can expect to pay up to 25 per cent off the standard market price.

This could be seen with the 
former home of O.J Simpson, who was accused of killing his ex-wife 
Nicole Brown Simpson and her friend Ronald Goldman at the Los Angeles 
property.

It was sold for just $590,000 after two years on the market. This was $200,000 less than the initial asking price.

And not only can some properties with tainted pasts become homes - they can also become thriving businesses.

killing her father Andrew and stepmother Abby is now the Lizzie Borden

The entire house can be rented for weddings and events, with room rates starting at $200 off-season.
