Thousands of Iraqi women are being forced into sex slavery in brothels run by a 'police force' of British women jihadis, it has been reported.

As many as 3,000 women and girls have been taken captive from the Yazidi tribe in Iraq as Isis militants continue their reign of terror across the region.

Sources now say that British female jihadis operating a
 religious police force called the 
al-Khanssaa brigade, that punishes women for 'un-Islamic' behaviour, have set up brothels to for the use of Isis fighters.

Thousands of Iraqi women are being forced into sex slavery in brothels for Islamic State fighters and run by a 'police force' of British women jihadis, it has been reported

A source told the Mirror: 'These women are using barbaric interpretations of the Islamic faith to justify their actions.

'They
 believe the militants can use these women as they please as they are 
non-Muslims. It is the British women who have risen to the top of the 
Islamic State’s sharia police and now they are in charge of this 
operation.

'It is as bizarre as it is perverse.'

Jihadi: A key figure in the al-Khanssaa brigade is believed to be Aqsa Mahmood, 20, of Glasgow

The
 think tank MEMRI (the Middle East Media Research Institution) released a
 report saying that IS had taken many Yazidi women to be sold and used 
as sex slaves.

The 
al-Khanssaa brigade is a female-only militia set up by the Islamic State
 in Raqqa, Syria, with a key figure believed to be Aqsa Mahmood, 20, of 
Glasgow, who fled to the country last year.

Academics
 at King's College London have identified three other British females as
 members of the group - and say there are about 60 UK women who have 
gone to Syria on jihad.

Most
 of these women - including privately-educated Mahmood - are aged 
between 18 and 24, with al-Khanssaa said to be seeking out people 
engaging in Western culture in Raqqa.

It
 is believed that US hostages James Foley and Steven Sotloff were both 
beheaded in the desert near Raqqa - and therefore the British women in 
al-Khanssaa could know who killed them.

Melanie
 Smith, a research associate at King's College's International Centre 
for the Study of Radicalisation, told journalists Robert Mendick and 
Robert Verkaik of The Sunday Telegraph: ‘Al-Khanssaa is a sharia law police brigade. This is Isis’s female law enforcement.

'We
 think it’s a mixture of British and French women but its social media 
accounts are run by the British and they are written in English.

‘Given
 how small the community networks are - we know there are about 500 male
 British jihadis out there - it is quite likely these women move in the 
same circles as the British killer of Foley and Sotloff.’

What do they know? Among the UK women going to 
Syria are Zahra (left) and Salma Halane (right), 16, twins from 
Chorlton, Manchester

Devastation: Syrians inspecting the rubble of a damaged houses yesterday following a Syrian government airstrike in the north-eastern city of Raqqa, which is an Islamic State stronghold

Confusion reigns over the identity of
 the Islamic State executioner known as 'Jihadi John' after security 
experts last week appeared to dismiss suggestions he was a former rapper
 from London.

The masked man, who speaks with a 
clear London accent, was originally thought to be ‘hip hop jihadist’ 
Abdel-Majed Abdel Bary, but it is now understood to be another man.

British
 women are reportedly being given major roles within al-Khanssaa because
 Islamic State chiefs see them as the most committed of the foreign 
female jihadis.

The Daily Mail reported yesterday how a growing band of young women have left their families in Britain to join the jihadi cause in Syria.

Many
 have formed ‘intense friendships’ in the Islamic State stronghold of 
Raqqa. Academics at King’s College said they have seen ‘a big uptake’ in
 the number of UK women going to Syria.

Among
 them are Salma and Zahra Halane, 16, twins from Manchester, and mother 
Khadijah Dare, 22, who is married to a Swedish jihadist.

Another
 is Muslim convert Sally Jones, 45, from Chatham, Kent, an unemployed 
mother who has ranted online about how she wants to behead Christians 
with a ‘blunt knife’.

Muslim convert: Sally Jones, 45, of Chatham, Kent, claims to have joined bloodthirsty jihadis roaming the lawless border between Syria and Iraq

The British mother-of-two who joined 
Islamic State extremists after running away to wage jihad with her 
toyboy husband fears she will never be able to return to Britain.

Muslim
 convert Sally Jones, 45, of Chatham, Kent, who has spent a lifetime on 
state benefits, said she was now raising her ten-year-old son Jojo under
 the Islamic State.

The
 unemployed mother, who was once an aspiring rock musician, claims to 
have joined bloodthirsty jihadis roaming the lawless border between 
Syria and Iraq.

She married convicted computer hacker Junaid Hussain, 20, upon her arrival in Syria, and told journalist Dipesh Gadher of The Sunday Times:
 ‘I had been travelling for 24 hours… lol and we got married the very 
day I got here. My little boy became a Muslim too that very day.’ 

She added: ‘Becoming a Muslim changed my life. I can’t help but be militant when all they do is kill us for being Muslim. 

'You
 know they killed 1,220,550 innocent Muslims in the illegal Iraq war. 
The US and UK government - it’s that wot [sic] did it for me… It’s them 
that’s the terrorists, not us.’

It
 is not clear how Mrs Jones - who has abused Jews and praised Osama bin 
Laden - obtained the inflated civilian death toll figure.

Jones
 revealed that she had left her other son, aged 18, in Britain - but 
added that she will be jailed if she tries to return to the UK, saying: 
‘I can’t ever go back, they will throw away the key.’
