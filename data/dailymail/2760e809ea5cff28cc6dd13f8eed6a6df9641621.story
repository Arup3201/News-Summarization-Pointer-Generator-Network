Thousands of firearms fanatics gathered in northern Arizona this weekend for the biggest organised machine gun festival in the U.S.

Twice a year the Big Sandy Shoot, near the town of Wikieup, turns the Arizona desert into what is probably the biggest civilian shooting range anywhere in the world.

Enthusiasts travel from across the country with their weapons to socialise, compare guns, and riddle explosives filled targets with hot lead.

Organised by MG Shooters LLC, the Big Sandy Shoot began some three decades ago as a series of recreational target shoots for 'friendly groups of machine-gun fanatics'.

Now the event is on major music festival scale, with thousands of gun-owners, their families, and mere spectators paying to camp for three days and soak up the ultimate in American gun culture.

Reuters photographer Joshua Lott took his camera along to take some shots of his own.

On the agency's Photographers Blog he wrote: 'The three day event attracted hundreds of spectators and shooters from around the country.

'Some traveled as far as Washington and Mississippi to fire their weapons along a mountain range set up with zombie targets, trash cans and buckets and barrels filled with aluminium oxide mixed with ammonium nitrate to create explosions upon impact.

'Several styles of the vintage Browning machine guns used during World War II and the Korean War along with a replica gold 1877 Bulldog Gatling Gun received much attention from the crowd.

'A family from Utah soaked up some fun cruising around in a 1953 Willys Jeep with a Browning .30 calibre machine gun positioned in the centre console.'

the shooting range and three days' camping, or a mere $25 for 
camping-only spectator tickets

Boom: The whale target explodes after taking too much punishment

It's what they're for: Shooters fire their 
weapons down the quarter-mile firing range, which features more than a 
thousand 'reactive' (i.e. exploding) targets and also remote controlled 
aerial targets

The Big Sandy Shoot draws the crowds not just with its mammoth quarter-mile firing range, but also staff who lay on more than a thousand 'reactive' (i.e. exploding) targets, remote controlled aerial targets, extended night shoots and, if you get bored of your own weapons, thousands of exotic guns for hire.

Participants pay $220 (£150) for a 10ft-wide spot on the shooting range and three days' camping, or a mere $25 (£16.45) for camping-only spectator tickets.

Spectators can shoot too by hiring one of the machine guns on offer from rental booths, which range from submachine guns and medium battle carbines, to huge military-grade .50 calibre belt-fed, tripod-mounted machine guns.

First-time visitors are encouraged to chat to old hands, who are sources of a wealth of firearms facts.

As thousands of gunmen and women gathered in the Arizona desert, homes in the US town where a crazed gunman killed 26 people, 20 of them children, have been receiving automated phone calls from the National Rifle Association gun lobby.

They began last week, only three months after the Sandy Hook Elementary School shootings.

Residents said the calls urge people to tell their state legislators to oppose gun control proposals.

Politicians are debating whether to ban military-style assault weapons, prohibit high-capacity ammunition magazines and other measures in response to the school shootings.

Dan O'Donnell lives in Newtown's Sandy Hook area and said the robocalls were 'ridiculous and insensitive'.

'Our machine gun shooters are not only collectors, but are also into the history,' says the MG Shooters website.

'You
will see things from the very old (Gatling gun) to the very newest 
(minigun). They can tell you not only the guns capacities, but in which 
wars and battles they were used.

'Fortunately for us, most enjoy talking about them.'

With so many lethal weapons floating around, organisers take security - and health and safety - very seriously. All visitors are asked to sign a release waiver before they are allowed on the site, and are banned from carrying sidearms.

Only security guards are allowed to carry loaded guns off the firing line. 'MGShooters LLC has assembled a large loyal range officer department.

'They are itendified [sic] by red t-shirts, with MG Shooters logo and the word SECURITY in large, panic reducing letters.'

The most spectacular light shows take place at night when the tracer rounds from the many simultaneously firing machine guns light up the dark Arizona sky.

Mr Lott added: 'Each night green and red streaks from tracers shot across the field created a glow along with the moon and stars that shined above the Arizona sky.

'People gathered around to see the spectacular light show that closed out both days of the shoot. Fireworks were added for the finale of the last night.'

After a string of firearms massacres, most recently in the uncomfortably similar sounding Sandy Hook, public opinion in the U.S. is increasingly divided about the country's lax gun control.

Events like the Big Sandy Shoot give those devoted to the Second Amendment an opportunity to get together and share their hobby in a way they would be unable to elsewhere.

Mr Lott concluded: 'What sounds like a war zone with no visible enemy, is just a group of machine gun enthusiast having an enjoyable time with friends and family.'
