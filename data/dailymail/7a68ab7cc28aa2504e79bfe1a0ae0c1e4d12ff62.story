Tragic: Mother-of-two Katrina-Rose Black died in the fire in her Burnley home on Sunday

Senior detectives are investigating a mysterious house fire that killed a mother-of-two - just three years after she survived another blaze.

Katrina-Rose Black, 21, who gave birth to her second child in February, was killed by flames that broke out at her home in Burnley at 11.30pm on Sunday night.

Neighbours heard an explosion and ran into the street where they saw Miss Black at her first-floor bedroom window banging on the glass and pleading for help.

Three fire engines were called to put out
the blaze, which blew the front door off its hinges, but they could not
save Miss Black.

A post mortem examination found her death was 'unexplained', and the fire service could not find a cause for the fire.

Today it emerged that neighbours rescued Miss Black from a blaze
in her previous home in February 2010.

Two people poured water over Miss Black, then 17, as she lay unconscious, before taking her to hospital where she was treated for smoke inhalation. She recovered and police found the fire was not suspicious.

However, after days of forensic tests, a Forces Major Investigations Team (FMIT) has been appointed to explore Sunday's blaze, which remains a mystery.

Today, reports claim Miss Black had been involved in a dispute with a man for the past few months.

The FMIT will now examine Facebook and text messages sent between the pair.

According to local media, a man sent her a Facebook message in August saying: 'Rosie 
please unblock me im sorry for the messages I was very drunk last night 
how am I supposed to get intouch with u if I need u about anything.'

A post mortem examination on Miss Black's body, removed from the property at around 3pm on Monday, did not determine a cause of death, although it ruled out rumours she was pregnant with her third child.

Forensic investigators combed the terraced house in Hapton, near Burnley, removing a door and other items for testing.

Horrific: The front door was blown off its hinges in the house fire at 11.30pm on Sunday

During the fire, smoke was seen billowing from the house before the door was blown off its hinges.

A witness said: 'One of the neighbours heard an explosion. They said they saw a girl up at the bedroom window but she couldn’t smash the window.

'There was a man on the street saying "she’s upstairs and the house is on fire".

'Everyone came out of their houses and were telling her to smash the window and jump out but she couldn’t. It was a terrible scene.

'It was the early hours of Monday morning when we saw the ambulances and blue lights.'

Tributes: Flowers were left outside the house of mother-of-two Miss Black, who gave birth in February

The neighbour added: 'She was a smiley girl, she used to speak 
to my my mum and then when she passed away Rosie came over to pass on 
her condolences. She was a caring girl.

'She had a little one but I wouldn’t see him often, I did see her with another child. A man used to come and go - but I don’t know if he lived there.

'She had asthma, it must have been quite bad - one time paramedics were called to her house.'

Another neighbour said: 'My brother said he had heard banging and then her screaming and that’s when he called the emergency services. It’s just shocking that a young girl could die like this.'

A third said: 'When we heard the sirens, we just thought it was a chip pan fire and it would get dealt with in half an hour.

Investigation: A Major Investigations Team is looking into claims she was feuding with a man

'Most of the street were out when I came outside. I could not believe how bad it was.

'I don’t know how the firefighters could go in, it was so intense. The flames were coming out of the windows.

'We waited and thought we would see a rescue, but nobody came out.'

Lancashire Police said: 'The death is 
being treated as unexplained because we do not know how the fire 
started. The fire has caused extensive damage to the house and an 
investigation is now underway to establish what happened.

'A team of officers are working on the investigation, including officers from the Force Major Investigation Team.'

A spokesman for Lancashire Fire and Rescue Service said: 'The cause is the fire currently unknown and a joint investigation between us and the police has been launched.'
