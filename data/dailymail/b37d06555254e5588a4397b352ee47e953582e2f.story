England's plans for the Calcutta Cup showdown with Scotland have been undermined by yet another midfield injury – as Brad Barritt limped out of Saracens’ win at Wasps on Sunday. 

In the 58th minute of the Aviva Premiership encounter, the 28-year-old was contesting a high kick but landed awkwardly and his right leg bent backwards as home fly-half Andy Goode  landed on it.

He was treated on the field before being helped off. Initial indications were that Barritt had suffered a medial ligament strain in his knee, but that early prognosis soon changed.

Barritt's injury after Andy Goode landed on his leg initially seemed to be to his knee, but was to his ankle

After his side’s 26-17 comeback win, Saracens’ director of rugby, Mark McCall, said: ‘It seems to be his ankle. The knee seems to be okay. We’re all hopeful it won’t be too serious. 

'It didn’t look very good and Brad has been unlucky this season. I’m sure he’ll be close to selection for England next weekend, so fingers crossed it’s not as bad as it looked.’

Barritt was due to join up with the rest of the England squad at their Surrey HQ on Sunday night and he will face urgent medical assessments on Monday, as the coaches wait to discover if he will be available for Saturday’s RBS Six Nations clash with the Scots at Twickenham. 

With Luther Burrell of Northampton unable to train last week due to a calf strain, Barritt was seemingly destined for a recall at inside centre, but now his hopes hang in the balance.

The Saracen was an heroic mainstay of England’s autumn victory over Australia in his last Test appearance, but a calf injury in that game kept him out for a month, then he damaged knee ligaments in his clubs’ European Champions Cup tie against Clermont Auvergne in France. 

That untimely setback meant Barritt was unable to retain the national No 12 shirt, as he surely would have done if he had come through that pre-championship weekend unscathed.

Stuart Lancaster, England’s head coach, will hope that if Barritt isn’t cleared for a return against Scotland, Burrell does recover in time. The alternative option would be to pick Billy Twelvetrees at inside centre, but the Gloucester captain’s form has been alarmingly inconsistent this season.

If Barritt is fit to play, he is set to rejoin the back line along with Harlequins full-back Mike Brown – despite Alex Goode’s superb efforts at No 10 for Saracens yesterday. Up front, Northampton lock Courtney Lawes is expected to come into the second row in place of George Kruis.
