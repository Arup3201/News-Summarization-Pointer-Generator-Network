She spends her time on TV hobnobbing with the great and good as the Dowager Countess of Downton Abbey.

Now in real life, Dame Maggie Smith is to be made a Companion of Honour by the Queen, according to reports last night.

The Sun reported the veteran actress, 79, is due to receive the gong in the Queen’s Birthday Honours' List, which is published tomorrow.

The award, one of Britain's top honours, is in recognition of her extraordinary stage, film and TV career over six decades.

Most recently, she played a major part in making the ITV drama series a global phenomenon by playing its strongest character, the acid-tongued Dowager Countess of Grantham.

Companion of Honour awards were founded by the Queen’s grandfather, King George, in June 1917 in recognition of outstanding achievements in the arts, science and politics and are strictly limited to just 47 Brits at any one time, plus the monarch.

New admissions come only with another's death and the Queen is understood to have major say in who is given the gong.

Microbiologist Anthony Pawson was made a member of the select group in 2006 but died last year at the age of 60.

The honour carries no title, but allows holders to use the letters 'CH' after their names.

The award has previous been given to fellow veteran actress Dame Judi Dench, Olympics star Lord Coe and actor Sir Ian McKellen.

After making her stage debut in 1952, Dame Maggie has started in over 50 films. She has scooped two Oscars, five BAFTAs and two Golden Globes for roles in movies as varied as 1969's The Prime of Miss Jean Brodie to 1986’s A Room with a View.

Dame Maggie was given a CBE in 1970 and made a Dame in 1990.

Both the Cabinet Office and Dame Maggie Smith's representatives have declined to comment.

Dame Maggie also starred alongside Whoopi Goldberg in the 1993 blockbuster Sister Act
