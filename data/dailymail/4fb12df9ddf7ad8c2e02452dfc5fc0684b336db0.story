A railway worker who leapt on to the track to help rescue a disabled woman may face the sack for breaching health and safety rules.

Customer service assistant Alan Chittock was on the platform when he saw the elderly passenger roll 5ft down on to the line in her wheelchair.

With a commuter train due in minutes, he and three helpers jumped on to the track as other staff tried to alert signallers.

Customer service assistant Alan Chittock has been suspended for leaping onto the tracks at Southend Central railway station to rescue a disabled woman who had fallen from the platform

They lifted the woman, who was in her 70s and strapped into the chair, back on to the platform before the train arrived.

It
is not clear whether it could have been stopped in time if the woman 
had not been rescued. She was taken to hospital with her carer and 
treated for minor injuries.

Passengers
and colleagues congratulated Mr Chittock, 50. But rather than receive a
bravery award, he has been suspended by rail operator c2c while the 
incident is investigated – and could face disciplinary action for not 
following the ‘correct safety procedures’.

It is not clear whether he was on or off duty at the time of the incident at Southend Central Station.

Mr
Chittock, who has worked on the railways for about 30 years, declined 
to comment last night and is believed to have been advised by the RMT 
union not to talk about the incident.

But his sister, who did not want to be named, said he had no regrets.

‘He
had no choice,’ she said. ‘He did what any person in his situation 
would have done. The train was so close that it would have killed her 
had he not acted quickly. He wasn’t going to stand back.’

A rail worker, who asked not to be named, said: ‘He was suspended because staff can’t go on the tracks.

c2c, which operates trains service between London, Tilbury and Southend, suspended the employee for failing to follow the correct 'safety procedures'

‘He saved her life, but now he might lose his job. What was he supposed to do? Let her die?’

Commuter
Matt Findlay, 29, said: ‘Do the company really expect staff to leave 
people on the tracks? What he did was really brave. He deserves a medal 
not a suspension.’

Brian 
Cassar, 22, who works at the station cafe, said: ‘The woman just rolled 
off the platform edge. This guy immediately jumped down on to the track.
She probably would have got hurt if he hadn’t got involved.’

c2c is reviewing the incident on the London-bound platform at 6.10pm on August 28.

Although
the line, from Tilbury in Essex to Fenchurch Street, is powered by 
overhead cables, staff are banned from ‘accessing the track’ under 
health and safety rules even though there is no electrocution risk.

RMT
general secretary Bob Crow said: ‘Clearly it is a travesty of justice 
that a member of staff has ended up threatened with disciplinary action 
for helping avoid a potential tragedy.’

‘RMT
will do all that we can to ensure that he is returned to work as soon 
as possible with no stain on his record and a recognition that 
station-based rail staff play a crucial role in ensuring public safety.’

A
c2c spokesman said: ‘We have strict rules regarding correct safety 
procedures and an employee has been suspended while our investigations 
into the incident continue.’
