Vice President Joe Biden has spent more than a million dollars of taxpayers' money taking weekend and day trips to his home in Wilmington, Delaware, according a new book.

Dubbed the 'Wilmington Shuttle' by Secret Service agents and Air Force on the Vice President's service, a new book by New York Times bestselling author Ron Kessler alleges that Biden once made a same-day trip to and from Wilmington so he could play golf with the president.

The recorded cost of that trip alone was $12,406, Kessler writes in a chapter of his not-yet-released book The First Family Detail.

'Wilmington Shuttle': A new book claims Vice President Joe Biden, pictured here in April, uses Air Force Two and Marine Two like a taxi service and wastes thousands of taxpayer dollars on unnecessary trips to and from his home in Wilmington, Delaware

The book, The First Family Detail, comes out on August 5

In The 
First Family Detail, Kessler, an award winning investigative journalist,
 dishes on several of Biden's dirty little secrets, including his 
affinity for skinny dipping and for taking private trips on his taxpayer funded helicopter and plane 'as if taking a taxi.'

Kessler claims a Secret Service agent told him that every Friday Biden takes the Marine Two helicopter to Joint Base Andrews in Maryland, where he boards Air Force Two and flies home to Delaware. He then retraces his steps and goes back to Washington, D.C. at the end of the weekend.

'The cost of the flights is doubled because after dropping him off in Delaware or picking him up at Andrews, the Air Force has to fly the plane empty,' Kessler explains.

Biden frequently makes same-day trips on the plane as well, a Secret Service agent reportedly told Kessler.

' "The Air Force Two guys pull their hair out over this," ' Kessler quotes the agent as having said.

One such same-day trip allegedly took place on Friday, February 8, 2013.

Biden's official public schedule has him receiving the presidential daily briefing  with President Barack Obama at 10:30 a.m.and having lunch with Obama at 1 p.m. There's nothing else on his schedule after that and no news reports documenting any public appearances from that day, suggesting that Biden may very well have been in Wilmington at some point.

Because Biden has to be on the flight for the Air Force to pay for it, he will sometimes make the trip from Washington to Wilmington just to pick up his wife, Dr. Jill Biden, and take her back to D.C. with him, a Secret Service agent told Kessler.

Biden also schedules one-off events in Arizona so he can take taxpayer funded trips to The Grand Canyon State to play golf with his family, the agent claimed.

Kessler says the Secret Service agent told him Biden's most eyebrow raising waste of government resources is when he travels to Wilmington then jets back to Andrews the next morning to play a five-hour golf with Obama.

' "Every three of four weeks when it's warm, Biden gets up there on Saturday and then will fly back on Air Force Two," Kessler claims the agent told him. ' "While Air Force Two is sitting on the tarmac at Andrews, he goes and plays golf with the president at Andrew Air Force Base, gets back on the plane, and flies back to Delaware.

' "Let me tell you something, that is egregious," ' he said.

Kessler alleges that he filed a Freedom of Information Act request in 2013 to get exact numbers on the dates of Biden's trips, how many times the Air Force flew the plane empty to come pick Biden up or drop him off and the costs of travel. However, Biden's deputy counsel, Jessica R. Hertz, instructed the Air Force not to hand over the information to him, Kessler claims.

' "They are covering up," ' Kessler says an Air Force officer told him. ' "We spent a lot of time compiling the records, but Biden's office said logs for each flight would have to be consulted. This is a smokescreen to delay providing any records as long as possible." '

Kessler called the vice president's office's actions 'unprecedented' and contradictory to the president's order that his administration should 'apply a presumption of openness' in fulfilling such requests.

'Much like President Nixon's cover-ups, it is an effort to direct government officials to hide personal abuse,' he writes in The First Family Detail.

Kessler says he eventually received the information he was seeking from the Air Force and found out that Biden's trips to and from Delaware from the start of his first term as vice president through March of 2013 cost $979,680. And that amount is only for the fuel and maintenance of Air Force Two. It does not include the cost of fuel for Marine Two or the salaries of the helicopters crew.

Over the same time period, Kessler says the Air Force told him Biden flew back and forth from Wilmington to D.C. 225 times. Those trips actually required a total of 400 flights, though, because of what Kessler calls 'deadhead' trips - return flights when Biden was not on the plane.

The investigative journalist also found out that the total Air Force Two costs from Biden's personal trips in fiscal year 2012 were $288,080, and that an April 21, 2012, trip back to Andrews to play golf with Obama cost  the aforementioned $12,406.

Kessler's assertion is backed by similar reporting from long-time White House reporter Keith Koffler last year. Koffler estimated on his White House Dossier blog that Biden's weekend trips were running taxpayers $13,200 just for the Air Force Two flight costs.

In his report on Biden's non-stop travel to Wilmington, Koffler also questions the need for Biden to visit his home there so often.

Noting that Biden has family in Delaware and is a regular at an exclusive golf course in the area, Koffler points out that 'in an era of soaring debt' Biden was choosing 'to spend 
thousands of taxpayers dollars to accomodate a personal predilection.'

'Millions of American work in cities that they don’t call home, but 
few can afford the expense of returning to their ancestral grounds 
regularly,' Koffler wrote. 'And none can rest their heads on pillows at the beautiful vice president’s mansion at the U.S. Naval Observatory in Washington.'

Kessler says the irony of Biden's outrageous spending is that the president a put him in charge of the administration's Campaign to Cut waste in 2011 and claimed Biden would 'hunt down and eliminate misspent tax dollars in every agency and department across the federal government.'

Biden then told supporters of the administration in an email that he was the 'new sheriff in town,' Kessler noted.

In The First Family Detail author Ronald Kessler claims that Biden regularly travels to to Wilmington on Friday, returns to the D.C. area to play golf with President Barack Obama on Saturday, then flies back to Wilmington for the remainder of the weekend.

While Kessler and the Secret Service agent he spoke with characterized Biden's gas guzzling golf trips with the president as occurring frequently, a report from The Hill last month said the vice president had not played together for nearly a year.

The last time Obama was known to have gotten together with Biden out on the green was in August of 2013, The Hill stated.

Furthermore, Biden has said multiple times throughout his vice presidency that he would prefer to take the cheaper, Amtrak train service between Wilmington and D.C. like he did when he was a Senator, but the Secret Service won't let him because it 'gives too many opportunities for people to interact with me in a way they wouldn't like to see.'

It was only after last year's budget cutting sequester that Biden was able to convince the Secret Service to allow him to take the train again.

'I was able to 
say, "Look guys, I've got to take the train now -- it's cheaper than 
flying." So I get to take the train again,' Biden said at a National Association of Attorney's General event in February of 2013.

Still, Kessler says, the onus is on Biden for taking so many trips on the taxpayer's dime knowing just how much they were costing.

'While Secret 
Service agents say flying is the most secure way for Biden to make the 
trips, the question is why the sheriff who is supposed to cut out 
government waste thinks it is appropriate to take such frequent trips 
for personal reasons,' Kessler writes in The First Family Detail.

Likewise, the Secret Service 
agents and Air Force officers assigned to Biden's detail 'express 
outrage at what they consider an abuse,' he said.
