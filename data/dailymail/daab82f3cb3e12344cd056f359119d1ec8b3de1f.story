Snared: Stephen Johnson of the Miami Gardens Police was jailed Friday night during a prostitution sting by the Broward Sheriff's Office

A South Florida police chief has been arrested for allegedly soliciting two prostitutes.

Stephen Johnson of the Miami Gardens Police was jailed Friday night following an undercover sting by the Broward Sheriff's Office.

An arrest report says 53-year-old Johnson responded to an advertisement for escorts on a website and arranged for a liaison with two women at a Dania Beach motel. 

Once he handed over $100, detectives posing as prostitutes arrested him.

Johnson posted bond and was released early Saturday. 

He blamed his arrest on the pressures of his job, telling reporters, 'The stress overwhelmed me and I made a very bad decision.'

The top cop was immediately fired from the post he had held for less than a year in Miami Gardens, a suburb about halfway between Miami and Fort Lauderdale.

During the conversations, Johnson said he allegedly wanted to do 'everything'.

The undercover detectives also asked him if he had any special requests.

Johnson said he wanted the women to wear heels since he had a fetish for the footwear, according to the arrest affidavit seen by Local 10. 

He allegedly wanted a 30-minute session, which the detective said would cost $80.

After negotiating with the cop, the made him an offer of two women for $100.

Johnson then went to the unnamed motel and knocked on the door of the room where he believed he'd find the prostitute. He was then taken into custody after handing over the cash

Recently, Johnson, 53, has been dealing with the shooting death of a mentally ill man named Lavall Hall by police officer Eddo Trimino.
