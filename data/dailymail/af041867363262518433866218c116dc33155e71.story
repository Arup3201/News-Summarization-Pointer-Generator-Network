Today’s historic vote in the Mexican Congress opening the country's state-run oil industry to outside investors for the first time in 70 years was preceded by passionate debate, fisticuffs - and one legislator’s striptease. 

Antonio Garcia Conejo, a member of the leftist Democratic Revolution Party, stripped down to his underwear during a speech Wednesday to dramatize his assertion the bill is a ‘plunder of the nation.’

The 353-134 vote will allow the government to give private foreign and domestic companies contracts and licenses to explore and drill for oil and gas, deals now prohibited under Mexico's constitution.

No shame: Conejo proclaimed that he is not embarrassed to appear nearly nude on the floor of the chamber

The final step, approval by 17 of Mexico's 31 states, is widely seen as assured.

The state-run oil company, Petroleos Mexicanos, or Pemex, has had a monopoly since the government took over operations of foreign oil companies in 1938, a move that has been revered ever since as a symbol of national sovereignty.

Fear: Conejo and other opponents of the bill believe that multinationals, especially from the U.S., will regain the sort of domination they had over Mexico's oil before 1938

Opponents say they fear that multinationals, especially from the U.S., will once again regain the sort of domination they had over Mexico's oil before 1938. Mexico remains one of the top five crude exporters to the U.S., shipping more than 1million barrels a day.

Leftist lawmakers tried to block discussion of the measure on Wednesday by seizing the main chamber of the House of Deputies, blocking access with chairs and tables.

When the debate was moved to another room, they dragged out discussion for 20 hours before the measure was finally approved.

‘The homeland is not for sale! The homeland is to be defended!’ they shouted while holding protest signs and Mexican flags.

The proceedings took a strange turn when just before dawn Mr Garcia Conejo took the podium to protest the measuring, shedding his suit and tie.

Standing in a pair of black briefs on the dais, the chubby middle-aged lawmaker accused the ruling party of depleting the nation's assets by signing off on past privatizations of telecommunications.

'This is how you're stripping the nation. Where is the benefit?

‘How shameful! But this doesn’t embarrass me,’ he proclaimed. ‘You, too, have a body.’

Mexico news outlets and the BBC reported that political rivals Karen Quiroga on the left and Landy Berzunza on the right even came to blows during the tense session, with the latter landing in the hospital with a scratched retina.

Despite the protests, most oil analysts had a positive view of the bill hashed out by President Enrique Pena Nieto's Institutional Revolutionary Party and the conservative National Action Party.

They say major change is needed to rescue Mexico's moribund oil industry, where production has declined, and where Pemex hasn't had the finances or expertise needed to tap the country's vast deep-water and shale reserves.

While oil output has been rising in the U.S. and Canada, Mexico's production has fallen 25 per cent since 2004 despite increased investment.

According to Pemex statistics, the company has nearly 14billion barrels in proven reserves and up to 115billion barrels in prospective reserves, about half of which are in deep water or shale oil and gas.

‘The opening of Mexico's markets to put it bluntly, we believe is very good for the people of Mexico and the people everywhere in the world that uses energy,’ William Colton, Exxon Mobil's vice president of corporate strategic planning, said in a webcast before the vote Thursday. ‘It's win-win if there ever was one.’

Supporters say a better energy sector could add at least a full percentage point to Mexico's annual growth rate, which was scaled back dramatically this year from a projected 3.5 per cent to 1.3 per cent.

Backers also say it will be a boon to all three countries, the U.S., Canada and Mexico, in the North American Free Trade Agreement.

‘We are going to be able to develop services and competencies in dealing with energy that are transferrable from one country to another, ‘ Thomas Donohue, president of the U.S. Chamber of Commerce, told The Associated Press.

Barclays Research, part of the Corporate and Investment Banking division of Barclays Bank, says the process of boosting production will be slow. Pemex estimates it needs more than $60billion a year in investment to explore reserves, and currently gets about $24billion.

‘We have to recognize that this is an important effort in a historic sense. However, the challenges are huge because of the amount that has to be done to implement the reform as it is designed,’ said Michelle Michot Foss, head of the University of Texas' Center for Energy Economics.

The measure would allow contracts for profit- and production-sharing as well as licenses under which companies would pay royalties and taxes to the Mexican government for the right to explore and drill.

Private companies could post reserves as long as they specify in contracts that all oil and gas belongs to Mexico. The constitution would continue to prohibit oil concessions, considered the most liberal kind of access for private oil companies.

The bill also calls for mechanisms to prevent, detect and punish corruption in all new contracts, though the specifics must be worked out in what's known as the secondary laws.

It also appears to reduce the influence of the powerful oil union run by Carlos Romero Deschamps, whose family is famous for its ostentatious lifestyle.

Pemex has an estimated 155,000 employees, of which about 101,000 are unionized, according to Mexico's Center for Economic Investigation and Education.
