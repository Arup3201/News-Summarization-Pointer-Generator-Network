Former World Superbike racer Carl Fogarty has touched down in Australia after being revealed as a contestant on this year's I'm a Celebrity... Get Me Out of Here!

Fogarty, who won four world championships in the 1990s and is considered one of the most successful riders of all time, arrived in Brisbane on Sunday ahead of the return of the ITV show later this week.

And the 49-year-old, who was renowned for his speed attacking the corners, is set to swap the bike leathers to enter the world of Bush Tucker Trials.

It doesn't get much scarier than riding on two wheels at speeds of up to 200mph, but Fogarty's nerves will be put to a new test when faced with cockroaches and other jungle critters.

He will be joined in the jungle by Irish model Nadia Forde, who was earlier this year rumoured to be dating golfer Rory McIlroy.

The lingerie model also landed in Brisbane on Sunday ahead of the show and explained she is well prepared for life in the jungle.

The Irish model said on her arrival that she had come prepared by packing 'lots of bikinis'

'I'm looking forward to the challenge ahead and yes, I've packed lots of bikinis!' Forde said.

'The flight was really nice. I am a big fan of the show and I'm happy to be in Australia and love the sunshine.'

Former Wigan and Fulham midfielder Jimmy Bullard is also rumoured to be one of the celebrities ready to enter the jungle this week. 

There's little doubt that the retired Premier League star will be an entertaining addition to the hit ITV show.
