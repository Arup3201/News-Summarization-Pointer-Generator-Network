Canadian astronaut Chris Hadfield has praised the Hollywood blockbuster Gravity as being ‘visually just like being on a spacewalk’.

He did, however, have one bone to pick with Alfonso Cuaron's film. 

Specifically, Sandra Bullock’s underwear.

He claims a more realistic depiction would have placed her in adult nappies.

Chris Hadfield saw Alfonso Cuaron's Gravity movie and he thought it was well done, but added that for it to be realistic Sandra Bullock should have worn diapers

‘Inside our space suit, we’re wearing… a Halloween costume, which is a liquid cooling garment,’ Hadfield said on Conan O’Brien’s talk show.

‘And we’re wearing… kind of pull-up diapers. You come out and you’ve been sweating in there for eight hours, your hair looks like rat fur … you do not look like an underwear model.’

Hadfield added that the space walk in Gravity was ‘better than any space movie ever made’.

The astronaut, who was nine when Neil Armstrong became the first man to walk on the moon in 1969, is best known for his rendition of David Bowie’s Space Oddity while on the International Space Station.  

Earlier this year, the outspoken Canadian posted the first episode of his new show Chris Hadfield's Space Kitchen.

The first recipe was a tortilla filled with honey and peanut butter.

'In the early days of space exploration, food was mostly squeezed out of tubes,' said Hadfield in the video.

'But now, we have all kinds of things we eat on Earth.'

In his book, An Astronaut’s Guide To Life On Earth by, he elaborates on day-to-day life in space.

For instance, there’s no running water on the space station - you need gravity for that - so astronauts use wet wipes and no-rinse shampoo to wash themselves.

They also sweat less, and clothes don’t cling to the skin in the same way, so don’t tend to smell as bad.

‘A pair of socks lasted me a week, a shirt was good for two weeks, and shorts and long pants could be worn for a month without unpleasant social consequences,’ he said.

This is because astronauts have to wear pants similar to 'pull-up' nappies
