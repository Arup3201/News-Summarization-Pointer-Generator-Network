The bugle that sounded the catastrophic orders for the Charge of the Light Brigade has emerged on TV’s Antiques Roadshow.

The instrument was carried into the suicidal battle of the Crimea War in 1854 by Private William Brittain, Lord Cardigan’s duty trumpeter.

He took orders directly from Lord Cardigan, who led the cavalry, and blew on his bugle several times to signal the men to walk, canter, trot and charge at the Russian guns.

Historic: The bugle that sounded the catastrophic orders for the Charge of the Light Brigade where 245 men were injured has emerged on TV's Antiques Roadshow

Damage: The instrument, pictured above showing a cleave made by a Russian Cossack's lance, would have been carried and played by Private William Brittain at the time of battle

Some 673 cavalrymen headed into what became known as the ‘Valley of Death’ and were mercilessly cut down by the Russians. There were 245 casualties which included 118 dead.

Trumpeter Brittain was mortally wounded in the battle and taken to the same hospital where Florence Nightingale served, along with his trusty instrument.

He later died from his wounds and the bugle was given to his family.

It was bought at auction by a publican from Newcastle in the early 20th century and then donated to the Queens Royal Lancers and Nottinghamshire Yeomanry Museum in 1964.

A large hole on its horn end is said to have been caused by a Russian Cossack who used his lance to try and cut the bugle from Brittain but was unsuccessful.

Captain Nick Holtby, the curator of the museum, took the brass instrument along to a recent Antique’s Roadshow event.

Although the value of it cannot be given ahead of this Sunday’s show on BBC1, it is worth many thousands of pounds.

Bill Merriman, from the Antiques Roadshow, said: 'This is a fantastic piece of iconic British military history.

'You can reach out and actually touch history with this and it’s fantastic.'

The Charge of the Light Brigade was the bloodiest of the 1854 Crimean War.

The charge was part of the Battle of Balaclava on 25 October.

On the fateful day, Brittain - instructed by Lord Cardigan - would have signaled for the cavalry to walk down into the so-called 'Valley of Death'.

He then sounded the bugle for charge, taking the men further into the valley where they were cut down by the Russians.

There were 245 casualties, which included 118 dead.

According to some sources, the massacre can be blamed on confusion surrounding the order to attack and the relationship between George Bingham GCB, the 3rd Earl of Lucan and Lord Cardigan.

The two didn't like each other - which made for turbulent working conditions.

Trumpeter Brittain was mortally 
wounded and taken to Florence 
Nightingale's hospital. He later died from his wounds.

The bugle, which the Private had taken to hospital with him, was given to his family following his death.

It
 was bought at auction by a publican from Newcastle in the early 20th 
century before being pass on the actor Laurence Harvey.

It was then donated to the Queens Royal Lancers and Nottinghamshire
 Yeomanry Museum in 1964.

The massacre at Balaclava in the Crimea was blamed on the relationship between Field Marshall George Bingham GCB, the 3rd Earl of Lucan, who was in overall command, and his brother-in-law, Lord Cardigan.

The two men didn’t like each other which led to confusion surrounding the order to attack.

Capt Holtby said: 'William Brittain was Lord Cardigan’s duty trumpeter on the day of the charge.

'When Cardigan gave the fateful order to go down the valley it would have been for the cavalry to walk.

'William Brittain raised this bugle and his signal was picked up by other trumpeters in the other regiments and they relayed the call.

'It started off as an advanced walk and Brittain then sounded the bugle for canter and then the charge.

'He was unhorsed and badly wounded by the last volley fired by the Don Cossack battery.

'He was picked up by comrades who started the retreat and brought him back to the British lines.

'He was taken to Scutari where he was nursed by Florence Nightingale but sadly died.

'But the kept remained with him all the time and that was passed to his family.'

In the 1960s the bugle was sold at auction and bought by the actor Laurence Harvey, who was hoping to star in a film of the charge.

He presented it to the museum in 1964.

Capt Holtby said: 'It is a bit battered and it does have a hole in it from where a Russian lancer tried to pick it up off the floor but failed.'

Viewers of the Antiques Roadshow will see Capt Holtby blow the bugle to signal the end of Sunday’s show.
