One mother in San Antonio, Texas made the ultimate sacrifice, offering her life to save those of her two young children when an oncoming car threatened to hit them.

28-year-old single mother Sharon Ledesma was walking her son Dominic, 11, and daughter Mallory, 8, to their grandmother's house early Wednesday morning around 7am, when it was still dark outside.

The young family was more than halfway across Culebra Road when they stepped off a median and into the path of a car turning left.

Sacrifice: 28-year-old single mother Sharon Ledesma died Thursday night after being taken off life support. She was hit by a car early Wednesday morning and helped save the lives of her two young children by pushing them out of the way

Crash: The accident scene shows that the young family wasn't using a crosswalk when they were struck by the car. Their belongings are pictured scattered on the road

A mother's reaction: Ledesma pushed the two children out of the way and was hit the hardest by the car, police officers said

Ledesma then pushed her two children out of the way and was hit with the brunt of the force from the oncoming car, according to police officers on the scene.

Dominic suffered a broken collarbone and Mallory a fractured pelvis but both are recovering fine thanks to the protection of their mother.

'She must have protected Mallory and Dominic,' her sister Priscilla Ledesma told KENS 5. 'I'm proud of my sister for doing that, but what mother wouldn't do that for her kids'.

Family: A picture from Ledesma's Facebook profile seems to show her with her children. 11-year-old Dominic and 8-year-old Mallory were also injured in the accident, but are recovering fine

Last goodbye: Ledesma was kept on life support so that her organs could be donated after she died. Her children said one last goodbye to their mother Thursday before she was taken off life support

Ledesma herself was not so lucky. Doctors couldn't revive her, so she was put on life support so her organs could be donated.

'We were just hoping for the best and she just never came out of it. So we decided as a family that it's time,' Priscilla Ledesma told KABB.

Tough decision: Ledesma's sister Priscilla said the family decided to take the young mother off of life support Thursday

Honoring: A large group of Ledesma's friends and family gathered at the site where she was hit for a candlelight vigil in her honor Thursday night

That happened Thursday night, just as Dominic was going into surgery for his collarbone. The children were brought in for one last moment with their mom before she passed away.

'It was very, very difficult for the kids,' Ledesma's grandmother Josie Inouye, 67, told the San Antonio Express-News. 'Dominic, he took it so hard'.

The rest of Ledesma's family and friends heard about her passing at a candlelight vigil in her honor that night.

No charges are expected to be filed against the driver of the car that killed Ledesma. In a video report for KABB, the woman looked visibally torn up over the incident, sobbing as she talked to a police officer.

An accident: Local news station KABB showed footage of a woman sobbing to a police officer, who they inferred was the driver of the vehicle that hit Ledesma and her two children. No charges are expected to be filed against her

'We're not blaming her, it was just an accident. She [doesn't] have to blame herself ' said Larry Diaz, one of Ledesma's family members.

As of Friday, Mallory had been released from the hospital and her brother is also doing fine, recovering from his surgery.

Ledesma's family is now fundraising to pay their medical bills and for a funeral since she was uninsured.
