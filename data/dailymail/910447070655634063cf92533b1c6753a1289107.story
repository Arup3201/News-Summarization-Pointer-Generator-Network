Cristiano Ronaldo is used to seeing people wearing Real Madrid and Portugal shirts with his name on - and the 29-year-old's latest business venture will see his fans have the CR7 brand on their feet too.

The Madrid forward revealed his latest project, a line of premium shoes, via his Facebook page, which has more than 93million 'likes'.

Available from February, according to the website the footwear range is based on Ronaldo's identity, image and behaviour, and aimed at people with a 'relaxed and casual lifestyle'.

The shoes, which will be produced in Ronaldo's native Portugal, will include embossed Cristiano Ronaldo logos on leather and CR7 printed on to rubber soles.

The Portugal captain has joined up with his Madrid team-mates for their pre-season tour of the US after his country's poor showing at the World Cup. 

It was his first day back on Monday following a disappointing World Cup campaign that saw him score just a single goal as Portugal exited at the group stage.

He was greeted by hundreds of fans at their LA training base before undergoing what looked like a light session separate to the rest of the squad.VIDEO Scroll down to watch Ronaldo meet Juventus legend Alessandro Del Piero
