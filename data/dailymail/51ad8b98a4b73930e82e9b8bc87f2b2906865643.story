Retirement is meant to be about getting out the pipe and slippers.

77-year-old Gao Yinyu appears to have understood the slippers bit but there is certainly no sign of a pipe as he balances like a gymnast on the frozen parallel bars in -25°c as part of his daily exercise regime.

Amazingly since starting the workout more than ten years ago, the retired teacher from Jilin, in north eastern China, says he has rarely caught a cold.

Freezing: 77-year-old retired teacher Gao Yinyu from Jilin, in northeastern China, has exercised like this everyday for more than a decade. The only reason he wears gloves is to stop sticking to the frozen bars

Straighten that back: Gao Yinyu pulls his legs up to the horizontal position and crunches those abs. That back could be a bit straighter though. 7/10

Slippers together: Gao Yinyu drops the legs and lifts them out behind him, transferring weight on to his arms. Great symmetry. 8/10

Brain freeze:  Incredible balance shown by Gao Yinyu as he headstands on a snow covered stone. That's one way to wake you up in the morning. Those legs should really be pulled in together though. 6/10

He starts his regime with a light jog to get the blood pumping, then he does some lifts on the parallel bars and finishes off with a dip in the frozen water.

Mr Yinyu said that he does morning exercises all year round since retiringand and has never missed a day. Chinese male employees usually 
retire at the age of 60. 

The images are reminiscent of the YouTube video and images posted online earlier this year of a 4-year Chinese boy jogging and doing press-ups in the snow.

The boy's father, who was behind the exercise regime said his son was born several months premature and doctors 
worried he might suffer development difficulties so came up with a harsh regime to 
build the boy’s strength and mental toughness

The clip begins with a shot of the boy, named as Ho Yide, standing in the snow in clear distress.

He is then shown walking, fists 
clenched against the cold, past parked cars covered in several inches of
snow. At one point he begs: ‘Please give me a hug.’

Chin up: Agile Gao Yinyu swings round the bars like a 21-year-old gymnast. 9/10

Fit as a butcher's dog: Not an ounce of fat on Gao Yinyu as he lifts himself up on the bars to display perfect symmetry. 9/10

Headrush: Once again, Gao Yinyu goes for the headstand as the sun comes up in the distance. Legs could go a good six inches further back though. 5/10

Clearing the path : Gao Yinyu finally gets into something a bit warmer to prepare the jetty for his final exercise of the morning

His mother can apparently be heard 
laughing and encouraging him to endure the icy ordeal. One viewer wrote:
‘The child would be better off in care. This father is a monster.’

But online comments from a woman 
described as the father’s assistant said the child had agreed to run in 
the snow: ‘This child has received all sorts of forms of  training since
he was small.’

She said the father ‘doesn’t care what others say’, adding: ‘The fact that the child lived shows he has tenacious vitality.’

Cooling off time: : Gao Yinyu peels off the pants and prepares to get into the frozen water, no doubt it will cool him right down after that workout

Sub-zero: Gao Yinyu finishes his routine with a quick dip in the water. Full marks. 10/10
