Justin Bieber has spoken for the first time about allegations he fathered a fan's four-month-old child.

Mariah Yeater, 20, claims in court filings that the star father her son Tristyn during a 30-second sex session in a bathroom backstage after one of his shows.

She now wants to force the 17-year-old to take a DNA test and pay up to $260,000 in monthly child support.

'I would just like to say basically that none of those allegations are true,' he told the Today Show.

'I know that I'm going to be a target but I'm never going to be a victim.'

Not true: Addressing the allegations for the first time, Justin Bieber told the Today Show, he did not sleep with a fan and is not the father of her three-month-old child

He continued: 'I think it's crazy because every night 
after the show I'm gone, right from the stage to my car so it's crazy 
that some people want to make up such false allegations but to set the 
record straight, none of it is true.'

When host Matt Lauer asked if he had met Mariah, he said: 'Never met the woman.'

It has been claimed that the Yeater told her ex-boyfriend he was the father last year, but he denied he got her pregnant.

According to Frances Lippe who told TMZ that Mariah had been dating her grandson John Terranova in Las Vegas toward the end of high school.

According to the gossip website 
Mariah told John that he was the father and the pair got into a fight 
after he denied her allegations.

Yeater was arrested and charged with battery, according to TMZ because she had hit John in the face. 

The family have said they haven't heard from Ms Yeater since.

Meanwhile despite Yeater's allegations about Bieber, the Today 
set was swamped with excited fans, some who had lined up the night 
before to get a glimpse of the star.

Justin, who is dating popstar Selena Gomez, smiled happily and signed autographs for the crowd.

And he was obviously please with how his side of the story came across.

Telling my side of the story: The 17-year-old still had plenty of fans who came to the set equipped with posters despite the allegations

The
star tweeted soon after his appearance saying: 'Thanks for letting me 
set the record straight. what is real are my fans...this album...and 
this charity work. see u guys the 23rd.'

Still, Yeater now faces a possible 
investigation for 'statutory rape' because singer was under age at the 
time she claimed they had sex.

Yesterday, a Los Angeles police commander said that his department may look into the allegations.

The law states any person 'who engages in an act of unlawful sexual 
intercourse with a minor who is not more than three years older or three
years younger than the perpetrator, is guilty of a misdemeanor.'

At the time of the alleged encounter, Yeater had only just turned 19.

According to Associated Press, Cmdr. 
Andrew Smith said that no report has yet been taken about the incident, 
which allegedly occurred last October at the Staples Centre.

But that doesn't mean police won't 
take action, given that it's been reported that Yeater is filing a 
paternity suit against the young pop star.

It has also emerged that she considered giving the boy up for adoption before instead going public with her Bieber bombshell.

'She didn't know if she was going to 
keep him,' said Samra Fae Stepper, a relative who looked after Yeater 
for several months during her pregnancy.

'We kept asking about the father, but I didn't press it.'

Stepper's mother, Frances Wilson, said: 'I did ask her if she was going to keep the baby. She said she didn't know.

'I don't think she knew until almost when the baby was born.'

Wilson said Yeater had told her, 'I'm
pretty sure I know who he is,' referring to the father. 'But she said 
she wasn't going to tell him.'

Yeater's stepfather, Anthony 
Simeonoff, only found out news of the baby's supposed dad this Thursday 
after friends at his local club read the headlines.

'I'm still in shock,' Simeonoff said,
adding that he believes Yeater. 'I love my grandson. If it's real or 
not, I love my grandson.'

Meanwhile, The New York Post reports that Yeater was arrested in Las Vegas less than two months after getting knocked up.

Records state that on December 21, 2010, Yeater committed battery by 'slapping' a man in the face and later pleaded not guilty.

On June 16, Yeater's lawyer asked for
a continuance, noting she lived out of state and was 'under doctor's 
orders not to travel due to high-risk pregnancy.'

Yeater, from California, claimed in
an affidavit that a security guard working for Bieber 
approached her and ‘asked if I wanted to meet Justin Bieber’ before 
shepherding her backstage.

‘After waiting for a short period of 
time with several young women, Justin Bieber appeared and engaged me in 
conversation,’ Yeater reportedly said.

‘Immediately, it was obvious that we 
were mutually attracted to one another, and we began to kiss. Shortly 
thereafter, Justin Bieber suggested that I go with him to a private 
place where we could  be alone.

‘I agreed… and on the walk to a private area, he told me he wanted to make love to me and this was going to be his first time.

She said he led her to a bathroom where ‘immediately his personality changed drastically’.

She
allegedly claimed: ‘He began touching me ... at the time I asked him to
put a condom on for protection, but he insisted that he did not want 
to.’

Meanwhile, pictures of Mariah have emerged that show off her tattoos, piercings and her willingness to strip off.

She is seen showing off her nose and lip piercings in one shot while in another she shows off two star tattoos on her pelvis.

She is seen in another shot cupping her breasts showing off her naval piercing and her tattoos below her waistline.

In more revealing images she shows 
off two bow tattoos on her back, while she is seen in another picture 
make a rude gesture into the camera.

The
new pictures also show Ms Yeater’s playful side as she poses showing 
off the peace sign while her face is wrapped up in cello tape.

Bieber's fans who are known as Beliebers
have reacted badly to the news and Yeater has been the subject of death
threats from fans.

One fan on Twitter posted: 'I could kill this b****, really she messes with my baby!!! SHE IS SOOO DEAD.'

Mariah's grandfather has also spoken out.

Eddie Markouse has told The New York Daily News that Mariah is a 'honest, good person'.

'I don't know the whole story. But, from what I understood, she met him at a concert and he sent two security guards down off of the state to bring her backstage to meet him,' Markhouse said.

'She's basically an honest good person. She's got a big heart. She's a good kid and she loves this baby.'
