An endoscopy revealed MP Mike Weatherley's heartburn was in fact oesophageal cancer

MP Mike Weatherley was out for dinner with friends when, inexplicably, he found himself struggling to swallow. 

‘It felt as if the food was catching on the way down,’ says the Conservative member for Hove and Portslade in East Sussex.

‘After a few mouthfuls I realised it wasn’t going to budge and I had to run to the toilet and throw up.’

Initially, he put it down to a bug, but over the next week it happened again and again.

‘Soup was fine but anything tougher, such as steak, would feel as if it was catching,’ says Mike, 57, who is divorced and has three children aged 27, 25 and 22.

‘I was not overly concerned; I thought I was a relatively healthy person, I don’t smoke and I play sport. 

'Being a Parliamentarian, however, brings with it an unhealthy lifestyle — I often would not eat until midnight and I drink a bit more than the official guidelines. But I thought, on balance, I was in pretty good shape.’

His only complaint was the odd bit of heartburn. 

But he thought that was a common problem and nothing to worry about. 

However, in December 2011, after three weeks with no improvement, he realised it was time to see his doctor.

She thought it might be acid indigestion or reflux and prescribed some strong antacids, which didn’t help. She also referred Mike for an endoscopy, when a camera attached to a tube is fed down the throat.

He had the investigation five weeks later which found he had a growth bulging across his oesophagus, the pipe that carries food from the mouth to the stomach. Tests revealed it was cancer.

‘I felt as if the floor had dropped away,’ he says. ‘I thought: “That’s it, I’m going to die.” 

'I was thinking of my three children, and how I wouldn’t see them go on to establish their own families and I’d never meet my grandchildren.’

Oesophageal cancer is becoming increasingly common. Between 1977 and 2011, the number of cases soared — by 65 per cent in men and 26 per cent in women, according to Cancer Research UK.

‘No other country in Europe has a higher incidence of this cancer than we do,’ says Michael Griffin, professor of gastrointestinal surgery at the Royal Victoria Infirmary, Newcastle.

We have the highest incidence of the most common form of oesophageal cancer — called adenocarcinoma — in the world, he adds. This is thought to be linked to our high rates of obesity and alcohol intake.

The prognosis is often poor: only 40 per cent of patients are alive 12 months after their diagnosis.

‘There is a very low survival rate for this cancer,’ says Tom Stansfeld, health information officer at Cancer Research UK. ‘After ten years, there is only a 10 per cent survival rate, whereas with breast or testicular cancer the rate is 80 to 90 per cent.’ 

One of the main problems is that people aren’t aware of the symptoms, so the cancer is not picked up until it is too late.

Research for Public Health England found 70 per cent had no idea that food sticking in your throat could be a sign of oesophageal or stomach cancer; 59 per cent were not aware persistent heartburn was a sign, too. In fact, heartburn isn’t just a symptom of oesophageal cancer, it’s also the cause in most cases.

Heartburn occurs when the acidic contents of the stomach splash up the oesophagus; being overweight encourages this, putting pressure on the stomach.

Over years the splashed acid can cause changes to the type of cells lining the oesophagus and they become pre-cancerous, known as Barrett’s oesophagus. About 6 per cent of those with Barrett’s go on to develop oesophageal cancer.

Oesophageal cancer is also linked to a diet low in fruit and vegetables, and to smoking and drinking — possibly because these irritate the cells that line the oesophagus. It can also run in families.

Men are three times more likely to develop adenocarcinoma — the most common type — than women. Why is unclear, but one theory is the female oesophagus is more resistant to damage, says Professor Griffin.

The problem is that many people, like Mike, think heartburn is ‘just one of those things’. ‘I had it once or more a week for a year before my diagnosis and thought everyone got a bit of heartburn. I would take Gaviscon and not think any more of it,’ he admits.

Professor Griffin says occasional heartburn a few times a month is acceptable, but adds: ‘Persistent heartburn is not normal.’ Public Health England has launched a campaign encouraging people to visit their GP if they have heartburn most days for three weeks or more.

Yet, Mike believes the situation could be helped by improving access to GPs. Last month, he made a speech to the Commons asking the Health Minister to consider this.

‘If I need to see a GP I have to ring during this narrow window between 8am to 8.10am to try to secure an appointment for that day,’ he says. ‘I think that means people put off going and getting their symptoms checked, as I did.’

If the disease is caught at an early stage, pre-cancerous or even cancerous cells can simply be burned or cut away. However, when it is more advanced, the usual option is to remove the oesophagus almost in its entirety.

The stomach is then moved up and a section of the oesophagus that is left will be attached to it.

‘It is the most high-risk elective surgery there is, as you have to open the abdomen and the chest, which is major trauma for the body. It’s like going through a car crash,’ says Professor Griffin.

He says only a third of the patients referred to him are eligible even to try ‘curative’ treatment as, once diagnosed, their cancer is often too advanced and they are too frail. Mike’s biopsy was not conclusive, but the fact he had a mass there convinced surgeons it was best to remove most of his oesophagus.

He had the operation in April 2012. ‘I was happy to trust the surgeon’s advice, although I didn’t realise just how major an operation it would be,’ says Mike.

‘Afterwards they give you a button you can push to administer yourself some morphine and their notes showed I pushed mine 535 times the first day.’

For three weeks, he was fed through a tube directly into his stomach. A week after the operation he was told the mass was a grade III cancer, meaning it was aggressive and had spread to nearby lymph nodes.

‘I’d wanted to delay the operation until July. Thank goodness I didn’t, as if I had, I’d be dead now,’ says Mike bluntly.

He needed six weeks of radiotherapy followed by chemotherapy for five months. Mike now wishes he had gone to his GP sooner as he might not have needed such major treatment.

Yet, Professor Griffin says, even those who do go to their GP may have their diagnosis held up because they will not get an endoscopy soon enough.

‘If someone is suspected of having cancer then they should have one within two weeks. But often these people aren’t referred with suspected cancer, as it might be heartburn, and they can wait for up to 18 weeks,’ he says.

For Mike, life has changed. He gets tired easily and whereas he used to look forward to meals out with his girlfriend, Niki, much of the joy of eating has gone for him.

Certain foods such as risotto or anything stodgy are off-limits as it can get caught in the new connection between his stomach and what remains of his oesophagus. He is more prone to reflux, so takes omeprazole — which reduces stomach acid production — every day, and has regular scans.

‘I had my last one on Thursday and it came back all-clear, so I am now officially in remission,’ he says, relief evident in his voice.

Mike is optimistic about the future and is standing down as an MP in May.

But he is certain of his commitment to help others avoid what he’s been through: ‘If I can at least get one person to go to the doctor sooner than they would have done, then I will be pleased.’
