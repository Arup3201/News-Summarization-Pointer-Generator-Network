Chelsea are ready to offer Eden Hazard a bumper pay rise to keep him from Paris St Germain's clutches.

PSG manager Laurent Blanc has spoken publicly about his desire to bring the Belgium international to the French capital next season.

Discreet overtures between Hazard's representatives and officials at the mega-rich Ligue 1 club have already taken place.

But the Blues will look to ward off interest from France by handing the exciting forward a new deal - that will see his current £170,000-per-week deal rise to nearer £200,000.

His current contract still has three years left to run, and Chelsea hope the statement of intent of extended terms will be enough to keep Hazard at Stamford Bridge.

However, that is unlikely to keep PSG from pursuing Hazard this summer as they plot a huge £61million bid.

The Parisien club are convinced Hazard is obtainable this summer and that Chelsea are willing to do business at the right price.

Chelsea have given Hazard the coveted No 10 shirt to wear next season, a further indication of their determination to the forward.
