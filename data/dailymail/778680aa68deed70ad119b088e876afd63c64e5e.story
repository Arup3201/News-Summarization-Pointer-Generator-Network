David Cameron said he had paid cash for work but not so the trader could avoid tax

David Cameron today waded into the row over cash-in-hand work - insisting it was okay not to ask for a receipt because the 'onus' was not on tragers to pay their tax.

A spokeswoman for the Prime Minister said he had occasionally paid for goods and services in cash without getting a receipt, but insists that he has never helped someone 'evade the taxes that they should pay'.

She added: 'If you have one-off payments for something, you may well pay cash. The onus is on the trader, who is responsible for making sure they pay the taxes that they owe.'

Mr Cameron's intervention came after Labour's shadow business secretary Chuka Umunna said getting a receipt for all cash-in-hand jobs was a 'matter of good housekeeping' and was a 'good thing to do'.

Mr Umunna's remarks were in response to the controversy sparked by Labour's shadow chancellor Ed Balls who said families had a duty document how much they pay every time they get their hedge trimmed.

Mr Balls said people had a duty to demand receipts for the smallest cash jobs carried out by gardeners, cleaners and handymen.

But Mr Umunna this morning defended the shadow chancellor. He said: 'Is he demanding that your viewers keep every single receipt they get?...No, he wasn't.'

However, he added: 'As a matter of good housekeeping it's a good thing to do'

The Tories this morning claimed Mr Balls's suggestion revealed a 'complete lack of understanding' about business.

Work and Pensions Secretary Iain Duncan Smith said it was 'absurd'.

He said: 'I don't think anybody in the country probably does that unless they sit down and they do it as part of a process; in other words, if you are employing somebody in which the objective is paying them cash as a process of your business, then of course I suspect most businesses do keep some kind of record, that's the right thing to do.

'But if you have a one-off payment for something and you pay cash, I shouldn't think anybody in the country does that necessarily ... what it exemplifies is Labour's complete lack of understanding about how business works and, actually, how people get by.'

Labour's shadow business secretary Chuka Umunna said it was 'a matter of good housekeeping' to get a receipt for cash-in-hand jobs, following Ed Balls's remarks

Shadow Chuka Umunna refused five times to say whether Labour would hand back any money received from a donor found to have used aggressive tax avoidance.

He was quizzed on the subject on the Today programme yesterday by Jim Naughtie.

Mr Naughtie: Can we take it as an absolute given that if you discover that anyone who's given money to the Labour Party has been involved in aggressive tax avoidance, you give the money back?

Mr Umunna: I think the Labour Party would think twice about accepting money from people who fit the description that you give.

Mr Naughtie: No, simple question: If you've taken it, from somebody who is discovered to have been involved in aggressive tax avoidance, will you give the money back?

Mr Umunna: Well I'm not aware that we have taken money from anybody who's engaged.

Mr Naughtie: No, but if it emerged, nor am I, but if it emerged, are you going to be as good as your word? If it emerged, would you give that money back?

Mr Umunna: Well as I said, I think the Labour Party found out that somebody was engaged in aggressive tax avoidance, would think twice before taking the money.

Mr Naughtie: But if you had taken the money you'd give it back?

Mr Umunna: Well I'm not, I mean, you're asking me a hypothetical question, because I'm not aware that we have taken it.

Mr Naughtie: Well most questions in the run up to an election are hypothetical. You're talking about hypothetical questions about what you would do with business if you became a government. You aren't a government. Therefore that's hypothetical, this is hypothetical. Answer the question. If the money came from a tax dodger, would you give it back?

Mr Umunna: Well I'm not aware that it has, that we have received any monies from people engaging in aggressive tax avoidance.

He told BBC Breakfast: 'Here we have a man that would be the chancellor who is wandering around saying Big Brother is going to watch you carefully, that if you do any cash transactions and don't keep receipts, somehow they are going to punish you. I find that absurd.'

The shadow chancellor's comments came as Labour and the Tories engaged in furious clashes over tax dodging, with both sides complaining of smears.

As he was pressed on BBC Radio 5 Live's Pienaar's Politics about what constituted tax avoidance, Mr Balls said: 'The right thing to do if you are having somebody cut your hedge for a tenner is to make sure they give you their name and address and a receipt and a record for the fact that you have paid them.'

Asked whether he himself followed that rule, he said: 'Absolutely. That's because I am the shadow chancellor and I'm extremely careful about these things.

'Over my life, have I ever given people a tenner and not given a receipt for it? Probably yes.

But he had not done so 'since I have been involved in politics and Treasury matters'.

Mr Balls said: 'It's not your job to pay their taxes for them and I think most people you give a tenner to are not going to be VAT-registered.

'They've got the legal obligation to make sure they pay their taxes if it's that kind of transaction - but I think the sensible thing for anybody is that you've got a record of it and you've done it properly.'

Mr Duncan Smith said he could 'understand the frustrations people feel' about tax avoidance but insisted the Government had acted to close loopholes.

Mr Umunna this morning dismissed the row as 'a storm in a teacup'. He told Sky News: 'I sometimes think the whole way we do politics and debate things in this bubble is just so ridiculous.

'He was doomed if he did and doomed if he didn't, in answering that question. It's all over the papers this morning, and actually it's a bit of a storm in a teacup, in my view.'

Mr Umunna acknowledged that he did not keep all his own receipts, suggesting that Mr Balls was in a special position as he was putting himself forward as a future chancellor who might one day be in charge of HM Revenue and Customs.

'For my own part, do I keep a receipt every time I pay for something? I just paid for something using contactless payment, I didn't get a receipt for that,' Mr Umunna told Sky News.
