The Olympic torch carried by David Beckham when it arrived in Britain had attracted bids of more than £5,200 last night after going up for auction.

The aluminium flame-bearer, which is accompanied by a 'metallic shard' signed by the football star, is among a number of Games memorabilia up for sale online.

It is being sold through a website approved by the London Olympic Organising Committee (LOCOG), which describes it as 'a piece of history from the unforgettable journey of the Olympic Flame'.

The site is expected to sell off collectors' items include a baton from the men's 4 x 100 metres relay and tennis balls from the Olympic tournament once the Games get under way on July 27.

Mindful of criticisms that the Games have become too commercial, Locog said the funds raised would help to offset the cost of the  torch relay and of staging the Games themselves.

They denied that the website was set up in response to some participants selling their torches on the eBay auction website.

The website (www.london2012.com/auction), which is being overseen by Innovative Sports, features 20 torches, which organisers said cost £500 to manufacture.

Torchbearers involved in the relay around the British isles have been offered them for a subsidised price of £199 as a memento.

Bbut the ones up for sale on the website are those not wanted by the participants or donated by celebrities like Beckham.

The LA Galaxy and former Manchester United midfielder carried the torch when it first arrived in Britain on May 18.
