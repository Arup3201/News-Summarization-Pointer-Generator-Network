A man diving just off the coast of Florida is lucky to be alive after surviving a scary encounter with one of the ocean’s most dangerous predators – a great white shark.

Jimmy Roseman of West Melbourne, Flordia, was diving at 90 feet deep off the Atlantic Coast near Vero Beach with just a spear gun for protection when the great white noticed him.

Roseman had a GoPro camera attached to his helmet and so was able to capture every tense moment of his terrifying ordeal.

First Roseman sees the shark at a distance, but over the course of two minutes it keeps returning, getting closer and closer until he is forced to use his spear gun to prod the animal and scare it away.

‘In the video, it did look like it was kind of far away,’ he told FOX 35. ‘But the whole time it was about six to seven foot away from me.’

The ordeal lasts for just over two minutes and at one point, the fin of the 12-foot-long shark smacks into Roseman's air tank. 

Roseman doesn't shot or injure the shark and is eventually left unharmed.

The great white shark is typically found in cold and warm-temperate waters throughout the world, although occurrences in tropical waters have been documented, according to the National Oceanic and Atmospheric Administration.

In the western North Atlantic Ocean, the species is most commonly encountered in continental shelf. 

Research suggests that great whites migrate to Florida in a seasonal pattern with distribution limited by water temperature, food resources, or other factors.
