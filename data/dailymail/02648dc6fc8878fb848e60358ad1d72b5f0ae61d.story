As the new mayor of his local town, Terry Buckle was no doubt keen to make an instant impression.

And as these pictures show, the 73-year-old has certainly made a big impact - just not the kind he perhaps wanted.

Councillor Buckle smashed straight through the front door of his local Tesco store - just five days after becoming the new mayor of Bury St Edmunds in Suffolk.

Accident: Councillor Buckle smashed straight through the front door of his local Tesco store - just five days after becoming the new mayor of Bury St Edmunds in Suffolk

Embarrassing: As the new mayor of his local town, Terry Buckle was no doubt keen to make an instant impression. But this is perhaps not the impact which he was looking to make

The veteran councillor is thought to have hit his accelerator rather than his brake as he drove into a disabled bay in the store’s car park.

Councillor Buckle, who lives nearby, was taken to West Suffolk Hospital in Bury St Edmunds for a check-up before being released unhurt.

Mr Buckle's wife Pam, who was not with him at the time of the accident, said:  'I had a phone call from the police, who were the first ones at the accident.

'I went there and went with him to hospital in the ambulance.'

She added: 'He's home now. He's fine and he had an X-ray on his neck and he's just a bit sore.

'He's gone to bed with some tablets.'

The freak crash happened just after 4.30pm yesterday.

Mr Buckle's silver Vauxhall Vectra ploughed clean through the front door.

He managed to miss a brick wall on the left-hand side and a plate-glass window on the right.

Amazingly both the shop and his car escaped almost totally intact from the accident.

Dramatic: No shoppers were hurt but the mayor was quickly secured in a neck brace before being rushed to hospital

Bizarre: The car completely blocked the entrance to the store

Shocked eye-witnesses said it looked as if Cllr Buckle had pressed the accelerator instead of the brake as he pulled into a disabled bay.

One woman, who asked not to be named, said she had come down after a neighbour told her about the dramatic incident.

She said: 'It's just so lucky no one was seriously hurt because the car has gone right inside.'I think they've probably hit the wrong pedal.'

Another bystander said it was the second time a car had ended up inside the store. He said: 'Someone has done it before, but that time it was in the middle of the night so there wasn't any risk to anyone.'

Crowds turned out to watch police and recovery services inch the silver Vauxhall out - many posting footage to Facebook and Twitter.

Store staff also took pictures but refused to comment on the bizarre crash.

Mr Buckle's fellow Moreton Hall ward member, Frank Warby, said he had spoken to the mayor's daughter and been told he had only gone to hospital 'as a precaution'.

Cllr Warby said: 'He was taken to hospital just for a check over.

'Luckily enough he went through the doors and not the wall and only damaged the windows.'

Mr Buckle was made the 39th mayor of St Edmundsbury in a glittering ceremony of high pomp last Thursday.

Speaking at his mayor-making, he said: 'I am very much looking forward to my year in office.

'One of the joys of being mayor is the opportunity to support the work of charities.'

A Suffolk Police spokeswoman said: 'An elderly man was driving, there are no reports of any serious injuries.

'It appears he has driven into the door - there doesn't seem to be any reports of serious damage'.

A Suffolk Police spokeswoman confirmed that Mr Buckle would not be prosecuted over the crash.

She said: 'Officers have spoken to him and words of advice have been given. No further action is being taken.'
