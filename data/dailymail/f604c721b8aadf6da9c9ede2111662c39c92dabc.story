An inquisitive toddler had to be rescued by firefighters after getting her head stuck in a toilet training seat.

Emily Pitt got her head wedged in her older brother's training seat after trying it on as a hat.

Her mother, Sarah Pitt, at first laughed when her young daughter wandered into the living room with the seat around her neck - but then had to ring 999 when she was unable to get it off.

Ms Pitt, 35, said: 'I thought they would just give me advice on how to get it off - we spent 45 minutes trying to get it off and she was wedged in tight.

'We had to show her Peppa Pig on my iPhone to keep her quiet. The fire brigade showed up and carefully cut her free - I'm so grateful to them.

'Emily now keeps talking about how the firemen came and rescued her.'

Emily wandered into the bathroom of their home in Tadworth, Surrey, on Saturday afternoon where she found her older brother Owen's training seat.

She then toddled into the lounge with the seat around her neck, prompting her parents to contact the emergency services when they were unable to get it off.

Mother-of-four Ms Pitt said: 'She wasn't in pain or anything - the seat wasn't tight around her neck or anything like that.

'Obviously, we wanted to get it off without hurting her. Firemen spent about five minutes cutting it off with a hacksaw blade.

'I would like to warn other parents that if their child gets in the same situation, ring 999 rather than attempting to cut it off yourself.

'Parents aren't trained to do things like this - but luckily firemen are.'

She added: 'Emily's not the smallest two-year-old. She's quite big. It was a first for us and the fire station.

'It just goes to show I suppose that toilet training seats definitely shouldn't be used as a hat.'

Emily's father Adam added: 'All my little girl keeps talking about is how the firemen helped her.'
