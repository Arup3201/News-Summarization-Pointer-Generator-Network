An SAS sniper convicted of illegally stashing a pistol and 338 bullets in his bedroom was spared jail yesterday but left court with his reputation in tatters.

A judge reluctantly gave Sergeant Danny Nightingale, 38, a suspended two-year prison sentence but accused him of lying during his trial.

Sgt Nightingale had claimed that a brain injury meant he made a ‘false confession’ to police that he brought the Glock 9mm firearm home from Iraq as a war trophy. And he blamed a comrade, known only as Soldier N, for planting the weapon and ammunition in his bedroom.

Relief: Nightingale, pictured at the hearing today, has been spared a second prison sentence

But in a withering rebuke, Judge 
Advocate General Jeff Blackett said the war hero’s account ‘lacked 
credibility’. He said it was ‘inconceivable’ that Sgt Nightingale was 
unaware the pistol and live rounds were stored in a wardrobe and under 
his bed.

Judge Blackett said the soldier had ‘made up a spurious defence’ and ‘impugned the character’ of a colleague.

Sgt Nightingale, who had served on the
frontline in Iraq and Afghanistan during an 18-year career, ‘endangered
society’ by keeping the firearm in an unsecured rented home near SAS 
headquarters in Hereford.

Citing the gun massacres in Hungerford
in 1987 and Dunblane in 1996, he said: ‘This could have been a tempting
target for burglars and if there had been a burglary and the weapon and
ammunition had been taken, the consequences could have been 
terrifying.’

Ordeal: Nightingale has spent £120,000 on his unsuccessful attempt to clear his name and may launch an appeal

Judge Blackett also attacked the 
vigorous campaign, led by Sgt Nightingale’s wife Sally and backed by 
MPs, after the soldier was jailed for 18 months over the charges last 
November.

His conviction was later quashed and a
retrial took place before a military court earlier this month. The 
sniper denied the charges but was found guilty and appeared for 
sentencing yesterday, when he was given two years’ military detention 
suspended for 12 months.

The judge said the campaign to clear 
his name had been ‘misleading and uninformed’ and criticism of the 
prosecution ‘totally without foundation’.

He added: ‘We understand how difficult
these proceedings have been for you and your family. However, you have 
brought much of that anguish upon yourself and your public assertions 
that you are a scapegoat or the victim of some wider political agenda is
nonsense.’

Passing sentence, Judge Blackett 
criticised politicians who made ‘unfounded and uninformed remarks under 
the cloak of Parliamentary privilege. [I hope they] now realise how 
inappropriate and wrong their criticisms were.’

He told Sgt Nightingale that the crime
was so serious it deserved an ‘immediate custodial sentence’. But he 
took into account the soldier’s ‘exceptional’ record in the Army and 
said he was ‘constrained’ by previous court rulings.

Police found the weapon at the home 
Sgt Nightingale shared with Soldier N after a tip-off. The sniper told 
detectives he was given the Glock by Iraqi troops he trained and that 
the ammunition was left over from his job as a range instructor.

But at his trial Sgt Nightingale 
insisted he had made a ‘false confession’ that he blamed on memory loss 
caused by a brain injury suffered when he collapsed during a charity run
in the Brazilian jungle in 2009.

He claimed that Soldier N, jailed 
after admitting possessing another Glock, brought both pistols back from
Iraq and planted one in his bedroom to avoid a tougher sentence.

Yesterday, Sgt Nightingale’s wife 
Sally expressed anger at the comments of Judge Blackett. ‘I feel quite 
upset that it’s been suggested that we misled people because that’s one 
thing we have not done,’ she said outside the Military Court in Bulford,
Wiltshire. ‘We’ve been very honest and open.

‘Danny is angry about the words used in court against his family and the people who have supported him.’

Sgt Nightingale’s father, Humphrey, said the judge’s remarks were ‘a kick in the teeth’.

The soldier has received a medical discharge that will start on February 14 next year. Until then he remains in the Army.
