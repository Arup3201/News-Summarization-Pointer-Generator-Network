Prince Harry has appointed a former Army officer and PR man as his first private secretary.

Edward Lane Fox, 36, will join the prince in June shortly after Harry returns from a tour of the United States.

Mr Lane Fox was a captain in the Blues and Royals, a regiment of the Household Cavalry, and served in Bosnia and Iraq before joining financial communications firm RLM Finsbury, reports the Daily Telegraph.

He met the prince, who began his military career in the same regiment, during his Army years.

Harry was involved in the interview process for the role, which comes after he joined his brother and sister-in-law in setting up the Household Office of the Duke and Duchess of Cambridge and Prince Harry at Kensington Palace last year.

Their break away from Prince Charles's office at St James's Palace was seen as a sign that Harry, William and Kate will be increasing their public duties.

A St James's Palace spokesman told the newspaper that Mr Lane Fox and Prince Harry had both been involved with the Burnaby Blue Foundation, which has worked with Harry's charity Sentebale in Lesotho.
