She may be the heir to a multi-million pound empire but Topshop heiress Chloe Green is carving out a successful career for herself, one fashionable step at a time.

The
 24-year-old daughter of Arcadia boss Sir Philip Green has spent the past few months travelling the globe to gather inspiration for her SS14 footwear range, which lands in shops today.

Speaking to FEMAIL about the new Chloe Jade Green collection, the designer said: 'I have been travelling a lot to get inspiration for my range. I've spent time in the States and South America to get an idea of the markets out there.'

First look: Chloe Green has unveiled a new footwear and accessories range, which will be landing in Topshop, Miss Selfridge and on her website today

The result? A 12-strong trend-led collection of monochrome wedges, studded stilettos and butterfly applique embellished sandals designed to take her wearers from desk to dancefloor this summer.

'I am following the trend for lower heels this season but I didn't take much inspiration from the catwalks because I always want to base my designs on what I'd wear myself. I don't want to lose what's me,' she explained.

Speaking about her personal style, she said: 'I would say I'm edgy chic but effortlessly put together. I love Givenchy and YSL and high street wise, I usually shop in Topshop and I love Zara at the moment.'

New range: Chloe, who isn't modelling the range herself this season, has created a 12-strong trend-led collection of heels and sandals

Staying true to her style: Chloe, who describes her look as 'edgy chic', hopes her new footwear reflects her personal style

In keeping with her signature style, each shoe has a green sole and is named by Chloe herself.

The former Made In Chelsea star has named each shoe after places she visited across the Americas - and from Upper East to Rio de Janeiro, the city styles are reflected in each design.

She has aimed to create fashionable and flattering designs, explaining: 'I have designed the shoes so they don't cut above your ankle - they make your legs look longer.'

Her
roster of celebrity fans now includes the likes of A-listers Kim Kardashian, Demi Lovato and 
Nicole Ritchie and she is hoping her latest green-soled shoe collection proves just as popular.

Low point: Chloe's new range incorporates the trend for lower heels, which she says Kate Moss will love

'I have sent some to Emma Roberts and Rita Ora, Cara Delevingne and Naomi Campbell will be coming to my launch event so I am really excited to introduce them to the range and see which designs they choose.

'Rita's style is so cool, I love it. I think that by wearing them, she will inspire people to wear them in a different way.'

Chloe also has a pair with Kate Moss' name on - the good friends recently holidayed together and Kate is set to unveil a clothing collection in Topshop this season.

'Kate loves lower heels, so I think she will covet the Pasadina shoe I have created,' said Chloe.

Chloe, who couldn't live without her bronzer and describes her beauty look as 'natural', has plans to take her range forward.

'I am taking the future as it comes. I am looking forward to doing some more travelling and heading to the Grand Prix but I am so pleased with how the collection has turned out and I'm already working on my winter range.

'Who knows, perhaps some going out dresses to complement my shoes could be my next step,' she said.

Prices start from Â£75 and land today on CJG.com, Selfridges.com and Topshop.com
