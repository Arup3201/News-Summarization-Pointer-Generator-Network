Dani Alves is far from introverted at the best of times, and the Barcelona defender has further confirmed his status as a wacky character with the release of a music video alongside Jose Pinto.

All in aid of charity, the Brazilian defender has teamed up with his former Barcelona colleague to release a single titled 'You're Special', in which he features rapping and singing in the music video.

Pinto was a goalkeeper at the Nou Camp until his retirement in 2014, and has now continued with his career as a producer and musician under the guise 'Wahin'.

All proceeds from the single, titled 'You're Special', go to a bulimia and anorexia charity called FEACAB

He and Alves, alongside singer Mario Baro, have collaborated in aid of FEACAB, a charity aiming to combat eating disorders like anorexia and bulimia.

The song, 'You're Special', is focused on 'inspiring contagious optimism' and should 'motivate people... to break down those barriers and feel good with themselves'.

Previously, Pinto/Wahin has released two songs, entitled 'Feel That You Are Alive' and 'Live Singing', but 'You're Special' is the first track dedicated solely to charity.

Here, for your aural pleasure is the video... and it'll be in your head all day.

The full proceeds will go to FEACAB, and the song is available to purchase on Amazon, Google Play, iTunes, and the official website: www.veaportussuenos.com
