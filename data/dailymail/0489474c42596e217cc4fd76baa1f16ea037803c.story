This is the moment a bin cleaner came within moments of winning £5.5million at York races – only to see his horse miss out on the crucial first place.

But Craig Brazier, 39, still managed a smile, having pocketed £1.3million in an earlier gamble. The father-of-two had backed six winners in a ‘Scoop6’ bet the previous weekend, giving him a free selection for the race on Saturday and the chance to win a further £5.5million.

As his choice, Tumblewind, approached the last furlong it seemed Mr Brazier might win. But his hopes were dashed in the last seconds as the horse dropped all the way back to 11th place.

Bin cleaner Craig Brazier watches on as his £5.5 million horse hits the front just a furlong from home

The 39-year-old is just seconds away from scooping the monster jackpot as his horse Tumblewind approaches the winning post in York

The anticipation of the £5.5 million prize was cruelly torn away when the horse slowed up during the final ten seconds of the race, blowing its lead

Despite the result, Mr Brazier said: ‘I’ve enjoyed every minute … I’d backed the winner too many times on the all-weather without winning, so I’d never have picked it.’

Mr Brazier and seven others including 43-year-old Bernard Marantelli had backed six winners the previous Saturday on the Scoop6 to get a free selection on the Knavesmire and a chance to win a further £5.5 million.

After winning £1.3 million the previous week he was given the chance to join Mr Marantelli and two other gamblers in a syndicate yesterday but he turned them down and decided to go it alone.

Mr Brazier, who plans to go back to work bin cleaning, shook the Mr Marantelli’s hand over a glass of champagne in a box overlooking the finish line after the race.

He said: ‘Good luck to them.

‘I have enjoyed every minute. It’s been absolutely brilliant and for a few seconds it looked like my pick Tumblewind had a great chance.

‘But I’d backed the winner too many times on the all weather without winning, so I’d never have picked it. They did well and we’re all happy.’
