More than 25,000 British military personnel have been found to be obese since 2010, shocking new figures have revealed. 

Despite the Ministry of Defence insisting its employees 'must be healthy', more than 16,400 soldiers' body mass index was considered them obese between January 2010 and September 2014. 

Some 5,000 members of the RAF fell into the obese category while 3,000 sailors were also considered drastically overweight. 

More than 25,000 military personnel have been found to be obese according to Government figures 

The figures, revealed by the Sunday Times via a Freedom of Information request, seek to undermine the widespread view that all military personnel must be fit and healthy. 

'I just find it staggering that the army or any public service should allow its service to become what I regard as less able to respond in an emergency,' Tam Fry, of the National Obesity Forum told the newspaper. 

'These people have got plenty of time to keep in shape and I think it is a responsibility to feed them properly and give them any amount of time to do exercises and keep themselves in shape.'

A spokesman for the Armed Forces however said it was 'misleading' to consider BMI a marker for obesity, as the weight-to-height ratio does not differentiate between muscle mass and body fat on the scales.

'We work hard to ensure our Armed Forces personnel are healthy and fit. 

'It is a condition of service that all personnel must be healthy and undergo regular fitness tests,' they added. 

Earlier figures revealed 50 people had been discharged from the Armed Forces because they were considered too fat to serve. 

In 2011 alone, 13 soldiers were asked to leave over obesity.
