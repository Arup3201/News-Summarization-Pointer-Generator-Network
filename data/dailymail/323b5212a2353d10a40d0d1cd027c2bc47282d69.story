Northern Ireland Peter Robinson threatened to resign if the UK government refuses to order a judicial inquiry into the blunders

Northern Ireland's First Minister dramatically threatened to quit today din protest at the collapse of the Hyde Park bomb trial.

Peter Robinson said he had been left in the dark about a catalogue of appalling blunders by police and prosecutors which saw one of the alleged bombers John Downey walk free from court.

He condemned the 'despicable' way the UK government had behaved and demanded an urgent judicial inquiry into how letters were sent to scores of suspects telling them they were not wanted by police.

Downey, 62, was arrested last year and was due to stand trial for the July 1982 nail bomb atrocity which killed four Household Cavalry soldiers and seven horses and injured 31 people.

Another horse, Sefton, survived and became a national hero.

But convicted IRA terrorist Downey was told yesterday that he would not face prosecution because of a letter – dubbed a ‘get-out-of-jail-free card’ – mistakenly sent to him saying he was not wanted by police.

The letter was sent in July 2007, when Tony Blair was Prime Minister, assuring him he was not wanted for any offence despite a warrant for his arrest existing since May 29, 1983.

The case has created a major stand-off between Belfast and London, with the Westminster government refusing to take the matter any further.

Issuing his threat to resign, Mr Robinson said: ‘I am not prepared to be the First Minister of a government that has found itself having salient facts relevant to matters that are devolved hidden from them.

‘That is not acceptable to me. I want to have a full judicial inquiry into who knew what, when they knew it and exactly what they did know at the time.

‘I also want to ensure that the letters that have been sent out are rescinded.

'The despicable way that the government has treated the institutions in Northern Ireland shows that they don't uphold the institutions in Northern Ireland.'

In the House of Commons, David Cameron condemned the 'dreadful mistake' of the letter being sent to Mr Downey.

But signalled that the decision to release Downey would not be overturned. The Prime Minister told MPs: 'We should be absolutely clear - the man should never have received the letter that he received, Downey.

'It was a dreadful mistake and a mistake that we now need to have a rapid factual review to make sure that this cannot happen again.

'But, whatever happens, we have to stick to the principle that we are a country and a government under the rule of law.'

Defence Minister Anna Soubry, a former barrister, said she could understand why Mr Robinson was 'very angry' but there was no chance of a judicial review.

She told BBC Radio 4's World At One: 'He can't get a judicial review, with the best will in the world.

'You can't judicially review the decision. You can appeal it, the prosecution can appeal it. Dominic Grieve has made it clear the CPS has taken the view that these are not the right circumstances to appeal it.

'So, with great respect to Peter Robinson, who is quite right to be very angry, absolutely right to be angry, but we are in a very, very unpleasant, bad situation and, unfortunately, I cannot see any way back from where we are now.'

Later Attorney General Dominic Grieve repeatedly rejected emotional pleas to reopen the case.

He told MPs: ‘John Anthony Downey was arrested on 19 May 2013 at Gatwick Airport where he was en route to Greece.

‘On his arrest he produced a letter stating that he was free to enter the jurisdiction without fear of arrest. Despite that letter he was charged by the Crown Prosecution Service (CPS) with four counts of murder.

‘Before he was charged my consent was sought, as the law requires, for him to face a charge of causing an explosion. I gave that consent.

‘I believed then that it was right to do so and I remain of the same view today.’

He insisted the scheme under which the letter was issued did not amount to an amnesty, adding: ‘Can I firstly make the point that it's clear from the judgment and the supporting material that the administrative scheme was not and never could be an amnesty?’

However MPs lined up to condemn what is seen as a ‘monumental’ blunder.

Household Cavalry soldiers Anthony 'Denis' Daly (left) and Roy Bright 
(right) said they 'never ceased in their desire to see that justice be 
done'

Laurence Robertson, Conservative chairman of the Northern Ireland select committee, said called for the name of person who authorised the scheme to be made public and suggested it may have come from Mr Blair himself.

He said: ‘Surely that must have been the prime minister of the time?’

Mr Robertson also questioned the role of the Police Service of Northern Ireland (PSNI), which gave assurances to Mr Downey that he was not being pursued by any police force in the United Kingdom.

Nearly 200 suspected IRA terrorists on the run have received  similar letters, effectively granting them an amnesty under a deal by Mr Blair and Sinn Fein leader Gerry Adams.

Families of the victims of the Hyde Park bombing said they felt ‘devastatingly let down’ by ‘catastrophic failures’ and called for a review of the ‘comfort letters’ issued to IRA suspects.

In a statement, the relatives of Corporal Roy Bright, 36, Lieutenant Anthony Daly, 23, Trooper Simon Tipper and Lance Corporal Jeffrey Young, both 19, who were slain when a bomb packed with 30lbs of nails exploded as the Blues and Royals rode to the Changing of the Guard ceremony, said: ‘It is with great sadness and bitter  disappointment that we have received the full and detailed  judgment and that a trial will now not take place.

‘This news has left us all feeling devastatingly let down, even more so when the monumental blunder behind this judgment lies at the feet of the Police Service of Northern Ireland.

‘The end result is that the opportunity for the full chain of those terrible events will never be put in the public domain for justice to be seen to be done.’

Judith Jenkins, 52, the widow of L/Cpl Young, added: ‘It’s the cruellest injustice. For 32 years we have waited for justice.

‘We all had our hopes raised and this has been a total shock. It’s absolutely staggering how many blunders have happened in this case. This case has made a mockery of the criminal justice system.’

Lieutenant Denis DalyThe
 23-year-old had been married for just 27 days when he died at the 
scene. The blast tragically happened as his mother was waiting in nearby
 Horse Guards for the mounted troop to arrive. Lt Daly had not long 
returned from a tour in Northern Ireland where his replacement was shot 
and killed by a sniper

Squadron Quartermaster Corporal Roy BrightThe
 36-year-old was the standard bearer of the Blues and Royals, and died 
in hospital three days after being injured in the blast

Trooper Simon TipperThe 19-year-old had also been married for less than a month, and died at the scene

Lance Corporal Jeffrey YoungThe
 19-year-old was married with two children, aged three and 22 months. He
 died the day after the blast - a week before his 20th birthday

For
 more than 30 years, John Downey has had the IRA bombing in Hyde Park 
hanging over his head - and the families of four victims denied justice.
