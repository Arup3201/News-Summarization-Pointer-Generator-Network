He overcame a very public battle with alcohol addiction a decade ago.

Now Midge Ure warns the fact that drink is available ‘everywhere’ makes it frighteningly easy for people to turn into addicts.

Midge Ure, seen here with his Visage bandmate Steve Strange in 1982, said it is not until you try and give up alcohol that you realise it is 'in every corner shop, it is in garages, it is on the motorways, it is everywhere'

The former Ultravox singer condemned the widespread availability of alcohol in ‘corner shops, garages and on motorways’.

The 60-year-old said: ‘It is fairly well documented I got myself into trouble with a bit of alcohol. And it’s quite easy to do, I have to say, because it is deemed socially acceptable – and it is everywhere.

Mr Ure has now been sober for nine years and credits his family with helping him overcome his addiction

‘It is not
 until you try and give up you realise it is in every corner shop, it is
 in garages, it is on the motorways, it is everywhere.’

The 
Scottish musician’s heavy drinking spiralled into addiction after his 
father’s death in 2001 and he claims that dealing with trauma can push 
anyone over the edge.

‘It
 is the very, very, very fine line between being able to deal with that 
stuff and just falling over, and I kind of fell over for a little bit,’ 
he told BBC Radio Manchester.

‘And I was just quite shocked at how easy it was – to turn, for that to happen to anybody. And that’s not just me, you know, we’re all under huge amounts of pressure financially, socially, emotionally, all of that, so I think we’re all potentially very fragile.’

The father of four said that his family helped him to overcome his addiction and he has been sober now for nine years.

As
 well as having hits with Ultravox, Ure also enjoyed success in the 
1980s alongside Steve Strange in the band Visage and went on to produce 
and co-write Band Aid’s Do They Know It’s Christmas? with Bob Geldof. 
This month he released a new album called Fragile, partly inspired by 
his addiction experience.

The
 star, who has four daughters, one by first wife Annabel Giles and three
 by his second, Sheridan Forbes, revealed previously that he will always
 be tempted to drink but the thought of his family’s pain stops him.

Tom, from Beaconsfield, was the first person to have a drink at Wetherspoons motorway pub

He
 said: ‘The horrible thing about addiction is you think it is only 
harming you, but it is not. Am I ever tempted to drink again? You always
 are, it is the monkey on your shoulder. But what stops me doing it is 
my family.’

In
 January, Britain’s first motorway service station pub opened at 
Beaconsfield services on the M40. The Wetherspoons branch served its 
first customer a pint at 9.21am.

Research
 shows people consume more alcohol when it is easily available. A 
Swedish study found consumption rose by 15 per cent when it was on sale 
in grocery stores and dropped by the same amount when banned from the 
shops.
