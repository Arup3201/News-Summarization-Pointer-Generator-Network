A central Indiana girls high school basketball game turned into a rout Tuesday night when Bloomington South High School beat Arlington High School by a final score of 107-2.

The shocking score line has sparked outrage, not for the embarrassed losers but for the winners who have been accused of unsportsman-like behavior after running up the massive score.

‘(The score) is probably not what we would like to see,’ said Chris Kaufman, spokesman for the Indiana High School Athletic Association, which doesn’t have a so-called mercy rule. 

Basketball massacre: Bloomington South beat Arlington 107-2 in girls basketball, but some people think they went too far

Also known by the slightly less polite term slaughter rule, the mercy rule brings a sports event to an early end when one team has a commanding lead over the other.

It is called the mercy rule because it spares the losing team the humiliation of suffering a massacre. While extremely rare in competitive sports, it is common at a high school level.

Defending his team’s victory, Bloomington coach Larry Winters told RTV6 that he played all nine girls on the team during the game.

Lauren Whitlach tallied 30 points for the winning team and the result is their first ever victory by more than 34 points.

Arlington's only two points came from free throws in the second and third quarters.

The high scoring game has ignited much debate online.

‘Say what you want, but a 107-2 score makes Bloomington South look worse than it does Arlington,’ tweeted Jake Query, a host for 1260 WNDE.

Debate over the mercy rule rages on the RTV6 Facebook page, where most commenters were upset by the scoreline

Arlington High School's girls basketball team has played six and lost six this season

The debate also raged on the RTV6 Facebook page, where most commentators were upset by the scoreline.

'I'm from Bloomington and think that's just wrong. They should have pulled the players!' wrote Amy Clark Woolf.

'Coaches should of pulled players or they should of called the game,' Jamie Trusty Haddan wrote.

'Nothing like disgracing the other team. Coaches should of thought of how the other teams players felt and what it would of felt like if that was their team.'

'If you don't want the other team to score so high, stop them,' wrote Jay Carter.

But others defended the game.

'Nothing wrong with that at all,' Matt Lucas wrote.

'I think it's a game and should be played however they want to as long as no rules are broke,' Danielle Gwaltney wrote. 'Is Bloomingtons team that good...or is Indys that bad?!'

Bloomington South moved to 7-1 following the victory, while Arlington fell to 0-6 after finishing last season with a 1-19 record.
