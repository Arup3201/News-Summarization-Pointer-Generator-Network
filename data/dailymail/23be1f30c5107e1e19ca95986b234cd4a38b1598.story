Gerard Pique has quashed rumours linking him with a return to Manchester United by stating his ambition to finish his career at Barcelona.

The 27-year-old has been largely overlooked by new boss Luis Enrique this season, managing to only start three of the Catalan giants seven La Liga games to date.

Summer signing Jeremy Mathieu and Javier Mascherano have been Enrique's preferred central defensive partnership so far but Pique is determined to fight for his place at the Nou Camp.

The Spain international has been linked with a move to his former club United, who have their well-documented defensive issues, but the centre-back told FourFourTwo of his desire to follow club icon Carles Puyol in retiring at Barcelona.

'I love this club for its history, its style of play and its connection to Catalunya,' Pique said.

'I love it here. I am at the best club in the world right now. I have no intention of leaving now or later. I've just signed a new contract and I want to retire a Blaugrana, just like [Carles] Puyol did.

'You never know what the future holds, but right now, I love this city, I love the people in the club, and most importantly, I love the institution. I don't see myself leaving.'
