Luis Enrique has laid down the law to his Barcelona players ahead of the new season.

The strict coach has implemented a fines list which will see players punished for things from turning up late to training to arriving home after midnight.

Many rules similar to these were in place during Pep Guardiola's era at Barcelona but were slackened after he left.

Best behaviour: Barcelona manager Enrique has laid down strict disciplinary guidelines for his players

Players must arrive one hour before training begins

Players must not be late for meals with the club

Alcohol is completely prohibited during meals. 

Players have to be home by midnight in the two days before a game

Declarations from the players must always be respectful

Players must be responsible when using social media like Twitter, Facebook and Instagram

Players must wear official club clothes on club business

Players are prohibited from taking part in dangerous activities, like alpine sports, using motorbikes and diving

Severe acts of misconduct could result in players being expelled from the club

Tata 
Martino was renowned for being lax and Enrique hopes his disciplinary 
scheme will sharpen up a squad of stars who under-performed last 
season.

The players have already reacted well to the new coach's arrival, working hard in training to impress Enrique.

Now they can impress him in another way - not breaking any of the rules which he has imposed. 

As reported by Catalan newspaper Sport, players will be fined between €1,000 and €6,000 if they break Enrique's laws.

Fines
 at the top end of the scale are considered very serious breaches of 
discipline and will then be further punished by at club executive 
level. 

A severe act of misconduct could see a player expelled from the club.

It
 is not known if biting another player falls into this category, but 
with Luis Suarez suspended for four months for doing just that, it would
 be in his interest to find out.

Enrique
 has demanded that players arrive at the Ciutat Esportiva for training 
an hour earlier than activities are scheduled to begin.

A sign-in register has already been created at Barcelona's training complex.

While
 the penalty for lateness will be on the low end of the scale, missing a
 session without good reason will be heavily punished.

Alcohol is completely prohibited during meal-times, with players drinking water or carbonated beverages.

Guardiola
 occasionally used to permit drinks with a low alcoholic content to be 
consumed, but Enrique is taking a hard-line stance on this issue. 

Enrique has also told the players that they must be home before midnight the two days before a game.

Guardiola
 used to conduct checks by calling on a player he suspected was 
contravening his rules but it is not clear if Enrique will do the same.

Given the Asturian's low tolerance threshold for misbehaviour, it seems likely.

Players have also been informed that they must wear official gear on club trips or events.

This could see an end to the likes of Alex Song and Neymar wearing their own branded clothes before and after games.

The squad have also been told that when they speak, at events or press conferences, they must always be respectful.

In the doghouse: Gerard Pique was forced to apologise for leaking the sale of Cesc Fabregas to Chelsea

Enrique
 would not have been impressed with Gerard Pique, for example, when he 
gave away that Cesc Fabregas was leaving Barcelona.

The
 centre-back actually apologised for this on Thursday, admitting that 
discussing it in public with Spain manager Vicente del Bosque was a 
mistake.

This applies to social media too - they have been reminded of their responsibilities.

Enrique
 is happy for the players to use Twitter, Facebook and Instagram, but if
 he decides during the season that they are giving the club a negative 
image he could clamp down upon it.

They are not permitted to undertake dangerous sports or activities, like riding motorbikes, mountain climbing and even diving.

Enrique has decreed that fines accrued during the season will be given to charity.

Sport
 claim the first fine has already been paid, with Pique receiving the 
dubious debut honour, while Barcelona train at St George's Park.

It was the lightest possible sanction, for being late by a few minutes.

The
 defender was regularly in hot water under Guardiola's disciplinary 
scheme and it seems like not much has changed in that regard.

One area which has not been revealed yet is Enrique's demands over the players diets.

While
 Guardiola kept Lionel Messi away from red meat, Martino allowed the 
Argentine to enjoy it, with some claiming that it detracted from his 
performances.
