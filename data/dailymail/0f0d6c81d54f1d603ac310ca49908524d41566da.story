These days they are the hosts of one of Britain’s best loved and most popular shows – Strictly Come Dancing.

And as these childhood pictures clearly show, Tess Daly and Claudia Winkleman knew how to pose for the camera from a very young age.

Both of them angelic blondes when these photos were taken, they’ve now evolved very distinctive styles.

Stars in the making:  A young Tess Daly pictured on a family holiday (left) and Claudia Winkleman sitting in her garden

Miss Daly, 44, has kept the straight, fair locks she had when she posed for this family beach holiday snap.

She and her sister Karen, 42, were brought up in Derbyshire by parents Vivian and Sylvia. Now married to TV presenter Vernon Kay, 40, she has two daughters of her own.

Miss Winkleman, 42, who is the daughter of former newspaper editor Eve Pollard and publisher Barry Winkleman, has changed her appearance dramatically as she has grown up.

The curly blonde hair she had as a toddler in this garden picture have been replaced by straight, dark brown locks. But as the photo makes clear, she has sported her trademark fringe since childhood.

After she appeared without a fringe on last Friday’s first live Strictly episode, viewers called for her to revert to her customary look and she promised to bring it back in future shows.

In an interview with Tatler magazine, the mother-of-three said: ‘The fringe is here to stay. I will never wake up and think, “I’ll tell you what I need – some curls.” Or, “I think it might be time to buy a crimper.” Or, “What I’m craving is a new look”.’

Strictly double act: After the departure of long-serving co-presenter Bruce Forsyth, Claudia Winkleman became Tess Daly's partner in crime

Miss Daly replaced Sir Bruce Forsyth as the main Strictly host when the 86-year-old presenter stepped down after 11 series. Miss Winkleman, who used to co-present the results show, stepped up to become her co-host.

Miss Daly has played down the fuss made over their partnership, saying: ‘On the one hand, I’m really proud that we’re doing this, but on the other hand, I feel in this day and age why should everyone make such a big deal of two women in their 40s presenting a show?

‘It’s 2014. Women are out there doing everything.’

The duo will return for the second live Strictly Come Dancing show this evening at 6.20pm on BBC1.
