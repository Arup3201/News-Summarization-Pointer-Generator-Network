A 20-year-old cellist from Rhode Island won the Miss USA crown and will represent the United States in this year's Miss Universe pageant, after she made it clear that she embraced all beauty queens- transgender or otherwise- during the interview portion of the competition.

Olivia Culpo topped a field of 51 beauty queens on Sunday to take the title at the Planet Hollywood Resort & Casino on the Las Vegas Strip.

She strutted across the stage in a purple bikini and a purple evening gown with sparkly belt.

In the dreaded final question round, Ms Culpo was faced with the most difficult question of the night: would it be fair for a person born a man to be named Miss Universe after becoming a woman?

Ms Culpo never stumbled as she embraced the Miss Universe Organization's recent decision to admit transgender contestants.

‘I do think that would be fair,’ Ms Culpo said. ‘But I could understand how people could be apprehensive to take that road.’

Ms Culpo said she was short and chubby as a girl, but blossomed after a growth spurt.

Rather than spending all her time 
primping and focused on her looks, she attended band camp in the summer,
 devoting much of her time to her cello.

Miss
 Iowa USA Rebecca Hodge was named Miss Congeniality, and Miss Oregon USA
 Alaina Bergsma was named the most photogenic. They both won $1,000, but
 didn't make the top 16.

The pageant at the Planet Hollywood 
casino on the Las Vegas Strip had three competitions: swimsuit, evening 
gowns and interview question.

Ms Culpo will represent the United States at the 61st Miss Universe pageant later this year. An American has not been named Miss Universe since Brook Lee won the title in 1997.

The Miss Universe Organization is co-owned by NBC and Donald Trump and is not affiliated with the Miss America pageant.
