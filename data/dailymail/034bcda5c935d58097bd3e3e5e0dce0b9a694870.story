Two teenage girls from West Virginia who were handed lengthy prison sentences last year in the stabbing death of their best friend had repeatedly claimed they killed 16-year-old Skylar Neese simply because they didn't like her anymore.

But the contents of Skylar’s personal diary suggest that the straight-A student may have known a salacious secret about her two friends and was threatening to reveal it.

Rachel Shoaf, along with her friend Sheila Eddy, lured Neese out of her house in July 2012, before stabbing her multiple times and hiding her body in a Pennsylvania wood.

Did she know too much? It has been suggested that Skylar Neese, 16 (left), was killed in 2012 by her friends Sheila Eddy and Rachel Shoef (right) because they feared she would tell about their lesbian tryst

'Dark secret': Skylar allegedly wrote in her diary (pictured) that during a sleepover in her house she walked in on Sheila and Rachel having sex together

Taunt: In June 2012, Skylar sent out this tweet, possibly reminding her friends that she knew about their sexual relationship

Skylar may have sealed her fate with a couple of tweets alluding to a secret she had been keeping

It was not until six months later that the accomplices finally confessed to the savage murder and led officers to the remote location where Skylar's body had been concealed.

When interviewed by police, Rachel, a high school drama star, told investigators that she and Sheila stabbed Skylar to death because they no longer liked her as a friend.

But according to a new book 'Pretty Little Killers,' which details the horrific murder, the girls may have been scared that Skylar was planning to out them as a lesbian couple.

The lesbian affair theory has been detailed by the authors of the new book 'Pretty Little Killers'

This theory was repeated on Friday's episode of 20/20 on ABC dedicated to the shocking case.  

In her diary obtained by authors Daleen Berry and Geoffrey Fuller, Skylar Neese reportedly wrote in graphic detail about walking in on Sheila and Rachel having sex during a sleepover in her home.

And in the weeks after the incident, the 16-year-old University High student apparently made sure her friends were aware that she knew their secret.

'Just know I know,' Skylar tweeted on one occasion, while on another she wrote about her desire to tell 'everything' to everyone - if she thought she could get away with it.

However, neither Skylar’s parents nor police investigators have embraced the idea that Shoef and Eddy murdered Skylar in cold blood just to stop her from speaking out about their alleged sexual tryst.

Mary Neese, Skylar’s mother, told ABC’s 20/20 that her daughter had many gay and lesbian friends, and she would not have taunted  someone because of their sexual preference.

On their part, investigators involved in the case got the impression from their interactions with Shoef and Eddy that the teens stabbed Neese ‘for the thrill of it’ and to see if they could get away with murder.

When they finally confessed to the crime long after Skylar's disappearance, the two accomplices said they had planned the friend's murder in science class, discussing in detail which weapon to use and where to hide the body.

Before that fateful night on July 6, Shoef and Eddy bought cleaning supplies and tools for digging. The girls then stashed several knives in their hooded sweatshirts and drove to Skylar's home, according to police.  

Eddy and Shoaf 
lured Skylar out of her ground-floor bedroom in Star City and took her 
to a secluded spot across state lines to Pennsylvania.

Dismayed: Skylar's parents, Mary and Dave Neese, said in the days after their daughter's disappearance, Sheila came to their house looking distraught and asked to sit in her friend's room

All smiles: This photo was allegedly taken just a day after the murder showing Rachel (right) looking carefree at the beach with a friend

The
 trio spent some time smoking marijuana in the woods. When Skylar got up to grab a lighter, Shoef and Eddy trailed her with knives at the ready, and 
on count three they began stabbing her.

The 16-year-old tried to run away, by Rachel tackled her to the ground, and one of the teens then slashed her jugular vein.

All along, the
 plan was to bury Skylar's body, but the ground proved too hard. So, according to authorities, the girls covered their murdered former friend
 with branches and left her in a wooded area for months.

As Skylar's distraught parents, police and the entire community were frantically searching for the missing girl, Sheila kept up a disturbingly normal social media presence.

On July 7, 2012, just a day after she and Shoaf killed Miss Neese, Eddy tweeted a 'happy birthday' message to a friend.

Eddy kept up a steady stream of 
tweets about watching Law And Order on TV, doing homework and going to 
parties, according to the new episode of ABC's 20/20 that aired Friday.

She
 also tweeted about how close her friendship was with Shoaf, writing: 
'no one on this earth can handle me and rachel is you think you can 
you're wrong.'

But away 
from social media, Sheila played the role of a heartbroken friend, 
going to the Neeses' home to spend time with her parents.  

In retrospect, what stood out – and 
horrified - Skylar’s parents the most is the time when Eddy came over and asked 
to sit on the missing girl’s bed.

Eddy posted this message months after she and friend Rachel Shoaf murdered 16-year-old Skylar Neese

In the 20/20 interview, Mrs Neese 
described how her daughter’s killer wept in Skylar’s room. The mother even sat down next to her and comforted her, gently rubbing her back.

‘Oh my Lord, and we believed that garbage,’ Mrs Neese said.

Dave Neese added: ‘Skylar trusted those two little witches and it cost her life.’

When
 investigators questioned the Neeses about their daughter’s circle of 
friends, Dave Neese asked police to leave Sheila alone.

From one 
police interview to the next, Shoef and Eddy repeated the same version 
of events, insisting that they did not take Skylar on a ride away from 
Star City on the night the went missing.

The first clue came when police obtained surveillance 
video from the night of July 6 showing Sheila's car driving away from the town towards the Pennsylvania border, which directly contracted Shoef and 
Eddy’s perfectly rehearsed story.

Sheila Eddy volunteered to take a 
lie detector test, which police said she failed. When it was Rachel’s 
turn to face the polygraph, the high school drama star jumped out of her
 father’s moving car on the way to the test.

Duplicity: Mary and Dave Neese welcomed Sheila Eddy into their home after Skylar's disappearance and even comforted her as she sobbed in her 'friend's room

Meanwhile, the Neese 
family and the girls’ friends started putting pressure on the duo to 
come clean about the night of Skyler’s disappearance.

In January 2013, six months 
after Skyler vanished without a trace, 16-year-old Rachel had a nervous 
breakdown and had to be sent to a psychiatric hospital. Upon her 
release, she headed straight to police.

‘The first words out of her mouth were, ‘”We stabbed her,”’ an investigator working the missing person case recalled.

A few days later, Sheila Eddy was back on Twitter, posting messages about watching her favorite TV shows.

In March, authorities announced that the remains found belonged to Skylar Neese. Even then, Eddy was still keeping up the act.

She posted a picture montage of the girls together with the message: 'Rest easy Skylar, you’ll ALWAYS be my best friend.'

She then tweeted that it was the 'worst day of my whole life'.

For a time, Eddy refused to cooperate with the investigation. Police decided to
 put a wire on Rachel hoping to incriminate her accomplice, but Sheila 
said nothing during their encounter. 

Eddy tweeted this message shortly before her arrest for the murder of Skylar Neese. Fellow murderer Rachel Shoaf had already admitted to police that the girl's decided to count to three and then stab the 16-year-old

Days after Rachel Shoaf admitted to killing her friend Skylar Neese along with Eddy, the latter was back on Twitter posting messages about TV

A break in the case came when police officers found traces of blood in Sheila 
Eddy’s car. A DNA test confirmed the blood was Skylar’s. 

That same day, Eddy was arrested in the parking lot of a Cracker Barrel restaurant in front of her mother.

On March 30, 2013, just before she was taken into custody, Eddy tweeted: 'We really did go on three.'

Eddy pleaded guilty to first-degree murder and was sentenced in January to life as part of a plea agreement that makes her eligible for parole after 15 years.

Shoaf, 17, pleaded guilty last May to second-degree murder in the July 2012 slaying. She'll be eligible for parole after 10 years.

During
 her sentencing, a tearful Rachel read a statement from the stand 
apologizing to Skylar’s parents, but Mary and Dave Neese did not believe
 a word she said. 

Rachel Shoaf pleaded guilty to murdering her friend Skylar Neese in July 2012 for no apparent reason other than she didn't want to be friends with her anymore. She was sentenced to 30 years in March (pictured)

Sheila Eddy, pictured in court in October, was sentenced to life in prison for the murder of her friend in March this year

‘You don’t apologize for murdering somebody in cold blood,‘ the father told 20/20.

Eddy refused to address the court 
other than to say 'guilty' - something that Mr Neese found 'unacceptable' at the time. 

Dave Neese now only has one thing to say to his daughter’s killers: ‘Rot in hell.’ 

Sheila and Rachel could be released from prison on good behavior by the time they are in their 30s.
