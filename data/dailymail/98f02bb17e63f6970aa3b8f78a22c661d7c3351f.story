It might not be pretty, but Mario Mandzukic’s latest Instagram post will certainly be a welcome sight for Atletico Madrid fans.

The 28-year-old posted a positive update from his hospital bed after successful surgery on a broken nose. Despite initial fears of a lengthy lay-off, the striker expects to return training on Monday.

Mandzukic suffered the injury in Tuesday’s surprise 3-2 defeat to Olympiacos, catching a stray elbow from midfielder Pajtim Kasami. 

Despite the blow, the Croatian played the full ninety minutes and managed to bag himself a goal. 

Mandzukic has netted on three occasions since making the move from Bayern Munich this summer.

After their midweek disappointment, Atletico Madrid will be looking to return to winning ways when they host Celta Vigo on Saturday.
