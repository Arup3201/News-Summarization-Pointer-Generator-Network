A benefits cheat who claimed he was so disabled that he could not turn over in bed was caught out after officials spotted him playing in the local football league.

Pete Iron pocketed more than £48,000 after telling welfare officers that he could only walk with a stick for 40 yards and fell frequently.

But undercover investigators filmed the  43-year-old – nicknamed Pistol Pete – putting in  energetic performances as the star midfielder  for Sunday league team Solent Lions FC.

The clip also proves Iron, pictured far right, is capable of sprinting and rolling over after receiving a direct blow to the groin from a football.

Iron, from St Helens, on the Isle of Wight, admitted failing to notify changes of circumstances to obtain benefits between 2005 and 2011 when he appeared before magistrates.

However, the bench decided its sentencing powers were not enough and he was committed to Newport Crown Court.

Sentencing him to six months in prison, suspended for a year, and a six-month community supervision order, Recorder John Trevaskis said: ‘I accept this claim did not start out as a fraudulent one but it was incumbent on you to notify your circumstances had changed.’

Iron is repaying the sum in £25 a week instalments, meaning he will be nearly 80 by the time his debt is cleared.

Prosecutor Rob Griffiths said Iron had claimed disability living allowance with a care component and mobility allowance.

Barry McElduff, defending, said Iron's GP confirmed his condition warranted the benefit when he first started claiming in 2000.

He admitted it later improved but said it had eased only to a point where his client would have still been entitled to a lower level of benefit.
