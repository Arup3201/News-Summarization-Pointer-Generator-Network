Three thieves raided a medieval pub, accidentally flooded the place - and then left a scribbled note apologising for the damage on their way out.

CCTV footage captures the crooks tearing through the Scotch Piper Inn in Merseyside, before getting away with the safe, spirits, cigarettes and a number of gadgets last Friday.

The grade II-listed building, which is one of the oldest pubs in the UK dating back to 1320, was left in a shocking state after the men ripped the boiler off the wall to steal the safe.

Thoughtful: Thieves scrawled an apology note on a work surface after accidentally flooding the pub when they ripped a boiler off the wall to get to the safe

Co-owners Phil Moran, 51, and Julie Pringle, had left the premises at midnight - just moments before the crooks struck.

After opening the doors to their ransacked pub the next morning, they discovered the message on a worktop in the serving area which read: 'Sorry tried to turn water off could not find it. Hope you fix pub.'

Mr Moran, 51, said: 'We were packed before closing up because we had a folk club night on - the car park was heaving all evening.

'We locked up at midnight and as you can see on the CCTV - the thieves were in and out minutes later.

'The place was an absolute mess - they'd taken the safe, bottles of spirits, packets of cigars and some of our gadgets.

Furious: Co-owners Phil Moran, 51, and Julie Pringle, were horrified by the damage caused in the raid

'They'd ripped the boiler which was on top of the safe off the wall which flooded the place - it was a total mess.

'They must have used some of our lifting equipment to shift the safe because that was missing too - they took everything they possible could.

'Then they had the cheek to leave that note behind after all of the damage they caused.' 

The men also got away with a Theoben Evolution.177 calibre air rifle which had a walnut stock and a Simmons Whitetail telescopic sight.

Mr Moran said: 'I only live around the corner and to come to the pub in the morning and see this sort of damage is horrific.

Brazen: The men stole the safe, bottles of spirits, packets of cigars and gadgets that were scattered around the pub

'It makes you wonder what the burglars were thinking. They clearly targeted us because they got away with so much stuff. 

'It's just a real shame because this pub is right at the heart of the local community - it's a very popular place.

'I just hope these people are caught and brought to justice.'

Officers have launched an appeal for anyone with information on the burglary, on October 24, to contact police.

A spokesperson for Merseyside Police said: 'We can confirm an investigation is underway following a burglary at the Scotch Piper Inn in Lydiate in the early hours of Friday, October 24.

'Officers were called to the pub on Southport Road at about 9.20am following a report a number of people had forced entry to the property between midnight and 9am that morning and attempted to take the safe.

'It is believed during the incident that damage was caused to the boiler causing water damage to the property.

'The offenders made off with a quantity of money and stock from the property. An investigation into the full circumstances of the incident is underway.

'Officers are checking CCTV from the property and surrounding areas in a bid to identify the people responsible.'

The pair took over the pub, which is a well-known meeting point for bikers, on March 31 this year.

Former Prime Minister Tony Blair sampled a pint of Burtonwood Bitter at the pub in 1999.
