A blind man who survived falling onto subway tracks and being run over by a train after his seeing-eye dog tried to save him, has been given a new guide dog.

Incredibly, Cecil Williams, 60, survived after falling onto the tracks at 125th Street in 
Harlem, New York, in December when he became dizzy.

His
 11-year-old black Labrador, Orlando, who had tried to hold him up, ended up falling with him and just as a train was approaching the station woke him by 
licking his face.

Christmas miracle: Cecil Williams was saved by his dog Orlando after the pair fell onto subway tracks and were run over by a train. Well wishers have donated $39,000 so Cecil can afford to keep Orlando once he retires

Wish granted: A blind man who fell onto the subway tracks gets a new dog

After the incident, Mr Williams said he 
wouldn't be able to keep his pet any longer because his dog was getting too old
 for guide dog work.

Thanks to the kindness of strangers, he 
is being allowed to keep Orlando, so he can put his paws up and relax, 
and Cecil has a new guide dog too, called Godiva.

$44,000 was received from well-wishers after an online campaign was launched to let him keep Orlando.

On the day of the incident, Mr Williams, clutching 
his dog, flattened himself in the space between the rails 
as the train moved into the station. The lead car passed over them, as 
terrified witnesses screamed for the train to stop.

The replacement: At 11 years old, Orlando became too old to be a working guide dog so after receiving $44,000 in donations, a dog entered the family

Orlando followed his owner down, barking 
for attention and huddling on top of Williams him as an oncoming train 
screeched to a halt just above them.

Horrified
 commuters watched as an employee of the MTA shouted down to Cecil as he
 sat upright on the tracks and said not to move and to lie down in the 
trench between the tracks.

The train driver slammed its breaks on and then rolled two carts over Orlando and Cecil.

The two managed to duck at the last minute and survived.

FDNY
 Capt. Danny Oâ€™Sullivan, a 17-year FDNY said someone must have been watching out for Williams and Orlando. 'We 
checked out under the train and found that he was not trapped; he was 
just in between the rails' 'It must have been a lucky day for him. It was 
definitely is a miracle.'

The new yellow Labrador has some pretty big paws to fill.

'Orlando
 was my angel. He's always been like that since  I got him. We work 
together, I protect him and he protects me,' said Mr Williams.

Loyal companions: Cecil and Orlando have been together for ten years but the dog will soon have to retire

At 11 years old, Orlando is now too old to be a working guide dog and Mr Williams could no longer afford to keep him.

Even now the thought of giving up his loyal friend brings him to tears.

'The
 spirit of goodwill, it still exists. In the world you see a lot of 
negative things but i try to focus on the positive,' he told The Today 
Show.

Thanks to some anonymous donors Mr Williams can now keep both dogs as Orlando move into retirement. At
 an emotional press conference last month, Cecil thanked strangers 
nationwide for their kindness saying, 'Orlando, he is my best buddy, 
he's my pal. I feel that it's a blessing, I feel that it's a miracle.

'All the people that contributed or donated, we should take our hat off to them. There's still good people in this world.

'I appreciate that people got together and helped me to keep Orlando. It is going to to cover him for the rest of his life.'
