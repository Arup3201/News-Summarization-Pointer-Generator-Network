Roy Keane has reignited his war of words with Jose Mourinho, again branding the Chelsea manager 'disgraceful' for attempting to shake his hand before the end of Aston Villa's 3-0 defeat at Stamford Bridge last month.

The Villa No 2 last week expressed his anger with Mourinho for disrespecting him and manager Paul Lambert before the final whistle, while the Portuguese responded by saying he would continue to try to shake hands before the end of matches.

On Tuesday, in an interview with the Evening Standard, former Manchester United captain Keane acknowledged Mourinho's success as a boss but also pointed out the money he has spent in his managerial career.

Keane said: 'He plays too many mind games but that’s fine. That’s up to himself. He’ll argue all day he can back it up with trophies. Of course, he can. But it helps when you’ve got players worth £300million.'

The Irishman also responded to Mourinho's claim that he was merely trying to boost sales of his new book when he initially came out and criticised the Chelsea boss.

'It has got nothing to do with the book,' insisted Keane. 'You shake hands with someone at the end of the game. I think it was disgraceful. But do you think I am some sort of robot on a PR trip to sell books?'

He added: 'If people want to shake my hand before the end of the game, whether it is Brendan Rodgers or Roberto Martinez, I’d say no. I think most people would say the same.'
