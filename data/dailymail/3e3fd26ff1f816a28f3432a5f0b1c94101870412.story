The Newcastle Knights finally had something to smile about when a last-minute conversion saw them beat out the Melbourne Storm after a hellish season which has seen them lose 13 games, their 'super coach' and a team mate to a wheelchair.

It was an emotional win for the Knights and it showed as they piled on top of each other in celebration on the field after Knights skipper Kurt Gidley slotted in a sideline conversion after the final siren at Newcastle's Hunter Stadium when team mate Akuila Uate dived over in the right-hand corner.

It was a crushing blow for the Storm, who were leading 30-20 in the 77th minute when winger Sisa Waqa scored his fourth try.

Knights players could not hide their joy at the win after a tumultuous year for the club

With just under two minutes remaining, the Knights looked no hope of victory as Melbourne worked the ball off their own line.

But the home side's Travis Waddell delivered a glimmer of hope when he stripped Billy Slater one-on-one in front of his posts and crossed under the posts.

The horror year for the Knights started after rising star Alex McKinnon's career ended when he suffered a devastating spinal injury confining him to a wheelchair in March

It was from there the Knights were able to claw back the points, and deliver a 32-30 win.

2013 has been a tumultuous year for the embattled Newcastle Knights whose first blow of the season came in Round 3 of the NRL premiership series.

In March, rising star Alex McKinnon's career ended when a horrific tackle during a clash against the Storm left him with a devastating spinal injury, which confined him to a wheelchair.

More bad news followed when Nathan Tinkler relinquished ownership of the club in May after it emerged coach Wayne Bennett and players were not being paid on time, leaving the club in millions worth of debt - according to The Sydney Morning Herald.

In a statement through Hunter Sports Group - owned by the mining magnate - Mr Tinkler rebuffed reports the club had liabilities amounting to $20 million and added it was 'substantially less' than the $10.5 million the group had in its coffers.

But the final nail in the coffin came from 'super coach' Wayne Bennett who announced he would be leaving the Knights last month at the end of the season and return to the club where he won six premierships, the Brisbane Broncos.

Of his decision to discontinue his post as coach after the change of ownership left him open to re-negotiate his contract, Bennett said the Knights were a long way from reaching a premiership and he was unable to commit to the number of years it would take to get them into that position.

The bad year continued with mining magnate Nathan Tinkler ending his ownership of the Knights, sparking a re-negotiation of 'super coach' Wayne Bennett's contract - who decided to leave the club in July

'I believe it will take a number of years to reach an acceptable position and that is what I am unable to commit to,' he said at the time of the announcement in a statement on the Newcastle Knights website.

'A longer term coach is crucial for future success.'

His decision to end his tenure with the club came just days before Bennett revealed he had lost interest in football after Alex McKinnon's tragic accident.

Fighting off tears during an interview with The Footy Show on July 17, the normally stoic coach said he cared about his players but 'didn't really care whether we won or lost' in the weeks after the 22-year-old was left unable to walk.

'Football was still important to me, but it wasn't that important,' he told the show's Erin Molan.

Saturday night's game also saw Knights back-rower Chris Houston celebrate his 150th NRL game.
