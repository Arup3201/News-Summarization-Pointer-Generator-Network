Dinosaurs breathed through their noses to smell their surroundings and cool their brains, experts claim.

They made their discovery after reconstructing how dinosaurs breathed for the first time.

The study explains how the prehistoric creatures used their heavy, moist breaths to smell their surroundings and hints at why most of the land-roaming giants had long snouts.

Sixty five million years after they last drew their breath, 3D computer models of the inside of dinosaurs’ nostrils have revealed how air moved though their nasal passages.

The research was based on the discovery of perfectly preserved soft tissues within the nasal cavities of the remains of Cretaceous pachycephalosaurids or ‘pachy’ - small plant-eating dinosaurs known for their thick bony skulls.

CT scans of a Canadian pachy called Stegoceras gave scientists a glimpse of the internal structures in unprecedented detail, including the animals’s long narrow bones called turbinates in the back of the nose and a bony ridge in the front.

The research team were struck at how the dinosaur had similar nasal structures to a modern day ostrich or alligator.

‘Dinosaurs were pretty "nosy" animals. Figuring out what’s going on in their complicated snouts is challenging because noses have so many different functions,’ Jason Bourke, a doctoral student at Ohio University, explained.

‘It doesn’t help all the delicate soft tissues rotted away millions of years ago.’

The experts looked to the creature’s modern-day relatives for clues, such as birds, crocodiles and lizards.

Pachycephalosaurus means 'thick headed lizard' in Greek, because of their thick skulls,

Their skulls are up to 10 inches (25cm) thick to cushion their tiny brains.

The rear of the dome has bony knobs and blunt spikes.

It is thought they used their tough heads to fight each other, although this claim has been disputed.

They were around 15ft (4.5 metres) long and weighed around 990lbs (450kg).

The animals lived during the Late Cretaceous Period in what is now North America.

The dinosaurs ate mostly plants and moved on two legs.

They were one of the last non-avian dinosaurs before the Cretaceous–Paleogene extinction event. The new study sheds lights on how pachys breathed. 

Professor Lawrence Witmer said: ‘We did lots of dissections, blood-vessel injections and CT scanning - but a major new tool was 3D computer simulation of airflow.’

Mr Bourke used a branch of engineering called computational fluid dynamics to model and understand how air flowed through the noses of modern-day relatives of dinosaurs.

‘Once we got a handle on how animals today breathe, the tricky part was finding a good candidate among dinosaurs to test our methods, he said.

The scientists decided on pachys and quickly found delicate scrolls of bone in the nasal region of one specimen from North Dakota, which were nasal turbinates. Similar structures were found in Stegoceras.

The first nasal turbinates to be discovered in that species were in the back part of the nasal cavity, called the olfactory chamber, where smelling takes place.

CT scans revealed that the olfactory region of the brain was quite large, which, along with the large olfactory turbinates, suggested that Stegoceras had a good sense of smell.

But when Mr Bourke ran his airflow simulation analyses, the inspired air bypassed the olfactory chamber. ‘It made no sense,’ he said.

‘Stegoceras obviously had a pretty decent sense of smell, but the odours weren't reaching where they needed to go. We obviously were missing a piece of the puzzle.’

That missing puzzle piece was hinted at by a long bony ridge on the wall of the front of the nasal cavity.

In the modern-day relatives of dinosaurs, cartilaginous nasal turbinates often attach to such ridges, suggesting to the team that pachys may have had turbinates in the front, respiratory part of the nasal cavity.

When Bourke digitally inserted respiratory turbinates of different shapes- including the scrolled turbinate of a turkey and the branched turbinate of an ostrich - the computer airflow simulations started to make more sense.

‘Some of the restored airflow patterns now carried odours to the olfactory region,’ he said.

‘We don't really know what the exact shape of the respiratory turbinate was in Stegoceras, but we know some kind of baffle had to be there.

‘We have the smoking gun of the bony ridge on the fossil and the airflow analyses show that attaching some kind of turbinate produced the only airflow that made any real biological sense.’

The study suggests that pachys had turbinates not only to help them smell, but to cool their brains.

Study co-author Ruger Porter, said: ‘The fossil evidence suggests that Stegoceras was basically similar to an ostrich or an alligator.’

‘Hot arterial blood from the body was cooled as it passed over the respiratory turbinates, and then that cooled venous blood returned to the brain. It may not have been much of a brain, but you don't want it cooked!’

The team is now trying to work out how other dinosaurs breathed.
