Wanted: Police believe Eugene Palmer, 73, is still alive and on the run after shooting his daughter-in-law dead after a false lead this weekend

Bones that were initially believed to belong to a missing fugitive have now been identified as animal remains.

Eugene Palmer went on the run after allegedly shooting his daughter-in-law on September 24, 2012.

After the shooting, Eugene is believed to have fled into Harriman State Park where he had previously worked as a park ranger.

There was a false breakthrough in the case over the weekend after Eugene's son Clarence consulted a psychic who led them to a collection of bones inside the woods.

Clarence and other relatives disputed earlier police reports which claimed Eugene was still alive, saying that he would have died by now given his diabetes, dementia and undisclosed heart condition.

On Saturday, the group found a forearm, parts of a shoulder and portions of fingers that they then called in to police.

LoHud newspaper reports that police spent three hours investigating the scene and testing the bones before determining that they once belonged to an animal and not the elderly fugitive.

'I thought we were closing in on him, but that’s not the case,' Clarence's friend Kevin Rose told the paper.

'Personally, I think it was a bear... It had five fingers.'

The search for Eugene was launched after the death of his 39-year-old daughter-in-law Tammy.

Harassed:

Killed: Tammy Palmer, pictured right with her two children, was shot dead on Monday September 24 after walking her children to a school bus stop

He remains the sole suspect after allegedly confessing to the crime to his sister. He was charged with the murder two months after she was killed.

He is believed to have taken off into the 46,613-acre park and his relatives have complained that they feel the police investigation into his whereabouts has dropped off over time.

'We thoroughly searched these woods over the course of two weeks, I don't believe he's here,' Sgt. George Lutz of the Haverstraw Police Department told Fox News in May.  

'He knows that park like the back of his hand.'

His truck was found in nearby Harriman State Park on the same day Tammy was killed and officers began their search for him..

Tammy Palmer's family claimed that 
Eugene Palmer had begun a campaign of harassment against her after the 
39-year-old took out an order of protection against her estranged 
husband, John.

The order 
prevented him from entering the home where she was raising their two 
children, aged 12 and 16. She lived in a separate house but on the same 
property as her father-in-law.

The suspect's sister, Elaine Babcock, claimed he rushed to her house straight after the killing and admitted what he'd done.

'He just came in and said, "Here’s money to pay my taxes with, I’ve had enough.

'I
shot and killed Tammy. Give me an hour to get away and then do whatever
you have to do — call the police... whatever you have to do," and then 
he just took off,' Babcock told CBS.

Babcock said she immediately called police.
