Hull City's £10million Uruguayan striker has attracted little attention on the pitch since his summer move from Palermo. 

But off it, his spectacular thatch has whipped up a Twitter storm with fans bemused at his change of appearance in the space of a week.

The forward took to the pitch with short cropped hair when the Tigers faced Swansea on December 20. 

But only eight days later during the match at home to Leicester City, he sported shoulder-length dreadlocks worn in a ponytail.

The striker, with his new hair style, was voted man of the match in the New Year's Day clash against Everton

His dramatic change in appearance attracted attention on Twitter from baffled and amused supporters

The dramatic contrast baffled supporters on Twitter. Niall Murray wrote: 'Hernandez was definitely bald a week ago now he has a fully grown wig?' 

Lee Scott quipped: 'Where the hell did Abel Hernandez's hair come from? Hope for the bald everywhere.' 

Referring to Wayne Rooney's hair transplant, Mike Brown said: 'Rooney spends a fortune trying to get hair back, Hernandez goes from fully bald to massive pony tail in a week. Life's weird.' 

Hernandez - who is Hull City's record signing - has only mustered three goals since his switch to Yorkshire in the summer. 

The Uruguayan is not the first footballer to sport an eye-opening hairstyle. 

Former Nottingham Forest striker Jason Lee lopped off his hair after being mercilessly ribbed by opposing supporters for the 'pineapple' on his head. 

At the 1998 World Cup Finals, the Romanian national side famously lined up with peroxide blonde hair for a match against Tunisia. 

Four years later, Brazilian icon Ronaldo shaved his head but elected to keep a fuzzy fringe on his forehead.

Other famous footballing hair-dos include Nigeria defender Taribo West's two blonde tufts, former England ace Chris Waddle's mullet and West Ham's Javier Margas' shocking pink thatch.
