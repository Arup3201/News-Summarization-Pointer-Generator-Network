While Liverpool are chasing MK Dons teenager Dele Alli, the central midfielder is aiming to replicate Kop hero Steven Gerrard by netting his first England goal against Germany.

England Under 19s take on Germany in Dusseldorf on Monday evening and childhood Liverpool fan Alli is intent on following in the footsteps of his idol by scoring his first international goal against the nation's bitter rivals.

Alli, who is also being monitored by Chelsea, Manchester City, Arsenal and Manchester United, said: 'It’s something I have been thinking about.

Kop hero: Alli hopes to replicate Steven Gerrard by scoring his first international goal against Germany

I’ve had a few chances when I’ve been playing for England and I feel like they’ve been easy chances, but I’ve just been messing up so I can’t wait to get off the mark. I am actually a Liverpool fan and Gerrard is someone I look up to massively.'

Gerrard's debut England strike back in 2001 was a beauty. David Beckham crossed from the right, Rio Ferdinand nodded the ball back and the Liverpool star controlled it with his chest before firing into the bottom left corner from 25 yards. 

In an unforgettable night it put England 2-1 ahead, just before half-time, before they went on to thrash the Germans 5-1.

Alli added: 'If the ball drops for me on Monday like it did for him against Germany, I’m smashing it. If I get the goal I’ll obviously be happy but the win is all that matters.'

MK Dons manager Karl Robinson claims Alli, who impressed during the Dons' emphatic 4-0 win over Manchester United in the Capital One Cup, is one of the most talented teenagers the country has ever produced. 

The club did well to hold on to him when Liverpool thought that a £3.5million offer would seal a move. If Alli's own description of himself is anything to go by, the Barclays Premier League is in for a treat when he finally makes it there. 

He joked: '[Tottenham midfielder] Harry Winks and I were talking about who I play like and he was trying to tell me I’m like Fernandinho but I’m not having that I’d prefer to think I’m a cross between Gerrard and Yaya Toure.'
