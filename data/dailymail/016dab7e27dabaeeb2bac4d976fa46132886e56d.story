Four years after undergoing brain surgery, American JB Holmes has a golden opportunity to put the seal on his heartening recovery by claiming the biggest title of his career on Sunday.

The huge-hitting Kentucky native served notice he was bang in form when he opened up the WGC-Cadillac Championship here with a startling round of 62 – described by Johnny Miller on American television on Saturday as one of the great rounds of the last 20 years.

It seemed to catch up with Holmes when he put four balls into the water on Friday and started with an ugly three putt from just 5ft at the first hole of his third round.

Holmes, who leads the WGC-Cadillac Championship by five shots, had brain surgery four years ago

For the first time since Thursday he did not own the lead outright and, with players of the calibre of Dustin Johnson, Henrik Stenson and Masters champion Bubba Watson lurking, there were fears he would fall back still further.

But the 32 year old showed commendable resolve to put that opening hole mistake behind him and play wonderfully patient golf thereafter to finish up with a 70 on Saturday and establish a commanding five shot advantage.

With Johnson and Watson his nearest pursuers, Holmes won’t be spending the mammoth £1.25 million first prize just yet. But the manner in which he finished off his round, with four birdies in a row from the 14th hole, augurs well for his chances.

Lee Westwood is best placed of the Brits in 8th place but a long way off the pace, at eight shots behind. Rory McIlroy is no fewer than 11 strokes adrift and admitted he had little to play for but a top five finish in the final round.

After a difficult start on Saturday Holmes remained patient to hold onto his lead going into the final round

‘I felt like I hit it a little better but my iron play is still not as sharp as I would like it to be,’ said the world No 1.

An unusually wet and windy third round made it tough for the players, with only Johnson (69) managing to break 70 among the last 12 groups. Yet there were a remarkable number of perfect shots played.

Take the par three fourth, a hole so long and difficult there hadn’t been a hole in one there for 26 years. Yet on this day, almost unbelievably, there were two in the space of 30 minutes, as first Johnson holed his tee shot, to be followed by the leader himself shortly afterwards.

He might have had an ace but Holmes would get to the 14th without a birdie on his card. At that point, however, he broadened his shoulders and put together his brilliant finish that has left the tournament as one for him to win or lose on Sunday.

After shooting an 80 in the USPGA Championship in 2011 Holmes withdrew and, suffering from vertigo symptoms, went to see a neurologist. He was eventually diagnosed with structural defects in his cerebellum and underwent two gruelling bouts of surgery.

Last May, Holmes confirmed his full recovery with an emotional victory in the Wells Fargo Championship in North Carolina. Now he has the chance to register an even more prestigious victory.

The huge advantage this Blue Monster course offers the big hitters was made plain by the identities of the top three. In fact, they might be the three biggest hitters in the modern game.

Lee Westwood is the best-placed Brit, but his eight shots back and tied for eighth place after three rounds

Johnson and Watson are showing just why they will be heavily favoured at the Masters next month, when the latter will be trying to win a third green jacket in four years. 

If he shows the same gossamer touch as he has here, he must have a great chance. He is the only player in the field to break par in every round.

Westwood is playing in his 50th WGC event but it is a long shot that it will end in his first victory. Still, he is showing good form as well heading to Augusta. 

Sergio Garcia stands alongside Westwood, with Irishman Shane Lowry a further shot off the lead. 

But Welshman Jamie Donaldson, runner-up here last year, fell away following a disappointing round of 76.
