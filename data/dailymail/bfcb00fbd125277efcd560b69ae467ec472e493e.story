Plea: Starbucks Coffee CEO Howard Schultz, pictured above, has written an open letter to customers in the US asking them not to bring guns into their cafes

Starbucks will not enforce a US wide ban on guns in their stores, despite another mass shooting in America this week.

The coffee chain has been forced to state its position on the gun debate which has been reignited after crazed gunman Aaron Alexis shot 12 people dead in a Washington Navy yard this week.

Most US states allow people to carry 
licensed guns and many companies, including the Seattle based cafe giant, do not have laws banning 
firearms in their stores.

Due to their lenient stance Starbucks has become a popular meeting place for the right-wing pro-firearms lobby.

Some groups stage "Starbucks Appreciation Days," in which gun lovers turn up at the cafes and order drinks while proudly carrying their weapons.

Rifle clubs have filmed their meet ups before posting the videos on Youtube.

In one clip, a gun enthusiast can be seen sipping from a Starbucks cup with a pistol on his hip.

One website even sells products bearing
an altered version of the Starbucks logo, with the siren holding up a 
gun in each hand with the words "I Love Guns & Coffee."

The growing link between the coffee brand and gun owners has forced bosses to act.

In an interview, Starbucks CEO Howard Schultz said anyone carrying a firearm would be 'unwelcome' in Starbucks but he confirmed the chain would stop short of banning the weapons completely.

Unwelcome: Starbucks have said that gun-toting customers make others feel uncomfortable

Schultz said the pro-gun meetings had 
'made our customers uncomfortable', adding: 'to be clear: we do not want
these events in our stores.'

He is hoping armed customers will respect the companies wishes, but when asked how staff would deal with those carrying guns, he said: "We will not ask you to leave".

Support: t-shirts like the one shown above are popular with pro-gun lobbyists who meet at Starbucks

In a memo circulated to staff, Starbucks workers have been told not to confront gun owners or ask them to leave simply for being armed.

Starbucks has bought advertising space in major US newspapers this week to publish an open letter from Schultz.

But although the letter states their opposition to guns, it also confirms that the company will be standing by its position that the decision to ban guns should be left to lawmakers

Critics of Starbucks have highlighted several American companies who do not allow firearms in their stores.

Peet's Coffee & Tea and Whole Foods say they have had no trouble enforcing their gun bans.

Shannon Watts, founder of the gun reform group Moms Demand Action, questioned why Starbucks has taken strong stances on other issues such as smoking.

Earlier this year the company banned smoking within 25 feet of its cafes with the idea being to extend its no-smoking policy to the outdoor seating areas.
