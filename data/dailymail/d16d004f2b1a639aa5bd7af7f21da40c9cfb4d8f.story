The family of Sir Arthur Conan Doyle, pictured, have been accused of extortion for charging authors to use his characters

A judge has accused the family of Sherlock Holmes creator Sir Arthur Conan Doyle of extortion by charging authors a fee to use his most famous characters.

Heirs to the literary rights of the author had filed an appeal with the U.S. Supreme Court in a bid to stop the publication of a book based on the characters Sherlock Holmes and Dr Watson, insisting they must pay a license to use the characters.

But a judge in the US has ruled that due to the copyright expiring on all but the last ten Sherlock Holmes stories, charging publishers and authors to use the characters amounted to extortion.

According to the Times, Judge Richard Posner of the Seventh Circuit Court of Appeals made the comments after author Leslie Klinger refused to pay for the licence in his new book, In The Company of Sherlock Holmes.

Previously he had ruled against the estate's argument and said Mr Klinger was free to use the characters.

Now the judge has criticised the estate and ordered it to pay $30,000 in costs.

Judge Posner said: The Doyle estate's business strategy is plain; charge a modest fee for which there is no legal basis, in the hope that the 'rational' writer or publisher will pay it rather than incur a greater cost in challenging the legality of the demand.

'It's time the estate changed its business model.'

However, lawyers for the estate said they were considering an appeal and said the judge's comments were out of touch. 

Mr Kilnger had previously paid for the licence in his first book A Study In Sherlock, even though he didn't believe he needed to.

But he refused to pay a second time, which led to legal action.

Doyle wrote four novels and 56 short stories about the London-based sleuth which were published in the U.S. between 1887 and 1927.

U.S. copyright protection for the novels and the first 46 stories has lapsed and they are now in the public domain, but the final ten stories remain under copyright.

Mr Klinger argued that the essential characteristics of Holmes and Watson, played by Benedict Cumberbatch and Martiin Freeman in the BBC show,  were established in the works already in the public domain

For his latest book, Mr Klinger refused to pay and in June a federal appeals court in Chicago ruled in his favour, sparking the latest court action.

At the time Judge Posner wrote: 'When a story falls into the public domain, story elements - including characters covered by the expired copyright - become fair game for follow-on authors.' 

Mr Klinger argued that the essential characteristics of Holmes and Watson were established in the works already in the public domain. Therefore, he says, he and his team are free to write new works based on them.

In Britain, works are protected for 70 years after an author's death meaning the works are long out of copyright.
