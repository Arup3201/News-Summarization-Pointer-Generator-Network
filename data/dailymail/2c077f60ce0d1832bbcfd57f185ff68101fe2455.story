A growing number of spoof videos of men pretending to pick up women in bizarre ways have appeared on YouTube, including one where nude man wanders the streets with an erection asking for phone numbers.

While some say the trend displays harassing behavior, others think it's just good fun.

As shocking as their behavior appears, these men have a surprising success rate.

Presumptuous: As part of a trend in YouTube videos where men ask women out in odd ways, FreddieFairhair asks women for their numbers while nude

By far the most forward of all these videos is Naked Guy Picking Up Girls.

The title of the spoof says it all: a naked man who calls himself Freddie Fairhair approaches women on the street and asks for their number.

Not surprisingly, most of the women looks completely shocked.

A helper stands by with a microphone to get the women's reactions.

Some immediately turn around and walk away, gasp, and one duo of girls yelps, 'Holy s**t!'

Most of the women make their disinterest known.

'Many of the women he ambushes laugh it off,' writes the Daily Dot. 'But that doesn’t make his invasion of women’s space any less troubling.'

Nevertheless, some actually warm up to the naked man.

'You can have my number if you like,' says one woman.

Fairhair approaches another group of women who he apparently especially likes.

'I'm actually standing here having a 
boner,' he tells as just laugh at him. 'You turn me on. Is it visible? I
don't want to look.'

Another spoof, from YouTube channel Whatever, features a similar stunt. Clothed men walk around asking women for their numbers while outfitted with prosthetic erections.

'I'm gonna throw up': While most of the women laugh off the prank, some were suitably offended

'Can I have your number,' asks one of the men.

'No,' the girls says. 'I'm gonna throw up,' says her friend.

They're the exceptions in what the jokesters call an 'experiment,' at least in the women they chose to include in the spoof.

Many of the women gladly give the men a phone number. Whether or not it is the girl's number remains unclear.

'This experiment is null and void,' writes YouTube user Graxster, 'without the actual statistics of﻿ how many women put their REAL phone number in the phone.'
