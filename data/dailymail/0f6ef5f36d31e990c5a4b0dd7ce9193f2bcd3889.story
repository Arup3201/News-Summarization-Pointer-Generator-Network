Stuart Nelson was in the dugout recalling his heroics from that evening when, through a gap in the stands, he saw a coach drive off in the corner of his eye.

The 33-year-old was recounting, excitedly, the best night of his career; his 100th appearance for Gillingham, a first game back from injury in two months, how he had thrown his hat in the ring for a penalty, saved two, then struck the decisive one as they knocked Colchester out of the Johnstone's Paint Trophy.

Halfway through speaking to the local press and club media after the game at Weston Homes Community Stadium on Tuesday night, he was sure it could not possibly be his team coach departing for the 70-mile journey back.

'I could see through the corner of the stand a coach in the distance leaving,' Nelson recalls. 'It was dark, but I could just make it out. I was still talking and in the back of my mind I thought, “Nah it can't be ours.”'

Afterwards, Nelson headed back to the changing room to find everyone and rejoin their celebrations which would continue on the coach back. But only those sorting out kit and equipment who travel in a separate transit van remained.

He asked the club's sports scientist James Russell where everyone was. 'His face dropped,' Nelson says, laughing. 'He knew it had gone. He said he would call them back, if I wasn't sorted they would've come back, but I told him it's fine I'll get a lift.

'You couldn't knock me that night, if I had to walk back I would have done. I would've floated.

'I was on cloud nine. I was buzzing, it's one of those night's in football you never forget.

'It was a dream comeback for me. As a 'keeper you don't get many times where you score the winner.

'You're there to save and you can only save what's in front of you. For it to all work out that way was special.'

Nelson jumped into the back of a Volkswagen with the club's media officer Phill Catterick, club photographer Barry Goodwin and Kent Messenger reporter Luke Cawdell.

Most of the team were part of a group message on WhatsApp Messenger – they had all bought EuroMillions tickets for that night and used it to see if anyone had won – and Nelson text them saying he could not believe he had been left behind.

'I got a lot of abuse from the boys,' Nelson explains. 'Everyone on there was laughing. I think some of the players stitched up our assistant manager Andy Hessenthaler, it's his job to count everyone on the bus.

'I sit right at the back and maybe some of them told him I was already on there.'

With all the jokes aside, Gillingham still had an internal investigation as to what went wrong, to make sure it does not happen again. The punishment, however, was not as serious.

'The way we deal with things is we put the man on the centre spot at the training ground and balls are put all the way around the centre circle,' Nelson reveals. 'Then all the players pelt them at him.

'Hessey took a few off the lads. Some of the culprits that stitched him up must've got to do it! It was a bit of fun. It's all done and dusted.'

Although this is the first time Nelson has been left behind by the team bus, it was not the first time he scored the winner in a penalty shoot-out.

In a League Cup match for Brentford, away to Swindon in 2006, he saved one, saw another fly over the bar and stepped up, again, to bag the winner.

'I'm always up for taking penalties,' he explains. 'I strike the ball well. But they don't come around much for a 'keeper, it depends who wants to take one.'

That night, he managed to make it on the bus home. Missing one will surely not happen again at Gillingham on Hessenthaler's watch.

'He'll make sure he walks up to the back of the coach next time and not trust the boys,' Nelson jokes.
