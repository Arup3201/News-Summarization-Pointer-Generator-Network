New Jersey Republican Governor Chris Christie has blamed the GOP's electoral problems on 'bad decision-making and a loss of courage' by the party's national leaders.

In a stinging attack on Washington, the potential 2016 presidential candidate told an audience of CEOs last night that 'everyone down here in DC has failed' to lead the country.

He did not single out anyone by name, but criticised the Republican Party's reliance on grassroots supporters rather than reaching out to independent and Hispanic voters.

'Our country is changing, demographically and economical.

'Candidates have to understand who they're asking to lead,' he added in obvious frustration that the party hadn't done more to attract minority groups, reported the Huffington Post.

He said campaigns that are solely based on appealing to white Republican voters 'aren't working'.

Christie also turned on Barack Obama's health care overhaul which he branded a 'failure' and predicted it 'will not succeed - it just won't.'

Christie said the leaders of both political parties, including Obama, are to blame for a 16-day partial federal government shutdown in October.

He says the effort by some Republicans to defund the so-called Obamacare law by shutting down the government had failed, while 'absolutists' from both parties also hurt the process.

But Christie avoided addressing a question on how to fix the law, saying it was a complex issue that required a robust debate.

He was interviewed Monday during a forum sponsored by The Wall Street Journal.

He is scheduled to take over the chairmanship of the Republican Governors Association later this week.
