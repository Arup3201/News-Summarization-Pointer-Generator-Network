Burnley have announced the double signing of striker Marvin Sordell from Bolton and former West Ham midfielder Matt Taylor.

Sordell has made his switch for an undisclosed fee, the 23-year-old agreeing a deal that could keep him at Turf Moor until 2017.

On the ball: Bolton striker Sordell has moved to Turf Moor for an undisclosed fee

He spent last season on loan from Bolton at Charlton, for whom he scored eight goals, and has been capped 14 times for England Under-21s.

Sordell previously worked under Burnley boss Sean Dyche at Watford, the club with whom he made his Football League debut.

Taylor, 32, has put pen to paper on a two-year deal with the Clarets after the conclusion this summer of his West Ham contract.

He is another ex-Bolton man and played for Portsmouth before that.

Those arrivals are the second and third this week for Burnley after they announced on Wednesday that former Blackpool goalkeeper Matt Gilks had joined them.

The other player to sign for them this summer has been Michael Kightly, who had been on loan from Stoke last term and has now made the move permanent.

Burnley are preparing for their return to the Premier League after clinching promotion from the Sky Bet Championship at the end of 2013/14.
