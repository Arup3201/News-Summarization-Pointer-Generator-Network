When it came to winning first prize, J.D. Megchelsen thought the trophy for growing the largest pumpkin was his for the taking.

At 1,500-pounds and requiring a truck and crane to even move the fruit, Mr Megchelsen believed he had likely secured first prize a new Alaska state record.

But there was a hole in his plan. For despite months of tender, loving-care, all his work was for nothing after he noticed a thumb-sized hole at the bottom his gigantic pumpkin.

Pumped up: J.D. Megchelsen poses next to his giant pumpkin in Alaska. J.D. Megchelsen holds the record for giant pumpkins in Alaska, and knew he had a candidate this year to beat the record of 1,287 pounds set by him in 2011

There's a hole in my pumpkin! When a boom truck gently lifted the behemoth, the big pumpkin revealed a big disappointment: a thumb-size hole that will make it ineligible for the competition at the Alaska State Fair in Palmer

‘‘It’s not going to count,’ he said. ‘It’s a bummer, but it’s the rules.’

The rules state that ‘entries must be free of rot, holes and cracks that reach through to the cavity, chemical residues and serious soft spots.’

Mr Megchelsen is the current state record holder for giant pumpkin growing and his 1,287-pound effort from 2011 will likely stand even after this year’s competition at the Alaska State Fair is over.

 ‘It’s just killing him,’ said Pam Elkins, Megchelsen’s sister-in-law told the Peninsular Clarion.

Judging: The Alaska State Fair pumpkin competition judging in Palmer in full swing (and sling!)

Winner: Anchorage's Dale Marshall who hauled in a pale orange 1,182-pound monster for the top prize won this year - but he knows what J.D. Megchelsen is feeling. He was disqualified a few years ago also for having a hole in his pumpkin

‘He eats, sleeps and dreams pumpkins. All he does is pumpkins.’

Mr Megchelsen has gotten used to setting records for growing massive pumpkins.

He set his first record in 2004 with a 700-pounder and again in 2005 with a 942-pound pumpkin.

In 2006, he grew the first Alaska pumpkin to pass the 1,000-pound mark and then set the current record in 2011 with an enormous 1,287 pounder.

Mr Megchelsen was disqualified once before when a crack was discovered in one of his giants.

He believes the hole that occurred this time around may have happened because it was growing ‘too fast’.

Operation: Just getting the pumpkins to the state fair is quite an ordeal in itself!

Better luck next year: The seeds from J.D. Megchelsen enormous pumpkin will likely be auctioned off for other growers to use

At one point, he was feeding the pumpkin 300 gallons of water a day and grew more 40 pounds in 24 hours.

It took less than three months for the fruit to grow to its present size and started off about the size of a cherry tomato at the start of June.

It’s not clear what will become of the fruit. The seeds may go at auction for a few hundred dollars.

There could be anywhere from zero to 900 inside

In the end it was Anchorage's Dale Marshall who hauled in a pale orange 1,182-pound monster for the top prize.

He had sympathy for Mr Megchelsen position. Just a couple of years ago Mr Marshall grew a pumpkin weighing 1,789 pounds but was disqualified for a small hole.

‘J.D. had a bigger pumpkin,’ Marshall said. ‘I know what he's feeling.’
