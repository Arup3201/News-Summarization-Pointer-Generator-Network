Arsenal manager Arsene Wenger has revealed his World Cup winning trio will almost certainly miss the Premier League opener against Crystal Palace.

Mesut Ozil, Per Mertesacker and Lukas Podolski are on a well-deserved break after helping Germany to success in Brazil.

The threesome will not return to pre-season training until August 11, just five days prior to the clash against Tony Pulis' side.

And Wenger says his world champions are likely to miss the start of the season.

The
 Frenchman said: 'I have given them a good break because I have 
experience of players who have been in the World Cup final. You need a 
rest.

'Will they be ready? Mertesacker prepares well - but for the first game I don't think they will be ready for August 16.'

Wenger 
 - who refused to confirm whether he has disciplined Jack Wilshere for 
being photographed smoking in Las Vegas - has also hinted that FIFA must
 rethink their post-World Cup timetable given the difficulties he will 
be facing with his squad.

'A
 post-World Cup year is always very difficult and short, the World Cup 
final was July 13th and the start of the Premier League is August 16,' 
said Wenger.

'From FIFA we 
are obliged to give four weeks holiday to the players, so I don't know 
how all that works together. It looks impossible to me.

'A post-World Cup year is always very difficult for every big club because the players have been away.'

Meanwhile, Wenger has joined Manchester United manager Louis van Gaal in revealing his scepticism of long-haul pre-season trips.

Despite the commercial gain, Van Gaal claims long distance summer tours are not beneficial for the development of his team.

And Wenger added: 'Sometimes our training camps are decided for commercial reasons to extend the popularity of the club.

'We
 have been to Asia, of course, and we have many fans there. This is the 
first time for us to come to the States and I'm very happy we can come 
to New York because its a city I love.

'But
 for purely football reasons the best for football is not to travel too 
much because of the time you have to wait and the jet lag is not ideal.'
