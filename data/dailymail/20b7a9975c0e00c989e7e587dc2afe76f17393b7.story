Champions Bayern Munich ended SC Paderborn 07's dream start to the season with a 4-0 demolition of the Bundesliga new-boys on Tuesday at the Allianz Arena, as Mario Gotze netted twice and new signing Robert Lewandowski got off the mark.

Thomas Muller got the fourth in the closing stages.

The win lifted Bayern two points clear at the top on 11 from five games, ahead of Mainz  who drew 2-2 against Eintracht Frankfurt.

Minnows Paderborn, whose budget is €5million  a year, had arrived in Munich as unexpected league leaders after two wins and two draws in their first four games, taking the top division by storm in their maiden season.

But Bayern, despite missing several players through injury, handed out an attacking lesson.

Germany international Gotze put the hosts ahead, drilling in after a cute back-flick assist from Thomas Muller in the eighth minute.

Last season's Bundesliga top scorer Lewandowski, who joined Bayern from rivals Borussia Dortmund, opened his account six minutes later with a superb shot from the just outside the box.

Still missing winger Franck Ribery and playmaker Bastian Schweinsteiger among several absentees, Bayern looked sharper than in Saturday's goalless draw at Hamburg  and should have had at least two more goals by half-time.

Gotze tapped in from close range in the 78th to more accurately reflect Bayern's dominance before Muller completed a well-worked move five minutes from time.

Elsewhere, Schalke bounced back from a bad start to clinch their first win of the campaign with a 3-0 victory over Werder Bremen.

Borussia Dortmund, on six points, host rock bottom Stuttgart while Bayer Leverkusen, a point ahead, entertain Augsburg on Wednesday.
