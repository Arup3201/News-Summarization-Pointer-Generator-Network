Joran Van der Sloot’s long-awaited murder trial was today delayed for five days after the Dutch citizen said he wasn’t yet ready to plead over the killing of a Peruvian woman he met in a casino.

The 24-year-old defendant allegedly killed Stephany Flores, 21, who was a top poker player and the daughter of a wealthy businessman, in his hotel room in Lima, Peru, in May 2010.

Van der Sloot rose to fame when he became the prime suspect in the unsolved 2005 killing on the Dutch Caribbean island Aruba of U.S. citizen Natalee Holloway, of Mountain Brook, Alabama.

He shook his head on Friday as the prosecutor 
detailed the case against him in the Ms Flores case and when asked how he 
would plead, Van der Sloot answered in rudimentary Spanish.

‘I want to give a sincere confession, 
but I don't agree with all the charges that has placed on me (sic) by 
the prosecutor,’ he told the court. ‘Can I have more time to think about
this?’

Judge Victoria Montoya agreed to the postponement at the San Jorge jail in Lima until January 11.

His defence lawyer had said on Friday 
that his client would plead guilty, according to Reuters. But Jose Luis 
Jimenez told the Associated Press there is now a 70 per cent chance he 
will plead guilty.

vest beneath the jacket. He sported a crew cut and wore a long-sleeved 
grey shirt.

'We hope that throughout this process 
our attorneys can demonstrate the true motives for the killing of my 
daughter'

Ricardo Flores

Ms Flores's father, Ricardo Flores, 
said on Friday that the family would participate in the trial in the 
hope of ensuring Van der Sloot is also accused of robbery in connection 
with the killing.

‘We hope that throughout this process 
our attorneys can demonstrate the true motives for the killing of my 
daughter,’ he said. Prosecutors want a 30-year jail sentence for murder 
and theft.

But Mr Jimenez will argue that his 
client was in a state of emotional distress when he killed Flores and 
wants to reduce the charge to simple homicide, which carries a jail 
sentence of up to 20 years.

Police and Ms Flores's family dispute 
Van der Sloot's version of her death. They say the defendant was hard up
for cash and knew the Peruvian business student had been winning at the
casino.

'I want to give a sincere confession, but I don't agree with all the charges that has placed on me (sic) by the prosecutor. Can I have more time to think about this?'

Joran Van der Sloot

Peruvian criminal law specialists have
said prosecutors were initially expected to try for a sentence of life 
imprisonment against Van der Sloot.

But they had to scale back their plans
and are expected to ask for the 30-year term because of sentencing 
guidelines for murders in which robbery could be the primary motive.

If convicted and sentenced to 30 years in prison, Van der Sloot would be eligible for parole after serving 10 years.

Other case: Van der Sloot, was also arrested but never charged in the 2005 disappearance on the Dutch Caribbean island Aruba of 18-year-old Alabama native Natalee Holloway, pictured

Peruvian police said Ms Flores, the daughter of a circus promoter and former race car driver, was robbed and killed on May 30 in 2010, exactly five years after Ms Holloway disappeared.

The murder probe brought renewed 
attention to the case of Natalee Holloway, who vanished during a high school 
graduation trip to Aruba, where Van der Sloot was living.

He was arrested twice in the case but never charged due to a lack of evidence. Her family has criticised Dutch authorities for not making more 
progress in the case.

They met at the Atlantic Casino in Lima and CCTV videos show the two playing at the same table, then leaving, police said. They went to his hotel to play poker, he told authorities after the incident.

While they were playing, his computer received an instant message on his links to the Holloway case. Van Der Sloot said Ms Flores then struck him, and he became enraged and strangled her.

That same day, he was charged in Alabama with trying to extort the Holloway family in return for disclosing where Ms Holloway's body was.

Van Der Sloot fled to Chile but was arrested there and returned to Peru for questioning.
