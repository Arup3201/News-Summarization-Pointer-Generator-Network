Judy Murray has backed her son Andy to bounce back from his Wimbledon disappointment, insisting ‘form is temporary, class is permanent’.

Defending champion Murray was dumped out of the tournament in straight sets by Grigor Dimitrov on Wednesday, continuing a difficult year.

The British No 1 has not won an event or beaten a top-10 player in 2014 but his mother told BBC Radio yesterday that she is in no doubt he will recover soon.

‘I’m sure he’ll be back,’ said Judy, who was on Centre Court for the match. ‘Form is temporary, class is permanent.’

Murray shouted in frustration during the defeat, appearing to swear at someone in his player’s box, and complained about something that happened ‘five minutes before the f***ing match’.

But Judy said she was not aware of any falling-out or distractions.

She added: ‘I think every athlete can handle losing if they’ve played well or played their best and I think when you’re on such a big stage as this, and especially when you’re defending your title and it’s in front of your home crowd, it is so difficult to take that you haven’t managed to find close to your best form.’
