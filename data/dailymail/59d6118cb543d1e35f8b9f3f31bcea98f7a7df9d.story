A new species of mushroom that looks like a man has been discovered by the side of a road.

The fungus, found in Cockley Cley, Norfolk, has fleshy off-shoots that appear to resemble human heads, arms and legs.

The discovery was made by Jonathan Revett and the mushroom has now been classified as a new species in the world. 

Fun guys: A new species of mushroom that looks like a man has been discovered by the side of a busy road

They have been named as geastrum britannicum to reflect them being unique to the UK.

Mr Revett, 49, said: 'They do look like little mushroom men.

'It's really strange how their shape makes them look like they have a head and arms. That's what drew my attention to them.'

Despite first spotting them in 2000, the fungus was dismissed as a species of earthstar fungi which is prevalent in Norfolk.

Having been interested in mycology - the study of fungus - for more than 40 years, Mr Revett sent them off to Kew Gardens for testing.

However, 15 years later, mycologists in Spain carried out DNA sequence analysis and have just confirmed they differ slightly.

Mr Revett - who runs the mycology website fenfungi.com - said: 'It felt brilliant knowing I'd found something new.

'I wouldn't normally question the experts but I just knew these were different.

'I go back to the site every year doing tours and they're always there.

Since Mr Revett's original find, three more specimens have been collected in Norfolk and the fungus has also been found in Hampshire and the Welsh Borders

'It's incredible to think I'd only gone out there to look at some big mushrooms I'd been tipped off about.'

Since Mr Revett's original find, three more specimens have been collected in Norfolk and the fungus has also been found in Hampshire and the Welsh Borders.

Carl Chapman, of Norfolk-based Wildlife Tours and Education, said: 'This is riveting stuff. This is not just a new species for Norfolk - this is a new species for the world.

'They were doing the work and requested some samples of this fungus and found the DNA was different.'
