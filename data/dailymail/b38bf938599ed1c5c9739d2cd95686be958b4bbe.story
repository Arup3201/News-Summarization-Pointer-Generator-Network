Contrary to popular belief, bookmakers do get it wrong. The fluctuations of football manager  betting markets provide the proof.

In the last week Henrik Larsson, Owen Coyle and Malky Mackay have all been quoted as favourites for the Celtic job.

Larsson has since ruled himself out, Coyle is currently golfing in Tenerife and Mackay received some informal, indirect overtures via third parties last week, but has heard nothing since.

Still got it: Keane on the ball during an Ireland training session ahead of Saturday friendly with Italy in London

The turf accountants got there in the 
end. On Tuesday Roy Keane was quoted for the Celtic job at long odds of 
33/1. By Thursday he was even money.

Martin
 O’Neill confirmed something was afoot at a press conference in Dublin 
ahead of Ireland’s weekend friendly with Italy. Celtic say Keane has not
 been offered the job, that they are still speaking to a number of 
candidates.

That Keane is now the first choice of major shareholder 
Dermot Desmond,  however, seems clear enough. Keane, says his Republic 
of Ireland colleague, ‘has a lot to consider.’

‘The question Roy 
will be asking himself now is whether the Celtic job is a big enough 
challenge for him?’ said former Parkhead boss and MUTV analyst Lou 
Macari.

‘Where is the challenge? Celtic can’t do a great deal in Europe, can they? Success now is reaching the Champions League.

‘So it’s down to whether he wants it or not. If he does, then it’s a good job for him and a good appointment for Celtic.’

Amongst
 supporters that’s not a common view. Like Larsson, the 42-year-old 
would be a ‘marquee’ capture for Desmond. He is a big name. The kind of 
high-profile figure who, in the parlance of these things, might put 
‘bums on seats’. For a time at least.

In 2006, the deal to take the  
combative midfielder to Celtic for a final swansong after leaving Old 
Trafford was done at Desmond’s behest. The Irish billionaire was also 
instrumental in bringing together the Football Association of Ireland 
and the managerial dream team he could now be on the verge of 
dismantling.

A man who likes to hear an Irish accent or two around Parkhead Desmond would regard Keane as quite a catch.

Amongst supporters, however, there is less enthusiasm for Keane.

An
 icon at Manchester United, Keane has hardly been a roaring success in 
management. His appointment, some suspect, would be a commercial 
decision more than a logical footballing one.

It’s three years since 
Keane was last a front-line manager in  England, a miserable 21 month 
stint in charge of Ipswich Town ending in the sack.

‘What are Celtic
 fans worried about?’ asked an incredulous Macari. ‘Are they worried 
they are not going to win the Scottish league? Because they don’t have 
to worry about that. They’ll win that by 20 points whoever comes in.

‘I
 don’t see where the concern is. If this happens, then it’s a good 
appointment from Celtic’s point of view and it’s a good chance for Roy 
to make some progress again. Most of all in Europe.’

Many of the worries over Keane concern his man management skills. Or perceived lack of.

Old Bhoy: Keane played half a season with Celtic after leaving Manchester United in the 2005-2006 campaign

A
 loathing for the hair gel and Bentley generation of modern football 
players brokered a series  of bust-ups, rows and broken  relationships 
at Sunderland and Ipswich.

He took the Wearsiders up in his first 
season in charge. Writing in his autobiography, however, Dwight Yorke 
accused his former Old  Trafford team-mate of ruling the Stadium of 
Light by fear.

One tale concerning the  destruction of a tactics 
board is now infamous. ‘The board goes up,’ recalled Yorke. ‘And Keano 
takes a running jump and smashes it over with a kung-fu kick.

‘And 
then the captain (Dean  Whitehead) is next. “Captain?  Captain? Some 
f****** captain you are”, he rages, slapping Dean about the head in the 
process before  turning on us all. “I can’t trust any of you”.’

One 
of the players who proved a constant source of frustration was Anthony 
Stokes, now at Celtic. The two have since reunited on  international 
duty, but you would pay a penny or two for the striker’s thoughts this 
morning.

When Keane quit Sunderland, Yorke sent him a text message 
wishing him future success. Keane was short and succinct in reply. ‘Go 
f*** yourself’ was the response.

Matters barely improved at  Ipswich.
 Fellow Cork man Damien Delaney told of Portman Road  players feeling a 
surge of relief when Keane was sacked in January 2011.

Questions over
 his interpersonal and diplomatic skills have been a pattern of his 
management career. And despite a brief six-month spell  at Parkhead as a
 player and close links with Desmond and Martin O’Neill, there is 
nothing on his recent CV which screams ‘Celtic manager’. Whilst a 
Parkhead player, Keane kept his family in England and seemed almost 
semi-detached from his surroundings. Quizzed on a return last week he 
was effusive, but non-committal.

‘They are a brilliant club, an  
absolutely fantastic football club, one of the best in the world. But I 
have got a job,’ he said.

In truth, he has two.

In the frame: Malky Mackay has also been considered as Celtic seek a replacement for Neil Lennon

Shortlist: Owen Coyle, last in employment at Wigan, was also considered by Celtic

A cutting, incisive analyst on ITV, Keane surprised everybody last November when he agreed to become O’Neill’s assistant.

The
 FAI later thanked Dermot Desmond for the role he played in making their
 managerial dream team a reality. They may soon have cause to curse him 
for taking Keane away. That Desmond’s close  business acquaintance and 
Celtic shareholder Denis O’Brien is  effectively funding his wages 
limits their ability to resist, however.

Should he accept, Keane 
would be expected to work with the current Celtic transfer model of 
buying young and selling big. He would have a direct line to Desmond, 
but would be expected to work with the chief executive Peter Lawwell and
 scouting chief John Park, currently considering his own offer from  
Norwich City. The dynamics of those relationships would be a source of 
intrigue.

In Dublin there is speculation Keane could be asked to stay
 on as Ireland’s number two, dovetailing the role with managing Celtic. 
Whether that’s possible when  Ireland are in the same European 
Championship qualifying group as Scotland is debatable.

The decision 
will be helped by the advice of an old sage. ‘I’d be  disappointed if he
 was to go,’ said O’Neill. ‘But a club like Celtic is a very big club 
and those offers don’t come around too often.’

O’Neill once spent 
weeks  agonising over a move to Parkhead following a Desmond overture. 
He admitted as much yesterday and said: ‘Ah listen, for me that’s what I
 wanted to do in 2000 when Celtic came for me. I loved Leicester City, 
it was great. Celtic came along and it was what I wanted to do.’

No one, you suspect, recognises the dilemma facing Roy Keane this morning more than he does.
