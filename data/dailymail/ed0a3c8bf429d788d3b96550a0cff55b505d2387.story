House prices soared by 11.7 per cent over the past year to hit a new record high of £272,000, official figures revealed this morning.

In the 12 months to July the cost of buying a home jumped in every region – but prices in London continued to pull away from the rest of the country. Property in the capital boomed by 19.1 per cent and by 12.1 per cent in the wider South East. 

With house prices running far ahead of inflation  and pay it is becoming increasingly difficult for first-time buyers to get on the ladder. 

In July, prices paid by first-time buyers were 13.5 per cent higher on average than in July 2013. The average price paid for a first home in July  was £209,000.

Soaring house prices are pushing more and more people into paying stamp duty.

With the average price of a home now £272,000, thousands of ordinary families are being forced to pay 3 per cent in tax - or £8,100.

Stamp duty starts at 1 per cent for homes over £125,000, before jumping to 3 per cent on properties worth more than £250,000. 

Families in London can now expect to pay 4 per cent stamp duty because the average price of a property in the capital is now more than £500,000.

The duty is levied at 5 per cent on homes worth more than £1million and 7 per cent for those worth over £2million.

House prices across England - excluding London and the South East - grew by  7.9 per cent to hit an average of £206,000.

This is just ahead of Wales, where prices increased by 7.4 per cent and Scotland which saw 7.6 per cent growth. House prices in Northern Ireland meanwhile increased by just 4.5 per cent.

The average house price across the UK in July was £272,000. In England the average home is £284,000, £171,000 in Wales, £139,000 in Northern Ireland and £198,000 in Scotland.

Prices in London were the highest in the country – at £514,000. The North East had the lowest average house price at £156,000. 

Several UK regions saw property prices reach fresh all-time highs in the month of July, with the East Midlands, the West Midlands and the South West now joining London, the East and the South East in having price levels higher than their pre-financial crisis peaks of 2007/08, the Office for National Statistics said.

Average house prices in Scotland have now passed their pre-financial crisis peak of June 2008 and, alongside England, property values there are now at record levels, the ONS said.

House prices in England are now 13 per cent above their previous high, while those in Scotland have climbed to 0.7 per cent above previous peak levels.

Wales is not far behind Scotland, with prices there just 0.8 per cent below their 2008 peak.

Northern Ireland remains the area with the furthest climb to recover to previous peak levels, with prices there 46.7 per cent below their peak.

People are increasingly turning to mortgages lasting more than 30 years as house prices continue to soar 

Figures released by the Council of Mortgage Lenders last week showed that the number of mortgages handed out to first-time buyers passed 30,000 in July, marking the first time this has happened during a one-month period since August 2007.

But first-time buyers are typically having to borrow record amounts to get on the property ladder, with the average size of a new loan taken out by this sector standing at £127,500 in July, according to the CML’s figures.

The current low interest rate environment is helping to keep borrowing costs down, but home owners have been warned to start thinking now about how they will cope with the prospect of higher payments when the Bank of England base rate eventually starts to move off its historic 0.5 per cent low.
