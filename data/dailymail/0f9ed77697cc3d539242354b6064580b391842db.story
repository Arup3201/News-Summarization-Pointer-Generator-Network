A soldier returning home Afghanistan surprised his family dressed as a polar bear mascot at a local football game.

US Army Specialist Justin May, disguised as the Bracken County High mascot polar bear, caught his father Ronald and brother Ryan unawares when he removed the costume head on the field.

The American soldier had just returned home from an 11-month deployment, including nine months in the Middle East, when he decided to make a grand entrance last Friday night.

Surprise, surprise: US Army Specialist Justin May embraces his father Ronald (right) and brother Ryan (left) after he surprised them at a local football game disguised as the team's mascot, a polar bear

Father Ronald, who is an assistant coach for the football team from Brooksville, Kentucky, embraced his son after he revealed himself.

According to Fox 29 Philadelphia, father Mr May said: ‘It was crazy, I mean, just proud of him, glad to see he's home safe.’

After
the coin toss the announcer congratulated the soldier on his service in
Afghanistan just as he removed the costume head as his father and 
brother, a member of the football team, ran over to embrace him on the 
midfield.

Focused on the game: Ryan (second player from the left) thought his brother would not be home until next month

Ryan told The Ledger Independent: ‘He said he wouldn’t be in until my birthday next month. 

‘I wondered why all the news people were here tonight.’

Before his time in Afghanistan, Spec May had spent two months training in Texas.

The plan to surprise his loved ones was hatched by his mother Maria May and even the coach Mike Sizemore was in on the plan.

The hot faux fur costume was not enough to deter the cheeky soldier.

Loving embrace: Spec May and his father have an emotional reunion, embracing for the first time in almost a year away from home

Almost gave it away: Spec May almost ruined the surprise when he recently posted on Facebook that he was glad to be finished his service in Afghanistan

He said: ‘It is like being-in-the-dessert hot in here.’

Spec May almost gave his secret away when he posted on Facebook that he was ‘glad to be out of [Afghanistan],’ his mother said. 

Last year, three young boys couldn't hug their Army father fast enough when he surprised them during a football game’s halftime after being deployed to Afghanistan for more than seven months.

The Houston, Texas stadium was filled with cheers and tears when mascot Toro the bull lifted a wrapped cardboard box on the field to reveal Chief Warrant Officer Eric Spoerle, entirely to the surprise of his three sons.

Having been pulled to the sidelines after an essay contest, brothers Tristan and Brandon, along with their 2-year-old brother Eric Jr., were first distracted by cheerleaders rewarding them with jerseys and hats.
