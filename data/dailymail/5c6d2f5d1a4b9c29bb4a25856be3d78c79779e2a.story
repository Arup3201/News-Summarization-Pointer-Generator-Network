The Muslim Brotherhood today claimed to be in pole position in Egypt's parliamentary election with as much as 40 per cent of the vote.

The initial count of votes from the opening stage of what is Egypt's first free election since army officers drove the king into exile in 1952 have started to come in.

A member of the rival liberal Egyptian Bloc said that in Cairo the Brotherhood's Freedom and Justice Party (FJP) had 40 to 50 per cent of votes while his party had 20 to 30 per cent.

Complex: The overall outcome will not be known until January as the election is spread over six weeks with different regions voting separately in three phases, each of which may be followed by run-off votes

As the results started to come in last night, about 80 people were injured in the city's Tahrir Square when clashes broke out between protesters and street vendors after polls closed.

The
 protesters, who have camped out in the square for more than 10 days 
demanding Egypt's military rulers step down, tried to clear the area of 
street vendors, who brought in thugs and hurled stones and fireballs 
back.

Partial official results are due later today but party representatives have been monitoring the count as it proceeds.

The overall outcome will not be known until January. The election is spread over six weeks with different parts of the country voting separately in three phases, each of which may be followed by run-off votes.

Under an elaborate system that makes it difficult to predict the outcome, two-thirds of the 498 elected seats go to party lists and the rest to individuals.

Morocco's king has chosen the head of an Islamist party that won the most votes in Friday's elections as the next prime minister.

King Mohammed VI received Abdelilah Benkirane, the secretary general of the Justice and Development Party, in the mountain town of Midelt yesterday and named him prime minister.

Under the country's new constitution, the king must choose a prime minister from the party that won the most votes in the election.

The Islamist party took 107 seats out of the 395 in Parliament in Friday's election - almost twice as many as the second-place finisher.

It must now assemble a governing coalition. Several parties have already expressed their interest in an alliance.

The FJP said in a statement that early indications showed it in the lead for both party-list and individual mandate seats.

It said the ultra-conservative Islamist al-Nour party was next, followed by the liberal Egyptian Bloc.

An
 FJP source, who declined to be named, said it had secured 40 per cent 
of votes cast for party lists across the nine governorates where voting 
was held in this week's first round.

The FJP statement said the party's strongest showing so far was in Fayoum, south of Cairo, followed by the Red Sea, Cairo and the southern city of Assiut. It said the rival Nour party was a strong competitor in Kafr el-Sheikh and Alexandria.

Other areas that voted in the first round include Luxor, Port Said and Damietta.

Basil Adel, whose party is part of the Egyptian Bloc, which includes liberal and other parties, said the bloc's list had secured 20 to 30 per cent of votes counted so far in Cairo.

Mr Adel, who is a member of the Free 
Egyptians party co-founded by Christian telecoms tycoon Naguib Sawiris, 
said the Brotherhood's list had secured 40 to 50 per cent of the vote in
 Cairo, while Nour had 5 to 7 per cent.

A
 source at another liberal party also said the FJP was ahead in the 
lists, but did not give numbers, while an official from another liberal 
group, the Justice Party, questioned the Brotherhood's claim to early 
success.

Election officials 
said results would be given later today for contests for individual 
seats, determining which candidates secured an outright win of more than
 50 per cent of the vote and which would need to go to run-off votes 
next week.

Results for party lists will not be announced until after the final round of voting finishes on January 11.
