Headline News has canceled Jane Velez-Mitchell's show and laid off her staff in the midst of an eight per cent staff cut across CNN.

Velez-Mitchell's program had been on for six years on HLN, a sister network to CNN, before ending Monday.

She was told of the termination on Tuesday, according to a CNN executive, who said that the cut will affect her and 11 other staff members.

CNN Worldwide is working its way through an 8 per cent staff cut that will affect a total of 300 jobs.

So far, about 130 people are estimated to have taken buyout packages, with the rest covered by layoffs, the executive said Wednesday. 

Talks this summer between Vice Media and Time Warner had given hope to HLN that it would be taken off CNN's plate and its programs added to Vice.

The digital media company came 'very close' to a deal with Time Warner to sell a 45 percent stake in the company according to Buzzfeed.

The deal would have included Time Warner bundling the HLN network into another Vice-directed endeavor and injecting it with cash.

After the deal fell through, Vice sold off about 10 percent of its estimated value to A&E, reports the New York Times. 

Layoffs: In addition to her own program, Velez-Mitchell had filled in for other Headline News anchors like Nancy Grace

Velez-Mitchell's show, which was formerly called Issues with Jane Velez-Mitchell, debuted on Headline News in 2008 and replaced Glenn Beck's slot after he left for Fox News. 

She had been one of the few openly gay journalists on television, writing in her autobiography that she came out on a late-night radio show run by Al Rantel in 2007.
