The orphaned daughter of Kansas City Chief Jovan Belcher will receive more than $1 million from the NFL.

Belcher shot Kasandra Perkins his 22-year-old girlfriend and the mother of his child before driving to Arrowhead stadium and turning the gun on himself.

The murder-suicide on Saturday morning means that the estate or guardian of his three-month-old daughter Zoey will receive the money under NFL's collective-bargaining agreement.

Happy family: Belcher killed his girlfriend before shooting himself at the Kansas City Chiefs' stadium. His daughter stands to receive $1million from NFL

Zoey stands to receive $108,000 annually over the next four years, $48,000 in the fifth year and then $52,000 each year until age 18.

She'll continue to receive that amount until age 23 if she attends college.

The beneficiary of Belcher, who was in his fourth season, also will receive $600,000 in life insurance, plus $200,000 for each credited season.

Moving on: Retired Chiefs Hall of Famer Bobby Bell said, 'It's done and over with and people need to get on with their lives.'

There is also $100,000 in a retirement account that will go to his beneficiary or estate.

Players' beneficiaries are kept confidential - the current collective bargaining agreement was ratified in August 2011.

Belcher's mother Cheryl Shepherd, 54, has temporary custody of the couple's baby and relatives have said she will take responsibility for the infant.

Gone: Belcher's baby will never know her mother

It is thought she will raise her granddaughter at the Long Island home where the 25-year-old grew up.

Ms Shepherd had been in Kansas City to help Belcher and his girlfriend with their young daughter when the incident happened.

The
couple had doted on their young daughter - they posted several photos 
on the internet showing Perkins holding the infant when she was born as 
well as photos of the trio.

Meanwhile more details have been released about the hours leading up to the tragedy.

Belcher was awoken by police officers at 2.50am as he slept outside an apartment block in his car.

He told them that he was there to visit his 'girlfriend', yet she was not home, police spokesman Darin Snapp said.

Snapp said Belcher made a phone call and a short time later, a woman let Belcher into her building.

While
Snapp said police did not question the woman and don't know who she is,
the New York Post identified her as Brittni Glass, who works at an 
Armani Exchange in Kansas City,

Witnesses have since told police that Belcher stayed at the apartment until 6:30 a.m., Snapp said.

Murder: After leaving, he went home, shot his live-in girlfriend and then killed himself at his team's stadium

'I was with him that night, that's it,' Glass told the Post.

Glass said they had been together 
that night but were not in a relationship and would not say where he 
slept. Police confirmed that several people came forward to tell them 
about Belcher's visit.

Snapp
added: 'When he was sleeping she may have come home, and he didn't 
realise. He was very cooperative and thanked the officers.'

He went off their radar until about 7:50 a.m., when police were called to Belcher's home after he had shot and killed Perkins.

Stepping out: Brittni Glass, who was out with Jovan Belcher the night before he killed his girlfriend before committing suicidie, is seen in Kansas City on Tuesday morning

'Girlfriend': He was reportedly found sleeping in his car outside her home before going inside for four hours

Her body was found on the floor of the master bathroom with multiple gunshot wounds, according to a police incident report.

Belcher's mother said she was not happy about the release Wednesday of recordings of the emergency phone call she made after Perkins was shot.

'I just got a phone call that they did that, and I don't appreciate it'  she said.

'Right now I don't want to talk about it.'

In the  911 calls released by Kansas City police,  Shepherd begs Perkins to stay alive.

'Stay with me, the ambulance is on the way. Stay with me,' she shouts.

She adds to the dispatcher: 'She's still breathing but please hurry. I don't know how he... They were arguing, please hurry.'

Final night: Crews work on an apartment building in Kansas City, Missouri where Jovan Belcher spent some of his final hours outside the home of a woman whom he called his 'girlfriend'

Away from home: Police said Belcher went inside around 2.30am and witnesses said he left at 6.30am

Shepherd told dispatchers that Perkins was bleeding, 'just barely' awake and that it looked as though she was wounded in the back. She said Perkins moved when she spoke to her.

When police arrived at the couple's home at about 7:50 a.m., they found Perkins' body on the floor of the master bathroom with gunshot wounds to her chest, neck and abdomen.

By this point Belcher had driven to his team’s stadium and shot himself dead in front of his coach and general manager.

Crime scene: The Independence, Missouri, home where Belcher fatally shot his girlfriend on Saturday

On Wednesday, Shepherd said that the days since the shooting have been very difficult - but that she loves her son and the slain girlfriend.

In a brief phone conversation, Shepherd, who had been staying with the couple to help out with the baby, said she had a 'beautiful relationship' with Perkins.

She added that she has been working on funeral arrangements for Belcher but has not managed to sleep or eat much since the slayings.

Mourners, including several Chiefs players, attended an hour-long private memorial service for Belcher on Wednesday in Kansas City.

Retired Chiefs Hall of Famer Bobby Bell said afterward:  'This is a sad situation,'

'You never want to be put under those situations. Never. It's not good. You don't want to see things like that. I don't know how they got through it.'

The funeral for Perkins is scheduled for this afternoon at the Ridgeview Family Fellowship Church in Blue Ridge, Texas, 50 miles northeast of Dallas

According to the Turrentine Jackson Morrow funeral home, she is also survived by two siblings, her parents, grandparents and a great-grandmother.
