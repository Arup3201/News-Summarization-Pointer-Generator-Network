Apprentice star and businessmen Lord Sugar today accused the French authorities in Calais of encouraging illegal immigrants to smuggle themselves into Britain

Apprentice star and businessman Lord Sugar has accused the French authorities in Calais of encouraging illegal immigrants to smuggle themselves into Britain.

The Labour peer said that too often the French take the view that 'it is not our problem' and suggested they wanted to 'get rid' of the thousands of migrants camped out at the port as quickly as possible.

Lord Sugar called for more British border police to be based in France, but ministers urged lorry drivers to 'padlock' their vehicles and told holidaymakers to do the same to avoid migrants sneaking on board.

Growing numbers of migrants have been trying to enter the UK through Calais in recent months.

Bernard Cazeneuve, the French interior minister, called for Britain send more support to Calais to deal with the port's 'tremendous problem' with illegal immigration.

And the mayor of Calais Natacha Bouchart told MPs last month that Britain was seen as an 'El Dorado' for migrants – and many were prepared to die to make the journey.

Blaming the UK for the crisis, Miss Bouchart said lavish benefits and the prospect of illegal work and accommodation were magnets for immigrants determined to get across the English Channel.

But in the House of Lords today, peers questioned whether the French were doing enough to tackle the problem on their shores.

Lord Sugar, who has had business dealings in France, questioned 'the manner in which the French police and other authorities are carrying out their job'.

He asked Home Office minister Lord Bates if he thinks the French 'are really interested in the problem'.

Lord Sugar added: 'My experience of dealing with the French in the commercial world, with the greatest respect, is that they think, 'It is not our problem'.

'One wonders whether they want to get rid of these people as quickly as possible. Is there a case for putting some of our people there to invigilate?'

Under an agreement between London and Paris, UK Border Force staff are based in France to try to catch people before they leave instead of monitoring arrivals in the UK.

Lord Bates said: 'We have Border Force people on the ground augmenting the work done by the port-side authorities'

'In addition, we have sniffer dogs on the port side, as well as the fencing which we are introducing. That co-operation is there; we should like it to be extended.'

There are up to 2,500 illegal immigrants camped in the French port trying to reach UK, with many clambering into lorries to cross the Channel

Earlier this month MailOnline revealed Britain has just five scanners to detect stowaways trying to enter the country in lorries through our 29 ports.

The UK Border Force budget also fell by 20 per cent last year, raising fears about the ability to detect attempts by foreigners to smuggle themselves across the Channel in cars, trucks and trailers.

Ministers were forced to admit that despite there being 51 points of entry into the UK at 29 ports for foreign vehicles, there are just five scanners in operation in France checking vehicles before they leave for Britain.

Lord Bates said the problem was only likely to get worse and warned both lorry and car drivers to be on their guard.

Former commissioner of the Metropolitan police Lord Condon questioned what the 'major impediment' was to coming up with a solution to the problem.

Lord Bates told him: 'The very simple tasks of actually securing the vehicle and ensuring that it is padlocked - if that happened the problem would be reduced dramatically from what it is.'

Shadow Home Office minister Baroness Smith of Basildon said: 'Desperate migrants will get access to any vehicle in order to try and seek a better life.

'Many travellers to France in their cars for a weekend or to do their shopping are being advised in Calais not to leave their cars empty even to enter a shop or to have lunch.'

She asked: 'What advice are you giving to domestic travellers to Calais and do you think we have enough border staff given the cuts that they have taken from the Government?'

Lord Bates said the Border Agency had been reformed to provide 'the toughest regime in the world'.

'The reality is that in terms of domestic tourists and other travellers there they should really be aware that this is a major problem - it is only to get worse and they have to take the same level of security to protect their vehicles as well,' he said.

Tory former Cabinet minister Lord Tebbit asked: 'Why do these people arrive here? Surely they have been in France? Are they fleeing from persecution in France?

'What's wrong with the French state that it doesn't accept its obligations to look after such people?'

Lord Bates said a fall in unemployment and growth in the economy in the UK, which was the 'opposite' to France, was acting as a 'pull factor into this country'.
