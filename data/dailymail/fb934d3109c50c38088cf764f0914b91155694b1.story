England succumbed to a painful 24-21 defeat against New Zealand at Twickenham on Saturday - their fifth in succession against the All Blacks.

Stuart Lancaster's men went ahead early on when Jonny May scored a wonderful try to get his first Test score before New Zealand fought back. Aaron Cruden, Richie McCaw and Charlie Faumuina all crossed the whitewash for the All Blacks to put the game beyond England, with the hosts' late penalty try not being enough to claim victory.

Here, Sportsmail looks at five positive things England learned from the match.

1) May CAN score tries at Test level

Question marks have been raised about the Gloucester winger's ability to score on the international stage but he answered those with aplomb just four minutes into the encounter at Twickenham.

The 24-year-old received the ball 30 yards from the tryline but he completely burned Israel Dagg for pace on the outside before brilliantly finishing in the corner.

No-one has ever doubted his pace and ability but there had been concerns about whether or not he had the mental capacity to be a Test finisher.

Saturday's try will have given May plenty of confidence and ensures the tricky runner will be given more time to develop into an international-standard wing.

2) England's semi-reserve side can push the All Blacks all the way

Lancaster's side had been ravaged by injuries this autumn and it was a semi-reserve XV who took to the field at HQ on Saturday.

Despite that, England came extremely close to beating the All Blacks and were certainly the better side in the first half.

Once George Kruis replaced the injured Courtney Lawes, England had their fifth and sixth-choice second rows from last season on the pitch - and neither looked out of place. Dave Attwood was magnificent and Kruis also showed he has a lot to offer this side.

With the likes of Joe Lauchbury, Manu Tuilagi, Marland Yarde, Alex Corbisiero, Tom Croft, Mako Vunipola, Dan Cole and Tom Youngs to return - not to mention the possible integration of rugby league convert Sam Burgess in the future - then England have an extremely competitive squad which runs deep with talent.

You need a squad to win a World Cup, and England most certainly have more than 30 players worthy of being in the side next year.

3) Chris Robshaw again proved he is certainly worth his place in the side

He has so many critics but the England captain was magnificent in defeat once more.

The Harlequins flanker got through an astonishing amount of work and was certainly not out-shone by opposite number McCaw.

Yes, Robshaw is not your archetypal 'openside' but he does a tremendous and tireless job for England at No 7.

With Tom Wood doing the dirty work and Billy Vunipola the bulk of the carrying, England's back three complement each other extremely well and should retain their places against South Africa next week.

4) Lancaster's men need to be more clinical when they are on top

What will frustrate Lancaster and his coaches - as well as the players - more than anything else was that England did not take their opportunities when they were presented with them.

England were tremendous in the first half, particularly in the opening 20 minutes, but they only came away with one try to show for it.

New Zealand did not make that mistake and, most notably, Robshaw and his troops can look to their opponent's third try as something to learn from.

The All Blacks worked through 22 phases before replacement prop Faumuina bundled over the line. That is the art of clinical finishing - keep the ball alive and make sure you take your chances.

This is something England need to rectify during the Six Nations to build confidence leading up to the World Cup. 

New Zealand were clinical, like for Charlie Faumuina's (centre) try, and England must learn from this

5) The Red Rose's scrum can be a potent weapon going forward 

In the last 10 minutes England utterly destroyed New Zealand at the set piece.

The replacement front row of Rob Webber, Matt Mullan and young Newcastle Falcons prop Kieran Brookes - who was playing on the opposite side to where he has been deployed all season - bullied the All Blacks in the scrum.

A penalty try eventually ensued, albeit too late for England to win the match, such was their dominance in this area.

With so many front rowers missing through injury, including the destructive Corbisiero, Lancaster and scrummaging coach Graham Rowntree can continue to hone England's scrum and ensure it will be a useful weapon next autumn.
