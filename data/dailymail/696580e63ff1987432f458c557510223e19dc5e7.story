The owner of the luxury property, which was drawn in a lottery on Christmas Eve, is known to staff at the RSL but has been uncontactable since the windfall.

'We have his contact phone number, address and email but every attempt through those channels has been silent,'  said RSL Art Union Lotteries general manaher, Luke Traini.

'The registered letters have not been collected, the home and mobile phones unanswered,' he told The Sydney Morning Herald. 

The owner lives in the Sydney suburb of Bonnyrigg, and may have already forfeited a potential $20,000 in rent from the property.  

Mr Traini said the Union may have to take the step of hiring a private investigator in order to locate the winner.

The property is located in Currumbin on the Gold Coast in Queensland

The luxury property could have already generated $20,000 rent over the past six weeks

The owner lives in the Sydney suburb of Bonnyrigg, which has a population of 8000

'This is the first time the RSL have been unable to get in touch with the lucky winner of one of its homes,' he said.

Already the winner, who lives in the Sydney suburb of Bonnyrigg, has missed out on a potential $20,000 in rent .

Bonnyrigg has approximately 8000 residents, one of whom is unaware of the windfall.
