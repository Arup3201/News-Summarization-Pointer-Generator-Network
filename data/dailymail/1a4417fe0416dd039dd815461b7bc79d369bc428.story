The president of PayPal has had his credit card details skimmed and used for an illegal shopping spree.

David Marcus believes his credit card, which had the more secure EMV chip technology, was skimmed during a recent trip to the UK.

The business executive added that the fraud would never have happened if he had been able to use his PayPal account in the shops and hotel he visited.

Fraud victim: PayPal president David Marcus had his credit card details stolen and used for a shopping spree

Mr Marcus said that because PayPal doesn't share card or bank account details with merchants, unlike credit cards, it is a safer way to pay.

The traditional magnetic strip on the back of cards contains all the information a would-be thief needs to steal data, and even EMV chip cards can be hacked into.

On Monday, Mr Marcus tweeted about the fraudulent activity on his account, saying: 'My card (with EMV chip) got skimmed while in the UK. Ton of fraudulent txns. Wouldn't have happened if merchant accepted PayPal...'

'They then cloned it and went on a shopping spree,' he added.

Although his card had an EMV chip - an embedded microchip that uses a PIN to verify transactions - it also had the traditional magnetic strip.

'Basically, the magnetic strip contains all the data needed for credit card fraud,' Lamar Bailey, director of security research for Tripwire, told Forbes.

'Unfortunately, these strips are very easy to read and duplicate and are a favorite target for a wide variety of financial fraud,' he said.

Data thieves use skimmers, a device fitted to the front of an ATM or terminal, which lifts information from swiped cards.

The technology has been around for years, but thieves are constantly improving it, cyber security expert Brian Krebs told USA Today.

PayPal takes customer security further by never handing over their financial information.

The company has been tried to expand from its online presence, and encourage stores and restaurants to accept PayPal as a method of payment.

'Obfuscating card data online, on 
mobile, and now more and more offline remains one of PayPal's strongest 
value props,' Mr Marcus tweeted, after announcing he had been a victim of fraud.
