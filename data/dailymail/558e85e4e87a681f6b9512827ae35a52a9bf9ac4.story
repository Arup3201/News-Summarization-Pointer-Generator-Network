ITV’S sporting shake-up continued with Jacqui Oatley brought in as a major player in their football coverage next season.

Oatley, who was the first female commentator on BBC’s Match of the Day in 2007, has stepped across to take a major position within ITV 4, where she will anchor football programmes during the 2015-16 season.

The highly respected broadcaster will also present ITV’s darts coverage, starting with the PDC European Championship in Belgium at the end of October.

The move continues ITV’s major shake-up, which has so far seen Adrian Chiles’ axed earlier this year and replaced by BBC Radio 5Live’s Mark Pougatch.

Chiles had led ITV’s Champions League and England coverage, as well as last summer’s World Cup in Brazil. Long-standing pundit Andy Townsend has also been told his contract will not be renewed when it expires in the summer, along with Matt Smith, whose position as the broadcaster’s secondary football reporter has been taken by Oatley.

Niall Sloane, ITV Director of Sport, said yesterday: ‘Jacqui’s outstanding knowledge and experience make her a first class addition to the ITV Sport team. We look forward to welcoming her on board in September.’

Oatley, who has previously presented football programmes on ITV, including the FA Cup and Africa Cup of Nations, added: ‘I'm delighted to have been asked to join the ITV team from next season.

‘I've had a fantastic time working with them over the last couple of years and look forward to continuing that relationship at major tournaments.’

Oatley added that her new role will not see her cut ties with the BBC, where she has also fronted the Football League Show and covered snooker, golf, motor racing and the Olympic Games.

Oatley tweeted: ‘I’m not leaving the Beeb as such. Still hosting the WWC [women’s World Cup] coverage in summer and match reporting, etc next season. Love covering live games.’

Having lost live Champions League and Europa League football from next season, ITV’s only live football beyond outside major tournaments will be England’s international fixtures and other European qualifiers. However, they will show highlights of both UEFA club competitions next seasons.
