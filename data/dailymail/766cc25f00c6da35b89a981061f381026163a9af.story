Roman Catholic leaders yesterday joined the Church of England in criticising a law that would allow babies with three parents to be born - citing concerns about ethics and the safety of the procedure.

The move means the two biggest and most influential churches are now putting pressure on MPs to vote against allowing the controversial ‘mitochondrial donation’ technique to be legalised.

The Commons votes on Tuesday on Government amendments to embryo law, which would allow the technique in the cause of preventing devastating diseases in children and giving mothers with mitochondrial diseases the chance of a healthy child.

The technique involves swapping a mother’s diseased mitochondria – tiny parts of a cell which give energy to the cells in healthy bodies – for new mitochondria taken from an egg donated by another woman.

A vote in favour would mean Britain would become the first country in the world to permit the creation of test tube children who would effectively have two mothers and a father – three parents. 

The Church of England said earlier this week that there had been too little study of the technique and its implications and it was too soon to change the law.

Roman Catholic Bishop John Sherrington said yesterday on behalf of the church: ‘Many people are rightly concerned about the profound implications of Parliament passing regulations under the Human Fertilisation and Embryology Act to licence the creation of human embryos using the DNA of three people.

‘These are regulations for the transfer of “nuclear DNA” into an egg or an embryo to modify its genetic identity.

‘No other country has allowed this procedure and the international scientific community is not convinced that the procedure is safe and effective. It seems extraordinary that a licence should be sought for a radical new technique affecting future generations without first conducting a clinical trial.’

Bishop Sherrington added: ‘There are also serious ethical objections to this procedure which involves the destruction of human embryos as part of the process. The human embryo is a new human life, and it should be respected and protected from the moment of conception.

‘This is a very serious step which Parliament should not rush into taking.’

Women who have damaged mitochondria can miscarry repeatedly and often have to take a decision on whether they should abandon any ambition to have a family and instead choose to remain childless.

Those backing the law change include five Nobel prize winners, who said the decision should be put in the hands of parents.

In a letter to The Times, they said: ‘We believe those who know what it is like to care for, and sometimes to lose, an extremely sick child are the best-placed to decide whether this technology is right for them.’

But a recent safety report by the fertility watchdog, the Human Fertilisation & Embryology Authority said that babies with three parents should not be created in British labs until further searching tests have been carried out. In America, a government inquiry into the technique is continuing.

If the Commons and Lords vote in favour of the amendments next week, creating children by mitochondrial donation will be lawful in October.
