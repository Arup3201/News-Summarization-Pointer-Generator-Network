Japan have named former PSG manager Vahid Halilhodzic as their new national team boss.

The Japanese Football Association have been without a manager since they parted ways with Mexican coach Javier Aguirre, who was dismissed amid concerns of his alleged involvement in an ongoing match-fixing scandal that would interfere with their 2018 World Cup qualification.

Halilhodzic's appointment was formally approved at an executive board meeting on Thursday and reports in Japan suggest he will be handed an annual salary of £1.5million.
