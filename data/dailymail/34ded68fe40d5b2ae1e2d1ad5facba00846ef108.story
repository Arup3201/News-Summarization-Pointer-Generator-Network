New amateur video shows the  Kouachi brothers engaging in a dramatic shoot-off with French police on the streets of Paris - just moments after they massacred six Charlie Hebdo journalists.

Said and Cherif Kouachi can be seen getting out of the stolen vehicle and using its doors for cover, as they fire expertly at the police car.

The police officers swiftly reverse back down the narrow Parisien street to escape the relentless attack.

Filmed from an upstairs window, the footage begins with the Kouachi's chanting 'we have avenged the Prophet Muhammad' after their brutal attack on the satirical magazine's office.

The two masked men, who had just killed six Charlie Hebdo journalists, then place their automatic weapons on the roof of the car and calmly reload them before the terrifying confrontation.

The video shows their getaway halted by an oncoming police car - its sirens blazing - which forces one of the brothers to lean out of the window and begin shooting.

His accomplice then stops the car and joins the assault on the retreating vehicle.

Once the police car has reversed back to the end of the street, they restart their failed getaway and continue shooting out of the window until they have safely turned the corner.

According to the Telegraph, the man filming the dramatic gun battle is heard saying: 'These are false bullets.'

'No, they're not false bullets. They're ricocheting. Look at the cops. Look, look, they're reversing. They've smashed the cars.'

A massive manhunt involving tens of thousands of officers was launched but the Kouachis eluded police for the rest of the day - before eventually hiding out a print works in Dammartin-en-Goele, a small town just north of Paris.

After taking a hostage, the two men were finally killed by French special forces in a raid on January 9.
