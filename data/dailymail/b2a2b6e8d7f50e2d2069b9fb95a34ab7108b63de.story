The Vatican has given its blessing to exorcisms as a standard practise in the Catholic Church.

More than forty years after 1973 film The Exorcist terrified cinema audiences the world over, the Church has recognised, under canon law, the work of a group of priests who claim to banish demons from the possessed.

The International Association of Exorcists consists of 250 priests in 30 countries who perform religious ceremonies to 'liberate the faithful from demons.'

Pope Francis has emphasised that Satan exists and was previously thought to support exorcisms.

Last year he appeared to cast out a demon from a wheelchair bound man who said he was possessed by the devil.

The Vatican insisted the pope 'didn't intend to perform any exorcism,' and it released a statement that said 'he simply intended to pray for someone who was suffering who was presented to him.'

The man later said that Francis had failed to banish the demons from his body. However, after Francis placed his hands on him, he was able to walk again, he claimed.

 Fr. Francesco Bamonte, an exorcist from the Diocese of Rome told official Vatican newspaper L’Osservatore Romano that the Holy See’s approval of the IAE 'is cause for joy…for the church as a whole.'

'Exorcism is' in fact 'another form of charity' he said.
