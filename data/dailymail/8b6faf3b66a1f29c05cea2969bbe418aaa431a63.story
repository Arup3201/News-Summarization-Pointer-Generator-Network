Uber Technologies has confirmed it has taken 'disciplinary action' against one of its general managers who was being investigating for violating the popular car-booking service's privacy policies by snooping on a reporter's ride.

Josh Mohrer, general manager of Uber's New York office, was accused of using a company tracking tool called 'God View' to monitor the location of a BuzzFeed reporter earlier this month. 

In a statement, Uber said access to the personal data of anyone using its car service is limited to 'legitimate business purposes.' 

The San Francisco company said employees violating the rules may be disciplined or fired.

God View is available to all employees at the car-sharing service and allows them to see customer activity, such as where a person wants to be picked up.  

Caught: Uber has finished its investigation into New York City general manager Josh Mohrer for spying on the ride history of a journalist and has 'taken disciplinary actions' against the executive

Mohrer was accused of twice accessing the personal account of BuzzFeed reporter Johana Bhuiyan.

Buzzfeed is now reporting that Mohrer was disciplined. 

It is not known how he has been disciplined, but it’s clear the company found him in violation of its privacy policy.

News of the investigation followed a separate BuzzFeed story, which reported that another Uber executive recently threatened to look into the personal lives of journalists that have criticized Uber.

Emil Michael, Uber senior vice president for business, made his remarks in New York during a dinner that was also attended by Uber CEO Travis Kalanick and a list of prominent guests including actor Ed Norton, New York Daily News owner Mort Zuckerman and Huffington Post CEO Arianna Huffington, according to a USA Today column.

The column was written by Michael Wolff, a prominent journalist, who said he invited BuzzFeed editor Ben Smith to the Uber dinner without informing his guest that all conversations were supposed to be off the record. 

Wolff said most other guests at the dinner didn't hear the conversation between Michael and Smith.

Michael apologized for his remarks earlier this week.

Under-fire: Ashton Kutcher entered the firestorm surrounding taxi-hiring app Uber

Ashton Kutcher entered the firestorm surrounding under-fire taxi-hiring app Uber and defended controversial comments made by the executive who suggested spending $1million to dig up dirt on journalists who criticise the company.

Kutcher, an investor in the app, took to Twitter last Wednesday to show his support for beleaguered VP Emil Michael and described Sarah Lacy, a female journalist who has been highly critical of the company, as 'shady'.

'What is so wrong about digging up dirt on shady journalist?' tweeted the celebrity tech entrepreneur who has invested in tech firms including Skype, Foursquare, Airbnb and Spotify through his venture capital firm A-Grade. 

So as long as journalist are interested and willing to print half truths as facts... Yes we should question the source' he continued in a series of tweets before he sought to clarify that he was speaking for himself and not Uber.

'This should be fun... Here comes the part where journalist explain why they should be exempt from ridicule and judgement and probing...' he continued.

In a series of messages on his Twitter account, Kalanick rebuked Michael. 

'His remarks showed a lack of leadership, a lack of humanity, and a departure from our values and ideals,' Kalanick tweeted. Kalanick also tweeted that he and Michael would learn from their mistakes.

The incidents have triggered a wave of tweets calling for a boycott of Uber, whose competition in the rapidly growing car-booking industry includes Sidecar and Lyft. 

Some of the investors backing Lyft also own stakes in BuzzFeed.

It comes as a legal battle between Nevada's highly regulated taxi industry and Uber stumbled into complications as two state judges laid claim to hearing the same case.
