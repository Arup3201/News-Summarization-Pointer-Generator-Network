Shattered: Kia Graves is a former actress who once had a successful career with a modeling agency but since she was raped in 2012, she hasn't worked and her socially life has been shattered

A woman who was attacked and raped in her Manhattan apartment in 2012 has come forward to detail the horrific night a teenage pizza boy allegedly assaulted her as her 7-year-old daughter slept in the bed beside her.

Kia Graves, 37, reveals that her life has been utterly turned upside down since the night Cesar Lucas, 17, is charged with slipping into her apartment and having his way with her while out on a run for his father's 10th Avenue pizza restaurant.

'I have nightmares thinking that he’s getting out of jail, and I wake up all the time making sure my door is locked,' said the shell-shocked mom.

Unfortunately, her door was not locked that September night.

Cesar Lucas was working as a delivery 
boy at Sal’s Pizza in the same Manhattan 
neighborhood as the woman’s luxury apartment building.

He was delivering a pizza to the next-door flat when he noticed that the door was slightly ajar and allegedly entered the apartment.

Graves, a former actress turned model agency employee, had gone to bed with her daughter an hour and a half before the alleged incident.

It was the last time Grave says she's had a normal night's sleep.

'I sleep with one eye open, basically,' she told the New York Daily News. 'I have panic attacks and I wake up in sweats.'

Graves no longer works and lives each day crippled by her memories of the attack.

'I don’t know what to do,' she said. 'I’m just seeing my doctor and hoping for the best.'

In addition to her professional life, Graves said her social life has been left in shambles.

'I
 used to go out sometimes after work,' she told the Daily News. 'We used
 to have parties or go out. I used to date. I wasn’t a social butterfly,
 but I had a normal social life, definitely.'

Charged: Pizza delivery boy Cesar Lucas, who was 16 at the time, has pleaded not guilty to rape in court but confessed to 'sexual intercorse' with the 35-year-old in a handwritten note released by police

Graves still lives in the apartment where she was raped--a building in which she grew up and where her mother also lives to this day--and her deepest fear is that her attacker, who knows where she lives, will somehow come to find her.

'I’m scared that my rapist will get out of jail and he knows where I live,' she said. 'There’s constant fear and anxiety.'

And as much as she fears it, she may have to face her attacker in court.

Lucas
 returns to court Tuesday, his 18th birthday, and is charges with rape, 
sex abuse, burglary and of endangering the welfare of Graves' then 
7-year-old child.

Lucas 
pleaded not guilty to rape and burglary even as police released a 
handwritten letter, signed by the teen on the night of the alleged rape.

Meanwhile, Graves is suing the night doorman who was there the evening of the attack and was subsequently fired.

She's also suing Sal's Pizza, her condo building and management company.

The accused described ‘a type of disea’ which made him enter the victim’s flat after midnight on September 29, 2012.

He sexually assaulted the woman, who was sleeping in her bed with her daughter, police said.

Disturbing: The then 16-year-old was on a delivery for his father's restaurant Sal's Pizza on Manhattan's West Side. He'd been charged with breaking into apartments before

On the stand: Cesar was delivering pizza to a neighbour Graves' luxury condo complex in Manhattan when he attacked her as she slept next to her seven-year-old daughter

‘I screamed,’ the Graves told the Daily News at the time.

‘It took him about 30 seconds. I said, “Get off of me,” and I pushed him. He said “I’m sorry,” and ran out,’ she said.

Lucas
 was picked up by police at Sal's Pizza a short time later and charged 
with rape and burglary. He allegedly told police he was 'feeling horny'.

‘Cesar
 got type of disea in a way he never had felted before,’ the poorly 
written note reads. ‘I unrap her from all the coushing she had on top of
 her. She also started to feel horny, you can say,’

Continuing
 to refer to himself in the third person, Lucas Cesar then describes the
 sexual assault, claiming he had sexual intercourse with her for two 
minutes before leaving the apartment – but not before rummaging through 
her daughter’s purse and stealing $20, according to the New York Post.

The 16-year-old also claims the woman was ‘completely drunk’

‘I really was pretty scare because she was drunk and I kind ah took advantage of her.’

Appearing
 at Manhattan Supreme Court today, Lucas Cesar kept his head down and 
stared at the table in front of him until he was asked to plea.

He briefly lifted his head to speak the words ‘Not guilty’.

Upon his arrest, Cesar Lucas initially denied raping the woman, but admitted he had broken into the flat

‘What's going on? Why are you arresting me? I've been arrested before for the same thing. I broke into an apartment. It's still pending. I have to go to court,’ he said according to police statements released to the New York Post.

Lucas was referring to his arrest in August for breaking into a 39-year-old woman's apartment while making a delivery and stealing her wallet.

He was charged with burglary, criminal possession of stolen credit cards and theft of service, to which he has pleaded not guilty

Lucas was taken into custody on September 29 where he eventually made the horrific and grammatically appalling confession to rape.

He put all the blame on his ‘disea’, adding in the note that ‘Cesar didn't realized what kind of things he was about to do or make.’
