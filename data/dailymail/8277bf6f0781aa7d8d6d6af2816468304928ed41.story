A Florida man charged with hacking a homeless Connecticut man to death with an axe and eating his eye and part of his brain was ordered today to undergo a psychiatric evaluation.

Tyree Lincoln Smith, 35, stared blankly as he stood with his hands chained behind his back during his arraignment in Bridgeport Superior Court on a murder charge for the December killing of Andre Gonzalez.

Police in Bridgeport said Smith was 
covered in blood when he told his cousin about the murder, after 
developing a lust for blood he needed to satiate after eating a rare 
steak.

Superior Court Judge Earl Richards set Smith's bond at $1million at the urging of prosecutors, who described the crime as 'extremely heinous'.

It was his first court appearance 
since he was returned to Connecticut on Tuesday following his arrest 
last week in Lynn Haven, Florida, six miles northeast of Panama City.

The Connecticut Post reports that Judge Richards ordered the evaluation at the urging of Smith's lawyer, Public Defender Joseph Bruckmann, and ordered him to remain in custody in lieu of $1million bond. 

The judge also ordered Smith placed on a suicide watch at the Bridgeport Correctional Center at Bruckmann's urging. 

The next hearing was scheduled for February 14.

Smith, a Floridian who grew up in 
Ansonia, Connecticut, is charged in the December 15 killing of Angel 
Gonzalez, whose decomposed body was found on the third floor of an 
abandoned home in Bridgeport on January 23.

Police said the body significantly wounded and blood was spattered on a nearby wall.

According to the Post, police noticed one of the victim's eyeballs and a piece of his brain was missing when they found the body, but initially attributed that to rats.

Prosecutor Donal Collimore urged the judge to set a high bond, describing the crime as 'extremely heinous'.

Talitcha Frazier, a sister-in-law of the victim, said she remembered seeing Smith asking for change on the street.

'I think at the time I told him to get a job. I had no idea then that he had killed my brother-in-law,' Ms Frasier said on the courthouse steps after the hearing.

Smith came to the attention of authorities when his cousin in Connecticut, Nicole Rabb, contacted Bridgeport police about Gonzalez's slaying. 

Ms Rabb told detectives that Smith had arrived at her house December 15 and said he had developed a lust for blood after eating a rare steak and wanted to 'get blood on his hands'.

According to an arrest warrant 
affidavit, he left the woman's East End apartment with a small axe 
before going to the abandoned home, where he used to live.

The
next day, Smith returned to the cousin's house with blood on his pants,
hands and the axe, the affidavit said. Police say he told his cousin he
had 'gotten his blood'.

Ms
Rabb said Smith told her that he was sleeping on a porch at the 
abandoned home when he was awakened by another man and invited inside. 
Then Smith described beating the man's face and head with the axe and 
collecting one of his eyes and some of his brain matter, which he 
consumed over a male cousin's grave at the Lakeview cemetery, the 
affidavit said.

'Tyree told [Rabb] the blows to 
[Angel Gonzalez's] head were so severe that he was able to remove an eye
from the man's head along with pieces of brain matter and a piece of 
his skull,' the warrant reads, according to the Hartford Courant.

'At the cemetery he said he ate the eyeball, which tasted like an oyster, and the brain matter,' it continues.

As the Post reports, Ms Rabb told detectives she called Smith's mother, who suggested to police on December 16 that they check the abandoned home and that her son had 'mental issues', the affidavit said.

Smith had left Connecticut for Florida on Friday on a Greyhound bus, the cousin told detectives.

Lynn Haven police say federal, state 
and local law enforcement officers took him into custody last week at a woman's 
apartment without incident.

She told authorities she was unaware of his alleged actions.
