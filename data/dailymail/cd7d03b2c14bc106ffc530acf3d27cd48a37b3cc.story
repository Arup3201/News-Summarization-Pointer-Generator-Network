Japanese fishermen have finished killing some of the 250 dolphins trapped in what activists say was the biggest round-up they have witnessed in the last four years.

Sea Shepherd, best known for its anti-whaling activities, said the fishermen first selected 52 dolphins to keep alive for sale to aquariums and other customers.

They included a rare albino calf worth millions whose mother it reports may have committed suicide after being torn apart from her baby in the brutal separation process in Taiji.

Speculation has been rife ever since Sea Shepherd volunteers witnessed her diving under water then failing to resurface with the rest of the pod.

Experts say dolphins have been known to commit suicide in captivity after becoming distressed and confused at their conditions.

Did she kill herself? There is speculation that the mother of this albino dolphin trapped by Japanese fishermen in a cove has committed suicide after being torn apart from her baby

Harsh conditions: These poles are deployed above the water, and then the fishermen hit a flange on the top of the poles with a hammer, creating a cacophony that drives the dolphins back out to sea

In several cases, the creatures repeatedly slammed their head against sides of a pool - or simply stopped coming up for air.

Writing on its website, Sea Shepherd said: 'There is widespread speculation that the mother of the albino calf committed suicide after her baby was violently taken from her.

'Our volunteer Cove Guardians documented and witnessed the grieving mother repeatedly spy-hopping, looking for her calf, before lowering herself into the water, never to resurface.

'Dolphins are highly intelligent, socially complex beings who form close bonds with their family, and the trade for captivity regularly rips through these bonds in Taiji.'

The theory has been taken up by Ric O' Barry, a former dolphin trainer
 who is convinced the mother took her own life as a result of the ordeal.

Annual process: The fishing crew are pictured transferring several dolphins into the 250-strong pod

Rounded up: The dolphins were forced to wait in the pen for 19 hours until the holding reached critical mass

As conscious breathers, he said dolphins can choose not to take their next breath.

Mr O'Barry, who founded the Dolphin Project,  told The Dodo: 'People don't believe me, but dolphins do it all the time.

'Captivity is extremely stressful and there is nothing more stressful to a dolphin than taking away its calf.'

The fishermen reportedly hid the baby dolphin under a tarpaulin and transferred it to Taiji Whale Museum.

Assistant Director Tetsuo Kirihata said: 'Albinos stand out and tend to be targeted by predators. 

'She must have been protected by her mother and her mates. We will take good care of her.'

Tradition: Each year the fishermen capture and kill a huge amount of dolphins, putting the population at risk

Mr
 Barry - who used to train Dolphins for the TV series Flipper - became 
an activist in the 1970s after being left traumatised when one of the show's stars, Kathy, died in
 his arms.

He has always asserted that she had committed suicide by refusing to breathe after spending years in captivity.

There
 have been previous cases of suspected dolphin suicides, the largest of 
which occurred in 2007 when 152 striped dolphins washed up on the coast 
of southern Iran.

Locals who
 battled to save them by taking them back out to sea were distraught 
when the dolphins refused and persistently re-beached themselves to die.

A year later, one expert theorised that the deaths of 26 dolphins on a beach in Cornwall have been a mass suicide.

The animals had died after inhaling debris and mud that clogged their insides.

Speaking
 at the time, Veterinary wildlife pathologist Vic Simpson said: 'On the 
face of it, it looks like some sort of mass suicide - but the question 
is why?

'The dolphins had 
swallowed and inhaled big chunks of mud from the estuary. Their lungs 
and stomachs were full of it. That is very bizarre indeed.

'We have seen strandings on beaches, sometimes with five to seven dolphins - but never on a scale like this.'

However, other experts are far more sceptical.

Dr
 Ann Weaver, who studies dolphins in Tampa Bay, believes suicide is a 
uniquely human notion, although she did acknowledge that animals can get
 depressed.

She said: 'I think everything they are designed to be is to keep on keeping on.

'So
 I think suicide is the curse of the human consciousness, but not other 
consciousnesses, she told told the Huffington Post in 2010.

Of
 the rest of the 250 dolphins trapped in the Japanese cove, about 40 were killed,
 one became stuck in a net and drowned and the others were released, Sea
 Shepherd said.

A video 
released Tuesday by Sea Shepherd shows dozens of fishermen on boats 
surveying the dolphins after they were confined to a cove with nets.

Divers can be seen holding the dolphins selected for sale and guiding them to nets hanging off the boats.

While
 other dolphins have been killed since the hunting season began in 
September, Sea Shepherd said the 250 herded into the cove last Friday 
was the largest group it has seen since it began monitoring the hunt.

The
 annual hunt in the village of Taiji received high-profile criticism 
when U.S. Ambassador to Japan Caroline Kennedy tweeted last weekend that
 she was deeply concerned about the practice.

The fishermen say the hunt is part of their tradition and call foreign critics who eat other kinds of meat hypocritical.

A
 Japanese government spokesman defended the annual dolphin hunt on 
Monday, saying it is carried out in accordance with the law.

The hunt was the subject of the Academy Award-winning 2009 film The Cove.

The dolphins will be uncomfortably oblivious of the impending doom some of them will suffer at the hands of the fishermen. They are captured around four to five at a time until enough of them are collected for 'selection'

Treatment: The fishermen brutally kill the dolphins they do not set free or capture using a sharp spike or spear

Cramped: The cove does not provide much space for the dolphins to swim, forcing them to huddle up in groups
