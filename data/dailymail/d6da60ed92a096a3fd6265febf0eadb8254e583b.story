Everyone has accidentally knocked a glass of water or mug of coffee over to find that the liquid has flooded an important document or ruined a favourite item placed nearby.

But now a U.S. company claims that such tabletop trauma could be a thing of the past as it has invented a tall cup that is impossible to knock over.

The Mighty Mug has been branded a 'tower of strength' and can reportedly withstand, hitting, pushing, slapping and poking without falling over and spilling its contents.

A U.S. company has invented a cup that it claims is impossible to knock over. The Mighty Mug is tall but can withstand hitting, pushing, slapping and poking without tumbling over and spilling its contents

The mug has 'smartgrip technology' that stops it falling over but does not require users to push buttons or pull levers to enable the cup to leave the surface of a table or desk.

When the smartgrip base is placed on a smooth, flat surface, a small amount of air is trapped beneath it, creating a vacuum that locks the mug in place and prevent the possibility of someone accidentally knocking it over.

The vacuum is instantly released when a user lifts the cup - requiring no extra effort when they want to drink from it, unlike with some other designs.

The cup has been a big hit in the U.S. and will be sold in the UK for £20. As well as its vacuum base, the mug has insulated walls to keep drinks hot or cold as well as a lockable, leak-proof lid, pictured right

The Mighty Mug also has insulated walls to maintain the temperature of hot or cold liquid and a leak-proof lid so that when it is locked the drink is sealed inside.

It holds up to 500ml of liquid, is dishwasher and microwave safe and is made of eco-friendly biodegradable plastic that takes five years to disintegrate.

The cup has been on sale in the U.S. where it was a big success and will now be sold in the UK too.

Might Mug comes in three colours and costs £20.
