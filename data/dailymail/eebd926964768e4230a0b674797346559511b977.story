Dr Maureen Baker warned that GPs needed an extra £1 billion of taxpayers' money to recruit sufficient staff to keep practices open at weekends

More than 20,000 extra GPs, nurses and other NHS staff are needed if David Cameron wants his plan for surgeries to open seven days a week to work, the head of the family doctor's royal college has warned.

In her first major television interview since taking up the post, Dr Maureen Baker told Sky News that GPs needed an extra £1 billion of taxpayers' money to recruit sufficient staff to keep practices open at weekends.

Without the extra money, the NHS risks becoming unsustainable as GPs and hospitals struggle to cope with the extra demand from patients over the winter months, she said.

Dr Baker took over as head of the Royal College of GPs in November, a month after the Prime Minister declared his intention to get GPs to work more hours.

But in an outspoken attack on the policy to be broadcast today she said that the idea was unrealistic unless the government was prepared to fund more staff. GP numbers would need to increase by a quarter alone, she suggested.

'If we were to move to seven days a week we would need 10,000 more GPs,' she said. 'We probably need the same number of practice nurses and a proportionate number of support staff. We don't think seven days a week is realistic'.

According to the BMA there are just over 40,000 GPs currently working in the UK. The RCGP has previously suggested that 10,000 more would be needed for 7 day a week opening to function. However, it is believed to be the first time the College has warned that an equivalent number of nurses and support staff would be required as well.

In a dire assessment of the current state of GP practices, Dr Baker said that family doctors feel 'besieged' as they struggle to deal with the influx of winter patients.

'It is constant demand with very little let up,' she said. 'We know our colleagues are working 11-12 hour days and that is really difficult to do day after day when it is a job you need to be on top form for. They are feeling pressurised and besieged and looking for a bit of respite.'

Waiting times for appointments were rising, she said, leading to concerns that their treatment could be compromised.

GPs need more resources, she said.

'The consequence (of not having extra resources) will be the winter pressure effect that comes up every year gets longer and longer. My fear is the whole of the NHS becomes unsustainable due to the failure to properly invest in general practice.'

She also criticised the government's £500 million to hospitals to cope this winter.

'It wasn't the best use of money. It was a short term fix, finger in the dyke stuff,' she said. 'There is nothing about the use of that money that will stop the same pressures emerging again and again.'

And she denied that full GP practices were to blame for increased numbers attending A&E

'The problem is we have an increase in the number of patients turning up in ambulances very sick.'

In October the Prime Minister said he would like GP surgeries to open from 8am until 8pm and over the weekends to fit in with the lifestyles of working people. He said a £50m pilot scheme would be rolled out across the country.

He told Sky News : 'Sometimes people using accident and emergency really just need to see a GP but for hard-working people it is often too difficult because you are at work, you can't get an appointment at the time that fits.

'Let's see if we can have GPs' surgeries open 12 hours a day, seven days a week so you can always get that appointment you need.'

A Department of Health spokesperson said: 'GPs do a vital job which is why we increased their overall budget last year as part of our protection of NHS funding. We have made £50 million available to help innovative GPs to extend their services and stay open longer — either on their own or by working with other local practices. We have also asked Health Education England to see how we can get 50 per cent of medical students to become GPs.

'Our changes to the GP contract will free GPs from unnecessary red tape so they can devote more time to patients. This goes hand in hand with a £3.8billion fund to join up health and social care and support the delivery of integrated services.'
