Asking this judge to walk the line proved to be something of a challenge, but the case against the justice from South Texas who was charged with drunk driving, has been dismissed despite video showing her stumbling after being pulled over by police.

Hidalgo County officials said there was not enough evidence to prosecute 13th Court of Appeals Justice Nora Longoria who is 49, however the video showing her making a mess of a simple test for drunkenness was only released after the charges were dropped. 

She was stopped for a traffic violation in July and charged with misdemeanor driving while intoxicated.

She walks the line: A month after a Texas court threw out a DUI case against a judge because it lacked strong evidence, police released dashcam video of her arrest that showed her stumble through a sobriety test

It's a fine line: The new video, recorded during a July traffic stop in McAllen, showed Nora Longoria struggling to walk a straight line. She teetered and lost her balance several times

Reports state Longoria "had trouble with her balance and swayed from side to side and displayed red, glossy eyes," 

A fellow Judge, Rolando Cantu, dismissed the case against her last week.

Now McAllen police have released dashcam video that led to her DWI arrest.

The video is evidence Hidalgo County DA Rene Guerra said they never got.

Judged: After being taken to the police station where she continued to be difficult with police, she finally admitted to drinking five beers earlier in the evening. Longoria later posted $2,000 bond and was released from custody

Police said the footage is crucial evidence that could have been used to prosecute Longoria. 

The footage shows she struggled to walk a straight line, and even stumbled several times during the test.

The arresting officer said during sobriety tests, Longoria complained the officer was "ruining her life and career for what he was doing." She also reportedly said, "I worked hard for 25 years to be where I'm at today."

Longoria failed the sobriety tests and then became emotional and "refused to be handcuffed," authorities say.

The police officer who stopped Logoria for driving 69 mph in a 55 mph zone said she begged him not to arrest her

Police say she refused to let officers handcuff her or to provide breath and blood tests.  

They say Longoria told officers they would have to drag her to the patrol car. 

After being taken to the police station where she continued to be difficult with police, she finally admitted to drinking five beers earlier in the evening.

Longoria later posted $2,000 bond and was released from custody.

District Attorney Rene Guerra tells the McAllen Monitor that Longoria didn't appear to have slurred speech in a recording at the jail.

 There isn’t a recording of the traffic stop. Longoria is represented by Democratic state Sen. Juan “Chuy” Hinojosa of McAllen.  

Longoria sits on the 13th Court of Appeals, which serves the region extending from Corpus Christi south to Edinburg. She was elected to the court in 2012.
