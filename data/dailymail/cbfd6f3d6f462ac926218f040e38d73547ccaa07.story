They are have divided public opinion - some people love them, while others hate their very existence.

And now, the organizers of two major US festivals have made clear what they think of selfie sticks.

The Coachella Valley Music and Arts Festival and Lollapalooza are the latest in a string of concert venues and historic landmarks to ban the use of the controversial tech gadgets on their grounds.

While the latter has named 'GoPro attachments like sticks, selfie sticks & monopods' on its list of prohibited items, Coachella has banned festivalgoers from bringing 'Selfie sticks/Narsisstics (sic)'.

Prohibited: Lollapalooza , meanwhile, allows attendees to bring blankets, sheets, hand-held umbrellas and cameras for personal use. However, it bans chairs, bicycles, tents and large hiking backpacks (pictured)

However, it remains unclear how organizers intend to identify and weed out 'narcissists' at the gates of the festival, which begins in Indio, California on April 10 - more than three months before Lollapalooza.

And selfie sticks are not the only unusual items to be banned at the two festivals. Coachella also prohibits blankets, chairs, flags, hula hoops, marker pens, stuffed animals and umbrellas on its list.

Lollapalooza, meanwhile, allows festivalgoers to bring blankets, sheets, towels, hand-held umbrellas and cameras for personal use. However, it bans chairs, bicycles, tents and large hiking backpacks.

The addition of selfie sticks to the  lists has taken the internet by storm. Many users have deemed the ban positive, others have reacted with disappointment and some have posted humorous responses.

The ban, first reported by Brooklyn Vegan, will prevent selfie sticks from obstructing festivalgoers' views of the stage - and could limit the illegal recording of performances, according to Rolling Stone. 

It will likely mean attendees will have to resort to the old-fashioned method of using their arms to take selfies. Other festivals like Bonnaroo and Governors Ball are yet to mention selfie sticks in their rules. 

Coachella, which is being headlined by AC/DC, Jack White and Drake, takes place on April 10-12 and 17-19 on the Empire Polo Field site. All festivalgoers are subject to a search at the venue's entrance.

Last year, attendees took to Twitter to complain after Instagram crashed on the second day of the festival, preventing them from posting selfies of their faces and carefully curated outfits online.
