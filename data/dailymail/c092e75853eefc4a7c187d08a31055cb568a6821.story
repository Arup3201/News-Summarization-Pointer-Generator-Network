These never-before-seen images show a teenage Reeva Steenkamp in her days as a law student through the eyes of a close friend before her sparkling modelling career took off.

As her boyfriend Oscar Pistorius begins a five-year jail sentence for her manslaughter, they offer a poignant insight into the innocent and beautiful life he cut tragically short.

In one set of photographs, she is seen posing happily on a beach in South Africa, while others show her enjoying sleepovers and hot tubs with her university friends. 

They were captured by close friend Kerry Smith, 37, who attended university with Reeva in Port Elizabeth, South Africa, where they both grew up.

The images were a 'bittersweet reminder' of Miss Steenkamp for Mrs Smith, who spoke at the 29-year-old's funeral days after she was shot dead by the Paralympian on Valentine's Day last year. 

Mrs Smith said: 'Looking at these pictures, seeing Reeva laughing - going from that and then having to speak in front of her coffin, it's surreal. You just can't wrap your head around it.'

An aspiring photographer, she tested her camera skills using Miss Steenkamp as her subject - and the result was a beautiful set of photos of the then-aspiring model. 

Miss Steenkamp would go on to graduate with a law degree at the Nelson Mandela Metropolitan University, but made a dynamic career change after being scouted and named the first face of cosmetics giant Avon South Africa.

She also worked for prestigious clients such as Toyota, FHM, Clover and Italian brand Zui. 

One set of photos shot by Mrs Kerry show Miss Steenkamp, then 19, posing innocently at Sardinia Bay in Port Elizabeth.

She said: 'If there was ever any proof anyone needed to show that Reeva was truly a natural beauty, this is it.

'She did not have a stitch of make-up on and we didn't do anything fancy with her hair.

'She told me she wanted to go back into the modelling industry, but was hesitant because she wanted to have a stable career.

'She said "modeling can't be forever because we get older, beauty fades, wrinkles appear".'

Despite her doubts, Mrs Smith managed to convince her to go to the beach for a few shots.

Mrs Smith added: 'She was shy and self-conscious at first, but eventually grew comfortable in front of the camera.

'Reeva was always the down-to-earth girl next door - you can see that the first few photos are of her in a black polar neck sweater with no flesh showing, and later with a bare midriff.

'The whole process was drowned out in fits of laughter while we tried to be professional and serious.' 

Other photos taken by Kerry show Miss Steenkamp sporting pyjamas and drinking coffee with university friends at a sleepover.

Mrs Smith said: 'She had this really loud laugh, it wasn't cute and giggly - it was one of those laughs that made everyone laugh too.'

She met Miss Steenkamp at the University of Port Elizabeth in 2002, where they both studied law. 

Mrs Smith said she and Miss Steenkamp were passionate about issues like domestic violence and discussed plans to one day open up a clinic for women who were in abusive relationships.

'Reeva wouldn't back down from things that she stood against,' she said. 'She wouldn't keep quiet, and didn't change at all even when she was in the model business.'  

'We were all asked to break off into groups for a project, and Reeva was in my group,' said Kerry.

'We lived just up the block from each other, and we rode into school together in the morning. It blossomed from there and we became the closest of friends.'

But she said the two grew apart after graduation in 2005 over of a clash of opinions about Kerry's partner at the time.

Kerry said: 'I was in an unhappy relationship. Reeva didn't like my partner and couldn't understand why I was with him, so we stopped talking.

'She contacted me in 2007, after she found out that I had left him. She said it was her dream come true and she was glad I found happiness.' 

On February 14, 2013, Pistorius was arrested for questioning after shooting and killing the model  at his home in Pretoria, South Africa.

He was formally charged with murder the next day - but claimed he shot Miss Steenkamp thinking she was an intruder.

Pistorius testified during his murder trial that he mistook Miss Steenkamp (above) for a dangerous intruder about to come out of the cubicle and attack him when he shot four times through the door with his 9mm pistol

As Oscar's trial began, Kerry was painfully reminded of Reeva's tragic death.

Kerry said: 'I was riveted at the outset of the trial and despite my personal connection to the matter I tried to keep an unbiased view when listening to the evidence being read.

'The only time I broke down was when I saw the head shot of Reeva which showed her wounds.

'I remember wondering "why is her hair black?" and then I realised it was all the blood.'

Last month, he was acquitted of murder, but found guilty of culpable homicide. He was sentenced to five years in jail today. 

Speaking of verdict, Mrs Smith said: 'When the judge delivered a "not guilty" (of murder) verdict - I was horrified.

'I had to drive to my son's school for a sports game after hearing it.

'When I turned off the TV, I left to the school totally disillusioned with the outcome and for the first time since the trial started, I broke down.

'I still have no closure of her death - in my mind Reeva is still so vibrant and alive. I miss Reeva. I really, really miss her.'
