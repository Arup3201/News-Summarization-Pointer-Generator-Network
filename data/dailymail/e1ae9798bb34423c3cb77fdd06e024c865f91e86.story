A woman deputy head who with a teaching assistant lifted a six-year-old boy by the armpits and carried him into school was banned from teaching by the teacher's watchdog.

Deborah Ellis, 51, of Mold in North Wales, used 'inappropriate force' after she tackled the pupil who refused to return to class and wanted to lie face down in the sun instead.

Mrs Ellis who taught at the Hafod y Wern primary school in Wrexham said she had acted because she feared for the boy's safety when he refused to budge.

She claimed the school was short staffed, drug users hung about the area and there was a danger of abduction.

But CCTV footage captured part of the incident in June 2010 which showed the boy being dragged.

Following the incident she was sacked by the school but an the eve of an employment tribunal for unfair dismissal last March she reached a cash settlement with the local authority.

At the time her solicitor said she'd suffered 'a grave injustice.'

The professional conduct committee of 
the General Teaching Council for Wales decided her actions amounted to 
unacceptable professional conduct.

Lousha Brill, who presented the case 
to the committee, said Mrs Ellis was the behavioural co-ordinator at the
school and should have set an example.

She said: 'She has not shown insight or expressed regret.'

The panel ruled Mrs Ellis could only return to the classroom after a six month suspension and she  has satisfactorily completed courses in 'challenging behaviour and physical intervention.'

Chairwoman Rhiannon Streets said that there had been 'other options' than manhandling the boy.

Mrs Ellis should have got another member of staff
to sit with the boy known as Pupil AÂ  as she knew his mother had been contacted.

She said: 'She has shown insufficient insight into
the seriousness of the incident or the inappropriateness of her 
intervention having regard to the needs of the pupil.'

It was also ruled she had failed to report the incident to the head when he returned from a course, not made a note of the incident, ignored Welsh Government 'intervention' guidelines and 
had involved the teaching assistant in a disciplinary offence.

School staff have legal powers to use 'reasonable' force to stop pupils from committing crimes, injuring themselves or others, and damaging property.

Guidelines say that force should only be used as a last resort and schools are urged not to have a 'no contact' policy as it could prevent a teacher from acting.

One way for teachers to intervene is to act as a block between pupils or stand in their way.

In instances where there is need for more control, they can lead a pupil by the hand or arm or ushering them away by placing a hand in the centre of their back.

In extreme circumstances such as fighting, self defence and attacks on other teachers, they may also use restraint.

The committee also took into account 18 months after the complaint was made and while on anti-depressants she was involved in a car crash when three times over the drink-drive limit.

She was subsequently convicted of drink driving.

Mrs Elllis did not attended the hearing at Ewloe in Flintshire but said she was now teetotal and her overriding concern had been for the boy's welfare.

She denied she caused any physically or emotionally abuse to the boy.

But Simon Edwards, headmaster of the 260-pupil school, told the hearing child protection training made it clear that they must not have gratuitous physical contact with young children, only to prevent real risk and immediate harm.

He was shown the CCTV footage after he returned which he said depicted the dragging of a small child and looked to him like inappropriate behaviour.

After showing the film to the governors' chairman, social services were contacted and a 'child protection' investigation was launched.

When asked what Mrs Ellis should have done, he said she and the assistant should 
have sat down next to the child and chatted.

If that failed either the parents or grandparents, both of whom lived within 100 yards of the 
school, should have been called.

Police took no action over the incident.
