She has been working out extensively in recent months, and judging by her latest modelling shots, Rosie Huntington-Whiteley's intense exercise regime is paying off.

The model looks incredible as she showcases her perfectly toned body in the latest campaign images for her lingerie line with Marks and Spencer.

The Rosie for Autograph Autumn 13 lingerie collection celebrates the one year anniversary of this exclusive collaboration between the model and the High Street giant.

Now that's one way to celebrate! Rosie Huntington-Whiteley is celebrating one year of her lingerie line with M&S by stripping off for a stunning set of campaign images

The new collection of sophisticated pieces, which range in price from £12.50 for pants to £125 for a wrap, uses luxurious fabrics such as silk and French designed lace, which aims to put a vintage spin on her original designs.

The palette is rich and sumptuous, with deep mauve and dusky pink bras, as well as more natural tones such as olive green and taupe.

Key items within the anniversary collection include both updates on favourite styles and brand new pieces, which the retailer hopes will keep the collection fresh.

The popular silk kimono wrap has been reworked in mauve silk with placement rose print detailing and Rosie has added a brand new teddy all-in-one with a sexy silk spin.

Speaking about the new collection and anniversary celebrations, Rosie Huntington-Whiteley said: 'I can’t quite believe it’s been a whole year since the Rosie for Autograph launch, it’s gone so fast!

'For my one year anniversary collection, I’m loving the new shapes and, as well as including my signature soft colours, I’ve experimented with a darker, richer palette, perfect for the Autumn season.'

The work-out has paid off! Rosie has been working extremely hard in recent weeks and has been spotted leaving the gym most days, which is obviously working

Soozie Jenkinson, Head of Lingerie Design at M&S, added: 'We took influence from the natural glamour and romanticism of the pre-Raphelites for this new collection, the richness of nature combined with the ethereal spirit of the art movement influenced both our colour palette and the hand painted rose bloom artwork.'

Following a successful year, which has seen the exclusive collaboration become one of the most popular lingerie collections ever launched by M&S, this one year anniversary collection looks set to be a firm favourite this Autumn.

26-year-old Rosie has been working 
extensively with personal trainer James Duigan- creator of the Bodyism system and bestselling author of The Clean and Lean diet - in order to keep her body
in perfect shape.

Jealous, us? Rosie first launched her lingerie range with Autograph a year ago and it has become one of the best-selling ranges the high-street giant have ever witnessed

But
while Rosie clearly enjoys a work out, Duigan, who has also worked with Elle Macpherson and Nigella Lawson, maintains her strict diet is one
of the reasons she’s able to maintain her incredible figure.

‘Rosie makes a mean guacamole which 
is a filling and nutrient dense snack,’ he told news.com. ‘About half an
avocado a day is the perfect way to include fat-fighting in your diet.’

But despite eating healthily, Devon-born Rosie admits she isn't a fan of fad diets.

Speaking
to Vogue, she said: ‘I’m not really one for fad diets, I like to keep 
things simple. I grew up on a farm, so if I want to detox or shed some 
weight or eat cleanly I’ll cut out carbs and refined sugars. So that’s 
my tip for eating well: Nothing extreme.’ 

The British star also admits to 
being a huge fan of physical exercise and does her best to squeeze her 
work-outs in as often as possible.

‘I
love exercise,’ she said.  ‘For me, all my confidence starts there – 
with my exercise. It’s not just about being in shape, it also improves 
my well-being.

‘I feel better about myself, it boosts my confidence. And that for me is where the beauty regime starts, in the gym.’
