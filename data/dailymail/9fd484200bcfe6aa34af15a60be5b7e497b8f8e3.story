Alan Pardew will attempt to bring goals to Newcastle as he prepares for an intensely difficult start to the Christmas campaign.

The Magpies travel to in-form Manchester United on Boxing Day on the back of three successive defeats, the last of them a 1-0 reverse at the hands of neighbours Sunderland, an unprecedented fourth consecutive derby loss.

Just a few weeks ago, it would have been a fixture Pardew's men might have approached with some relish having already dispensed with Tottenham, Manchester City, Liverpool and Chelsea.

Newcastle showed no signs of a hangover following their 1-0 defeat against Sunderland

Asked if his team had saved its best performances for the Barclays Premier League's big boys, the 53-year-old replied: 'Yes and no.

'Some of the top clubs, we have not played so well - Arsenal, we didn't play well, but Spurs we beat, Liverpool we beat as well.

'We can raise our game, but we don't score a lot of goals, and that's something that is a concern, really, going into the second half of the season, how many goals we have scored.

'That's an area we are going to have to improve on against any team.

'But when you play the top teams, you can keep it tight and one goal, two goals can sometimes be enough. But not always, and we need to score more goals.'

Newcastle have fared reasonably well on their most recent league visits to Old Trafford, drawing 1-1 there in November 2011, losing by the odd goal in seven on Boxing Day the following year and finally ending a 41-year wait for a victory in December last year.

Pardew said: 'We have had decent performances at Old Trafford, I think, in the last three. We drew, we lost in the last minute - which was a cracking game - 4-3, and then we won last year, so we have done reasonably well there.

'One of the reasons we have one well there is we have retained possession well, and that's something we are going to have to do because you can't turn possession over to Manchester United with the quality they have got up front.

'They are going well at the minute. They are on a great run, and it's a game that every time you play them, you have to look forward to it. I certainly do and I am sure our senior players and young players will too.'

One of those young players is 21-year-old keeper Jak Alnwick, who has been thrust into the limelight by injuries to senior men Tim Krul and Rob Elliot.

His opposite number on Friday, Spaniard David de Gea, has emerged as the bedrock of United's improving form, and Pardew knows how difficult it will be to find a way past him.

He said: 'There's a contrast in goal at the moment: Jak is on his second or third Premier League start, and De Gea pushing (Manuel) Neuer for the title of being the best goalkeeper in the world.

'He's a fantastic shot-stopper. He still has parts of his game that he still wishes to develop, but in one on one situations, he excels and covers a lot of the areas where goalscorers want to score in, with his feet, his hands and how he wants to approach things.

'He makes it very difficult to score, so you have to go with power and go for the corners.'
