Honda is to axe 800 jobs – a quarter of its UK workforce – blaming a collapse in demand for cars across Europe.

The Japanese firm’s first ever compulsory cull of employees was described by unions as ‘a hammer blow’ and by ministers as ‘a bitter disappointment’.

Staff at the factory in Swindon were told the news as they arrived for work today.

Honda builds the Jazz, Civic and CR-V models in Swindon. About 150,000 vehicles were rolled out last year, a third of which are sold in the UK with the rest exported, mainly to Europe.

MARCH 2008: Nearly 80,000 Honda civics are recalled due to a fault with the handbrake.DECEMBER 2008: Honda exits Formula One due to the global financial crisis.JANUARY 2009: Honda shuts down all production in Swindon for four months. Workers were put on full basic pay for the first two months but this was lowered to 60 per cent for the remainder of the shut down.FEBRUARY 2011: Honda reports 40 per cent drop in third-quarter profits after overseas sales were hit by the strong yen, by this time Swindon is producing 140,000 Honda cars a year, compared to 230,000 in 2008.APRIL 2012: Honda is forced to halve production in Swindon because of a parts shortage following the Japanese earthquake and tsunami.SEPTEMBER 2012: Honda announces a £267million investment programme in Swindon including the creation of 500 jobs. The expected extra demand never materialised.JANUARY 2013: Honda breaks news to workers that 800 jobs will be axed at the Swindon plant.

The redundancies mark a dramatic U-turn for Honda, which recently announced almost £300million of investment to boost production in Swindon  and a year ago took on 500 extra workers.

The firm says UK sales rose 7 per cent last year but its anticipated rise in demand did not materialise in Europe, where sales fell by 8 per cent.

Ken Keir, executive vice-president of Honda Motor Europe, said: ‘Sustained low demand in European markets make it necessary to realign our business structure.

As such, Honda will enter into formal consultation [with its employees] to consider these changes and the proposal that it will reduce the workforce by 800 by the spring.’

The Unite union said the firm was cutting 420 managers and supervisors, and 360 production workers, and that when a recent cull of 325 temporary workers is included the true level of job cuts was more than 1,100.

Unite national officer Tony Murphy said: ‘This is a hammer blow to UK manufacturing and to Swindon where Honda is a major employer.

'The reality is that over 1,000 jobs are going at Honda. It is a disaster for manufacturing in the UK and for the local economy.’

He also warned there would be ‘a significant knock-on impact’ on supply firms and services.

Honda employs 3,500 people and has invested £2billion since setting up in Britain in 1992.

In 2009, the company called for and 
got 1,600 voluntary redundancies as it shut down the Swindon plant for 
six months and put all remaining staff on basic pay.

Honda stressed that despite the job cuts, the £267million investment that it announced last year would be unaffected.
