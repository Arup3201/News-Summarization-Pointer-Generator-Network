Abby Hernandez, the New Hampshire teen who vanished for nine months before returning home, has said she is 'feeling a lot better every day'.

The 15-year-old, who vanished on October 9 as she left her high school, also revealed that she often saw her local newspaper during her time in captivity - and she felt hope when she saw its box noting the number of days she had been missing because she knew people were still looking for her.

She spoke to the media in person for the first time on Thursday morning as she visited the offices of the newspaper, The Conway Daily Sun, to express her thanks for their commitment to the case.

'I'm taking it a little at a time but I'm feeling a lot better every day,' she told staff. 'I'd just like to be treated like a normal person.'

She was joined by her mother Zenya, who said that she had also seen the boxes counting the days her daughter had been missing - but for her, it was tough to see.

'As
 sad as it was to see the days growing and increasing, we truly thank 
you,' she said. 'Abby saw that off and on. She didn't see it every 
day. It gave her hope that people were looking.'

Abby returned home on July 20 but the circumstances of her disappearance, where she was held and how she ended back home have not been released by authorities.

But it is widely believed that the teenager was held captive in a storage container on the property of alleged kidnapper, Nathaniel Kibby, 34, from Gorham.

He has been charged with her kidnapping - but on Thursday it emerged that he might have left her in a safe place, the Boston Herald reported.

He released her 'without serious
 bodily injury and in a safe place', according to the state law he is 
being prosecuted under.

Under the New Hampshire law, most kidnappers are jailed for more than seven years - unless they voluntarily released the victim without injury and to a safe place. Then they will serve a maximum of seven years.

As questions still remain over exactly what happened to the teen, authorities were seen scouring a river near to Kibby's property on Thursday. K-9 units were also brought in.

Neighbors have described Kibby as a gun nut who was obsessed with conspiracy theories, hated authority and believed that one day there would be a zombie apocalypse.

But while many of Kibby's neighbors have described him as 'scary' they said there was no indication he was hiding a teenage girl on his property.

Kibby, who is being held on $1 million bail, will next appear in court for a probable cause hearing on August 12, when additional charges against him are expected.
