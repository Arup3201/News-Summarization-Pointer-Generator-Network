A two-year-old girl is being treated in hospital after she was kidnapped, raped and dumped by the roadside in north India.

The unnamed toddler was snatched from her parents as they slept in a slum in Ludhiana, Punjab province, police said.

When her father awoke on Tuesday morning at 2am local time he found his daughter was gone, along with 8,000 rupees (Â£80).

She was found several hours later by a man who called police and she was immediately taken to hospital.

Though police claim to have rounded up several people, the main suspects are currently an 80-year-old man and and another who is disabled

The harrowing news comes on the same day in which a prosecutor asked for the death penalty for four men who gang-raped a 23-year-old on a bus in Delhi who later died.

Today a prosecutor has asked for the death penalty for four men found guilty of gang-rape and murder in Delhi

Disturbing cases of female abuse in India have shocked the world and led to waves of protest

The men are set to be sentenced on Friday after they were found guilty of rape and murder yesterday in the case which shocked the world and prompted a widespread movement for women's rights in India.

'They showed no mercy even when she prayed for mercy,' Prosecutor Dayan Krishnan told the court. 'There should be no mercy for merciless convicts.

'The sentence which is appropriate is nothing short of death. The common man will lose faith in the judiciary if the harshest punishment is not given.'
