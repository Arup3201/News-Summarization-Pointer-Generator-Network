Britain's biggest power boss claims households will not see a ‘meaningful’ drop in energy bills until next year.

Iain Conn, the new chief executive of British Gas’s parent company Centrica, said the group would not pass on the falling cost of energy to customers until 2016.

The price of oil has more than halved since last summer, while gas – the main source of electricity in Britain – has dropped by 29 per cent.

But power firms have reduced their prices only modestly.

Britain's largest power boss claims households will not see a ‘meaningful’ drop in energy bills until next year

British Gas will cut its prices by 5 per cent at the end of this month.

EDF has trimmed rates by just 1.3 per cent, while SSE has been ridiculed for refusing to introduce its 4.1 per cent cut until the end of April.

Mr Conn, who is on a £3.7 million pay deal at Centrica, said the power giant would not lower prices again because it had bought all of its current energy in advance almost two years ago when prices were much higher.

He said that bills ‘will not come down unless energy prices continue to stay down’.

It means that power tariffs in 2016 ‘will be much more meaningfully impacted’ by the current fall in prices, he added.

This is what critics feared when Ed Miliband pledged to freeze prices for two years if Labour wins power at the election in May. The policy has been widely criticised, and experts say many energy companies would have cut their tariffs sooner if the threat was not in place.

Critics have also warned that the move would sap investment from Britain.

Yesterday the Centrica group reported a 35 per cent fall in its profits – but still made £1.75 billion last year.

British Gas’s profits from supplying households with power fell 23 per cent to £463 million, largely because of warm weather last year and customers switching to smaller suppliers. Almost 400,000 abandoned British Gas during the year.

Mr Conn said British Gas made an average of £42 profit per customer. The energy regulator Ofgem has previously said the true figure for large energy providers was £114.

The Centrica group blamed the falling price of oil and the warm weather for its drop in profits. It took the controversial decision to cut its dividend to shareholders by 30 per cent. This particularly hit its 650,000 small shareholders, many of whom have owned shares since the company was privatised by Margaret Thatcher in 1986.

Centrica also said it would cut spending on oil projects in the North Sea by up to 40 per cent.

Ann Robinson, consumer policy director at the price comparison website uSwitch dismissed Mr Conn’s defence of his tariffs. She said: ‘If that’s how Centrica are buying and trading their energy then they are quite frankly inefficient.’

Richard Lloyd, executive director at the consumer group Which? said: ‘The modest price cuts have done little to convince consumers that they’ve had the full benefit of a significant shift in wholesale costs.’

Mr Conn’s remarks come only a day after the competition watchdog warned that loyal energy customers were paying too much.

The Competition and Markets Authority said that families who stayed on default tariffs paid £234 a year more than those who switch to cheaper rates.
