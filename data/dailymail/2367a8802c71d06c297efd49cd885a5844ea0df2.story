Birmingham council could rename the city's airport in honour of local lad and heavy metal star Ozzy Osborne

Birmingham Airport could undergo a heavy metal-style makeover as plans have been aired to rename it after Ozzy Osborne.

The city is considering following in the footsteps of others such as Liverpool and New York and renaming their airport in honour of the Black Sabbath frontman.

Jim Simpson, who discovered the band, said there would be no better Brummie to inspire visitors than Osborne.

'I believe it would be a masterstroke that would instantly confound the cynics.

'How does the Ozzy Osborne International Airport resonate? The message says, 'Hey world, we are proud of our own'.

'Ozzy might not always have been a paragon of virtue, but he is a genuine, flesh and blood Brummie.'

Councillor Philip Parkin told the Birmingham Mail talks have taken place to honour Black Sabbath.

Asked about the suggestion that the 
airport could be renamed after Ozzy Osborne.

He said: 'It’s an 
interesting idea and I’ve got an open mind but I think something like 
that would need to be consulted on fairly widely because it’s a 
significant part of our infrastructure.

'I would be interested to know what people thought about that as an idea.

'I still feel in general we need to be making the most of the talent we have got and did have in this city and with something like this we have to ask people their opinion.'

Passengers could soon be arriving at the Ozzy Osborne International Airport in Birmingham

Ozzy Osborne formed Black Sabbath with school friends Geezer Butler, Tony Iommi and Bill Ward who were all from the Aston area of Birmingham. 

Other airports named after home-grown heroes include George Belfast City Airport, Bob Hope Airport in Burbank, California and Leonardo da Vinco Flumicino in Rome.
