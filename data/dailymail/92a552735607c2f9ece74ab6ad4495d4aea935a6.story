He's at it again!

Daredevil Alain Robert, who is known as 'The French Spiderman,' due to his extreme climbs, has taken on the tallest Russian building outside of Moscow.

The 52-year-old successfully scaled the Vysotsky skyscraper in Yekaterinburg, to add to the exhaustive list of the world's tallest buildings he has climbed.

Press and spectators looked on as the Frenchman prepared his safety gear, starting the climb from ground zero of the 188.3-metre-tall structure.

Brave: Alain Robert uses minimal safety equipment when he takes on some of the world's tallest buildings

Taking two-and-a-half hours to climb 52 floors, Robert conducted the final stages of his climb without safety equipment. 

His exploits consistently attract crowds of onlookers who stop to watch him climb. 

As a consequence, Robert has been arrested many times, in various countries, by law enforcement officials waiting for him at the end of his climb - however this time it was very much a 'legal climb.'

Take a break: Workers took pictures and offered support for the French dangerman

Scaling: A couple of bits of rope and some suction cups is all the 52-year-old requires

Robert has climbed landmarks including the Eiffel Tower, the Sydney Opera House and the Montparnasse Tower as well as the world's tallest skyscrapers. 

In 1997 he climbed the Petronas Twin Towers in Kuala Lumpur, Malaysia but was arrested at the 60th floor, 28 floors below the top.

The tallest building the Frenchman has climbed is the Burj Khalifa in Dubai, at a height of 828 metres.
