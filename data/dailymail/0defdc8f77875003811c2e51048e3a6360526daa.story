These are the pictures which prosecutors say prove an alleged al Qaeda operative accused of planning a series of bombings was scouting locations to mount an atrocity. 

A court in New York has released the photographs - taken around the city center of Manchester, England - which form part of the evidence against Abid Naseer.

The 28-year-old Pakistani student was extradited from Britain to stand trial in the U.S. over charges of planning multiple attacks in Europe and America. If convicted, he faces life in prison.

Naseer is accused of leading an al Qaeda cell that was planning to bomb Manchester’s Arndale shopping centre over the Easter weekend in 2009 – as well as a separate plot to attack the New York subway.

Photographs submitted by the prosecution and released by a New York court today show his friend Tariq ur-Rehman at dozens of locations around Manchester - they were recovered from Mr Rehman’s mobile phone and a USB flash drive

He never faced charges in the UK and the evidence against him has only emerged six years after his arrest.

Naseer is alleged to have been at the helm of a British Al-Qaeda terror cell that was part of a broader conspiracy 'to repeat the devastation of 9/11'.

Prosecutors called it one of the most serious terror plots since the 9/11 attacks on New York and Washington.

As well as blowing up the Arndale Centre, the terror group planned to set off bombs in the New York subway and at the offices of a Copenhagen newspaper that had published cartoons of the Prophet Mohammed, it is alleged.

Naseer, a former student in the UK studying English and computer science, denies the charges.

He is being tried in the United States because of the supposed link to the subway.

He never faced charges in the UK and the evidence against him has only emerged six years after his arrest

They include him at Manchester’s Trafford Centre, Cathedral Gardens, Piccadilly Gardens and the Arndale Centre in 2007 and 2008.

Two further sets taken nine days apart in August 2008 show him only in and around the Arndale Centre, a fact the prosecution alleges shows the cell closing in on their final target.

They included pictures of him outside several retail stores, including a branch of Primark and the glass frontage of the centre’s flagship Next store.

Robert Dyson, who works as a crime reduction officer for CityCo in Manchester, advising businesses, was asked by the prosecution to examine the photos.

'They appear to be at all exit points to the building,' he said on Monday. 'They are main exit points.'

Naseer and Rehman were both arrested in April 2009 with eight other Pakistani men studying in the UK. 

No explosives were found at their home and they never faced charges in the UK.

Naseer was extradited to face trial in the U.S. in 2013.

The prosecution alleges they were part of a global Al-Qaeda conspiracy to use operatives with visas or passports allowing them access to Western countries. 

Naseer is accused of using email to stay in touch with an Al-Qaeda commander in Pakistan as they planned their attack.

In particular, the court has been shown an email he sent to his alleged handler saying he had set a date for a nikah - or Muslim marriage ceremony - for the Easter weekend, in what the prosecution believes was Al-Qaeda code for a bombing.

Giving evidence on Thursday, Naseer insisted he had never used any codes or knowingly been in touch with Al-Qaeda members.

Instead he said he had come into contact with the suspect user when posing as a woman online to chat with other women.

'The messages were of an innocent nature, asking about the welfare of the individual, conditions of the weather,' he said, adding that he went on to brag about the number of women he knew and his plans for a wedding once he became aware the recipient was a man.

James Neuman, for the defence, said: 'Did you ever send a coded message?'

Naseer replied: 'I did not send him any coded message.'

He has also denied knowing any members of Al-Qaeda or ever being asked to buy materials for an explosive device.

'Killing innocent people is incompatible with Islam,' he said.

Earlier this week the court heard from five disguised MI5 surveillance operatives who described Naseer’s movements around Manchester and Liverpool in the month leading up to his arrest.

The case continues.
