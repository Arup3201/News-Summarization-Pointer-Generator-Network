Louis van Gaal has exerted his famous authority at Manchester United already by obtaining assurances that the club do not embark on another big pre-season tour next summer.

The new United manager spoke in California ahead of the opening US tour game against LA Galaxy at the Pasadena Rose Bowl.

And it soon became clear that the Dutch coach does not consider these tours adequate preparation for the Barclays Premier League season.

Asked if 
commercial obligations could impinge on the football at United, Van Gaal
 said: 'More or less. We have to prepare the season and when you have 
commercial activities and dreadful distances, having to fly a lot and 
the jet lag, it is not very positive for a good preparation.

'The
 tour was already arranged and I shall adapt and United will do 
everything to apply to my rules, but I have said that already.'

Van
 Gaal hinted at issues with the commercial activity that is part of life
 at Old Trafford when he spoke to the media in England last week.

Chief
 executive Ed Woodward has since played that down but Van Gaal has now 
returned to the theme, suggesting that next summer things will be 
different.

'Yes, I hope that (it will be shorter),' he added.

'But the club have already said that to me and I am very confident that it shall be.'

Van
 Gaal’s comments will certainly be viewed with interest by the United 
board given that it is the club’s vast commercial reach that has 
sustained it through the controversial years of Glazer ownership.

The
 current tour isn’t even that big by United’s standards. Last summer, 
for example, United were away for three weeks and flew vast distances 
between England, Thailand, Australia, Japan and Hong Kong.

During
 this morning’s press conference at a stadium it took Van Gaal and his 
players two hours to reach from their hotel in Los Angeles, the 
62-year-old gave firm backing to the players he has inherited from David
 Moyes and insisted he will not buy anyone else until he has assessed 
his squad properly.

He added: 'At this moment, I cannot say anything about the squad and additions.

'I want to learn about my players and get to know them. When I am the 
coach and when I give the orders to my players to play a certain way, I 
want to see how they perform.

'That is why I cannot answer this question just now. I want to give all
 players the chance to show themselves under my guidance.

'I have to say that the players’ response to me so far has been 
fantastic. Maybe you think every trainer coach will say that when they 
are new, but I mean it.

'The players are very anxious to do what I say and follow the instructions of my assistants.

'The focus of what I have seen in training sessions is top level, but we have to see if the performances are also top level.'
