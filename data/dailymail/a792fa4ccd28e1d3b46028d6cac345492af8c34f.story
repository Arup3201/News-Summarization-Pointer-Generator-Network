It's not often that the wine makers of Champagne are left feeling a little bit flat.

But vineyards across the north of England are toasting extraordinary success - as climate change makes the region ideal for wine-making.

Just over 25 years ago, Renishaw Hall, near Sheffield, was the most northern vineyard in the world.

Yet as they celebrate their 40th anniversary this year they are planning to double the number of white wines they produce from 3,000 to up to 6,000 per year.

Vineyards across the north of England have seen demand soar as the quality of their grapes improves - and they are giving their more illustrious French rivals a run for their money in the sparkling wine stakes.

As temperatures increase because of climate change, grapes become more acidic.

But unlike in Champagne, northern France, it is not too hot in northern England.

Improved trellis systems and management techniques have also helped British manufacturers close the gap on their continental rivals.

Even in Doncaster, South Yorkshire, vineyards have been able to produce wine with 12 per cent natural alcohol.

The Summerhouse vineyard on the outskirts of the northern town started production in 2005 and has rapidly seen its output increase.

But despite their growing success, their are still only a small number of northern vineyards spread across Yorkshire, Lancashire and Derbyshire.

Across England, winemakers have seen demand soar in recent years - although until now it has largely been manufacturers in the south getting all the accolades.

Last year, two English rosés, produced just a few miles from the M25 in Surrey and Kent, scooped top international awards at the wine world's 'Oscars', proving the nation does not need Mediterranean heat to turn out a top tipple.

Kent-based Chapel Down, the winemaker which provided white wine for Prince William's wedding to Kate Middleton, picked up a gold medal for its sparkling Vintage Rosé Brut at the International Wine Challenge, the world's biggest and most important wine competition.

And just a few miles down the road, Denbies Chalk Ridge Rose 2010, produced on the hillsides of Dorking, Surrey, beat off stiff competition from more than 360 producers from 21 countries across the globe to win the still rosé gold medal prize.

Kieron Atkinson, who runs the English Wine Project, told The Times that northern winemakers are giving Champagne a run for their money.

'We are cooler than Champagne, which means we have nicer levels of acid in our grapes. That makes for a better sparkling wine,' he said.

'We are still relatively young at doing this in comparison with the Champagne region but our techniques are catching up, hence our ability to get better and better wine every year.'

He added: 'I guess the alarm bells for the Champagne region are ringing because the summers are so much hotter.'
