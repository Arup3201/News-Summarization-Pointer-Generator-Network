Thiago Silva claims ‘a coward’s tackle’ on Neymar could ruin Brazil’s chances of winning a sixth World Cup in the Maracana on Sunday.

Neymar is out of Tuesday’s semi-final against Germany in Belo Horizonte after he was kneed in the back by Colombia defender Juan Zuniga during Brazil’s 2-1 win.

The Barcelona forward fractured his vertebrae in the incident and will not be able to attend the clash in the Estadio Mineairo.

Attack: Thiago Silva referred to Colombian Juan Zuniga's challenge on Neymar as a 'coward's tackle'

Critical: Brazil captain Silva thinks the tackle on Neymar was unacceptable for the World Cup

Silva, who is also out of Tuesday's match through suspension, said: 'It was a coward’s tackle - some people say it was normal, but I don’t think it was...

'That kind of challenge isn’t done. You can’t get the ball from someone by putting your knee into a player’s back, it’s not normal. But there you are.’

FIFA confirmed on Monday that no disciplinary action would be taken against Zuniga, who has received a flurry of abuse for causing the injury even though he has made two public apologies.

World football's governing body also confirmed on the eve of the Germany game that Silva's appeal against his second yellow card of the tournament, which came when he blocked Colombia goalkeeper David Ospina, had failed.

'I was trying to avoid making fouls against Colombia. I think it was the only one I committed in the match, so it's difficult not being in this game and I'll suffer,' the Paris St Germain defender said.

'It'll be tough but I don't think my mission is complete in this World Cup.

'It's made the group more united, the fact that Neymar and I can't play. It strengthens the group immensely.'

Silva, who will be replaced by Bayern Munich defender Dante for the clash, also revealed that Brazil’s visits to psychologist Regina Brandao have settled their nerves.

He added: ‘The first sign was the ball hitting the post in the second half against Chile.

‘After that moment I heard many people say that, if the ball didn’t go in then, it wouldn’t go in again. Even Julio Cesar said that was a great sign. He thought he'd hold three penalty kicks if it came to it.

‘Regina tries to make us at ease. It’s not just about Neymar. We just talk about a lot of things – Neymar being one of them – but she emphasised we all have to feel at ease. Neymar has already done what he had to do.

'Now it’s up to the other 22 to go out there and do everything for victory. He wanted to be here.’
