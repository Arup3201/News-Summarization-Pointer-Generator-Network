Sometimes love, love, love, love is all you need.

And that's especially true if you are Mark and Rebecca Wright, a Merseyside-based pair of sixties superfans who have said 'love, love me do' at a unique, Beatles-themed wedding in Dorset.

And it's only fitting, since their first date back in 2006 was a Beatles tour of Liverpool.

Primary school teacher Rebecca Mowles, 31, and social worker Mark Wright, 29, chose to mark their shared love for the Fab Four with a colourful wedding ceremony.

And all of their guests had to adhere to the psychedelic sixties dress code.

Mark, his best man and his two ushers donned custom-made colourful suits to replicate the cover of the group's 1967 Sergeant Pepper album - with Mark himself opting for blue silk suit in the guise of Sir Paul McCartney.

Best
man Ant Miller turned up as Ringo Star - appropriate, since he had the rings - while Nick 
Smith came as John Lennon and Robert Pattinson was George Harrison.

Other male guests arrived at Bennetts Water Gardens in Weymouth wearing classic grey suits harking back to the Beatles' early days.

'Fifth Beatle' after scoring two goals in a European Cup quarter-final 
match 1966.

The rest of the congregation wore psychedelic sixties 
costumes and were directed to tables named after the band's albums, such as Let it 
Be and Rubber Soul.Â 

The wedding party later tucked into 
an Abbey Road-themed wedding cake - based on the iconic album cover 
photograph of John, Paul, George and Ringo walking over the zebra 
crossing in the northwest London street.

Later, the groom and his ushers performed Beatles covers, and the wedding party danced to the Liverpudlian band's famous songs.

Appropriately, Rebecca and Mark, who are from the Wirral, spent their first date in 2006 on a Beatles tour of Liverpool, which saw them visiting landmarks including Penny Lane.

It was this that inspired them to say 'I do' surrounded by friends and family wearing wigs and luminous colours.

Rebecca said: 'Our wedding had a sixties theme with a strong Beatles focus. It
was a joint decision, we had been to weddings before and they were all 
very serious and I felt quite uncomfortable and I didn't want to feel 
like that on our day.

'I wanted a relaxed atmosphere, and 
we both love the Beatles, so it made sense, and our first date was 
Beatles-themed. It was a common interest and something we both liked and
it brought us together.'

Mark and Rebecca's wedding cake was based on the Beatle's 1969 album Abbey Road, which features the iconic shot of the Fab Four walking over a northwest London zebra crossing

Rebecca explained: 'When I first met up with Mark in Liverpool we went on a trip to find all the Beatles places, like Penny Lane.

'So
Mark and his three friends dressed up in the Sergeant Pepper Beatles 
outfits, and then four of our friends dressed up in their earlier 
costumes of grey suits and wigs.'

She added: We had all of our tables named after Beatles' albums and we had a band that played some of their hits.

'Everyone made a huge effort and was dressed up - it was fantastic and brilliant fun.'

'When
the guests were coming in we had 60s music playing, and I had eight 
bridesmaids which I requested to wear go-go outfits: short, really 
bright dresses. I thought it would be dodgy but they were all fine about it.

'Some
of the guests went to fancy dress shops and made a huge effort - 
everyone was dressed up. It was absolutely fantastic and brilliant fun.'

Mark said: 'It was the best day of my life - it was so 
relaxed and really specific to what we wanted, we were really pleased. It
was great seeing everyone dressed up in costumes that were almost icons
of the 60s, such as my friend who came as George Best.'
