He told German newspaper Ruhr Nachrichten: 'It was the wrong day and the wrong opponent for us in Liverpool.

'The first two goals we conceded, we didn't defend well. If you make mistakes like those we made, then you will lose against an opponent like Liverpool.

'Our preparation has thus far been relatively unproblematic. From now on we will rest for the DFL-Supercup. The rhythm will come, then the freshness will return too.'

Dortmund face domestic champions Bayern at their ownground, Signal Iduna Park, on Wednesday before opening their league campaign against Bayer Leverkusen on August 22.
