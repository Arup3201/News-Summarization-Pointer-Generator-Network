The BBC was forced to broadcast another grovelling apology for Newsnight yesterday after a flawed report on Help for Heroes.

The programme, which accused the military charity of misspending its cash, was made by the same journalist and group of researchers responsible for Newsnight’s disastrous ‘investigation’ three months later which falsely accused Lord McAlpine of being a paedophile.

That slur cost the BBC £185,000 in damages to the peer and almost brought down the corporation’s flagship TV news programme.

The BBC's editorial complaints unit said the report, by Angus Stickler (pictured), was 'misleading' and 'unfair'

Last night Help for Heroes accused 
the reporter responsible for the Newsnight attack on the charity, Angus 
Stickler, and the Bureau of Investigative Journalism – with whom he 
worked – of ‘shoddy journalism’.

Mr Stickler resigned as chief 
reporter of the now-discredited BIJ after the McAlpine scandal last 
November implicating the former Tory Party treasurer in child abuse 
claims.

The BBC has now admitted that Mr 
Stickler and the BIJ’s programme about Help for Heroes was ‘misleading’ 
and ‘unfair’ to the charity and the programme misrepresented the views 
of Diane Dernie, the mother of badly wounded soldier Ben Parkinson.

The Newsnight report screened last 
August accused the charity – which was founded in 2007 and has raised 
more than £150million – of being ‘too cosy’ with the Ministry of Defence
and subsidising Government rehabilitation buildings rather than 
spending on everyday care for veterans.

Help for Heroes co-founder Bryn Parry was interviewed on the programme, broadcast on August 9, 2012

Former Army chief Lord Dannatt led a 
barrage of criticism of the programme, saying the use of servicemen 
quoted in the report was ‘a tragic abuse of them and a tragic abuse of 
the truth’.

He also raised fears that Newsnight 
may have ‘seriously prejudiced’ the charity’s efforts to raise another 
£63million for the recovery centres vital to helping wounded service 
personnel.

The charity’s co-founder and chief 
executive, Bryn Parry, formally complained to the BBC, which insisted 
days after the broadcast: ‘We stand by the programme and the high 
quality of our journalism.’

Help for Heroes reluctantly decided 
to take no further action at the time because it felt such a move would 
distract from its principal task of helping wounded servicemen.

But when the McAlpine programme hit 
the headlines in November – when Newsnight was already under fire for 
dropping a report into disgraced DJ Jimmy Savile’s years of sex crimes –
the charity realised the same journalist and research team were 
involved, and asked the BBC to examine its complaint again.

The corporation said yesterday: 
‘Following an investigation by its Editorial Complaints Unit, the BBC 
now accepts that its coverage was misleading and unfair to Help for 
Heroes.

‘The BBC gave the impression that 
Help for Heroes was responsible for shortcomings in the provision of 
support to wounded veterans.

'The Editorial Complaints Unit found no 
evidence to support this suggestion.

‘Although it was legitimate to report
the concerns of veterans, the BBC portrayed criticisms about overall 
support by a number of agencies as specific criticisms of Help for 
Heroes.

'This unfair impression was reinforced by our coverage of the 
story in other outlets.

‘In addition, the Newsnight report 
contained interviews with two contributors which were edited in a way 
which misrepresented their views.’

Mr Parry said: ‘My issue has not been
with the BBC, my issue has been with Angus Stickler and the Bureau of 
Investigative Journalism and what I feel was shoddy journalism.

‘The Newsnight report was a complete 
shock to us, but an even bigger shock to the men and women we’re helping
to recover. The BIJ should now apologise.’

Mr Stickler said he stood by the 
story ‘100 per cent’ and claimed the BBC investigation ‘failed to fully 
and properly reflect the evidence put before it’.
