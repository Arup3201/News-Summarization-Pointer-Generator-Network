These extraordinary images by the world’s first rock-climbing photographers show the pioneers of the sport scaling some of Britain’s highest peaks - with their bare hands.

The death-defying pictures were taken in the early 1900s - long before the days of Gore-Tex, safety ropes, protective clothing, spikes, clips and high-strength Kevlar cables.

Pictured on some of the UK’s tallest summits the images show early rock climbers relying on heavy ropes and sheer guts to take on the massive peaks.

Extraordinary: Images from the 1900s show British climbers scaling some of Britain's highest peaks with their bare hands and no protective equipment

A pair of climbers published their remarkable images in several volumes, including ‘Rock Climbing in North Wales’, 1906, and ‘Rock Climbing in Skye’, 1908 (pictured, left)

The daredevils had no protective clothing other than woolly socks and flat caps - forming human chains to haul themselves over rocks and ridges.

Rock climbing first took hold in the Lake District in the 1880s, when early climbers would use wooden poles.

By the late 19th century basic safety equipment included heavy, thick ropes, though the groundbreaking carabiner clip was not invented until 1911.

Climbers in the 1900s

Two of the earliest recognised climbers, George and Ashley Abraham, took heavy camera equipment with them so they could document their adventures.

They published their remarkable images in several volumes, including ‘Rock Climbing in North Wales’ (1906) and ‘Rock Climbing in Skye’ (1908).

A copy of each is set to go under the hammer at Dominic Winter Auctioneers in Cirencester, Gloucestershire, on January 29, where they are expected to make about £200 apiece.

Some pages are missing from books because rock climbers 'would often rip out pages to carry around in their back packs as they tried to emulate some of the climbs'

'Tricky': Climbers George and Ashley Abraham, who took the photos, encapsulated the dangers and difficulties in photographing rock climbers at the time

Auctioneer Chris Albury said: 'They were recognised photographers encapsulating the dangers and difficulties in photographing rock climbers at the time.

'The pictures show they have very limited climbing equipment and taking the photographs would have been tricky with their heavy cameras.

'It’s not uncommon to find pages missing from books such as thee as rock climbers would often rip out pages to carry around in their back packs as they tried to emulate some of the climbs.'
