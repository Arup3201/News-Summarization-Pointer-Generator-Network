England rugby head coach Stuart Lancaster says, by his own performance-clock measurement, that the team have made just 15 minutes’ progress over the last year, despite Saturday’s victory over Australia.

Lancaster uses the clock to gauge where his team are — from the six o’clock nadir of England’s woeful performance on and off the field in New Zealand in 2011, when the two hands were as far apart as they can be, to the perfect alignment of noon, where he wants to be for the 2015 World Cup on home soil.

Lancaster judged England to be at 10pm after the autumn series in 2013 and disappointingly his watch has only moved on to 10.15pm, so the clock is ticking if they are to improve enough before the big kick-off at Twickenham on September 18.

However, Lancaster is lucky in having the full support of the RFU, who would still have backed him if England had lost to Australia.

Chief executive Ian Ritchie said before the match he had every confidence in Lancaster and his staff justifying their extended six-year contracts — awarded in October — even if they suffered another blow in the autumn series.

Understandably, Lancaster said he would have preferred a different order of games during November, rather than starting with the All Blacks followed by South Africa.

But despite his long RFU deal, Lancaster will have no say in the autumn fixtures arranged up to 2019.

England legend Jonny Wilkinson chats with Will Greenwood as a pundit before the Australia Test on Saturday

Jonny Wilkinson will be inundated with offers ahead of the 2015 World Cup and has already been in talks with rights-holders ITV about a pundit role.

Meanwhile, Martin Johnson, who has taken almost a full World Cup cycle to recover from the personal trauma of being the team manager during England’s 2011 debacle, is slowly starting to do more rugby-related work, including some for sponsors HSBC. Even a full return to the sport is not being ruled out for the 2003 World Cup-winning captain.

National treasure Clare Balding, in contract talks aimed at cutting her Channel 4 racing commitments, is still expected to present the marquee turf events next year. Yet even super Clare can’t host the Boat Race for the BBC and the Grand National for C4 on April 11.

The North East Sunday League have shown remarkable support for 77-year-old John Cummings, who lost his Northumberland County FA vice-presidency and was banned for four months by the FA for telling female referee Lucy May — fiancee of Premier League official Michael Oliver — a ‘woman’s place is in the kitchen’. Cummings’s wife Joyce has been elected acting secretary to keep the league afloat in John’s absence.

RFU chairman Bill Beaumont’s idea of being controversial is calling it a ‘challenging’ task for England Rugby 2015 to meet their extortionate £80million World Cup guarantee to the International Rugby Board.

Yet Bill surprisingly agreed to meet famous streaker Erica Roe at Twickenham.

Erica made her topless run at half-time during the 1982 England v Australia match while captain Beaumont was giving his half-time talk on the pitch. It prompted scrum-half Steve Smith to quip: ‘Hey Bill, some bird’s just run on with your bum on her chest.’

Erica, who had her photograph taken with Beaumont by the West Gate 32 years after their first Twickenham encounter, was promoting a breast-cancer awareness calendar.

Sam Burgess with girlfriend Phoebe Hooke watching England against Australia at Twickenham on Saturday

England rugby’s great hope Sam Burgess, who made his union debut for Bath on Friday, has embraced his new code to the extent he was at Twickenham early the next day to enjoy the traditional car-park festivities before the Australia game. And all those who know rugby league great Burgess say that he is such a strong character and presence he would give a lift to England’s Six Nations squad even while learning the 15-man code. 

The RFU’s obsession with milking Twickenham matches for all they are worth now extends to sending sales reps around all the hospitality boxes to sell merchandise to those who haven’t been to the superstore.
