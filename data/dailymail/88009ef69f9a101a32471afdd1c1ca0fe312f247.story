Sportsmail's Jonathan McEvoy exclusively revealed the news on Wednesday that Jenson Button is staying at McLaren

Jenson Button insists his heart has 'always been at McLaren' after it was confirmed that he will join up with Fernando Alonso in what they hope will be era of domination in Formula One.

As first revealed by Sportsmail's Jonathan McEvoy, Button has been handed a remarkable reprieve after he was widely expected to end his career in the sport.

The 34-year-old only signed a contract to remain at the British team on Wednesday night after months of speculation about his future.

But Button believes he and fellow former world champion Alonso, who left Ferrari after a disappointing season, can now bring the good times back at McLaren, under new engine suppliers in Honda.

The British driver had strongly hinted at pursuing life outside of the sport, though he now seems excited at the prospect of leading Ron Dennis' new line-up for 'many years to come'.

'I thought about life outside of Formula 1 but it's nowhere near as fun as inside of it,' Button said at McLaren's HQ at a media event on Thursday. 'My heart has always been with racing with McLaren and Honda.'

'Sometimes the best things in life are worth waiting for! This is a really, really exciting challenge. To race alongside this guy [Alonso] really does mean a lot to me.'

Earlier in the day, Button comically tweeted 'just woken up, what's going on??' after the confirmation.

New team-mate Alonso also took to social media, posting a picture next to a an old McLaren F1 car with the caption: #thePowerOfDreams.

Kevin Magnussen will remain with the team as test, reserve and third driver and Button, while thrilled to have got the nod, is glad the Dane is staying, too.

'I am very pleased to have been invited to do my bit. In fact, I am absolutely raring to go,' he added. 'I am also very glad that Kevin will remain part of the team. He is a very quick driver and a really nice guy.' 

McLaren group chief executive Ron Dennis, who has been criticised for the protracted nature of the team's selection process, is confident the wait was worth it and they have a duo to be reckoned with. 

'McLaren's policy has always been to assemble the strongest line-up possible, and in Fernando and Jenson I firmly believe that is exactly what we have,' he said.

'For many reasons our negotiations with Jenson took quite a long time, but, now that they have been concluded, we are confident that our collaboration with him will continue to thrive in the future every bit as well as it has in the past.

'Make no mistake about it, Jenson is 100 per cent committed to McLaren-Honda, to Formula 1, and to winning.' 

Button won the world title with Brawn back in 2009 and has been at McLaren since 2010
