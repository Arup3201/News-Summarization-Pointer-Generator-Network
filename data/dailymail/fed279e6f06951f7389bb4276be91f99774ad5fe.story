'Could be modernised': Lord Hall, the BBC Director General, said that £145.50 fee could be changed to account for using the iPlayer

Viewers who avoid the licence fee by only watching catch-up shows on iPlayer could have to pay up, the BBC’s director general warned yesterday.

Lord Hall’s comments come amid growing concerns that younger viewers are using free catch-up services to dodge the £145.50 annual charge. He insisted that the licence fee has ‘plenty of life yet’ but admitted it could be changed.

Currently, a loophole means viewers who only watch catch-up shows instead of on TV as they are broadcast do not have to pay the licence fee.

Lord Hall said: ‘It could be modernised again so it applies to watching BBC programmes both live and on iPlayer. This is for the Government to decide, but worth considering.’

In June, the Daily Mail revealed that 463,846 people avoided buying a TV licence by declaring they had not owned a set or watched live shows in the past year.

According to recent figures from media regulator Ofcom, growing numbers of young people watch TV online, on devices such as tablets, smartphones and laptops, rather than on traditional sets.

Those aged 16 to 24 spend just half their viewing time watching shows live as they are screened.

The rest of the time they use free catch-up services such as BBC iPlayer as well as DVDs, recorded TV shows or films, and programmes they have bought and downloaded from the internet.

The trend has piled pressure on the BBC to extend the TV licence to cover all viewers.

There is concern that older watchers are effectively being penalised for watching on TV sets rather than on computers and other devices.

However, Lord Hall downplayed concerns that the loophole could threaten the Corporation’s funding, saying the vast majority of viewers still watch live TV.

Writing in the Daily Mirror, he said: ‘The other charge people make is that the licence fee must be broken because technology is moving so quickly.

Live and kicking: Lord Hall said events such as England's World Cup game against Italy still draw millions of live viewers

‘Why pay the fee when you can watch everything on iPlayer? Whilst we now have a huge choice of programmes to watch on catch-up, close to 90 per cent of all TV viewing is still live.

‘When England played Italy in the World Cup, more than 15million people watched at nearly midnight because they wanted to share the experience. Fewer than 2 per cent of households only watch on-demand programmes and this is growing only slowly.’

A change to the licence could be made when the BBC charter is renewed in 2017. An option is for viewers to enter a code on the iPlayer website before catching up on shows to show they have paid.

British television is being bought wholesale by rich American corporations, Channel 4’s chief executive warned last night.

David Abraham said internet giants such as Netflix and Google could invest here to cut their domestic tax bills and be making our favourite shows in the future.

US giant Viacom now owns Channel 5 and Liberty Global has a 6.4 per cent stake in ITV.

Unrepentant: Jeremy Clarkson stands by his language

Jeremy Clarkson remains unrepentant for sparking a series of race rows, the BBC’s television chief has revealed.

The Top Gear presenter still ‘doesn’t see the problem’ with using words like ‘n*****’ and ‘slope’ despite the public outrage they caused, director of television Danny Cohen said.

Mr Cohen declined to say whether Clarkson would be fired, but said he found his behaviour ‘entirely unacceptable’, adding: ‘No one show or person is bigger than the BBC.’

Speaking at the Edinburgh International Television Festival, he said: ‘I was very, very clear in public and in private with Jeremy I was incredibly unhappy with his language.

‘Jeremy knows that that’s my position and that that’s going to impact on the way the show is thought about in future. People have different views on Jeremy Clarkson. Obviously loads of people think that me being so angry about it is an overreaction. I don’t think it was an overreaction.

‘He disagrees. He doesn’t see the problem with some of the language he used.’

Clarkson, 54, escaped the sack in May despite being forced to apologise for apparently using the word ‘n*****’ during a Top Gear outtake.

Clarkson initially denied he used the word, but later issued a humiliating video message in which he said he was ‘mortified’ by the upset he had caused, and ‘begged forgiveness’ of his fans.

It followed a racist joke made by the £1million-a-year host in an episode which screened in March, involving the term ‘slope’.

Asked if the hit BBC2 show and its lead presenter were ‘untouchable’, Mr Cohen said: ‘It is like football, no one is bigger than the club.’
