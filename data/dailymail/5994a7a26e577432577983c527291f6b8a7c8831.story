Immigration minister Scott Morrison said the four brothers who slipped out of the country to join the fight with the Islamic State in the Middle East are now enemies of Australia.

The western Sydney siblings - aged 17, 23, 25 and 28 made their way to Syria after they told their parents they won a trip to Thailand when they left the country in late October.

But authorities tracked them down in Turkey after being alerted by concerned family members last Saturday when the men failed to contact home.

It is thought that the four have since crossed the Syrian border to fight with IS militants.

More Australians have slipped through the cracks and fled overseas to join the fight with Islamic State

Family friend Dr Jamal Rifi has spoken on behalf of the family, saying: 'We are all not coping. These are Australian boys – we are losing them as they going where they’re not suppose to be [sic]'.

Their mother has pleaded for the safe return of her four sons after she sent them off at Sydney Airport but when the boys arrived in Bangkok, they boarded a plane to Turkey, according to 9News.

The family received a text message saying they were on their way to Syria.

A message from their devastated mother – ‘My sons, you are dear to us. I can’t stop crying day and night. You are good at heart. You have done nothing wrong. Come back [sic],' Mr Rifi told 9News. 

It's reported that the family believes the boys had encountered with someone in Sydney and was given the money and contacts to be able to make the trip over.

Scott Morrison said the four brothers will now face the consequences of their actions 

Mr Morrison said they will now have to face the consequences of their actions.

'Once these young men cross over that line they become enemies of Australia and the world,' he told reporters in Sydney on Saturday.

The brothers' family is reported to be devastated by the news.

'These four young men have effectively been indoctrinated by... a death cult,' the minister said.

Mr Morrison said authorities had received the tip too late to apprehend them.

The siblings were 'clean-skins' and had not been on any watch-lists.

'These were people for whom nothing indicated to date that they might be involved in this type of activity,' Mr Morrison said.

He said it was important the community provided information to authorities.

There are now more than 60 Australians known to be fighting in foreign conflicts.

Authorities argue they need more tools to monitor suspects and prevent them from being radicalised

As authorities attempt to contain home-grown terrorists  from leaving the country, the latest recruits from Western Sydney have been labelled 'cleanskins' by police agencies because they were completely unknown to intelligence.

Australian Federal Police commissioner Neil Gaughan told a parliamentary committee on Thursday that the group of four that managed to leave the country this week were 'not on anyone's radar', the Guardian reported.

'We got wind of it after the fact, but the fact is there are still people travelling,' said Gaughan, the national manager of counter-terrorism for the Australian Federal Police. 1

Authorities were alerted last Saturday when the family contacted a member of a local community after they failed to hear from their boys since they fled the country, the Daily Telegraph reports.

Immigration Minister Scott Morrison confirmed the family was seeking his help but unfortunately, it was too late.

'Australia has lost yet another four young kids. This is why we are so adamant in trying to prevent people leaving to join these foreign fighters', Mr Morrison told The Daily Telegraph.

It follows after 'ginger' jihadist Abdullah Elmir disappeared from his Bankstown home in Sydney's south-west in June and made his way to the Middle East.

The 17-year-old gained notoriety when he declared that ISIS will not stop their murderous campaign 'until the black flag is flying high in every single land' in the YouTube video.

According to The Daily Telegraph, counter terrorism officers have been deployed to all Australian international airports.

This comes just days ahead of the G20 summit to be held in Brisbane, which will be attended by a large number of world leaders. 

Police commissioner Neil Gaughan also told the committee he believed that federal police officers needed greater controls urgently, so they were better able to track the movements and interactions of suspects. 

'But the fact is there’s still people travelling and regardless of what we’re doing, we’re not stopping that so we need some other tools,' he said, according to The Telegraph.

Though he did not reveal from where or to what destination the group travelled, Gaughan said officers are now virtually powerless to stop them unless they resurface elsewhere.

'Unfortunately, once they get into Syria or into Iraq, there is nothing the AFP can do except wait for them to basically pop their head up somewhere on the way back.'

Gaughan was speaking at an investigation into new legislation which aims to give security agencies power to issue control orders on people who are enabling or supporting terrorism.

He also revealed that authorities were struggling to keep up with the sheer number of people being radicalised in such a short time - often less than six months.

Authorities said the ability to put restrictions on who suspects can communicate with and where they can go would allow them to greatly reduce the change of an attack on home soil.
