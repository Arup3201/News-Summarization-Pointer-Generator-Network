The father of a severely disabled 22-year-old woman is fighting a legal battle to keep her in school after a council insisted she was no longer entitled to publicly-funded education.

Anthony Williams wants his daughter Maria, who suffers from Down's syndrome, to continue studying at Columbus College, Chelmsford, until she is 25.

But Essex County Council say she was no longer entitled to publicly-funded education once she reached the age of 19.

Appeal hearing: The Royal Courts of Justice in London where Anthony Williams is fighting a legal battle to keep his disabled daughter in school

The battle has been taken to the Court of Appeal where senior judges will decide on the woman's future.

It is seen as a vital test case which could see thousands of adults with learning difficulties continuing into state-funded education and sharing classrooms with children, costing local councils millions.

The court heard that Miss Williams, who is from Chelmsford, entered mainstream education when she was five but was always one year behind her peers and was transferred to the specialist Columbus College in 2006.

She has a reading age of nine, cannot tell the time and has no concept of money, but she loves drama, dance and the expressive arts.

She continues to study at the college, which, with the approval of her father, is happy for her to stay on until she is 25, the court heard.

But, since 2008, the council has insisted her Statement of Special Education Needs only ran until she was 19, after which she would not be entitled to publicly-funded education.

Following a long-running legal wrangle with her father, the council has now brought the case before the Court of Appeal, asking three senior judges to rule on the issue.

Decision to make: Lord Justice Maurice Kay is one of the Court of Appeal judges who will make a decision on Maria Williams' future in education

David Wolfe, for Mr Williams, told the court a 'flexible approach' should be taken, which would prevent those who need continuing education 'falling off a cliff when they hit 19'.

He said: 'Although a statement can only be made in the first place for someone who is at the time "a child", statements do not automatically lapse, for example simply because the person ceases to be "a child".' 

Fiona Scolding, for the council, warned judges that allowing students with special educational needs to continue in schools past 19 would have a massive impact on local authorities around the country.

She said: 'There are approximately 223,000 children and young people in  England and Wales with statements of special educational needs.

'This case is about Maria Williams and its facts, but it is applicable to the other young people approaching or having reached 19, who may well wish to stay in school until their late twenties.' 

'It is a point of real importance, as it raises a significant issue of principle as to when a local authority's responsibility ceases for those with statements of special educational needs.

'Local authorities have, to date, considered that their responsibilities end, in line with the code of practice, the year that a child becomes 19.'This also raises questions about the designation of schools and how they would manage to accommodate these individuals, and also practical questions about safeguarding younger children if there are a cohort of adults being taught with them.'

Recognising the widespread importance of the case, Lord Justice Maurice Kay, sitting with Lord Justice Moses and Mrs Justice Baron, reserved their judgement, which will be given at an unspecified date in the future.
