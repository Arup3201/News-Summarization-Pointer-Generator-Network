A New Jersey judge on Wednesday put an end to the drawn-out legal battle between Samantha Perelman, the daughter a cosmetics mogul, and her uncle, ruling that the 24-year-old was not cheated out of a share of her grandfather's fortune.

Ms Perelman, the daughter of billionaire investor Ronald Perelman and the late gossip columnist Claudia Cohen, has accused her uncle of pressuring and manipulating her palsy-stricken grandfather, Robert Cohen, into denying her a portion of his inheritance.

Mr Cohen, the former head of the Hudson News empire, passed away in 2012 leaving a $700million estate, much of which went to his son, James.

'Poor' rich girl: Samantha Perelman, seen here at the 2013 Costume Institute Gala with her billionaire father Ron Perelman, has failed to convince a judge that her uncle had pressured her grandfather to disinherit her 

In a 93-page opinion, New Jersey Superior Court Judge Estela M. De La Cruz wrote that James Cohen, Robert's heir who took over the family business after his death, did not exert 'undue influence' over his ailing father to get him to cut his granddaughter out of his will.

The decision came after a contentious six-month trial during which Samantha Perelman’s legal team called 20 witnesses to the stand in an attempt to prove that her uncle had plotted to disinherit her.

On his part, James Cohen told the court how towards the end of his life, his father suffering from a degenerative nerve and brain disorder that had rendered him speechless was only able to communicate through blinking.

According to Mr Cohen, Robert was angry that his son-in-law, the Revlon tycoon Ronald Perelman, was grasping for his fortune even as he lay dying.

Wednesday's court ruling cost Samantha Perelman about $30million, a corporate jet, a stake in a Palm Beach mansion and her late grandfather's home in New Jersey, the New York Post reported.

‘We are disappointed with the decision, and believe it is not consistent with the intention and wishes of Robert Cohen with respect to his daughter Claudia and his granddaughter Samantha,’ Perelman family spokeswoman Christine Taylor said in a statement to the New York Times.

However, it was not a complete loss for Ms Perelman since Judge De La Cruz ruled that her lawsuit was not frivolous and ordered her uncle to pay her legal fees.

The 24-year-old still has the $67million she inherited from her Page Six columnist mother after her death in 2007.

Samantha also stands to receive a portion of her father's $14million estate in the future. Mr Perelman, 71, has been married five times, most recently in 2010, and has seven children.

And as far as the Perelman camp is 
concerned, it may only be a temporary setback: Samantha’s 
spokesperson stated after the verdict that they are now 'evaluating' their 
legal options. 

On his 
part, James Cohen expressed hope that the ruling would end the war 
within his extended family, which he said made his father's final years 
'a misery.'

Throughout the trial, Mr Cohen's team insisted that the son was always respectful of his father and never tried to sway him.

The
 elder 
Cohen, who died aged 86 after a 13-year battle with a Parkinson's-like 
condition built Hudson News into a retail empire starting with a 
Newark, New Jersey news stand.

After his death two years ago, he left the company to his son James, who then sold it and collected $600million from the deal.

Miss
 Perelman is the daughter of former New York Post's Page Six columnist
 Claudia Cohen, James Cohen's sister, who died in 2007 leaving her child
 a $67million fortune.

Meanwhile,
 her father, Ron Perelman, is worth an estimated $14billion, made 
through leveraged buyouts of companies and his stake in Revlon 
cosmetics.

Robert
 Cohen's decline began in 1999, when the tycoon was 
diagnosed with Parkinson's. In 2004 he was battling liver cancer and 
that year also lost control of his limbs and bodily functions.

By
 2009, the year he wrote his last will naming his son James as sole 
beneficiary, the businessman was so incapacitated that he was unable 
even to blink, Samantha Perelman's lawyer had argued.

A spokesman 
for Miss Perelman previously claimed that she was prevented from seeing her 
ailing grandfather in the final years of his life.

To the victor go the spoils: James Cohen, seen here with his 
wife, spent years battling niece Miss Perelman over millions she accused him of cheated her out of by coercing his late father to change his will

Her lawyer had asked the court to throw out that will and reinstate one 
written in 2004, which had left Claudia Perelman, Miss Perelman's late 
mother, valuables including a 30-carat diamond ring worth $10million and
 his private jet, as well as $25million in cash.

Since Miss Perelman was the main beneficiary of her mother's estate, she had stood to inherit most of that fortune.
