More than three quarters of Brits are booking their flights online, with the majority driven by lower prices.

Some 77 per cent of holidaymakers snub travel agents in favour of buying plane trips on the internet, with 77 per cent of these saying cost is their main priority.

Almost two thirds (63 per cent) favour the 24-hour nature of internet booking, 53 per cent want access to comparison sites and 51 per cent say it's quicker than using an agent, according to a survey.

Online trend: More than three quarters of Brits are booking their flights online

A tech-savvy one in seven of us will make all our travel plans on the move - using a mobile phone to browse, choose and pay for flights.

And for young adults especially, booking via phone is 'the norm', with almost a third (28 per cent) of 18-24-year-olds always using a smartphone to shop for flights while two per cent of those aged 55 and over are giving it a try too.

According to a new One Poll survey commissioned by online travel retailer Bravofly, the majority of us (53 per cent) spend less than 30 minutes making a booking and one in ten (nine per cent) whizzes through the process in just ten minutes.

When it comes to booking flights online, almost two thirds (63 per cent) favour the 24-hour nature of internet booking, 53 per cent want access to comparison sites and 51 per cent say it's quicker than using an agent.

More Brits are sneaking on travel sites to make bookings during work time too.

Almost a third (30 per cent) admitted using the office computer to shop for flights, and 16 per cent made reservations - compared to just ten per cent who wait until their lunch break.

Young people are the most cost-aware with those aged 18-24 choosing flights purely on price - compared to 75 per cent of over 55s.

According to the report, 69 per cent of Brits take five flights a year, with a lucky seven per cent booking up to 25.

As a result, more than a quarter of us has an annual flights budget of £1k, while almost a third (32 per cent) spend £300 and another third splashes out £600. A well-travelled four per cent spends more than £2,000.

A spokesman for Bravofly said: ‘We know that the way we choose and book flights is changing all the time - and the development of mobile-enabled travel services is making a huge impact on consumer habits.

‘What these results demonstrate very clearly is that cost, speed and convenience are everything to modern travellers - whether they're flying for personal or professional reasons.’
