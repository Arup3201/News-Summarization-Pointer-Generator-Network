The New York Red Bulls coach may have been brutally stabbed to death in New York City's Greenwhich Village in a tragic case of mistaken identity, police revealed today.

The announcement from New York Police Commissioner Raymond Kelly comes as photos emerged of Michael Jones, 25, with his girlfriend.

The beloved youth soccer coach from 
Liverpool, England, spoke with Bryeanna Murphy, 23, on the phone just minutes
before he was attacked and his ear savagely hacked off early Sunday.

Devoted: Mike Jones, 25, called his girlfriend Bryeanna Murphy, 23, several times the night he was killed

Long term: Miss Murphy had been dating Mr Jones for about a year

Detectives are looking into a fight earlier in the evening that Mr Jones' suspected killer had over a woman he met in a bar, the New York Post reports.

Police believe Mr Jones had nothing to do with the woman or the fight, but was instead mistaken for the murder suspect's nightclub adversary.

Officers have ruled out robbery, since Mr Jones' wallet and iPhone were still on his body.

Surveillance video shows Mr Jones next to his pony-tailed killer about 4.15am on Sunday on West 14th Street, according to the Post.

The two men appear to exchange words and begin to argue.

The suspect suddenly pushes Mr Jones against a building and pulls out a knife.

He is seen slashing and stabbing the coach six times before leaving him to bleed to death.

A medical examiner ruled he died of stab wound to his chest and stomach, including a puncture in his heart.

The killer, described as a Hispanic man between age 25 and 30, then calmly walks away. The murderer is still at large.

However, police reportedly were interviewing a 'person of interest' in the slaying on Monday.

Minutes before the killing, Mr Jones spoke with Miss Murphy, who had had been dating for about a year.

Mr Jones and his girlfriend spent out together on Saturday night in the East Village visiting a friend's apartment.

He left Miss Murphy about 11.30pm to hit the town at several upscale nightclubs with other friends.

Despite the boy's night out, Mr Jones dutifully called his girlfriend several times throughout the evening -- including just before he was killed.

Miss Murphy lives in Mamaroneck in Westchester County, New York. Mr Jones lived eight miles away in West Harrison, where he coached a youth soccer league for the New York Red Bulls.

'He
coached two of my three sons and was just a great guy. He cared about 
what he did, and was very dedicated,' Mark Fischer, who oversees 
referees in the Westchester league, told the Post. 'The kids loved him.'

'He loved New York and he loved the lifestyle and he was working and hoping to get a visa so he could stay there full time,' the elder Mr Jones said.

He said he and his wife received a Facebook message from one of his son's friends on Sunday telling him to call the NYPD.

When the couple phoned, they found out their promising young son had been brutally murdered.

Mr Jones' body was found at 4:25am, his ear lying a few feet away.

Officers
covered the ear with a plastic cup to hide it from passersby and rushed
the man to Bellevue where he was pronounced dead on arrival.

'It was a frenzy. The guy was chopped multiple times,' a police source told the Post. 'He cut the guy's ear off. It doesn't get any more personal than that.'

In a statement released on Sunday, 
the Red Bulls said: 'We are aware of this tragedy and on behalf of the 
entire organization, want to send our most heartfelt condolences to 
Michael’s family, friends and loved ones.

'He
was a tremendous individual, a fantastic coach who loved soccer and a 
terrific friend for many of us. This is truly a sad day for our soccer 
community and we will do our utmost to help authorities in their 
investigation of this case. Our thoughts and prayers are with Michael's 
family at this time.'

Witness said that Jones, 25, 
who lives in West Harrison, New York but comes from Liverpool England, 
was so mutilated that they believed it was a Halloween prank.

'We thought it was a Halloween joke or something because his phone was 
there, so maybe if we tried to get his phone that he’ll pop up or 
something,' a witness told CBS News York.

Another disturbed witness said: 'I never, ever, ever seen nothing like this. Ever.'
