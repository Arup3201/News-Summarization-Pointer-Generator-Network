Receiving an insulting letter on Valentine's Day could be enough to dent any young lady's confidence.

Brittany Molina, a 21-year-old student at Brigham Young University, was handed an anonymous letter last week by a young man at her college, telling her that her dress sense 'had a negative effect' on those around her.

Miss Molina then posted the handwritten note and picture of the outfit she was wearing at the time - a modest ensemble of a knee-length dress and leggings - on Twitter. Since the nasty note went viral, she has received flowers, chocolates and anonymous love notes...along with a modelling job.

Designer Cris Pulsipher, co-owner of Cris & Kate’s clothing line, told MailOnline: 'Brittany had been through a discouraging time after receiving that note and we wanted to turn a negative into a positive, so we got in touch with her.

'She is such a humble and positive person. We thought Brittany was perfect for what our brand stands for - being able to dress well, not feel anxious about what you are wearing and be comfortable in clothes all day.'

Ms Pulsipher runs the clothing line with business partner Kate Erwin which is available in boutiques across Utah. 

Miss Molina, originally from Oregon, told the Salt Lake Tribune: 'I got some cute clothes, and 
they’re really nice ladies. I was trying to help them out - 
promote their business.'

On Valentine's Day, the accountancy student had been walking through the halls of her college when a male student dashed up and handed her a note.

She later posted on Twitter: 'So this boy came up to me... I thought he was giving me a love note. Turns out...'

The
 'helpful', handwritten advice reads: 'You may want to consider that what you're 
wearing has a negative effect on men (and women) around you.

'Many
 people come to this university because they feel safe, morally as well 
as physically, here.

'They expect others to abide by the Honor Code that 
we all agreed on.

Happy Valentine's Day: The note was handed to 21-year-old student at BYU which is heavily influenced by Mormonism

'Please consider your commitment to the Honor Code (which you agreed to) when dressing each day. Thank you.'

Miss Molina then tweeted: 'I'll remember to dress in jeans, a sweatshirt and tennis shoes tomorrow. That way I don't make people feel uncomfortable.'

Dozens of the student's followers commented on the derisory 'Valentine', mostly in support of the 21-year-old.

Brigham Young University was founded and continues to be supported by The Church of Jesus Christ of Latter-day Saints.

The college is heavily influenced by 
Mormonism and offers students the opportunity to not only study but to 
focus on their faith.

Students
 must follow on honor code which along with abstaining from alcohol, 
tobacco, coffee and swearing, asks that they follow a dress code.

BYU
 requires that female students don't dress in revealing or form-fitting 
clothing and that skirts are knee-length or longer. Excessive piercings 
and 'extreme' hairstyles are also banned.
