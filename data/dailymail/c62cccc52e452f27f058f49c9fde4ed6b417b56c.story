With his jet black locks, inky eyeliner and multiple tattoos, it's safe to say that 23-year-old Kieran Martin from South Shields is not your average model.

But he - and fellow 'alternative models' - are becoming increasingly popular with magazines and brands who put quirky cool ahead of conventional beauty.

Indeed, so popular has the tattooed and pierced look become, Mr Martin has even launched an alternative modelling competition which scours the country looking for potential new faces.

Entrepreneur: Kieran Martin, 23, is the man behind the UK's biggest alternative modelling competition

'We have had a lot of interest,' he reveals. 'We've had
 over 200 applicants already this year and we're expecting another 250 at our London auditions in July.'

And Mr Martin might find himself with even more than he bargained for, thanks to a new documentary that's set to raise the profile of alternative modelling even more.

Outsiders With Darren McMullen, which will be screened tonight on National Geographic, features last year's competition and focuses on top alternative model, Iska Ithil.

Iska - real name Katherine - boasts rainbow hair, pink eyebrows and multiple piercings, and has appeared in Vogue as well as in a campaign for optical chain, Specsavers.

'I think when you go this far you have to
 make, you have to make sacrifices,' she tells McMullen in the documentary.

'Because how I look is a permanent
 thing, it doesn’t matter like how casual I try and dress - I still stand
 out, and there are  days that you just want to kind of walk down the 
street and just just to blend in.'

But this is one industry where standing out is the name of the game, as Mr Martin explains. 'We look for an alternative style, a good image and plenty of confidence,' he reveals.

Looking good: Most alternative models boast an unusual look, complete with tattoos and numerous piercings

Popular: Many alternative models have body art - something that is requested by many clients

And confidence is something you'll 
certainly find plenty of at Mr Martin's competitions, with many entrants
 saying that modelling has been just what they need to give their self 
esteem a boost.

Among them is Lisa Eagleton, winner of last year's 'Best Look' award, who lost her right leg seven years ago in a car accident and was dumped by her partner shortly afterwards.

'My partner didn't fancy me once I’d lost my leg,' she says. 'So as a result I 
didn’t feel very good as a woman.

'I was on Facebook one night and got 
offered a chance to do a photo shoot to make myself feel better, then I 
continued on to do more, and as a result of doing the modelling, I 
gained more confidence.'

Today, her life has been transformed thanks to her later life career as an alternative model. 'As a mum with four daughters I wanted to show to them that you don’t 
have to be what the media deems to be perfect,' she adds.

Confidence: According to Kieran, the experience of being photographed is a real confidence boost for many

'As long as you’re happy with you and you’re happy with who you are, you can be anything.'

Mr Martin agrees: 'A lot of the entrants were bullied at school and have been quite self-conscious 
about how they look,' he confirms. 'This is a great platform for them to gain 
confidence.'

So what does it take to make it as an alternative model? According to top agent Asha Tank, founder of Dark Arts Alternative Model Agency, the answer is boasting looks that are as striking as possible.

'You need to be different to the norm,' she tells McMullen. 'Not what you’d see on those normal model agency books really - someone you would maybe look twice at in the street and go "ooh that’s unusual". Someone striking, someone edgy.'

You don't, however, need to go on a diet or even check your birth certificate. Unlike mainstream models, alternative models can be all sizes, shapes and ages.

'We let absolutely anyone enter, any size,
 any image,' explains Mr Martin. 'They will be given a fair audition which includes two photo 
shoots and a mini catwalk.

'We don't have any age limit,' he adds. 'We start at
 13 and just go upwards. Our oldest contestants from last year were in their 50s - we 
don't discriminate.'

And for those who do make it, the rewards can be lucrative. 'Our winners earn a contract with The Twisted Agency,' he explains.

'Our 2012 winner, Johnny George, has been on the catwalk,' adds Mr Martin with a satisfied smile. 'I think that the fashion industry is finally
starting to change and accept alternative style.'
