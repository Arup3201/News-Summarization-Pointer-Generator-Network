Britain will be accused by 180 Iraqis next week of breaching international law by torturing and killing prisoners during the controversial Iraq War.

Lawyers representing the group - who claim they are victims of abuse or their family members were unlawfully killed - will accuse the UK of a 'systemic' policy of abuse committed between 2003 and 2008.

The case - which will be heard in the High Court from January 29 - will see British soldiers and intelligence officers accused of unlawful interrogation practices.

Lawyers acting for the group will place a file of statements before two judges which details alleged use of 'stress positions' and  hooding as well as beating, sexual abuse and religious abuse of illegally detained prisoners.

Some of the claims made in the 
statements are incredibly shocking with sexual depravity and insults to 
Islam featuring strongly.

In one case, a soldier is alleged to 
have masturbated over a prisoner while another is alleged to have 
committed sodomy with his finger.

The High Court will also be told how 
female interrogators stripped and feigned seduction in exchange for 
information from prisoners.

Worrying: The death of Baha Mousa, an innocent  hotel worker killed whilst in British custody in Basra in 2003, is just the tip of the iceberg, it will be claimed next week. He is pictured with his family

According to The Observer, the court 
will hear that in some cases, the torture led to the death of a 
prisoner. The claims come just weeks away from the 10th anniversary of the 
war in Iraq.

The court 
will rule on whether the alleged abuses were isolated and were unaware 
to commanders, politicians and senior Ministry of Defence officials or whether they were 
authorised as policy.

The statements from the group which will
 be presented to the court were complied by human rights lawyer Phil 
Shiner, from the Public Interest Lawyers group.

He held meetings with victims and their relatives - mostly in Lebanon - were he heard the allegations of abuse.

The Ministry of Defence has always maintained that issues around interrogation and detention during the Iraq War were dealt with at the inquiry into the death of Baha Mousa, an innocent  hotel worker killed whilst in British custody in Basra in 2003.

The driving forces behind the case at the High Court next week are a human rights lawyer and an author.

The group of Iraqis who make the 
allegations of abuse against British soldiers are represented by human 
rights lawyer Phil Shiner.

He works for the Birmingham-based 
Public Interest Lawyers group and has a reputation for working on issues concerning international, environmental and human rights law.

Mr Shiner has also written numerous articles on international and human rights law.

Much of the evidence which will be heard 
by the High Court next week was taken by him following meetings in the 
Lebanon with the alleged victims and their families.

He has previously accused the 
Ministry of Defence (MoD) of 'deploying every dirty trick in the book' 
to avoid accountability over the treatment of soldiers in Iraq.

Speaking previously, he said: 'There must be a judicial inquiry into the UK's detention policy in south-east Iraq.

'The MoD has deployed every dirty 
trick in the book to prevent accountability for the hundreds of torture 
and unlawful killings cases of Iraqi civilians.'

Mr Shiner also represented the victims in the Baha Mousa Public Inquiries. He was the 'Human Rights Lawyer of the Year' in 2004, as designated by Liberty and Justice.

Andrew Williams, who is the 
author of a book on the death of Baha Mousa, has also been campaigning for 'the truth' into allegations of abuse.

He wrote A Very British Killing: The Death of Baha Mousa which was published in October last year.

A description of the book claims it
 tells the 'inside story' of the death and examines 'institutional 
brutality' and a 'flawed military police inquiry' into the death. His 
book claims that the death of Baha Mousa was not about 'a few bad men' 
or 'rotten apples'.

The High Court hearing is scheduled over three days from January 29.

The MOD also has its own internal probe into alleged abuse through its Iraq Historic Allegations Team.

But Andrew Williams, who is the 
author of a book on the death of Baha Mousa , told The Observer that his
 death was just the tip of the iceberg.

'This
 is the crucial moment of decision', he said. 'This is our last chance 
to get to the truth of what happened. This is what we demand of others, 
but we do not demand it of ourselves.'

The court will be told of five 'state practices' which the lawyers will claim were 'unlawful, right to the top'.

They claim illegal interrogation techniques were taught at Chicksands, near London, which is an army intelligence facility.

Many
 of the alleged incidents happened while prisoners were being held in 
custody, although it will be claimed that some took place at people's 
homes .
