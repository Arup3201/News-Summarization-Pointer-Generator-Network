Scotland and Glasgow fly-half Duncan Weir will miss the RBS Six Nations championship and be sidelined for up to four months after undergoing surgery on his right bicep. 

Weir suffered an injury to his arm during the league clash with Edinburgh on December 27 and a scan showed the 23-year-old would require surgery to fix the problem.

A statement on Glasgow's official website said: 'Following an injury sustained in the game against Edinburgh Rugby at Scotstoun on Saturday 27 December and a subsequent MRI scan at BMI Ross Hall Hospital, it was advised that Duncan Weir required surgery to repair his right biceps.

Duncan Weir kicked a dramatic last-ditch drop goal to secure a 21-20 win over Italy in Rome last season 

'Duncan has successfully undergone surgery and will be out of action for up to four months.'

Weir was Scotland's starting fly-half in the 2014 Six Nations championship and kicked a dramatic last-ditch drop goal to secure a 21-20 win over Italy in Rome.

The Glasgow stand-off also played in the Scotland side that defeated Argentina 21-19 in Cordoba last June, kicking 11 points in the victory, before being on the losing side to South Africa.

Weir was named in Vern Cotter's squad for last year's autumn internationals, although he lost his starting berth to Glasgow team-mate Finn Russell.

Scotland finished fifth in last year's Six Nations tournament thanks to their narrow win over Italy.

Glasgow also announced that loose forward Tyrone Holmes will be out for up to six weeks after he underwent a procedure to repair a fractured eye socket suffered in the game against Edinburgh on January 2.
