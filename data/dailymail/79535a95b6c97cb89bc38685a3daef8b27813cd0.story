Two Czech actors who dressed up as police officers in a candid camera style stunt have been given suspended jail sentences after one of the people they tried to fool collapsed with a heart attack.

And ironically the man who almost died and who was left permanently disabled and in a wheelchair as a result of the prank was being filmed as part of a Czech Television charity project tackling the issues of disability.

The project organisers had hired two well-known Czech actors and dressed them up as disabled policemen who flagged down motorists and told them they were being fined for speeding. One was in a wheelchair while the other used crutches, with the idea being to gauge people's reaction to being stopped for speeding by disabled policeman.

But it backfired when one of the drivers, who was not named in the trial, collapsed with a heart attack when he realised he was being filmed by Czech TV cameras in the stunt in the centre of the capital, Prague, in 2012.

As a result Petr Ctvrtnicek, 50, and Jan Potmesil, 48, ended up in court charged with impersonating police officers after an investigation prompted by a complaint from the man's family.

The District Court in Prague stressed that both actors were not on trial for causing harm to the man but for impersonating police officers, together with the director and the producer of the short clip, which was shown on television, although not including the part where the man collapsed with a heart attack.

However video director Tomas Svoboda and producer Jiri Kounicky were found not guilty because they did not wear police uniforms.

Judge Marketa Binderova said to the pair: 'It needs to be made quite clear why you are here. Impersonating a police officer is a serious offence regardless of how good the intentions.'

The actors however have pleaded not guilty and said that they thought it was obvious, given the bad quality of the uniforms, that it was just a sketch.

The two actors are now considering taking legal action against Czech Television for getting them to break the law. In the latest hearing, the actors through their lawyers, claimed that they had simply 'followed the screenplay and contract as provided by Czech Television'.

But this was rejected by the judge Binderova who said: 'Both of them are mature adults and quite capable of thinking for themselves. They must know what the law is. And they were not forced into doing this.'

But outside the court Petr Ctvrtnicek rejected the judge's remarks saying: 'According to the verdict of the court it now seems that all of my acting colleagues will have to make sure they take a lawyer with them into the dressing room to avoid being prosecuted. If they don't, they could also end up with the same thing happening to them.'

His fellow actor Jan Potmesil however was less combative and reserved his comments to apologise for what happened to the victim. He said: 'I am really sorry about it. I did not expect that there would be someone who wouldn't recognise us.'

Potmesil is a well-known Slovak theatre and film actor, who is himself a disabled man. He became confined to a wheelchair after damaging his spine in a car accident in 1988.
