A Georgia man turned the tables on two security guards when he called 911 on the pair after they allegedly caught him shoplifting Sunday.

The pair of security guards followed Alfonso Aguilar, 42, out of the Buford Walmart after they allegedly caught the man stealing items from the store's counters, AJC reports.

As the guards walked Aguilar back into the store, the man pulled out a knife and began swinging it wildly, trying to slash one of the officers, according to CBS.

Alfonso Aguilar, 42, was arrested after he attacked two Walmart security guards who allegedly caught him stealing because he thought they were 'thugs.'

Dispatcher: Aguilar called 911 and told the dispatcher that he was looking at cell phone accessories in the store when the two men approached and tried to grab him

Aguilar fled and did what most shoplifters wouldn't: he called the police.

Aguilar told the dispatcher that he was looking at cell phone accessories in the store when the two men approached and tried to grab him. 

He said that the men looked like 'two little thug guys' and not security guards, the Daily News reports.

Arrested: Police arrived and arrested Aguilar on charges of aggravated assault and possession of a weapon during the commission of crime

But police say that the guards fully identified themselves when they approached Aguilar and tried to detain him.

'I pulled out my knife because they were grabbing me really firm,' he  told the dispatcher.

Stash: Aguilar ran across the street and stashed the stolen items around a box truck in a Lowe's parking lot

Aguilar then ran across the street and stashed the stolen items around a box truck in a Lowe's parking lot, CBS reports. 

Police arrived and arrested Aguilar  on charges of aggravated assault and possession of a weapon during the commission of crime.
