Role model: Critics say Bear Grylls should not use his position as leader of the scouting movement to push his own products

Bear Grylls has been accused of exploiting his position as Chief Scout to push sales of a range of children's knives.

In a promotional video, the TV adventurer endorses a range of Gerber outdoor kit by mentioning his role as head of the Scout movement.

While he has not broken the law, critics say he has entered a murky area by attempting to cash in on his association with a voluntary organisation.

He is also promoting the range of 'Bear Grylls Scout and Compact Scout Knives' despite the fact that the Scout Association advises that penknives should not be taken on camping trips unless there is a specific need.

In the video, which has been watched online by more than 318,900 people, Grylls says: 'One of the jobs I do is to be Chief Scout and figurehead to 28million scouts worldwide, and it's a post I'm really proud of.

'For me, scouting is all about bringing adventure to young people, and we've developed two knives aimed at scouting.'

He demonstrates how to open and grip the knife, adding: 'You never know when you might need it. Safe scouting, and remember: a knife's a tool – use it responsibly.'

Labour MP Paul Flynn said: 'We would 
expect the figureheads of charitable bodies to be beyond any commercial 
interests.

'There should be a line drawn between the charitable and very 
honourable aims of the scouting movement and any commercial interest.'

Sir Stephen Bubb, chief executive of 
the Association of Chief Executives of Voluntary Organisations, said: 'I
feel certain that Bear Grylls will be wanting to donate any profits he 
makes back to the scouts.

'Many charities and voluntary bodies 
have come to rely on well-known public figures becoming figureheads, and
that relies on the public believing they are giving up their time 
without private profit.'

Grylls, who became Chief Scout in 
2009, said that the organisation was aware of the promotional work. 'I 
am sure being Chief Scout helps TV ratings and sales, so, yes, it does 
benefit me – just as hopefully I benefit them in some small way,' he 
said. 'Hopefully, everyone wins.'

The Scout Association would not say 
whether Grylls had shared any profits from sales of the knives. 'There 
is no restriction on businesses using the word “scout”,' a spokesman 
said.

'Bear is always incredibly generous with giving freely his time, energy and support.'

Last night, Grylls told the Mail: 'I 
take being Chief Scout very seriously and never develop licensees with 
the intent to profit off my position.'
