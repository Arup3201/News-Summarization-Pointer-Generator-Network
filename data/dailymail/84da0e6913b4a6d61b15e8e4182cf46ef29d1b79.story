Canadian police have foiled a deadly plot that would have seen at least two people storm a mall and kill as many victims as possible on Valentine's Day before committing suicide, officials have said.

A 23-year-old US woman, from Geneva, Illinois, a 20-year-old man, from Halifax, and a 17-year-old boy, from Cole Harbour, were reportedly arrested  on Friday morning following a tip-off to police.

Another man, a 19-year-old Canadian, shot himself at his parents' home in Timberlea earlier that day after officers surrounded the property, police said. The suspects are yet to be identified.

In a statement, Nova Scotia Royal Canadian Mounted Police Commanding Officer Brian Brennan said the deceased man and woman had intended to carry out the murderous plot at a Halifax mall.

They had plotted 'to go to a public venue in the Halifax region on February 14th with a goal of opening fire to kill citizens, and then themselves,' he told CBC News on Friday night. 

According to an anonymous senior police official, the pair had been communicating on a chat stream, were obsessed with killing and death and had numerous photos of mass killings.

The alleged roles of the other male suspects are still being determined as part of the investigation.

Officer Brennan said the force had received a tip-off about the woman and the 19-year-old man - who posed a 'potential significant weapons-related threat' - from the public on Thursday morning. 

Police quickly tracked the teenager down to Tiger Maple Drive in Timberlea and surrounded his parents' house. After the man realized he had been cornered, he allegedly shot himself dead.

Photos posted on Twitter show armed police crouching in the snow outside the home in the early hours of Friday. Officers reportedly later determined two others were involved in the murder plot.

At around 2am on Friday, police arrested the 20-year-old man and the woman at Halifax Stanfield International Airport. The pair had been due to meet there ahead of the killings, officials said.

According to the anonymous official, the woman had earlier tweeted a number of pronouncements that she wished to be posted after her death. The contents of these tweets remain unknown.

At about 11am, police arrested the final suspect, the 17-year-old boy, in Cole Harbour.

Speaking on Friday night, RCMP Sargent Alain LeBlanc said the plot to kill a large number of people at the mall - which has not been named - is not believed to be related to Islamic terrorism.

Officer Brennan also said he wouldn't classify the plan as a 'terrorist event'. Instead, he said the four alleged plotters 'had some beliefs and were willing to carry out violent acts against citizens'.

Police at the scene on Friday morning: Officer Brunner said the plot was 'not culturally-based', adding: 'Had [the suspects] been able to carry out their intentions the possibility for a large loss of life was definitely there'

He added that the plot was 'not culturally-based', saying: 'Had [the suspects] been able to carry out their intentions the possibility for a large loss of life was definitely there.'

Speaking to AP, a senior government official confirmed the plot was not terror related. The official spoke on condition of anonymity because they were not authorized to speak publicly.

Police have released no details about the motive. During a press conference on Friday night, Officer Brennan declined to release the exact location of where the four allegedly plotted to attack.

'We believe we have apprehended all known individuals in this matter and have eliminated the threat. We are not seeking any further suspects at this time in relation to this investigation,' he said.

On Friday, Mike Savage, mayor of Halifax, applauded the work of police in Canada, describing the arrests as 'a great example of the fine work they do on a daily basis to help keep Canadians safe.'

'We have among the best emergency response in the country,' he told CBC News. 'The good news is they discovered all this and dealt with it very effectively. We always have to be vigilant.' 

In a statement, Canadian Public Safety Minister Steven Blaney also congratulated the efforts of officers in Canada and Geneva, Illinois, as well as border officials. Police are investigating.
