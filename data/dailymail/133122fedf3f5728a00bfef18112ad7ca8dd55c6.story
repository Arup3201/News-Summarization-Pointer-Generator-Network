When you’re married to a model, the body focus is  usually on them.

But musician Professor Green has now been persuaded to transform his own physique by his wife Millie Mackintosh, star of Made In Chelsea.

The Quality Street heiress got into shape for their wedding last autumn by weight lifting with personal trainer Richard Tidmarsh – and now Green is trying the same programme.

The lanky 6ft 3in singer and rap star started working out in January, when he had a respectable 20.4 per cent body fat.

Now, after just eight weeks, he is down to 15.3 per cent fat and has gained 7 kg of lean muscle.

Professor Green is the new face of Lynx deodorant, so the public will soon get to see the results for themselves in the notoriously steamy ad shots...

People with chronic pain could be helped by improving the quality of their sleep, new research suggests.

Dr Nicole Tang said: 'Sleep has a naturally recuperative power. A greater treatment emphasis on sleep may help patients improve their daytime functioning'

Feeling less tired helps them be more active – which in turn eases symptoms.

Researchers measured the activity, sleep and symptoms of chronic pain patients round the clock for a week.

Dr Nicole Tang, of the University of Warwick, said: ‘Engaging in physical activity is a key treatment process in pain management.

‘Very often, clinicians would prescribe exercise classes, physiotherapy, walking and cycling programmes. But who would like to engage in these when they feel like a zombie?

‘Sleep has a naturally recuperative power. A greater treatment emphasis on sleep may help patients improve their daytime functioning.’

It takes four weeks on average to get an appointment with your own GP at a group practice, a survey found.

Only one in 20 people see their own doctor every time. The poll of more than 2,300 Britons, by medical negligence solicitors the Medical Accident Group, suggests a family doctor may be a thing of the past.

In fact, 72 per cent of people no longer even request an appointment with their own regular doctor.
