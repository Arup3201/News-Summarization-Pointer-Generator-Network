Universal Pictures and the filmmakers behind the planned N.W.A. biopic 'Straight Outta Compton' are distancing themselves from an offensive casting announcement for the film.

The company said in a statement late Thursday that 'the filmmakers ... did not approve and do not condone the information in this casting notice. We regret and sincerely apologize for being in any way associated with the offensive descriptions it contained.'

Sande Alessi Casting posted an open call earlier this week that sought women in four categories.'A girls' were described as 'the hottest of the hottest' and could be of any ethnicity.

'B girls' were to be 'fine girls, long natural hair, really nice bodies,' the open call said. 'Small waists, nice hips. You should be light-skinned. Beyonce is a prototype here.'

'D girls,' however, were to be 'African-American... Poor, not in good shape. Medium to dark skin tone.'

Gawker.com quoted the casting call in an article Thursday. The casting company has since removed the announcement from its Facebook page.

A woman who answered the phone at Sande Alessi Casting on Thursday declined comment to the Associated Press and would not identify herself.

Universal has not said if it is still working with the casting company.

Casting: Company Sande Alessi Casting says it's looking for 'an excellent twerker' for the N.W.A. biopic 'Straight Outta Compton'

Seeking: Part of the company's listing on its website says it seeks male 'gang member types, family members and guys with street swag'

Sande Alessi Casting's Kristan Berona described the casting notice as 'just an unfortunate mistake in the lettering that has caused us backlash' while speaking to JET Magazine.

'[The lettering system] is not by any means a ranking of 'A’ is better than ‘B.’ There are notices for hot girls that are the letters 'G' and 'H,'" Berona also said. 'We obviously don’t want to leave anything up that’s offensive to people…I’m obviously going to use a different system now.'

The Sande Alessi Casting website shows it is still inviting African-American men and women to audition as extras for 'Straight Outta Compton' at an open call later this month.

Part of the company's listing on its website says it seeks male 'gang member types, family members and guys with street swag.'

For women, 'We are also seeking all types of African American women' which include 'hot models, sassy around-the-way girls, moms, aunts, neighbors.'

A Friday listing on Sande Alessi Casting's Facebook page says it is also looking for a young woman from any ethnic background who 'must be an excellent twerker.'
