This winter season Verbier has never been hotter. 

The Swiss snow-capped village,  known as a playground for the rich and a place where the famous go to be seen, has gained a new caché.

A spate of exclusive restaurant and high-end bar openings, high-profile visits by royals and a sharp rise in the cost of holidaying or buying there means it is now the destination for fur-lined, private jet owning pop stars, princes and those with pockets deeper than its valleys.

Even well established and ritzy nearby resorts in Switzerland such as Gstaad, St Moritz, Zermatt and Davos are struggling to keep up as Verbier's chalet prices soar and oligarch's  money  pours in like glühwein.

The resort's association with royal families certainly has helped. Prince Andrew and his ex-wife Fergie are Verbier regulars, as is Princess Mary of Denmark and Prince Frederik of Denmark. The Beckhams ski here. So do Leonardo Dicaprio, Jude Law, Jamie Oliver and Jemima Khan.

This month Pixie Lott and her boyfriend booked into the newly opened W hotel, which charges up £6,800 (CHF10,650) for a night in a palatial 184 sq m suite with separate loft, Jacuzzi and terrace.

Even the ski lifts are starry. One has been named after Diana Ross (who used to be married to a Verbier local) and another after James Blunt (who has a chalet here).

Prince Andrew and the Duchess of York recently bought a private chalet in a prime location for Princess Eugenie and Beatrice to make tracks from. 

The family, along with some friends, spent time here this month before news of a sex scandal broke (which Prince Andrew strenuously denies) forcing him to return home early. 

The seven-bedroom pad is rumoured to have cost £13 million and require six staff, including a chef.

Richard Branson's Verbier Lodge, not far away, was included in Forbes' list of 'places where you can vacation like a billionaire'.

But really, everything in Verbs (as it's known) is premium.

Nearly 100 lifts and more than 400 km of ski runs for all levels of expertise spread across the 4 Valleys ski area

Despite its small size the village knows how to throw a party. 

'Come wearing either a party hat or powder skis; there's never a dull moment at this resort,' crooned Pippa Middleton about Verbier in a recent Vanity Fair column about top places to ski.

A bar bill at one of the nightclubs could cost the same amount as a deposit on a small house, Prada jackets are snapped up on the High Street like scarves and the local art gallery has sold original Andy Warhols for £500,000.

The Farm is a Verbier institution  in it's fifth decade which stays open until 4am. Still run by the Berardis, the two Italian brothers who founded it way back in 1971, it still has an opulent Seventies feel.

Sarah Ferguson is a fan of the club and has often visited over the years. If you leave hungry and penniless after an evening there, swing by the bakery window (between Farm Club and the Place Centrale) for a ham and cheese croissant on the way home.

The even more showy old Coco club sold cocktails for £5,000 in huge ice sculptures the shape of a ski chalet, full to the brim with Krug Grand Cuvee champagne, Hennessy Paradis brandy and other 'secret ingredients'. Its wallpaper was hand-painted, its curtains were fur and the walls were covered in £30,000 worth of gold leaf.

Several up-market restaurants have recently opened  including Etoile Rouge Restaurant (where you can slip onto the dance floor after dinner) and Le Mouton Noir (which has cabaret and live music every afternoon). A sign of the clientele in Verbier, a sushi restaurant has  opened this year on the High Street.

Nomad Sushi Lounge uses Binchotan charcoal for flavour and serve grade 11 Kobe beef imported directly from Japan, and there's a takeaway menu for those who'd rather not brave the cold.

If you visit for the skiing there are nearly 100 lifts and more than 400 km of ski runs for all levels of expertise spread across the 4 Valley region. From the top of the ski area – Mont Fort, at 3330m – the views reach as far as the Matterhorn and Mont Blanc.

At least for now, they haven't divided the slopes into VIP areas, although that day may not be far off.
