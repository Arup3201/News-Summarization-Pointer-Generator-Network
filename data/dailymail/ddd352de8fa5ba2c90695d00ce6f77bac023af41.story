Arsenal’s players have been basking in Sunday’s 3-0 Community Shield win against Manchester City, by posing with their trophies, and in Alex Oxlade-Chamberlain and Kieran Gibbs’ case, playing Scalextric.

Theo Walcott and goalkeeper Wojciech Szczesny both took to Instagram to share photos of themselves smiling with the FA Cup and Community Shield trophies at Arsenal's training ground.

Oxlade-Chamberlain and Gibbs celebrated in less conventional style by playing a game of Scalextric at a barbecue.

Silverware: Wojciech Szczesny, who loves a selfie, lets someone else do the honours on this occasion

Child's play: Kieran Gibbs, his twin brother  and Alex Oxlade-Chamberlain play a game of Scalextric

The midfielder claimed that he had 'schooled' Gibbs and his twin brother at the retro game.  

Arsenal’s players appear to be in high spirits after ending their nine-year long trophy drought in May with the FA Cup win, and following that up with Sunday’s Community Shield success.

The mood looks to be very positive at the club, with players sharing selfies and photos of themselves celebrating the Community Shield win at Wembley.

High spirits: Mathieu Flamini and Aaron Ramsey can't wait to get on the bubbly after beating Manchester City

Walcott will be desperate to get back to fitness soon and join his team-mates, who looked sharp in disposing of the Premier League champions.

Gibbs was particularly impressive on that occasion, and he will almost certainly start against Crystal Palace on Saturday, along with Szczesny. Oxlade-Chamberlain will likely be a substitute as he returns to full fitness.
