Peter Moores is adamant Alastair Cook has recovered from losing the one-day captaincy and is ready to lead England forward in a run of 17 Tests in under a year.

Cook was devastated to be axed from 50-over cricket on the brink of his first World Cup and has watched as England have struggled to improve without him under new captain Eoin Morgan. 

Yet Moores says his relationship with Cook is undamaged and they have been busy planning for their imminent three-Test series against the West Indies.

'I've spoken to Alastair quite a bit and he's in a good place,' said the England coach ahead of the do or die World Cup match against Bangladesh. 'He's outside of this and is able to plan for Test cricket.

'Our working relationship hasn't changed. He's been an international for a long time and he realises it's a tough business and things change. He's thrown his focus totally into the big Test cricket to come.'

That Caribbean series follows this World Cup and begins a year of Test cricket that includes a home series against New Zealand and another Ashes before visits to the UAE to face Pakistan and then South Africa.

Moores admitted that national selector James Whitaker has spoken to Jonathan Trott about a possible return to the Test side. 

England may face a West Indies side without Chris Gayle — expected to retire from international cricket after this World Cup — and many of their best players could take part in the Indian Premier League instead. England will therefore consider resting players because they have so much important cricket ahead of them, not least the establishing of what will have to be a new one-day side.

Jimmy Anderson and Stuart Broad — prime candidates to be protected from burn-out — will both resist any attempts to force them to rest.

Anderson is four wickets away from overtaking Sir Ian Botham as England's leading Test wicket-taker and wants his family to join him for the first Test in Antigua in the hope he will reach the landmark there.

Meanwhile, Moores on Sunday insisted he had no regrets about returning as England coach despite the huge pressure which comes with a poor showing at the World Cup.

'No regrets at all,' said Moores. 'I felt I could make a difference. We know we've been behind in the one-day format and have to get better.'
