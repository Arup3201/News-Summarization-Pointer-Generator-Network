A large column of Russian tanks, heavy weapons and combat troops entered eastern Ukraine earlier this week, NATO's top commander claimed today, prompting fears of an re-escalation in the seven month old conflict.

U.S. General Philip Breedlove said his officials witnessed the force cross over the 'completely wide-open' border between the countries at some point in the last two days.

The Russian Defense Ministry quickly rejected Breedlove's statement as groundless and continues to deny that its troops have entered eastern Ukraine to help pro-Russian separatists fighting against forces loyal to the Kiev-based government.

The news comes the U.N. Security Council held an emergency session on Ukraine amid worries about a renewal of the full-scale conflict in the rebel-held east.

Speaking in the Bulgarian capital Sofia, General Breedlove said: 'We have seen columns of Russian equipment, primarily Russian tanks, Russian artillery, Russian air defense systems and Russian combat troops entering into Ukraine.'

He wouldn't say how many fresh troops and weapons have moved into Ukraine and wouldn't specify how the alliance obtained the information, but added that the force was spotted in the last two days. 

The Russian Defense Ministry quickly rejected Breedlove's statement as groundless.

The West and Ukraine have continuously accused Moscow of fueling a pro-Russian insurgency in eastern Ukraine with troops and weapons - the claims Russia has rejected.

The news comes as UN officials with the Organization for Security and Cooperation in Europe called an emergency session on Ukraine amid concerns of a re-escalation of fighting.

The main city in the eastern Ukraine, Donetsk, has seen its heaviest shelling in recent weeks despite a cease-fire signed two months ago between Ukraine and Russia-backed separatists.

The cease-fire called on September 5 has been violated almost daily.

The Security Council has met well over a dozen times on Ukraine since the crisis began early this year, but little action can be taken as permanent member Russia has veto power.

This morning heavy artillery fire rocked Donetsk - the rebel-held industrial city that represents a de facto capital for pro-Russian separatists in eastern Ukraine. It was unclear whether the fire came from the government forces besieging the city, or from rebel resistance troops. 

There were also reports of heavy clashes in the outskirts of the rebel-held city of Luhansk, where separatists fired on a government posititon near the village of Schastya.

More than 4,000 people have died since government forces moved in April to put down an armed insurrection by the rebels in the two regions, which border Russia. 

Kiev says it is redeploying forces in eastern Ukraine to prepare for a possible new rebel offensive.
