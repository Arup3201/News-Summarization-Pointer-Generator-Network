The pilot of Air Force One has revealed for the first time how they feared the presidential jet would be rammed by hijacked jet in the hours after the 9/11 terror attack.

Colonel Mark Tillman said he and his crew received a radio message saying 'Angel is next' as America reeled from the attack on the twin towers.

Angel was the secret call sign for Air Force One as it left Sarasota, Florida, where President Bush had been told about the attacks on the Twin Towers.

Under threat: President Bush and staffers look out at fighter jets accompanying Air Force One en route from Sarasota, Florida, to Shreveport, Louisiana

Tillman revealed air traffic controllers also gave them an ominous warning that another passenger jet was close to them that was not responding to calls.

'As we got over Gainesville, Fla., we got the word from Jacksonville Center. They said, "Air Force One you have traffic behind you and basically above you that is descending into you, we are not in contact with them - they have shut their responder off".

'And at that time it kind of led us to believe maybe someone was coming into us in Sarasota, they saw us take off, they just stayed high and are following us at this point.

'We had no idea what the capabilities of the terrorist were at that point.'

Tillman said he flew the specially adapted Boeing 747 out into the Gulf of Mexico to see if the other plane would follow.

Concern: President Bush speaks to vice president Dick Cheney by phone aboard Air Force One on September 11

When the other jet continued on its route he was later told it was an airliner that had lost its transponder -which sends out an electronic identification signal - and the pilots had failed to switch to a new radio frequency.

Tillman said the threat remained and he received the message:'We got word from the vice president and the staff that 'Angel was next,' Angel being the classified call sign of Air Force One.'

'Once we got into the Gulf and they passed to us that 'Angel was next,' at that point I asked for fighter support. If an airliner was part of the attack, it would be good to have fighters on the wing to go ahead and take care of us.'

The senior pilot said President Bush's plans to fly to Washington DC were scrapped and he landed at air force bases in Louisiana and Nebraska from where the president addressed the nation.

Tillman said he was fearful Air Force One would be attacked when he brought the plane back to Andrews Air Force base in Washington DC.

'All along, everybody knew I was bringing him home, so my fear was they've done all of this, they know Air Force One is eventually going to come back to Washington, D.C.; they are sitting there, they're waiting for us,' he said.

Tillman, who now flies a corporate jet after retiring from his duties with Air Force One in 2009, said he fears terrorists will launch another attack.

He told Fox News:'I'm a strong believer that there will be other attacks.

'They caught us with our pants down, they attacked our country, they attacked from within... You got to assume right now that they're going to go ahead and infiltrate us and they're going to go ahead, take advantage of everything we offer to them.'

He added:'I think President Bush did a great job making sure the American people realize our safety is important, but we've got to go ahead and protect each and every one of us, take care of each other and change the way we do business so the terrorists won't take advantage of us anymore.'
