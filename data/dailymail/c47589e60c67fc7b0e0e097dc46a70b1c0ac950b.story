When it came to chucking-out time at Downing Street parties, it was my job to make sure all the guests actually left.

No matter how many glasses they’d had, you didn’t want people walking past desks with confidential papers and taking a peek.

On occasion, though, I had the opposite role, standing at the exit holding back furious journalists and civil servants trying to make last orders at the Red Lion on the grounds that Newsnight was still broadcasting live outside and half of them couldn’t stand up.

Alcohol is integral to the culture of Westminster and Whitehall, McBride claims

Westminster is the binge-drinking 
capital of Britain. Compared with now, I look back at the way I lived 
then with disbelief. At the time, though, I couldn’t believe my luck.

By
the age of 25, when I was working as a civil servant for Customs before
being taken on by Gordon, I was already — by any measure — an 
alcoholic. I used to walk past Smithfield Market in London at 7 am and 
often conclude that it made perfect sense for me to do my paperwork in 
one of the 24-hour bars rather than at my desk.

When I landed a job at the Treasury, life became more complicated. I had to be on call for ministers at any time, and the day was usually so busy with meetings that I couldn’t just slope off to the pub.

So my daily routine became a quick two pints while going out ‘to get a sandwich’ at lunchtime, two hours in the pub with colleagues straight after work, then back to the Treasury with a six-pack to do another three hours’ work.

I’d have a can on the Tube and another four at home, before falling asleep on the sofa. Occasionally, I’d arrive at the Treasury knowing I’d done three hours’ work the previous night — but not remembering what it was.

As time went on, my choice of alcohol was largely unchanged — lager and white wine, usually at the same time — but my levels of consumption grew ever worse.  

It certainly didn’t help that my role as Gordon’s spin doctor only really required me to be at the end of a phone both to him and the media. Or that I was practically encouraged to take journalists for boozy lunches, long afternoons in the pub and late-night karaoke sessions. 

The occasions when I couldn’t remember the previous night’s events became more frequent and more worrying. Once, I tried to obtain entry to the Treasury at 2 am and had a rambling row with the custodian — only for his supervisor to come down and tell me I was outside the Foreign Office.

In September 2003, on one of my first overseas trips as the Treasury’s head of communications, we all gathered at the end of the day in the recreation room at the British embassy in Dubai to watch Arsenal v Manchester United. I sat down with 15 cans of beer and started drinking at a ridiculous pace.

When Ruud Van Nistelrooy missed a penalty, I jumped up and yelled at the screen: ‘Have that, you ****** ********! You cheating ******!’  It was only then that I realised quite how many children were in the room, as well as the ambassador and his family.

There was one man who always resisted alcohol, one politician who exemplified dipso-discipline ¿ and that was Gordon Brown, his former spin doctor says

Gordon looked horrified, Ed Balls rather amused. And yet I can barely remember anyone in my entire time in the civil service or politics taking me to one side and telling me to take it easy.

That’s partly because alcohol is so integral to the culture of Westminster and Whitehall, that while I was seen as a big drinker, I wasn’t totally beyond the norm.

When Freddie Flintoff famously peed in the flowerbeds at a No. 10 reception for the 2005 Ashes victors, the reaction of many hardened Westminster drinkers was: ‘Sounds a bit tame.’

Indeed, it’s no exaggeration to say that I’d still be an alcoholic if I’d remained in my job. Who could avoid the summer and Christmas parties when politicians and government departments always bought far more booze than was necessary? Booze that, naturally, everyone felt they had to finish off.

But there was one man who always resisted, one politician who exemplified dipso-discipline — and that was Gordon. He was quite capable of nursing the same glass of wine for two hours at a Downing Street reception. Despite this, he showed tremendous tolerance when I missed morning meetings or flights to Brussels, and fell over or dropped glasses at receptions.

Once, in front of half the Treasury staff, I’d had a one-sided physical altercation with a civil servant during a quiz night, and Gordon was told to speak to me about it.

Bashfully, he addressed me about controlling my temper — but mentioned nothing about the fact I was drunk.

On the odd occasion when he came into my office late at night, he’d even manage to ignore the eight empty cans of lager on the desk. But that was because no matter how far gone I might be, I retained the ability to talk to him coherently and authoritatively about what was in tomorrow’s papers and what our line should be.

Except once, in 2006.

I’d just returned from a friend’s stag do in Riga, which had ended with a Sunday football match at Old Trafford — so I’d been drinking for 36 hours. Gordon called at the end of the game and asked me what was going to be in the papers.

I barely knew what day it was. Staggering through a beer garden, I rambled incoherently and then shouted: ‘It’s words. It’s words. Just words. Written in ink. It’s just ink, Gordon.’

My friends from the stag do were sitting on the wall of the pub, killing themselves laughing.

‘Mm-hmm, I see,’ said Gordon. Then he added gently: ‘And, erm, what will be in the Telegraph?’ He kept up the conversation for ten minutes, working his way through every paper and letting me dig myself ever deeper into the hole.

Finally, he said: ‘Well, thank you, Damian. Get back to your . . . ah . . . celebrations.’

Gordon wasn’t averse to some reflected glory when it suited him. In 2009, the celebrities who’d climbed Mount Kilimanjaro for Comic Relief were invited to a No 10 reception with local schoolchildren and, while there was a great cast list due to attend, the real star was Cheryl Cole.

Cheryl and Girls Aloud bandmate Kimberley Walsh were very late to the event, meaning Gordon Brown - and a very annoyed Gary Barlow - had to wait

There was an art to timing Gordon’s 
arrival at these things.

We’d keep all the celebrities who arrived early
in a holding room and tell them they’d be going into the main reception
just as soon as Gordon had finished his phone call with the Israeli 
Prime Minister — always our default excuse when we wanted to say he was 
busy.

What we’d really 
be doing was waiting for  the biggest star to arrive, so he could walk 
into  the reception alongside them for the  benefit of the cameras, not 
to mention the  screaming children.

But obviously, you couldn’t say to the 
other celebrities: ‘Sorry, guys, just waiting for the A-lister to arrive
and then we can go in,’ or they might be a tad put out.

On
this occasion, Cheryl and Girls Aloud bandmate Kimberley Walsh were 
very late, Gordon was waiting to be summoned from his flat, and the 
various other stars in the holding room were beginning to get a bit 
peeved at waiting.

Especially Gary Barlow. Eventually, the back gates of Downing Street swung open, a swanky car pulled in and one of the guards gave a thumbs-up.

We got Gordon down straight away and he marched into the holding room, apologising profusely to the other celebrities for the wait and just giving time for Cheryl magically to arrive right on cue behind him.

Except she didn’t. There was still no Cheryl.

‘Can we just hold on, everyone,’ I said. ‘We just need to warn the kids upstairs that you’re coming up.’ We didn’t really. They were getting almost as bored of waiting as the celebrities, but we needed some excuse for the extra delay.

Colleagues went running all round the building looking for where Cheryl and Kimberley had got to, and one eventually rushed up and whispered that they were on their way.

One of our most star-struck special advisers had intercepted them at the back door and taken them for a quick look round the Cabinet room. I mentally started revving up my chainsaw, but said calmly: ‘Oh Gordon, apparently two other guests have just arrived — so let’s just hold on for them.’

The eventual moment of Gordon walking in with Cheryl to the screams of the kids was great — apart, that is, from Gary Barlow scowling in the background. It came as little surprise to me when he came out for the Tories at the 2010 election.
