Environmental health chiefs have recalled frozen lamb, beef and mutton trim supplied by a farm raided by police during the horsemeat scandal.

The Food Standards Agency said that the meat products, supplied by the company formerly trading as Farmbox Meats in Aberyswyth, are believed not to have been subject to 'proper temperature controls'.

The FSA said that all products of all dates and batch codes are subject to the recall as they do not comply with 'traceability requirements'.

Farmbox Meats, based in Llandre, was raided by police and FSA officers back in February as part of the investigation into the horsemeat scandal.

Production at the plant was suspended for a month as part of the inquiry into alleged mislabelling of foods.

At the time, company owner Dafydd Raw-Rees insisted that there had been no cross contamination of meats.

But burgers made by the award-winning Burger Manufacturing Company (BMC) in Builth Wells were reported to have been found with traces of British horsemeat in them and were said to have been served up at local schools and hosptitals.

Allegations: Farmbox Meats was raided by the FSA and police after burgers made from meat it supplied were alleged to contain horsemeat

The company claimed that the meat used to make the burgers was bought from Farmbox Meats.

Farmbox was allowed to re-open again the following month.

There is no indication that today's recall is connected with the horsemeat scandal.

'Hygiene issues' meant that production at the plant was stopped again in April, allegations that were disputed by the firm's lawyers.

Mr Raw-Rees threatened to take legal action against the FSA but the firm went into receivership back in June and is no longer trading.

An FSA spokesman told MailOnline that the the recall is as a result of ongoing investigations surrounding Farmbox.

The spokesman said that inadequate records held by the company means that officials cannot identify where meat was sent to from the site, so it has issued a recall in case any food manufacturers are still in possession of the meat.
