Sydney's housing prices are now among the most expensive in the world and easily the priciest properties in Australia.

The median price for a house in Sydney is now $845,000 according to the latest figures released by property analysts RP Data, almost $300,000 more than the average property prices in Melbourne and Perth.

But how much more can the price of a home in Sydney actually get you in other Australian capital cities?

The median price for a house in Sydney is now $845,000 according to the latest figures released by property analysts RP Data, almost $300,000 more than the average property prices in Melbourne and Perth

Sold just over a week ago for $845,000, this three bedroom property in Baulkham Hills is what house-seekers in Sydney can expect to find for that median price.

Although the land is generously sized, at 929 square metres, the property is positioned a lengthy 35km from Sydney's CBD. The associate director of Raine and Horne Double Bay, Monique March, told Daily Mail Australia that the $845,000 price tag wouldn't buy anything 'fantastic' near Sydney's coast.

'It could buy you a two bedroom property in Bondi with a balcony but no view and probably no parking,' she said.

'You might be able to get something small in the city near Darlinghurst or Surry Hills without a view but you won't find any houses in the east.'

Ms March said her firm had recently sold a 56 square metre unit in Bondi with no balcony and parking for $850,000, while further west in Newtown they sold a two bedroom unit for $810,000, also with no parking.

MELBOURNE 

 28 Separation Street Fairfield VIC 

This two bedroom home in Fairfield near Melbourne, was also auctioned off for $845,000 in December this year

Although sitting on a far smaller block of land, 557 square metres, the Californian Bungalow is positioned only 9km – less than a 30 minute drive – from Melbourne's CBD

However, licensed estate agent Paul Pfeiffer from Victoria told Daily Mail Australia that Sydney's median price would still only buy a modest apartment directly in Melbourne's CBD

In Melbourne, where the median house price is $285,000 dollars less than Sydney's at $560,000, $850k can secure a far more spectacular home.

This two bedroom home in Fairfield, was also auctioned off for $845,000 in December this year. Although sitting on a far smaller block of land, 557 square metres, the Californian Bungalow is positioned only 9km – less than a 30 minute drive – from Melbourne's CBD.

However, licensed estate agent Paul Pfeiffer from Victoria told Daily Mail Australia that Sydney's median price would still only buy a modest apartment in Melbourne's CBD.

'It's more likely to get you and un-renovated 80 square metre apartment with no off-street parking. You'd probably be looking at older style apartments,' he said.

He said house-hunters would more likely find a two or three bedroom home about 15km out of the city , however it was still more likely to be of an older style and only renovated within the last 10 years.
