Two patriotic restaurant owners have been fined for flying flags honoring U.S. troops above their Georgia eatery.

CJ's Hot Dogs co-owners Darren Miller and Dean Patterson received a citation on Friday ordering them to remove the nine flags which authorities said violated city of McDonough law.

The owners raised the flags for the U.S., the state of Georgia and all branches of the military three months ago.

But a code enforcement officer considered the flags to be the same as signs - a violation under city law.

The proud Americans believe it is their right to salute the country's service men and women.

'I'm an ex-firefighter for DeKalb county. My partner here [Patterson] is a police officer,' Miller, whose father is a Vietnam veteran, told Fox News.

'There's
just not a lot of places out there honoring our men and women that 
serve, whether it's police, fire or military.

'So that's the way we 
wanted to decorate our restaurant. That's how it's been ever since day 
one.

'I'm just floored...I'm tired of being pushed around for supporting our local men and 
women and I'm not going to be pushed around anymore.'

Patterson said he was shocked when Miller called him saying he'd received a citation.

'When
he told me it was about us flying out flags, I was just devastated,' he said.

'We 
don't understand why we are being told we can't do that when he honor 
and we respect our law enforcement, fire and military.

'Without our military protecting our borders, we have nothing guys. 
We're just two small business owners that make a difference.'

However, after airing their grievances on Fox News on Friday, city authorities stepped in to cancel the fine.

City
Administrator Frederick Gardiner said the ordinance that classifies the
flags as signs is vague and asked for the citation to be dropped.

Gardiner said he didn't realize code enforcement officers had cited the restaurant and indicated the ordinance needs to be re-written.

Meanwhile, Miller said he has been inundated with support from people across the state.

'The support has been great. We're 
having people drive from hours away to come support our restaurant,' he said.

'Now the city is backpedalling a little bit, saying now it's a permit 
issue. I just don't think I should have to pay money to 
fly the American flag.'

Miller said he's overwhelmed by the kind words from customers, with restaurant was full of supporters yesterday
