Karen Otmani, pictured, has been jailed for life after she killed her partner and hid his body in a wheelie bin in her bedroom

A woman who killed her boyfriend then hid his body in a wheelie bin in her bedroom for 11 days has been jailed for life.

Karen Otmani, 42, drugged Shaun Corey then tied him to her bed at her home in south London, before placing a plastic bag over his head on June 4 last year.

She then hid his body in the green bin for 11 days before a police search revealed what she had done, the court heard.

When police found Mr Corey, 42, his body was so decomposed they could not say how he died.

Otmani was found guilty of murder at  the Old Bailey on Friday and was told she would have to serve a minimum term of 17 years.

She put him into the bin with the help of her friend, Bernard Beddoe, laid it on its side, and covered it up in her home in Forest Hill.

Otmani had been talking about getting rid of her on-off lover and had even asked another boyfriend to experiment with some blue liquid to see if it would knock him out.

Bobbie Cheema, prosecuting, told the jury: 'When she began to speak about killing Mr Corey, he did not take it seriously.'

Mr Corey was heard arguing with Otmani in her bedroom before they were joined by Beddoe, 60, whom she called Uncle.

New boyfriend Keith Jones rang police after visiting the flat and being told 'He’s in there'.

Miss Cheema said: 'She said she’d measured her freezer but it was too small and she needed to get another freezer.”

The court heard that Otmani told officers: 'I killed him. He freaked me out and I killed him.'

Judge Gerald Gordon told Otmani: 'For reasons best known to yourself, you formed the intention to kill your on-off partner.

'You concealed his body for a significant period, causing extra suffering for his family.'

Mother-of-two Otmani wore a pink top in the dock. She showed no emotion but thanked the judge after she was sentenced.

Beddoe, of Brockley, south London, was found guilty of assisting an offender and was remanded for reports to December 7.
