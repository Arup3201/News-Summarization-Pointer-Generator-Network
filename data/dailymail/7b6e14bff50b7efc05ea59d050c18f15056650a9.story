Search and rescue officials are searching for two hikers after rescuing two others in a remote corner of Washington after waist deep snow left them trapped in the wilderness.

Alejandra Wilson was reported missing on the rugged Pacific Crest Trail Monday, while separate hiker Kristopher Zitzewitz was last seen in the Big Lava Beds area of Gifford Pinchot National Forest. Both are in the southwest of the state.

Matt Margiotta and Kyla Arnold were hoisted aboard a Coast Guard helicopter Tuesday evening  after being plucked from waist-deep snow north of Trout Lake, Washington and were transported to Portland, Oregon. They required no medical aid, said Skamania County Undersheriff Dave Cox.

Rescued: Kyla Arnold and Matt Margiotta were rescued Tuesday after calling for help on Monday from the rugged Pacific Crest Trail in southwest Washington. The duo had gotten there all the way from Mexico, hoping to make it to Canada

They had walked all the way from Mexico on the trail only to run into early season snowfall in their attempt to reach the Canadian border. They called for help Monday after snow obscured their route.

Ground searchers who had the pair’s GPS location got within three-quarters of a mile on Tuesday before the snow and fading daylight forced them to turn back. The helicopter from Astoria, Oregon, took advantage of a weather window to reach them.

Wilson was reported overdue on Monday after she failed to check in with her father, Dane Wilson, of Portland, Oregon, as expected. She was believed to be about a day’s hike ahead of Margiotta and Arnold’s location, or about 20 miles farther north.

'We’ll keep trying to ping her phone, get a location on her,' Cox said, adding he hoped the weather would allow an air search.

According to his blog, Zitzewitz had proudly lost some 300 pounds in recent years. The hiker was lost separately from the others, in an area of Gifford Pinchot National Forest

Safe: Margiotta was plucked from a trail near Trout Lake, Washington Tuesday evening after he and Kyla Arnold were trapped in a snow storm. They were uninjured and taken to Portland, Oregon

Sighting: Arnold (pictured), Margiotta, and Wilson all kept online hiking journals. Arnold's noted her seeing Wilson not long before a snowstorm trapped them all

Her father reported that he last 
heard from her Friday as she was leaving Trout Lake, a tiny hamlet south
 of Mount Adams, for White Pass, Cox said.

More
 than 40 ground searchers and four dog teams searched Tuesday for 
Zitzewitz, 31, of Portland, who became separated from his partner in the
 Big Lava Beds on Saturday.

Cox
 said his office requested that many ground searchers again for 
Wednesday, as well as ATVs, 4-wheeled vehicles, and air support.

Weather in that area was rainy, with temperatures dipping into the low 40s at night, he said.

Margiotta, Arnold and Wilson all kept
 online journals of their travels. Arnold last updated hers on Friday 
and described having recently encountered Wilson, who has gone by the 
name Rocket Llama.

Wilson wrote of her excitement for hiking the trail in her journal titled Pacific Crest Trail 2013.

'PCT,
 here I come! My name's Alejandra, and I'm going to thru-hike the 
Pacific Crest Trail in 2013. It's my very first independently-planned 
trip and long-distance hike and I'm SO EXCITED!'

The young hiker wrote a foreboding message in her journal's bio page: 'I have promised to keep updating from the trail so the folks back home know I'm still alive.'

Wilson's last entry was from home in Portland, Oregon on September 22.

In deep: Margiotta and Arnold spent two days under this tarp after feet of snow fell in just around 18 hours

Arnold
 also wrote of having nearly run out of food after storms forced her and
 Margiotta to huddle under a tarp for four days — long delaying their 
arrival in Trout Lake.

'We finally made it to Trout Lake today and another huge storm is rolling in,' Arnold wrote.
 'Everyone says we can’t make it because of the weather situation, and 
to be honest it’s quite terrifying, but I can’t fathom coming this far 
and giving up.'

Margiotta took to Facebook to relay his tale following the rescue.

Missing: A view from the Pacific Crest Trail shows the area's ruggedness. Waist deep snow stranded hikers Matt Margiotta, Kyla Arnold, and Alejandra Wilson on Monday. Wilson is still missing

Separately: 31-year-old Kristopher Zitzewitz was last seen separately in the Big Lava Beds area of Washington's Gifford Pinchot National Forest. He remained missing Wednesday morning

'My hiking partner and I were caught in a blizzard,' he wrote. Believe it or not dehydration was our biggest concern. After spending 2 days trapped in a tarp and realizing trying to hike out was a death sentence...we were forced to call 911.'

The duo made the call fearing dehydration. But rescuers on the ground were eventually forced to call 911 themselves, he says.

'We are now safe and sound in Portland after being airlifted out by Coast Guard.' he wrote.

Snow has been falling in the Washington mountains since the weekend, which was likely the first snow to fall on Pacific Crest Trail hikers, Cox said. Searchers encountered two other hikers on the trail and persuaded them to turn around.

‘The problem with all the snow on the ground is you can’t even tell where the trail is,’ Cox said. ‘Some folks try to push on and wind up getting lost.’

The Pacific Crest Trail runs 2,650 miles from Mexico to the Canadian border.
