The United States is to send two missile defence ships to Japan to counter the growing threat from both North Korea and China.

Japan has watched with alarm in recent weeks as North Korea carried out a series of missile launches, including firing two medium-range missiles capable of hitting the American ally.

Tokyo has also voiced growing anxiety over China’s military buildup and increasingly assertive behavior in a territorial dispute over East China Sea islands.

Announcement: U.S. Secretary of Defence Chuck Hagel and Japanese Defense Minister Itsunori Onodera  announcethe U.S. is planning to deploy two missile defence ships to Japan

The U.S. feels that Russia’s unopposed annexation of Crimea may give China the confidence to do likewise near its borders.

Defense Secretary Chuck Hagel announced yesterday that two Navy destroyers equipped with missile defence systems would be deployed to Japan by 2017.

‘These steps will greatly enhance our ability to defend both Japan and the U.S. homeland from North Korean ballistic missile threats,’ he said.

He also used unusually strong language when talking about China - and drew parallels between its own actions and those of Russia.

‘Great powers have great responsibilities. And China is a great power,’ he said.

‘You cannot go around the world and redefine boundaries and violate territorial integrity and the sovereignty of nations by force, coercion or intimidation, whether it’s in small islands in the Pacific, or in large nations in Europe.’

Speaking before he leaves for talks in Beijing today, he added: ‘Something else ... that I will be talking with the Chinese about is respect for their neighbors.

‘Coercion, intimidation is a very deadly thing that leads only to conflict.’
