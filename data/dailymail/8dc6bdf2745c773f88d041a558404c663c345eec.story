Cincinnati Bengals defensive tackle Devon Still revealed Sunday that, despite his expectations, his 4-year-old daughter's battle with cancer continues. 

Still, 25, posted on his Instagram account Sunday writing that his  daughter Leah's battle with cancer is not over.

Leah, who has neuroblastoma, underwent testing over the weekend to measure her progress, WLWT reports.  Still was expecting the doctor to declare Leah cancer-free, but that was not the case.

Shut Down: In an Instagram post, Still revealed that he was so hurt by the news that he wanted to 'shut down from everyone' 

Diagnosed: Leah Still (photographed) was diagnosed with stage 4 Neuroblastoma in June and has since undergone a series of surgeries

'I wanted to hear so bad that my daughter's cancer was gone and when I didn't it hurt me bad,' Still wrote in the post. 

He continued in the post writing that he and his family would 'keep faith and keep fighting no matter what.' 

Although Leah got to go home Sunday night, Still wanted her to be able to go home cancer free. 

In September, the Bengals cut Still from the team - though they then resigned him to the practice squad so that he would have health insurance - and a $6,300-a-week salary from the team.  

Treatments: In September, Leah underwent surgery to remove a tumor, she went through rounds of radiation and chemotherapy, and in November she had stem cell replacement therapy

Bengals: Leah's battle with the disease gained national attention early in 2014 when the Bengals cut Still from the roster only to sign him again once they learned of Leah's illness

Days before Still delivered the sad news, he posted a photo of Leah writing that he was 'praying [doctors] come back and tell me my daughter has no more cancer cells in her body.' 

Leah was diagnosed with stage 4 Neuroblastoma in June and has since undergone a series of surgeries, according to WCPO.

Hair: When chemotherapy caused the 4-year-old to lose her hair, Still cut off his own hair in an act of support for Leah

Raised: The 25-year-old has raised more than $1 million for pediatric cancer research through appearances and jersey sales 

Since Leah's battle with cancer began, Still has documented her journey with the disease on social networks. He created the hashtag #LeahStrong, enlisting the support of the public.
