Chris Grayling claimed the legal system was being used as a 'weapon' against Government reforms

Legal aid should not be used by foreigners to fight cases in British courts, the Justice Minister has warned.

Chris Grayling said such cases jeopardise public faith in the justice system.

He also accused law firms and pressure groups of using taxpayers’ money to profit from cases aimed at blocking legitimate Government decisions made by democratically-elected MPs.

In an article for the Telegraph, he argued that the legal system was being used as a ‘weapon’ in order to stop the difficult decisions the Government was taking to ‘secure a better future for our country’.

Claiming that British society was ‘too legalistic’, he added: ‘A minority of law firms and some pressure groups make a healthy living by finding more and more varied ways to challenge government  in court – and getting you to pay  the bill.’

As an example, Mr Grayling cited Public Interest Lawyers – which acted for Iraqis who are claiming that British troops unlawfully killed up to 20 civilians.

But last month, following a year-long public inquiry costing the taxpayer more than £20million, the firm accepted there was no evidence to substantiate the claims.

Mr Grayling, who also has the title Lord Chancellor, is attempting to cut legal aid spending and tighten rules on judicial reviews, despite fierce opposition from the legal profession.

The minister postponed some cuts in legal aid spending until the next Parliament following a protest from barristers last month – but he still plans to trim the cost of publicly-funded legal services.

He added: ‘We have made some exceptions for certain cases involving particularly vulnerable people, such as refugees who arrive in the UK ﬂeeing persecution elsewhere. But why should you pay the legal bill of people who have never even been to Britain?’
