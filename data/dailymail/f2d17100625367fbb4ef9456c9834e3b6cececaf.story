Tony Bellew raised his hand to Nathan Cleverly as tempers flared ahead of their grudge rematch on Saturday.

The bitter rivals clashed for the penultimate time before the first bell of their cruiserweight rematch.

And when Cleverly signalled he would deliver a repeat performance of his victory three years ago, Bellew swiped his hand away.

The pair have traded insults since the Welshman's narrow points win in Liverpool in 2011 and the final press conference was no different.

'There's no pressure,' said Bellew. 'If he comes to fight like he says he does, it's going to be a devastating win for me.

'It's getting real and it's getting close. I'm relaxed, I'm calm, I'm not an angry man. I've seen all this before. It's just business.

'We'll find out who is mentally strong on Saturday. When he gets hit clean lets see if he wants to come back and trade.'

With both men holding minor belts, a coin toss was required to determine who will walk to the ring second.

Bellew won and will make his entrance after his younger rival.

But Cleverly claimed he is the fans' favourite despite the fight being in Bellew's hometown.

'I was walking around Liverpool earlier and it felt like my home town - photos with fans who want me to beat him,' he said.

'It will be a replica of the first fight but more explosive. It's not going twelve rounds, I'll break him up and get him out of there.

'It's deja vu. It's a matter of pushing the repeat button in that Arena and making it 2-0 to silence him again.'
