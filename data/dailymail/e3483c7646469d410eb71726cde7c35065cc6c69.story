A father two lost an eye in a brutal assault by a two teenagers was dealt a second blow after finding out his attacker will spend just 18 months in prison.

Professional archer Christopher Collins, 54, was walking home from a New Year's party when he was set upon by Jay Lloyd, 18, and another 15-year-old.

The pair had drunk large amounts of alcohol and used cocaine. Lloyd lashed out at Mr Collins, fracturing his cheek-bone and bursting his right eyeball.

He later had to have his eye surgically removed to save the sight in his left eye.

He said the sentences, delivered this Friday, feel like 'a kick in the guts' and that he feels 'let down' by the verdict.

Mr Collins, who competed for Wales alongside now Paralympic archer Pippa Britton, said: 'He was looking for a fight - all I wanted to do was go home.

Lloyd was jailed for thee years after pleading guilty at Newport Crown Court but could be out of prison within 18 months on license.

His 15-year-old companion, who cannot be named for legal reasons, was charged with common assault and given a six-month referral order.

Mr Collins said: 'We have just got to try and move on with our lives now. He'll be in prison for 18 months but I'll be without an eye for the rest of my life.'

Prosecutor David Webster told the Newport Crown Court how on New Year's Eve Christopher had gone to a social club with his wife and two adult daughters.

A taxi arrived to take the family home but Mr Collins decided to walk when there was not enough room for all of them.

On his way back Mr Collins passed a group of five young men, one of whom claimed he had bumped into him.

He apologised and walked on but was told by the 15-year-old, 'you can't just walk away'.

Lloyd then joined his friend, and as Mr turned to walk away he felt a 'tremendous pain to the right side of his face.'

Mr Webster said: 'Christopher was utterly helpless.'

Newport Magistrates Court heard last month that Lloyd had consumed 15 cans of lager as wekk as vodka and cocaine before the assault while the 15-year-old had drunk seven bottles of lager, taken cocaine and smoked cannabis.

After the attack, the group of yobs, including the two attackers went on to another party.

Mr Collins managed to ring his wife Jayne, 44, who dialled 999, and the pair were taken in the back of a police car straight to the Royal Gwent Hospital.

Mrs Collins said: 'There was blood coming through his nose, his eye socket, there was so much blood. When they said they were going to do a CT scan I didn't think he would come home.'

The couple were initially told Mr Collins' eye might be saved, but despite being able to see light, he agreed for it to be removed to prevent problems spreading to his left eye.

He said: 'One of the hardest things I've ever done is sign that consent form.'

On January 7 his nose was reset and face rebuilt using four titanium plates, followed by an operation two days later to remove the eye and replace it with a prosthetic one.

Mr Collins is now waiting for a permanent prosthetic eye to be sculpted and fitted.

He said: 'It will help my confidence. I hope to return to work and learn to shoot an arrow left-handed, and using my remaining left eye.'

Speaking adjusting to his injury, Mr Collins said: 'Everything takes a while and things I found very easy before are now totally different. I need more light, my left eye gets tired quickly. Shaving is now one of the hardest things in the world.'

Speaking after Lloyd's sentencing, on Friday, Mr Collins said three years imprisonment was 'a kick in the guts'.

'I believe the judge was very unhappy with the Crown Prosecution Service because if they had brought more serious charges it could have been a longer sentence.'

'I don't think anything would ever have been enough but in 18 months he'll be out on licence.

Mr Collins described the 15-year-old's six-month referral order as 'unbelievable' and said he felt 'incredibly let down by the sentence'.

Judge Thomas Crowther called the charge of wounding 'unbelievable' and criticised the Crown Prosecution Service for limiting his sentencing powers.

Judge Crowther said: 'You inflicted grievous bodily harm and it is on that basis you will be sentenced.

'You accepted you had a very hard punch - it seems to be a matter of pride to you. You are a danger to the public and people who you may chance upon.

'The harm was serious. As to culpability, you were a member of a gang and the victim was outnumbered. You used your fist on a man who was walking away and unable to defend himself. There is no one to blame in this case but you.'

The court heard how Lloyd, who has a previous conviction for violent assault, had handed himself in to the police on January 8 after seeing a post on Facebook detailing the attack on Christopher.

Meirion Davies, mitigating, said: 'He is clearly a man who is profoundly remorseful'.

Lloyd's early guilty plea was given full credit and he was sentenced to three years, half of which will be served in custody and the other half on release on license.
