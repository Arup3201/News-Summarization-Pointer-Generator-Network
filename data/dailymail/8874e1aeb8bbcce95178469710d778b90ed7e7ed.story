Lady Gaga's stylist, fashion director and partner in eccentricity Nicola Formichetti has joined Diesel as artistic director, leaving his role as creative director at Mugler after just two years.

The designer - who announced his departure from French fashion house Thierry Mugler earlier this week - has been chosen by the brand's founder Renzo Rosso to oversee the denim company's international development.

Renzo told WWD: 'I finally met somebody as crazy as I am. I have replaced myself and can go on vacation. I have to spend my time running the [OTB] group and really can't go back. Nicola is here to develop Diesel, the most important part of the group.'

He added that Nicola would be in a 
charge of 'a total view of the Diesel brand - product, communications, 
marketing and interior design. I want him to do bigger things, different
things', adding: 'This is the right man to take the next step for a young company and a brand for people who are young of mind.'

An official announcement is expected to be made today. Nicola is said to
be focusing on making a move from 'high fashion and couture to 
streetwear and activewear' and his new ideas will be implemented within 
the next five to 10 years.

The 35-year-old Italian designer - best known for his work as Lady 
Gaga's stylist - claims he has always been a fan of the pioneering denim
company since his days as an 18-year-old student in London.

Nicola Formichetti is leaving Mugler for Diesel, claiming he wants to 'do something else, even bigger, more global'

He explained: 'I didn't have the money to buy in those days, but their 
stores were the place to be. They did great parties and shows and spoke 
to an audience that was into music and art.

'They did ads with guys kissing. It was very anti-fashion and very appealing to me.

This comes after rumours began circulating yesterday that 
Nicola would be partnering with Diesel after he said he 'wanted to do 
something else, even bigger, more global' after his two-year tenure at 
Mugler.

Formichetti produced his first collection for 
the label in Autumn/Winter 2011-12, and the show featured a catwalk 
appearance from his close friend Gaga.

His
parting of company with the brand is the result of a 'mutual 
agreement', and the designer has been lauded by director general Joel 
Palix for bringing Mugler to the attention of 'a new audience'.

Palix, who is president of Clarins
Fragrance Group and director general of Mugler, said in a statemenrt: 'Nicola has accomplished our original mission of bringing his
energy to the brand.

'With his talent for communication and understanding of modern
imagery and design, Nicola has been instrumental in attracting a
new audience which is undeniably crucial for the future strategy of
the house. He will be a historical part of the Mugler legacy and
known as the force that catapulted us forward.'

Formichetti's collaboration with Lady Gaga began in 2009 at a shoot for V Magazine; Formichetti called their connection 'instant love'.

He acted as fashion director for the 
singer on a number of live performances, and their first music video 
collaboration was for the hugely successful Bad Romance. Formichetti is 
also credited as stylist for her album The Fame Monster and fashion 
director for her Monster Ball Tour.

In 2010 he styled her music video Telephone, and then Alejandro, later putting her in the controversial meat dress, designed by Franc Fernandez.

He landed himself in hot water in 2011 when, talking about his experience in the fashion industry in the July edition of W, he discussed a shoot he styled for Dazed & Confused and said he didn't like working with fat people.

He was quoted saying: 'I was only used to dressing models and skinny kids. And I turned up and it was, like, three fat guys. I just left. That was the last time I tried to work with fat people.'

An immediate attack of negative press lead to Formichetti launching a Facebook campaign to defend his name and deny the comments.

On it he wrote: 'Don't believe everything you read on line please. "I don't work with fat people…" why would someone say such a thing?!

'I know I should just leave it but…I really hate when writers just write whatever they want…'

Following his departure from Mugler, Formichetti will continue as creative director of Uniqlo and Gaga stylist, while continuing with his own fashion line Nicopanda.

Mugler will release a 'new strategic plan' soon, and have said they plan to 'build on its highly successful legacy in fragrance and its new momentum in fashion'.
