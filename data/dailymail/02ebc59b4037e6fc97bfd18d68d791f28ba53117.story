Argentina fans were dancing in the streets of Brazil last night after their side beat Holland in the semi-final of the World Cup to book a place in Sunday's final.

The encounter had to be settled by penalties after both sides failed to replicate Germany's seven-goal flourish against the host nation, with the score at 0-0 after a dull 120 minutes.

Sergio Romero, the South American side's goalkeeper, was the hero of the spot-kicks, stopping two penalties and leading Argentina to a 4-2 victory.

Just when Brazilians thought it couldn't get any worse after Tuesday night's total humiliation in Belo Horizonte, they must now play host to a final featuring their arch-rivals.

Despite his heroics, Romero played down his part in his Argentina's victory. He did not have a shot to save in 90 minutes but made up for that in the shoot-out.

'There is no trick. It's luck. It's reality. One can go in and not go in,' the Monaco goalkeeper told reporters after the match. 'These guys do not give away anything.'

He also told fans: 'Enjoy this moment, because we are going step by step and tomorrow we prepare for the final.'

It was the second straight penalty shootout following a 0-0 draw for the Dutch after the quarter-final against Costa Rica had to be decided from the spot. 

The Netherlands started poorly with Ron Vlaar's first effort being saved. Wesley Sneijder also failed to score, giving their opponents the upper hand.

Lionel Messi, Ezequiel Garay, Sergio Aguero all netted successfully for Argentina, but Maxi Rodriguez's penalty clinched the victory.  

In a game that was going to struggle to live up to the fireworks of last night's first semi-final, both sides shared a handful of opportunities, but neither one dangerously threatened the goal.  

Argentinian fans inside the Corinthians Arena shouted 'siete, siete' or 'seven, seven' hoping the South American's could match the seven goals scored against their rivals Brazil.

Argentina fans go wild as their team win at Arena de Sao Paulo to go through to the World Cup final

A teenager in eastern Nepal committed suicide after her favorite team Brazil lost badly to Germany in the World Cup semi-finals, police said.

Police said the 10th grade student was depressed and hanged herself from the ceiling on Wednesday morning in Bharaul village 250 miles east of the capital Kathmandu.

Supporter Rodrigo Aisen wept with joy as his team knocked in a fourth penalty to secure the win. He celebrated with 20,000 others in the FIFA Fan Fest party in Sao Paulo, and gave his girlfriend a kiss to celebrate.

He says that 'God knows we suffered' with the tight match that had to be decided from the spot. 'But everything is good now, everything is joy!'  

The last time the Argentines made it through to the final in 1990, they lost to the Germans. 

The game was a replay of the 1978 World Cup final, and a chance for both sides to take on Germany for a shot at the title. 

The side, managed by Manchester United incumbent Louis van Gaal, were aiming for a shot at redemption after losing the 2010 final, with the knowledge they were going to have to improve on their narrow penalty shootout victory over Costa Rica to see off the South Americans.
