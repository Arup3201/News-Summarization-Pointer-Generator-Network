Quite the spread: Rosney, 54, takes 38 separate pills and supplements to treat his body and brain. He has an IQ of 192

A man with a claim to being the second-most intelligent person on the planet has revealed that he takes a mixture of 38 drugs and pills every day in a bid to stay in top mental and physical form.

Rick Rosner, 54, boasts an IQ of 192, which has seemingly only been topped by a Greek doctor, Evangelos Katsioulis, according to the world genius directory.

But despite his apparent intellectual capacity, Rosner lists himself as unemployed while he works on writing a book entitled Dumbass Genius.

The former TV writer and bouncer instead spends his time developing theories, working on a book, and visiting some five gyms per day, aided by cocktail of medical supplements.

Rosner, who revealed the routine to Business Insider, listed a staggering array of substances, ranging from coffee and aspirin to an experimental pill designed to remove protein from the brain.

Speaking to MailOnline about his routine, Rosner said he takes the pills because: 'I'd like to remain healthy and live for as long as possible.

'A lot of these things may not do anything for you - if I had to guess maybe only a third of this stuff has benefits.

'I try to read up about what these things are supposed to do - as new studies come out sometimes I swap things in and out.'

'I probably alter what I take on a three-to-four-monthly rotation.'

Along with the supplements, Rosner has also estimated that he spends around two and a half hours per day in the gym, sometimes visiting five locations in a day.

'Working on my book': Rosner, who tweeted this picture of himself recently, now spends his time writing his book Dumbass Genius

When asked why he sticks to the intense routine, he replied: 'I like it', and said that it is part of the 'obsessive' personality which led him to testing his mind rigorously enough to come out with the 192 IQ score.

Rosner, who lives in Los Angeles with his wife of more than 20 years, spent years as a bouncer in bars, and even as a nude model, before starting to work in television.

He said his IQ score was originally came from 'desperation to have something going for me' while working menial jobs and trying to get a girlfriend.

Pills, pills pills: Rosner listed 38 separate supplements, though admits a two-thirds of them probably don't do anything

But even now, after a series of jobs in television and even an Emmy nomination, Rosner defends the tests as 'the best of a bad bunch' when it comes to quantifying intellect.

In a nod to the fact that IQ doesn't tell the whole story, between gym sessions and pill-popping Rosner writes a book of memoirs he will entitle Dumbass Genius.

He said: 'People think of smart people as doing really smart stuff... but I've done a lot of stupid things.'
