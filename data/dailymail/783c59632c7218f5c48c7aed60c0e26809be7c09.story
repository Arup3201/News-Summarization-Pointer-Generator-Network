A horrified Vanessa Feltz has spoken of her shock after being subjected to a torrent of online abuse - including being called a c*** and a whore - after going public about being molested live on TV by Rolf Harris.

During an appearance on This Morning, the veteran presenter said the abuse had made her 'question my faith in human nature' and added it could dissuade victims from coming forward.

'The response has been so 
appalling,' she told Phillip Schofield and Holly Willoughby. 'It makes you question your faith in human nature, really.

Angry: Vanessa Feltz made an angry appearance on This Morning where she told of a week of Twitter abuse

'I've
 been called absolutely everything from a C-word to
 a whore. People have said they can't believe it could be true, they've 
lost all faith in Rolf Harris' judgement that he could dream of 
molesting someone as physically repulsive as [me], said how ugly and
 revolting I am.

'It's just horrid and I'm so lucky 
that I don't actually go online which has protected me from at least some of it, because I certainly 
didn't anticipate [the abuse] and I'm shocked by it really.'

Feltz, 52, spoke out about being molested by Harris on Sunday, revealing how the disgraced groped her during a TV appearance 18 years ago.

Since then, she has been bombarded with cruel comments, with some even accusing her of telling her tale for cash - much to her fury.

'I didn't sell the story - I wouldn't have
 dreamt of it,' she insists. 'I haven't made a penny and why would you want to make 
money out of something as horrible as that?

Vile: Feltz told of being 'upset' by the messages, among them the abusive example pictured

'That's completely untrue and
 the only motivation I had was that someone suggested to me that it 
would be a good thing to do and that was it.'

On Twitter, many of the nasty comments can still be seen, with one, written by a Twitter user named Jack, saying: 'Vanessa Feltz claims Rolf Harris groped her. Surely even Rolf Harris has standards?'

Another, Jo Hoskinson, wrote: 'Apparently #RolfHarris groped #vanessafeltz. Really Vanessa? Does someone need some publicity? #jumponthebandwagon'

One Twitter user, Rob, wrote: 'If #RolfHarris has touched up #vanessafeltz he deserves another 5 years for p***poor taste.'

Another, referred to as Belcher, added: 'Vanessa Feltz, though? You've really let your fans down this time, Rolf.'

Adam Tonner remarked: 'Vanessa Feltz is just a stupid b**** that noone likes #doone'

Although Feltz says she's tough enough to take the abuse, she admitted to being worried about the impact it might have on other victims of sexual abuse.

'One of the greatest fears that people 
who have been abused sexually is is that someone won't believe them or 
they'll be castigated,' she revealed.

Convicted: Rolf Harris, pictured leaving Southwark Crown Court,was found guilty of 12 sex charges last week

'I'm 
fine. I'm a grown-up. I'm 52 years old, I haven't read too much 
of it and I can take it. I've had quite a few years in the press being 
roundly castigated for being fat or being unattractive or whatever it 
happened to be.

'Of course you shouldn't have to take it but I'm fine. A 
little bit upset, as you can see, my feathers have been ruffled, but 
I'll be fine.

'But imagine if I was 17. Imagine if it had been my first
 day as a make-up artist on that programme [The Big Breakfast] or imagine if it had one of 
the other people who suffered from all the terrible things he did.

'I 
think it's a terrible shame, really, that I tell a story about a 
convicted abuser and I'm met with a torrent of abuse. I just don't 
understand what people who tweet that kind of thing are thinking of.'

Harris, 84, was jailed for five years 
and nine months at Southwark Crown Court last Friday for 12 indecent 
assaults on four victims including his daughter’s best friend and an 
eight-year-old.

Other victims to come forward this week include singer Linda Nolan who alleged the paedophile molested her when she was 15.

She claims Harris attacked her while she was backstage in South Africa  - where she and her sisters were due to perform.
