The Supreme Court has overturned the will of a deceased man who left his entire estate to a hospital after being convinced that his children were not biologically his own.

A total of $1.8 million worth of estate was left to the Royal Adelaide Hospital Research Fund by the man, who died in June 2012 and was also known to have repeatedly accused his neighbour of poisoning his plants, according to the Supreme Court judgement.

After one of his daughters challenged the will, the court heard that the father-of-three who emigrated from Italy, was often 'aggressive' and 'hysterical' and suffered from a 'delusional illness' which worsened from 1998 onwards.

The Supreme Court of South Australia overturned the will of a deceased man who left his entire estate to a hospital 

His children recounted to Justice Tom Gray how the 82-year-old often accused his wife of being unfaithful to him and on one occasion, alleged she had been a prostitute and engaged in incest.

In 2000, the judgement records that his wife underwent a lie detector test at the man's insistence, which she passed.

'The deceased said that these results indicated that the person that administered the test was either Dutch or German, and falsified the results of the test as a sign of ethnic unity with his wife, who was born in Germany,' Justice Gray revealed in his final decision.

He had also requested toothbrushes and hair samples from his children on several occasions, before claiming they would be used in DNA sample tests to prove that they were not his biological offspring.

Justice Tom Gray said in his decision that the man appeared to have 'suffered from delusions at the time that he made the alleged will' after hearing that he accused his neighbour of poisoning his plants despite his security camera's showing no evidence. He also accused his wife of being unfaithful and subjected her to a lie detector test

Paranoia was also evident in the deceased's accusations against his former neighbour, who he insisted was poisoning his plants even after relocating to a new home.

The allegations continued even after the surveillance camera's he had installed around his home failed to detect any such behaviour.

In the ruling published earlier this month, Justice Gray wrote that while, 'the deceased's will, on its face, appears to be properly executed' the evidence presented 'raises a suspicion that the deceased suffered from delusions at the time that he made the alleged will, and that these delusions influenced his testamentary intentions'.

A settlement was reached between the hospital and the man's children that would see only $200,000 remain with the Royal Adelaide Hospital while $85,000 was awarded to his granddaughter and the remainder split between his three children.
