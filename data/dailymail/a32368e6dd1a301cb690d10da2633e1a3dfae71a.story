This is the shocking moment a TV chief in Ukraine was assaulted and forced to sign a resignation letter by far-right politicians who broke into his office.

A chaotic video shows Oleksandr Panteleymonov, who led the Ukrainian state TV company, being shouted at and beaten over the head until he gives into the attackers' demands and writes the letter.

The men from the Svoboda party were angered after a ceremony was broadcast from the Kremlin on Tuesday showing Vladimir Putin signing a bill to make Ukraine's Crimea region part of Russia.

Humiliation: Oleksandr Panteleymonov (seated), who heads the Ukrainian state TV company, is shouted at and beaten over the head until he gives into the men's demands and writes a resignation letter

Chaotic scenes: The men accused Mr Panteleymonov broadcasting pro-Russian images during the stand-off in Ukraine - and called him 'Moscow trash', which is a derogatory term for Russians

The men also accused Mr Panteleymonov of broadcasting pro-Russian images during the stand-off in Ukraine - and called him ‘Moscow trash’, which is a derogatory term for Russians.

They yelled to Mr Panteleymonov: ‘Sit down. Write your resignation, quickly now, you animal.’

Svoboda MP Igor Miroshnichenko was involved in the attack, and said afterwards that he was happy to be investigated - even though he believed he was innocent, reported The Guardian.

The MP, who is on the new parliamentary committee on freedom of speech, said Mr Panteleymonov had ‘served Putin and Russian propaganda… at a time when Ukrainians were dying on the streets’.

But Ukrainian interior minister Arsen Avakov said: ‘I am ready to organise all the required investigative efforts as soon as instructed by the general prosecutor.’

Presidential candidate and former boxer Vitali Klitschko told the politicians to immediately resign.

Ouch: Oleksandr Panteleymonov was forced to sign a resignation letter by the angry far-right politicians

Heather McGill, Amnesty International’s Ukraine researcher, said: ‘It is astonishing that a member of the parliamentary committee on freedom of speech was involved in this attack. The acting authorities must send a signal that this sort of behaviour will not be tolerated in Ukraine.

‘This assault on freedom of expression must be immediately investigated and those responsible must be prosecuted. Anything less will only open the door to further attacks against media professionals and activists.

‘The acting Ukrainian authorities must waste no time in demonstrating that basic human rights are protected in Ukraine and that nobody will face discrimination because of their political views or ethnic origin.’

Russia annexed Ukraine's Crimean peninsula this week after residents there voted overwhelmingly to join Russia.

The move came despite warnings by the West to Russian President Putin that annexation violated international law and would be ignored by the world.
