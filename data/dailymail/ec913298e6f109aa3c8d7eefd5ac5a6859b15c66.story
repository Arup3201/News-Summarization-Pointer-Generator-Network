If you found yourself overindulging to the point of tipsiness during the hot spell, you’re in good company… with seagulls.

Experts say the birds are becoming ‘drunk’ by gorging on flying ants, which have been leaving their nests early due to the heat.

Councils around the country have started to take action to control the birds, which have been dive-bombing at people on the street and creating a mess by rummaging through bin bags to find food.

How did I get up here? Britain's seagulls have been getting 'drunk' by eating flying ants

It is believed that the gulls have been acting strangely because the formic acid in the ants’ bodies has been reacting with their stomachs.

Dr Rebecca Nesbit from the Society of Biology, told the Daily Telegraph: ‘Some of the slightly odd behaviour we are seeing could be as a result of these ants – it could leave the gulls slightly drunk.

‘It’s possible because we know that some ants produce formic acid, and it could be having an effect. There have certainly been many, many more of them this summer.

‘The gulls can also get very excited and loud when they eat the ants, so that could be a contributing factor.’

Last week in Plymouth, Devon the city council launched a campaign against the seagull attacks by targeting ‘known feeders’ of the birds.

Councillor Brian Vincent said: ‘We’ve seen a steady rise in the number of gulls and people complaining about their behaviour.’

While residents in Islington, London complained after dive-bombing seagulls turned their street into ‘something out of Alfred Hitchcock’s The Birds’.

Gull expert Peter Rock said seagulls have been moving into urbanised areas for years, so complaints about their bad behaviour came as ‘no surprise’.

He said: ‘It’s the sheer number of gulls in built up areas now. They are right in our faces, and they are not scared.

‘The pest control industry has been trying their best, but they can’t outsmart seagulls.

‘People are trying anything - spikes, tension wires – I even saw a plastic eagle owl once.

‘But they are wasting money on this stuff because seagulls are just too clever.’

The seaside town, Tenby in Pembrokeshire, Wales, introduced a range of ‘bird-proof’ bags this summer to combat the problem of the seagulls eating waste food.

The town clerk Andrew Davies, said Tenby had become ‘an all-you-can-eat buffet for the birds’.

He continued: ‘We get so many complaints about them. They have just become a general nuisance.’
