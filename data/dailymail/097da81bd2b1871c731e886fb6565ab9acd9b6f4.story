The European Union is ‘not working for Britain’, George Osborne warned last night.

The Chancellor said the EU was ‘causing problems for us’ – and warned the continent was ‘pricing itself out of the world economy’.

The stark assessment came as the European Commission confirmed the UK would be charged interest payments if it refuses to pay a disputed £1.7billion surcharge levied last month.

The door is that way: Berlin has also reiterated that Angela Merkel believes the EU’s principle of free movement, which David Cameron wants to curb, is ‘non-negotiable’ 

Berlin has also reiterated that Angela Merkel believes the EU’s principle of free movement, which David Cameron wants to curb, is ‘non-negotiable’.

The German chancellor is said to have warned Mr Cameron that she would rather see Britain leave the EU than allow him to tear up free movement.

But a leading think-tank has suggested limiting all benefits for EU migrants for the first three years to reduce the so-called ‘pull factors’.

Senior Tory MPs warned the Prime Minister he could not afford to back down over the issue – and Mr Osborne suggested there was no longer a place for Britain in an unreformed EU.

He told the BBC’s Newsnight programme: ‘Britain joined [the EU] for economic reasons, and when it’s not working economically for Britain that’s why we get this debate about the membership of the EU and the nature of that membership.

‘I’m someone who wants to stay in the EU, I think that’s right for Britain, but it has to be a reformed EU.’

He said that the EU was ‘morphing more and more into a eurozone focused on the survival of its currency’. He added: ‘It’s perfectly all right for the UK to say as the big country that’s not in the euro, this relationship is not working properly for us.’

Meanwhile, a think-tank has urged Mr Cameron to restrict access to the NHS for migrants from the EU until they have lived here for three years.

For that period they should lose access to almost all benefits, including tax credits, housing benefit and free use of the NHS, according to a report by the think-tank Open Europe, which enjoys close links to Government.

German Chancellor Angela Merkel shares a joke with Italian Premier Matteo Renzi as she insists that changing the right of workers to move freely throughout Europe is not on the table 

The Daily Mail revealed last month that the Treasury is already looking at ways to curb access to tax credits, which are seen as a major incentive for people to travel to Britain to work.

Currently, Britain is spending £5billion every year on tax credits for migrant workers from both inside and outside the EU.

Former Tory leadership contender David Davis said Mr Cameron should face down Mrs Merkel and demand the right to limit immigration from the EU. He said proposals to curb access to benefits would not be enough to satisfy public concerns.

Prominent Eurosceptic Bernard Jenkin backed the call to stand firm, saying: ‘In my view we actually have to take back control over our borders’.

Mr Jenkin said Mrs Merkel’s stance was just a ‘negotiating position’ and urged Mr Cameron to call her bluff.

Last night there were indications Brussels may back down over the size of the £1.7billion additional levy when Mr Osborne holds crisis talks on the issue with fellow EU finance ministers on Friday. One senior EU official said: ‘There is widespread willingness to find a way forward.’
