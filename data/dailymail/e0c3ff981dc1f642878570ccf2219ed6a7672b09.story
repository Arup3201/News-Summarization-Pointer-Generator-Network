Authorities say the first known fatal bear attack in New Jersey was unprovoked and the bear was acting in a 'predatory' manner.

Officials attribute the death of a 22-year-old Rutgers University student from Edison to 'mauling.' 

Darsh Patel was hiking with four friends in the Apshawa Preserve last month when they noticed the bear following them.

Unprovoked: Darsh Patel, 22, is confirmed as the first person in New Jersey history to be killed by a bear, according to authorities (file photo) 

Attacks: Northern New Jersey locals captured this black bear looking for food in their garbage in September. Just a day after the footage was shot,  a black bear mauled a 22-year-old student to death in the woods nearby

Locals: Residents in northern New Jersey often spot bears in and around their yards. There are as many 2,400 bruins in the area's dense forests, but until now had never been a fatal human-bear attack

The group scattered, and Patel's friends, who were not injured, called police when they realized he was missing.

A search team found Patel's body, which showed signs of a bear attack. His body sustained numerous bites and claw marks..A nearby bear was later destroyed.

West Milford police and the Environmental Protection Department issued a statement saying the bear did not seem interested in food. Officials said the bear exhibited 'stalking type behavior.

When authorities found the bear, it was about 30 yards from the body and circling, Department of Environmental Protection spokesman Larry Ragonese said.

It wouldn't leave even after officers tried to scare it away by making loud noises and throwing sticks and stones. 

Mr Patel is confirmed as the first person in New Jersey history to be killed by a bear, according to authorities. 

At the time, locals believed they had filmed the same black bear hunting for food hours before Mr Patel was mauled to death in nearby woods.  

Preserve: The Apshawa Preserve is a 526-acre park with hiking trails

Kelcey Burguess, principal biologist and leader of the state Division of Fish and Wildlife's black bear project, said the bear could have been predisposed to attack but more likely was looking for food.

State and local officials stressed that bear attacks are rare even in a region of the state that may have as many as 2,400 bruins in its dense forests. 

'This is a rare occurrence,' West Milford police Chief Timothy Storbeck said, noting that his department receives six to 12 calls per week regarding bears, usually involving them breaking into trash cans.

Wildlife officials believe there is a current shortage of the acorns and berries that bears eat. The hikers had granola bars and water with them, Storbeck said. 

Officials don't believe the hikers provoked the bear but they may have showed their inexperience when they decided to run.

The safest way to handle a bear encounter is to move slowly and not look the bear in the eye, DEP spokesman Larry Ragonese said.

New Jersey Division of Fish and Wildlife guidelines direct law enforcement to euthanize 'Category I' bears, which are deemed an 'immediate threat to human safety.'

'Bear sightings are not unusual by any stretch in New Jersey,' said Bob Considine, spokesman for the Department of Environmental Protection.

'They have been seen in all 21 counties, although they're obviously most common in the northwest part of the state.'

Black bears rarely pose a threat to humans and often retreat when confronted.

In 2006, a tabby cat scared a black bear up a tree in West Milford. The bear only climbed down and left after the cat's owner had called it back into the house.
