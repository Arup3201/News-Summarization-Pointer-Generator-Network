An archaeologist who stole three 17th century relics found during excavation work on the site of a new shopping centre and tried to sell them on eBay has been spared jail.

James Vessey, 35, took three 17th century Bellarmine vases while excavating earth for the SouthGate shopping centre in Bath, Somerset in 2008.

But Vessey, who was employed by the Museum of London Archaeology to work on the dig, was caught when another archaeologist found the vessels, which date back to 1650, for sale on eBay last year.

He was given a four month suspended sentence and ordered to carry out 270 hours of community service at Bath Magistrates Court after admitting the thefts.

The court had heard that Vessey had a history of stealing historical artefacts from digs and had been jailed for a similar crime for 15 months in 2001.

This time around he was spared a custodial sentence after the court heard that he was no longer working as an archaeologist and had been dealing with illness and the death of his parents.

Avon & Somerset Constabulary PCs Peter Hunt and Gemma Kirby worked alongside the Museum of London Archaeology to identify the vases and where they came from.

Police eventually carried out a raid on Vessey's Oxfordshire narrowboat home and he was arrested, Bath Magistrates Court heard.

Andrea Edwards, prosecuting, said the crime 'cast suspicion over other archaeologists' and led to the loss of potentially significant historical evidence.

The two PCs at the centre of the investigation have since presented two of the recovered vases to museum archaeologist Bruno Barber and Roman Baths manager Stephen Clews.

The third vase is to follow.

After further examination in London the vases will eventually be returned to the Roman Baths Museum.

The vases, also known as Bartmann jugs, were traditionally used to protect against witchcraft.

They originated particularly from the Cologne region of modern Germany.

They were often decorated with a bearded face mask on the lower neck and came in a variety of sizes.

They are named Bellarmine vases after Catholic cardinal Robert Bellarmine who was a fierce opponent of Protestantism in Germany and the low countries.

It is unclear why his name became associated with the vases, but it may be connected to his anti-alcohol stance as the jugs were often used to store drink.

Roman Baths manager Stephen Clews said: 'These vases are very important to us because we don't have many objects and artefacts from medieval Bath that give us a better picture of that period in the city's history.'
