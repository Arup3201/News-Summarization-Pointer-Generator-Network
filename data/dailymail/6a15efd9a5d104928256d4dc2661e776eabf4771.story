Sweet tooth: Mel Giedroyc revealed that she puts on three quarters of a stone every year when she presents the Great British Bake Off

Resisting the temptation of sweet treats can be difficult at the best of times.

But if you work on a cookery programme, surrounded by freshly baked goods, it seems saying ‘no’ is almost impossible.

Mel Giedroyc revealed yesterday that she puts on three quarters of a stone every year when she presents the Great British Bake Off.

The 45-year-old, who hosts the culinary contest with fellow comic Sue Perkins, admitted gorging on cakes, bread and quiche.

And with the aroma of up to 12 tasty offerings being baked at once in the early stages of the competition, it is easy to understand why.

Miss Giedroyc said yesterday: ‘I’ve put on a good 11lb every series. The first couple of episodes it’s, “No thank you, not for me”.

'Cut to the semi-final and we’re hoofing up whole quiches.’

In an interview with the Radio Times, she revealed the BBC2 show’s production team had invested in heated belts to prevent judge Mary Berry from getting too cold, but added that the devices helped to ‘keep your stomach in’.

The programme, which is in its fourth series, is recorded in a tent in the grounds of Harptree Court, Somerset, and was last year marred by terrible weather, forcing the crew to come up with inventive ways of dealing with the cold.

Miss Giedroyc said: ‘When we first started filming, in April, it was freezing so our main concern was to keep Mary Berry warm. She had four thermal layers on and two water bottles down the trousers.

‘This year we discovered these marvellous heated belts called “hot trusses”. I was a big fan. They keep your stomach in as well, which is useful as the series goes on.’

They are stodgy and sticky and most definitely not for dieters.

Thanks to the recession, old-fashioned puds like jam roly-poly are back on the menu at mealtimes.

Demand for school dinner-style dishes has rocketed as families turn to comfort over style – driven by our economic woes and the latest restaurant trends for retro desserts.

A report by Trade magazine The Grocer yesterday revealed that sales of traditional puddings like spotted dick have climbed 42 per cent in a year.

The latest data on the UK’s £169million a year hot puds market shows that bread and butter pudding is up 15.2 per cent while crumbles have enjoyed growth of 13.2 per cent. Supermarket chain Asda has seen a 9.4 per cent rise in sales of puddings.

The Grocer said: ‘Billy Bunter would be proud. Britain is rediscovering the kind of traditional, school dinner-style puddings that gave him his figure. Downturn-driven nostalgia and comfort-eating are clearly playing their part.’

Paul Watmore, of food manufacturer Ambrosia, said ‘proper puddings’ are emotionally satisfying in a way that a yoghurt can never be.

Miss Berry, 78, revealed another downside to sampling food on the show, saying she has grown sick of cake. 

But she need not worry about the impact on her waistline, for she chooses clothes that are extra roomy to allow for layering.

She was praised for her style when she wore a Zara floral bomber jacket last year, but writing in the Mail yesterday, she said she only chose it because there was ‘lots of room under there for warm layers’.

‘I get immensely cold while filming as the wind blows through the break in the side of the tent, so the crew always get me long-sleeved thermal underwear,’ she said.

Not only that – she also keeps two hand warmers in her jeans back pockets.
