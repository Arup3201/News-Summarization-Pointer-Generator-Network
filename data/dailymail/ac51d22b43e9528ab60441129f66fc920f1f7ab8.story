Europeans are taking full advantage of their holiday entitlement as they enjoy far more time away from work than their peers on other continents, research has revealed.

Employees in Europe earn nearly twice as many paid days of annual leave than their counterparts in Asia-Pacific and North America, who appear to be wedded to work, a study says.

But while Europeans earn an average of 28 days off, UK employees receive an average of 26, while those in the US were given just 15 days off in the past year.

Time to relax: American workers took advantage of 14 of the 15 days of paid leave they were offered

UK residents take an average of 25 of 26 days off but 75 per cent said they feel 'very or somewhat' deprived

And it appears workers in Denmark, France, Germany and Spain are best off.

They are treated to 30 days of holiday entitlement every year and residents of all four countries say they have taken every day given to them, according to Expedia's annual vacation deprivation study.

UK residents, meanwhile, take an average of 25 of 26 days. But Britons want more time off as 75 per cent of those polled said they feel 'very or somewhat' deprived when it comes to their holiday entitlement.

In comparison American workers took advantage of 14 of the 15 days they were offered – an uptick from 2013 when US employees were offered 14 days and only took 12.

But only 54 per cent of those polled in the US said they feel 'very or somewhat' deprived.

The study found that Brits are the least likely to cancel or postpone their holiday plans because of work commitments, as only 24 per cent have done so – half of the global average of 50 per cent.

When it comes to taking a holiday in the first three months of the year, those in the UK feel the most comfortable, second only to Denmark, Expedia said.

Sixty-one per cent of Brits say they would switch jobs if it offered more holiday time and a further 33 per cent would prefer more time off than a pay raise.

Expedia asked Brits what they would give up for a week for an extra week off:

And it appears Brits would go to extreme lengths just to receive more time away from work.

They are the most willing in the world to give up showering for a week in exchange for an extra week’s holiday, according to the study.

Fifty per cent said they would swear off junk food if it meant more time away from work, while 48 per cent said they would unplug from social media.

A further forty-three per cent said they would give up booze for a week. 

Just 28 per cent would be willing to give up a week of sex. 

Elsewhere in Europe, Italians take 21 of 28 days of paid annual leave that they receive, the Dutch take 24 of 25 and the Irish take 21 of 22.

According to the study, there are varied reasons why people do not use all of their days off.

Nineteen per cent said their work schedule 'does not allow for it', while 18 per cent choose to bank or carry them over to next year.

Eighteen per cent said they allow some of their holiday time to expire due to a lack of money and a further 16 per cent said they forego a holiday because it is too difficult to co-ordinate.

Expedia surveyed nearly 8,000 employed adults in 24 countries across Asia-Pacific, Europe, North America and South America.

It revealed a sharp disparity in holiday behaviour across continents.

In Asia-Pacific, United Arab Emirates workers are given – and take – a full 30 days off each year, but their peers spent less time away from work.

Nineteen per cent of the survey's respondents said their work schedule does not allow for time off

UAE employees take twice the number of days off as their nearest peers as workers in Asia-Pacific were offered a median number of 19 days off and took only 14.

Even though they receive all of that time off, 73 per cent of respondents from UAE said they feel 'very or somewhat vacation deprived'.

Thai workers are the most deprived as they receive just 11 days of holiday entitlement, although the study's true 'winner' was South Korea, where people took only seven of 15 available days off.

Eighteen per cent said they allow some of their holiday time to expire as they have limited travel funds

Andy Washington, managing director of Expedia.co.uk, said: 'The vacation deprivation study looks at holiday habits across several different continents. While habits differ, the emotional impact of holiday does not.

'Somewhere between 80 and 90 per cent of people worldwide say that holidays make them feel happier, better rested, closer to their family, less stressed, and more relaxed.'

He added: 'These are all emotions that correlate to a productive employee. So it's almost paradoxical: spend more time away from work, and you might just be a better performing employee.'
