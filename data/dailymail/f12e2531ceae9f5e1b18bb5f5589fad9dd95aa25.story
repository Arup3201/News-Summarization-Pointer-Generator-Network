They reckon the average adult receives at least two unwanted presents at Christmas.

So perhaps it should come as no surprise that thousands have ended up on auction websites over the last few days.

What might be particularly upsetting for the giver, however, is that some of them haven’t even been unwrapped.

A blind auction: One eBay seller has put her unwanted Christmas presents from her ex-boyfriend on eBay - still unwrapped

More than 3,000 rejected gifts from ex-partners, mother-in-laws, and other relatives have been listed on eBay since Christmas.

Many of the items listed are unopened – which means those bidding on the goods are taking a gamble on what’s inside.

Buying a surprise: Bidders for the unwrapped presents have to take a gamble on what's inside (pictured posed by model)

One scorned lover listed seven neatly-wrapped presents from her ex-boyfriend in a three-day auction.

‘Came home from spending Christmas with my parents to find these left under my tree from my now ex-boyfriend, he also left his house key,’ eBay seller xjabekinsx posted.

‘7 unwanted, unopened Christmas presents. I want nothing to do with him or what he has to say or give me. More than likely the usual jewellery, perfume, make-up.

‘I know for sure one is from Debenhams as I saw the bag when he’d been shopping, feels like a clutch bag/purse of some sort.

‘Treat yourself to a surprise or a present for a friend/family member. My loss is your gain.’

Another woman listed three neatly-wrapped and unwanted gifts from an ex-partner in a blind auction.

The eBay member, treasure*seaker, said: ‘It’s a one day auction as I just want them gone. I have no idea what’s in them but they are from a scumbag ex who thinks presents will win me over!!’

She added: ‘Needless to say, he’s wrong. Must have been wrapped by someone else as he’s not clever enough to have done them.’

Some cash-strapped users decided to flog secret Santa gifts to earn money. ‘Budget had to be under £20 but over £5,’ one user posted. ‘I have no idea what they contain only that they are for me.’
