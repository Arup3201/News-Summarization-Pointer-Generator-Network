Zesty: Old Bay seasoning will be added to the Filet-O-Fish's tartar sauce from Monday

McDonald's are banking on beloved Old Bay seasoning to bring new life to one of their staple sandwiches.

From Monday, the popular Maryland seafood spice - which has a Sriracha sauce-like following, particularly in the Mid-Atlantic area - will be added to the tartar sauce of the fast good giant's Filet-O-Fish.

The idea was developed by McDonald's franchisee in - where else? - Baltimore.

Store owner Mark Furr said he came up with the idea because so many customers added Old Bay to the fried fish burger, and so he pitched the idea to his head office.

'We know that Old Bay is as popular as salt and pepper on our tables here in Baltimore,' Mr Furr told The Baltimore Sun.

'McDonald's is extremely excited to be able to deliver a true, local taste to our customers.' 

Nearly 700 McDonald’s locations in Maryland, Virginia, Washington, D.C., Delaware and West Virginia will offer Filet-O-Fish with Old Bay tartar sauce. 

The limited-time-only offering is an official partnership between McDonald's and McCormick and Co., the Maryland company that makes Old Bay.

The seasoning was named after the Old Bay Line, a passenger ship line that plied the waters of the Chesapeake Bay from Baltimore to Norfolk, Virginia, in the early 1900s.

It began as a spicing for bushels of blue crab, with the main ingredients of mustard, paprika, celery salt and bay leaves.

Old favorites: The Filet-O-Fish has been a McDonald's staple since 1962, while Old Bay seasoning has a cult following in the Mid-Atlantic, where it is added to almost everything 

However, for many, it has become a necessity that can be sprinkled on just about anything, from popcorn and potato salad to even beer and doughnuts.

The Old Bay Filet-O-Fish will hit participating stores on February 16. 

Of course, locals seem to be all for it. 

'It makes perfect sense to spice up the Filet-O-Fish with Old Bay, especially around the Mid-Atlantic,' Chesapeake business owner John Shields told Baltimore Magazine.

'McDonalds tried going locavore a number of years ago on the Eastern Shore with the addition of a crab-cake sandwich. 

'Not so good, and it didn't last long. But Old Bay and Filet-O-Fish? How could it go wrong?'

The Filet-O-Fish has been around since 1962 and was created by Lou Groen, a McDonald's owner in Cincinnati, Ohio.
