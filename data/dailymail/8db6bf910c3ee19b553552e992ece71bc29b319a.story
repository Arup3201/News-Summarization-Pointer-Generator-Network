Amir Khan will give Floyd Mayweather Jnr until the end of the week to agree to fight him.

The Bolton welterweight had been confident that his dominant victory over Devon Alexander last month would set him up for the Las Vegas mega-fight.

But he has grown frustrated after his efforts to negotiate a deal with the best boxer in the world drew a blank.

‘I want to fight in May and I want the Mayweather fight but it’s not getting any closer,’ Khan admitted to Sportsmail.

‘I’ve answered all the things Mayweather wanted me to do. He wanted me to fight at welterweight, I did that; he wanted to do a vote [to see who he would fight], I won the vote; he wanted me to beat a top guy in the division and I gave Devon Alexander a beating he’d never had before.

‘There is a lot of money in a fight with me, not just in America, but he’s trying to avoid me. He’s avoiding two names in boxing, Manny Pacquiao and Amir Khan.

‘Mayweather wants to keep his ‘0’, he doesn’t want to take the big fights. If he’s not fighting the top guys but is fighting guys who are over the hill or not at their peak, he’s going to be undefeated.

‘One thing about me is I’ve fought guys at their peak and who have been dangerous. I didn’t have to fight them but I did. Losing doesn’t make you a bad fighter, losing shows how good you are if you come back from those losses.

‘It’s a waiting game, I’ve given his team five days. I need to know this week because I need to start training.’

Should Mayweather look elsewhere for what he has said will be the penultimate fight of his illustrious career, Khan will turn to his former training partner Pacquiao or British rival Kell Brook.

The Filipino is also desperate to face Mayweather while Brook is set to return in March after recovering from being stabbed in Tenerife last August.

‘If Mayweather doesn’t take the fight then maybe the Pacquiao fight will be more interesting for me,’ Khan said.

‘We’ve sparred and trained together, we are friends and it would be a good fight. I have youth on my side and I’m a smart fighter. I’ve improved since I’ve been with my new trainer but Manny is the same fighter he was five years ago.

‘The thing with Kell Brook is that he hasn’t fought since he was stabbed. He wants to have a warm-up fight then have a big one.

‘I don’t think it will happen soon but it could happen towards the end of the year. It’s a fight that interests me.’
