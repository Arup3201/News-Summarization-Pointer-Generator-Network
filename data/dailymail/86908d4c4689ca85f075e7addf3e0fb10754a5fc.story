Up to 2,000 British jihadists have travelled to Syria and Iraq to join terror group ISIS, a Labour MP has warned. 

Young British Muslims are flocking to the war-torn countries to fight for the extremist group after being radicalised online and by softer groups, Khalid Mahmoud said. 

The real number of Britons who have joined ISIS since it begun waging war in the Middle Eastern countries is significantly higher than has been revealed by the government, he added.

The number of British jihadis who have gone to Syria and Iraq to join ISIS fighters is significantly higher than what is being revealed, an MP has said 

Previously it was claimed an estimated 500 Brits had travelled to Syria and Iraq to join ISIS. 

But Mr Mahmoud said hundreds more had been radicalised. 

'The official figures are a huge understatement,' the MP for Birmingham Perry Barr said. 

'The true figure for British radicals in Syria and Iraq is closer to 2,000,' he told the Sunday Mirror, adding that the number was 'still rising'. 

'Some are being radicalised online. People are still going out with the charities and being radicalised once they are shown.'

His comments come after Boris Johnson revealed thousands of terror suspects were under close observation across the UK. 

Of the estimated 500 who had gone to Syria and Iraq, around half are thought to have returned to Britain. 

Just 60 of those suspects have been arrested.  

Yesterday he said the capital was 'very, very concerned' about the situation, with the terror alert being raised several times in recent weeks. 

Five men in their twenties were arrested at a west London address on Friday on suspicion of terror offences. 

Last month eleven men were detained under similar charges following dawn raids across the capital and in Stoke. Most were released on bail.
