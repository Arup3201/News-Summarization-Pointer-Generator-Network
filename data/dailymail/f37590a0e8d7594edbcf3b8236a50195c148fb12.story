He had just been dematerialised in the Tardis – and so, by the look of it, had his suit.

For as Prince Charles toured the Doctor Who set yesterday, his jacket showed the clear signs of a running repair just below the left pocket.

His spokesman was keen to scotch rumours that the Anderson and Sheppard suit had been caught in the crossfire from a Dalek, insisting the patch was a ‘temporary repair’ that would be ‘repaired less visibly in due course’.

Royal tour: Matt Smith and co-star Jenna-Louise Coleman gave the future king and his wife Camilla a tour of the Doctor Who set in Cardiff where they met the famous Daleks

The Prince, known for having his 
expensive clothes patched and darned rather than throw them away, has 
been a Doctor Who fan since his teens.

And Doctor Who has a new adversary of royal proportions after the Prince of Wales lent his voice to one of the Daleks.

Charles tried his hand at being a sci-fi baddie during a visit to the BBC’s studios in Cardiff today.

Using
 a microphone plugged into a voice modulator, he uttered the Daleks’ 
famous 'exterminate' catchphrase - leaving the show’s writer Stephen 
Moffat thoroughly impressed.

He said: 'I haven’t thought about how I could weave a meeting between the Doctor and the royal family. But Prince Charles’s attempt at being a Dalek was great.

'There would be a part in the show for him if he wanted it.'

According to actor Matt Smith, who is due to stand down as the current Doctor, the Prince has been a secret fan of the show since he was 15.

Smith and co-star Jenna-Louise Coleman gave the future king and his wife Camilla a tour of the show’s set in Cardiff.

As well as getting to grips with a sonic screwdriver, the Prince stepped inside the famous Tardis.

The qualified helicopter pilot got to grips with its controls, while the Duchess of Cornwall pulled a lever to activate it.

Smith said: 'The Prince was lovely and a charming bloke.

'He took quite an interest in the Tardis’s controls and asked a lot of questions about it.

'He told me and Jenna that he’d been a big fan of the show since he was 15 - which we didn’t know.

Impressed: Prince Charles was given the thumbs up by actor and sound technician Nicholas Briggs, who voices the Daleks

'The other thing which stood out for me is he had fantastic shoes.

Smith joked: 'He’s got the makings of a future Doctor!'

Also giving the Prince the thumbs up was actor and sound technician Nicholas Briggs, who voices the Daleks.

The Lyndhurst-born performer, who began practising Dalek voices at the age of five, said: 'The Prince has got a history of performing and has done stuff with The Goon Show previously, so he really stepped up to the plate.

'Apart from a couple of giggles at the end, he did really good.'

The
 royal couple were also shown around the props department, chatting with
 set decorator Adrian Anscombe, who handed the Prince a sonic 
screwdriver.

'He got it to work first time, which doesn’t usually happen,' he said.

'As it’s a custom-built prop it can take a bit of getting used to but the Prince has the knack.'

Charles also came face-to-face with some of the show's other famous monsters - such as a Cyberman and a weeping angel.

Following
 the visit - which had BBC staff and journalists chuckling throughout - 
the Prince then toured the new headquarters of his charity Prince's 
Trust Cymru and met with volunteers and youngsters.

A Clarence House spokeswoman said Charles was very passionate about the organisation.

'The
 new Prince's Trust Cymru headquarters will support 3,500 vulnerable 
young people across Wales this year, giving them the skills and 
confidence to turn their lives around and move into jobs.

'It's 
significant because in Cardiff alone, more than one in four young people
 (30 per cent) are struggling to find a job (Office for National Statistics).

'The
 Prince's Trust Enterprise programme is celebrating its 30th birthday 
this year.

'It has helped 80,000 young people become their own boss since
 1983.

'It's worth noting that three in four young people on Prince's Trust programmes move into work, education or training.'

During the official opening, Charles addressed young people, staff, volunteers and supporters of The Prince's Trust.

He said: 'I hope some of you here 
today are beginning to benefit in a small way and I am also incredibly 
proud of the difference the Trust can make to so many lives.'

One of the young people who met the Prince was 27-year-old Sarah Hillier, from Pontypool.

She is about to launch a custom-made teddy bear business with support from the Trust.

She presented Charles with a bear created for his soon-to-be-born grandchild.

Mrs Hillier decided she wanted to run her own business after running a successful cafeteria at her partner's workplace.

She had to leave when her husband was made redundant and she found herself unemployed.

But her entrepreneurial spirit meant 
she was determined to find an idea that would work, and then her 
nine-year-old daughter gave her just that - custom made teddy bears.

Describing the bear she created for 
the Duke and Duchess of Cambridge's baby, she said: 'The bear is one of 
my favourite designs and I have chosen a soldier's outfit for it. I just
 hope this little bear is fit for a prince - or a princess!'

The charitable theme also continued 
for Camilla - who earlier in the week threw a tea party for seriously 
ill children - as she visited the Emmaus Charity shop in Porthcawl, 
Bridgend.

It supports homeless people by giving them accommodation and work experience in a bid to turn their lives around.

And after freely chatting with service users, Camilla then paid a visit to Cowbridge Physic Garden Trust.

A Royal spokeswoman added: 'The 
tradition of physic gardens stretches back a number of centuries. Known 
originally as "apothecaries gardens", many monasteries and large estate 
mansions had physic gardens where plants were grown for cooking, healing
 and dyeing wool and fabric.

'They were also known as kitchen gardens or 
potagers.'

Later in the afternoon rural champion
 Charles met staff and local farmers during a visit to the Farmers' 
Co-operative Shop in Treharris, Merthyr Tydfil. The collective, known as
 Cig Mynydd Cymru (Welsh Mountain Meat), specialises in the Welsh Black 
beef from cattle raised on the members' farms & South Wales Mountain
 lambs.

And completing an action packed day, the Prince headed to Ebbw Vale - where the Queen was met with a rapturous welcome during her Jubilee tour last year.

He paid a visit to the offices of education charity Teach First, of whom he is a patron. Teach First, which launches in Wales in in September, aims to increase the number of teachers from less well off backgrounds.

It has been given a three year contract by the Welsh Government and officials hope it will see 150 trainee teachers recruited on to the programme.

The Royals' tour of Wales continues tomorrow - with Camilla taking the lead with the day's engagements in Swansea.

Meeting the locals: Charles and Camilla visit Wales every year for a week. They have done since 2008 and stay at their holiday home Llwynywermod in Myddfai, near Llandovery, Carmarthenshire

The couple spend one week in July every year in he principality since 2008, which sees them stay at their holiday home Llwynywermod in Myddfai, near Llandovery, Carmarthenshire.

Town council member Nigel Burgess said locals now viewed the Prince as of one of their own.

'It's not only put us and local good causes on the map, but it's given us a tremendous sense of pride,' he added.

'It means all the more because this is supposed to be the Prince's holiday - but he's never put his feet up and locked himself in his holiday home.

'He's always got involved.'
