Tragic: L/Cpl Christopher Roney was described as the 'ultimate warrior' by military colleagues

A US helicopter gunship killed a British soldier in Afghanistan after being ordered to attack by officers who had misinterpreted grainy images from a drone aircraft.

Yesterday, coroner Derek Winter condemned ‘mistakes and failures’ by ‘unprofessional’ commanders that led to the friendly fire strike on the British patrol’s base – and questioned why officers had not understood the information and aborted the attack.

Troops from the 3rd Battalion The Rifles were in a firefight with insurgents in Sangin in December 2009. Unknown to them, senior British officers were watching the drone’s grainy images from the safety of Camp Bastion, about 30 miles from the battle at Patrol Base Almas.

The officers, however, had mistaken the soldiers’ mud-walled compound for the enemy’s lair.

Lance Corporal Christopher Roney, 23, a married father of one, suffered fatal head injuries when the US Apache gunship swooped in and opened fire with its 30mm chain guns, firing about 200 rounds of ammunition.

The soldier, from Sunderland, was flown to Camp Bastion but died the next day. Eleven of his comrades were also wounded.

After a five-day hearing in the soldier’s home town, the coroner condemned a string of errors that led to the death of Lance Corporal Roney.

Mr Winter said: ‘The deployment and use by friendly forces of attack helicopters was done in circumstances that ought to have been assessed by them to conclude sooner than they did that their target was not an enemy force and that the attack should  be aborted.’

He also blamed the fact that Patrol Base Almas was not marked on military maps and that British commanders insisted there were no friendly forces in the vicinity.

Case to answer: L/Cpl Roney's widow Lorna and brother William said the Ministry of Defence should be 'held accountable for their actions'

He concluded: ‘Lance Corporal 
Christopher Roney died as a consequence of assumptions made, mistaken 
beliefs and cumulative failures by friendly forces.

‘They had misinterpreted the imagery, 
and rather than observing what they interpreted as an insurgent location
 they were in fact viewing Patrol Base Almas, and used this information 
to guide the helicopter crews.

‘Misplaced assumptions and beliefs became fact, and opportunities to reflect and change a course of events were not taken.’

Drone aircraft are unmanned 
reconnaissance planes that remain in the air for many hours relaying 
images to frontline commanders. They are piloted by remote control using
 video screens, sometimes from as far away as a US military base in 
Nevada.

Mr Winter said the conduct of soldiers at Patrol Base Almas had been ‘extremely courageous and exemplary’.

He added: ‘They were professional and 
remained true to their training and procedures, factors that undoubtedly
 saved the loss of further lives in the face of adversity.

Corporal Christopher Roney

‘Unfortunately, the same could not be said of some others who were not at Patrol Base Almas when they came under pressure.’

In a statement to the inquest, Lance 
Corporal Roney’s family accused the Army and  Ministry of Defence of 
negligence and trying to cover up the severity of the incident.

It said: ‘The “fog of war” were the 
words used by the MoD, instead of saying what should have been said: 
negligence, plain and simple.

Major Timothy Harris also gave evidence at the inquest earlier this week

‘This has upset the family 
considerably and has given the impression that Christopher and his 
injured comrades meant very little to the MoD.’

An MoD spokesman said: ‘This tragic 
incident occurred in a highly challenging and fast-moving environment. 
All of those involved acted with the best intentions to assist their 
comrades, but tragically mistakes were made.

‘Comprehensive investigations have been conducted and key lessons identified.’
