The officer who left an Indian man paralyzed was responding to a call reporting a suspicious man in the neighborhood who was not seen breaking any laws.

A caller said a 'skinny black guy' with a toboggan hat was walking in the neighborhood and peering toward garages, recordings show, in the Madison, Alabama neighborhood.

Sureshbhai Patel was taking a walk in his son's neighborhood when Officer Eric Parker arrived, and then body checked him, leaving him now paralyzed.

Horrific: This is the moment Sureshbhai Patel, 57, was appredended on the sidewalk in Madison, Alabama

Brutal: Madison Police Officer Eric Parker cannot communicated with Mr. Patel and decides to body slam him onto the ground to incapacitate him

Seriously injured: Officer Eric Parker tries to pick up Mr. Patel, but they quickly realize that something has gone wrong and that he needs medical attention

Action: Officer Eric Parker has been fired over the incident, the department revealed on Thursday

This as video of the moment the Indian grandfather was slammed to the ground by the police officer and sent into paralysis has been released.

Newly-released dash-cam footage shows  Patel being thrown onto the sidewalk last Friday, just two weeks after he flew to the town from India to visit his 17-month-old grandson.

As Mr Patel undergoes surgery to his vertebrae, and his son files a lawsuit against the department, Madison Police Chief Larry Muncey confirmed Officer Parker, will be fired over the incident.

In the footage, released on Thursday, Mr Patel can be seen standing on a sidewalk in Madison with two officers, handcuffed.

After a few moments, one lifts him off the ground and slams his head into the floor. 

Despite being lifted up and dusted down, Patel could not stay on his feet - and after two operations no his vertebrae, remains partially paralyzed.

On Thursday Madison police confirmed one of the police officers captured in the footage has been charged with assault and will be fired.

Patel, who doesn't speak English, had only been in the country for two weeks. He had flown to Alabama to help take care of his 17-month-old grandson.

He is being treated in Huntsville Hospital and has limited movement in his right leg but his family fear he may never leave.  

Horrifying: Sureshbhai Patel has been left temporarily paralyzed after he was frisked and pulled to the ground

The 57-year-old, who had only been in the United States for two weeks, has limited movement in his right leg but his family fears he may never be able to leave the hospital 

Two officers initially responded to a complaint a 'suspicious person' was looking in garages around the neighborhood which residents say is usually quiet. 

The caller said they did not recognize Mr Patel and claimed he was walking on other people's property.  

When they arrived on the scene he said 'no English', and told them his son's house number.

The initial police report claimed Patel resisted arrest, prompting the officers to use brute force.

Apologizing for the incident, Madison Police blamed a 'communication barrier'.

Quiet suburb: Officers initially responded to a complaint a 'suspicious person' was looking in garages around the neighborhood. His attorney has claimed there was nothing suspicious 'other than he has brown skin'

Anger: His son Chirag, who paid for him to fly over from the small Indian village of Pij, said bringing his father over to the US was a dream. He was surprised at the attack as he believes its a good neighborhood

His son Chirag, who paid for him to fly over from the small Indian village of Pij, told AL.com: 'This is a good neighborhood. I didn't expect anything to happen.

'He was just walking on the sidewalk as he does all the time. They put him to the ground.' 

'It is a dream for me because I came from a very poor family and I worked so hard here.' 

Hank Sherrod, an attorney for the family, told the site: 'This is broad daylight, walking down the street. There is nothing suspicious about Mr. Patel other than he has brown skin. 

'This is just one of those things that doesn't need to happen.'

The police statement read: 'The subject began putting his hands in his pockets. Officers attempted to pat the subject down and he attempted to pull away. The subject was forced to the ground, which resulted in injury.' 

A GoFundMe account has been set up to help pay for Mr Patel's medical bills. The goal is to reach more than $25,000. 

Untouched: The clothes his father had laid out on his bed in preparation for his stay are left folded up
