A man was sent a five-figure care home bill for his late father just three days after his parent died.

Peter Hayden, 53, from Bournemouth, accused of council accountants of insensitivity after he was sent an invoice for £83,680.92 before he had even buried his 89-year-old father, Sidney.

The bill was for his father's care at the £700-a-week Highview Residential Home in Southbourne, and payment had been deferred until his father's bungalow had been sold.

Mr Hayden said: 'Dad died on the Tuesday, the council sent the letter on the Thursday, and I received in on the Friday.

'I couldn't believe the timing of it - you would have thought they could let us cremate him first.'

The letter began: 'We were sorry to hear of the death of Mr Hayden.  Please accept our sincere condolences.'

Immediately below the sympathetic message was a detailed invoice for £83,680 for Mr Hayden's stay at the care home from March 2010 to September this year. 

The council's letter ended by stating: 'We understand this is a difficult time, however...we look forward to receiving payment.'

Bournemouth Borough Council had previously agreed to fund Mr Hayden's care home fees until his home could be sold.

His son has accused the local authority for being insensitive about the timing of their demand for payment of the back-dated fees.

'Insensitive': Sidney Hayden's son, Peter, 53, received this bill from the council before his father's cremation

He said: 'They should have let a reasonable time pass before sending us a bill like that, but they either don't think or don't care.'

The invoice covered care for Mr Hayden senior from 23 March 2010 until 8 September this year, the day before Mr Hayden died. 

A spokesman for the council said they were now reviewing their debt recovery policy as a result of Mr Hayden's complaint.

Andy Sharp, head of adult social care for the council, said: 'Our sympathy and condolences go to Mr Hayden and his family for the loss they have suffered.

'In the light of Mr Hayden's complaint we are reviewing our policy in relation to debt recovery.'

He added: 'We apologise to the Hayden family for any distress the timing of this letter may have caused.'

Mr Hayden said: 'Dad died on the Tuesday and the council sent the letter on the Thursday - I couldn't believe it'
