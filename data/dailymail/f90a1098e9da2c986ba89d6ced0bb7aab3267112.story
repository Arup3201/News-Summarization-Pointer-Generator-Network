Apple has smashed its own records by selling nine million iPhone 5S and iPhone 5C handsets during the first three days - working out as 125,000 an hour, on average, or around 2083 a minute.

The tech giant also announced that 200 million devices are now running the iOS 7 software, despite download problems and divided opinion.

Last year's iPhone 5 sales topped five million during its opening weekend in September 2012, yet only one handset was available - as opposed to this year's two - and it wasn't sold in China from launch.

Last year's iPhone 5 sales topped five million during its opening weekend in September 2012, yet only one handset was available - as opposed to this year's two - and it wasn't made available in China immediately

Both new phones went on sale around the world from 8am on Friday and fans queued for days in London, pictured, Berlin, Beijing and Australia to be among the first to get their hands on the devices. However, demand was so high that some stores allocated all their stock before the shops officially opened

Hackers from German-based group Chaos Computer Club have become the first to hack into the new iPhone 5S.

A developer nicknamed Starbug created a copy of a print using a photograph and a homemade latex duplicate.

Following the launch, Apple shares rose more than 5 per cent to $493.47 in early trading on Monday.

This makes up in part for the loss the company suffered after the phones were unveiled at the start of September.

When Apple unveiled the iPhone 5 a year ago, it sold more than 5 million in the first three days after its launch.

'This is our best iPhone launch yet―more than nine million new iPhones sold―a new record for first weekend sales,' said Tim Cook, Apple’s CEO.

'The demand for the new iPhones has been incredible, and while we’ve sold out of our initial supply of iPhone 5s, stores continue to receive new iPhone shipments regularly.

'We appreciate everyone’s patience and are working hard to build enough new iPhones for everyone.'

An Apple statement added that remaining iPhone 5S orders will shipped 'in the coming weeks.'

Within hours of the devices going on sale, handsets were appearing on eBay for three times their retail value - around £2,000.

Handsets were also reportedly being sold on the street outside shops with significant markups.

'It's a great number,' said Colin 
Gillis, an analyst with BGC Partners. 'We have been saying they will be 
selling every 5S they can make and it looks like that is the case.'

Other figures in the Apple release claim iTunes Radio - a streaming service only currently available in the U.S - has reached 11 million unique listeners with the most listened to song being 'Hold On, We’re Going Home' by Drake.

The tech giant also announced that 200 million devices are now running the iOS 7 software, that features the new Control Centre pictured, despite download problems and divided opinion

The iPhone 5C handset, pictured, costs £469 for 16GB and £549 for 32GB when bought outright. The 16GB iPhone 5S handset costs £549 up to £709 for 64GB. Contract prices vary

Both new phones went on sale around the world from 8am on 20 September and fans queued for days in London, Berlin, Beijing and Australia to be among the first to get their hands on the devices.

However, demand was so high that some stores - including those in Liverpool and Cardiff - allocated all its stock before the shops officially opened.

Reports then came in that the official Apple store, as well as a number of third-party retailers, had sold out of the high-end iPhone 5S model.

Before the launch, the BBC discovered several networks admitted stock 'was severely limited in the UK', and predicted many customers would be disappointed. 

The handset will cost £469 for 16GB and £549 for 32GB when bought outright.

Although pre-orders for the 5C model began on 13 September, Apple did not allow the 5S to be reserved in advance.

An
unidentified network spokesman told the BBC they had been sent 'crates 
and crates' of the 5C, but were being 'drip fed' the more expensive 5S.

O2 is only selling the phones online, although customers can test demo models in stores.

A spokesman said this is the first time O2 has had to put its stock completely online because of the shortage.

Vodafone admitted not all of its stores across the country would have the phone on the day of launch.

Sources at U.S. networks added that they have received significantly fewer handsets than expected, too.

One told AllThingsD: 'We will have grotesquely unavailable inventory'.

Another
complained of 'extremely disappointing shipments from Apple, ' yet 
didn't think it would be a problem in the States because the iPhone 5C 
will be more popular.'

Reviews of Apple's new handsets have been mostly positive, but the prices of both were criticised before the launch for not being low enough to attract new customers.

Critics also claimed the addition of the fingerprint scanner was merely a gimmick, yet this was not enough to put customers off from buying them.
