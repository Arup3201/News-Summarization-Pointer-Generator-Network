A menacing photograph of a zip tie found inside the jeep into which teenage killer Austin Sigg bundled 10-year-old Jessica Ridgeway before murdering, raping and dismembering her has been released.

The stark image was part of a set of photographs of Sigg's Westminster, Colorado home used as evidence in his trial - including one which shows the wooden crawl space where the twisted teen hoarded some of the little girl's remains.

Other pictures released reveal Sigg's typical teenage bedroom, with a poster of The Beatles slapped against the wall - but this is the room where he concocted his plan to kill Jessica - a crime for which he will now spend the rest of his life behind bars.

Shocking: Zip ties found inside Austin Sigg's Jeep. Sigg used zip ties on Jessica Ridgeway when he kidnapped her on Oct. 5, 2012. He plead guilty to her kidnapping and death almost a year later

During the trial, Chief Deputy District Attorney Hal Sargent described Sigg's October 5, 2012 atrocities, including how he snatched Jessica off the street, lied to her as she begged to know whether she'd ever see her mother again, raped her and then strangled her before cutting up her body for his own sexual gratification.

'We have never seen a crime as heinous, depraved, whatever adjective we use to describe it....'Â  Sargent said.

'It's painful to imagine what he did 
to her in that time,' Sargent said before explaining how Sigg sexually 
assaulted the child, leaving her with horrific bruises then strangled 
her to death.

Sigg 
first tried to strangle Jessica with zip ties but he told police later 
that he didn't have 'enough leverage' so instead used his hands to 
strangle her for up to three minutes.

When he noticed she was still twitching, Sargent said Sigg filled a bathtub and forced her face into the scalding hot water.

'I don't want to go into all of the details of how he carefully, methodically dismembered her,' Sargent said during his November trial, but he did explain how he disposed of some of her organs but left her vagina, placing a cross in it.

Sigg, 18, who was sentenced last week to spend the rest of his life in prison, was obsessed with mortuary and forensic science and was convinced he could outsmart detectives who were searching for Jessica's killer.

Typical: Austin Sigg's bedroom in the Westminster home he shared with his mother and younger brother. Sigg pleaded guilty to kidnapping and killing 10-year-old Jessica Ridgeway

The Jefferson County District Court heard how he wiped the child's torso clean of DNA 
evidence after he strangled and dismembered her - then brazenly offered a
 sample of his own DNA to police when they took swabs from all of the 
men in Jessica's neighborhood in Westminster, Colorado.

Indeed, the court heard how the teen,
 who was 17 at the time of the murder, practiced zip-tying and 
restraining people on his own mother and slept in her bed night before 
was arrested for the child's killing.

Mindy
 Sigg seemed to laugh off her son's increasingly-troubling behavior, 
according to authorities. She joked to a friend about her his fixation 
on body decomposition and revealed that she helped the 17-year-old 
practice restraining people by letting him zip-tie her, police say.

Frightening: The backseat of Austin Sigg's Jeep. Sigg waited in the back seat of the Jeep before he kidnapped Jessica Ridgeway on Oct. 5, 2012

Police initially bungled the DNA test - 
losing the sample he handed over that matched him to both Jessica's 
murder and the attempted abduction of a jogger months earlier.

Despite
 Sigg's bizarre behavior and morbid fascination - his parents sent him 
to a Christian counselor in an attempt to set him right - Sigg had a 
girlfriend, at whose house at spent at least one night a week, it was revealed.

The Denver Post reveals a host of chilling new details about the crime that shocked the Denver suburb and horrified the nation last October.

Sigg
 snatched Jessica off the street as she walked home from school after he
 happened to spot her while he was out 'hunting' for a victim to kidnap 
and kill, he admitted to detectives.

Sentencing: Austin Sigg was been sentenced to life in prison in district court in Golden, Colorado, on Tuesday, November 19, 2013

Confession: Sigg speaks softly, slowly and calmly as he talks them through the abduction and murder of the ten-year-old

Jessica had been told about the threat that ultimately cost her her life - she wrote two reminders in a journal found in her desk at school: 'Do not play at the park alone' and 'Watch out for strangers!'

Despite Sigg's parents' initial concern about his fascination with decomposing bodies and violence, it soon became a laughing matter for his mother Mindy Sigg.

A friend told police that Mindy joked about his strange habits. Ms Sigg even said that she had practiced zip-tying and restraining someone with her son, according to authorities.

When Sigg snatched Jessica off the street, he immediately bound her hands and feet after throwing her into his SUV.

Jessica was confused and scared and wet herself. She kept asking if Sigg knew her mother, Sigg later told police.

'I would tell her that everything was going to be OK. I would just lie to her,' he told detectives.

Jessica's disappearance on her way home from school caused panic among 
parents across Denver, who feared their children were not safe

He
 told police he took Jessica back to his house and cut the ties that 
bound her. He sat her in front of a TV and let her watch cartoons.

He stripped her out of her wet clothes and made her change into a white t-shirt and black shorts from her closet.

He then told her to turn away and he strangled her to death with plastic zip ties.

He cut his hand in the process, as police photos show.

He
 dismembered her body and initially hid her remains in a pool house 
behind his mother's home. He stashed some of Jessica's belongings in a 
crawl space under the house.

He
 then dumped her remains in a garbage bag off a highway - but not before
 he wiped down Jessica's torso. Investigators had to swab the remains 
twice before they could even get a partial DNA sample.

When
 police came around to his house as part of a neighborhood-wide sweep to
 collect DNA samples, Sigg brazenly offered his up - thinking that there
 was nothing that could trace him back to the crime.

Horror: Police discovered Jessica's body in a field off of a highway on October 19, 2012. It had been severely dismembered by Sigg, who admitted he killed her

What
 he didn't know is that police had collected DNA from the attempted 
abduction of a jogger four months earlier - and that they also had DNA 
from the urine-soaked clothes that Sigg had stuffed in Jessica's 
backpack and dumped in town.

When
 local media reported that police had linked the two cases, Sigg told 
classmates at school that he felt 'tremendously' ill and 'wobbly,' the 
Post reports.

That night, he slept in his mother's bed. The next morning, he confessed his crime to Mindy Sigg - who called police.

After his arrest, he led police to the crawl space, where he had kept some of Jessica's remains. A crime scene photo shows a black plastic garbage bag.

Police found a broken black zip-tie in Sigg's Jeep SUV. They found bleach and black plastic trash bags on his porch - the same as Jessica's remains had been found in.

A photo of the basement where Sigg spent much of his time and his bedroom show a profound mess.

Dirty clothes and dirty dishes are piled high. A pair of samurai swords sit above his bed.

In his dirty laundry, police found a cross necklace - similar to one that they had found in Rideway's backpack.
