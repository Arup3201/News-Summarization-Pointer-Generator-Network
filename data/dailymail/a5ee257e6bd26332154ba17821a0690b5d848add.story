A 15-year-old girl who encouraged her autistic boyfriend to shave off his eyebrows, have sex with the family dog and walk across dangerously-thin ice on a frozen lake - all while filming him - has been sentenced to a maximum of six years in a state juvenile detention.

The unnamed teen, who was reportedly dating the boy, received the sentence in St Mary's County, Maryland on Thursday after previously pleading guilty to second-degree assault and displaying an obscene photograph of a boy.

She was arrested last month with a friend, 17-year-old Lauren Bush, after a classmate at Chopticon High School learned about the videos in which they allegedly tormented the boy.

Bush has been charged as an adult with first-degree assault, false imprisonment and child-pornography solicitation. She faces up to 80 years in prison if convicted - but her parents and lawyers are battling for her to be charged as a juvenile instead.

Bush, who allegedly held a knife to the boy's throat, is undergoing several weeks of psychological examinations at a state juvenile detention center, the Washington Post reported.

On Thursday, before the 15-year-old was sentenced, she had asked the judge to be placed in a community-based treatment program, rather than jail.

'I just feel a not-lockdown facility is going to be best for me,' the girl, dressed in a pink hoodie, said.

'Of course you do,' Judge Michael Stamm responded sarcastically, the Post noted.

He ignored her pleas for leniency and branded her treatment of the boy 'horrific'. He said she posed a danger to the community.

She will now remain at a secure juvenile facility until she is 21 - but she could be released before if authorities deem that her rehabilitation is progressing quickly, the Post reported.

The sentencing comes days after the 16-year-old victim said he wanted the charges against the girls dropped. He said he considers Bush and the 15-year-old girl, who was his girlfriend, to be his friends.

'It really makes me upset that my parents want to see them in jail,' he told the Washington Post in an earlier interview. 'Because I really like them.'

He said the girls never intended to kill him - even when they held a knife to his neck and led him to a frozen lake and persuaded him to fetch a basketball on the ice.

Minutes later, he fell through the ice and screamed, but the girls did nothing to help, he said. Afterwards, they wouldn't allow him to ride with them and he returned home wet.

'They put me in the trunk,' he said. 'They didn't want to get the interior wet.'

His parents, however, said they want Bush to be tried as an adult.

'My son is a staunch defender of his 
tormentors; itâ€™s embarrassing,' his father told the Post.

'He may be more disabled than I 
convinced myself that he was and maybe more lost than I realized. That's
 something I am going to have to deal with on a later day. Right now, I 
am trying to get justice for him and others like him.'

Their cruel treatment was uncovered after a fellow student heard about the videos and told school authorities.

On March 10, 
sheriff's deputies confiscated the younger girl's phone and both were arrested.

Sheriff Tim Cameron told ABC7 that the allegations leveled against the girls are among the most disturbing he has dealt with in his career.

'Who
 could harbor this ill will to do something so completely heinous?' said
 Cameron. 'I don't know. It's hard to fathom, really.'
