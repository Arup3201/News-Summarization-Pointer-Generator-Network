When Megan Seabolt spotted red marks on her 16-month-old son's leg after she picked him up from daycare last week, the boy's caretakers told her it was just a rash from a bug bite - nothing to worry about.

When the marks got worse and not better, the Gainesville, Georgia, mother took little Damon to the hospital, where doctors diagnosed him with second-and-third degree burns  on his leg and stomach and rushed him a intensive care at a burn unit.

Police have now arrested the owner of the daycare, Discovering Basics, as well as her daughter and one employee on charges that they refused to get treatment for Damon and then tried to cover up that the injury ever happened.

Little Damon suffered horrible second and third-degree burns on his leg, which daycare workers tried to pass off as a bug bite

Untreated: For eight hours, the 16-month-old languished without medical attention. His caretakers only slabbed ointment on his leg

For nearly eight hours on June 13, the boy languished without medical treatment and only topical burn ointment to treat the severe injuries he received, WSB-TV reports.

An attorney for Ms Seabolt says Damon could have scars for the rest of his life.

On Monday police arrested Discovering basics owner Minnie 'Sue' Dupree and daughter, Tara Miller, the daycare director. Last Friday, deputies also busted Eddye Pittmon, 55.

Pittmon and Miller are charged with child cruelty. Dupree faces a lesser charge, witness tampering, for allegedly trying to cover up her employees' actions.

Mike Weaver, Ms Seabolt's attorney, said he believe the burns could have come from a pot of boiling water that the daycare keeps to warm up bottles.

'When a baby is in childcare the whole point of the care part is for them to be taken care of,' Ms Seabolt told WXIA-TV.

'By the time I got to the hospital, there was no skin left on his leg.'

The Burn Center at Doctors Hospital in Augusta grafted skin onto the burns, though Damon has a long road to recovery.

Lawyers for Ms Pittmon denied that Damon was burned at the daycare and pointed the finger at Ms Seabolt - and the 30 minutes that elapsed between the time she picked him up and the time that she took him to the hospital.
