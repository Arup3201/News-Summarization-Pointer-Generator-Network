A former top polo player was accused yesterday of sexually abusing five girls aged eight and nine.

Simon McLaren-Tosh allegedly filmed himself molesting his young victims at his polo centre home last year.

McLaren-Tosh, 49, a former professional player who sits on the game’s global ruling body, the Hurlingham Polo Association, was charged on Sunday and was remanded in custody when he appeared in court yesterday.

In a case that will rock the polo world, police swooped on the married father of two after receiving a tip-off from police in Russia.

Officers from Thames Valley Police raided his home, seizing his phones and computers, Slough Magistrates’ Court in Berkshire was told yesterday.

Tina Flannery, prosecuting, alleged: ‘The sexual assaults were committed against young children aged eight years old.

‘The assaults were also photographed by him, he filmed himself committing the offences. There is a huge breach of trust.’

McLaren-Tosh, a former member of the Royal Berkshire Polo Club, is accused of five charges of sexual assault on a child under 13.

The offences are alleged to have happened on two occasions between April and August last year.

Wearing a navy blue fleece jumper, dark jeans and glasses, blond-haired McLaren-Tosh spoke only to confirm his name and deny all five counts when he stood in the dock yesterday.

Presiding magistrate Anne Brown remanded him in custody to appear before a judge at Reading Crown Court for a preliminary hearing next month.

McLaren-Tosh’s family home is at a polo centre and farm in the wealthy village of Maidens Green, near Warfield, Berkshire. He owns two businesses: Livery and Polo Management, which is based at his family home; Berkshire Classic Cars, which buys and sells collectable cars. 

The court heard that since the allegations emerged he has moved out of the family home, which he shared with his wife Louise and two children, and moved in with his parents at their farm in Devon.

McLaren-Tosh was arrested by Thames Valley Police after returning from a holiday to France last month and was then released on bail.

He was re-arrested and questioned by police on Sunday and then charged.

McLaren-Tosh plays off a polo handicap of two and now umpires matches. In 2000, when he was playing professionally, he was part of a team that won the Roehampton Trophy, the oldest polo trophy in the UK.  

McLaren-Tosh’s family home and business is set in huge grounds in Maidens Green. 

Yesterday a tractor and horse box could be spotted through the hedge but there were no staff or horses in the deserted grounds. 

Slough Magistrates' Court heard that Thames Valley Police launched an investigation into McLaren-Tosh, pictured, after they received information from Russian police about indecent images
