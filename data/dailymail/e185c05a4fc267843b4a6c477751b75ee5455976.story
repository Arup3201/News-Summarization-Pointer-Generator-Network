Microsoft has slashed the price of its Xbox One games console by $100 in a bid to become the living room gadget of choice and catch up to arch rival Sony.

However, in order to lower the price, Microsoft has dropped its revolutionary motion sensor Kinect from the cheapest bundle.

The new price of $399, the same as a PS4, begins June 9, and Microsoft says it is also allowing entertainment apps like Netflix to be used on both the Xbox One and the older Xbox 360 console without having to pay for an Xbox Live Gold membership, which costs $60 a year.

Although the Xbox One was a hit with some fans, it has been outsold by Sony's Playstation 4. Microsoft hopes the price drop will boost sales.

Microsoft said last month that sales of Xbox One had slowed to 1.2 million in the quarter through March, compared to the 3.9 million it sold in the holiday quarter.

The total of 5.1 million was behind Sony's 7 million in sales of the PS4.

Both launched in November.

The membership will continue to be required for multiplayer game mode, but it will also provide discounts on games and free games.

Phil Spencer, who was named head of Xbox in March, said unbundling Kinect was important to reaching more fans.

'Value is important,' he said in an interview.

'Making sure you have an opening price point that can reach as many people as possible is critical.'

Spencer added that it no longer made sense to reserve apps such as Netflix and YouTube to paying subscribers since such apps are widely available on DVD players and other Internet-connected devices.

It comes as the firm is moving into entertainment.

Weeks ago Yahoo and Microsoft both revealed plans to create their own TV shows in the ever-expanding battle for the living room.

Yahoo has unveiled plans for four shows, while Microsoft is believed to have 12 in development.

They will go up against Amazon, Hulu and Netflix, all of whom are also commissioning their own shows in a bid to change they way we watch TV.

Yahoo chief executive Marissa Mayer has unveiled plans to break into television-style original video with the launch of two original comedy series and an internet channel that will stream live concerts. The expansion makes Yahoo the latest technology company to mount a challenge to Netflix

Amazon last month unveiled a $99 TV box to take on Apple, Google and Roku - and it doubles as a games console.

At an event in New York the firm launched the Fire TV box, which runs a special version of Google's Android software.

The small box fits under a TV, and comes with a remote with a built in microphone for voice recognition.

It allows users to download films and TV shows, along with apps.

To play games, users can use a remote, or buy a separate game controller for $40.

Mike Frazzini from Amazon Games said each game will be priced like a phone app, costing on average $2.

Games available at launch will include Minecraft, driving game Asphalt 8 and first person shooter Sev Zero, created by the games studio double Helix Microsoft bought recently.

Microsoft has signed up comedians Sarah Silverman and Seth Green for its projects.

It hired former CBS boss Nancy Tellem to head up its new TV studio, which will produce shows to be watched on the firm's Xbox games console as well as its mobile devices.

The studio now has six series lined up - including a science-fiction thriller called 'Humans' about humanoid robot workers - and more than a dozen projects in development, according to Bloomberg.

Yahoo is seeking to order web series’ that will position it to compete with offerings from other streaming video goliaths in a bid to bolster advertising revenues.

The web portal is set to order four new shows with per-episode budgets of as much as a couple million dollars, a source told the Wall Street Journal.

CEO Marissa Meyer’s sweet spot appears to be half-hour comedies with 10 episode seasons ‘led by writers or directors with experience in television,’ the paper reported.

Sagging revenues and four straight 
quarterly losses have created a sense of urgency among executives 
looking to have deals lined up before a major advertising conference 
later this month.

Actress Sarah Silverman is among those believed to have signed up to Microsoft's TV shows. It is believed the firm has six projects approved, with a dozen in development.

‘They want to blow it out big time,’ said the Journal’s source.

Meyer believes the key to upping the advertising rate ante is adding television-caliber content to compete with the likes of Amazon, Hulu and Netflix, a person close to the negotiations explained.

‘They're looking at the same type of shows that Netflix and Amazon are eyeing,’ said the source.

Having those shows lined up by the April 28th ‘NewFront’ event – in which internet companies pitch their advertising dollar worthiness similar to the way television networks present their primetime lineups – is key to that strategy.

Yahoo is competing against an ever-increasing number of cable networks and other sites for the original content and viewers’ eyeballs, but is fixated on the potential premium advertising rates charged for video has for boosting the bottom line.

Recent successes such as ‘House of 
Cards’ and ‘Orange is the New Black’ helped drive a subscriber surge of 
2.3million in the fourth quarter of 2014 alone, the company announced earlier this year.

Yahoo currently trails far behind other online video providers. Financial terms of Yahoo's deals to license the new series weren't disclosed. However, Yahoo doesn't plan to charge viewers to watch the series

Yahoo trails far behind other streaming providers, but it wants a piece of that pie, and the revenues that could be reaped through international syndication deals, according to the Journal.

The ability to stream video from Amazon, HBO Go, Hulu and Netflix straight to televisions through Blu-ray players, game consoles, set-top boxes like Roku and other devices has no doubt fueled their growth, as has the ability use apps specially designed for handheld devices.

Amazon Prime has also added multiple scripted and animated shows to its subscription-based Prime service, and only sweetened the deal with the recently-released Fire TV box meant to stream the content directly on to televisions.

Vizio televisions currently use a Yahoo-based interface for apps, including direct video streaming competitors, to extend their usefulness – but it is not clear if the search giant would look to leverage that partnership.

Also available is the Yahoo Sceeen app, which allows users the ability to watch Yahoo videos on Apple handheld devices. A Yahoo Screen website is also available for those interested.

Yahoo declined to comment about it's video ambitions when reached by MailOnline.

'House of Cards': The Kevin Spacey-starring Netflix series has become the standard for online television shows

Yahoo is up against stiff competition without the ability to easily stream video content to televisions. Binge-watching has replaced appointment viewing, and web series have reached a level of critical acclaim with Kevin Spacey starring in ‘House of Cards.’

The site has produced original video series in the past, such as the Morgan Spurlock-directed ‘Failure Club’ reality show, and has also recently ramped up video production across its news and sports divisions. This is not an entirely new frontier.

Recent moves to hire veteran journalists Katie Couric and David Pogue, as well as a rumoured $300million acquisition of video provider News Distribution network have also hinted at Yahoo’s ambitions.

Meyer and chief marketing officer Kathy Savitt have reviewed more than 100 projects over the past few months, but are looking for shows that can hit the ground running, according to the Journal.
