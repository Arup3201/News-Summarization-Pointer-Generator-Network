Pornography is to be banned from public wi-fi networks by the end of the year, David Cameron’s children’s czar said last night.

Claire Perry said the move was vital to prevent children from stumbling across adult material when using wireless internet networks in places such as cafes and railway stations – or seeing others who may be downloading it.

But one of the country’s largest internet providers has threatened to throw a spanner in the works by warning that ministers’ plans to block porn from public wi-fi could be against the law.

BT was accused of ‘dragging its heels’ over an agreement to filter its public wi-fi services by raising at the last minute its concerns that it could open itself to legal challenges.

The company claims blocking adult material from stores which use BT public wi-fi could breach 2000 legislation which bans the interception of electronic communications.

Last year the Daily Mail revealed that coffee chain Starbucks, which uses BT, had failed to filter adult material from its free wi-fi – putting children of seeing obscene porn on other customers’ tablets or mobile phones. Starbucks has now imposed a filter.

But Mrs Perry, the Prime Minister’s children’s czar, said she was still hopeful that hardcore porn would be filtered out of all public wi-fi networks by the end of the year.

The six largest providers of public wi-fi – accounting for 96 per cent of coverage – have agreed to put adult content block in place.

High Street companies offering free wi-fi from one of the six companies, which includes BT, would then be encouraged to put the block in place to protect children using mobile phones and tablets like iPads.

These shops would be able to display a ‘family friendly’ logo so parents know their children will be safe.

Mrs Perry, Mr Cameron’s adviser on children, said: ‘I’m really pleased that the internet industry is committed to providing public wi-fi that is free of adult content. It is entirely appropriate and means that children can surf the web safely in thousands of different places.

‘Now we need to move fast in introducing family-friendly home internet filtering to make sure that our young people are not accessing violent and pornographic images.‘The terrible recent story of the teenage girl raped by boys who had become addicted to internet porn only underpins how important these changes are.’

Last month the Prime Minister hinted that action was on the cards when he said: ‘We are promoting good, clean, WiFi in local cafes and elsewhere to make sure that people have confidence in public WiFi systems so that they are not going to see things they shouldn’t.’

The web companies agreed to raise their game at the latest meeting of the UK Council for Child Internet Safety, which brings together children’s charities with ministers and the online industry.

However, no timetable has yet been set but it is hoped the blocks will be in place by the end of the year. The six firms are O2, Sky, BT, Virgin, Arqiva and Nomad.

And minutes of the meeting, held last month, reveal that BT is dragging its heels over the changes.

Anne Heal, the representative from BT Openreach, said: ‘There is considerable nervousness that filtering content could be regarded as intercepting data, and which could put providers in breach of the Regulation of Investigatory Powers Act 2000.’ The Act allows certain public bodiesto intercept data for national security reasons – but bans everyone else from doing so.

BT’s argument is that filtering web use without the user’s express permission could be regarded as the interception of data.

But children’s charities say the Act only applies to emails and other personal information, not the sites people are able to visit.

One campaigner present at the meeting said: ‘People were completely astonished at BT’s timidity. But equally the fact that the government seem to be dragging their feet hardly inspires confidence.’

BT also raised the possibility of charging companies which use its public wi-fi service extra for imposing a filter. They said it would be on a cost recovery basis, and that they would not make a profit.

But the campaigner said: ‘Filtering porn on wi-fi should be standard. Nobody should have to pay extra to do the right thing.

‘That’s how O2, Sky and Virgin do it. Yet there was a suggestion that BT were going to make it an optional, paid-for extra.’

A spokeswoman for BT said: ‘BT, along with other internet service providers, supports the objectives of the government and our customers for providing a family friendly internet through the deployment of filtering solutions for adult and pornographic content in the home and with our wi-fi partners.

‘We have merely sought clarification regarding the potential legality of a particular approach to intercepting content in order to ensure that our customers, employees and shareholders are not put at risk.’
