Lobster, once a delicacy restricted to high-end restaurants, is getting its claws into High Street takeaways and snack bars. 

The UK's appetite for it is at an all-time high due to its growing availability and low price. 

So-called lobster shacks, modelled on those in Maine, America, are springing up, serving the seafood in a roll for as little as £9. 

Simon King of Burger & Lobster, an expanding restaurant group, said despite problems keeping the shellfish alive in shop tanks, they will become more commonplace on menus across the country.

Analysts are expecting lobster to be available at a lower price than ever this year as its popularity continues to grow.

On its opening day, the 240-seat Burger & Lobster restaurant in Cardiff served about 200 customers at lunchtime alone.

Three new branches are planned in London for 2015, and the Burger & Lobster will open in Manchester this spring and Bath and Liverpool later in the year. 

'If you go back 20 years, people didn't have king prawns, now you can get them almost anywhere,' said Mr King.

'It's not going to be exactly the same with lobsters as keeping them alive is difficult, but we are still going to see lobster become more commonplace on menus.'

His restaurants charge £20 for a one-and-a-half-pound lobster, but rival chains are charging less for smaller lobsters.

Mr King said: 'The price point of lobster is dropping.'

Takeaways selling lobster rolls are making the delicacy even more affordable.

Fraq's Lobster Shack in London, modelled on those in Maine, America, charges £15 for a lobster roll, but nearby Smack's Deli is the cheapest at £9 for a large roll, similar in price to a gourmet burger.

Lobster has also gained new fans with discount supermarkets such as Lidl and Iceland selling whole frozen crustaceans for just £5.
