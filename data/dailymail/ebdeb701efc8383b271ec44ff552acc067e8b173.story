Gap year students must take all possible steps to ensure their safety following the murder of two UK medical students on a work placement in Malaysia earlier this month, travel organisation Abta has said. 

The warning was issued as thousands of gap-year travellers plan their adventures abroad.

The most popular type of gap year requested by school and college leavers for 2014/5 was work experience placements abroad, including teaching English as a foreign language, bar work and internships.

Abta communications head Victoria Bacon said: 'Doing plenty of research and talking to reputable gap year travel companies can help you decide what to do and where to go.'

Abta said that operators specialising in gap year travel had reported an increase in bookings over the last 12 months, with Australia the most-popular destination followed by Thailand, the United States, New Zealand and Peru.
