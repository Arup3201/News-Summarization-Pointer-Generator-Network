Prince William and Kate's tour to the US has led to a huge increase in online searches for New York hotels.

The Big Apple is an already popular destination around Christmas, but it seems the expectant parents have given an additional excuse for Brits to look for a last-minute excursion abroad. 

Hotels.com can reveal that searches to the Big Apple have increased 84 per cent since the couple landed, compared to the same time last year.

William and Kate's tour has encouraged Britons to research a Christmas break in New York City

Although the three-day tour focused on promoting British businesses and supporting diplomatic and charitable causes, the royals were able to fit in some holiday activities including a trip to Madison Square Garden to watch a basketball game and a reflective visit to the 9/11 memorial.

This isn't the first time a pregnant Kate has influenced Britons' travel habits.

Previous research shows travellers were inspired to head to Singapore following the rumour that the couple may have conceived while visiting the Asian country.
