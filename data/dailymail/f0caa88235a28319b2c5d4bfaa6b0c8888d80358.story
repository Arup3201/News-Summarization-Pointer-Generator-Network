World champion sprinter Richard Kilty has rejoined Linford Christie’s training group in a move he hopes will see him break the 10 second barrier for 100 metres for the first time.

Kilty, who won a surprise 60m indoor gold in Sopot last year, had been coached by the former Olympic Champion in 2012 but was forced to leave Christie after his Lottery funding was cut for a short time.

He relocated to Loughborough to work under Rana Reider but the American coach left British Athletics last year and Kilty, who has set his sights on becoming the first white Briton to break the 10sec barrier, will return to London to work with Christie.

‘Richard has made a sensible decision in the circumstances,’ said British Athletics performance director Neil Black, ‘He has a history of working with Linford and that group. James Ellington is going to be there as well. They need that hard work atmosphere.’

Kilty, nicknamed The Teeside Tornado, began the 2015 indoor season at the Glasgow International Match on Saturday but was disqualified for a false start.

‘It was a tragedy for him but stuff happens,’ said Black, ‘I think he dealt with it well. He is learning, developing and maturing as a person all the time and has more to come as an athlete.’

Black admitted there was a ‘reality check’ in store as the team who enjoyed the most successful European Championships in British history last year work towards the Beijing World Championships in August.

Olympic heptathlon Champion Jessica Ennis-Hill will almost certainly be among their number. The 28-year-old is working hard in the gym and on the track following the birth of her first baby, Reggie.

‘I truly think that she believes and wants to recapture that greatness,’ said Black, ‘She certainly knows it is not going to be easy, but I think there is a genuine desire to go back and see what she can do and do it again.’
