A teenager who was struck down with an agonising bowel condition says dancing has helped him to overcome his debilitating illness.

Macaulay Selwood, 17, was diagnosed with Crohn's two years ago and was so unwell that he was often left in agony on the floor unable to move.

But his determination to continue his promising dancing career gave him the spur he needed to battle through.

Lord of the Dance: Macaulay at his practice studio. He was diagnosed with Crohn's in September 2010 after collapsing in agony during a dance class

Recovery: 'Dancing has helped me overcome it (Crohn's). It kept me motivated'

Now the teenager from Bristol has made it to the finals of the Irish dancing world championships in Boston, USA, and is hotly-tipped for glory. He will then have a trial at the famous performing arts school, ArtsEd, in London.

At shows he has been compared with Riverdance star Michael Flatley while others have taken to calling him Billy Elliot, after the film character who overcomes the odd to becoming a dancing star.

Macaulay did ballet at college before focusing on Irish dancing for the world championships and works at Tesco to fund his passion. In 2010 he won the British and American national
championships and came second in the world championships.

But that September he suddenly started suffering from terrible stomach cramps.

'I was at a dance class and I fell to the floor screaming in agony,' he said.

He stopped going to school for eight weeks and his weight dropped two stone after he struggled to eat.

He was diagnosed with Crohn's, which is a bowel disease caused by inflammation of the lining of thedigestive system. It can cause painful symptoms, including abdominal pain and cramping, fatigue, recurring diarrhoea and weight loss.

High-flyer: Macaulay, from Bristol, hopes to win the Irish dancing world championships

Doctors were able to stabilise his condition with a series of injections and iron tablets

'When it comes on you can't do anything,' he said.

'I didn't end up eating because I was worried about the pain. It was pretty debilitating for me - I was scared, I thought my life was over.

'I was such a healthy kid - it was a shock when I got it because I'm so active. It was overwhelming for me, I thought my dance career was over. I didn't expect to be better now.'

The teenager, who has been dancing since he was six, was treated at Bristol Royal Hospital for Children, before continuing his treatment at Bristol Royal Infirmary.

Doctors were able to stabilise his condition with a series of injections and iron tablets.

He is now able to manage his condition and is able to perform at competitions again. He hopes to one day become a professional dance and join touring shows.

Macaulay said: 'Dancing has helped me overcome it - if it wasn't for dancing I wouldn't be as well now.

'It kept me motivated - because I wanted to get back to it. I didn't let it beat me.'
