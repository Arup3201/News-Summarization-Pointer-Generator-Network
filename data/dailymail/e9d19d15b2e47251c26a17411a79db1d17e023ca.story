John Galliano returned from fashion exile this evening to unveil his first collection in four years at London Collections: Men, and the fashion community lapped up his surreal creations.  

The designer's much-anticipated show for Maison Martin Margiela  was his first since he was fired from Dior in 2011, after a series of racist and anti-semitic offences.

The 54-year-old designer's friends and supporters including Kate Moss and husband Jamie Hince, Jefferson Hack, Manolo Blahnik, Burberry's creative director Christopher Bailey and Natalie Massenet of Net-A-Porter fame were in the front row  as he showcased his first couture collection for the Belgian brand.

John Galliano showed his new collection for Maison Martin Margiela at London Collections: Men this evening. It's the first show since he was found guilty of racist and anti-semitic abuse in 2011. The designer decided against an end-of-show bow but was pictured leaving the venue in a car after the show 

His flamboyant creations included a jumbo-sized devil's mask worn with a red swing coat and red rubber leggings and a ghostly wedding dress.

The fashion community took to Twitter in droves to share their views on the controversial comeback using the hashtag #MargielaMonday.

'A mixture of Belgian chic, Parisian couture and a Galliano wild streak this #MargielaMonday hasn't been a boring one!' tweeted Red magazine.

Meanwhile, fashion bible Harper's Bazaar wrote: 'The clothes could only have come from one man', then added, 'Surrealist fashion from John Galliano  #MargielaMonday'.

Editor of fashionista.com Lauren Sherman commented: 'Galliano’s demons were out there for all to see'. She commented, 'Many of the looks were like beautiful innards twisted outward, as if Galliano was using this collection to purge himself of his demons.'

Other creations included a high-collared, floor-length, red-velvet gown, which the model wore with futuristic eye make up and, in true Galliano style, skyscraper platforms. 

A black tasseled mini-skirt was worn with a structured jacket,  pulled off the shoulder and accessorised with a feather headpiece and tights that were half black and half white.

The house described the collection 'artisanal' and many of the clothes were embellished with bric-a-brac - junk metal jewellery, shells and beads decorated one leopard print leotard while a tunic dress was adorned with black plastic toy cars.

John Galliano was famous for his flamboyant end-of-show bows while at Dior, but the past few years have clearly had an effect on the designer - he skipped the catwalk and immediately left the venue in a waiting car when the show had finished today. 

Fashion blogger Simon Glazin told FEMAIL: 'The last four days of menswear fashion shows in the capital may as well never have happened - the comeback of John Galliano, after four disgraced years away from the fashion arena, has overshadowed it all. 

'The Dior days of Galliano was all about fantasy, about whimsical, extraordinary, unattainable, incredible couture. And this is what we saw from him today.'

'The name of the fashion house which he presides over is, essentially, immaterial. What Galliano does, translates. He does luxury and magnificence like no other,' he adds.

'Although the colour palette stuck to black, white and red, it was all about the detail. 

'Toy cars used at trims, shredded chiffon trailing behind models, clear plastic pockets, robot-esque faces on dresses and coats, shells, beads and pieces of mirror adorning the closing dresses.

'The dimensions Galliano created stayed true to both his and Margiela's avant-garde routes.

'Having said all this, pick some of the looks apart and you're left with wearable pieces: a black jacket, denim shorts and evening gowns.

'His comeback is a pure triumph.

'Welcome back John.'

Galliano was hired as creative director of Belgian brand Maison Martin Margiela in October after being sacked by Dior. 

The  designer was asked to leave his job at Dior after a damning video emerged of him telling a woman whom he thought was Jewish that he loved Hitler and that her parents should have been gassed.

He then allegedly ranted to an Asian man sitting with her: '****ing Asian b******, I'm going to kill you.' 

Two other women also complained to police about suffering anti-Semitic abuse at the hands of the designer.  

Face of Dior, Natalie Portman, was among those outraged by his remarks. 

At the time, the Oscar-winning actress said: 'In light of this video, and as an individual who is proud to be Jewish, I will not be associated with Mr Galliano in any way.

'I hope at the very least these terrible comments remind us to reflect and act upon combating these still-existing prejudices that are the opposite of all that is beautiful.' 

Dior owners LVMH cited a zero-tolerance policy on racism and anti-semitism and immediately gave the designer his marching orders. He was later charged in court and given two suspended fines totalling 6,000 euros (£5,250).

Since then, Galliano has undergone treatment for drugs and alcohol and worked briefly as a designer for New York fashion brand Oscar de la Renta in 2013.

Despite his humiliating fall from grace, Galliano's friends including Naomi Campbell and Anna Wintour are said to have encouraged the designer to make a comeback. 

Both Kate Moss and Naomi Campbell are rumoured to have been in contact with the designer during his darkest days of rehab in Arizona and supermodel Linda Evangelista made the journey to see Galliano in rehab on his first visitors' weekend.

She told Vanity Fair: 'I just didn't want that weekend to go by without anyone reaching out to him.' 

When the designer left rehab, Kate Moss showed her solidarity by insisting that he continue to design her wedding dress, even though he was no longer at Dior. 

The designer said he chose London for his inaugural show because he wants to go back to his 'formative years and his beginnings in the industry - and it is intrinsically related to the city's traditional tailoring history and heritage.'

A graduate of London's prestigious Central Saint Martin's College, Galliano was famous for his theatrical, romantic shows at Dior as well as for his creative designs for his John Galliano brand, which is still owned and run by LVMH, the world's biggest luxury group.

But Renzo Rosso, president of Only The Brave (OTB) group, which owns Maison Martin Margiela as well as jeans brand Diesel, Marni and Viktor & Rolf, would prefer not to dwell on the past.

He said in a statement at the time of Galliano's hiring: 'This appointment marks a new era in the history of the Maison.'

He also described Galliano as 'a visionary and non-conformist'. 

The line's founder Martin Margiela left his fashion house in 2009. Before that he kept a very low profile, rarely giving interviews. 

When he did, he preferred to do so in writing, and he would generally sign Maison Martin Margiela rather than his own name.

His brand's products did not carry the Belgian fashion house's name but visible white stitches instead as a signature.

At the time of Galliano's appointment, Bea Ercolini, editor-in-chief at the Belgian edition of Elle fashion magazine said: 'They hired the most visible designer to replace the most invisible designer, which is very ironic and funny and from that point of view, very much in the spirit of Maison Martin Margiela.'

OTB acquired Maison Martin Margiela in 2002 and the brand, which now makes around 100 million euros in annual sales, has been profitable for just under three years. In 2013, OTB made total revenues of 1.6 billion euros.
