Loic Courteau, long-time coach of Amelie Mauresmo when she played, illustrates her character by telling of the surprise that awaited him when he got back from holiday after the season when she made it to world No 1.

‘It was in 2004, we were at the US Open and there was a very nice car I saw on the street, an Infiniti,’ he recalled on Monday at the Aegon Championships, where he is now guiding Frenchman Julien Benneteau.

‘She didn’t say anything at the time but at end of the year I was on holiday and she called. I was in Morocco, she asked when I was coming back and told me she was coming to the airport to pick me up. She came with this same car to give me because she was No 1 in the world. She had found it for me.’

Many who know her intimately —and Courteau is among her closest confidants — speak of a thoughtfulness that is combined with an excellent tennis brain.

Appointment: Andy Murray, pictured training at Queen's, has appointed Amelie Mauresmo as his new coach

Top job: The two-time Grand Slam winner will take over in time for  Queen's

Understanding: Loic Courteau used to coach the former world No 1 Mauresmo

This combination has swayed Andy Murray to hire her.

‘When
 she is commentating on TV she says good things, sometimes the guys 
don’t get it right but all the time she says the right things,’ added 
Courteau.

‘What I like very 
much is that when she decides on something, she goes to the end. Some 
people you cannot talk to, but she is sensitive emotionally.

‘She is very clever, maybe for Andy’s team it will be different at the beginning but they are generous and will fit very well.

‘Maybe she and Andy should play mixed doubles together, that would be great!’

'Excited': Murray said Mauresmo was someone he 'always looked up to and admired'

Champ: Mauresmo won Wimbledon in 2006 and the Australian Open in the same year

Something the teetotal Murray will not have in common with his new coach is her passion for wine.

When she won Wimbledon in 2006, Mauresmo gave herself a long-awaited treat — buying a bottle of 1921 Chateau d’Yquem.

But
 the signs are that the pair will gel better than she did with Marion 
Bartoli, despite the fact that she was on her compatriot’s team when she
 won Wimbledon last year.

It
 appears that the extrovert  Bartoli, who relishes a high profile, 
grated with Mauresmo, who is much more private by inclination. ‘We were 
not compatible,’ she revealed.

Mauresmo
 has been publicity shy ever since she came out as gay at the 1999 
Australian Open, something that happened with a fanfare she subsequently
 regretted.

Hurtful things 
were said during that tournament, such as Martina Hingis describing 
playing her as like facing ‘half a man’ because of her impressive 
physique.

Previous: Mauresmo already has experience of coaching man, having worked with Michael Llodra

Exit: Murray lost to Rafa Nadal in the semi-finals of the French Open in Paris

For someone with a
 reserved nature who comes from a traditionally-minded family based just
 north of Paris, the whole experience was not enjoyable.

On
 several occasions she has said she found being in England more relaxing
 than being in her home country — and that becoming the first world No 1
 in a nation where tennis is massively popular brought an unwelcome 
focus.

Some who know her 
well from French tennis believe that the  biggest obstacle to her 
forming a successful partnership with Murray may be how she copes with 
the pressure. She arrives this morning at Queen’s Club to begin work and
 the attention will be fairly relentless until her new client finishes 
his Wimbledon campaign.

Murray
 has factored all this in and does not believe it will be a difficulty —
 not even the logistics of Mauresmo being unable to enter the men’s 
locker room.

‘Obviously you 
can’t sit down and chat in there, but there’s enough places where you 
can chat.  The  players’ lounge is pretty large,’ he told the BBC.

Laugh: Latvian Ernests Gulbis joked about Maria Sharapova or Ana Ivanovic becoming a coach to a male

Tonic: Murray will have to recover from the thumping he took at the hands of Nadal

‘Normally
 I speak about tactics the night before my matches and then 20, 30 
minutes before I go on court when I’m normally in the gym anyway. I 
don’t see any  problems in that respect.’

Few know Murray better than Ross Hutchins, the British doubles player who is tournament director this week.

He
 pointed out that his close friend has a long history of picking coaches
 through innovative hunches, rather than looking at their experience.

Hutchins
 also ventured that  Mauresmo will be given full responsibility for 
guiding his career: ‘I’d imagine that she will be the boss. In most 
sitiuations the head coach will be leading the show, organising the 
team. I believe Amelie will do that but ultimately it is Andy’s call 
about how much control she has.

‘I think she’ll be very smart, it’s not like she’s someone who is incapable of running his team.’

Ernests
 Gulbis had a typically irreverent reaction to the appointment, however,
 telling BBC radio last night: ‘I am waiting for a couple of 
good-looking tennis players to also quit tennis so that I can also have a
 new coach.

‘Sharapova, Ivanovic, Azarenka maybe. Who would make the better coach?’

Contact: Mauresmo said the pair had been discussing working together for a few weeks

Long term: Mauresmo suggested the pair would team not just on a short team basis
