Etan Patz went missing in 1979 when walking to school in New York City

The FBI appears to believe that missing Etan Patz, who vanished aged six from a New York City street in 1979, could still be alive.

Last month, a 30-year-old married man living and working in Europe, was contacted by a federal investigator on a tip-off that he could be the missing boy.

The FBI agent suggested to the man that he might not have been born where he'd been told and his parents were not biologically related to him.

The investigator asked the man where he had gone to school and lived in the past.

The man, who did not want to be identified, toldÂ  ProPublica that he didn't know who Etan Patz was and had to look up the case on the Internet.

He told the website: 'I thought you might want to know that the FBI may be working to prove the child is still alive.'

He added: 'I thought it was a hoax.'

The man, at 30, is 11 years younger than Etan Patz would now be.

The FBI provided no answers to the man about why they were still making calls about the missing boy after Pedro Hernandez came forward to admit to killing the boy in 2012 and now faces trial this spring.

The FBI would not comment when contacted today by MailOnline.

Hernandez, who has a history of mental illness, confessed to strangling Patz in the basement of a SoHo bodega in 1979. He has since recanted his story.

Hernandez was arrested in May 2012 - after Manhattan District Attorney Cy Vance re-opened the Patz case - when family members told authorities that he admitted to killing Patz.

Pedro Hernandez, the mentally troubled accused killer of longtime missing child Etan Patz, is due to stand trial later this year

The Etan Patz case was reopened in 2012 with the FBI investigating a Soho basement in New York City

At the time of Patz's disappearance, Hernandez worked in a bodega just blocks from the boy's home.

He then told authorities he'd seen Etan Patz at the bus stop, offered the boy a soda to entice him to a corner 
store where he worked and choked the boy in the basement.

Hernandez said he tossed Etan's book 
bag behind a basement freezer, put his limp body in a box and left it 
with some trash about a block away. No body or bag has ever been found.

Under New York law, a person can be 
convicted based only on a confession if there's additional evidence that
 a crime was committed.

However prosecutors
 may be forced to throw out the case against Hernandez - who is both 
schizophrenic and suffering from bipolar disorder - due to a lack of 
evidence.

On the morning of May 25, 1979, six-year-old Etan Patz left his SoHo apartment in New York City for the first time by himself to walk two blocks to catch the school bus. He was never seen again.

The anniversary was later named National Missing Children's Day in his memory. He became one of the first vanished children pictured on a milk carton.
