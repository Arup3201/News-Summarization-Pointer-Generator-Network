Taxpayers will end up footing the bill for legal fees for disgraced former Royal Bank of Scotland boss Fred Goodwin, it has emerged

Taxpayers will end up footing the bill for legal fees for disgraced former Royal Bank of Scotland boss Fred Goodwin, it has emerged.

Former shareholders have launched a £4billion lawsuit against RBS that is likely to see Goodwin appear in court.

The bank, which is 82 per cent owned by the taxpayer, refused to say whether it is paying for his representation.

But industry sources say it is standard practice for major companies to pick up the tab for former bosses in such cases – even though Goodwin is drawing a £342,500-a-year pension from his time at the bank.

According to a letter seen by the Daily Mail, law firm Herbert Smith is not only acting for RBS, but also for Goodwin, former chairman Sir Tom McKillop and former investment bank chief Johnny Cameron.

The bank is thought to have taken out ‘indemnity insurance’ that protects them against financial liability for lawsuits.

Labour MP John Mann, who sits on the Commons Treasury Committee, described the situation as ‘extraordinary’, saying: ‘It shows that the banks really don’t get it.’

He added: ‘He’s [Goodwin] done extremely well out of his mishandling of the bank so he should be paying for this himself. The taxpayer should not be footing the bill.’

And Matthew Sinclair, chief executive of the TaxPayers’ Alliance, said: ‘This is yet another slap in the face for taxpayers and a timely reminder that the bank must be put back into private hands as soon as possible.’

The case hinges on whether the bank gave an accurate picture of its financial health in 2008, when it asked investors to spend £12billion on new shares in a ‘rights issue’.

The shares plummeted in value as the bank came to the brink of collapse before being part-nationalised just months later, needing billions in public cash to keep it afloat.

Those who invested in the rights issue were left nursing huge losses.

The RBS Shareholders Action Group, which is co-ordinating the lawsuit, argues that RBS knew it was effectively bust without the extra cash, but failed to admit this.

The action group’s law firm Bird & Bird is expected to say that RBS billed the fundraising as a ‘capital strengthening exercise’ to shore it up against the approaching financial storm.

Instead, they will argue, RBS should have offered them the stock at a much lower price, admitting that it was conducting an emergency whip-round to save it from collapse following the disastrous acquisition of Dutch bank ABN Amro.

The deal, which saddled RBS with billions in toxic debt, was widely blamed for RBS’s near collapse and £45.5billion taxpayer-funded bailout.

RBS has denied making any misleading statements to investors.

Sanctions against Goodwin, nicknamed Fred the Shred for his ruthless stewardship of the bank, have so far been limited to him being stripped of his knighthood.

He was awarded a £703,000 pension when he retired at the age of 50 in October 2008 but eventually bowed to public anger, and agreed to forfeit £200,000 of the annual payout.
