Much like finding a flattering pair of jeans, mascara is something we spend our whole lives trying to get right.

But with new formulations and wand shapes promising everything from a false lash effect to a 360-degree curl, it’s hard to know which one is best for you.

Here, Leah Hardy tests the new High Street and high-end mascaras.

DRAMATIC DEFINITION

Max Factor created the mascara wand in 1958 and its new Masterpiece Transform, £9.99, has a slim, flexible wand with narrow bristles to coat each lash from root to tip.

It clumps slightly at the root so takes a couple of coats to fan out my lashes, but the extra effort is worth it. I look as if I am wearing eyeliner because of the volume it creates. This mascara makes me look brighter and more awake, and lasts all day without flaking or smudging. However, it may be too much for daytime. 4/5

OLD FAVOURITE

The updated formula of this make-up bag favourite, Maybelline Great Lash BIG, £4.99, in its distinctive green and pink packaging, has a bumper-size brush that promises bigger, more dramatic lashes.

Yes, it gives long, defined lashes that take only seconds to achieve, but it’s not particularly volumising. The colour is jet black and clump-free, and it is a bargain price. However, this mascara does flake as the day goes on, and proves stubborn to remove. 3/5

FABULOUS FLUTTER

Estee Lauder Sumptuous Bold Volume Lifting Mascara, £21, has tiny fibres that are said to plump lashes and a chunky, tapered wand designed to thicken and define. It creates, soft, feathery lashes as I layer it on. It looks as though I have more lashes, rather than simply thicker ones. I received lots of compliments when wearing this mascara — even from my husband! — and it lasted all day. My favourite. 5/5

NICE AND NATURAL

The latest L’Oreal mascara, Volume Million Lashes So Couture, £10.99, promises to give you flexible lashes.

Yes, the rounded, large wand leaves my lashes strikingly longer, but it is clumpy.

I love the intense black colour, which is also slightly glossy, giving a luxurious look. However, it isn’t as volumising as I expected. The brush is tricky to manage — I end up with blobs of mascara around my eyes. However, it’s brilliant at emphasising lower lashes, gives a pretty natural look rather than a high glamour one and lasts all day. 3½/5

SMUDGE PROOF

Mac False Lashes, £19, is a make-up artist favourite, but it doesn’t have the dramatic effect I was expecting. Though my top lashes certainly look separated and fluffy, it clumps on my bottom lashes — I look as if I’m going to a Sixties fancy dress party.

Though it stays in place all day without smudging, and glides off when I remove, it doesn’t live up to its false lash name. 1/5

CURL CREATOR

With an oddly shaped curved brush, which dips in the middle to catch inner lashes and curl outer ones, Rimmel Scandal Eyes Rockin’ Curves, £6.99, is designed to give volume and lift to your upper and lower lashes without clumps. The lengthening and curling is brilliant, but the volume is nothing to write home about. The curl also drops as the day went on, so I need to top it up a few times. 3/5

DOLL EYES

Benefit They’re Real, £19.50, is the best-selling mascara, promising every-thing from length to full-on volume. It has a narrow, rubberised brush for zig-zagging between the eyelashes. And, wow, it looks as if I’ve had eyelash extensions — with only two brush strokes I have a super-long, curled, doll-eye effect. A few lashes stick together, but the overall effect is inky black and glossy. However, it takes a bit of rubbing to shift it at bedtime. 4½/5

ULTIMATE GLAMOUR

Lancome’s Hypnose high glamour mascaras are firm favourites with beauty bloggers. The latest version, Grandiose, £24.50, has an unusual, bent ‘swan neck’ brush — which I found difficult to use — to lift and fan out lashes.

It gives a false-lash effect, with instantly longer, thicker and fuller lashes that are jet black and glossy. My lower lashes look endless. It’s a bit much if you like a natural look and the thick formula means some lashes stick together. It lasts well, with minimal flaking, yet comes off easily with eye make-up remover. 4½/5
