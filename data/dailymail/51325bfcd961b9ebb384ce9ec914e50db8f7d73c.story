Wales prop Aaron Jarvis is expected to be sidelined for 'around six weeks' after suffering a pectoral muscle injury.

It is a latest front-row blow for Jarvis' regional team the Ospreys, who are also currently without his fellow props Nicky Smith, Ryan Bevington and Duncan Jones.

Jarvis was hurt during Wales' 12-6 victory over South Africa at the Millennium Stadium 11 days ago.

Wales prop Aaron Jarvis is facing six weeks out of action after he picked up a pectoral muscle injury 

Confirming the injury, Ospreys medical performance manager Chris Towers said: 'Aaron tore his pectoral muscle playing for Wales against South Africa.

'The scan has confirmed that he doesn't require surgery, but he is still looking at a recovery period of around six weeks.' 

The Ospreys will also be without lock Lloyd Peers for Saturday's European Champions Cup clash against Racing Metro in Le Mans after he damaged ankle ligaments during last weekend's home 19-19 draw with the French club.

'He has had a scan which confirms damage to ankle ligaments,' Towers added.

'We will now discuss with an ankle specialist the options for his treatment over the next few days before deciding what is the best one for Lloyd.'
