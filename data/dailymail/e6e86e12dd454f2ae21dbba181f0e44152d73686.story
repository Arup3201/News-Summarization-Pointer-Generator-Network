A spy rolled around on the floor weeping and thrashing around when his ex-girlfriend refused to get back together with him, a court heard today.

The MI5 operative, being tried under the name 'Mark Barton', allegedly threw the woman, a fellow spy, into a cupboard while trying to convince her to go out with him again.

She told the court that she was forced to change her phone number because of the constant harrassment, and testified that Barton turned up at her mother's house and told her the pair were planning to get married.

The 29-year-old spy denies sexual assault, two physical assaults and harassing the woman, referred to as '2363', between August and December 2011.

Trial: Southwark Crown Court heard that an MI5 spy rolled around on the floor when his ex-girlfriend refused to get back together with him

The pair had begun seeing each other in July 2010, but the woman ended it within a year because Barton had not told his parents about her and had made her feel 'like a dirty secret', Southwark Crown Court has heard.

2363 told the court that Barton followed her after she left a work party in August 2011 and forced her to go to his flat as he lifted her off the Tube in a 'bear hug'.

He wanted to try and save their relationship, she said, even though she told him that their romance was permanently over.

'His behaviour continued to be out of control,' she told the court. 'He would roll around on the floor.

'He said he didn't understand why I am doing it, and can't we just talk like adults?

'I just shut off. I tried to reason but it didn't work. He was back rolling around the floor and thumping the floor.'

She said that she tried to leave but Barton held her back and threw her into a cupboard, forcing her to seek refuge in the bathroom.

Five days later, jurors heard, 2363 reluctantly agreed to meet Baron at a cafe, where he began acting extremely erratically.

She said he was shaking his coffee cup and 'repeatedly saying the word "latte"', as well as banging on the table and shouting.

'I started to feel threatened and frightened and wondered what I could do to sort the situation out,' 2363 told the court. 'I began to feel like this might not stop. His behaviour was unpredictable.'

The man's ex also testified that one weekend he called her so many times that she had to change her phone number.

'He was constantly ringing me,' she said. 'I turned my phone off because I was worried I would accidentally answer it.

'When I turned it back on in the morning it was still going, so I decided to change my number.'Barton allegedly visited her mother's house and told her the pair had got back together and would probably marry 'within two years'.

2363 said she thought her former boyfried had 'lost it a little bit', adding: 'Mark had never met my parents.

'I felt vulnerable and wide open because he'd got hold of my mother's address. I was shocked and a little bit violated. And I knew it had made my mum feel uncomfortable.'

She told jurors that after Barton was on the same train to London as her she decided to report him to managers at work, even though she 'felt guilty' about the possibility of getting him in trouble.

The next day, she said, she received a bouquet of flowers from him with a card attached and the note: 'I chose this card because I thought the dogs looked as sad as I feel.'

Despite being warned by MI5 bosses not to talk to each other, 2363 said she allowed him to stay friends with her and they went out together three times a week.

On October 8 the pair had dinner at her flat and kissed before going into her bedroom 'as if more was going to happen' before they had an argument because she changed her mind.

He stayed the night but did not have sex. Ten days later they went for dinner and drinks, 2363 hoping the defendant would understand they were nothing more than friends, she said.

She said he forced a kiss on her at a Tube station. 'I was frustrated with myself and felt I had got myself into trouble again,' said 2363, who said she was embarrassed about kissing him and trying to be friends.

Barton is accused of sexually assaulting 2363 five days later by forcing his way into her flat and aggressively kissing her on the lips.

'He lunged at me and punched the sofa at the side of my head,' she said. 'He was acting like he was really really angry with me.'

Barton's trial is being conducted amid tight security, with the defendant and witnesses screened off from the public and all witnesses from MI5 assigned numbers to preserve their anonymity.
