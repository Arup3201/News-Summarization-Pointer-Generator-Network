Forget scattering ashes into the sea, or even turning your
loved ones remains into vinyl records, the latest way to honour your dearly departed is to
launch them into space so they can become a shooting star.

Elysium Space is hoping to launch its first so-called 'memorial
flights' in summer 2014 from Cape Canaveral in Florida.

As part of the plans, the human remains will be launched into
space and orbit the Earth for 'several months' before burning up in the
atmosphere and becoming a 'shooting star.'

California-based Elysium Space plans to launch its first 'memorial flights' by summer 2014. The firm has already launched a mobile app, pictured, to track these ashes and as part of the plans urns will orbit Earth for 'several months' before burning up in the atmosphere and becoming a shooting star

The
company plans to work with space transport companies including SpaceX, Civeit
and Orbital Sciences to launch the flights.

The
price of a launch is $1,900 (£1,180) and for that, customers will be sent a kit
containing a scoop to transfer ‘a symbolic portion’ of ashes into an enclosed ash capsule.

The
capsule can be engraved with three initials and customers can also write a remembrance
message of up to 80 characters that will be added to the metal plates attached
on the spacecraft.

Once
the ashes have been put into the capsule, customers post it back to Elysium
Space to prepare it for the flight.

Family members will get an invitation to the launch viewing event as well as a video of the takeoff.

After the launch, a certificate will be sent to the family to commemorate the completion of the memorial flight.

The California-based firm has already launched a mobile app
to track the ashes sent into space on the flights.

The app's description reads: ‘The final frontier is an
exceptional place to honour and celebrate the life of someone you love.Elysium Space offers awe-inspiring memorial spaceflights to
have a symbolic portion of a departed's ashes launched into space.

'Our specially designed memorial spacecraft respectfully and
peacefully orbits the Earth for several months.

'Family and friends follow this journey through the stars
using the Elysium Mobile App, which shows in real-time the spacecraft location
and how the world looks from this majestic place.

'Eventually, in a last poetic moment, the spacecraft
harmlessly re-enters the Earth's atmosphere, blazing as a shooting star.'

The firm adds that the plans adhere to space environment
rules and the spacecraft and ashes have been designed not to create orbital
pollution. 

Another firm called Celestis began launching memorial flights in 1997 and the first flight carried the remains of Gene Roddenberry, the creator of the Star Trek series.
