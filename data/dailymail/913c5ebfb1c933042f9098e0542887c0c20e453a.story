David Cameron is seen as 'arrogant' while Ed Miliband is 'weak' according to exclusive new polling for MailOnline which asks voters to sum up political leaders in a single word.

For the first time voters have been captured on video making clear what they really think of the people bidding to run the country.

Using webcam technology and surveying more than 2,000 people, the poll also reveals that Lib Dem leader Nick Clegg is seen as 'weak' while Ukip's Nigel Farage is branded 'racist'.

Exclusive video polling for MailOnline reveals what voters think of the party leaders in their own words

The political blink test is designed to test the instant reaction voters have to seeing the party leaders jostling for their support on May 7.

More than 2,000 people were surveyed by Populus for MailOnline, and each were given the option to record their responses on camera.

It gives a Gogglebox-style insight into the personal reactions of members of the public to senior politicians.

The most frequent response to Mr Cameron was 'arrogant', followed by 'smug', 'leader', 'liar' and 'Prime Minister'.

Three people branded the Prime Minister a 'plonker', two called him 'evil' and one replied 'Blair'.

Nine called him a w*nker,  11 said 'knob' and 8 used the words 'arsehole'. Six mentioned Eton and four called the Prime Minister a 'c***'.

Prime Minister David Cameron was branded 'arrogant', followed by 'smug', 'leader', 'liar' and 'Prime Minister'.

When a photograph of Mr Miliband was displayed, the most popular response was 'weak' followed by 'idiot', 'Labour', 'useless' and 'untrustworthy'.

Other frequent responses were 'weird', 'incompetent', 'boring' and 'honest'. The top 10 is completed by 'Wallace', the plasticine character the Labour leader is often likened to. One person called him 'Gromit'. 

Five people thought of 'bacon sandwiches' as the first reaction to Mr Miliband, after his disastrous attempt to be photographed eating breakfast a year ago.

Five also called him a 'clever', four mentioned 'hope' and one said Mr Miliband was 'cute'. One said 'anus', two said 'crap' and five called him a 'moron'.

Like Mr Miliband, the overwhelming response to Mr Clegg was 'weak'. The Lib Dem leader has seen his party's popularity collapse since entering coalition five years ago, in large part as a result of the broken promise to abolish tuition fees.

Popular responses to the Deputy PM also include 'liar', 'don't know', 'untrustworthy' and 'useless'.

In a sign that not everyone knows who he is, or is unsure what to feel about him, the top 10 is completed by 'idiot', 'nothing', 'who?', 'OK' and 'unsure'.

Two people described the Deputy PM as a 'poodle', four said he was a 'sell-out' and one branded him a 'tosser'. One called him a 'slag', another said 'numbskull' and two said 'pillock'

The overwhelming reaction to Mr Farage was to brand him a 'racist'. Ukip has been dogged by revelations about its candidates and members, with Mr Farage insisting he will take action against those who embarrass the party.

But he has also courted controversy by defending a candidate taped mocking 'poofters', referring to a Chinese woman as a 'Chinky bird' and threatening to 'shoot peasants'.

The next most frequent reactions to Mr Farage included 'idiot', 'dangerous', 'arrogant' and 'bigot'.

The top 10 responses also included 'untrustworthy', 'honest' and 'joke'. Five people said 'frog', five said 'yuk!' and another five replied 'w*nker'.

Daisy Powell-Chandler, a consultant at Populus, said: 'It is a fact ignored by most politicians that the public aren't paying attention most of the time.

'Voters have families, jobs and bills that are much more interesting to them than today's policy launch or staged visit.'

As the election approaches on May 7, more information will start trickle through.

'But many of the electorate will be choosing who to vote for (or whether to vote at all) based on how each party leader scores on the 'blink test' – the immediate reaction when they see or hear party leaders in the media. This poll shows precisely that.

'It is clear from the results that all political leaders are polarising figures with strong downsides. People think Cameron is arrogant, Miliband is weak, Clegg cannot be trusted, and Farage is a racist.

'But the flipside of these criticisms are things we like about them: Cameron may come across as smug but he is smooth and competent – an assertive leader.

'Ed is weird but caring and intelligent. Clegg is the likeable liberal and Farage a charismatic, funny man.

'Over the course of the campaign, the electorate need to decide which of these attributes are most important and the emotional connections that the public make with these leaders are likely to be an important factor in deciding who the next Prime Minister is.'
