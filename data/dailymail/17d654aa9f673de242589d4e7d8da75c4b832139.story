Taylor Turner, 14, from Basildon, was born with multiple heart defects

While
 most teenagers have been looking forward to the start of the summer 
holiday, Taylor Turner has been desperate to get back to school.

Last
 term, all he could manage were a couple of mornings a week - and even 
then, his mother Donna made sure he travelled by taxi.

Taylor, 14, 
rolls his eyes with the frustration of it all. He and Donna share an 
incredibly close relationship but he just wants to be with his friends. 
More than anything, he wants to be 'normal'. But life for Taylor is far 
from normal.

Born with a life-limiting heart condition, Taylor was 
having palliative care at home when, at the age of six, he was thrown a 
lifeline.

In 2006, he received a heart transplant at Great Ormond Street
 Hospital.

This gave him eight brilliant years of childhood that his
 mother thought he would never see. But now, unbearably, just as he is 
getting ready to spread his wings, his donor heart is failing and he 
desperately needs another.

In December, Taylor could still walk five 
minutes round the corner to see his grandfather. Now his condition has 
deteriorated to the point where he can no longer climb the stairs.

The
 shortest burst of exercise could cause a cardiac arrest, which both 
frightens him and makes him angry. When he was put back on the 
transplant list in May, he was warned the chances of finding a suitable 
donor were slim.

As the Mail has highlighted, there is a chronic 
shortage of donor organs for all ages. Currently, 256 people are waiting
 for hearts, 32 of them children, and one in five will die waiting. The 
fact that Taylor has already had one transplant presents extra 
complications: not only does he have his own antibodies but the donor's,
 too, which doubles the risk of rejection.

'This time, Taylor 
understands everything that's happening,' says Donna. 'At his last 
appointment he asked the team: "Are you going to let me die?"'

Outwardly,
 Donna seems calm, but it's just a shell she has developed to hide the 
emotional storm raging underneath. She checks on Taylor three times a 
night, placing her hand on his chest to make sure he's breathing.

'I 
feel we've been fighting this war for ever,' she says. And there are few
 places to turn to for support.

She is a member of a heart transplant 
Facebook group but, as she explains: 'We've had three children in the 
group die in a fortnight. When you hear of another death you want to be 
sick, then you think, "I don't want to know". It makes you selfish.'

Taylor was born by emergency caesarean at Basildon Hospital on April 4, 1999, weighing an apparently healthy 8lb 1oz.

But
 his heart rate was sky-high and he was diagnosed with a list of 
problems. He had anatomically corrected transposition of the great 
arteries - meaning the main two arteries were plumbed into the wrong 
chambers of his heart. As a result, the blood being pumped around his 
body was too low in oxygen to supply the body's demands, while too much 
oxygenated blood was going to his lungs.

He also had 
Wolff-Parkinson-White syndrome, where an extra electrical connection in 
his heart made it beat abnormally fast. It would often reach 289 (for a 
child under one, from 80-160 is normal), which meant he was at constant 
risk of cardiac arrest, where the heart stops pumping.

'I cried for
 a whole year when Tay was born,' recalls Donna. 'And then I thought: "I
 need to pull myself together now, because this is our normal". But 
while the doctors kept having meetings, nothing seemed to be getting 
better and, inside my head, I was planning his funeral. His problems 
were so complex, no one knew what his life expectancy was.'

Donna was
 told that when he was bigger, at some point Taylor would need surgery 
to place a band on the artery that was allowing too much blood to flow 
into his lungs, as this would permanently damage the blood vessels.

Meanwhile,
 Taylor struggled - he would barely feed and didn't reach the normal 
developmental milestones, such as rolling over and sitting up when he 
should; his skin was grey as his heart struggled to pump enough 
oxygenated blood into his system.

Taylor's father, unable to cope with the shock of having such a sick baby, left Donna and Taylor's older brother Sam, now 17.

During his first two years, Taylor spent more time in Basildon Hospital than at home, and there were frequent emergency dashes.

'Normally,
 Taylor's heart rate was 120 beats per minute but I could tell when it 
was going up by watching the vein that pulsed in his neck,' Donna says.

'If
 it went over 200 bpm - a sign of supraventricular tachycardia (a 
dangerously fast heartbeat) - I'd call an ambulance; we were in the 
children's ward every week.'

There, staff would put ice packs over 
Taylor's face or plunge him head-first into buckets of icy water to 
shock the vagus nerve, which runs from the brain to the abdomen, into 
lowering his heart rate. 'It was unbearable,' says Donna. 'He'd fight a 
bit, then stop thrashing. I thought they'd drown him.'

When he was 
almost three, Taylor had surgery at the Royal Brompton Hospital, London,
 to fit the pulmonary band. He also had an external temporary pacemaker 
fitted to provide electrical stimulation to correct the disturbances in 
his heart rhythm.

'He was a tiny little thing, with skin so thin you
 could see his veins,' recalls Donna. 'Everyone said he'd thrive after 
surgery. But he was in intensive care for four weeks and we thought he'd
 never come off the ventilator.'

Three children died on Taylor's ward
 while he was there. 'The noise parents make when their child dies is a 
sound I never want to hear again,' she says.

'Then their precious 
child is taken away on a metal gurney, under a white sheet, and the 
parents go with them. How the mums manage to walk, I don't know. The 
cardiac ward is like a war zone. You develop a toughness. You focus on 
your own child and will him to breathe.' When Taylor was five he went to
 school for a couple of mornings a week in a wheelchair. Then, when he 
was six, he had a 17-hour operation called a 'double switch' to change 
the arteries round.

Throughout the surgery, Donna paced, and shopped
 for clothes and toys for her son. 'I thought if I bought him enough 
stuff, he'd be all right,' she says.

Afterwards, Taylor briefly 
looked amazingly healthy. But three weeks later he was worse than 
before. 'The doctors said there was nothing else they could do, and we 
were offered palliative care; I had to draw up a plan for how I wanted 
him to die, and it felt as if I was signing his death certificate. It 
was like giving up - and I wasn't ready to do that.'

Taylor and his mother Donna. They are now waiting for a new heart

Taylor's team at
 the Brompton, desperately trying to buy him more time, asked Great 
Ormond Street Hospital, which specialises in children's heart 
transplants, to assess his suitability. By then, Taylor had end-stage 
heart failure, his heart only just keeping him alive. He could barely 
walk.

Three months later, on November 11, Armistice Day, he had his 
transplant. 'We are forever grateful that someone who lost a loved one 
had the selflessness that gave Taylor a new life,' says Donna.

When Taylor came back from surgery she didn't recognise him because he was pink, not grey.

Taylor,
 always tiny, began to crave big meals such as roast dinners, and grew 
in front of her eyes. After Christmas he was able to go to school 
full-time, and he never looked back.

His life since has been full of
 fun. But although he loves sport and the house is full of medals and 
cups he has won in the National Transplant Games, Donna has never 
completely relaxed. 'A transplant will only last 15 to 20 years,' she 
says. 'You know it's not for ever.'

At a routine check-up last 
October, there was devastating news. Taylor has developed a form of 
rejection of his new heart, which causes his arteries to narrow.

His
 heart can't pump blood around his body fast enough, so he is at 
constant risk of cardiac arrest. 'I was absolutely hysterical and, at 
the same time, trying to be strong for Taylor,' says Donna.

'The shortage of organs is such that they wouldn't put Taylor on the list until he's dying. We have now reached that point.

'His
 consultant said: "Taylor, if you do PE, you will drop down dead".' He 
isn't allowed to do any activity that would cause his heart to pump 
faster, and spends most of his time on his Playstation.'At parents' 
evening recently, Taylor's teachers said he has so much potential but, 
since he had this devastating news, he has been difficult and 
destructive. He dreams of being a PE teacher, but doesn't know if he'll 
be alive long enough to take his GCSEs.'

Taylor talks about another 
teenage boy he met at Great Ormond Street. 'He was scared. I told him: 
"Don't worry, the surgery will be fine." But, in the end, he didn't get 
his heart in time and he died.' How does Taylor cope? 'Honestly, I 
don't think about it,' he says. 'There's no point. I'm really hoping for
 a new heart, but in the meantime I just get on with my life. What else 
can I do?'
