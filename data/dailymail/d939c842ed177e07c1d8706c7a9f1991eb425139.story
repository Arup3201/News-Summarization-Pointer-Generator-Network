Pub bosses have been branded sexist for using a barmaid's cleavage to advertise their new ales.

Staff at The Victoria, in Birmingham city centre, posted the picture of Lucy Wedge, 22, posed between the pumps of their guest ales, on the venue’s Twitter and Facebook profiles.

Miss Wedge was wearing a low-cut black vest in the photo, exposing her cleavage, and numerous complaints were posted under the image, claiming it objectified women.

The photo was quickly removed from Facebook and an apology was posted, saying: 'It was meant as a light hearted joke between two female bartenders and a few of our regular guests and we could not have predicted the strong response it would receive.'

However, the image can still be seen on The Victoria’s Twitter page, which has 5,513 followers, along with the caption 'Come get a #realale from a #realwoman'.

Pub regular Annie-Marie Hopper, 34, said: 'It was a very tasteless and old-fashioned way to shamelessly promote the pub.

'They should be ashamed they have reduced themselves to this very blatant sexual objectification of a lady in such a sexist manner.'

Lucy Wedge, 22, who posed for the photo, said the image was not provocative

Other customers have come out in support of the pub, branding those who complained 'jobsworths'.

Commenting on the Facebook apology, Lee Amber wrote: 'Some people need to get a hold of themselves. Why even waste energy getting offended by a light hearted image. F****** jobsworths.'

Miss Wedge herself has also come out to support the marketing ploy.

The self-proclaimed tomboy said: 'It wasn't like pose by this pump with your boobs out.

'I leaned in and she took the pic and, to be honest, I was more concerned it was going to be embarrass as everyone would know it was me by my tattoo.

'The next day I saw that Steph [another barmaid who runs the pub's social media] had removed it and I apologised,

'If I had been there with my boobs out then fine but a bit of cleavage isn't a big problem. It wasn't a provocative photo.

'I drink pints with the blokes and I think that my attitude isn't represented in the photo. People might think I'm one of those girls who loves male attention but I'm not.'

Julian Rose-Gibbs, 40, owner of The Victoria, said if it had been left up to him the photo would not have been taken down.

He said: "Steph was really upset but she did the right thing by apologising and removing it after the comments she was receiving.

'We give her free roam on our social media and stand by her decisions.

'However if I had been aware at the time I wouldn't have removed it.'

Assistant general manager of the pub, Ian Cole, 37, also defended the photo.

The pub has apologised for posting the photo but many staff and customers are standing by the image as 'light hearted'

He said: 'Basically whoever is behind the bar that day is pictured. It could be a man or a woman.

'Lucy happened to be wearing a vest that day. We usually promoted beers three or four times a week when we get new ales on.

'There were 7,500 views of the pic and only 37 complaints. These were quite strongly worded so that's when Steph withdrew the picture.'
