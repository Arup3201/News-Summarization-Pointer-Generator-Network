A luxury home David and Victoria Beckham shared has gone on the market at a knock down £2million price.

The couple shared the converted barn near Alderley Edge, Cheshire, while the footballer was playing for Manchester United.

The Beckhams bought the property for £1.25million in 2001 and spent £200,000 doing it up - but sold it four years later after the midfielder had moved to Real Madrid.

The new owners put the property up for sale last year and have now cut the asking price from £2.25million to £2million.

The Grade II listed property boasts five bedrooms, a leisure complex with a 35ft indoor mosaic-tiled swimming pool and a boot room.

The three-storey Hollinshead House, which is 16 miles from Manchester City Centre, sits on half an acre of land and boasts landscaped gardens and grounds.

The ground floor opens with a huge entrance hall and boasts a luxurious play room, drawing room, and breakfast room.

There is also a hand made David Lisle kitchen with limestone floor and granite worktops, utility room, boot room, and bathroom.

Hollinshead House is situated at the end of a private road behind electric gates in Nether Alderley, just outside Alderley Edge.

Crispin Harris, from Jackson Stops estate agents in Wilmslow, Cheshire, said: 'It has been on the market since last August and the price has now been reduced.

'We advertised it at the original price and didn’t find a buyer so reducing it made it far more attractive.

'Also, the stamp duty on properties over £2 million has gone up from five per cent to seven per cent, making them more expensive to buy.

'Houses slightly under two million therefore make it far more attractive to a buyer because the tax isn’t so much.

'It’s absolutely stunning property in an extremely popular location and you can understand why anyone would want to buy it.'
