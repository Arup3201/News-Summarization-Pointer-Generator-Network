Morgan Lake is 5ft 10in with a movie-star name to match her prolific talent. Yet she is still just 17 years old; a schoolgirl waiting for her AS exam results in English, PE and business this summer.

Her selection as the youngest member of England’s athletics team for the Commonwealth Games in Glasgow caused those two worlds of teenager and athlete to collide, perhaps a little too soon. As revealed by Sportsmail, Lake has withdrawn from the Games to compete in the heptathlon at the World Junior Championships in Oregon, USA.

She decided to prioritise her long-term ambitions but was also concerned about the lack of  contact she would have with her father and coach, Eldon, as he would not have been allowed to stay in the athletes’ village. This allowed England to call up Grace Clements, 30, as Lake’s replacement but also sparked much debate and some criticism.

Lake’s father left it entirely for her to decide. Eldon, 45, a former British junior international triple jumper now working as an IT consultant, is not a pushy parent.

‘It was a difficult one; a real dilemma,’ he said, ‘but Morgan thought the right thing to do was the World Juniors. It was her choice, not mine or anyone else’s.

‘The athletes’ village was a factor. You don’t want to expose her to that environment without all of her usual support structure around her.  

‘She’s just 17 and we didn’t take all these things into account when she was first selected. It’s late notice but it’s the right  solution in terms of Morgan’s long-term development. People like Usain Bolt went through World Juniors before they graduated to seniors. We wanted to do both but we weren’t allowed.’

Success has come quickly for Lake, the British junior heptathlon record-holder and second on the under-20 all-time list behind Katarina Johnson-Thompson after scoring 6,081 points in Gotzis, Austria, last month.

She trains for only an hour a few times a week yet still has nearly three years to better Johnson-Thompson’s under-20 score of 6,287 points.

Britain’s heptahlon pedigree is 
impressive. Denise Lewis and  Jessica Ennis-Hill have both won Olympic 
gold this century and Johnson-Thompson, still only 21, is tipped for 
glory in Glasgow.

Lake has 
also recently been warm-weather training in Tenerife with Grace 
Davies-Redmond, the 16-year-old daughter of British Olympians Sharron 
Davies and Derek Redmond. Lake said: ‘I remember watching Jess at the 
Olympics and thinking it was amazing to see a heptathlete in the 
limelight. I watched it and thought, “I’d like to be at the Olympics one
 day”.

‘Jess and Kat have all the records so it’s something for me to chase;  milestones to achieve. For the 2016 Olympics in Rio I just want to make the team. Who knows about four or eight years after that?’

Lake is more like Lewis than Ennis-Hill. She excels in the throws and high jump, in which she has cleared 1.93metres this season, although a 200m lifetime best of 24.59sec was her personal highlight of the performance in Gotzis. She was called Morgan because her parents were expecting a boy. She started athletics when she was just five, she and younger brother Gabriel following dad to the track. Mum Sara ‘isn’t sporty but knows all my results,’ says Lake, with a smile.

What could be an intense  relationship between father (coach) and daughter is helped by the fact Lake is still at boarding school in Berkshire. ‘It’s good having Dad as a coach,’ she says, ‘most of the time! He’s been through it when he was younger, so he can help me get through the hard stuff. It’s a good balance.’

Eldon, though, admits it can be difficult combining the roles. ‘When things are going well it’s brilliant,’ he says, ‘but there are days when it’s like Brian and Nigel Clough. Then we look at it, discuss it and in the end she does what I want her to do.

‘But she’s a fighter. She’s determined in training but the best comes out of her in competitions. She wasn’t always the most talented, or the most natural but she worked hard to become the best.’
