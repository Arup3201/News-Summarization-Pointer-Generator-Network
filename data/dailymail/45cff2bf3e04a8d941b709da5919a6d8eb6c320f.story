Even day-to-day tasks like dealing with bills causes a fifth of Brits to feel anxious and unconfident

In a disturbing glimpse of the country’s mood, it seems a quarter of Britons never feel good about themselves and are riddled by insecurities.

New research reveals that the country seriously lacks confidence with our appearance, our ability to parent, and basic tasks like paying bills correctly all causing us anxiety.

A survey of 2,033 respondents revealed that for over a quarter, facing themselves in the mirror ranked highest in terms of situations where confidence escaped them, with 33 per cent saying their body is the thing they would most like to change to improve their self-assurance.

Other things that left Britons insecure were dealing with bank or utility companies, which left nearly one fifth of adults feeling unconfident, and taking children to the local swimming pool at the weekends (30 per cent).

The research also showed that while women battled with confidence more than men (with 10 per cent of more women admitting to never feeling good about themselves, and 15 per cent more with little or no confidence) there is one situation that turns both sexes into nervous wrecks - parental insecurities.

A similar number of men and women (21 per cent) face similar concerns when it comes to measuring up against other parents at the school gate and at children's’ parties.

Although those with children fared better than childless respondents in terms of feeling good, it was an even playing field when it came to confidence with virtually the same amount admitting to having little or no confidence – in fact, a worrying 35 per cent of parents felt they had none to pass on to their children.

The research supports the old adage that we get more confident with age, with those respondents in the 55-and-upwards age bracket citing the here and now as the time they felt their best.

Regional differences in confidence were also revealed by the survey, which casts doubt over the perceived self-assurance of the North.

Despite living in a city renowned for its party atmosphere, results have shown that the ‘Scouser Smile’ may be all for show, with Liverpudlians having the highest percentage of those who never feel good at 30.8 per cent, closely followed by their Welsh neighbours, Cardiff at 26.8 per cent.

Insecurities over parenting abilities is one of the greatest causes of lack of confidence for both men and women with children, though overall they are more confident than childless couples

The ‘Celtic Craic’ must count for something though, with Edinburgh and Belfast ranking low in terms of respondents, with only 12.8 per cent claiming they never feel good.

A spokesman for the Transform Cosmetic Surgery Group who conducted the study commented on the findings, saying: ‘The research commissioned has thrown up some pretty shocking statistics with regards to just how low some of us are feeling on a daily basis, and how little confidence we have.

‘Most startling is how a lack of confidence can result in a total inability to complete simple tasks, and undertake every day activities. Sadder still, is the high percentage of respondents who find looking at themselves in the mirror as the biggest blow to confidence.'
