Driving to Europe on holiday? Well watch out.

British motorists face heavy fines if caught on camera committing driving offences on the Continent under a new crackdown by Brussels.

The plans could see police across Europe being given the right to access British drivers’ details from the Government’s Driver and Vehicle Licensing Agency for the first time.

This will allow them to chase motorists with GB plates across the Channel for motoring penalties accrued anywhere in the EU.

Offences covered include speeding, running a red light and driving while using a mobile phone.

Demands for fines would be sent out and, if necessary, pursued through the courts.

British drivers can currently be fined for motoring offences in Europe only if stopped by an officer who can issue an on-the-spot penalty or march them to a cashpoint.

But anyone driving a car with GB plates which is caught by roadside camera gets off scot-free.

Last night, the Department for Transport admitted the crackdown could even extend to transferring penalty points between countries which, in some cases, may lead to a driving ban.

The AA said there was already evidence that French police were targeting UK drivers with a disproportionate number of speed cameras on roads to Channel ports

But ministers pledged to ‘resist any changes’ that penalise motorists in Britain, which has the best road safety record in Europe. 

Motoring groups condemned the move as a ‘nightmare’ that takes no account of differing rules across Europe.

The AA 
said there was already evidence that French police were targeting UK 
drivers with a disproportionate number of speed cameras on roads to 
Channel ports. 

The
 clampdown – due to come into force by next May – followed a ruling by 
the European Court of Justice, which has overturned a UK opt-out against
 such measures.

It is subject to a majority vote in the European Parliament and 
approval by a majority of the Council of Ministers, which represents 
member states. Britain cannot veto the proposals, but only lobby other 
members to oppose them.

The DfT confirmed the ruling had scuppered the UK opt-out but insisted everything was now ‘subject to renegotiation’. 

AA
 president Edmund King said: ‘Our Government should indeed oppose this 
at all costs. It’s a nightmare. It opens up a hornets’ nest.

'There is not a level playing field across Europe in terms of penalties and regulations and levels of enforcement.

‘Here
 in Britain we have speed awareness courses for first-time speeders. 
Other countries don’t. The European Commission, which is drawing up the 
new law, said: ‘The measure will also mean UK police forces can collect 
fines due from drivers from other parts of Europe.’
