The weather could turn out to be the most frightening thing this Halloween with a blast of freakishly cold weather set to the hit the Northeast and even the possibility of snow forecast in some areas.  

Bone-chilling air, rain and even some early-season snow will fall on parts of those regions on Friday, according to a forecast from AccuWeather.

Frosty the Snowman might be a better Halloween costume than Dracula this year.

After the treat - an exceptionally mild week with temperatures in the mid-60s - comes the trick as temperatures will drop towards the end of this week with high's forecast to be in the 50s on Thursday and Friday for Halloween.

The cold front plunges through the Great Lakes early, then through the Ohio Valley and Appalachians. Rain may mix with, or changeover to wet snow in parts of Michigan, northern and eastern Wisconsin early to the Ohio Valley and Appalachians later in the day into the night. Bands of lake-effect rain or snow may set up

The storm will start out as a disturbance in the upper levels of the atmosphere, associated with a cold front near the surface on Friday. This front will move through the Great Lakes and into central New York, producing rain and wet snow showers as it does so

Kids and adults partaking in the Friday evening Masquerade will need to bundle up. Rain showers will stretch from along part of the Interstate-95 corridor westward to Pittsburgh, Buffalo and New York, as temperatures begin to tumble

A potent storm is heading for New England straight from northern Canada this weekend bringing with it the coldest air of the season down from the polar regions.

It will feel more like December as temperatures will struggle to reach 40 degrees both Saturday and Sunday in the northeast.

"The dramatic change to colder air following late-summerlike warmth will be a shock for some people," wrote AccuWeather meteorologists Brett Rathburn and Alex Sosnowski in a morning forecast. 

"Kids and adults partaking in the evening masquerade will need to bundle up and should consider bringing along a light or reflective items to increase visibility for passing motorists." 

There is likely to be some snow in some areas where temperatures will remain in the 30s all weekend. 

Additional snow may fall over the Appalachians from east Tennessee and western North Carolina north to at least eastern West Virginia. Some wet snow may also linger in parts of eastern Lower Michigan, Ohio, western Pennsylvania, western New York. Snow may develop later in parts of northern New England

Some snow, possibly heavy, in parts of northern New England, including some lower elevations. As of now, the best chance of snow looks to be in northern/eastern Maine

Although forecasters are not being specific in where snowfall may hit, it's almost a certainty.

Regardless of how the storm plays out, it looks like Halloween night is not going to be a great night for trick-or-treating in many areas, as a raw, chilly wind sweeps in from the north across New England, and rain showers develop. 

Snow isn't all that unusual in the interior Northeast and New England this time of year: The season's first measurable snow usually falls during the first week of November in cities such as Buffalo, Syracuse and Burlington, Vt.

And there have been other snow events around Halloween over the years, including the Halloween Nor'easter of 2011, which deposited a half a foot of snow or more from central Maryland to central Maine,

The clocks go back early on Sunday morning. A final reminder that winter is right around the corner.

Nothing to panic over: o one is forecasting a repeat of the Halloween storm of 2011 that left 6 inches of snow in New York City and knocked out power to about 2.3 million customers
