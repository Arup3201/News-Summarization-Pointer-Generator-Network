Five Britons detained in Russia as part of the so-called 'Arctic 30' have today returned home to the UK.

The five were arrested amid claims of hooliganism following a protest about oil drilling and held in jail for two months.

They have since been granted amnesty under a new Russian law.

Greenpeace members Anthony Perrett, 32, 
Alexandra Harris, Phil Ball, Iain Rogers and freelance 
videographer Kieron Bryan left St Petersburg earlier today.

They arrived in Paris this afternoon 
before travelling to London's St Pancras Station on Eurostar to be met 
by their families, a spokesman for the organisation has said.

A sixth Briton, activist Frank Hewetson, has also been released and is travelling to another country.

Speaking at St Pancras, Mr Bryan's brother, Russell, said his return to the UK was 'a massive relief'.

'It's been a long few months for all the family. We're just so glad it's coming to an end,' he said.

'It was very difficult when he was in prison. We couldn't really speak to him.

'We had one phone call and series of letters but the letters were way behind where we were.

'Even last week we were still thinking he could potentially face seven years in jail and face these ridiculous charges.

'It's a massive relief.'

Mr
 Bryan said his brother Kieron, who lives in Peckham, south London, had 
decided to take a job in Afghanistan before his arrest in Russia.

'I'm sure Mum won't let him out of his room now,' he added.

'I'm not going to stand here and pick his jobs.

'His job as a journalist inherently involves risks.'

A
 spokesman for Greenpeace said: 'After 102 days it's great to have them 
on the way back home. We've spoken to them and they're excited to be 
coming back.

'It is a relief to their families who have gone through a difficult time.'

The group were detained for protesting against an Arctic offshore oil rig owned by the Russian company Gazprom.

Mr Perrett, who was the first to be 
released, spent Christmas Day in St Petersburg before being given the 
news that the Russian authorities had given him a visa and his passport.

Earlier this week he said: 'We took peaceful action to defend a part of the world that is the heartbeat of our climate.

'The Arctic is a measure of our 
planet's health and I refuse to stay silent as the oil companies line up
 to profit from its destruction.

'Together
 we are saying to the oil companies that the Arctic is off limits and 
that we must save this beautiful region for future generations.'

Band members of the punk group Pussy Riot were also released under the amnesty.

They
 have been serving a two-year sentence after the group performed a song 
critical of President Vladmimir Putin in 2012 in Moscow's Cathedral of 
Christ.
