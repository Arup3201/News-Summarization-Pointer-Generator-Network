Hate preachers will be banned from British television, Theresa May signalled last night.

The Home Secretary condemned the BBC and other broadcasters for interviewing ‘disgusting’ extremist cleric Anjem Choudary after the murder of soldier Lee Rigby.

In a dramatic escalation of the rules on hate preachers, Mrs May said she will ask broadcasting watchdog Ofcom to step in.

Under plans to be drawn up by a new task force on extremism, Ofcom is expected to win powers to stop hate preachers appearing on television.

At the moment the quango has the power to intervene only after an inappropriate broadcast has been made.

The move is the most dramatic attempt to gag those who peddle extremist views since the Thatcher government’s 1988 ban on IRA spokesmen being heard on television, which led to the words of Gerry Adams being read out by an actor.

As the backlash against British-based preachers of hate intensified:

Most dramatically of all, the Home Secretary and senior officials indicated the Government wants to censor broadcasters from carrying interviews in which militants incite hate.

Mrs May said it was inappropriate to interview Choudary – who helped form the now-banned Islamist groups Al-Muhajiroun and Al Ghurabaa and is accused of helping to radicalise several terrorists – in the wake of Drummer Rigby’s death.

Choudary, 46, described Adebolajo as a man of ‘impeccable character’ in interviews with BBC Newsnight and Channel 4 News last week. Mrs May said: ‘I think Anjem Choudary has disgusting views and I think it is right that we look at how those views are being presented.

‘There were many people who did indeed say, “What is the BBC doing interviewing Anjem Choudary?”’

A senior Home Office official said: ‘This is an issue the task force will now need to look at – whether a public service broadcaster thinks it is right to give a platform to views like this.’

The move could put Mrs May on a fresh
 collision course with the Liberal Democrats, who have already blocked 
her attempts to beef up the surveillance powers of the security 
services.

One Lib Dem 
source described the suggestion as ‘an obvious comparison’ with the 
gagging of the IRA, which was widely perceived to be a public relations 
farce for the Government.

The Home Secretary revealed that 2,000 people on ‘the path’ to violence had been intercepted by the authorities since the coalition came to power. 

She said there were ‘potentially several thousands’ more, and added: ‘We need to look at the question of whether perhaps we need to have banning orders to ban organisations that don’t meet the threshold for proscription.’

In addition, Mrs May said she wanted to reintroduce measures in the Data Communications Bill, which would allow the security services to monitor every email, phone and social network message sent by everyone in the country.

The ‘Snoopers’ Charter’ Bill was dropped from the Queen’s Speech after opposition from the Lib Dems.
