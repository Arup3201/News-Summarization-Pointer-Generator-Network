The Leeds United pantomime now has one of the directors trying to justify on social media the ongoing scandal of former chief executive David Haigh spending nine months in a Dubai jail without charge or trial.

Haigh, who is sharing a small cell with two others, remains the longest-serving inmate at Bur Dubai police station despite his powerful legal team filing High Court actions for deceit, loss of earnings and false imprisonment against former Leeds owners GFH Capital.

GFH claim Haigh took £3.9million against false invoices when employed by them at Leeds. Haigh says he was owed that money in salary, commissions and expenses.

But this farce, in which the Football League run by former Leeds chief Shaun Harvey should surely intervene, now has Jinesh Patel, GFH Capital’s senior executive officer and a Leeds board member, reacting on Twitter to fans questioning Haigh’s extraordinary plight.

Patel said: ‘The lies being peddled by Haigh are just that — lies. His incarceration is wholly the responsibility of the Dubai police and public prosecutor who are considering criminal claims against him for defrauding GFH.’

Patel, whose tweets are being examined by Haigh’s lawyers, also told fans he was responsible for uncovering Haigh’s alleged fraud.

Jerome Champagne, a fanciful FIFA presidential candidate from the start, finished his statement announcing his failure to gain the necessary five nominations by saying he would declare in due course his preferred candidate — as if anyone cares a fig what he thinks now.

The failure by former FIFA deputy general secretary Champagne  to get endorsements, despite a year on the campaign trail as a stooge candidate for Sepp Blatter, is understood to have a lot to do with opposition from FIFA secretary general Jerome Valcke.

FA chairman Greg Dyke, who is addressing staff on Tuesday about his streamlining plans, is keen to break down diversity barriers at Wembley. His latest move is to promote Kelly Simmons, who has done a lot to develop the women’s game, and human resources chief Mel Milner to the FA’s all-important senior management team.

Such moves, plus the arrival of interim chief operating officer Nick Humby, will only add to speculation that England Rugby 2015 chief executive and Football League director Debbie Jevans remains top of Dyke’s list to be the next FA chief executive and he will wait until she is available after the Rugby World Cup.

Also added to the FA’s senior management are head of communications Scott Field and public affairs chief Rob Sullivan.

The number of times Australian Open finalists Novak Djokovic and Andy Murray made reference to the tournament sponsors during the presentations suggests Tennis Australia commercial director Richard Heaselgrave is faring better in Melbourne then he did at the Football League.

Heaselgrave was shown the door by the FL for a failed commercial strategy but has signed seven new tennis sponsors in his first year in Australia.

Sky fixing fixture farce

One benefit of Sky Sports broadcasting both The Open and England Test matches from 2016 is that the flagship Lord’s Test and the golf major will no longer clash — as they do this summer for the third year in a row and for a third successive Ashes series.

This ridiculous scheduling is blamed on Sky and the ECB by the R&A, whose Open dates are the same every year. However, after Sky secure both events this week when their Open deal is concluded, there is no chance of them being staged at the same time again.

Eleven months on from chairman Anthony Fry suffering the stroke that has prevented him returning to the role, the Premier League are still some way off finding his successor. Harrogate lawyer Peter McCormick continues as temporary chief despite the PL being his prime clients. 

Chelsea chairman Bruce Buck is taking responsibility for finding the next chairman. Chief executive Richard Scudamore being promoted to executive chairman still looks the most likely option.
