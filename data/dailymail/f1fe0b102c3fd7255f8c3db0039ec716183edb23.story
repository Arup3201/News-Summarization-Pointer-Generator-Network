So much for the best and the brightest!

Harvard students believe that American is a bigger threat to world peace than ISIS, according to a recent survey of attendees at the prestigious Cambridge university.

Campus Reform, a self-styled 'campus watchdog' for conservative students, carried out the interviews in the quad at the Ivy League school on Saturday and asked: ‘Who is the bigger threat to world peace, ISIS or the U.S.?’

The students featured in the video were overwhelming in their belief that America and its interventionist foreign policy is a greater threat than the group of Muslim fanatics that have gained global notoriety in recent months through a series of video of Western hostages being beheaded.

A group of Harvard students quizzed  overwhelmingly said that America rather than ISIS was a bigger threat

'We are, at some level, the cause of it,'  another student told interviewer Caleb Bonham

‘American imperialism and our protection of oil interests in the Middle East are destabilizing the region and allowing groups like ISIS to gain power,’ said one student.

'We are, at some level, the cause of it,' she adds.

'As a western civilization we’re to blame for a lot of the problems that we’re facing now,' said another student. 'I don't think anyone would argue that we didn't create the problem of ISIS, ourselves.'

The interviews were carried out by Caleb Bonham, editor of Campus Reform and a frequent guest on the Fox News Channel.

'In many ways I have to think it's America because America is making decisions that are much more likely to affect the world,' one student responds to Bonham's question.

'The amount of spending that America has on causes of potential destruction in the world is really outlandish,' she continues. 

After interviewing Harvard students, Campus Reform editor Caleb Bonham (right) was quick to be critical of their opinions and accused them of trying to be intellectual

'We've been learning about this recently how much america spends on defense mechanisms alone and it's really quite astounding compared to any other country in the world really.'

Another student tells Bonham: 'I just an interesting conversation last night with a couple of my neighbors and they can see how the ideology of ISIS might appeal to people in the Middle East who are not familiar with how we think as Americans.' 

'They have a skewed view of us just as a lot of Americans have a skewed view of them, he adds.

Bonham was highly critical of the student's responses.

‘This video demonstrates the absurdity behind the bash America fad,’ he told FoxNews.com. 

‘Unfortunately, too many students think it is intellectual to try and piece together a reason why America is a greater threat than this terrorist organization trying to establish a caliphate through public executions, bombings and beheadings.’

As one of the world's most prestigious universities, Harvard enjoys an almost unparalleled reputation in America.

It is the oldest academic institute in the United States, dating from 1636, and boats an impressive 210-acre main campus in Cambridge, Massachusetts.

The total cost of attending Harvard College without financial aid is $58,607 for tuition, room, board and fees combined, although that does not include books or personal expenses.

‘American imperialism and our protection of oil interests in the Middle East are destabilizing the region and allowing groups like ISIS to gain power,’ another student responded

In the past nine months, ISIS has taken key areas of Iraq, and large portions of Syria. It has also beheaded two Americans and threatened to kill more if the US continues to intervene in Iraq. 

The extremist group has stepped up its efforts to assume control of Syria in recent days, making a crippling assault on the city of Kobani.

This week, former Secretary of State Hillary Clinton warned  that ISIS is far more dangerous than previous terrorist groups, including the one that led the attacks on the World Trade Center on 9/11.

'It’s a serious threat because this is the best-funded, most professional, expansionist jihadist military force that we have ever seen,' Clinton told the Economic Club of Chicago, according to the Washington Post.

'This is far more advanced and far richer than al Qaeda ever was,' Clinton declared. 

Campus Reform promotes itself as a watchdog to the nation's higher education system and claims to exposes bias and abuse on the nation's college campuses. 

Bonham is a graduate of Colorado State University.

Campus Reform describes him as bringing 'his unique message, filled with introspection and humor, across the country speaking to young leaders and encouraging them to lead with the strength of their convictions'.
