Nicky Hilton has got engaged to James Rothschild.

The 30-year-old fashion designer and heiress, who has been in a relationship with the banker since meeting at Petra Ecclestone and James Stunt's Italy wedding in 2011, is 'incredibly happy' after he proposed to her in Lake Como last weekend.

A source close to the couple told UsMagazine.com: 'They went on a romantic anniversary trip over the weekend. He took her out on a boat into the middle of Lake Como and he proposed, got down on one knee and everything. It was incredibly romantic and beautiful.'

The insider added: 'They are both really excited and incredibly happy.

'They are going on a road trip now throughout Europe and celebrating.'

Indeed, Ms Hilton's Instagram feed appears to be testament to this. Over the past few days she has been posting idyllic-looking snaps from their tour.

Mr Rothschild, who is based in the UK, apparently started planning the special moment earlier this summer.

Ms Hilton - who is Paris Hilton's younger sister - has been married once before. In 2004, she wed childhood friend Todd Andrew Meister at the Las Vegas Wedding Chapel in Las Vegas.

The pair were granted an annulment just three months later after she admitted they had tied the knot 'on a whim.'
