A Spanish court says 'black box' data recorders show that a train driver was on the phone and traveling at 95 mph (153 kph), almost twice the speed limit, when the vehicle derailed, killing 79 people.

Investigators say the train had been going as fast as 119 mph shortly before the derailment and that Francisco Jose Garzon Amo activated the brakes 'seconds before the crash'.

In a statement, the court said Tuesday that the driver was talking on the phone to an official of national rail company Renfe when the crash happened and apparently was consulting a paper document at the time.

Investigators say train driver Francisco Garzon was on the phone to a colleague at the time of the smash

Questioning: Mr Garzon, who was released from hospital on Saturday but remained in police custody, arrived at Santiago de Compostela's main courthouse at 6:15pm yesterday in a police car with darkened windows

Earlier this week he was provisionally charged yesterday with multiple cases of negligent homicide.

A court statement said investigative magistrate Luis Alaez released him without bail.

The experienced driver was travelling at 
more than twice the 50mph limit permitted on a curve going into the city
 when the train careered off the track and smashed into a wall last 
Wednesday.

The statement said Mr Garzon must appear in court once a week and is forbidden to leave Spain without permission.

Mr Garzon was not sent to jail or 
required to post bail because none of the parties involved felt there 
was a risk of him fleeing or attempting to destroy evidence, the 
statement said.

It said the train driver's licence had also been withdrawn.

Mr Garzon was questioned for almost two 
hours at the court in Santiago de Compostela, the north-western town near
 where the accident occurred.

The death toll from Spain's worst 
train disaster in decades rose to 79 after one injured person died yesterday. Seventy people are in hospital with injuries from the crash. Twenty two are in critical condition.

After the accident, Mr Garzon spoke 
with both the train system control centre and emergency dispatchers, his
 face covered in blood from a head wound.

Transcripts reportedly revealed Mr 
Garzon recognised he was going too fast. Interior Minister Jorge 
Fernandez said on Saturday there was sufficient evidence to charge him with reckless homicide.

Mr Garzon, who was released from 
hospital on Saturday but remained in police custody, arrived at Santiago
 de Compostela's main courthouse at 6:15pm yesterday in a police car with 
darkened windows.

Neither lawyers nor 
members of Mr Garzon's family could be contacted for comment.

The judge will investigate the case 
and will also look at whether the train, the tracks or the security 
system that slows down the trains were at fault.

The Alvia train, one of three types of
 high speed train services that run in Spain, received a full 
maintenance check on the morning of the journey, the head of state train
 company RENFE said.

‘As far as we know the train was in perfect condition when it set off on its journey,’ Julio Gomez-Pomar told newspaper ABC, adding that security systems in place were in good shape.

The Alvia trains run both on 
traditional tracks, where drivers must heed warning systems to reduce 
speed, and on high-speed tracks where a more sophisticated security 
system will automatically slow down trains that are going too fast.

At the section of the track where the accident happened, it was up to the driver to respond to prompts to slow down.

But Mr Gomez-Pomar rejected criticism that the safety system was insufficient, saying the debate ‘does not make much sense’.

Santiago was meant to be celebrating 
the yearly festival of St James last Thursday, with thousands of 
Christian pilgrims arriving after walking the famous Camino de Santiago 
ancient pilgrimage trail.

Investigation: Emergency personnel work through the debris at the scene

Cause: An official inspects the train engine amongst the wreckage of a train crash

Ownership: The train, which belongs to the state-owned Renfe company, was not an AVE high speed train, but it was a relatively luxurious version that uses the same track as Spain's fastest expresses

Desperate effort: Emergency crews on the scene checking for survivors of the crash

A week of concerts and other cultural 
events were cancelled after the train crash on the eve of the Saint's 
day. Today, black ribbons of mourning hung on the empty stages that had 
been set up.

Pilgrims, many of them fresh off the 
trail and carrying backpacks, crammed into a standing-room-only Mass in 
Santiago's centuries-old cathedral where they remembered the victims of 
the accident.

At the gates, along with flowers and candles, some people left walking sticks from their journeys and others placed shells, the symbol of St James and badge of honour for the pilgrims who complete the journey.

Prime Minister Mariano Rajoy, who 
visited the crash site soon after the tragedy, is due to return tomorrow
 to Santiago, the city where he was born, for an official funeral 
ceremony for the victims.
