It may have seemed that Mr Spock’s Tricorder would remain firmly in science fiction.

But a gadget that can be used to diagnose an illness simply by holding it to the forehead, is now in the hands of consumers.

Named Scanadu Scout, the small round device is able to read a number of vital signs, including heart rate and temperature.

Scanadu Scout is a small round device that is able to read five vital signs, including heart rate and temperature. Its makers claim the device is 99 per cent accurate in less than 10 seconds. Most importantly, it is designed so that it doesn't need to be used by doctors

First unveiled at CES last year, the Silicon Valley-based firm behind Scanadu  won funding on crowdfunding site Kickstarter and the first batch of  devices were shipped in January.

It contains a variety of different sensors alongside a microphone on the top of the gadget that together, can read vital signs, including body temperature, heart rate, blood oxygen level, heart rate variability and pulse wave transit time (PWTT).

PWTT is the time it takes for a heartbeat to reach somewhere else in a person’s body and is related to blood pressure.

The Tricorder was used by Mr Spock (pictured) in Star Trek to wirelessly scanned a patient, either in a ‘sick bay’ on a star ship or during an away mission, to assess an individual’s medical status, and allow him to quickly and easily diagnose their condition without an intensive or invasion examination

A Tricorder is a scanning device used by Starfleet personnel in the Star Trek universe.

There are two variations; a regular (engineering) Tricorder and a medical Tricorder.

Medical Tricorders are used to wirelessly scan a patient, either in a ‘sick bay’ on a star ship or during an away mission.

The scanning tool can determine a patient’s medical status, and allows doctors to quickly and easily diagnose their condition without an intensive or invasion examination. 

The company's website said: 'As if it is reading your mind, the Scanadu Scout provides valuable data about your body. All that information just by placing it on your forehead.' 

Its makers claim the device is 99 per cent accurate in less than 10 seconds.

Medical data is stored on a smartphone app that patients can use to monitor their health, or can be shared with doctors .

The device uses a micro-USB adapter that can be hooked into a USB port, and it takes less than an hour to charge the battery.

When it is being used a few times every day, the battery lasts for about a week, the firm says.

Walter De Brouwer, a Belgian entrepreneur based at Nasa’s Ames Research Centre in California, who is behind the device, was inspired by Dr Spock’s Tricorder. 

‘Star Trek was more than just a movie, it was a business plan,’ he told CNN’s Nick Glass.

However, Scanadu was designed to be used by non-medical professionals.

De Brouwer said: ‘We've medicalised your smartphone. You can now check your health as easily as your email.

‘People will no longer ask if there's a doctor on the plane, but if there's a Tricorder.’

The device is not yet able to be purchased and is pending FDA approval, but  some people who obtained the device via Kickstarter have taken to Twitter to share their thoughts.

Scanadu is a finalist in the Qualcomm Tricorder X Prize, which was launched in 2013 to inspire a wireless device capable of detecting a range of diseases, like a Star Trek Tricorder (pictured)

David Sammuels MD tweeted: ‘It's finally here. @scanadu scout. Easy to use. Accurate readings of EKG HR SaO2 temp and BP. #mHealth #cdom’

Scanadu is also working on another device called Scanaflo – a urine test that could be used at home.

But De Brouver thinks in just a decade from now, we will be using silicon lasers to diagnose ailments so that medical data could be taken simply by passing through a beam.

Scanadu is a finalist in the Qualcomm Tricorder X Prize, which was launched in 2013 to inspire a wireless device capable of detecting a range of diseases, including anaemia, tuberculosis and diabetes.

According to the rules, finalists must demonstrate their devices on humans this year and three winners will be announced in 2016, with a top prize of £4.3 million ($7 million).

To win the cash prize, the device has to monitor vital signs as well as diagnose 16 different conditions.

Another device by London-based, ScanNurse, uses computer-vision techniques to analyse images taken with a camera.

The scientists hope their system will make observations of the inside of the ears or throat, say – in the same way a doctor would – and then feed it into a computer for analysis.

Other teams are using blood and urine samples to test for key markers. The tiny microfluidic devices will, they claim, work in a similar way to hospital-lab tests.

DMI, for instance, has teamed teamed up with Nasa to create a device that astronauts could use to monitor their health on long trips and in zero gravity.

Doctors and medical engineers point out that much of the technology is already proven available to use separately.

For instance, light sensors can now track blow flow and oxygen levels within the human body. Other sensors can be used to detect gases in breath that may indicate certain diseases. 

Team Aezon are the youngest team competing for the Qualcomm Tricorder XPrize. Aezon's solution is a monitoring device (pictured) designed to gather five different vital signs at once, to be worn around the neck
