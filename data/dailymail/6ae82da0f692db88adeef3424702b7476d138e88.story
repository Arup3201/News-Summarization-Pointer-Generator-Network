Michael Egan III, the child model who accused several Hollywood figures of sexually abusing him, accepted a $100,000 settlement from X-Men director Bryan Singer only to back out at the 11th hour, it has emerged.

The strange manoeuvre is said to have cost Egan his lawyer.

Egan recently dropped three lawsuits against other men he claimed abused him during a trip to Hawaii in 1999 when he was 17, leaving only Singer.

TMZ reports that Egan's lawyer, Jeff Herman, approached Singer's lawyer, Marty Singer, offering to drop the case for $100,000.

It also notes that a $100K settlement payment would be far less than Singer would spend in legal fees defending against the claims and would be viewed as a nuisance payment.

Dismissed: Michael Egan III, who filed four lawsuits against four Hollywood figures but dropped three of them, dismissed a $100,000 settlement offer from the remaining accused, Bryan Singer

Accused: TMZ reports that Hollywood director Brian Singer offered $100,000 to close the sexual abuse lawsuit, but the deal fell through at the last-minute

However, after the settlement was signed, Egan changed his mind and reneged, according to the tabloid site.

'This exact kind of take-it-and-shut-up deal is why I decided to stand up in the first place,' he said.

Herman, apparently wanting the lawsuit to be done with, has now backed out completely, according to TMZ.

Last month, Egan dismissed a lawsuit against theater producer Gary Wayne Goddard.

Egan's lawyers did not explain why 
they dropped the lawsuit in their two-page filing, saying only that the 
matter was dismissed without prejudice, meaning Egan can refile the 
lawsuit if he chooses.

He
 filed suit under an unusual state law that created a window for civil 
lawsuits in sex abuse cases where the statute of limitations has passed.

The men have denied 
the allegations, and Singer has filed a motion to dismiss the lawsuit 
against him. A hearing is set in the Singer case for August 4.

Also last month, Egan dropped a lawsuit against Garth Ancier.

Suing: Garth Ancier says Mike Egan and his attorneys knew a lawsuit accusing him of sexual molestation when Egan was a teenager was false

The
 former network TV executive filed a malicious-prosecution lawsuit 
against Egan saying the accusations had damaged his reputation.

Mr
 Ancier, 56, who was a high-ranking executive at the NBC, Fox and WB 
networks, filed his lawsuit in a federal court in Honolulu two days 
after Michael Egan III, 31, voluntarily dismissed his case.

Ancier
 lawsuit states his reputation was damaged by Egan's claims that he was 
sexually molested by the executive and other entertainment industry 
figures, including

Ancier said he never visited the estate in Hawaii where Egan claims he was abused.

Ancier is seeking punitive damages. He claimed he has already spent hundreds of thousands of dollars defending himself.

Ancier and X-Men director Bryan Singer have denied being in Hawaii at the time Egan says he was abused.

Ancier's suit claims that Egan and his attorney sought to 'smear, harass and severely injure Mr Ancier as part of an avowed and 
very public campaign by Mr Eganâ€™s counsel to troll for new clients who 
would enable them to shake down other entertainment industry executives 
with threats of sexual assault charges.'

Egan's
 attorneys did not respond to requests by Ancier's attorneys to produce 
evidence that supported the sex abuse lawsuit, the new case states.

Ancier was in Los Angeles and New York developing lineups of shows for 
NBC at the time Egan claims he was abused.

'This fabrication of facts in Hawaii 
that never took place, to create jurisdiction in a forum where there was
 none and to drum up more business for Mr Egan's counsel, requires that 
defendants be held to account for malicious prosecution and abuse of 
process,' the lawsuit states.

'Mike
 Egan maintains that he was sexually abused by Garth Ancier in both 
Hawaii and California. Prior to filing the case in Hawaii, Mike was 
examined by a psychologist who made findings that supports Mike's 
claims,' Herman wrote in an email. 'This is nothing more than an attempt
 to silence victims.'

Egan 
sued Ancier, Singer and two other entertainment industry figures in May,
 just days before a law that extended the statute of limitations on 
sex-abuse lawsuits in Hawaii expired.

Egan
 withdrew the lawsuit against Ancier on Wednesday, three weeks after he 
withdrew a similar suit against David Neuman, another former TV 
executive. Singer has filed a motion to dismiss the lawsuit against him.
