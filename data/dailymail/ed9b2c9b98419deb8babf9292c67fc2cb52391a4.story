A mother and a stepfather are facing child abuse and neglect charges after a three-year-old boy was found with burns on '85 per cent of his body'.

Nakita Morton, 22, left her son Zander Brown alone with 31-year-old Eric Morton at the home they shared with her parents in Campbell County, Tennessee, on the morning of September 16.

At some point before 10am, the boy suffered second-degree burns to his head, neck, chest, abdomen, back and legs while in Eric's care, officials said.

Zander's uncle, David Brown, said the burns covered around 85 per cent of his body, saying: 'Basically from his nose up is all that's not burned. Everything is burned.'

Awaiting trial: When Nakita (left) returned, Eric (right) told her about Zander's injuries, but they did not seek medical treatment, it is alleged. The couple are now facing charges of child abuse and neglect

When Nakita  returned, Eric told her about the injuries, but they did not seek medical treatment for fear of children's services or law enforcement officials getting involved, it is alleged.

Even when Nakita's father arrived home at 11am and suggested taking Zander to hospital, Eric reportedly refused to permit it. The same happened at 11.30am, when Nakita's mother returned.

It was only shortly after 12.30pm that the couple allowed Zander's grandparents to take him to LaFollette Medical Center, where he was also found to have bruises on various parts of his body.

The boy was then airlifted to Vanderbilt University hospital, according to WATE.com. 

Innocent: Following an examination at the hospital, Zander's burns were found to not be accidental nor self-inflicted, but intentional. The three-year-old (pictured) remains in a critical but stable condition at hospital

Following an examination at the hospital, Zander's burns were found to not be accidental nor self-inflicted, but intentional.  Officials agreed the injuries did not appear consistent with an accident.

Zander remains in a critical but stable condition at hospital, Campbell County Sheriff's Office said.

In the wake of Zander's examinations, Nakita and Eric were arrested by police. Eric has since been charged with aggravated child neglect for allegedly failing or refusing to provide medical treatment.

He has also been accused of aggravated child abuse by intentionally burning his stepson, although it is not clear in what way he might have caused the burns. 

Jail: Nakita and Eric, both of whom deny the charges, are being held at Campbell County Jail (pictured)

Meanwhile, Nicki has been charged with aggravated child neglect for the same reason as her husband. The couple, both of whom deny the charges, are being held at Campbell County Jail.

Judge Amanda Sammons has set their bail at $750,000 each and appointed them both attorneys, according to WBIR.com.

Speaking this week, Campbell County Sheriff Robbie Goins said he was determined to get justice for Zander, saying: 'We feel like we're his voice and we want to get him justice.'

He added: 'We are saddened by the horrific acts that we believe this child suffered through the abuse and neglect of both individuals respectively charged in this crime.

'Unspeakable acts of child abuse and neglect will not stand by any of us. Our prayers will continue to flow above for this child's care, health, and full recovery.'
