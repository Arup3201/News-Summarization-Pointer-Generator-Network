A Sydney mother, who pleaded guilty to the manslaughter of a police officer in 2012, sent emails to the Prime Minister and the Russian President in which she defended herself and demanded asylum.

Fiona Barbieri, 47, and her 21-year-old son Mitchell, attended their sentencing hearing in Sydney's Supreme Court on Wednesday, where the full details surrounding the death of Detective Inspector Bryson Anderson were revealed.

Inspector Anderson died after he was fatally stabbed by then 19-year-old Mitchell Barbieri following a siege at a rural Oakville property in Sydney's north-west on December 6, 2012.

The police interview of Fiona Barbieri after her arrest in 2012, following the death of a policeman at her  property in Sydney's north-west, was shown to Sydney's Supreme Court on Wednesday

During a police interview following the Barbieri's arrests in 2012, the 47-year-old mother who is believed to have been suffering from paranoid schizophrenia, told officers that Inspector Anderson had been killed in self-defence before demanding asylum in Russia.

In the footage of the police interview attained by Channel Nine, Fiona is heard saying: 'what happened at our house today, where we were ambushed by an army of police officers, was self-defence.'

She is then handed a telephone by the officers who allow her to call the consulate, to whom she says: 'It is the Barbieris, president Putin, SOS Australia.' 

According to Channel Nine, Fiona was advised by the consulate to forward her request via email, after which she refused to answer further questions from the policemen.

'We are living here in convict Australia, corrupt convict Australia, and we have been doing our best to get out,' she told officers.

'The New South Wales police force is corrupt - that is what we have been standing up against and that is why we are in here today.' 

Crown prosecutor Mark Tedeschi QC told the Supreme Court on Wednesday that Fiona and her son had been embroiled in a long-running dispute with their neighbour, which had been fuelled by Ms Barbieri's paranoia.

On December 6, the tension spiralled out of control when the Barbieris spotted that Mr Waters was installing flood lights on his property.

Fiona - swinging a baseball bat - and Mitchell - armed with a crossbow - confronted the electricians working for Mr Waters.

Earlier in the month, the Barbieris cried and hugged in the dock as they prepared to plea to their roles in the death of Detective Inspector Anderson

Mitchell fired two arrows, narrowly missing them both, before he and his mother retreated into their home.

As the first police arrived, the court heard the Barbieris sent an email to a number of politicians, including then opposition leader Tony Abbott and Russian President Vladimir Putin, saying: 'We have every right to defend ourselves, our family and our property.'

Just over an hour later, it had become a 'siege situation' with Fiona and Mitchell screaming at police to 'f*** off'.

Det Insp Anderson ordered the door to be kicked in and was stabbed twice by Mitchell - once in the cheek and fatally to the chest, Mr Tedeschi said.

As he lay dying, the court heard that Fiona was heard screaming, 'it's his own f****** fault.. he fucking deserved it… let the dog c*** die… he deserves to f****** die'.

The policemand wife Donna, said her husband absolutely adored their three children

On the morning they were due to stand trial last week, Mitchell pleaded guilty to the officer's murder, while his mother - who suffers from paranoid schizophrenia - pleaded guilty to manslaughter on the grounds of substantial impairment.

Under legislation passed before parliament, a person convicted of the murder of a police officer while on duty faces a mandatory life sentence.

But Mr Tedeschi said this was not a situation where life imprisonment should apply as Mitchell was influenced by his mother's delusions.

'He (Mitchell) had been under the influence of his mother ... and her delusions had to some degree been transferred to him,' Mr Tedeschi said.

Olivia, Cain and Darcy could not speak highly enough of their deceased father

At officer Anderson's 2012 funeral, NSW Police Commissioner Andrew Scipione said the decorated officer was greatly admired by his fellow officers

Instead, he said the crown would be seeking a 'very lengthy' sentence.

Earlier in the month, Inspector Anderson's family honoured the man who was a much-loved husband and father of three.

Bryson's widow Donna Anderson and their three children Olivia, Darcy and Cain could not wipe the smiles off their faces when they told fond stories of how Bryson was always the larrikin of the family.

'There was the policeman side to him which was incredibly serious – he took his job very seriously -but there was the family side of him where he was just the clown in every family gathering,' Donna told Channel Nine's ACA. 

'He just absolutely adored his kids,' she said. He was a typical dad - he loved dad jokes and if he could embarrass the kids in front of their friends that was even better.'

The family privately continue to struggle with their loss, and it will be some time before they finally come to terms with the tragedy

His three children could not speak highly enough of their father.

'He would totally just love life - it was awesome,' his only daughter Olivia said. 'Yes, he liked to embarrass us.'

His eldest son, Darcy said he was a great dad who was always a joker.

'He photo bombed a lot – my first cricket game in my photo – he was in the background,' he said.

'Cricket is my life – me and dad built the pitch out the front in 2003 I think.'

'We got tonnes of dirt and just rolled it and got it all padded down and I just keep mowing it in.'

'He would totally just love life - it was awesome,' his only daughter Olivia (left) said. 'Yes, he liked to embarrass us' 

Bryson's family described him as a joker who had a great sense of humour

'He was always a joker – he photo-bombed a lot,' his youngest son Cain said. 

While being dedicated to his family and career, he also managed to squeeze in volunteering with the Special Olympics, travelling to Vanuatu to give gifts to children and also volunteering as a firefighter.

'He would come home from the police sometimes he would only be there for an hours or so and then the bells would go off and he would go out to a fire call and he did that for nine years,' Donna said.

During the committal hearing last year, a number of police officers broke down as they recalled the murder.   

At Detective Inspector Anderson's 2012 funeral, NSW Police Commissioner Andrew Scipione said the decorated officer was admired by his fellow officers for his tenacity and determination, as well as his empathy and compassion.

'He showed initiative and leadership; intelligence and perseverance; dedication and humility; and, memorably, a ready smile and an engaging way.

'Bryson drew people to him, without guile and without effort.' 

The matter will return to court later this month.
