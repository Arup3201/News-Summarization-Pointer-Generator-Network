It took 10 people, a fibreglass boat and an excavator to cage two Queensland crocodiles - one of them 5m long -  so they could catch a flight to their new home at Dubai's largest shopping centre.

After a 16-hour flight and two-hour layover in Singapore, Jock the croc and his girlfriend will take centre stage at The Dubai Mall's Dubai Aquarium and Discovery Centre.

It's a far cry from their home at Koorana Crocodile Farm at Coowonga, near Rockhampton, where the pair have been together for 15 years.

Jock the croc and his girlfriend took to the skies on Thursday en route to their new home at The Dubai Mall's Dubai Aquarium and Discovery Centre

Animal handlers started loading Jock - who is 40 years old and weighs 750kg - and his mate onto a Main Freight truck on Tuesday night and both were on their way by Wednesday morning, arriving in Brisbane about 7pm on the same day.

They took flight about 2.30am on Thursday and will arrive 18 hours later.

But the lovebirds did not travel alone. They had some race horses to keep them company.

Koorana Crocodile Farm's Lillian Lever said her husband, two sons, four staff members, a Melbourne Aquarium vet, a Main Freight employee who built the cages, and the CEO of the Dubai Aquarium and Zoo were on hand to help with the mammoth effort. She said it took them six hours from the start of the caging process until the the final croc, Jock, was boxed.

Ms Lever's sons had to stand in the boat and rope Jock in.

'(We used) manpower to drag him over the mud into the cage and one excavator to lift the cage and take it to the transport cage,' she said.

Without giving too much away, Main Freight perishables branch manager Justin Keir said the crocs were loaded into special built crates.

The crocs were loaded up on the Koorana Crocodile Farm near Rockhampton and travelled to Brisbane on a Main Freight truck on Wednesday

'We specialise in (animal transport) so asking about it is like asking the colonel about his 11 herbs and spices (at KFC),' he said.

'They were in crates that have a controlled atmosphere so they were able to be kept warm.'

Despite having transported other unusual cargo, Mr Keir said this one was by far the most unique.

'We do a lot of penguins - we have a purpose built crates one for penguins - and snakes,' he said.

'The crocs would have to be at the top of the list of unusual things we’ve done.'

Ms Lever's husband, John, told The Morning Bulletin this was the first time their crocodiles had been sent overseas.

It also means a part of Central Queensland will be at the mall - about 12,000km away from Australia - that had more than 75 million visitors in 2013.

Jock the croc is more than 5m long, weighs 750kg and is 40 years old - and still has 20 or 30 years of growth left in him

Mr Lever said part of the sale of the crocs to the mall was to promote Koorana and the region.

The offer came after the farm had a croc take up residence at the Melbourne Aquarium in 2013.

Jock was caught after he was sighted in Chinaman's Creek in Cairns during the 1980s.

Similar croc tales to Jock's capture are chronicled in Kissed by a Croc - Mr Lever's autobiography he co-authored with Jenny Lanyon. It was launched as an ABC book on June 1.

Jock and his girlfriend will be renamed by their new owners.
