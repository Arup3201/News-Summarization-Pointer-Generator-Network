Naushad Faruk, pictured, convinced a glamour model to pose for pictures on the promise of a feature in Loaded, a court was told

A man duped a famous glamour model into stripping off for the camera by falsely offering her a spread in men's magazine Loaded, a court heard today.

Naushad Faruk, 32, convinced the 26-year-old to pose for pictures on the promise of a feature in Loaded, Highbury Corner Magistrates Court was told.

Faruk had no links with Loaded but had created a fake email address to keep up the pretence, it was claimed.

A stylist was also lured to the shoot, which is said to have taken place at a plush flat in London’s Mayfair district in February of this year, the court heard.

Faruk also secretly taped women performing sex acts on him on a secret camera hidden in his watch, it was claimed.

Wearing a goatee beard and his hair in a slicked-back pony tail, Faruk denied the charges through his advocate, Sarah-Jane Connolly.

Prosecutor Priya Valentine said: ‘It is said he purported to be a member of staff employed by the magazine Loaded, which, I understand, is a mens’ magazine.

‘He has then set up a false email address and through that he has arranged the photo shoot with the two complainants.’

‘They took part in the photo shoot because they thought they would have a spread in the magazine.’

Miss Valentine said: ‘In relation to the voyeurism, it is said that Mr Faruk was engaged in sexual activity with three complainants, and during it, it is said that he has recorded their sexual activity, unbeknown to the females.’

‘The recording device is said to have been contained in his watch.’

At least one of the allegations is said to have occurred while Faruk visited a brothel, the court heard.

Chair of the bench, magistrate Mel Bryant, committed the case to the Crown Court.

Faruk, of Barnet, north London, denies three charges of voyeurism and two charges of fraud by false representation.

He was granted conditional bail and will next appear at Blackfriars Crown Court on 2 September for a preliminary hearing.
