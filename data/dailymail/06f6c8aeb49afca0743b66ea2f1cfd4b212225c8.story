The head of the NHS should resign over the 'deeply questionable' decision to suspend children's heart surgery at Leeds General Infirmary, it was claimed today.

Sir Bruce Keogh, the NHS's medical director, is under fire for his decision which came just a day after plans to close the unit were quashed in the High Court.

The hospital was forced to close the unit yesterday after data emerged suggesting it had a death rate twice the national average.

NHS bosses are conducting an internal review of the data, which is expected to 
last several weeks.

Leeds General Infirmary was forced to close its children's heart unit after data emerged showing an unexpectedly high mortality rate

The hospital is at the centre of a 
long-running row over the future of its children's heart services and 
critics have questioned the timing of the closure - just 24 hours after a High Court judge declared the decision-making process to close the children's unit was 'legally flawed'.

But the report's author today warned that the findings were only 'preliminary' and needed further validation.

And today, Dr John Gibbs, chairman of the steering 
committee for the Central Cardiology Audit Database (CCAD), which 
supplied the data, said the mortality figures were preliminary and had 
not undergone the 'usual rigorous checking process'.

'I'm absolutely furious,' he said. 'This data was not fit to looked at by anyone outside the committee.

'It was at a very preliminary stage and we are at the start of a long 
process to make sure the data was right and the methodology was correct.

'We would be irresponsible if we didn't put in every effort to get the data right.'

Dr Gibbs said the 'ground-breaking' study involved complex analysis which would require at least two months to validate.

A problem had already been identified with the figures, he added, with some data being incorrectly discounted from results.

Speaking on the BBC Radio 4 Today programme this morning, Sir Bruce Keogh, the medical director of NHS England, defended his controversial decision. 

He said the figures were among a 
'constellation of reasons' behind the suspension and there were 
'rumblings' among the cardiac surgical community for some time that 'all
was not well' in Leeds.

Conflict: Sir Bruce Keogh's decision to close the unit came just 24 hours after Mrs Justice Nicola Davies ruled further consultation was necessary

He
said: 'On Tuesday, I had two phone calls which I found disturbing, both
from highly respected temperate surgeons who commenced the 
conversations by saying they had to speak out.'

One raised concerns about the 
referrals process at the hospital and the other spoke to him about 
staffing levels, Sir Bruce said.

That was followed by preliminary data
on mortality that was 'considerably' higher - around twice the national
average - than any other unit.

A campaigner fighting to keep children’s heart surgery at Leeds General Infirmary said she felt ‘sick’ when she heard it had been suspended to allow a review of death rates.

Stephanie Ward, 45, has been campaigning for several years to ensure the Infirmary remains open after her three-year-old son Lyall received treatment there that saved his life.

She said: 'I first heard the news last night and I was extremely shocked, especially as it came the day after the High Court scrapped the plans to close it.

'I felt sick when the story broke. Heart surgery isn’t like having your tooth out, it’s one of the worst things a family could possibly ever go through.

'Leeds was declared safe in all wards recently and to close the infirmary based on unsubstantiated evidence and flawed material stinks, to be honest.

'The judge at the High Court lambasted the proposal to close the infirmary, but this latest setback has left us in shock,' she said.

Ms Ward was pregnant with Lyall, who has Down’s Syndrome, when he was diagnosed with a heart condition.

In January 2010, he had corrective open heart surgery at Leeds General Infirmary.

'Without it, he would have died, no doubt about it,' she said.

'Luckily for us he’s OK now, but this ward closing means families will have to  go to Newcastle or Liverpool, which are over an hour away.'

He added: 'I couldn't do nothing. I 
was really disturbed about the timing of this. I couldn't sit back just 
because the timing was inconvenient, awkward or would look suspicious, 
as it does.'

It is understood the alarm was raised when auditors spotted that the mortality rate in the department was higher than expected.

There were also suspicions that the LGI was not referring complex cases on to other centres with better expertise - such as the Freeman Hospital in Newcastle.

And on Sunday, it was revealed an unnamed
surgeon - only one of four in the department - had been suspended while
'aspects of his practise' were investigated.

The hospital admitted the consultant was already under an earlier restriction from carrying out certain procedures.

But Greg
Mulholland, MP for Leeds North West, said he was 'stunned and appalled'
by the suspension and called for Sir Bruce to resign.

The MP said he understood the medical
director of NHS England and senior members of the Care Quality 
Commission arrived at LGI yesterday morning to demand that children's 
heart surgery cease.

In a 
statement on his website, Mr Mulholland said: 'To have arrived in Leeds 
and done this, without warning, just one day after the decision to close
the Leeds unit was proved in a court of law to have been unlawful 
beggars belief.

'I believe that Sir Bruce Keogh should 
resign as he has both authorised this wholly unreasonable and deeply 
questionable action and also presided over the fundamentally flawed Safe
and Sustainable review, which has proved an exercise in how not to 
effect major change to the NHS.'

The
department is already under pressure after it emerged on Sunday that 
one of its senior surgeons has been banned from operating.

It also narrowly escaped closure on Wednesday when Mrs Justice Nicola Davies ruled further consultation was necessary.

Yesterday's review was ordered after hospital bosses met with officials from NHS England and the Care Quality Commission.

Leeds Teaching Hospitals NHS Trust said it would be 'independently validated' and supported by external experts.

NHS England said the closure was taken as a 'precautionary step' to ensure the safety of child patients.

Sir Bruce added: 'Some questions have been raised by the trust's own mortality data and by other information.

'It is important to understand that while this information raises questions, it does not give us answers.

'But it is absolutely right not to take any risks while these matters are being looked into.

'The priority must be the safety of children.'

There were also suspicions that the LGI was not referring complex cases on to other centres with better expertise - such as the Freeman Hospital in Newcastle (pictured)

Stuart Andrew, Conservative MP for Pudsey, told BBC Breakfast that the situation was 'all very odd'.

He said that the day after the High Court Judgement had ruled it was unlawful to take heart surgery away from Leeds, Sir Bruce Keogh had been up to the hospital and surgery had been suspended.

He added: 'We have always asked "is it safe at Leeds" and the answer has always been yes.'

He also questioned the reliability of the data indicating high mortality rates. 

It has also emerged that surgeons who
were performing congenital heart surgery over the period the mortality 
figures relate to have since moved on, and are working at units in other
parts of the country.

The 
Trust is currently contacting all families whose children were due to 
undergo heart treatment at the hospital to make alternative 
arrangements.

Maggie Boyle, chief executive of the 
Trust, said: 'This will look at all aspects of congenital cardiac 
surgery for children undertaken at the unit in Leeds.

'We
have taken the decision to temporarily pause children's congenital 
cardiac surgery and associated interventions while this review is 
conducted, a process we would aim to complete in around three weeks.

Children who were due to undergo heart treatment at Leeds will now have it at other centres

'We apologise to parents and families who will be affected during this time, and can assure them we always put the safety of our patients first.

'It is really important to us that the review is done as speedily and comprehensively as possible which, of course, we hope will show the services in Leeds to be safe.'

Last year, the Children's Heart 
Federation said it had 'major concerns' about standards of care at 
Leeds, claiming some babies had been sent home to die and called for an 
investigation following feedback from parents.

The
safety of children's heart surgery at Leeds was also raised two years 
ago with the Care Quality Commission health watchdog when a report found
there had been 20 'excess' or unexpected deaths over eight years to 
2008.

Leeds is one of three children's heart units to be closed after a review in the wake of the Bristol heart scandal in the Nineties in which 35 babies died and dozens more were left brain-damaged.

It sparked a change in the way mortality rates in hospitals are monitored, especially in cardiac care.

In recent months, a huge legal campaign, backed by publicity, has been mounted to keep heart surgery at Leeds following last year's Safe and Sustainable NHS review, which recommended all surgery be transferred to better-equipped Newcastle.

But a number of independent experts have spoken in favour of closure, stressing there were 'serious issues' at the unit.
