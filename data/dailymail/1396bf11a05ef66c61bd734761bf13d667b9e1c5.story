A mother taking her son to school has been arrested for drink driving at 7.30am.

Deborah Arnett was spotted speeding through a school zone at 40mph on Friday and allegedly refused to pull over whilst being chased by a police car.

The 52-year-old led the police car down several roads in Rock Hill, South Carolina, before coming to a stop.

When the police officer opened the driver's door Arnett said she was trying to take her 10 year old son to school.

A sobriety test was administered, and Arnett showed several signs of impairment, according to an arrest report.

The officer then searched the minivan, and found a water bottle with beer in it, the report states.

Arnett refused a breath test, stating she had 'too much last night, and nothing to eat.'

Arnett was arrested and charged with failure to stop for a blue light and siren, child endangerment, and DUI.

Police said a patrol car noticed Arnett speeding at 40mph in an area where the speed limit was 25mph.

The area had a restricted speed limit in place because it is a school zone.

Arnett allegedly refused to pull over even though the officer had switched on his flashing lights.
