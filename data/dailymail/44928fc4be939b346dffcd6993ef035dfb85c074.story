Many parents are failing to protect themselves against the sun because they are focusing on their children, a charity has warned.

A poll of 950 parents found that 74 per cent always make sure their youngsters are wearing sun cream which is at least factor 15.

However, that leaves a significant number of one in four that do not.

Fun in the sun: But many parents are forgetting to slap on the sun cream because they are focusing on the kids

And 47 per cent said they often forget to use sun cream themselves because they are too busy concentrating on their child’s skin.

Only 55 per cent always make sure their child spends some time in the shade and 62 per cent that their child covers up with clothing or a hat.

Cancer Research UK carried out the survey with Nivea Sun. The charity is urging people to use sunscreen of at least factor 15, seek shade during the hottest parts of the day and to wear protective clothing. 

'Parents need to practise what they preach and take care of their skin too,' said Sarah Williams, senior health information officer at Cancer Research UK.

'It was particularly worrying to see that while out in strong sun only a quarter of parents surveyed always cover up with clothing or a hat as this is one of the best ways to protect your skin.

'We want to help parents set an example so that their children have a healthy attitude towards the sun. 

'Using a combination of shade, clothing and at least factor 15 sunscreen will help protect skin from harmful UV rays that can not only cause premature ageing and wrinkles, but can also increase the risk of skin cancer.'
