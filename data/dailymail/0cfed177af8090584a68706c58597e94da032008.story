America’s first female astronaut, Sally Ride, was a brilliant physicist who broke through NASA’s glass ceiling before going on to devote her life to inspiring girls to take up science.

But it wasn’t until after Ride's death in July 2012, following a 17-month battle with pancreatic cancer, that the world – and most people who knew her – discovered that she had been living with a woman for 27 years.

Ride’s sexuality is one of number of secrets revealed in a new book, Sally Ride: America’s First Woman In Space, written by former ABC News correspondent Lynn Sherr.

The two women became close friends in the early 1980s when Sherr was covering the space program for ABC News.

The biography also explores the chronic shyness that caused Ride to seek psychiatric help amid the overwhelming public attention that surrounded her return from space in 1983.

Despite her shyness, Ride attended a secret meeting with a Russian female cosmonaut at the height of the Cold War, against strict orders from the State Department.

Later, during the investigation into the Challenger explosion in 1986, Ride acquired and then leaked a key document showing that NASA management had prior knowledge of the faulty equipment believed to have led to the disaster.

‘She was the person I thought she was,’ Sherr told the L.A. Times. ‘But she was much more. She had so much more to her.’

Like most people, Sherr only learned about Ride’s 27 year relationship with her partner, Tam O'Shaughnessy, after the former astronaut died of pancreatic cancer in 2012, aged just 61 years old.

'Sally was very good at keeping secrets,' writes Sherr on her book. 

Despite spending much of her life on the public stage, Ride was an introvert and fiercely private person.

She and O'Shaughnessy first met in 
their teens when both were aspiring tennis players, although Ride had several relationships with men before the friends started an intimate relationship.

According 
to O'Shaughnessy, the couple kept their relationship a secret throughout
 Ride’s life for fear it wouldn’t be accepted and concern over the 
impact it would have on their business. 

The pair co-founded Sally Ride Science, a program aimed at encouraging young girls to explore science, in 2001.

Ride’s sexuality is one of number of secrets revealed in a new book, Sally Ride: America’s First Woman In Space, written by former ABC News correspondent Lynn Sherr, right

'We both lived through Billie Jean's 
horrors, of being gay and being in the public eye. And we both were 
afraid it would hurt the business. So we elected to be private about 
it.' Tam O'Shaughnessy, Sally Ride's lover

'Corporate America is really nervous about gay women,' O'Shaughnessy told Sherr.

'When we started Sally Ride Science, we were just worried that it would affect the growth of the company, the sponsorships.

'We both lived through Billie Jean's horrors, of being gay and being in the public eye. And we both were afraid it would hurt the business. So we elected to be private about it.'

Like many 
gay people of their generation, both Ride and O'Shaughnessy felt 
uncomfortable about openly expressing their sexuality in public.

'We
 never publicly said, "We're gay." We didn't like labels of any kind, 
but especially the ones referring to sexuality: queer, lesbian, 
homosexual,' said O'Shaughnessy.

The couple were good friends with Billie Jean King, who was outed in 1981, although the former tennis star tells Sherr that Ride never asked what effect coming out had had on King's career.

'Never.
 I thought it was weird,' said King. 'Selfishly I thought it would be 
great if Sally came out, and if Tam came out, but I knew they weren't 
there. I thought it would be great for an example of being gay and 
powerful and all the wonderful things, to be yourself and to be 
authentic.'

'But it's easy for me to say, I'm in a different place. When you're not in that place, you're just frightened.'

Returning hero: Ride gets a big hug from her astronaut husband Steven Hawley. The couple divorced after five years of marriage. 'I believe that Sally did love me when we got married,' he said

Ride left NASA in 1987 and in 2001 she co-founded the Sally Ride Science, a program aimed at encouraging young girls to explore science, along with her partner

Ride’s overwhelming need for privacy is a reoccurring theme throughout the book.

Sherr describes her as a 'resolutely guarded' person and writes that ‘while Tam (O'Shaughnessy) kept nothing from her best buddies, Sally told no one, not even the insiders.’

A friend of O'Shaughnessy says that around other people a lot of the relationship ‘was about looks and actions, not words.’

'I never heard Sally say, "I love you," to Tam,’ said Kay Loveland. ‘But you could tell they were in love by the way they would touch each other when they'd go by.’

Although the 'superb compartmentalizer' Ride never publicly acknowledged her sexuality and her relationship with O'Shaughnessy, the situation was different away from the spotlight.

Among their close group of friends - gay and straight - the couple were far from closeted. They regularly traveled together, staying together in hotels and attending public functions together, even attending each other's university events.

The pair also wore matching rings - each on the fourth finger of their left hand.

While still a student at Stanford University, Ride was one of 8,000 people who answered an advertisement in the student newspaper seeking applicants for the space program.

She was chosen to join NASA in 1978 and while she excelled at her work, her 'fiercely private' nature meant she struggled with the media attention that descended upon her after she was selected as America’s first female astronaut.

During press conferences, she was asked questions like, ‘Will the flight affect your reproductive organs?’ and ‘Do you weep when things go wrong on the job?’

Despite this and the historical significance of the mission, Ride insisted that she saw herself in only one way - as an astronaut.

A good example of Ride’s desire for privacy was her marriage in 1982, a year before her first flight, to fellow astronaut Steven Hawley.

The couple got married in secret at his parent’s house and the media was only informed until a month later.

Despite rumors that NASA had put pressure on Ride to marry ahead of her maiden space flight, her ex-husband denies it.

On June 18, 1983, Ride, then 32, became the first American woman in space as a crew member on space shuttle Challenger for STS-7

'I believe that Sally did love me when we got married,' said Hawley, 'and that she entered the marriage in good faith.'

The couple divorced five years later, just when Ride was leaving NASA, although they remained good friends throughout the rest of her life.

On June 18, 1983, Ride became the first American woman in space as a crew member on space shuttle Challenger for STS-7.

Aged 32, she was the first woman to use the robot arm in space and the first to use the arm to retrieve a satellite. She remains the youngest American astronaut to travel to space.

The mission went off without a hitch, but the problems for Ride started when she returned to earth to discover that everybody wanted a piece of her. Not a comfortable situation for a 'fiercely private individual'.

She was invited to the White House to meet President Regan and despite her reservations she carried out countless public appearances to help publicize the space program.

But as an introvert, Ride felt traumatized by all the public attention and confided in O'Shaughnessy that she felt she was ‘losing her equilibrium.’

Tam O'Shaughnessy prepares to accept the Presidential Medal of Freedom on behalf of Dr. Sally Ride from President Obama at the White House last November. Ride was awarded the highest civilian honor posthumously after she died from cancer in 2012

'I felt anxious and unsettled,' she told Tam. 'I knew I needed help.'

In her personal memo book, Ride called the attention 'draining' and wrote that she felt better in New York City. She described walking in NYC as 'therapeutic' – ‘the freedom, exercise, anonymity, in the midst of crowds.'

In a bid to cope she consulted a psychologist who ‘helped me figure out what to do.'

The final straw for Ride came when she was asked to appear on a Bob Hope TV special. Blast Off With Bob was a tribute to NASA and Ride was adamant that she didn't want to appear on it.

Telling her bosses 'I don't like the way he exploits women.’

In the end she went AWOL rather than appear alongside the showbiz legend.

As an introvert, Ride felt traumatized by all the public attention that she received and she felt she was 'losing her equilibrium'

Ride flew Challenger once again in 1984, but in 1986 the space shuttle tragically exploded 73 seconds after launch. She was the only serving astronaut appointed to the investigation committee.

At the same time her marriage to Hawley started to come apart, and she secretly began her relationship with O'Shaughnessy.

To have the personal life she wanted, Ride had to forge a career outside of NASA and she left the next year.

‘There is 
no question in my mind that if Sally Ride had been openly gay and if she
 had applied to NASA, number one, she never would have been selected as 
an astronaut,' writes Sherr.
