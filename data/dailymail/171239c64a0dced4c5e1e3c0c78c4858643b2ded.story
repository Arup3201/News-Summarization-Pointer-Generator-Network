The footage of the wasps at work was uploaded by YouTube user Vang Tsal in the attic of his house. 

Thankfully, the nest is being made against a double-paned window that can't be opened.

This follows news this week that conservationists and pest controllers alike have noticed a remarkable lack of wasps this summer.

It is unclear precisely why the insects are having such a bad year - but all are agreed it is something to do with the changeable weather the UK has seen over the past few years.
