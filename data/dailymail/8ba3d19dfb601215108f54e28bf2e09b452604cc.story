A US Airways passenger jet travelling between Brussels and Philadelphia was forced to turn back after developing a technical fault over Ireland. 

Flight US751 was passing Shannon in the West of Ireland when the captain decided to abandon his trans-Atlantic crossing after the Boeing 757-200 developed a fault.

Unfortunately for the passengers and crew on board the Boeing 757 is unable to dump fuel so the captain was forced to enter a holding pattern west of Brussels for several hours.

The Boeing 757-200 was unable to dump fuel and was forced to return to Brussels and circle for several hours while it came down its maximum landing weight and arrived safely after more than six hours in the air

The aircraft took off from Brussels en-route to Philadelphia but was forced to turn around as it passed the west coast of Ireland after developing a fault and circled for several hours near Ghent before landing safely 

The jet landed safely after 16.30 after spending more than six hours in the air. 

It is understood the captain was forced to circle Brussels as he was over his maximum landing weight and needed to reduce the amount of fuel on board.  

The narrow bodied aircraft has a capacity to carry a maximum of 204 seats, with 18 people in business class and 186 in economy.

The aircraft was almost 90 minutes into its flight when it developed the fault and returned to its original departure point. It is understood the aircraft descended to 19,000ft and and slowed to 380kts while it waited to land. 

A spokesperson for the Irish Aviation Authority said: 'Our Air Traffic Controllers at Shannon were notified about a problem with the aircraft and we facilitated its turnaround.' 

It is understood that the aircraft developed a problem with its rudder.

Emergency services in Brussels were put on standby as a precaution as the aircraft came into land.  

US Airways did not respond at the time of publication.
