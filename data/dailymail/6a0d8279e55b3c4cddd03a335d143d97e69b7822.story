Neil Robert Edwards, 24, has been banned from driving for 12 weeks and fined £300 after he was caught doing 131.5mph in a Corsa

An electrician caught doing 131mph in a Vauxhall Corsa while on his way to a garage specialising in engine modifications has been banned from driving for 12 weeks.

Neil Robert Edwards, 24, from Mynydd Isa near Mold, in Wales, was spotted by police hurtling along the A55  at nearly twice the 70mph speed limit despite the wet conditions.

When officers stopped Edwards to ask him where he was going, he told them he was rushing to 'Demon Tweeks', a garage which sells parts to tune up car engines.

Realising what he had done, Edwards then asked officers: 'Is there nothing we can do about this?' 

He was today banned from driving for 12 weeks at Flintshire Magistrates’ Court as well as being fined £300 plus £115 in costs.

A standard model Vauxhall Corsa comes with a 1.2 litre engine and is capable of a top speed of 107mph. 

Prosecutor Gareth Jones told the court that when Edwards was caught on February 15 the road was wet but it had stopped raining.

He said that such cases were sometimes charged as dangerous driving because of the excessive speed but the defendant had been charged simply with speeding as the roads had been so empty at the time.

Phillip Lloyd Jones, defending, said that there was no excuse for driving at such a speed, adding that his client understood that the 70mph speed limit should be adhered to.

The defendant was going to a shop and was late, he bitterly regretted his actions and fully co-operated when stopped, Mr Jones added.

Mr Jones said that the consequences could be very serious for his client as he travels the country as an electrician doing maintenance work.

He said that the company had already placed a black mark against Edwards' name, adding that he could be fired depending on the length of the ban.

Despite that, Edwards had a reference from his employers, who clearly thought highly of him.  

Edwards said he had been given good advice by his family about the dangers of speeding and would not behave like that again.

Flintshire Magistrates' Court (pictured) heard that, after being stopped by officers, Edwards said he was going to a garage that sells parts to modify car engines, before asking police: 'Is there nothing we can do about this?'
