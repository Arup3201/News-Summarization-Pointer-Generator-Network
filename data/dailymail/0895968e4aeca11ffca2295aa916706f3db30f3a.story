Max Clifford (pictured speaking to media yesterday outside his home in Surrey) has been charged with 11 counts of indecent assault

PR guru Max Clifford last night vowed to clear his name after being charged with a string of indecent assaults against teenage girls.

The 70-year-old publicist will face trial over 11 claims of sexual abuse against seven girls and young women, aged between 14 and 19. Within minutes of the charges being revealed, he appeared on television to deny the accusations.

He was arrested in December in connection with Operation Yewtree, the police inquiry set up after Jimmy Savile was exposed as a predatory paedophile with more than 450 victims. Clifford said the allegations were ‘completely false’ and vowed to ‘clear my name in a court of law’.

He was charged after he answered police bail and will appear at Westminster Magistrates’ Court on May 28. The charges span a 19-year period between 1966 and 1985.

The Crown Prosecution Service found there was insufficient evidence to bring charges in relation to three other allegations.

Clifford said he was ‘living a 24/7 nightmare’.

He added: ‘The allegations in respect of which I have been charged are completely false and I have made this clear to the police during many, many hours of interviews.

‘Nevertheless a decision has been taken to charge me with 11 offences involving seven women, the most recent of which is 28 years ago and the oldest 47 years ago. I have never indecently assaulted anyone in my life and this will become clear during the course of the proceedings.

‘I am naturally disappointed. However, at least I will now be in a position to fully consider all the evidence against me and to answer the evidence in public and ultimately clear my name in a court of law.

‘Since last December I have been living a 24/7 nightmare. A black cloud has been placed over me, obliterating the bright blue skies that I have been fortunate to live my life under for the vast majority of the past 70 years.

‘Fortunately I have and continue to receive wonderful support and understanding from those who knew me, those who know me, as well as people I meet everywhere I go.’ 

Police have arrested a string of celebrities as part of Operation Yewtree, including convicted paedophile Gary Glitter, comics Freddie Starr and Jim Davidson, presenter Rolf Harris and DJ Dave Lee Travis. All deny any wrongdoing.

There are three strands to the Yewtree investigation – two involving Savile, and a third termed ‘Others’. Clifford falls into this third category, meaning he was not being questioned about anything connected to Savile.

Clifford has been a vocal commentator on the Savile scandal, and before his arrest he said a lot of ageing stars were worried about being dragged into the investigation.

He said at least 15 big name stars from the 1960s and 70s had contacted him because they had lived a hedonistic lifestyle where young girls threw themselves at them, but they ‘never asked for anybody’s birth certificate’.

‘It is a situation which could easily
turn into a witch-hunt,’ he said. ‘Where is it going to end? I hope 
they (the police) concentrate on finding people like Jimmy Savile who 
were manipulating girls.’

Clifford
represented the rich and famous for 40 years, his website boasts, and 
he is considered to be almost as famous as those he represents.

His first wife, Liz, died of cancer in 2003 and he married his former PA Jo Westwood in 2010. He has a daughter, Louise, 41.

Alison
Saunders, chief crown prosecutor for CPS London, said: ‘We have 
concluded that there is sufficient evidence  and it is in the public 
interest for Mr Clifford to be charged with 11 offences of indecent 
assault relating to seven complainants.’

Speaking outside his home today, 
Clifford said: 'The allegations in respect of which I have been charged 
are completely false, very upsetting, very distressing, but completely 
false.

'I have made it clear to the police 
during probably around 25 hours of interviews since last December when I
was initially arrested, that there's absolutely no truth and substance 
in any of these allegations.'

He added: 'I'm so grateful to the 
many people that I meet everywhere I go who have been so supportive to 
me and since this charge being announced in the last couple of hours 
I've literally had hundreds of calls to my office, to friends, to 
myself, to my wife, to family members, and everyone of them has been 
nothing but supportive.

'Twenty-eight years ago was this most recent (allegation), and 47 years ago was the oldest.

'That's what I'm up against and that's what I've now got to - with my legal team - face up to and sort out to clear my name.'
