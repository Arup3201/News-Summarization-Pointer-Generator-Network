There was a moment, less than a minute into Jose Mourinho's appearance after Chelsea's victory over Everton, when the threat was real and the mood was menacing.

'One more question I leave, so I'm more concerned with my reaction, so one more question and I will have to go,' claimed Chelsea's manager. Mourinho was back in 'Campaign Mode', driving the Chelsea battle bus towards another ridge in the road. He left us with another cliffhanger.

Because this is Chelsea, because this is Mourinho, the repercussions and the recriminations will last for days. How sad that is.

Jose Mourinho refused to discuss the melee towards the end of Chelsea's win over Everton

The Chelsea boss threatened to walk out of his press conference if he was asked another question

The incident took place during a melee shortly before Chelsea scored the winner through Willian

Mourinho had just been asked about the moment in the 88th minute when Gareth Barry's dopey challenge on Willian caused an almighty rumpus in front of the two technical areas.

In real-time Mourinho jumped out of his seat, followed wearily and predictably by the concertinaed figures of coaches Rui Faria, Steve Holland, Christophe Lollichom and Silvino Louro. Ramires was waving an imaginary card at referee Jonathan Moss, for which he was booked, and Chelsea's bench were demanding the return of capital punishment down there. 

Scenes like that make you want to cough up blood. What followed was the ugly side of the game, with players from Chelsea and Everton puffing out their chests and pretending they are all hard as nails. For the FA the focus on Thursday morning will be on Branislav Ivanovic, the Chelsea defender who was accused on social media of biting Everton substitute James McCarthy. The video is inconclusive.

The resulting free-kick led to the decisive goal and Ivanovic was involved. His header was punched out unconvincingly by Tim Howard to Willian, who struck the winner.

Ivanovic is likely to be charged with violent conduct for shoving his head into the side of McCarthy's left ear before Chelsea's captain John Terry and Didier Drogba could eventually drag the doofus away. Lovely player and all that, but even the great players lose it from time to time.

And when Mourinho was asked about the apparent headbutt, he threatened to walk out.

The Portuguese, last month fined £25,000 for saying there was a 'clear campaign' against Chelsea, was not prepared to discuss the possibility the Serbia defender could be banned.

He had earlier told BT Sport: 'Did Branislav Ivanovic go in with his head? Don't make me laugh. Don't make me laugh.'

And in an interview with the BBC, when asked if he would punish a player if replays showed he had committed an offence, the Portuguese ended the interview, saying: 'Sorry. See you tomorrow.'

Everton boss Roberto Martinez felt the Serbian should have been dismissed.

The Spaniard said: 'Ivanovic's behaviour is wrong.

'He grabs James McCarthy around his neck in a very forceful manner, then he puts his head against him when James McCarthy never reacted one single bit.

'If you want to be on top of the laws that's a red card.' 

Mourinho has already shown his displeasure at Diego Costa being suspended retrospectively for three matches for stamping on Liverpool's Emre Can.

The Blues boss, who could be fined by the Premier League for opting out of media duties surrounding last month's draw with Manchester City, continues to imply his side are unfairly treated.

Two decisions went in favour of Everton in the opening quarter of the contest, when the ball hit Steven Naismith's arm in the penalty area in the fourth minute and when Barry made two fouls in quick succession, but was booked only for the first offence.

Mourinho added: 'I'm tired of stories and I'm never tired of football. Football is emotion and what we had here.

'A discussion because of a red card, a red card that should be given in the first half, because Barry should be sent off in the first half.

'He pulled Hazard. The second yellow card should be given there.'

Mourinho had no complaints with referee Moss' performance.

'I think it's a clear penalty. I also think the referee had a fantastic performance,' the Blues boss added.

'The official that disallowed the goal, it was a fantastic decision.'

Barry was eventually sent off in the second half for his part in the melee 

REPORTER: The mass confrontation between the players at the end...

MOURINHO: You know, I'm tired of stories. I'm never tired of football and football is emotion and football is what we had here today.

A discussion because of a red card that should be given in the first half because [Gareth] Barry should be sent off in the first half because he had a yellow card. He pulled Hazard when Hazard goes to attack a defender so second yellow card should be shown there.

So nothing, nothing important.

REPORTER: How concerned are you that Branislav Ivanovic might face retrospective action?

MOURINHO: I'm concerned about my reaction because one more question I leave and after that you're not happy.

I'm more concerned with my reaction because the next question for that story, I have to go.

REPORTER: Do you think you should have had a penalty?

MOURINHO: I think it is a clear penalty but i think the referee had a fantastic performance.

[It is] a very difficult performance when the game is one team defending, recovering the ball and playing it to [Romelu] Lukaku. This for a referee must be a nightmare.

He has to be focused on one box then suddenly a long ball and the ball is faster than the referee.

So I think [it was a] very difficult match for him but very stable performance. And the official that disallowed the goal was a fantastic decision.
