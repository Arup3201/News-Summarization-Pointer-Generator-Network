With its boarded-up windows and faded whitewash walls, walkers could be forgiven for ignoring this decaying concrete building tucked away in the Welsh hills.

But Criggion station, not far from Welshpool, Powys, was once the heartbeat of Britain's naval communications and played a vital role in many key military decisions.

The centre was built during the Second World War amid fears the Germans could bomb the UK's main communications post at Rugby, Warwickshire.

Criggion Station near Welshpool, Powys was once the centre of British naval communications, beaming messages out to submarines and battleships around the world

After it was abandoned at the end of the 1990s, the once-important building has since been left to rot and photos show the current state of its once-bustling halls

While Criggion was still being tested, a fire knocked out the centre at Rugby, making the Welsh station Britain's foremost naval communications post, sending out orders to our huge fleet of submarines and battleships.

The station was used in ordering the sinking of German battleship Scharnhorst in 1943, seen as huge psychological blow for the German high command and the nation as a whole.

But it was after the Second World War that the station was at its busiest. It became the top-secret hub of Cold War communications and 160 people worked at the site during the tense 1960s, as messages were beamed across the Atlantic during the Cuban Missile Crisis.

As the centre of communications with missile-launching submarines, it was feared the site would be one of the first Russian targets in the event of nuclear war and it soon saw protests by nuclear disarmament campaigners and activists.

The centre
 remained key to Britain's naval communication right up until the end of
 the 1990s, but its three 700ft-high radio masts and three 600ft-high 
towers were demolished in 2003.

Eerie new pictures of the abandoned building have emerged ahead of plans to turn it into a war museum.

In its heyday in the 1960s, the centre was the hub of communications with Britain's nuclear submarines and was believed to be a key target in the case of a Russian missile strike

Locals now want to turn the building into a war museum, celebrating the centre's importance in many of Britain's 20th century conflicts

The building is nearby 'Rodney's Pillar', a 1782 monument dedicated to naval hero Vice-Admiral Sir George Bryden Rodney to commemorate the defeat of a French fleet in the West Indies

Local councillor Graham Brown, who is leading a campaign to revamp the decaying centre, said: 'You would not believe what went on in these buildings that were linked up to Hawaii and Colorado in the USA.

'It is believed Margaret Thatcherâ€™s direct order to sink the Argentine ship the General Belgrano during the Falklands War was transmitted through Criggion.

'The buildings have been left to decay over the past decade but we want to turn them into a museum exhibition which could have both historical and educational value.'

The area's naval traditions go back to the building of 'Rodney's Pillar' on Breidden, a mound created by underground volcanic activity.

The 1782 monument which tops the hill is dedicated to naval hero Vice-Admiral Sir George Bryden Rodney, to commemorate the defeat of a French fleet in the West Indies.

Four bidders are believed to have come forward to Criggion's current owners Telereal Trillium and the potential sale is expected to be completed by the end of June.

Orders to sink the Scharnhorst (pictured left), a key German warship, during the Second World War, were sent from the station. The centre was at it busiest around the time of the Cuban Missile Crisis, as US President John F Kennedy (pictured right) prepared for potential nuclear war on the other side of the Atlantic

The centre is believed to have been used to route orders from Prime Minister Margaret Thatcher to sink the Argentinian cruiser General Belgrano in 1982
