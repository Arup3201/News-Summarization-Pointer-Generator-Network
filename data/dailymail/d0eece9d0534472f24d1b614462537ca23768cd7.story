An increasing number of English homes now come with their very own vineyards as domestic wine production soars. 

As domestic wines have grown in 
popularity, a number of vine-covered properties have come on the market 
 - with wine-lovers no longer needing to look across the Channel for 
their dream home.

The UK currently has 448 commercial vineyards as well as a futher 89 hobby vineyards, and the amount of space given over to the vines has almost doubled from 761 hectares in 2004 to 1,520 today.

One property boasting its own vineyard is a five-bedroom house in the West Sussex village of Kingscote, near East Grinstead, which is on sale for £1.6million.

It is set within five acres of land and includes a working vineyard - although potential buyers do not have to be wine experts to enjoy the fruit of the land.

A description of the property by Robert Leech estate agents reads: 'A five bar gate leads to a private vineyard, where there is a variety of grape including Bacchus.

'There is an option for this area to be managed by the adjacent Kingscote Vineyards, wine makers, who can produce English wine on behalf of the owners, if required.'

The farm boasts a six-bedroom family home, three two-bedroom cottages, an indoor swimming pool, a hard tennis court and stables.

It also has multiple acres of productive vines, according to the Country House Company brochure.

'The Hobby vines are to either side of the house and consist of about four acres of 25 year old vines producing an average of more than 1,000 bottles of white wine annually,' the document adds.

Location, location, location: This five-bedroom home in Piltdown, East Sussex, is on sale for £1.17million

There are currently 448 commercial vineyards in England and Wales, as well as 89 'hobby' vineyards where the wine produced is not sold or recorded.

The total area of land given over to vineyards is 1,520 hectares, compared with 761 in 2004, according to the Food Standards Agency.

Most of the UK's vineyards are located in South East England - with approximately 880 hectares spread across Hampshire, the Isle of Wight, Surrey, Kent and Sussex.

There are a further 202 hectares across Cornwall, Devon, Somerset, Wiltshire and Gloucestershire, as well as other vineyards in East Anglia, the 
Midlands and a few further north and in Wales.

The largest single vineyard is Denbies Wine Estate in Dorking, Surrey which produces around 300,000 litres of wine per year from its 265 acres.

The main vine varieties grown are now dominated by the classic 
sparkling wine varieties Chardonnay and Pinot Noir, whose combined area 
has increased by 177 per cent since 2008.

There has also been a steady 
increase of Pinot Meunier, but the longer established white varieties 
Bacchus, Seyval Blanc, Reichensteiner and Muller-Thurgau now account for 
slightly less than 25per cent of the total.

Production volumes vary quite widely from year to year depending on 
weather conditions, and 2012 had the lowest volume since 1997.

The highest 
recorded harvest was in 2010 at 30,346 hectolitres, with previous large 
harvests occurring in 2006, 1996 and 1992.
