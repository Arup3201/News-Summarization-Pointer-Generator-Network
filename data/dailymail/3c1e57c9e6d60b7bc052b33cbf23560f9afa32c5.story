The widening gap between rich and poor has held back the US economy over two decades, a new report warns today.

Since 1990, rising inequality knocked almost 7 percentage points off growth in the US, the Organisation for Economic Co-operation and Development (OECD) said.

The global think tank said taxes on the rich did not damage the economy, and could be used to help families with children to improve their lives.

Economic growth in most major countries would have been much higher without the impact of inequality between the rich and poor, according to the OECD

Countries where income inequality is falling grow faster than those with rising inequality, the body's latest report states.

'The gap between rich and poor is now at its highest level in 30 years in most OECD countries, it said.

As a result, income inequality has curbed economic growth 'significantly'.

The overall increase in income inequality has been driven by the very rich 1 per cent of earners dramatically increasing their wealth, pulling away from the rest of society.

But the biggest challenge to growth has been families on lower incomes 'slipping behind'.

The OECD said: 'This negative effect of inequality on growth is determined not just by the poorest income decile but actually by the bottom 40% of income earners.'

In part this is because people from poorer backgrounds are less likely to invest in and improve their education, making it harder for them to increase their earning potential.

The report studied how changes in inequality between 1985 and 2005 affected subsequent economic growth between 1990 and 2010.

It found that an increasing gap between the haves and have nots has knocked almost 7 percentage points off gross domestic product (GDP) in the US.

It is estimated to have reduced growth by 10 points in Mexico and New Zealand, almost 9 points in the UK and between six and seven Italy and Sweden in the two decades pre-recession.

The report could put pressure on Barack Obama to do more to target the wealthy in the tax system to support those on lower incomes

The OECD called for tax rises to be used to redistributed wealth from the richest to the poorest, insisting it would not harm growth, 'provided these policies are well designed and implemented'.

OECD secretary general Angel Gurria said: 'This compelling evidence proves that addressing high and growing inequality is critical to promote strong and sustained growth and needs to be at the centre of the policy debate.

'Countries that promote equal opportunity for all from an early age are those that will grow and prosper.'

It is the gap between the bottom 40 per cent and the rest of society, not just the poorest 10 per cent, that contributes to the effects of inequality on a country's growth, the paper said.

The report is part of the think-tank's efforts to find the root causes and see what lessons can be learned from the global financial crisis.

Anti-poverty programmes are not enough to tackle the problem, the OECD warned, claiming 'education is the key'.

The paper claims to have discovered new evidence that the main way inequality affects growth is by undermining education opportunities for children from poor socio-economic backgrounds, lowering social mobility and hampering skills development.

While the children of parents who have had low levels of education see their educational outcomes deteriorate as income inequality rises, there is little or no effect on people whose parents have had a middle or high level of education, it said.

The paper states that investment is needed in high-quality education, training and healthcare in order to create greater equality of opportunities, and it claims redistributing taxes and benefits does not harm a country's economic growth so long as the policies are 'well-designed, targeted and implemented'.
