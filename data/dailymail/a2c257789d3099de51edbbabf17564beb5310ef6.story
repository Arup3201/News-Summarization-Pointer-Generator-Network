A robot astronaut called Kirobo has made world history by becoming the first robot ever to speak in space.

The 13-inch tall Japanese humanoid has been aboard the International Space Station since 10 August and made the broadcast via video link.

It said: 'On August 21, 2013, a robot took one small step towards a brighter future for all. Good morning to everyone on Earth. This is Kirobo. I am the world's first talking robot astronaut. Nice to meet you.'

The 13-inch tall Japanese robot, designed by Toyota, has been on board the International Space Station since 10 August and made the historical broadcast to its Earth counterpart Mirata via video link

Kirobo was first unveiled at a press conference in Tokyo in June.

It was created by Tomotaka Takahashi in collaboration with the Research Center for 
Advanced Science and Technology, the University of Tokyo, Robo Garage 
and Toyota.

During the conference, project manager, Yorichika Nishijima said: 'Russia was the first to go outer space,
 the U.S. was the first to go to the moon, we want Japan to be the first
 to send a robot-astronaut to space that can communicate with humans.' 

Kirobo was launched into space on board the H-IIB Launch Vehicle No. 4 from Japan's Tanegashima Space Centre on 4 August.

It
 spent six days in orbit before crew aboard the International Space 
Station (ISS) used a robotic arm to remove it from the launch capsule.

Kirobo continued that a backup crew member called Mirata was providing support on Earth before adding: 'Mirata, please stand by, I will now send a photo to Earth.'

Mirata is a similar make and model counterpart robot for Kirobo, based at Tokyo's Research Centre for Advanced Science and Technology.

Kirobo is 34 centimetres tall (13 inches) and weighs about 1kg (2.2lbs).

It was first unveiled at a press conference in June.

Project manager, Yorichika Nishijima said: 'Russia was the first to go outer space,
 the U.S. was the first to go to the moon, we want Japan to be the first
 to send a robot-astronaut to space that can communicate with humans.'

The humanoid robot was created by Tomotaka Takahashi.

It is a collaboration 
between advertising and PR company Dentsu, the Research Center for 
Advanced Science and Technology, the University of Tokyo, Robo Garage 
and Toyota Motor Corporation.

I want to come home! Kirobo the robot is stranded aboard the International space Station indefinitely

Kirobo will keep records of conversations with Wakata as well as be used on missions to relay messages from the control room to the commander

Toyota also provided the 
robot’s voice recognition software and plans to use the Kirobo project to develop other robots with improved interactive conversation technology.

Kirobo was launched into space on board the H-IIB Launch Vehicle No. 4 from Japan's Tanegashima Space Centre on 4 August.

It spent six days in orbit before crew aboard the International Space Station (ISS) used a robotic arm to remove it from the launch capsule.

Before the end of the year, astronaut Koichi Wakata is due to become the first Japanese commander of the space station.

Kirobo has been programmed to recognise Wakata's face and will be able to identify him when the astronaut begins his expedition.

It will then keep records of conversations with Wakata as well as be used on missions to relay messages from the control room to the commander.

Mirata will act as a go-between and can also check for problems in the machine's electronic components.

Takahashi said: 'By bringing a robot into space, the development of a symbiotic robot is
 expected to move along much faster.'
