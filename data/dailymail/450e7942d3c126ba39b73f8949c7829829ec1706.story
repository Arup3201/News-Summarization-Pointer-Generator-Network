Fancy tickets to the fight in Las Vegas that took five years to confirm? Think again.

Tickets for the $250million (£160m) bout between Floyd Mayweather and Manny Pacquiao at the MGM Grand on May 2 are already being flogged for as much as $26,500 (£17,200) on ticketnetwork.com.

Mayweather officially announced the mega-fight with Pacquiao by sharing a photograph of the contract on his social media account on Friday, confirming the fight all punters want to see.

Yet those hoping to witness the blockbuster will have to spend big. While ringside seats are being priced at £17,200, the same website's cheapest ticket was £5,060 (£3,300). 

While those flogging the tickets will get a handsome payday, it will hardly compare to that of Mayweather and Pacquaio. 

Mayweather is understood to have commanded a 60-40 split of the purse, meaning he will rake in a minimum $150m (£96m) and Pacquaio at least $100m (£64m). 

The 37-year-old is believed to have been the dominant figure throughout negotiations – right up to getting his wish to announce the fight via Shots.com - a social media site  he has a stake in.

He posted the contract along with the caption: 'What the world has been waiting for has arrived. Mayweather vs. Pacquiao on May 2, 2015, is a done deal. I promised the fans we would get this done, and we did. We will make history on May 2nd. Don't miss it! This is the signed contract from both fighters.'

Meanwhile, the pay-per-view price has not been set but could reach $100 (£65), according to the LA Times.
