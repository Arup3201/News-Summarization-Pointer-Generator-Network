A million time-poor workers are preparing to call in sick this festive season so they can get their Christmas shopping all wrapped up.

With the big day fast approaching, one in seven Britons would not be against pretending to be ill in order to be able to shop for presents, a survey found.

Of those pulling a 'sickie', one in three were keen to avoid the long queues and crowds of December weekends in favour of quieter weekday outings.

But many workers planning to feign illness to get a day off won't even be leaving the house, the survey found.

Just over a third will be waiting at home for a delivery to arrive, according to the study by Vouchercodes.co.uk.

The same amount admitted they would not get their Christmas shopping finished in time if they left it to the weekends, a report in the Daily Star newspaper said.

Some employees may have to take an extra sick day, as the survey showed a fifth of Britons have not even started buying presents yet.
