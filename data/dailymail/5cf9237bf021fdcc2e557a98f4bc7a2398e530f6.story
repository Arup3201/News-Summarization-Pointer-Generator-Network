Move: Burberry chief executive Angela Ahrendts is set to leave the company to become senior vice president of Apple

Burberry's chief executive announced she was quitting yesterday, reducing the number of women in charge of FTSE 100 firms to just two.

Angela Ahrendts revealed she plans to leave the British firm next year to move to the technology giant Apple.

Her shock departure wiped nearly £536million off Burberry’s value.

Mrs Ahrendts, 53, has transformed the brand over her  tenure, and is credited with  ‘de-chavving’ its image after its famous check became popular with minor celebrities and football fans.

The company, which has been transformed into a global luxury brand with a growing presence in emerging markets, today revealed 17 per cent growth in underlying retail sales in the six months to the end of September.

The share prices later recovered some of their losses in early trading to be 
down 3.8 per cent at 1,524 pence at about 8am.

Ms Ahrendts, 53, joined Burberry in January 2006, and became chief executive six months later.

The company, whose models currently include Cara Delevingne and David and Victoria Beckham’s son Romeo, has been one of the best performers in the FTSE 100 under her leadership.

The mother-of-three, a committed Christian who reads the Bible every day, has spent the last two decades working her way up in the fashion industry after gaining a merchandising and marketing degree from Ball State University.

She cut her teeth at less glamorous places like bra maker Warnaco and working-girl staple Liz Claiborne, where she spent eight years before moving to Britain.

Last year, the American was the highest paid chief executive of any FTSE 100 company, the first woman to top that elite league table, with a total pay package of £16.9million.

Transition: Burberry's chief creative officer Christopher Bailey (right) will take over as chief executive as Ms Ahrendts (left) leaves the company to join Apple

Burberry Group has said its chief creative officer Christopher Bailey will become its new chief executive.

The
firm today said Ms Ahrendts would step down by mid-2014 after which 
Bailey would be appointed to the role of Chief Creative and Chief 
Executive Officer.

Bailey has been at Burberry since 2001 and has held the major creative role for six years.

Ahrendts
will join Apple to take up a newly created position as a senior vice 
president with oversight of Apple retail and online stores. She will 
report directly to CEO Tim Cook.

Burberry chairman Sir John Peace said: 
'I want to thank Angela personally for building a great culture and 
leading the company through the incredible transformation over the last 
eight years.'

Sir John described the CEO transition as 'a natural progression'.

He said: 'I have no doubt that Christopher’s vision and leadership, with the excellent management team in place, will keep Burberry on the forefront creatively, digitally and financially, creating further value for shareholders in the next exciting stage of our evolution.'

Ms Ahrendts said: 'It has been an honour to have partnered with Sir John Peace and Christopher for the last eight years.

'I am confident that, with Sir John’s 
continued guidance and the executive team’s support, Christopher, as one
of this generation’s greatest visionaries, will continue to lead 
Burberry to new heights.

'Today, Burberry is not only a great brand, but a
truly great company.'

American Angela Ahrendts spent 20 years working her way up to the top in the fashion industry after gaining a merchandising and marketing degree from Ball State University.

The 53-year-old did her time at less glamorous places like bra maker Warnaco and working-girl staple Liz Claiborne, where she spent eight years before moving to Britain.

At one point she was working 80 hours a week. She joined Burberry in January 2006 and became its chief executive in July that same year.

She is credited with ‘de-chavving’ Burberry, after its famous check had become popular with minor celebrities and football fans and was being widely counterfeited. It has subsequently been removed from the vast majority of the firm’s products.

Last year, she was the highest 
paid chief executive of any FTSE 100 company, the first woman to top 
that elite league table, with a total pay package of £16.9million.

While her basic salary was £1million, 
the largest chunk came from selling £11.9million of her shares in the 
firm, built up over several years. Her pay has dropped to £3.3million, 
including a basic salary of £1million and a bonus of £1.5million, 
according to the company’s annual report.

Mr Bailey said: 'I am profoundly moved 
and humbled to be asked to take on the CEO role at this company that 
means so much to me.

'I also feel privileged to be keeping my role as Chief Creative Officer, as I believe that creativity and innovation have been at the heart of our success in the last ten years and will be even more so in the decade ahead.

'We have a clear strategy to build on, an increasingly powerful brand and an inspiring management team.

'Together, we will continue to push the boundaries of design, technology and communication while never forgetting our heritage, our Britishness and our values.

'It has been my privilege to work with people right across the company over the last ten years, and whilst I am sad no longer to have the inspirational leadership of Angela, who has been an absolute joy to work with, I feel more than confident that part of her legacy is an enormously strong team in all of our areas.'

Burberry also today announced its retail revenue rose 17 per cent to £694 million pounds in the six months to September, compared to £577 million in the same period last year - a first quarter rise of 18 percent.

Retail sales from stores open at least a year grew by 13 per cent, helped by double digit growth in Asia Pacific and the Europe, Middle East, India and Africa (EMEIA) division region and high single digit growth in the Americas.

Total revenue was £1.03 billion, up 14 per cent.

Shares in Burberry, up 41 per cent over the last year, closed Monday at 1,585 pence, valuing the business at £7billion.
