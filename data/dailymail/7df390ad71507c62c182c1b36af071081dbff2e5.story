Babies are ten times more likely to develop autism if they have a brother or sister with the condition, according to the biggest-ever study of its kind. 

It found that a child’s risk of being diagnosed with the developmental  disorder also doubles if they have a cousin with the condition.

The study of two million children came after scientists at King’s College London were asked by  numerous parents what their chances were of having a second autistic child.

Discovery: Babies are ten times more likely to develop autism if they have a brother or sister with the condition, according to a new study. The risk of being diagnosed also doubles if they have a cousin with the disorder

The study looked at the medical records of all children born in Sweden between 1982 and 2006, to see how those with autism were related.

Of the two million children, 14,516 were diagnosed with an ‘autism spectrum disorder’.

Those on the spectrum find it  difficult to socialise with other children, and struggle to read the subtle signs in people’s speech, faces and body language. 

However, there is a wide range in how badly sufferers are affected and how they respond.

Some withdraw into their own worlds, rarely smiling, while others react with aggression or obsessively follow repetitive routines. 

Many need substantial support into their adult lives, with some parents left struggling to cope.

Study author Dr Sven Sandin, of King’s College London and the Karolinska Institute in Stockholm, said parents with an autistic child needed to think carefully about enlarging their family. 

‘Some will want to avoid having another autistic child, but for others it won’t be a problem,’ he added.

But Dr Laura Cockburn, of the National Autistic Society, said parents of autistic children were ‘well aware of the significant challenges involved in raising them’.

She said: ‘Parents can only make a decision about having another child based on what’s best for their family.’

She also noted that many of those who develop the condition are born into families with no history of it.

Autism is much more common in boys than girls; overall, the chance of having a boy on the autistic spectrum is about one in 50. 

This increases to one in five if the boy is born to a couple who already has an autistic child.

Accountable: 'Environmental factors' - such as premature birth - account for 50 per cent of a child's chance of being autistic, says the study. But most of these factors appear to be outside the control of parents (file picture)

By contrast, the chance of a girl having autism is lower, at about one in 200. Consequently, the chance of a baby girl developing the condition if she also has a sibling with it is one  in 20.

The study, published in the Journal of the American Medical Association, also found genes account for 50 per cent of a child’s chance of being autistic, with ‘environmental factors’ accounting for the remaining 50 per cent.

Previous studies of twins have suggested genes play an even higher role – as high as 90 per cent.

But Dr Sandin said most of these environmental factors – such as  premature birth – appeared to be outside the control of parents.
