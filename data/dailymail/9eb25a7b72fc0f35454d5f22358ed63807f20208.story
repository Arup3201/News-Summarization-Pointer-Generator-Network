A businessman died in a  scuba diving accident hours after his wife telephoned him to say she was pregnant.

Lex Warner’s wife Deborah lost their unborn baby weeks later and is now bringing up their first child, two-year-old Vincent, alone.

Mr Warner, 50, had fallen on board a chartered boat before a dive off the north coast of Scotland, suffering a severe injury to his liver.

Despite the fall diving instructors gave him the all clear to continue and he jumped into the water, diving to almost 290ft.

But
 he experienced serious difficulties and although Andrew Cuthbertson,  
skipper of the Jean Elaine, hauled him to the surface, Mr Warner was 
pronounced dead soon afterwards.

Mrs
 Warner, 42, who had been married  for 18 years, said: ‘I found out I 
was ten weeks pregnant while Lex was on the boat, so called to tell him 
and he was delighted. He told me a dive planned that morning had been 
cancelled because of bad weather conditions.

‘He was still upbeat but was also excited about coming home. That was the last time I spoke to him.’

Mrs
 Warner, from Sutton Coldfield, Birmingham, still works for the building
 firm she ran with her husband who had gone diving with Scapa Flow 
Charters.

She claims she was
 told after his death in August 2012 that he had drowned and his fall 
wasn’t mentioned. ‘It was only when I went to Scotland for the 
post-mortem that I found out he had sustained injuries not consistent 
with diving. There have been two other deaths of divers using these 
boats since 2007.’

Mrs 
Warner, herself an experienced scuba diver, said she believes the 
organisers of the dive did not carry out the appropriate checks after 
her husband fell.

Tragedy: Mr Warner died on August 14, 2012, and Debbie sadly lost their unborn child six weeks later

Keen diver: Lex Warner suffered serious internal injuries in a fall then drowned

She has 
condemned the company for failing to stop her husband from diving and 
for not carrying out thorough enough checks into his health.

‘I
 am taking legal advice with a view to pursuing a claim through the 
civil courts,’ Mrs Warner said. ‘I do not believe justice has been 
served for Lex and I want to avoid this kind of avoidable tragedy 
happening again.

‘Lex was very serious about his diving. He would never have jeopardised his safety.’

All-clear: Mr Warner suffered internal injuries but was given all-clear to dive by skipper Andrew Cuthbertson

At
 a Birmingham inquest, in December, Captain Gavin Pritchard, an 
inspector for the Marine Accident Investigation Branch, said Mr Warner’s
 diving group had not been warned of the dangers of walking on deck in 
full diving gear.

Truth: Mrs Warner said she was pleased 'the truth has been told' at the inquest, but says she has still not come to terms with the tragedy

He added: 
‘There was no evidence of a formal risk assessment of a fully-dressed 
diver moving from the seated position to the point of entry into the 
water. It was our recommendation to conduct a thorough review of the 
safety arrangements to minimise risk to divers as they prepare to enter 
the water.

‘The severity of 
the injuries was such that if he had not dived, his condition would have
 still reached serious medical emergency level.’

Mr
 Cuthbertson told the inquest he was satisfied with the safety 
arrangements on his boats and had no plans to alter them. ‘I don’t think
 we could have done anything differently,’ he said. ‘I can’t foresee 
someone’s going to fall.’

Dr
 Chris Ashton, who performed the post-mortem examination, gave the cause
 of death as drowning combined with a traumatic hepatic (liver) injury. 
Coroner Louise Hunt recorded a verdict of accidental death.

Scapa Flow Charters were yesterday unavailable to comment on Mrs Warner’s criticisms.
