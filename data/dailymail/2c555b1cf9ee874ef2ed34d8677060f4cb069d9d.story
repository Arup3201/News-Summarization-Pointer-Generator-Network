News Corp chief executive Rupert Murdoch saw Tony Abbott's proposed $5.5 billion paid parental leave scheme before his fellow Coalition members.

A month before the plan was announced in 2010 without the consultation of his party colleagues, the Prime Minister sought out the advice of Mr Murdoch on the controversial policy.

The consultation took place at a dinner while Mr Murdoch was in Australia and allowed the magnate to drum up support among his Australian-based editors.

The book claims Mr Murdoch considered paid parental leave to be a 'visionary' plan which would even help his own employees at his Australian-based operations, reported The Australian Financial Review.

The meeting happened over dinner while the U.S. based mogul was in Australia, according to Treasurer Joe Hockey (right) in the biography, 'Hockey: Not Your Average Joe'

Details of the private meeting are revealed in a biography of Treasurer Joe Hockey 'Hockey: Not Your Average Joe'.

Mr Hockey claims in the book that Mr Abbott only mentioned the scheme to him as 'a brief add-on in a telephone conversation, with no specific date or details attached', before it was announced.

'They were encouraged to support it (Murdoch's editors), notwithstanding that it represented a tax impost and was skewed to be of most benefit to parents outside their middle-Australian readership,' he says in the book.

'This fact was unknown to members in the party room, who condemned Abbott’s solo policymaking on such a fundamental issue.'

Despite Mr Hockey's claims he was not given specific details of the scheme, the book's author Madonna King writes that the Prime Minister recalled a far more thorough conversation between himself and Mr Hockey

'Joe was one of the very few colleagues whom I discussed the paid parental leave proposal with ... I don’t want to verbal Joe but he certainly saw the merit in it – that's not quite the same as saying he enthusiastically supported it,' Mr Abbott is quoted in the book as saying.

Tony Abbott is believed to have proposed his $5.5 billion paid maternity leave scheme in a bid to improve his image among female voters. The plan has proved controversial with his party because of a proposed tax on big business to pay for it

However, Mr Abbott's decision to announce the plan resulted in a showdown with Mr Hockey saw the Prime Minister after the announcement on International Women's Day on March 2010.

Mr Hockey said he was left 'irked' and 'offended' that although Mr Abbott had given him the Treasury portfolio, he had not been consulted on the massive $5.5 billion spending commitment to introduce the policy.

Yet resolving the issue and talking it out like 'two old mates', Mr Hockey says in the book that the pair 'sort of had a heart-to-heart', where he told the then Opposition leader: 'We can't do this. It's not the way'.

The conversation ensured a commitment between the two to support each other publicly, yet just one-year later, the Treasure was not supported by the Prime Minister when he suggested family trusts should be taxed the same way as companies.

The paid parental leave scheme was considered by many to be a ploy to attract female voters, with Mr Hockey not initially sold on and threats at the time that MPs and senators could cross the floor to vote against it.

Previously the scheme was to see six months paid leave at full salary up to $150,000 a year funded by a 1.7 per cent levy on company tax above $5 million to controversially cover the costs.

Since first announced, Mr Hockey's stance has swayed and he stated he would support the scheme if the Coalition could assure its funding.

Speaking after the launch of the book on Thursday morning, Mr Hockey did not answer questions regarding the fact Mr Murdoch was approached about the policy before he was.

But he said Prime Minister Tony Abbott was an 'outstanding individual' who he got on well with.

'I think what's disappointing some commentators [about the book] is that we are are quite close,' he said.

'And that's a welcome change between a Treasurer and Prime Minister.'
