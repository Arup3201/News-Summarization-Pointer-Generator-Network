Once upon a time... in a land far, far away... there were some very pretty girls who were famous throughout the kingdom for their long, flowing locks, their smooth, flawless skin, their luscious lips and their big, sparkling eyes. And these girls were known as supermodels.

And each of these supermodels bore an uncanny resemblance to.... a Disney cartoon princess.

At least, that's the fairy tale according to the Huffington Post, who have matched up a number of fair-of-face clothes-horses including Cara Delevingne, Edie Campbell, Lily Cole and with their Disney doppelganger. Can you tell the real-life

Merida, the heroine from Brave, and brainy British beauty Lily Cole both
have wild auburn hair, soft round faces, pink cheeks and big blue eyes

With their dreamy expressions, big lips, flowing blonde locks, sturdy eyebrows and strong jawlines, Natalia Vodianova and Sleeping Beauty could be sisters... if one wasn't a cartoon

The news site pairs Merida, the red-haired heroine from Brave, with brainy British beauty Lily Cole, who shares her wild, untamed locks, her soft, round face and pink cheeks, her big blue eyes, her button nose and rosebud pout.

Also linked are blonde Russian mother-of-three Natalia Vodianova with Sleeping Beauty, the dreamy, nature-loving Disney darling with the tiny frame and enviable bone structure.

Ariel, also known as the Little Mermaid, loved singing with her friend Sebastian the crab, and Karen Elson is also a singer in her own right, spurred on by her musical ex-husband Jack White of The White Stripes, The Raconteurs and The Dead Weather

Rapunzel and model-of-the-moment Cara Delevingne, 20, have similarly youthful alabaster skin, long straight blonde hair and inquisitive expressions

Paired with Ariel the Little Mermaid is musician Jack White's ex-wife,  British model Karen Elson, who has hair the same rust red colour as Sebastian the crab's best friend under the sea.

Girl-about-town and model-of-the-moment Cara Delevingne, 20, gets linked up with the blonde poppet with the famously long hair, Rapunzel, while tempestuous Naomi Campbell is said to be the doppelganger of Tiana, the beautiful belle in Disney's The Princess And The Frog.

Also matched together are Snow White and young model Edie Campbell, Pocahontas and Liya Kebede, and Belle from Beauty And The Beast with Jacquelyn Jablonski.

Huffington Post then pairs up some other Disney characters... with their political doppelgangers.

Which cartoon hero (or perhaps baddie) do you look like?
