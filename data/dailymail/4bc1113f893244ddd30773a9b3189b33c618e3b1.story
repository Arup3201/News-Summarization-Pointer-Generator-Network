CDC Director Dr. Thomas Frieden began his grilling Thursday on Capitol Hill with a stark admission that his agency is still searching for ways to combat the Ebola virus as it burrows into the United States.

'We're always open to ideas for what we can do to keep Americans safe,' Frieden said in his opening statement, in a startling departure from his prepared remarks in the face of a hostile and impatient panel in a House Energy and Commerce subcommittee.

'We would consider any options to better protect Americans,' he said later during the hearing's Q&A period.

Frieden's statements will not inspire already-shattered public confidence. The first Ebola patient identified on U.S. soil, Thomas Eric Duncan, was misdiagnosed. 

Two nurses caring for him have since contracted the body-destroying hemorrhagic fever – one of whom got on a flight with the CDC's blessing a day before she was hospitalized.

Taking on fire: CDC chief Thomas Frieden (center) has come to represent an agency labeled incompetent on Capitol Hill as Ebola takes hold and spreads

Circus: A Capitol Hill hearing room was overrun by photographers and reporters on Thursday as the CDC's top man faced questions

An uncomfortable Frieden parried with members of Congress for more than two hours, projecting little confidence and insisting at every turn that he was open to new ideas

The excruciating hearing came as three members of Congress and a sitting governor are calling for Frieden's resignation and the White House began the torturous process of throwing him under the disease-control bus on Thursday afternoon, saying that Frieden is 'taking responsibility' for his agency's screw-ups.

White House Press Secretary Josh Earnest told reporters that the CDC director was responsible – implying that President Barack Obama is not.

'You have seen, at least in a couple instances, Dr. Frieden taking responsibility' for the CDC's widely panned response, he said.

That plan included stepped-up Ebola screenings at five major U.S. airports – announced a week ago but only put in place on Thursday. Airports in New York, New Jersey, Atlanta, Chicago and Washington, D.C. are affected.

Frieden was on the hottest seat in the hearing room after his agency's officials told one of the infected nurses that she could travel Monday on a commercial airplane – even though she treated the first patient and worked alongside the other nurse, who had already tested positive.

The woman, Amber Vinson, traveled to Ohio to help with plans for her wedding and returned to Dallas on a Frontier Airlines plane.

The news that she had spent time in Cleveland, and that three of her relatives work at Kent State University, sent the region into panic mode.

Schools and hospitals are on lock-down across Cuyahoga and surrounding counties. And one store visited by her friends has been closed until it can be assessed. 

'My understanding is that she did contact the CDC,' Frieden conceded Thursday, responding to questions from the House panel while saying he did not participate in the call. 

'I have not seen the transcript of the conversation,' he added, casting blame on Vinson. 'My understanding is that she reported no symptoms to us.' 

It has been reported that she told the CDC she had a slightly raised temperature of 99.5F - but the CDC only classes anything above 100.4F as a fever. 

Frieden confessed the CDC is still not sure how Vinson and her co-worker, Nina Pham, contracted the Ebola virus. 

'While we do not yet know exactly how these transmissions occurred,' he said, 'they demonstrate the need to strengthen the procedures for infection-control protocols which allowed for exposure to the virus.'

'She reported no symptoms to us': Frieden shifted blame for his agency's approval of an Ebola-exposed nurse to fly on a commercial jet

White House Press Secretary Josh Earnest said Frieden is 'taking responsibility' for the flawed Ebola containment plan, suggesting that the Office of the President will be insulated from the backlash

Nurses Nina Pham (left) and Amber Vinson (right) cared for Thomas Duncan, whose case of Ebola was the first diagnosed in the US. They have both subsequently landed in isolation themselves with the viral infection

'Protocol' problems: Dallas nurse Briana Aguirre told the TODAY show that she and other health care workers who came into contact with patient Thomas Duncan wore hazmat suits with large gaps near the neck

Dr. Daniel Varga, the chief clinical officer at Texas Presbyterian Hospital, also testified that his staff hadn't yet cracked the mystery.

'That's correct,' he said. 

Pham will be transferred soon from Dallas to a National Institutes of Health facility's special isolation unit in Washington, D.C. 

The nurses episode, along with the Obama administration's insistence that air travel must continue between the U.S. and the three hardest-hit African countries – Liberia, Sierra Leone and Guinea – had Republican lawmakers hopping mad.

'People are scared. We need all hands on deck. We need a strategy,' barked Michigan Rep. Fred Upton, who chairs the full Energy and Commerce Committee. 'We need to protect the American people, first and foremost.'

'This is not a drill,' he said, 'a fact that the doctors and nurses working on the front lines understand. People’s lives are at stake, and the response so far has been unacceptable.'

Pennsylvania Rep. Tim Murphy, who helms the Oversight and Investigations Subcommittee, said the stakes 'couldn't be any higher.'

'The number of Ebola cases in West Africa is doubling about every three weeks. The math still favors the virus, even with the recent surge in global response,' he added.

'With no vaccine or cure, we are facing down a disease for which there is no room for error. We cannot afford to look back at this point in history and say we could have done more.'

Dr. Anthony Fauci, who leads the National Institute of Allergy and Infectious Diseases, provided little reason for enthusiasm.

'We are still in the early stages of understanding how infection with the Ebola virus can be treated and prevented,' Fauci admitted in a written statement.

'People are scared. We need all hands on deck,' said Rep. Fred Upton, a Michigan Republican. 'This is not a drill'

Horror: 9,000 west Africans have been diagnosed with Ebola and health authorities expect it to ultimately kill 70 per cent of those it infects

Arizona Congressman Paul Gosar demanded Frieden's resignation Thursday afternoon.

'CDC Director Thomas Frieden has failed to lead and has shown gross incompetence in his actions or lack thereof to prevent the spread of Ebola domestically,' Gosar said in a statement.

'We cannot afford such mistakes when American lives are at risk. That is why I am calling for the immediate resignation of Director Friedan (sic).'

He joined fellow Republican Rep. Tom Marino of Pennsylvania, who said late Wednesday that the 'false sense of security' the CDC has offered 'is exactly the opposite of the CDC director’s primary responsibilities – to communicate clearly and honestly.'

'I have no ill will towards him personally but he should resign his position effective immediately,' Marino said.

After Thursday's hearing, South Dakota Sen. John Thune and Florida Gov. Rick Scott both called on Frieden to get the axe.

Their comments came during conservative radio host Laura Ingraham's Thursday broadcast.

As of October 12 the World Health Organization reported 8,997 confirmed Ebola cases in Africa and 4,493 documented deaths.

So far the U.S. has seen only three confirmed cases, one of which claimed the patient's life.That man, Thomas Duncan, was a Liberian national who traveled to Dallas in September. 

A clinician at Texas Presbyterian Hospital failed to note that he had come from an Ebola-stricken country, and he was sent home with antibiotics to treat his fever.

Days later he returned and was placed in isolation until his death on Oct. 8.

SHOCK: Dr. Daniel Varga (on video monitor), chief clinical officer of Texas Health Resources, said Thursday that Texas Presbyterian Hospital staff had no targeted Ebola containment training

Angry Americans responded Thursday to  Frieden's casual statement that the CDC is still looking for suggestions about how to tackle the Ebola crisis

'All hands on deck': President Barack Obama said Wednesday after a two-hour cabinet meeting that the US government is fully engaged to battle the infection and stop it from spreading widely

Varga, the hospital administrator, admitted on Wednesday that his organization erred in turning Duncan away at first.

'Unfortunately, in our initial treatment of Mr. Duncan, despite our best intentions and a highly skilled medical team, we made mistakes,' he told Congress. 

'We did not correctly diagnose his symptoms as those of Ebola. We are deeply sorry.'

Varga testified Thursday via video link. After acknowledging that he had distributed the CDC's Ebola protocol to the hospital's department in the early days of Ebola's African resurgence, he stunned the hearing room by admitting that his staff had no specialized training to prepare.

Briana Aguirre, a Dallas nurse who helped treat Duncan, told NBC's Today show on Thursday that the CDC's Ebola protocols didn't help her and her coworkers cover up adequately in the hospital.

Her and others' hazmat suits, she said, had large gaps between the bodysuit and the headpiece, exposing several inches of their necks. 

'We never talked about Ebola,' she said. 'We were never told what to look for.'

The hospital had hosted an optional seminar on Ebola, but there was no hands-on training included. 

When she realized her zipped-up hazmat suit didn't fully protect her, Aguirre said, 'I threw a fit. I just couldn't believe it, in the second week of an Ebola crisis at my hospital, the only gear they were offering us allowed our necks to be uncovered.'
