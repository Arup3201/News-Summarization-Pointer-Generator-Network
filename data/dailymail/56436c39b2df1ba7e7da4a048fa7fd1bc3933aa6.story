A woman whose fiance watched her fall to her death off a 25-metre cliff during a camping trip was imprisoned for threatening to kill a former lover.

Campbelltown couple Paul Veitch and Megan Moody were at the popular swimming hole, Mermaid Pools near Tahmoor, south-west of Sydney, when the 38-year-old plunged to her death on Tuesday night.

It has now emerged Ms Moody had threatened a past employer she had sex with once, saying she would 'take to [him] with a f***ing knife' in a text message, and was sent to prison for 10 days over the incident in 2007, The Daily Telegraph reported.

Campbelltown couple Paul Veitch and Megan Moody were at the popular swimming hole, Mermaid Pools near Tahmoor, when the 38-year-old plunged to her death on Tuesday night

The couple had been engaged for two months when Ms Moody slipped while collecting water with a billy can

Ms Moody had previously worked at a real estate agency in Geelong before her move to Sydney and was fired from her role in 2009.

When this happened, she sent more than 160 text messages to her former employer, with one reading: 'You know this is ending in death, don't you?'

In another, she wrote: 'You give me a dead grandmother and I'll give your parents a dead son. Either way, I'm going to kill you.'

The man who these messages were directed at filed an apprehended violence order (AVO) against Ms Moody in 2010, but she breached it.

Mr Veitch tried to revive her after he made his way down the cliff  and found his fiancee's unconscious body

When she was unresponsive, he made his way back to their campsite and called for emergency services

Ms Moody was also questioned three months ago over the stabbing of Mr Veitch but was not charged.

In August, an AVO was applied for in Campbelltown Court to prevent Ms Moody from living with, stalking or assaulting Mr Veitch and safeguard him.

The couple had been engaged for two months when Ms Moody slipped while collecting water with a billy can about 8.30pm two days ago, The Sydney Morning Herald reported.  

Mr Veitch, 36, tried to revive her after he made his way down the cliff to the isolated spot and found his fiancee's unconscious body. 

When she was unresponsive, he made his way back to their campsite and called for emergency services.

Police are still trying to determine what led to Ms Moody's death - whether she had lost her footing or she had jumped, according to News Corp.

On September 4, Mr Veitch announced his engagement to 'Meg' on Facebook after being together for just six months and said she had made him 'real happy'.

'I lashed out and offered to marry her,' he wrote.

'Geez it felt good when i got told to bugger off nar jokes the ring fit an she said yes woohoo my meg rules hah anutha 9 day in paradise party on (sic).'

Three days later after the engagement, Mr Veitch - who listed his occupation as a prawn trawler -posted a selfie of him and Ms Moody smiling at 'a cool little pad up the mountains'.

Police said Ms Moody's death appeared to be an accident but they were still investigating the matter

Police will prepare a report for the coroner 

The couple had been planning on spending the night at Mermaid Pools with police warning people to be careful when camping near cliffs.

'Just a general warning to people who are attending these sort of areas of a night time - particularly if people are intoxicated,' Inspector Michael Bright told ABC Radio.

'There's no lighting, it's quite a high area - there's a lot of cliff face around it and there's also no mobile service so if something goes wrong it's an area where you're not going to get a quick response from emergency services.'

Police will prepare a report for the coroner.
