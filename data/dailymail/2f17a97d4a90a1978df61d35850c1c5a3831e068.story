On trial: Stuart King punched one staff member twice and pushed another down some stairs after a party got out of control at his hotel

A real-life Basil Fawlty who attacked two of his employees when they made a mess during a staff party at his hotel has walked free from court.

Stuart King, 47, flew into a rage when the two male employees spilt nail varnish on a freshly-refurbished area of the Clarice House hotel and spa in Suffolk.

King, the hotel's managing director, frog marched the pair to the reception area before he punched James Flatman, 27, twice in the face and pushed James Biancu, 30, down a flight of stairs.

He denied the attack but was found guilty of two charges of assault after a trial at Bury St Edmunds Magistrates' Court.

Sentencing the hotelier to a one year community order, District Judge Morgan Jones said: 'The view that I took and take is that you had lost your temper.

'You were very angry, understandably so, but you had lost your temper.

'Your behaviour, it was almost like you were frog marching somebody who misbehaved themselves.

'You are taking the law into your own hands and you cannot do that.

'These were your employees but that gives you no right to use physical force.'

The court heard King and his victims had been at the hotel for a staff party on the evening of January 26 this year.

But despite specific warnings to staff not to go near the newly refurbished spa, tipsy Mr Biancu and Mr Flatman went into the facility.

The pair then spilled nail varnish over the newly painted wall, sending King into his blind rage Magistrates' heard.

King had originally planned to get the employees to clean up the mess and leave the staff party but he flipped and attacked them instead.

Police were called to the hotel to calm the situation but King resisted arrest - an offence he pleaded guilty to at court.

Stephen Harvey, mitigating, told the court: 'He's a man of principle, a successful man, a hard-working man who devotes his life to the business.'

King was sentenced to a community order for one year and told to complete 40 hours of unpaid work.

He will also pay costs of £1,240 and a £60 victim surcharge. A third assault charge against the hotelier was dismissed.

His attack is similar to the fits of anger fictional hotel owner Basil Fawlty would fly into with his waiter Manuel.

Fawlty, famously played by Monty Python John Cleese, also lost his temper with his temperamental car - giving it 'a damn good seeing to' with a tree.
