Royston Drenthe has signed for Turkish top flight club Kayseri Erciyesspor on a permanent deal from Reading.

The former Real Madrid winger has struggled to settle at any club since leaving the Bernabeu in 2012, playing for four different sides both on loan and permanently.

From Madrid, via a loan spell at Everton, he joined Alania Vladikavkaz in Russia, but after just six appearances he moved again - to Reading.

He has spent two years at the Madejski, including a loan spell with Sheffield Wednesday, but only made a handful of appearances.

Speaking to the club's website, manager Steve Clarke commented: 

'Royston Drenthe is, without doubt, a talented player but sometimes, in football, transfers don’t deliver what they promise. 

'That’s been the case for Royston at Reading FC so it’s best for both parties that he moves on and we wish him well for the future.'
