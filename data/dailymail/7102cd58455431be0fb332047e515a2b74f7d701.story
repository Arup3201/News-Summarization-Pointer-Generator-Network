A 'would-be assassin' who aimed a gun at the head of a Bulgarian politician as he was giving a speech had no intention of killing his victim, it has been suggested.

Oktay Enimehmedov stormed the stage at the National Palace of Culture in Bulgaria's capital Sofia on Saturday during a political conference and held the gun at the head of Ahmed Dogan, leader of the Movement for Rights and Freedoms.

But it has now been revealed the gunman used a gas pistol loaded with pepper spray that would not have killed the opposition leader.

Bulgaria's deputy chief prosecutor 
Borislav Sarafov told Sofia news agency novinite.com that the stunt 
cannot be deemed an attempt on Dogan's life because of the gas handgun 
used.

He said: 'With this gun one cannot kill a person. With these bullets one can't kill a person either.'

Television footage showed the 
25-year-old jumping out of the audience and interrupting the speech by 
58-year-old Dogan, who has led the party for almost a quarter of a 
century.

In a split second, he raises the gun to Mr Dogan's head but it appeared to misfire.

Enimehmedov managed to gain access to the Movement for Rights and Freedom party's annual conference

The politician then knocked the gun away and fell to the floor as he attempted to flee.

Security guards and delegates rushed onto the stage where they wrestled the attacker to the ground.

A separate group surrounded a shocked Mr Dogan in a protective shield.

Politicians then appeared from the audience and began stamping on Enimehmedov as he lay on the ground.

He was later pictured being taken away by police bloodied and bruised.

Prosecutors are now considering charging those who hit Enimehmedov.

The liberal MRF party represents 
ethnic Turks and other Muslims who make up about 12 per cent of 
Bulgaria's 7.3 million-strong population.

Enimehmedov, an ethnic Turk 
from the eastern city of Burgas, could now face six years behind bars.

Dogan, who resigned after the incident, was seen as one of the country's most influential political figures.

Two years ago he was acquitted after a
 high-profile corruption trial into payments he received as a consultant
 for a hydro power project.
