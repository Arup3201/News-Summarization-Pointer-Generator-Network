With a greyhound stadium and ice rink among its main attractions, the charms of Romford are modest in comparison to some areas.

But there may be a very good reason for moving to the Essex town.

Its residents are the luckiest in the UK, according to research carried out by the National Lottery.

Jackpot joy: One adult in every 1,238 in Romford have won a prize of more than £50,000 since the National Lottery began

Hit the jackpot: Total winnings in Romford, including jackpots claimed by 84 ticketholders, come to £165million

More than 300 people there have won a prize of £50,000 or more since the Lottery began in 1994 - equivalent to one in every 1,238 adults.

The total winnings, including jackpots claimed by 84 ticketholders, come to £165million.

The second luckiest place to live is Enfield in north London, which scored big wins for one in every 1,378 people.

Dartford is third with a ratio of 1,391 to one.

Outside the top three, however, northern communities dominate the Lottery’s league table of luck.

The top ten includes Newcastle, Sunderland, Liverpool and Warrington.

The most successful region is the North East, which has banked more than 1,550 major prizes worth more than £745million.

Streets paved with Lotto gold: Enfield, north London, is the second luckiest place in Britain, according to a National Lottery study

It is followed closely by Wales and the North West as hotspots for good fortune.

The findings follow a survey yesterday which said the happiest places to live in the UK were in the north.

The study by property website Rightmove, which was based on 12 indicators including the size and condition of homes, neighbourliness and safety, found the unhappiest places were generally in or around London.

Among the top ten - or bottom ten, depending on how you look at it - was Romford, whose famous sons include Manchester City goalkeeper Stuart Taylor and former Arsenal and England defender Tony Adams.

Michael White, the leader of Havering Council, said yesterday: ‘I’ve always believed that people make their own luck so it’s great to see that Romford is the luckiest place in the UK.’ A National Lottery spokesman said: ‘This is the first time that we have included prizes of £50,000 upwards, giving a true snapshot of where the luckiest players are based.

‘Now Romford has picked up the winning streak - perhaps the only way really is Essex.’
