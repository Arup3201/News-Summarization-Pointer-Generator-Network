A student who became infatuated with his singing teacher while she taught him Celine Dion's My Heart Will Go On has been given an indefinite restraining order against her.

Aspiring singer Ashley Formby, 27, sent teacher Helen Sedgwick, 26, flowers, cards, romantic emails and a model of the Titanic after falling in love with her during their one-on-one music lessons.

A court heard that Formby began messaging Miss Sedgwick in March saying he wanted to be her lover, not her pupil, and calling her 'the most beautiful girl in the world.'

However, Ms Sedgwick shunned his advances, and after continually being bombarded with love letters, emails and gifts, reported him to police for stalking.

The court heard that Miss Sedgwick rejected Formby's advances, but after he continued sending her cards and emails she called the police

Prosecutor Sharon Anderson told Llandrindod Wells magistrates court: 'Formby sent her flowers, gifts, emails and texts declaring his love for her.

'Ms Sedgwick responded telling him she was not interested in his approaches and found them inappropriate.

'But he continued to contact her, the tone of these new emails caused her anxiety and she was worried he’d attended her address. He told her he loved her.' 

Eventually Miss Sedgwick took out a harrassment notice against Formby, but for the next 12 weeks he sent her her eight emails, a romantic card, three texts, and turned up at her home with flowers.

Formby was interviewed by officers and told them he felt he had a 'special bond' with Ms Sedgwick and that he had been 'devastated' when she rejected him.

Josie Flicker, defending, said: 'He doesn’t threaten violence, he is quite eloquent and shows genuine emotion. But he became quite childish when she rejected his advances.

'Since his arrest there has been no repetition, he seems to have heeded the warning from police.'

Formby admitted pursuing a course of harassment. He was given a 12 month community order.

He was also given an indefinite restraining order meaning he must not contact Ms Sedgwick in any way. Formby was also ordered to pay £85 costs and a £60 victim surcharge.
