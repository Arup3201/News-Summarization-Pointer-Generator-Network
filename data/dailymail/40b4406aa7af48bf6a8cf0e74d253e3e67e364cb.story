President Barack Obama insisted on Wednesday that he would not send ground troops into Iraqi combat zones to fight the ISIS terrorist army, directly contradicting his top general who said a day earlier that the president asked him for boots-on-the-ground recommendations 'on a case-by-case basis.' 

In a gymnasium full of servicemen and women at MacDill Air Force Base in Tampa, Florida, Obama seemed also to push back against the political battering he's taken in recent days, making broad claims of America's greatness while he's at the helm.

'I want to be clear,' he said, 'The American forces that have been deployed to Iraq do not and will not have a combat mission. They will support Iraqi forces on the ground as they fight for their own country against these terrorists.'

'As your commander-in-chief,' Obama insisted, 'I will not commit you and the rest of our armed forces to fighting another ground war in Iraq.'

On Tuesday, however, Joint Chiefs chairman Gen. Martin Dempsey told lawmakers that circumstances on the ground could drive him to push for American combat troops to be embedded with Iraqi army units.

'If we reach the point where I believe our advisers should accompany Iraqi troops on attacks against specific ISIL targets,' Dempsey said, using an alternative name for the terror group, 'I will recommend that to the president.'

Dempsey was testifying before the Senate Armed Services Committee. 

Asked by New Hampshire Republican Sen. Kelly Ayotte whether the president had ruled out the use of American ground forces in a combat role, Dempsey responded, 'Yes. But he has told me as well to come back to him on a case-by-case basis.'

He said that if needed, he 'would go back to the president and make a recommendation that may include the use of ground forces.'

But on Wednesday Obama was single-minded, dismissing all thoughts of putting U.S. troops in the path of incoming fire. American forces are currently limited to an advisory role, which includes direct contact with Iraqi command centers.

'We'll use our air power,' Obama assured his audience of soldiers, drawing his boundaries. 'We will train and equip our partners. We will advise them and we will assist them. We will lead a broad coalition of countries who have a stake in this fight.'

Citing both the Iraq conflict and the emergence of a new Ebola virus epidemic in west Africa, Obama emphasized what he said were 'America's unique abilities and responsibilities to lead.'

On Monday night the White House announced a deployment of 3,000 ground troops and Army engineers to intervene in Liberia, a country that has already seen more than 2,400 diagnosed cases and 1,300 deaths from the disease.

'It is America that has the unique capability to mobilize against an organization like ISIL,' he said. 'In a world full of broader social challenges, it is America that has the unique capability and know-how to help contain and combat a threat like Ebola.'

And underscoring his mop-up approach to diplomacy and his renewed emphasis on international aid payments, Obama said the world is still reliant on the U.S. to help solve its largest problems.

'That's the story, across the board,' he said. 

'If there is a hurricane, if there is a typhoon, if there is some sort of crisis, if there is an earthquake, if there is a need for a rescue mission, when the world is threatened and the world needs help, it calls on America.'

'Even the countries that complain about America: When they need help, who do they call? They call on us.'

'And then,' he told his military audience, 'America calls on you.'

The president's biggest applause line: 'Our reach is long. If you threaten America, you will find no safe haven. We will find you eventually'

Contradiction: Gen. Martin Dempsey, the chairman of the military's Joint Chiefs of Staff, told a US Senate panel on Tuesday that Obama asked him to make ground-troop recommendations 'on a case-by-case basis'

'This is a moment of American leadership,' Obama said. 'And thanks to you, it is a moment that we are gonna meet.' 

Aside from his early roll call of the various armed services, Obama's biggest applause line was his direct threat to ISIS. 

'Whether in Iraq or in Syria,' the president said, 'these terrorists will learn the same thing that leaders of al-Qaeda already know: We mean what we say.'

'Our reach is long. If you threaten America, you will find no safe haven. We will find you eventually.'

Less popular was his triumphant statement to the servicemen and women that 'in three months, because of you, our combat mission will be over in Afghanistan and our war in Afghanistan will come to a responsible end.'

Pausing for applause, Obama was met instead by silence – suddenly reminiscent of the tepid response he received during an August 26 speech to the American Legion.

'That's because of you,' he said again.
