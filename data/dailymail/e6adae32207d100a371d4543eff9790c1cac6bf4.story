Puerto Ricans voted toward statehood on Tuesday aiming to potentially become the United States' 51st state.

In a two-part referendum 75,188 or 53 per cent voted to change Puerto Ricoâ€™s 114-year relationship with the U.S. with 65 per cent voting in favour of statehood among alternatives of greater autonomy or independence.

Despite the 4 million citizens in the U.S. island territory unable to vote in the U.S. presidential election, many were excited to participate in the referendum.

Voting for unity: Men enthusiastically hang out a moving car's window while waving a Puerto Rican flag as the people voted in favour of statehood

Rejoice: Supporters of the pro-statehood New Progressive Party wave flags after casting their vote to elect the local government and participate in their fourth political status plebiscite

Among the 243 of 1,643 precincts reporting on late Tuesday, 47 per cent, or 67,304 voters, supported the status quo.

On the second question, opposing the statehood vote, 31 per cent cast their ballots for sovereign free association and 4 per cent for independence.

Both President Barack Obama and rival Mitt Romney said they supported 
the referendum, with Obama pledging to respect the will of the people if
there was a clear majority. Any change would require approval by the 
U.S. Congress.

Car horns blared and party flags waved after polling stations closed following what election officials said was a high voter turnout. During the day, many voters carried umbrellas against the blistering tropical sun as temperatures neared 90 degrees Fahrenheit (31 degrees Celsius).

Gubernatorial: With votes dually cast for governor people from the pro-statehood New Progressive Party are seen reacting to Alejandro Garcia Padill lead and eventual win

Shared votes: A voter for statehood waved an American flag, left, while another held her Puerto Rican flag while cheering toward the gubernatorial election's race

Status quo: Followers of the Popular Democratic Party, favouring the island's current political status that earned 47 per cent of votes, play in front of their party after casting their vote

'Puerto Rico has to be a state. There is no other option,' said 25-year-old Jerome Lefebre, who picked up his grandfather before driving to the polls. 'We're doing OK, but we could do better. We would receive more benefits, a lot more financial help.'

But 42-year-old Ramon Lopez de Azua said he favoured the current system, which grants U.S. citizenship but prevents Puerto Ricans from voting for president unless they live in the United States, and gives those on the island only limited representation in Congress.

'Puerto Rico's problem is not its political status,' he said. 'I think that the United States is the best country in the world, but I am Puerto Rican first.'

Withstanding: Voters wait in line to cast their ballots at a polling station in San Juan, during the day many voters carried umbrellas against the blistering tropical sun as temperatures neared 90 degrees Fahrenheit (31 degrees Celsius)

Excitement: The U.S. island territory's 4 million citizens were unable to vote in the U.S. presidential election on Tuesday but many were excited to participate in the referendum

Tight race: Claudio Manuel Cepeda Ayala, 75, is seen casting his vote to elect the local government narrowly won by Alejandro Garcia Padilla, whose Popular Democratic Party favours the status quo

Puerto Rico held non-binding referendums in 1967, 1993 and 1998, with statehood never garnering a clear majority and independence never obtaining more than 5 per cent of the vote.

The island also was electing legislators and a governor, with Gov Luis Fortuno of the pro-statehood New Progressive Party seeking a second term.

Gov Fortuno, a Republican, was challenged by Alejandro Garcia Padilla, whose Popular Democratic Party favours the status quo.

With 817 of 1,643 precincts reporting late Tuesday, Garcia had 427,604 votes, or 48 per cent, while Gov Fortuno had 422,506 votes, or 47 per cent.
