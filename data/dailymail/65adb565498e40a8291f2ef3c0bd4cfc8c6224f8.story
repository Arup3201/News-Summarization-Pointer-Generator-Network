Swansea boss Garry Monk was disappointed with referee Michael Oliver's decision to award the hosts their first-half penalty which changed the game, calling the decision a 'disgrace' as Stoke won 2-1 at the Britannia Stadium.

With just over 10 minutes of the first half to go, Stoke's Ryan Shawcross conceded a penalty by bringing down Wilfried Bony and the Ivory Coast striker made no mistake as he slotted the ball past Asmir Begovic into the bottom right corner.

Their lead did not last long as - nine minutes later - the Potters were awarded a penalty, with Angel Rangel challenging Victor Moses, but it looked as if the Nigerian went down easily.

Adam fired home with a left-footed shot to make it 1-1 at the break. 

Jonathan Walters nodded his powerful header home from substitute Oussama Assaidi's cross as Stoke went ahead for the first time deep into the second half and the Swans never found a way back despite some late pressure.

On the two penalty decisions, Monk said: 'The first - it was a penalty, I've watched it back. Shawcross I think it is that has his hands all over Bony and twists him around and knocks him, pulls Bony to the ground - so for me that's a penalty.

'The penalty against is a disgrace. It's a disgraceful decision. Not in a million years is it a penalty and the problem we'll have with it now is a lot of games we're having this season a match-changing decision is going against us constantly and I don't see anything being done about it.

'I've spoke to the referees about it and the association about it and I don't hear anything from (referee chief) Mike Riley coming back to me at all, which I find poor leadership and the whole thing is becoming to mount up now which is becoming a very worrying situation.

Swansea manager Garry Monk called the decisions a disgrace as his side failed to win again

'It's happening a lot. We're having a lot of decisions going against us. Match-changing decsions and it's a disgraceful decision because not in a million years - I looked straight at their bench and even they (Stoke) couldn't believe it.

'He (Victor Moses) should be punished for diving, it's a clear dive which is cheating. He's cheated the ref and then the ref's cheated us for giving the decision that never was.

'I just think it's a poor, poor decision and it's cost us at a vital time where we're just coming up to half-time - we should have been coming in 1-0 up and it's a different game then, a different game plan for us second half.'

He added: 'We have talked about being clinical and coming to a place like this the chances wouldn't be flowing so the very good chances that we had should have been goals but unfortunately we couldn't take them.'

Man of the match Charlie Adam was delighted as Stoke returned to winning ways.

He told Sky Sports 1: 'I think it was (well deserved). Once we got a grip on the game. Wilfried Bony caused us a couple of problems during the game in the first half.

Walters was clearly delighted with his impact as Stoke held out against some late pressure from Swansea

'There were too many balls going to his feet and he was able to turn and he and (Gylfi Sigurdsson) have managed to link up really well this year and we noticed that in the video. And once we got to grips with that and in the end I thought we desreved the victory.

'We stopped the ball getting to his feet... when you've got that and the movement they've got with people like Sigurdsson and (Nathan) Dyer on one side and (Wayne) Routledge on the other it's difficult to defend, and we had a tough time of it.

'But once we got to grips with it we dominated the second part of the game and Walters came on and won it for us.'
