'Pot princess' Kayla Mendoza, 21, was charged with DUI manslaughter on Monday in Florida

A 21-year-old woman who tweeted '2 drunk 2 care' hours before she killed two young women in a car crash has made her first appearance in court, as the victims' families, who say they hope she is locked up forever.

Kayla Mendoza, a self-proclaimed 'pothead princess' is still recovering from injuries she sustained in the crash five months ago that resulted in the deaths of Marisa Catronio and Kaitlyn Ferrante, both 21.

On Monday she was wheeled into Broward County Jail, Florida, on a stretcher, covering her face with a sheet while the victims' families gathered outside the gates.

The following day, she appeared in a wheelchair before Circuit Judge John 'Jay' Hurley, who set a $600,000 bond. If she makes bond, she will be placed under house arrest.

Judge Hurley referred to court documents that alleged Mendoza's blood-alcohol levels were above the legal limit and that she did not have a valid license on the night of the crash, Nov. 17 last year.

He also cited Mendoza's Twitter post before the crash which state she was '2 drunk 2 care', when Mendoza's attorney claimed that she may have been the victim of 'involuntary intoxication'.

Less than three hours before the wrong-way crash on November 17 last year, Mendoza tweeted that she was '2 drunk 2 care'

Mendoza, a sales assistant, faces two counts of DUI 
manslaughter while impaired, two counts of DUI manslaughter with an 
unlawful blood-alcohol level, two counts of vehicular homicide and two 
counts of driving without a license and causing death. She suffered a brain injury and broken legs in the crash.

Gary Catronio, Marisa's father, said that Mendoza had 'changed the lives of our family forever.'

'You took my baby girl,' he said, according to CBS Miami. ' You took my baby girl. You took my wife's best friend. You made bad decision that night. The right decision was to have a friend drive you home.'

Christine Ferrante, the mother of Kaitlyn, said: 'I don't want her to ever feel the sunshine ever.

'I want her to stay locked away forever.'

Earlier this week, family members said that waiting so long to see Mendoza charged has been difficult but that they understood investigators had a complex task and wanted to be certain there were no legal loopholes.

On the night of the crash, 20-year-old Mendoza had been drinking at the Tijuana Taxi Company in Coral Springs.

Around 8pm, she tweeted the words '2 drunk 2 care' - just hours before climbing into her car and  allegedly causing the horrific wrong-way crash on the Sawgrass Expressway.

Marisa Catronio was pronounced dead at the scene around 2am on November 17 last year. Kaitlyn Ferrante was taken to hospital but died from her injuries four days later.  

The best friends had been heading 
home to Coral Springs in Miss Ferrante's 2012 Toyota Camry after a night
 out when they were struck by a Hyundai Sonata driven by Mendoza, police
 said.

Mendoza was heading east in the 
westbound lanes when she slammed head-on into Catronio's red Camry 
driven by Ferrante, west of University Drive.

The two friends were out celebrating Miss Catronio's 21st birthday.

Mendoza was not shy about her drug and alcohol use on her social media accounts.  Posting
 under the user name 'Kaila Mendoza,' the T-Mobile sales associate had 
fired off dozens of tweets about being high and rolling joints.

In the weeks leading up to the crash, Mendoza tweeted that her 'car permanently smells like weed’ and boasted about 'rolling a blunt in the airport parking lot'.
