A National Hunt photographer escaped serious injury after the bookies favourite careered off the course taking one of his main challengers with him. 

With just two fences left to go in the Glenfarclas Handicap Chase, Nina Carberry on the JP McManus owned Quantitativeeasing was advancing along the rail when Jonathan Plougaou aboard the French favourite Toutancarmont ploughed into the Irish horse - forcing both of them off the track. 

Miss Carberry's horse went through the rail, knocking down photographer Patrick McCann from the Racing Post.

Mr McCann was treated at the scene by medics and had one of his legs placed in a splint before being taken away to hospital. 

Both jockeys and horses escaped injury following the crash, just two from home.

Mr McCann is being taken to Southmead hospital in Bristol with a suspected broken leg.

The drama let Davy Russel aboard the 16-1 shot Rivage d'Or make it a double for Davy Russell and Ryanair chief executive Michael O'Leary, who won the first race of the day. 

Shortly before the incident, Ms Carberry was covering the ground very well and just jumped clear into second place when the French horse slewed hard to the left, crashing into the Irish challenger. 

Mr McCann was standing about 30 feet from the fence beside the rail when Quantativeeasing was forced through the plastic barrier. 

Mr McCann tried to dive out of the way, but he was struck by the rail, which is designed to give way if a horse loses control. 

The eventual winner of the race was just three lengths behind when the incident happened and jockey Davy Russell used the space which suddenly became available to power home to victory.

Mr McCann attempted to jump clear of the scene as he noticed the horses rapidly approaching  

Cheltenham spokeswoman Sophia Brudenell told The Racing Post: 'Patrick was standing at the second-last fence. He's a regular racing photographer who understands the rules and at the moment, as it reads, we're not concerned with where he was standing. He was under the running rail and seemed to be moving away as the horses approached. 

'Having looked at the images, the horse didn't go over him, he brushed past him rather than trampled over him. The horses just moved to their left as they were jumping, Patrick was in that position off the rail, where we'd expect him to be. They did violently move to the left and Patrick felt the consequence.'

Stewards at the course reviewed the accident and noted that Any Currency, which finished second had 'jinked left' approaching the penultimate fence. This forced Toutancarmont to jump left into Ms Carberry's horse. 

The stewards said the incident did not involve a riding offence. 

However, Miss Carberry is facing a one day ban after she was accused of allowing her horse to canter into the start of the race.
