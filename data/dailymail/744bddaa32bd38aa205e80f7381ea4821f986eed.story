Featherweight champion Jose Aldo and challenger Conor McGregor stopped off in Las Vegas as part of the eight-city, five-country tour to promote their main event bout of UFC 189 at the MGM Grand Garden Arena in July.

Staying at the Red Rock Casino Resort and Spa, the pair took part in a video blog that gives some insight into their preparation for the fight being billed as one of the most significant the sport has ever seen. 

And McGregor said of his opponent at his news conference on Monday, 'Fear has a strong stench, and he is reeking of it.'

Aldo has held his title since 2010 when UFC merged with the old World Extreme Cagefighting organisation. As the fourth and final featherweight champion of WEC, he carried the belt across. 

Since then, Aldo has won his last seven UFC bouts in a row. Unfazed though, McGregor dismissed him as 'all talk' and 'just mouth.' 

He continued, 'I expect everyone in the top 10 of the featherweight division to line up and beg for forgiveness, beg to be pardoned!'
