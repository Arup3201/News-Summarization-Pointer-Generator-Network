Nick Bonnie, 30, sent a final text to his girlfriend Leah Wilkins telling her he loved her before dying of an Ecstasy overdose

A worker at Prince Charles's flagship charity sent a final text to his girlfriend telling her he loved her, just hours before dying of an Ecstasy overdose during a night out with friends.

Prince's Trust employee Nick Bonnie, 30, who had been pictured with the Prince of Wales and visited Highgrove and Buckingham Palace through his work, collapsed after taking the drug while on a ‘lads’ weekend’ in Manchester in September last year. 

Hours before, Mr Bonnie texted his girlfriend Leah Wilkins - who had no idea her boyfriend used drugs - saying, 'goodnight, love you'. He also posed for a photo with his friends while at the rave. 

But Mr Bonnie - whose mother works in drug rehabilitation - had unknowingly taken almost 15 times the recreational dose of MDMA while at the rave. 

Soon after, he had been rushed to hospital where he died two hours later.

Today, at an inquest into Mr Bonnie's death, the coroner blasted the 'morally bankrupt' dealers of party drugs as a 'heinous blot on our civilisation'. 

Speaking at the hearing in Stockport, John Pollard said: 'These drugs are manufactured and distributed by people who clearly have no care for the welfare of fellow human beings.

'They are morally bankrupt and form a heinous blot on our civilisation.'

The inquest heard how Mr Bonnie and three of his friends had bought Ecstasy and cocaine before leaving their hometown in Stroud, Gloucestershire, for the night out at the Warehouse Project.

The foursome took some MDMA and cocaine while travelling the 200 miles by car to Manchester.

They also took more while getting ready for the night out at a rented apartment in Salford, before taking more as they queued to enter the club.

After Mr Bonnie's death, the three friends and another member of the group were prosecuted for lying to police about where they bought the drug. 

Dean Neale, Paul Tabb, James Churchill and Simon Lloyd-Jones - who abstained from taking the drugs during the night - had agreed to lie to police about who had supplied the drugs.

The group concocted the story as they travelled in a taxi to Manchester Infirmary to visit Mr Bonnie, where he lay dying.

They claimed they bought the drugs in the club in a 'drunken mistake', leading to police putting out urgent alerts about a possible fatal ‘bad batch’ of drugs circulating the club.

Mr Bonnie's mother Pauline has previously hit out at how his friends’ lies had caused her family ‘additional anguish and unacceptable stress’ by prolonging their ordeal for more than a year.

Today, Mr Neale - who alongside his friends was given a suspended sentence for their crimes - told the hearing they had concocted the story to 'protect the image of us as a group'. 

Mr Tabb said the group made up the lie so Mr Bonnie's death would be 'easier' for his parents' to 'get their head around'.

The court heard Mr Bonnie, a finance manager, had taken drugs on previous occasions, unbeknownst to his girlfriend, parents and colleagues.

Mr Tabb said: 'I knew from previous conversations that they had no idea he had ever taken drugs.

'We thought it would be easier for them to get their head round it if they thought their son had made one drunken mistake.

'All of us were told we wouldn't get in any trouble for the drugs so we didn't do it to protect ourselves.'

Mr Lloyd-Jones described it as 'the worst mistake I have ever made'.

He added: 'We thought if they didn't say they took the drugs up with them then it would be a slap on the wrist and it wouldn't go any further.

'It only occurred after the lie that we should have told the truth.'

The court heard today how the group took the drugs before heading out, but ended up splitting up from one another when the DJ finished his set. 

After combing the club and checking in the toilets, Mr Neale told the inquest that one of the group went back to the apartment see if Mr Bonnie had gone home.

But Mr Bonnie was on his own in the venue and had been found by security manager Ivan Horsman, after crashing through a fire door.

Mr Horsman told the inquest: 'He seemed to lose his footing as he came out and fell to the floor flat on his back right in front of me.

'He said his name was Nick and I could tell he was not simply drunk and he had taken something. I noticed he was clammy to the touch.

'I tried to talk to him but he was now less responsive. I remember him saying, "I can cope, I can do it". Me and a colleague took an arm each and helped him to his feet.'

The worker then described how Mr Bonnie began spasming in their arms, before his speech began to deteriorate.

Dean Neale, Paul Tabb and James Churchill, pictured outside Stockport Coroner's Court, today told the court about why they had lied to police about where they bought the drugs from which killed Mr Bonnie 

He said: 'I could tell he was taking a turn for the worse. I kept saying "stay with me". I heard the medic say she was calling 999 and that was the last I heard until I received a phone call at 5.45am to say he was dead.'

The court heard how the friends' lies unravelled when Miss Wilkins analysed her boyfriend's phone almost two months after Mr Bonnie's death.

She discovered a string of texts and WhatsApp messages which revealed the group's intentions to buy drugs before the night out.   

In court, Churchill, 31, a a gym owner, admitted three charges of supplying controlled Class A drug MDMA, three counts of supplying cocaine and a charge of perverting the course of justice.

He was sentenced to 12 months in prison, suspended for 18 months and ordered to carry out 250 hours of unpaid work.

Tabb, 31, and father-of-one Neale, 30, admitted possession of MDMA, possession of cocaine and perverting the course of justice by providing a false witness statement.

They were sentenced to eight months, suspended for 18 months, and ordered to carry out 250 hours of unpaid work.

Construction site engineer  Lloyd-Jones, 29, admitted perverting the course of justice and was sentenced to eight months, suspended for 18 months, as well as 250 hours of unpaid work.

The coroner gave Mr Bonnie's cause of death as MDMA and cocaine toxicity.

Tests showed a concentration of 4.42mg of MDMA in his blood. Typical recreational use normally measuring just 0.3mg. He had also had amphetamine and alcohol in his system.

Recording a narrative verdict, Mr Pollard said: 'There was nothing to suggest the presence of drugs in his body was due to anything other than a voluntary act. No-one forced him.

'It was apparently for the "buzz" that he would get from them.

'I suspect that he either took too many tablets or more likely he took the powder form of the drugs and didn't know how much he was taking.

'Looking at all the facts it is very clear that while Nick had used drugs previously and that he was planning to use them again, he managed to keep this from his parents and partner. 

'If they had any knowledge about this I'm confident they would have brought considerable force to bear on him.'

Mr Bonnie had worked for the Prince's Trust for eight years and had attended one of the Queen's garden parties at Buckingham Palace.

He had helped many young people get into work and was raising thousands of pounds for good causes, the inquest heard.
