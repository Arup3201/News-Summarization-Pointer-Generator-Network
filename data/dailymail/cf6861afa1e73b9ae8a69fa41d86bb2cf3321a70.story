The violence sweeping the streets of Belfast is so serious that police reinforcements may be drafted in from mainland Britain.

Officers have been attacked by rioters for five nights in protest at Belfast council’s decision to limit the number of days the Union Flag is flown above city hall to 18. Previously it was displayed every day.

Police have been shot at and bombarded with a hail of missiles – including petrol bombs, fireworks and bricks. By yesterday, 62 officers had been injured and around 100 people arrested since the protests began in early December.

Most demonstrations have been peaceful, but it has been claimed that senior members of the paramilitary Ulster Volunteer Force are orchestrating the street violence by loyalists in East Belfast.

City Hall was picketed by hundreds of loyalists last night when the council met for the first time since its decision over flag days was made.

Ulster’s top policeman, Matt Baggott, has told Northern Ireland Secretary Theresa Villiers he will need ‘more resources’ if the disorder continues, MailOnline understands.

And intelligence sources have revealed that members of the Army’s Special Reconnaissance Regiment – a secretive unit established during the Troubles to run surveillance against republican and loyalist paramilitary groups – have been deployed to the area.

Mr Baggott insisted he did not need extra officers at present, but that maintaining a large police presence to deal with the violence would undermine his ability to tackle the terror threat from dissident republicanism.

‘It will eat into our ability to deal with what remains a very severe dissident threat, and their intent remains as strong as ever,’ he said.

If Mr Baggott requests help, he would have to inform the Association of Chief Police Officers, which would co-ordinate the deployment of officers from England and Wales.

The first designated flag day will be tomorrow, to celebrate the Duchess of Cambridge’s 31st birthday.

Last night the disorder erupted as around 250 demonstrators from East Belfast returned from the city centre past a volatile community interface at the republican Short Strand.

Police said a number of missiles were thrown at the protesters from the Short Strand area, where around 70 youths had gathered.

The trouble soon spiralled from there as police moved up the adjacent Newtownards Road to separate rival factions.

Officers were attacked with petrol bombs, paint bombs, fireworks and heavy masonry while rioters damaged vehicles with hatchets and sledge hammers.

Protesters constructed a barricade in the middle of the road and set it on fire.

Police also received reports of an attempted car hi-jacking in the nearby Templemore Avenue area and attempted lorry hi-jacking in the Albertbridge Road area.

Police deployed water cannon and five baton rounds were fired. Calm was restored around 10pm. Last night two males and two females were arrested in East Belfast for riot and public order offences.
