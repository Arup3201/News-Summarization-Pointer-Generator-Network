Stuart Hall groomed a girl at 12 and made her read him graphic passages from lovemaking manual the Joy of Sex in his BBC dressing room, one of his victims said today.

The woman, now 39, has tearfully told for the first time how the disgraced It's A Knockout presenter abused her and 'put his tongue in my mouth'.

Speaking about reading him excerpts from the book, called the 'gourmet guide to lovemaking', she said as an innocent 12-year-old she began to blush and became very upset because it was so sexually graphic.

Shame: Stuart Hall, 83, who was jailed for 15 months, asked a 12-year-old victim to read him the Joy of Sex in his BBC dressing room, the woman involved said today

It came as yesterday Hall, 83, was told he would serve barely two weeks in prison for each of the young girls he sexually abused.

The sentence prompted a wave of 
outrage and fury, with victims saying it made a mockery of 
their horrific ordeal and politicians and campaigners condemning it as 
'incredibly lenient'.

He was jailed for 15 months after admitting that he indecently assaulted 13 girls between 
1967 and 1986. His youngest victim was nine.

Hall targeted the new victim who spoke out today how she was invited to the BBC Manchester studios with a friend after he approached them at a petrol station.

At the time he presented North West Tonight and told staff the girls were his 'nieces' and he was giving them elocution lessons - a way he managed to target children and young girls over several decades.

Two years after he had forced her read him the graphic sex manual, Hall targeted her again on the set of Children in Need,  when she was 14, and began feeding her champagne.

'Then he kissed me on the lips and put his tongue in my mouth. It was gross. I felt sick afterwards,' she told The Sun.

Hall then turned up a again a year 
later when she finished her exams at school and gave her and friends a 
lift home, and then tried to encourage them to come home with him.

'We
 were going to turn 16 and he kept telling us to come and see him when 
we did. Obviously we didn't. Looking back it was all part of the 
grooming process.'

The BBC said yesterday it was 'appalled that 
some of Stuart Hall's crimes took place in connection with his work at 
the BBC and offers an unreserved apology to the people he abused'.

Under sentencing rules Hall will be 
released automatically after serving just half the term and the Attorney
 General has already been forced to agree to review the sentence after 
being inundated with complaints.

He was last night examining whether it was 'unduly lenient' and should be referred back to the Court of Appeal.

Guilty: The former It's A Knockout presenter initially denied the charges and told police his victims were lying before pleading guilty

Politicians
 and child protection charities were among those who condemned the 
former BBC presenter's sentence, saying it sent the wrong message to 
victims of historic sex abuse following the Jimmy Savile scandal.

When
 Hall was first arrested last December, he told police his victims were 
all lying as part of a 'vendetta going on against people in the public 
eye'.

But the publicity 
led to more women coming forward, and in April the married father of two
 finally admitted 14 counts of indecent assault. The pleas could only be
 revealed last month, after reporting restrictions were lifted.

Last
 night two of the women who helped bring the predator to justice led the
 condemnation of his sentence. The pair waived their legal right to 
anonymity in the Daily Mail last month.

Susan
 Harrison was 16 when Hall lured her to BBC premises on the false 
pretext of helping her record a song, before attacking her in his car.

Mrs
 Harrison, now 61, said: 'His victims deserved more. I hope that he has 
an uncomfortable time in prison and reflects on the gravity of what he 
did.

'I feel that the sentence should have been higher especially taking into account the age of some of his victims.'

The mother of one added: 'His lenient 
sentence will not act as deterrent to others who go on to sexually abuse
 youngsters. I am pretty shocked by it and feel that he has almost 
walked free and it has made a mockery of what the victims have been 
through.

'This is after all his denials and 
calling us all liars and the claims spurious, callous and cruel – he has
 never personally apologised for what he has done and he is not 
remorseful.'

Kim Wright was 17 when Hall fondled 
her breasts at a show in Blackpool.

Now 55, she told the Mail: 'When he 
made those comments outside court about our allegations being false I 
felt like I had been abused all over again. He does not appear to be 
remorseful at all.'

Another of Hall's victims, who was also 17 when he molested her, told ITV News that 'justice has not been done'.

The woman, identified only as Amy, 
added: 'It's a mockery. It's not helping any future cases at all. It's 
not helping the victims. It's just giving people like Stuart Hall a slap
 on the wrist.'
