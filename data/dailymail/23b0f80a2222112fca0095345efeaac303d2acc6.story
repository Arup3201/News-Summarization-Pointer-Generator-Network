When Jason Alexander started boarding school in September he weighed a massive 23st. By the time he had returned for Christmas he had slimmed down to just over 16st, losing 93lbs over four months.

The astonishing weight-loss came after the 16-year-old spent a term at a special slimming school in South Carolina.

The MindStream Academy in Bluffton is the latest weapon in the fight against childhood obesity in the U.S. Each semester features exercising, studying, working with 
counsellors and learning how to cook healthy meals. Their slogan is 'Where Teens Fit.'

Last term Jason's Missouri school district sent 12 students there - the youngest of whom was 11. Together they lost a combined weight of 54st.

Each student had a sad story of how the 
pounds had piled on. Jason’s weight shot up after his father’s death when he was nine, jeopardising his dream of joining the military. Like many
who are overweight, he became easily winded and his knees hurt.

He said he’s now 40 pounds from 
being able to qualify military service and plans to join a training 
group to help him shed the rest of the weight.

Relatives and friends said the school had given the children confidence.

Jason’s mother, Debbie Alexander, 
said her son who had battled a speech impediment and been slow to smile 
was now grinning broadly.

'I feel amazing,' Jason agreed.

Jason shed 
weight so quickly that he struggled to find clothes. His jeans, which he
bought from another classmate, hung loose around him, cinched with a 
belt to keep them from falling off.

'I can’t believe I got to that 
point. I can’t believe I got that big,' he said.

The district envisions Jason and the 
other participants becoming health ambassadors in their schools, perhaps
speaking to groups or working one-on-one with classmates who are 
struggling with their weight.

Experts say it’s hard for 
anyone to maintain weight-loss if their families don’t also develop good
eating and exercise habits. So while the children were away their parents met 
monthly with MindStream’s clinical director in Independence to learn how
to help their children upon their return.

Jason's family have cleansed 
the kitchen of junk food, made space for a treadmill and stocked up on 
healthy items like ground turkey to help him continue his diet.

The school district, its foundation and the students’ families worked together to pay about half of the usual $28,500-per-semester (£17,500) tuition at the academy. The rest was paid by a foundation associated with the academy and other donors.

Sarah Stone, the director of programming at MindStream, said it hopes to engage other school districts in similar partnerships in the future.

'It is to all of our best interest for these kids to be able to realize their best potential,' she said.
