PATENTLY A WIN FOR RODGERS

Chelsea manager Jose Mourinho usually looks sharp in a suit on the touchline but he has a different look for cup competitions and prefers to wear his tracksuit. Last night was no different. Liverpool manager Brendan Rodgers took it in the style stakes, wearing patent shoes with his suit and that new scarf of his tied neatly around his neck.

Rodgers 1, Mourinho 0.

STEVIE HOUNDED FOR SLIP

You would like to think that Steven Gerrard’s long farewell to English football would be respected by opposition supporters. Not a bit of it — and certainly not at Stamford Bridge on Tuesday night. Instead, with every touch of the ball, the Liverpool captain was treated to the ‘Demba Ba’ chant, a reference to last season’s slip at Anfield. Ouch.

SALAH AND SCHURRLE ABSENT 

No sign of Mohammed Salah or Andre Schurrle in the 18 for Chelsea, which did nothing to change the feeling that they occupy Jose’s ejector seats, the first to make way should the club crack a deal to sign Juan Cuadrado or Douglas Costa this month. There was a place on the bench, however, for Nathan Ake, as cover in defensive midfield with John Obi Mikel suffering from the head injury which forced him off against Bradford.

STURRIDGE GOES HOME ALONE 

Daniel Sturridge, who travelled to the capital with the Liverpool squad, returned north before kick off. Manager Brendan Rodgers wanted to keep him close so key medical personnel could monitor his recovery from a thigh injury. The striker spent time with his family in London before heading back to be fresh when he reports for full training on Wednesday.
