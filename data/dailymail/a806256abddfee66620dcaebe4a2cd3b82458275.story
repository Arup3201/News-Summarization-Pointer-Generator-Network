Monica Lewinsky has told a Norwegian conference that she became the world's first cyberbullying victim after her affair with Bill Clinton was exposed.

The 41-year-old said she believes the rising popularity of Google in the same year that the affair came to light led to her life being destroyed by online trolls in a way others had not experienced.

She told a crowd at the Marie Høeg Conference that she went from being an anonymous person to being 'humiliated worldwide' in just 24 hours.

'What happened to me was that I lost my entire reputation,' she told The Local. 

'I lost myself and the whole world was given a picture of me that I did not recognise at all.

'There is immeasurable humiliation. It is the feeling that the whole world is laughing at you. I just thought I would die.' 

Ms Lewinsky's comments were made a week before she is due to give a TED talk on cyberbullying.

The former White House intern shot to fame when her affair with Clinton was uncovered in 1998. 

Clinton, then 49, initially denied their relationship but Ms Lewinsky, then 22, confirmed it had been sexual.

While Clinton, who was president from 1993 to 2001, was fined for giving a false testimony Ms Lewinsky became a household name – and the butt of countless late-night jokes.

A decade later she penned an explosive tell-all article for Vanity Fair about the Clinton scandal, describing her relationship with the married president as 'consensual'. 

She also spoke at the Forbes Under 30 Summit in October last year where she told the crowd: 'Sixteen years ago, fresh out of college I fell in love with my boss.  

Ms Lewinsky was just 22 when she and then-President Bill Clinton began an affair that would deeply affect both of their futures. Picture taken in November 1995

'I [then] lost my public self, or had it stolen. Of course, it was all done on the excruciatingly slow dial up. Yet around the world this story went.

'It was a viral phenomenon that, you could argue, was the first moment of truly "social media."' 

Ms Lewinsky said she was inspired to speak out after a gay student at Rutgers University committed suicide days after his roommate secretly filmed him kissing another man.

She is hoping that publicizing her story will lead to people thinking twice about humiliating and trolling others online.

Clinton famously said he 'did not have sexual relations' with Ms Lewinsky when she claimed they had had relations nine times between 1995 and 1997. Above, the pair are pictured greeting each other at a White House lawn party in November 1996
