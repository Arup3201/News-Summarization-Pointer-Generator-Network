They drink champagne with breakfast, have liposuction in lieu of dieting and think nothing of spending £86,000 on an impulse bought Range Rover.

Meet the UK's flashiest families, for whom life is all about spending their hard-earned cash on just about anything that takes their fancy.

Designer shopping sprees, doggy wardrobes that cost £10,000 a year to maintain and expensive boys toys such as diggers and jetskis are all among their favourite purchases - and they couldn't care less if people think their lavish lifestyles are tacky.

Big spenders: Robin and Noelie Goforth spend their millions on yachts, clothes and cosmetic surgery

One such family is Doncaster couple Robin and Noelie Goforth who made their millions from a series of businesses selling everything from cars to property and even leather coats.

Mr Goforth, who is now retired, made his first million aged 35 and now spends his days relaxing with a glass of champagne beside his own private fishing lake.

Wife Noelie still works, albeit running one of her husband's fisheries, and when she's not doing that, spends her time indulging in lavish shopping sprees or splashing out 'the cost of a couple of cars' on cosmetic nips and tucks.

'Nobody's given it to us, we're not lottery winners,' she insists. 'I get up every day and I work.'

Nevertheless, she's happy to admit that she loves spending money and says her wardrobe of designer clothes includes many that she's never worn. 

'I don't want to be the richest woman in the graveyard,' adds the blonde, who describes her look as being 'like a Russian hooker. 'I just want to spend it and enjoy it.'

Someone who would agree wholeheartedly with that assessment is Lizzie Cundy, the WAG turned gossip column fodder, who with Noelie and Robin, appears in a Channel 5 documentary entitled Britain's Flashiest Families.

In it, she is seen enjoying a shopping trip in which she spends the equivalent of £131 a minute, all while gushing about her celebrity lifestyle - and her A-list friends. 

'It's easier to say who isn't a friend,' she boasts. 'Eva Longoria was a friend and I'm friends with Alex Gerrard [the blonde wife of Liverpool footballer Steven Gerrard].

'Mickey Rourke I'd class as a friend. Tom Cruise is another.'

But while she enjoys hobnobbing with the stars, what Cundy really loves is spending and she says her red carpet lifestyle is the reason for her splurges. 

'I love the red carpet lifestyle,' she explains. 'People say, "Oh that girl, she'd go to the opening of an envelope". I'd go to the opening of a Tampax box! Yes, I do love a free event.'

This means dresses - and lots of them. 'I probably have to get three designer dresses a week, just because I'm going to three events a week and I have to look good,' she says.

Another fan of a designer shopping spree is Leanne Couch, a mother-of-four from Newport in Wales.

But the beneficiary of her luxury spending habits isn't one of her children or even herself. Instead, her earnings are lavished on her bichon frise dog Lucy, who owns a vast wardrobe of designer clothes, as well as five different dog beds.

'I don't spend any money on the kids,' she explains. 'But Lucy will get something new every week. There are still things with tags on in her wardrobe.' 

In total, Ms Couch spends around £10,000 a year on her pet pooch and has a shopping list that includes beauty treatments, designer clothes and dog nappies that cost £40 a pop.

'She's had some amazing bling items over the years,' says Lucy's besotted owner. 'I love bling, I always have done and so does Lucy. A pearl lead - gorgeous!'

A penchant for bling is something she shares with both Cundy and the Goforths, all of whom revel in splashing out on anything that shimmers, sparkles or shines.

Cundy is seen casually buying a gold sequinned dress for £4,800 before swanning off to choose a new car - an £86,000 top-of-the-range Range Rover that comes complete with a mini fridge for her lipgloss collection.

Mrs Goforth, meanwhile, spends her spare cash on designer labels - and lots of them. 'I spend my pocket money on designer labels,' she beams.

'I wouldn't say I live for them but I near enough live for them. I like shoes, the Louboutins, I like Chanel bags. I love Chanel, I love Dolce & Gabbana, I love Versace.'

She also loves cosmetic surgery and has spent thousands on keeping her looks in tip top condition. 

'One of my great loves in life is cosmetic surgery,' she gleefully admits. 'It is important to keep looking nice and look nice for my husband.

'I've got friends who have put on weight and then you think, "Why are you surprised that your husband left you?"'

But staying trim isn't always easy for Mrs Goforth who cheerfully reveals that she can't be bothered to diet.

Instead, she shifts the excess pounds with a casually purchased bit of liposuction. 'I'm having lipo because I'm throwing a dinner and I've got a new dress to fit into,' she explains.

'What's a girl got to do? I don't have time to diet.'

Needless to say, this doesn't come cheap. 'I could not put a price on how much my husband has spent on my cosmetic improvements,' she confesses.

'It's been a few quid... You could buy a couple of cars with what I've spent at least.'

Happily for husband Robin, there are some compensations, not least the £375,000 yacht he has just snapped up for the couple to enjoy. 

'We've got the house, the land, the fabulous businesses and the supercars,' he beams. 'The yacht is the icing on the cake.'
