A night of boxing descended into violence this weekend when the supporters of rival boxers stormed the ring and began throwing punches of their own.

Security was overrun as supporters of Sheffield super bantamweight fighters Uzair 'The Nightmare' Najib and Muheeb 'Flashy' Fazeldin brawled inside the squared circle.

The bedlam continued on the canvas even with the ring announcer screaming for calm and warning that the contest would be disqualified if peace was not restored at the Octagon Theatre in Sheffield, South Yorkshire.

Brawl: Supporters of Uzair 'The Nightmare' Najib and Muheeb 'Flashy' Fazeldin brawl inside the boxing ring at an event hosted at the Octagon Theatre in Sheffield, South Yorkshire, on Saturday night

Unseemly: The bedlam began seconds after Najid's defeat and continued on even with the ring announcer screaming for calm and warning that the contest would be disqualified if peace was not restored

Violence broke out moments after Fazeldin stopped Najib in the first round of their fight for the Central Arena title.

There was animosity between the fighters ahead of Saturday night's event, which was headlined by Ross Burkinshaw, who KO’d Belgian Benjamin Smoes, also in the first round, for a European title.

That bad blood exploded into violence seconds after Najib's quick defeat, with the fighter going down just one second before the end of the first round.

'The disgraceful scenes went on for only a couple of minutes, but they brought shame on an otherwise superb night of boxing,' reported the Sheffield Telegraph.

Answering a question posed by Mike Tyson's official Twitter account about a video circulating online of the brawl, Najib said it was 'just over-passionate fans who got a bit crazy.'

'[B]een receiving lots of apologies and hope my boxing journey hasn't been halted,' he added.
