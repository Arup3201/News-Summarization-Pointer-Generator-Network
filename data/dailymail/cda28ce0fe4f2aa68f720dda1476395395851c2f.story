In his lifetime, Steve Jobs was roundly criticized for seemingly not donating enough money to philanthropic causes.

However, it has been revealed recently that the late founder of Apple and his wife - both intensely private individuals - quietly made large donations to charity.

Jobs never addressed his philanthropic endeavors and 
refused to discuss the subject even with his biographer, Walter 
Isaacson. But now, his widow, Laurene Powell Jobs, has publicly spoken out about  her charitable work.

Intensely private: Laurene Powell Jobs, founder and chair of Emerson Collective and widow of the late Apple founder Steve Jobs, designed her organization in a way that allows her to make donations anonymously

Also, it has surfaced recently that 
the founder of Apple Inc. donated $50million of his own money to 
hospitals in California and funded HIV and AIDS research.

'We're really careful about 
amplifying the great work of others in every way that we can, and we 
don't like attaching our names to things,' Laurene Powell Jobs said in 
an interview to the New York Times.

Steve Jobs' widow has founded Emerson Collective LLC, which is structured on the model of a small business, allowing the organization to make anonymous donations to various causes, from grants to political campaigns.

Powell Jobs has been actively backing College Track, the college preparatory organization she co-founded in 1997.

'I’ve always appreciated that being the wife of Steve Jobs, she could have played that as much as possible, but she doesn’t,' said Marshall Lott, who has worked at College Track.

Jobs' attitude toward philanthropy stood in sharp contrast to that of other billionaires, most of them only too happy to draw the public's attention to their commitment to philanthropy.

Speaking out: U2 lead singer and humanitarian Bono, who was friends with Jobs, wrote an op-ed insisting that his contributions to the fight against AIDS in Africa were 'invaluable'

In 2011, Steve Jobs found himself in the middle of a controversy following the publication of a New York Times article, which claimed that there was no public record of the Apple founder giving money to charity.

In response, U2 lead singer and humanitarian Bono, who was friends with Jobs, wrote an op-ed insisting that Jobs' contributions to the fight against AIDS in Africa were 'invaluable,' according to Apple Insider. 

The musician revealed that Apple, which has been supporting his (Product)RED charity, also has been the chief financial backer of the Global Fund to Fight AIDS, adding that the tech giant has given millions of dollars toward HIV research.

Last year, Jobs' successor, Tim Cook, said that his late boss gave $50million to Stanford hospitals, which went towards building a children's medical center and a new main building.

Jobs also declined an invitation to join The Giving Pledge campaign spearheaded by Microsoft founder Bill Gates and Warren Buffet, which encourages the one-percenters to give away most of their wealth to charity in their lifetime.
