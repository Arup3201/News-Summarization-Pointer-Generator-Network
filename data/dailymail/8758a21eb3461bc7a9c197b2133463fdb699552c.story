A nephew who was branded an 'ostentatious spendthrift' by his uncle will inherit his £800,000 Cornwall home - despite the elderly relative leaving a will to the contrary.

Before he died, aged 90, retired art historian, William 'Bill' Taylor, said his nephew Roger Taylor was 'the last person' he wanted to have Lower Manaton Farm, his grade-II listed long house in Callington.

The widower was adamant that his nephew would 'blow all the money' if he got his hands on it and that he wanted to leave £650,000 to charity - but now his wishes have finally been thwarted by an Appeal Court ruling.

Dispute: Roger Taylor won his legal battle to get the £800,000 home, despite his uncle's wishes

To the fury of other members of the family and charities that would otherwise have benefited, the court held Mr Taylor to a 'bargain' he made before he died and declared his nephew and his partner, Denise Burkinshaw, the rightful owners of Lower Manaton Farm.

It was the disappearance of Mr Taylor’s beloved Etesia lawn mower from an outhouse after his wife’s death that made him realise he should not be alone and he invited his nephew, Miss Burkinshaw and their two children to move down from their Sheffield home to live with him.

The couple set up home in the farmhouse’s east wing, while Mr Taylor stayed in the west wing, but by the time Mr Taylor died in 2010 they were dragging each other through the courts.

The nephew and his family were 
adamant that Mr Taylor had promised to leave them his home in return for
uprooting themselves from their home in Sheffield and moving south to care for him.

However, the pensioner insisted the 
only deal he ever struck with the couple was that they could live in the
house rent-free if they contributed towards the bills. To the day he died, he insisted he would be entirely within his rights to throw them out.

In
August last year, a year after Mr Taylor died, Judge Jeremy Griggs 
accepted the couple’s plea that an agreement had been struck by the 
uncle and awarded them the whole of Lower Manaton Farm, subject to inheritance tax.

That was despite a witness statement signed by Mr Taylor the month before he died in which he insisted:'Roger would be the last person that I would leave the house to. There was never any intention of leaving my house to him, or anyone else.'

The house made up the vast bulk of Mr Taylor’s estate - valued at over £1m - and the judge’s ruling meant that charities, his great-granddaughter, Isobel Constantine, and his niece and her husband all lost out.

Judge Griggs’ ruling came under fire at the Court of Appeal where the executors of Mr Taylor’s estate, including his niece Gabrielle Bradbury and her husband Peter, argued that he got it wrong and was far too generous to Roger Taylor and Miss Burkinshaw.

Leslie Blohm QC, for the executors, said the relationship between Bill Taylor and his nephew was 'not easy' even before the widower decided to share his home.

Mr Taylor had 'bankrupted' his nephew over an unpaid loan in the 1960s and the evidence was that he regarded the younger man as 'a spendthrift, ostentatious and a risky proposition'.

The court heard trouble brewed in 2009 when the couple discovered Mr Taylor had no intention of leaving them the house. They went to court, claiming the old man had promised it to them, although he 'vehemently denied' ever having done anything of the sort.

The elder Mr Taylor even sought an injunction against the couple, seeking access for himself and his carers to guest rooms and the house’s laundry room.

In his ruling, Judge Griggs accepted Denise Burkinshaw’s account that she had only reluctantly agreed to abandon Sheffield for Cornwall and would never have done so had Mr Taylor not assured her that she and her husband would inherit the house.

The couple had helped the old man empty his bins, get his car in and out of his garage and put his laundry into the washing machine and, although that 'did not amount to a great deal', the judge said it sealed the 'bargain' they had reached with Mr Taylor.

In his final will, signed in 2009, Mr Taylor tried to leave £650,000 - more than half his estate - to charity.

He directed that the rest of his his estate be split into 100 equal parts, with 55 of them going to his great granddaughter, Ms Constantine, 15 of them to Mr and Mrs Bradbury and the remaining 30 to Roger Taylor and Miss Burkinshaw - but only on condition that they moved out of the house within six months of his death.

However, the pensioner’s plans were defeated by Judge Griggs’ ruling, with the asset that made up almost 80% of his estate going to the couple with whom he was engaged in a bitter legal dispute until he died.

Had Mr Taylor’s will been observed, there would have been no inheritance tax liability on his estate but the court heard Judge Griggs’ ruling saddled the estate with a tax bill for almost £160,000.
