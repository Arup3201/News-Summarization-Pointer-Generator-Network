A mother desperate for a lung transplant has said she would gladly accept the organs of a smoker  rather than die on the transplant list.

Robyn Davidson suffers from cystic fibrosis and has been warned by her doctors she needs a transplant in order to survive.

One in three people waiting for new lungs die on the transplant list and she has already been waiting five months.

Robyn, who has two young daughters, told ITV's This Morning: 'Yes, transplants are risky, but the biggest risk for me is not getting any lungs at all.

'Anything that I can do to increase the chance, I am prepared to do. I am the mother of two daughters and I want to be here for them.'

'For me, the risk of getting lung cancer from a smoker's lungs in one, 10, 20 years time is very small - compared to the risk that I won't get new lungs at all.

'It's absolutely an option I am willing to take.'

Last week the Cystic Fibrosis Trust called for smokers' lungs to be made more widely available to transplant patients.

The
 current rules are that a donor should not have smoked more than a pack a
 day for 20 years. Anyone who has smoked more than this is classed as a 
marginal donor.

But doctors are warning that many lungs that could be used for people like Robyn are being thrown away.

Discovery: Transplant patients who are given 
smokers' lungs (right) are just as likely to survive as those who 
receive organs from non-smokers (left), a study has revealed. Some 
patients even had higher survival rates

Last month it was revealed that one in five lung transplant patients are given organs from 20-a-day smokers.

In fact, almost a half of donated lungs come from someone who had smoked, according to a major  British study.

Despite
 this, the researchers said patients' survival rate was not harmed by 
receiving a smoker's lungs and the research should ease patients' fears 
about donors who had smoked.

Robyn said: 'I have had to start thinking about if I don't get a transplant. I have started writing letters I can leave for my daughters if the worst happens'

The
 study showed that patients who received lungs from non-smokers actually
 had a slightly lower one-year survival rate. The research was carried 
out at Harefield Hospital in north-west London.

Robyn's
 condition is now at the stage where she needs an hour of physiotherapy 
every day and an hour using a nebuliser (to deliver medication).

She told hosts Philip Scofield and Holly Willoughby: 'I have good days and bad days, but I am progressively getting worse.

Cystic fibrosis is a genetic condition which causes the lungs and the digestive system to become clogged with mucus.

Symptoms usually appear in early childhood and they include a persistent cough, recurring chest infections and failure to thrive.

As the condition develops, a lung transplant may be required.

There is no cure for cystic fibrosis so treatment revolves around relieving symptoms and reducing long-term damage caused by infections.

The most common treatments are physiotherapy to clear the mucus from the lungs, and antibiotics to treat the infections.

The condition is caused by a genetic mutation which allows too much salt and water into cells - this results in a build-up of mucus.

For a child to inherit the condition, both of their parents have to be carriers of the mutated gene.

In this situation, there is a one in four chance the child will not inherit either of the faulty genes, a one in two chance they will inherit one of them and be a carrier but not a sufferer, and a one in four chance they will inherit both genes and suffer from the condition.

About one in every 2,500 babies born in the UK are born with cystic fibrosis.

As treatments have improved, the outlook for these children has improved dramatically.

Life expectancy remains in the 40s.

'I
 have had to start thinking about if I don't get a transplant. I have 
started writing letters I can leave for my daughters if the worst 
happens.

'They are obviously aware of my condition and try and help me.'

In
 2012, 188 lung transplants were carried out. Yet at any one time there 
are about 240 people waiting for such an operation. Recent developments 
in techniques, sometimes dubbed ‘washing’, mean that today just over a 
third of lung transplants come from patients who smoked.

Doctors
 believe that if rules were relaxed further, up to 100 more lungs a year
 would become available. These would be from groups designated 
‘sub-optimal’ – not considered good enough to donate

Campaigners
 also want the rules regarding age limits for donors erased, and for 
lungs from those with pre-existing medical conditions such as asthma, 
diabetes and even hepatitis to be considered viable.

‘Common sense suggests that lungs from a donor who smoked can’t be very healthy, but studies have shown that three-year survival rates following a lung transplant are unaffected by whether or not the donor was a smoker,’ says Andrew Fisher, Professor of Respiratory Transplant Medicine at Newcastle University.

Some risk continues to exist, such as development of lung cancer in the donor lung of a smoker. Tiny cancers are not visible on inspection so there is a small chance that such a cancer could be transplanted with the donor lung. But this is a very rare occurrence.’

The average survival after a lung transplant is six years. ‘It is more important to get a transplant performed than worry about potential risks that may or may not happen 15 years later,’ adds Professor Fisher.

Fears were raised two years ago after the shock lung cancer death of Jennifer Wederell, a 27-year-old CF patient.

Sixteen months earlier she had undergone a lung transplant – she later found out that the donor had smoked 20 cigarettes a day throughout their life.
