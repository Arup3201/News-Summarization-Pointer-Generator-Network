First lady Michelle Obama’s next healthy eating campaign seeks to motivate kids to eat their vegetables is missing the music industry A-listers often seen with the first family.

Her Let’s Move! program has partnered with names like Dr. Oz, Jordin Sparks, and Doug E. Fresh on 19 songs directed at children and teens at risk for obesity, but is curiously missing the likes of Common, Jay Z, P Diddy and others that have spent time at the White House.

Some of the artists featured on the album include Doug E. Fresh, Travis Barker and Monifah, as well as one of the New York Knicks.

The surprising lack of star power paved the way for Knicks Guard Iman Shumpert to spit a few lines on one of the songs, according to the New York Post. A cameo is also made by DMC, of the duo Run DMC, but that's where the notoriety ends.

The group also plans to produce ten 
music videos from its album Songs for a Healthier America--which have 
titles like U R What You Eat and Veggie Luv. The album is due out 
September 2013.

Singers such as Ashanti and Jordin Sparks make appearances, as well as Dr. Oz - yes, he's rapping, or at least trying to - but one can't help wonder if Jay Z sent the call about this project straight to voice mail.

This move is yet another in the first 
lady’s campaign against childhood obesity, a condition that affects 
African American children disproportionately to whites.

It is estimated that 50 percent of African American youths are obese.

‘I think hip-hop in particular – so many kids love hip-hop. It's such a core part of our culture,’ Let's Move! Executive Director and White House assistant chef Sam Kass told U.S. News. ‘And particularly in the African-American community and the Latino community which is being disproportionately affected by those health issues.’

'It's your body, tell somebody': Called 'Everybody,' the video features Jordin Sparks among other big names singing about healthy eating and Let's Move! hopes to release nine more videos once the album is out September 30

Star studded: The video came out in June and features TV personality Dr. Oz singing about eating right along with Jordin Sparks, Fresh E. Fresh and other performers

The White House’s program was first inspired by the efforts of Hip Hop Public Health, which began in 2005.

‘[We] started looking at the communities with obesity in New York, and a lot of these communities just happened to be poor communities, and happened to be African-American, Hispanic, Latino,’ said the group’s founder Olajide Williams. ‘We needed to develop an interventionary tool for the community. Hip-hop was born as a platform to bring our interventions to the youth.’

Then, this past June, the first video from the collaboration was released. Called ‘Everybody,’ the song features the music stylings of Jordin Sparks, Doug E. Fresh, and others, along with cameos in the video from Dr. Oz and Michelle Obama herself.

In the first song out from the first lady Michelle Obama's Let's Move! campaign's hip hop album, TV medical personality and Oprah Winfrey scion Dr. Oz raps with Hip Hop MD. On his latex-gloved hand, Dr. Oz wears several big gold rings. He also wears a bejeweled stethoscope around his neck.

They sing:

You gotta watch your calories, what you're taking in.

Now, to balance out your calories you gotta hit the gym.

Never thought a cardiac surgeonAnd a neurologist.

Will talk exercise,Not politics.

You only got one life to live. Live healthy, that's what it is!LET'S GO!

For his cameo, Dr. Oz sports a jewel-encrusted stethescope and raps alongside a sort of hip hop parallel to himself, Hip Hop MD.

In her appearance, Obama recalls the first days of her Let’s Move program when people wondered if they could really make a difference in childhood obesity. Now, as the group prepares to release what is likely to be its most visible campaign yet, FLOTUS may be about to find out.

Once the videos are complete, Obama and her collaborators intend to distribute them to schools first in New York City and then in Washington, DC, San Antonio, and Philadelphia with the hope they'll be played during recess or between periods.

For his part, Kass believes Songs for a Healthier America is going to be a winner, thanks in no small part to the way they’ve chosen to reach out.

‘Cultural leaders and visionaries in our country can give these messages to kids in a way that's not preachy,’ he said. ‘Kids are going to be dancing and listening to the music.’
