A picture of Ciaran Goggins wearing a t-shirt with an image of Ched Evans and the words '100 per cent innocent' appeared on the Justice for Ched site

A 'true friend' of Ched Evans who has worked 'closely' with the campaign to clear his name has made abusive comments about his victim and posted a link to the website that named her.

Ciaran Goggins made derogatory comments and allegations about the convicted rapist's victim, describing her as a 'false rape accuser' who was unhappy as she did not get a 'big win' and a pink MINI.

He was arrested after tweeting a link to the website which named the disgraced footballer's victim – despite the fact that she is legally entitled to lifelong anonymity.

The Twitter troll has long been a supporter of the Justice for Ched campaign and insisted that the former Sheffield United striker's two-and-a-half year jail term was a miscarriage of justice.

A picture of Goggins wearing a T-shirt bearing the logo 'Ched Evans is innocent' was displayed on the campaign site with the caption: 'a True Friend and Supporter'.

But the site has now distanced itself from Goggins, saying his comments were 'unreasonable and unpalatable' and subsequently removing his image from the site.

In one blog post in October last year, Goggins wrote: 'It seems that the false rape accuser of Ched Evans is unhappy. She did not get much of a 'big win' and no Pink Mini either.

'What she did get was a relocation package by the North Wales police vermin paid for by the UK taxpayer.'

Evans was released from prison last year after being found guilty of raping a drunk woman in a hotel in Wales in 2011, but he has continued to maintain his innocence.

The former Sheffield United striker finally issued an apology to his victim earlier this month and condemned the online abuse that has been aimed at her ever since his conviction in April 2012.

'It has been claimed that those using social media in an abusive and vindictive way towards this woman are supporters of mine,' the statement said.

'I wish to make it clear that these people are not my supporters and I condemn their actions entirely.'

Goggins took to his blog yesterday and wrote: 'After years of working closely together I am now leaving the 'Justice for Ched' campaign to concentrate on other issues.

'Ched Evans was subject of a miscarriage of justice - I feel that with his new legal team under Shaun Draycott he will be exonerated.'

In 2012 Goggins, who is a resident in Ireland, was one of 19 people arrested and questioned by North Wales police on suspicion of naming Evans's victim on social media.

Ten were subsequently charged and convicted, including Gemma Thomas, Evans' cousin.

No charges were brought against Goggins, but The Guardian reported that he was questioned for 72 hours and his ex-girlfriend's computer and his UK and Ireland mobile phones were seized.

He was released without charge.

A spokesman for the Justice for Ched site said Goggins was a 'vocal' supporter of Evans' claim to have been wrongly convicted, and they only 'very recently' became aware of his social media comments.

'Up until we were aware of his derogatory comments last week, we viewed him as a conscientious supporter of Ched,' a spokesman said.

'When we understood some of the tweets were totally unreasonable and unpalatable his image was removed from the site.

'To be clear we have now cut all communication with Ciaran Goggins or anyone who purports to be Ciaran Goggins and will not interact with anyone who uses social media to attack anyone.

'Ched does not in any way support the negative use of social media by anyone whether they claim to be his friends or supporters or not.' 

The website itself,  has set out a partial account of Evans’s trial, is currently under investigation by the Attorney General, whose office is considering whether it is in contempt of court.

Evans could face  a further 14 months out of football if he continues his fight to clear his name.

A deal for the disgraced footballer l to sign for Oldham Athletic collapsed at the last minute earlier this month.

This is the fourth club to turn down the chance to sign the former Wales and Sheffield United striker after his release from jail last October, halfway through a five-year sentence.

Goggins has also written abusive comments about Jean Hatchett, who was behind the online petition to stop the 26-year-old returning to his former club, which collected more than 160,000 signatures.
