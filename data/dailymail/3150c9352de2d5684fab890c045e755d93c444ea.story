Two high school students have been suspended after posting a photo of themselves posing with replica guns online just hours before their homecoming dance.

Tito Velez and his girlfriend Jamie Pereira, both 16, decided to pose with 'unique props' ahead of the event at Bristol-Plymouth Regional Technical School in Taunton, Massachusetts.

Donning formal attire, they picked up two Airsoft guns - replica firearms that look deadly, but can shoot only plastic pellets - and took a picture.

They later posted the image on Facebook, where it was viewed by hundreds of fellow students, leading to 'significant disruption' the next day at school, according to officials.

Now, Mr Velez and Miss Pereira have been suspended for up to 10 days pending a hearing as to when or whether they will be allowed to return.

Defending his decision to take the  photo, Mr Velez, who regularly participates in Airsoft team games as a hobby, told WCVB: 'We wanted something unique and different instead of using flowers like everyone else. We were like, "let’s use something we like to do on the weekend as a prop".'

Pointing to one of the replica rifles, he added: 'This isn’t dangerous, you can’t kill someone with it. We didn’t shoot anyone, we were pointing them at the floor.'

Controversy: The students (pictured speaking to TV crews) decided to pose with the Airsoft guns - which can shoot only plastic pellets - ahead of the event at Bristol-Plymouth Regional Technical School in Taunton

Miss Pereira toldCBS Boston she understand why school officials had expressed concern over the image, but said: 'I think they took this way too far. Suspending us for 10 days and possible expulsion is way too much.'

The students, who posted the photo online last Friday, were pulled out of school on Monday as they headed to a track meet for long-distance runners. They were then quizzed by police officers.

Miss Pereira's father, Jailes, said the school's reaction to the image was 'ridiculous' and blown out of proportion, adding that it went against the couple's freedom of speech at a 'private house'.

But defending his decision to suspend the students, Superintendent Richard Gross said: 'It has nothing to do with free speech. Their behavior caused a significant disruption in the school' 

'We had our homecoming event on Friday and following that the students were looking at Facebook and, of course, it caused a tumult in the building.'

He added that the photo had been uploaded to an online album titled 'Homecoming 2014', meaning it was directly 'tied' to one of the school's events. 

Dressed up: The teenage couple are pictured posing in another - less controversial - photo before the dance

It comes just days after teenager Jaylen Fryberg shot five classmates in the cafeteria at Marysville Pilchuck High School in Washington State, killing two girls and injuring the three others

The unsuspecting teens were all seated at a lunch table when 15-year-old Fryberg pulled out a .40-caliber Beretta handgun and shot each one, before committing suicide.

On Monday, investigators said the shooter had lured his victims to the scene by text message before launching the deadly attack.
