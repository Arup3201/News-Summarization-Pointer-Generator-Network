Chinese engineers have tested a laser weapon that can shoot down drones and small aircraft from more than a mile away. 

The weapon system is designed to protect major public gatherings from drone attack,and can destroy low-flying, slow moving aircraft. 

The Low Altitude Sentinel system was developed by the China Academy of Engineering Physics.

China has announced it has developed its own laser system to counter the threat posed by small drones 

Chinese officials fear the drones could be used to attack large public events  such as military parades 

According to Chinese State media the laser is able to destroy low-level slow-moving drones within five seconds

According to a report in the English-language China Daily, the laser can hit drones travelling below 1,600 feet at a speed of up to 110mph. 

China's Xinhau News Agency reported the new weapon system could be mounted to vehicles and deployed to protect major public events.

Yi Jinsong, who is involved with developing the project said: 'Intercepting such drones is usually the work of snipers and helicopters, but their success rate is not as high and mistakes with accuracy can result in unwanted damage.'

The United States has developed its own laser technology, with a prototype weapon fitted to a naval vessel to target drones and small aircraft. 

According to Chinese officials, their new system can shoot down a rogue drone within five seconds of detecting its target.  

The reported development comes as concerns about the country's military preparedness are being raised in state media. A front page article in China's official military newspaper last month said that weaknesses in military training posed a threat to the country's ability to fight and win a war.

The paper - the People's Liberation Army Daily - said in the same report that China's military authorities had sent a document out to units detailing 40 weaknesses in current training methods.

President Xi Jinping has been pushing to strengthen the fighting ability of China's 2.3 million-strong armed forces as they project power across disputed waters in the East and South China Seas. China has developed stealth jets and has built one aircraft carrier.

The country's armed forces, the world's largest, came under criticism earlier this year from serving and retired Chinese officers and state media, who questioned whether they were too corrupt to win a war. 

Andrew Davies, senior analyst at the Australian Strategic Policy Institute said: 'Whether you can shoot down a maneuvering, robust drone with a hard surface, perhaps with heat dissipation designed in, is something I'm not sure about, but it's at least plausible.'
