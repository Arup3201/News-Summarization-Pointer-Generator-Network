There's nothing quite like it after a hard day in the park. Chill out... have your nails done... relax with a facial... .

Then get someone to smooth all those nasty tangles from your hair with a luxury conditioner and massage, and finish it off with some Coco Chanel spray.

Ah, the comforts of being a pampered pooch – provided your devoted owner can cover a bill that could run into hundreds.

The services are being offered for dogs, cats and even horses by Michelle Inch, 25, at her Pawfection Pet Boutique in Barry, South Wales.

Michelle's tea-cup chihuahua Peekaboo is treated to a nail treatment, which costs £5 and allows you to match your own nail colour to your dog's

Pawfection Pet Boutique, Barry, has more than 2,000 clients on the books, including celebrities and WAGS, who pay up to £100 a time for their pets to enjoy luxury treatments such as facials

The animal lover, who spends £6,000 a year on clothing and grooming her two dogs, already has more than 2,000 clients on her books.

Michelle spent more than £40,000 to set up the business, which offers a range of luxury pampering treatments for pooches.

As well as the usual grooming, dog lovers can treat their beloved pets to a facial treatment to remove tear stains for £10. They can also be treated to a variety of fun and colourful fur dyes and glitter designs, costing between £60 and £100. 

The salon - which is kitted out with a diamante chandelier, polished granite flooring, and plush French furniture - even features a pet spa with a luxury walk-in wetroom.

Michelle, who has a six year old daughter
named Brooke, offers a range of glittery nail paint manicures and 
brightly coloured claw caps, with prices starting at £5.

'Claw caps are like fake nails for dogs. They're bright and fun, and also protect your household floors from scratches from their nails.

'The facial helps to remove tear stains from their faces and also is really relaxing for the dog - it sends them to sleep. We also do a soothing paw treatment which they love.

'I have always loved animals. I adore my two dogs and I also own horses.

'They are a part of the family. Why shouldn't they be treated and pampered every now and then? A lot of my customers treat their pets like their own children.

'I myself spend thousands of pounds every year on my two dogs, from clothes, special food and treats to beauty treatments.

'I've spent up to £6,000 a year - and they're worth it.'

After their treatments, pets are sprayed with a burst of Jean Paul Gaultier or Coco Channel finishing sprays.

Pet owners can then splurge out on treats such as specialised dog food, dog ice cream and birthday cakes. The boutique also features a wide range of dog clothing and shoes, with everything from customised collars and leads to a harness studded with diamante jewellery.

Michelle, who owns a tea-cup chihuahua named Peekaboo and a poodle called Fernando, sells wedding outfits, quirky fancy dress costumes, lifejackets and even hiking boots for dogs of all sizes.

The businesswoman grew up in Barry where she launched a home-based dog grooming enterprise when she was 18. She opened the salon in Park Road, Barry, in August 2013.

'It's the best thing I've ever done,' she added. 'Since the opening, we've had more than 2,000 clients - people thought it was a great idea and something the area really needed.

'Everyone loves the look of the place - it's like a real human salon where their pets can get spoiled rotten.

'I have various celebrities on my books who come in to get their dogs pampered for the day, including Premier League WAGS and rugby union wives too. Some women come in and spend around £500 in one go.

'A selection of my dog clothes have been purchased by cast members of The Only Way Is Essex. They have got some of the collars that I sell.

Michelle has also been crowned a Young Ambassador for business for The Prince's Trust by the Vale MP Alun Cairns and regularly gives motivational talks to youngsters looking to start their own businesses.
