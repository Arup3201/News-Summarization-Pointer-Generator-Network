Lord McAlpine is to ask police to investigate Twitter users who made ‘malicious communications’ against him.

The Tory peer plans to make a formal complaint today against potentially thousands who falsely named him as a paedophile – but who have failed to ‘repent’ for their actions.

Up to 10,000 Twitter users are thought to have tweeted about the former Tory Party treasurer’s alleged – but subsequently disproved – involvement in child abuse.

Lawyers said the Lord McAlpine, pictured, case could potentially involve the largest number of defendants in British legal history.

It is unclear how many have now apologised and agreed to pay a nominal sum as requested to Children in Need, but two days ago just 40 had done so.

The police complaint could lead to a mass prosecution, leading to fines, or even imprisonment for up to six months, and criminal records for the large numbers who wrote about the peer online.

The inquiry is the latest escalation of the affair which began when the BBC2 flagship Newsnight commissioned research into claims that a senior Tory was involved in child abuse at a children’s home in Wrexham.

The alleged victim later withdrew his claim, leading to the resignation of the BBC director general George Entwistle.

The BBC has already settled with the peer for £185,000.

Lord McAlpine is also understood to 
be seeking up to £500,000 in damages from ITV after This Morning 
presenter Phillip Schofield showed a list of alleged Tory paedophiles to
David Cameron.

Now the peer’s lawyers are believed 
to have identified 1,000 people who sent their own tweets implying or 
directly saying he was a paedophile – and a further 9,000 who 
‘retweeted’ the claims to others.

Among those potentially involved are 
comedian Alan Davies, who tweeted about ‘this Tory paedophile’, and then
named Lord McAlpine, to his 440,000 followers. Guardian columnist 
George Monbiot also tweeted about the peer.

BBC controversy: Lord McAlpine announced last week that he is taking landmark legal action against internet gossips who falsely branded him a paedophile after BBC's Newsnight broadcast the wrong claims

Mistake: Sally Bercow took to Twitter to comment on speculation as to the identity of the Tory at the centre of a Newsnight investigation and could be sued

Lord McAlpine’s legal team claim that the offending tweets are criminal offences under the Malicious Communications Act 1988, or alternatively under the Communications Act 2003’s prohibition against ‘improper use of a public electronic communications network’.

Earlier this month, nine people were prosecuted for circulating on Facebook and Twitter the name of a woman raped by a footballer. Each defendant was ordered to pay the rape victim £624 in damages.

Sally Bercow, wife of Commons Speaker John Bercow, is among those accused of revealing Lord McAlpine’s name after tweeting: ‘Why is Lord McAlpine trending? *innocent face*’.

This week she blundered again by tweeting the name of a schoolgirl who ran away to France with her teacher, risking a £5,000 fine for contempt of court.

Yesterday Mrs Bercow’s Twitter account suddenly disappeared.

Sorry we are unable to accept comments for legal reasons.
