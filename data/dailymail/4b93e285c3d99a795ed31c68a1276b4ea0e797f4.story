A cyclist who heckled Boris Johnson as he struggled up a steep hill on his bike today denied calling the London Mayor a ‘fat b******’.

Lycra-wearing Bob Carter was likened to Lord of the Rings creature Gollum by Mr Johnson after their two-wheeled war of words during the 100-mile RideLondon event.

The Tory heavyweight looked like he needed the exercise after being pictured wearing a billowing blue T-shirt while puffing his way around the course on Sunday.

Mr Johnson revealed the moment he was hit by a volley of abuse while battling to the top of Leith Hill in Surrey, the highest point in South East England.

‘Out of the corner of my eye I saw someone imitating me – pedalling alongside and puffing with satirical glee.

‘He was one of those Gollum-like creatures whose Lycra appeared to be shrink-wrapped about his spindly form,’ he wrote in his Daily Telegraph column.

‘His legs were as brown and thin as Victorian dining room chairs, and he seemed to be so totally hairless that one could imagine he applied Veet to every portion of his anatomy in order to minimise wind resistance.’

Mr Johnson claimed Mr Carter cackled: ‘Garn, Boris… put your back into it, you fat b*******.’

The Mayor said he wanted to be left along, but his tormentor continued: ‘What? I’ve waited years for the chance to torture you, and I’m not going to miss it this time!’

The London Mayor pedalled his road bike for eight hours through the capital and the Surrey Hills before rewarding himself with a bacon roll at the finish on The Mall near Buckingham Palace.

But today his persecutor was unmasked as Mr Carter, who claimed he was only rude to the politician because he ‘was really in trouble and looked very sickly’.

He added: ‘Hell would have to freeze over before I voted for him but fair play to him he completed the ride, which was very tough.

‘I was giving him a bit of abuse and I think he thought I called him ‘a fat b******’ but I didn’t. In Norwich we are far too polite for that,’ he told the Evening Standard.

He went on: ‘As for Gollum, he is a cheeky so and so saying that, I have never heard that one before.

‘I am glad he finished and if he wants to get fitter he is welcome to join us in Norwich on Sunday for our club ride.’

The race saw cyclists ride east through London before tackling the Surrey Hills and looping back around into the city along a similar route to the one tackled last year during the Olympic road races.
