They have fought for the best positions on the Nascar track and now two of the sport's drivers are fighting over who owns a racing car hauler.

Seven vehicles allegedly stolen from racing driver Jennifer Jo Cobb last year have been removed by police from two garages belonging to Nascar driver Mike Harmon.

The removal of the vehicles from Mr Harmon's garage in Catawba County, North Carolina, comes two weeks after he was arrested on a separate charge of breaking into Ms Cobb's property and stealing her car transporter.

Mr Harmon, who denies he stole the hauler, told WBTV: 'I've never stolen as much as a piece of bubble gum. To be arrested for a felony is ridiculous.'

He added: 'Why would you put yourself in harm's way like that?'

Until last year the drivers raced on the same side, with Mr Harmon acting as Miss Cobb's team manager when she raced for the Nationwide team.

This year however, the 40-year-old from Kansas City is racing in the Camping World Truck Series under her own name - Jennifer Jo Cobb Racing Team.

Mr Harmon, who has not been charged with stealing the seven vehicles taken from his garage, is under a judge's order to keep his distance from Ms Cobb.

The hauler, valued at $279,000, has still not been found.

Rowan District Attorney’s Office investigators have not yet said if charges will be brought against Mr Harmon for the second time this month, according to the Charlotte Observer.

Mr Harmon, 55, was not available for comment when the newspaper approached him.

At the heart of the missing vehicles saga is a dispute between Ms Cobb and her former JJC Racing business partner David Novak over the ownership of the trailer and racing equipment.

The former business partners have been in litigation over the ownership of the team since parting ways in December.

Mr Novak cut ties 'personally and professionally' with Ms Cobb in December, according to a statement he released last year.

In February Mr Novak had a team van confiscated from Ms Cobb, who has had only one top ten finish in 85 combined starts, when she was making a public appearance with her team in Florida, according to the Daytona Beach News-Journal.

Mr Novak claimed he owned the van and showed documents to police allegedly proving he had made payments and insured the van.

Mr Harmon became involved because he had helped arrange Ms Cobb and Mr Novak's venture in 2010. He said he helped Mr Novak collect the trailer, which was taken to Denver, North Carolina, in December. 

Ms Cobb took the trailer back in January, claiming that it belonged to her.

Earlier in the month Mr Harmon told Associated Press: 'I just want to do my racing deal and let them fight it out court. They was in the relationship, this is their fight.

Mr Harmon, who is best known for a crash that nearly split his car in two on a practice lap in 2002, described Ms Cobb as 'pure evil' and said: 'She doesn't care about anybody but Jennifer.'

Both drivers plan to finish the racing season.
