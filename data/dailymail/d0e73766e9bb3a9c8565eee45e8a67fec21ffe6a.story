Warning: Former Attorney General Dominic Grieve claims the atrocities in Iraq should be a warning that leaving Europe would be a disaster for Britain

Sacked Tory Cabinet minister Dominic Grieve said yesterday that it would be a disaster if Britain walked out of the European human rights court.

Mr Grieve said the barbaric slaughter in northern Iraq showed the importance of sticking to human rights rules.

The former Attorney General was removed from office in David Cameron’s reshuffle last month, amid speculation that a clear-out of Cabinet europhiles is meant to pave the way for repeal of the Human Rights Act and a British rebellion against the demands of the European human rights court.

Mr Grieve has consistently maintained that Britain must stick to its legal obligations to obey the rulings of the Strasbourg-based court, and that to fail to do so would encourage aggressive and violent behaviour by countries on the fringes of Europe.

He spoke in the aftermath of the Strasbourg ruling on Tuesday in which European judges removed the threat to British taxpayers of millions of pounds of compensation payments to prisoners who have been denied the vote. 

In a test case the human rights court said Britain is wrong to deny the vote to convicted prisoners, but it refused to pay 10 Scottish prisoners either compensation or costs to pay their lawyers’ bills.

‘There are suggestions that my own party wants in some way to enact legislation if we get into government to prevent the court's judgments being implemented unless the Parliament approves it,’ Mr Grieve said on the BBC Radio Four Today Programme.

‘That would be, in my view, a disaster.’

He added: ‘It would put us in breach of our international legal obligations, would place us in great difficulty in terms of our international standing on human rights.

‘And one only has to look at what is going on at the moment in northern Iraq to see that human rights do matter.’

Mr Grieve’s line that by sticking to Strasbourg law Britain can keep rogue countries in order has been provoking frustration among eurosceptics, who say that Russia is a member of the European Court of Human Rights, yet it does not seem to be respecting international law.

His Tory critics also believe many Strasbourg judgements are politically motivated and intended to underline the superior powers of the human rights judges.

The former Attorney General said that rather than quitting the court, ‘we ought to be acting prudently and moderately in trying to get the changes we want.’ 

The refusal to give compensation to prisoners denied the vote was ‘a hopeful sign’ that its judges have been listening to British opinion.

‘My view is that we need to have a robust dialogue with the court and I think we have been trying to have that,’ he said. 

‘Our own judiciary have been saying quite clearly that they think there are areas where the court is not as good as it should be. The danger for the UK is that if we engage in sabre-rattling with the court, I don't think it will be constructive.

‘I think we are in danger of making a very serious mistake, one that would be reputationally very damaging to the Conservative Party in any future government. 

Danger: He warns that by leaving the European Court of Human Rights, Britain could be in danger of breaching our international legal obligations. He claims sabre-rattling with the court will not be constructive

'There are other ways forward. The danger is if one gets carried away with one's own rhetoric, one can do a lot of damage to the country. Because ultimately this country is founded on the rule of law.’

Senior Tories have indicated that the Party is preparing to repeal the Human Rights Act and produce a British Bill of Rights in place of it. 

A British rights charter would strain the relationship with the Strasbourg court, with its parent body the Council of Europe, and with the EU.

Yesterday it was disclosed that Home Secretary Theresa May has advised Mr Cameron that Britain must withdraw from the European Convention on Human Rights which the Strasbourg court exists to enforce, and sources close to Justice Secretary Chris Grayling said that Labour’s Human Rights Act, which makes European rights part of British law, will be repealed if the Tories win next year’s election.

Eurosceptic Tory MPs said that Strasbourg had pulled back from trying to force compensation payments for prisoners because of the growing fear in Europe that Britain will pull out.

Clacton MP Douglas Carswell said: ‘This was a rare outbreak of common sense from this federalist court. It is amazing what you achieve when you threaten to quit.’

MP John Hemming from the pro-European LibDem party said: ‘The prisoner ruling was a politically considered move.

‘The European Court of Human Rights needs to be accountable. At the moment, on something like prisoner voting, they just go off on one. 

'They should be subject to democratic accountability from the parliament of the Council of Europe.’
