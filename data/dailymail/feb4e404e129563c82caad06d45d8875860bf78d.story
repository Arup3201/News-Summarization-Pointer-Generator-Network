Novak Djokovic began his began his challenge for a hat-trick of ATP World Tour Finals triumphs in London with a 6-1 6-1 demolition of Croatia's Marin Cilic on Monday.

The Serbian world number one produced a ruthless display against a ragged U.S. Open champion, opening his Group A account with a 56-minute masterclass.

The 27-year-old has now won 28 consecutive matches indoors dating back to 2012 and should he win his remaining two group matches against Stanislas Wawrinka and Tomas Berdych he will be guaranteed to end the year on top of the rankings.

Cilic won the opening five points of the match but his debut at the ATP's prestige event quickly turned sour as Djokovic turned up the heat with a clinical display. 

Djokovic said: 'It was a great performance. I was hoping I could play this way. I was preparing myself for this match. I knew already one week ago that I was going to play Marin.

'Marin as a U.S. Open winner has a lot of confidence, but I managed to neutralise his serve and get a lot of ball back in play and that was part of the tactic.' 

'You could see that he didn't feel so comfortable. I tried to use my experience playing on this stage, the stadium, which is pretty different from any other.'

Djokovic's result mirrored group rival Stan Wawrinka's earlier thrashing of Thomas Berdych

Stanislas Wawrinka pummelled Tomas Berdych by the same 6-1 6-1 scoreline in 58 minutes before the evening's second match - making Monday's singles the most one-sided contests since the Tour Finals arrived in London in 2009, eclipsing Roger Federer's victory over Rafael Nadal in 2011 for the loss of three games.

'Unfortunately, it was my worst match of the whole season, and I kept it for the start here in the World Tour Finals,' said Berdych. 

In 2009 eight of the 12 round-robin matches went to three sets. None of the four singles matches so far have gone the distance and organisers and fans alike will be hoping for a rise in the excitement levels in the days to come.
