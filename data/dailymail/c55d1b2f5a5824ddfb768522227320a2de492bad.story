Paul Lambert has told exciting young winger Jack Grealish that Aston Villa is the ideal place to progress his career as contract talks progress amid interest from Chelsea.

Grealish, who turned 19 this month, has made a promising start to life in the Villa first team this season with three appearances off the bench in the Premier League, but his current deal runs out next summer.

The lifelong Villa fan, who joined the club aged six and is rated very highly, has spoken of his intentions to stay at the club and a four-year contract is on the table.

‘This is the best place to be because he’s getting the chance to get round and about our first team,’ said Lambert.

‘He’s playing little bits here and there but he’s still far from being an establish player. He’s not near the finished article. But he’s developing, which is great. The way his career is going hopefully something will be done.’

Negotiations are also underway with Fabian Delph and Ron Vlaar, who both see their contracts expire at the end of this season. ‘They’re different from Jack because they’re seasoned pros. We will see what happens,’ added Lambert. ‘We’re talking to their respective parties. That’s the good thing.’

Lambert insisted he would receive backing in his bid to tie down the trio from owner Randy Lerner, who attended his first match in two years for the visit of Arsenal last weekend — a sight suggesting his move to sell the club are on the backburner.

The Villa manager revealed Lerner is likely to come to more matches and added he has already begun discussing the January transfer window with new chief executive Tom Fox, presenting a sign of the American’s longer-terms plans.

‘Ultimately the decision will come from the chairman, what he wants to do,’ said Lambert. ‘He’s never once said to me, “You cant do x, y and z”. If he thinks it’s too dear he’ll say no, if he thinks it’s fine he’ll say fine. That’ s all you want, honesty.

‘If someone comes in (with a bid) that will make Aston Villa stronger and is right for the chairman, I still think that (sale) will happen. But while he is here he will continue to make Aston Villa the best it can be.’
