A Long Island man accused of hacking his mother to death with an axe last month was all smiles while being led away by police.

Sean Farrell, 24, was arrested last week after reportedly confessing to his grandmother that he brutally murdered his mother Bonnie Farrell, 45, Dec 9 at their Medford home.

‘He told me he killed his mom, my daughter, and that he was selfish and should have killed himself,’ grieving grandmother Letitia Dunn told police in a written statement, court documents revealed.

Why so serious?: Farrell appeared almost aloof in front of the media, saying he would talk only to the judge

Police say Farrell repeatedly struck his mother in the head with an axe, her bloody corpse was discovered later that day by husband and stepfather Eric Connolly, 47.

Charges weren’t brought against Farrell until now because he secretly checked himself into Bellevue Hospital’s mental ward shortly after the killing, according to News 12.

The accused ax murderer’s grandfather told the station he has schizophrenia and shouldn’t be behind bars.

‘The doctor took him off his medication and my daughter tried to get him back on his medication,’ said Gene Dunn, barely able to lift his head while talking.

‘People take this schizophrenia very seriously, it's a dangerous disease and we didn't know how dangerous it was, unfortunately,’ he somberly added.

Bonnie Farrell had become increasingly concerned with his mental state in the days leading up to the killing and had planned to take him to a hospital the day after her killing, Gene Dunn told the New York Post.

Authorities arrested Farrell Thursday and charged him with second-degree murder. The deranged man smiled for the waiting press corps as he was led Friday out of the Suffolk County Police Department's Fifth Precinct.

When asked about the charges by a News 12 reporter, he replied ‘it’s a long story, I’m going to save it for the judge.’

He notably did not deny his guilt.

Defense attorney Daniel Russo told reporters outside a local courthouse after Farrell’s arraignment that he ‘appears to suffer from some form of schizophrenia,’ according to Newsday.

Farrell's Facebook page contains haunting references to plans and secrets, swastikas, skulls and pictures with chilling, wide-eyed stares.

'She didn't know his specific plans -- they were veiled as whatever secrets lay in that fat boy's heart -- but she was certain of his goal: To destroy all of them,' reads a disturbing cartoon on the page.

He was also obsessed with aliens, he occult and wrote a rambling post about mind control and the arrival of an alien overlord.

Gene Dunn told the Post the slaying is ‘a double tragedy.’

‘We lost our daughter and our grandson,’ he explained. ‘We love them both. We’re devastated.’

The grandfather added Farrell said to his grandmother after confessing: ‘I hope nobody is mad at me.’
