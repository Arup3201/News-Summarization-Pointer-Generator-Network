A unique species of fish that has remained virtually unchanged for more than 300 million years could reveal the secrets of evolution after scientists decoded its genome for the first time.

The Coelacanth is a sea-cave dwelling, five-foot long fish with limb-like fins.

It was once thought to be extinct, until a living coelacanth was discovered off the African coast in 1938.

Coelacanths today still closely resemble the fossilised skeletons of their 300-million-year-old ancestors.

Its genome confirms what many researchers had long suspected: genes in coelacanths are evolving slower than other organisms'.

'We found that the genes overall are evolving significantly slower than in every other fish and land vertebrate that we looked at,' said Jessica Alföldi, a research scientist at the Broad Institute and co-first author of a paper on the coelacanth genome, which appears in Nature this week.

'This is the first time that we've had a big enough gene set to really see that.'

Researchers believe the slow rate of change may be because coelacanths simply have not needed to change: they live primarily off of the Eastern African coast (a second coelacanth species lives off the coast of Indonesia), at ocean depths where relatively little has changed over the millennia.

'We often talk about how species have changed over time,' said Kerstin Lindblad-Toh, scientific director of the Broad Institute's vertebrate genome biology group and senior author.

'But there are still a few places on Earth where organisms don't have to change, and this is one of them. Coelacanths are likely very specialized to such a specific, non-changing, extreme environment – it is ideally suited to the deep sea just the way it is.'

Because of their resemblance to fossils dating back millions of years, coelacanths today are often referred to as 'living fossils', a term first coined by Charles Darwin.

However, the team stress the coelacanth is not a relic of the past brought back to life.

They say it is a species that has survived, reproduced, but changed very little in appearance for millions of years.

'It's not a living fossil; it's a living organism,' said Alföldi. 'It doesn't live in a time bubble; it lives in our world, which is why it's so fascinating to find out that its genes are evolving more slowly than ours.'

Family tree: Coelacanth's closest relatives

The unique 'living fossil' has a 300-million-year fossil record, shown here.

During the Devonian geological period, descendants of pelagic lobe-finned fish – like Eusthenopteron – exhibited a sequence of adaptations:

Panderichthys, suited to muddy shallows;

Tiktaalik with limb-like fins that could take it up on to land

Acanthostega, which had feet with eight digits

Ichthyostega with limbs. Descendants also included pelagic lobe-finned fish such as coelacanth species

The coelacanth genome has also allowed scientists to test other long-debated questions, such as why it posseses features that look oddly similar to those seen only in animals that dwell on land, including 'lobed' fins, which resemble the limbs of four-legged land animals (known as tetrapods).

Another odd-looking group of fish known as lungfish possess lobed fins too.

It is likely that one of the ancestral lobed-finned fish species gave rise to the first four-legged amphibious creatures to climb out of the water and up on to land, but until now, researchers could not determine which of the two is the more likely candidate.

The coelacanth genome may hold other clues for researchers investigating the evolution of tetrapods.

'This is just the beginning of many analyses on what the coelacanth can teach us about the emergence of land vertebrates, including humans, and, combined with modern empirical approaches, can lend insights into the mechanisms that have contributed to major evolutionary innovations,' said Chris Amemiya, a member of the Benaroya Research Institute and co-first author of the Nature paper.
