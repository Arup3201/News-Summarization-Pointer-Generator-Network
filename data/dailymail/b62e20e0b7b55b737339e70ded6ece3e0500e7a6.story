Rich foreigners are queuing up to buy property in a £100million block of flats which boasts David Cameron and the Queen among the neighbours.

The former European Council for Foreign Relations in Westminster, central London, is set to be transformed into luxury properties, which developers expect to fetch around £5million each when sold.

The flats, at 29-35 Old Queen Street, will be the closest residential addresses to the Prime Minister and Chancellor's official homes in Downing Street.

A computer-generated vision of how the flats' interiors will look. Each property is expected to sell for between £1.5million and £5million - meaning the building's residents will pay a combined £7million in stamp duty

Developers expect most of the luxury flats to be bought off-plan by super-rich Middle Eastern Asian and Russian buyers before the project is completed

Residents of the building, dubbed 'mini Hyde Park One' after London's current most-exclusive address, will be handing over a combined £7 million to their government neighbours in stamp duty tax.

Despite their multi-million pound price-tags, the flats are expected to be snapped up before they are finished by foreign buyers who want to live on the doorstep of Downing Street.

Galliard Homes today confirmed they have now been granted planning permission for the transformation. They will be converting the 27,190 sq/ft building into 22 one, two and three bedroom apartments, including duplexes and penthouses.

The building will include a rooftop garden and marble entrance foyer with concierge. Flats will cost from £1.6 to £5 million with the architects Squire and Partners behind the design.

It is 
anticipated the apartments will be sold off-plan before the project is 
completed by super-wealthy Middle East, Asian and Russian buyers, 
according to Galliard.

The luxury flats, on Old Queen Street, Westminster, will be just a stone's throw from Downing Street, Whitehall and Buckingham Palace

The new residences will be set over nine floors and range from 527 sq/ft up to 1,518 sq/ft in size

Stephen
 Conway, chief executive of Galliard Homes, said: 'Our Squire & 
Partners project is the most luxurious residential development 
undertaken to date in Westminster and will help to raise residential 
values in the district to be in line with neighbouring Mayfair and 
Marylebone.

'Prime London residential values have overtaken commercial, and this means that the West End, Westminster and Whitehall is rapidly transforming from being dominated by offices into addresses associated with London’s most luxurious new residences and 5 star hotels.

'This project is the latest part in this ongoing evolution and we anticipate strong sales interest in the scheme.'

Built in the early 1900s, 29-35 Old Queen Street originally provided grand mansions lived in by Westminster politicians and wealthy merchants.

After the Second World War, the building was converted into offices and served as the London headquarters of the European Council for Foreign Relations.

Galliard Homes acquired the freehold of the building and recently applied for planning permission for a change of use back to residential.

Set over nine floors, the new residences will range from 527 sq/ft up to 1,518 sq/ft in size. It is expected they will cost in excess of £3,000 per sq/ft, setting a new record in the area.
