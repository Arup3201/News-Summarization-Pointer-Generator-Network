Contaminated: A couple found a fly crawling around inside a bowl of mashed potato from Sainsbury's

Mr Rice, 62, filmed the fly moving inside the pre-prepared mash and posted the video on YouTube.

Mrs Rice, 59, bought the packet of Sainsbury's Classic Buttery Mashed Potato for £2.50 from the supermarket's West Green branch outside Crawley, West Sussex.

She and her husband planned to use the potato in an impromptu roast dinner until they noticed that it was contaminated.

'At first I thought it was on top so I went to brush it away - but when I couldn't I suddenly realised it was inside the packet,' Mrs Rice said.

Disgust: Hayley and Chris Rice say they could have fallen ill if they had eaten the potato

'I was absolutely horrified, if we'd have not noticed and cooked that we could have fallen ill as a result.

'It just makes your stomach turn, it's horrible.'

Mrs Rice, a writer, immediately phoned the store where she had bought the potato, but she claims they hung up on her four times.

Complaint: Mrs Rice has now sent the product to be inspected by local health officials

When she contacted the chain's head office, they told her to take the product back to the store to be inspected.

But when Mrs Rice contacted the environmental health department at the local council, they said they would collect the mashed potato from her.

A spokesman for Sainsbury's said: 'We apologise to Chris and Hayley Rice and will be investigating how this could have happened.'
