A Peruvian housekeeper has accused a top United Nations official of treating her like a virtual slave.

María Ríos Fun, 40, is suing Marita Puertas Pulgar, the first secretary of the Peruvian mission, and her husband, Alexis Aquino Albegrin, claiming the couple lured her from Lima, Peru to the U.S. with the promise of fair wages and a humane work schedule but when she arrived it was all a sham.

According to Ms Ríos, she was given just one day off every six weeks and could only leave the house to pick up the couple's children.

All the while she was being bullied and coerced by the pair, she said in a lawsuit filed in Newark.

'I don't want others to go through what I did,' she told The New York Times.

Ms Puertas and Mr Aquino have vehemently rejected the human trafficking allegations, adding that they were 'surprised' by what the woman, who they'd known for a decade, claimed happened.

Ms Ríos worked for the couple in Buenos Aires in the early 2000s and late in Lima Peru but did not complain about their treatment during those postings.

However, she claims a contract she signed with her employers before coming to the U.S. in October 2012, which promised weekends and overtime pay, was entirely disregarded.

Under the terms of the contract, according to The New York Times, she would be paid $9.82 per hour to work as a 'housekeeper' for seven hours a day, five days a week and if any overtime would be paid at $14.73 per hour.

She also was promised sick days and 15 paid vacation days per year, as well as three meals a day, six days a week, the lawsuit states.

But as soon as she arrived, the contract was thrown out the window she claims, and she was forced to work from dawn to 10 p.m. not only cleaning the two-story, four-bedroom house but also to cook for the family of six. She had to care and change the youngest child, who was 18-months, and drive the older children to and from school.

She was also required to tend to house guests and the garden, she claims and was only given 'very basic food, like bread and coffee,' meaning she 'frequently was hungry.'

The agreed wage also turned out to be a lie, according to The Times.

Instead of the $9.82 an hour promised, she said the couple told her they would pay her a flat rate of $900 a month, slashing the earnings she had been expecting.

But even that didn't happen she claims. According to Ms Ríos, she said she only got several hundred dollars each month after the couple  deducted cash to cover the cost of clothing and toiletries they bought her.

She was also only given four days off in six months, she said, and was confined to the home where she was subjected to 'verbal abuse and psychological coercion.'

On April 27, it got too much and Ms Ríos called a national human trafficking hot line that was listed in documents she had been given at the United States embassy in Lima. 

She ran away, seeking refuge at Safe Horizon, an agency in New York City that helps crime victims.

The organization gave her counseling and a lawyer, who presumably helped with the suit.

The lawsuit said Ms Ríos is seeking unspecified back wages and damages for trafficking and breach of contract and she wants her belongings back.
