The Socialist mayor of Paris has announced plans to ban smoking in city parks as part of a plan to cut down on tobacco-related illnesses.

In a muddled announcement on national TV on Sunday, Anne Hidalgo said the move would be an experiment aimed at ‘teaching people about cigarette addiction’.

This is despite the recent history of France’s capital being associated with famous Parisians puffing away in world-famous parks such as the Luxembourg Gardens and Tuileries.

Aware of the massive opposition that there will be to the move in a country where some 30 per cent of the country still smoke, Ms Hidalgo insisted that her ‘experiment’ would not be strictly enforced.

‘We are not into banning, we are experimenting,’ said Ms Hidalgo, who said parks in the unfashionable 14th arrondissement would act as ‘guinea pigs in this experiment’.

But the move follows a new Socialist directive which allows bosses to ban wine in the work place – leading to accusations that the very heart of Gallic culture is under attack.

Traditionally liberal Parisians are renowned the world over for sitting outside smoking and drinking as they discuss the arts and philosophy.

Smoking is already technically banned in cafes, restaurants, stations and museums in Paris

Smoking is now technically banned in all inside public places in France, including cafes, restaurants, stations and museums.

But terraces and other places outdoors are not included in the ban, because the chances of smokers harming those sitting around them are considered miniscule.

Smoking is also on course to be banned in public parks and other council-controlled outdoor areas in Scotland, under radical plans to make the country ‘smoke free’ by 2034.

Tobacco-related illnesses are a leading cause of death in France, with an estimated 73,000 deaths annually.

Despite massive taxes on cigarette sales, health warnings, and every more stringent bans, there are still some 16 million smokers in France.

France is ‘paralysed’ and desperately needs reforms aimed at revitalising its crumbling economy, claims the country’s Socialist Prime Minister.

Manuel Valls spoke out during the first day of a vital business summit aimed at creating half-a-million jobs and cutting public spending in return for lower taxes.

The country’s unemployment rate has soared above the 3.3 million mark as entrepreneurs leave because of failing Socialist policies, including a top tax rate of 75 per cent.

Mr Valls said reforms were desperately needed because France was ‘paralysed’ by fear of ‘blockages’.

He said Socialist President Francois Hollande is determined to implement reforms, despite opposition from his own party.

On Sunday night, Mr Valls told Socialists in Vauvert:  ‘Without reforms, we are threatened by the stalemate, stalled and thus in decline. To not move forward is to start losing.’

Mr Valls said his aim was to ‘set France in motion’.
