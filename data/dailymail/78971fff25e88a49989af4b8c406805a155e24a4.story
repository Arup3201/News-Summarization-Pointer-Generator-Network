Young men aged between 16 - 24 are the most likely to shave, wax and 'manscape' their body hair

Record numbers of the nation’s men are turning to manscaping, which involves shaving, plucking and even the ‘boyzilian’ – the male version of the painful Brazilian wax.

The pressure is felt particularly by young men – aged 16-24 – with some six in ten saying they now routinely groom their body hair, according to research by retail analysts Mintel.

However, older men are also falling into line with a trend that was apparently started by sportsmen and style icons such as David Beckham, Christiano Ronaldo, Tom Cruise and Jake Gyllenhaal.

Mintel suggests the trend may have been triggered by elite athletes, such as professional cyclists or swimmers, who remove their body hair to improve their performance.

In a study published today, Mintel said: ‘Whilst once it was the preserve of elite athletes, it seems that more men are plucking up the courage to achieve a hair-free body.

‘Half of all Brits admit there is more pressure nowadays for men to remove or groom body hair. Indeed, for today’s modern man, hair removal has extended past a simple shave of the face.’

It found that over the last 12 months, some 55 per cent of men say they have removed hair from their head, this is followed by the pubic region at 29 per cent.

For generations, the idea of having a hairy chest and body was considered a sign of virility and masculinity. However, the Mintel study found that some 13 per cent remove their chest hair.

Its survey also found that 12 per cent trim their underarms and back, six per cent their bottoms, five per cent the arms, four per cent the legs and two per cent their feet.

Additionally, Mintel’s research highlights how Britain’s men are giving Cara Delevingne and her famous eyebrows a run for her money, with one in four shaping their eyebrows.

Charlotte Libby, senior beauty analyst at Mintel, said: ‘It is becoming increasingly commonplace for men, particularly the under-30s, to remove hair from their body as behaviours once described as metrosexual are becoming increasingly mainstream.

‘Major sporting events such as the 2014 Commonwealth Games and the media attention given to the swimming team and their hair-free bodies in particular, drew focus to male body hair removal.’

Overall, one in five men claim they feel expected to remove hair from their torso, while around the same number say they feel the pressure to remove hair from their underarms and 13 per cent from their legs.

She said: ‘It is younger men in particular who are feeling the pressure to achieve a hair free body, with some six in ten 16-24-year-old men agreeing they feel pressure to remove or groom body hair, compared to 22 per cent of over-65s.

Men are increasingly shaving off much more than just their facial hair, the research showed

‘And while 42 per cent of Brits believe it is fashionable for men to have beards, almost the same number say they feel pressure from others to keep their facial hair neat and tidy.’

The trend towards hair removal for men is following something that has become a normal part of the beauty routine for the nation’s women.

The Mintel figures show 82 per cent of women remove hair from their legs, while a further 78 per cent shave under their arms and 57 per cent do so around their pubic region.

Miss Libby said: ‘The shaving and hair removal market is benefiting from the social norm for body hair to be removed.’

However, she said some women are trying to mount a backlash through initiatives such as ‘Armpits 4 August’ and the ‘Hairy Legs Club’ which is advocating a return to a more natural look.

Mintel said the new enthusiasm for getting rid of body hair is driving a market in razers, creams and potions worth £624million in 2014, which is up by 2.1 per cent on last year.
