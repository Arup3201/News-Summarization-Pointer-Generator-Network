She can lift four times her own body weight and her immense strength would make even the world's keenest weightlifters recoil in shame.

Varya Akulova is believed to be the world's strongest girl and her strength is so remarkable that at 14 she could lift a staggering 48 stone - the equivalent of four grown men.

Despite her slight frame and tiny muscles, the 20-year-old, who aged 10 managed to flip her 17-and-a-half stone father Uri while wrestling, shows no signs of getting weaker.

Muscles: Varya poses in a bikini and her barely there muscles give no visible indication of her true strength

Dubbed 'Girl Hercules', her parents first noticed their daughter's unusual strength when she was just one. By the tender age of seven she was competing in and winning power-lifting competitions and could even lift up her father - a professional circus strongman.

A year later she could support the weight of four children sitting on her body and aged nine she could easily lift both of her parents on her back.

These feats are even more impressive considering Varya was only eating noodles and water at the time as that was all the family could afford.

But despite her poor diet, her 
strength kept increasing and by 10 the Ukrainan 
schoolgirl could easily carry three people on her shoulders.

That year, in 2002, she set a Guinness 
World Record, lifting 220 pounds (100kg) while weighing just 40kg 
herself. Just four years later she managed to lift 48 stone (300kg).

Her father Uri, who says that by 
the age of 12 his daughter was stronger then him, thinks his side of the
family have a rare strength gene that few others have.

Varya's great-grandfather managed the astonishing feat of carrying 2,600lbs (1,200kg) on his back in 1910 and her mother Larisa is also stronger than most women.

Encouragement: Varya's father Uri supervises his daughter as she lifts a weight as a child. He believes she was stronger than him by 12-years-old despite being brought up on a meager diet of noodles and water

Despite her astonishing strength, Varya's muscles are barely visible and she has thread-like tendons. At 5ft tall, she weighs just over eight stone.

She
sets her many strength records with relative ease as her father only 
lets her show about 75 per cent of her maximum strength for health and 
safety reasons.

As a child she showcased her strength in the circus, alongside her performing parents, and later at acrobatic shows.

And, it's not just her physical strength that's impressive. She is also a top student and learned to read aged just three.

But despite her talents, Varya, who 
is trained in acrobatics, boxing, kick boxing, wrestling and circus 
juggling skills, wishes she was bigger.

She said: 'I do not take steroids, I only take multi vitamins. I wish I could be big, really big: 190 cm tall and weigh more than 100 kg, like my dad.'

Varya's diet has also improved over the years. She now eats one egg and a glass of 
juice and bread for breakfast, bread and a cup of tea for lunch and for 
dinner she often tucks into macoroni noodles and occasionally some meat, if her family can afford it.
She also drinks one glass of milk a day for calcium.
