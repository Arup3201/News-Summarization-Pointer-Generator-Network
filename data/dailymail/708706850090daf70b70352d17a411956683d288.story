Fuel duty in remote rural areas will be slashed by 5p a litre under plans to be put forward by ministers this week.

Treasury chief secretary Danny Alexander will apply to the European Commission for permission to vary the fuel duty rate in 15 remote parts of the country.

If approved, petrol and diesel prices in these areas will be cut by 5p in recognition of the higher cost of supplying fuel to remote areas.

Similar rules already apply in the Scottish islands, the Isles of Scilly and other island communities in Europe. But the EU has never approved the scheme for use in mainland areas.

AA president Edmund King has warned the scheme would be ‘very difficult’ to design. He said there was a risk it could create a postcode lottery in the countryside, with motorists given a perverse incentive to drive to remote areas to fill up.

But the Treasury insists the scheme is simply designed to bring relief to motorists facing some of the highest fuel prices in the country.

Mr Alexander, whose Scottish Highlands constituency may benefit from the scheme, said: ‘I want to do everything I can for those in remote areas and I will be taking the case to Brussels.’

The Treasury invited fuel retailers in 35 parts of the country to submit evidence about their costs earlier this summer.

Most of the areas are in Scotland, but the review included parts of Wales, Northern Ireland and England.

English counties included Devon, Cumbria, Herefordshire and North Yorkshire. In Wales, Gwynedd, Powys, Monmouthshire and the Isle of Anglesey were also included.

Treasury sources stressed that only ‘very remote’ areas, rather than entire counties or regions, were likely to qualify.

The final list will be published later this week.

The European Commission has approved a number of fuel rebate schemes, but they have always been restricted to island communities.

The Treasury argues that the cost pressures in some remote mainland areas are identical. But they concede they face a tough fight in Brussels to get the proposals through.

Sources dismissed the idea that motorists would be encouraged to drive to remote areas to fill up if the discount is approved.

‘The criteria are very strict,’ a source said. ‘The areas have to be sufficiently remote that there would be no profit from driving there to fill up.

‘There is no precedent for this in Europe in a mainland area. We are pushing the boundaries and it is going to difficult to get it through.

But we think there is a good case for it.’ The limited scheme would only cost the Treasury a few million pounds a year, but Mr Alexander argues it would give remote rural communities a valuable boost.

Britain has one of the highest levels of fuel duty in Europe, although Chancellor George Osborne has pledged to freeze it until the election to help motorists.
