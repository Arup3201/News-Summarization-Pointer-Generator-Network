In the latest of our regular series on the travel tales of the rich and famous, forever-young model Twiggy tells us about suncream disasters, rain in Spain and the timeless joys of North Wales. 

Do you like cruising holidays? 

I have only been on two cruises and enjoyed both. My first was in 2012, when I was invited by Seabourn to be godmother to one of their new ships. What I like about cruising is that you get to visit lots of different countries but only have to unpack once.

Twiggy: Won't make the sun-cream mistake twice

Favourite places in the UK? 

Portmeirion in North Wales. It was designed in the style of an Italian village and feels like entering another world. It's so colourful, with rhododendron, azalea and camellia bushes.

Favourite hotel in the world? 

Le Touessrok in Mauritius. It was my daughter Carly's 15th birthday when we went, and we treated her to lunch on the hotel's private island. We also tried paragliding, and although I was screaming all the way, the views of the clear turquoise sea and surrounding landscape were well worth it.

What's the strangest meal you've eaten?

Leigh was playing Oberon in a Royal Shakespeare production of A Midsummer's Dream in Japan, and we went to a restaurant for soup which had real gold leaf floating on top.

It didn't actually taste of anything, though.

Worst holiday disaster?

A friend once lent us her villa near Valencia.

Before we arrived, the sun had been shining continuously for three months. But when we got there, it started raining and didn't stop for the next eight days. We became good at jigsaws, though.

Any packing tips?

Roll up your clothes in your suitcase rather than laying them flat. Apart from not creasing as much, you can pack more in. Also, never pack any liquids - a bottle of suntan oil once came open in my suitcase and ruined my favourite clothes, which I was really upset about.

Where are you off to next?

New York. Besides London, it's my favourite city in the world. In the early Eighties, I was in a Broadway musical called My One And Only, which ran for a couple of years. I made lots of friends, so New York is now like a second home to me.
