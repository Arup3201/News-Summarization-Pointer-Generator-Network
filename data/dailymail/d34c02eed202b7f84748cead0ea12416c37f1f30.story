TSA agents allowed a convicted felon and former member of a domestic terrorist group to pass through an expedited security line, Homeland Security's internal watchdog has revealed.

The passenger, whose identity has not been released, has served years in prison for murder and offenses involving explosives, the Department of Homeland Security's Inspector General's Office said as it revealed the 'significant aviation security breach' in a statement on Thursday night.

The watchdog was asked to investigate the June 2014 incident last October after a whistleblower came forward. It did not release specific details of the passenger's criminal history or where the incident took place.

The passenger, who is a U.S. citizen, had not registered for the TSA's PreCheck program, but if they had, they would have been rejected because of their convictions, the office said in the statement.

Instead, they were selected for the screening through the Secure Flight program's 'risk assessment rules', the watchdog said.

The program compares information the traveler has given their airline with information from the Terrorist Screening Database, No Fly lists and other intelligence-based systems to determine if they can board the plane and to identify low-risk passengers for expedited screening.

After determining a passenger can be pre-screened, it allows them to print documents carrying the PreCheck sign.

The TSA was unable to show the traveler's vetting results because they are deleted seven days after travel, the Inspector General's Office said.

When the passenger reached the airport, an agent looked at their documents.

'After checking the traveler's boarding pass and identification, an alert Transportation Security officer at the airport recognized the felon and alerted his supervisor,' the watchdog said, CNN reported. 

'However, the supervisor directed the [officer] to take no action and allow the traveler to continue through the TSA pre-check lane.' 

As part of the PreCheck system, the passenger - who has a criminal history involving explosives - would not have had to take off their shoes or jackets or remove liquids from their carry-on luggage.   

Investigation: The TSA responded that all passengers, including those with PreCheck tickets, are subject to 'robust' checks. It is not known where the June 2014 breach took place

The incident was brought to the attention of the Inspector General's Office's after a whistleblower went to the U.S. Office of Special Counsel, an independent federal investigative agency.

A classified report was issued to TSA detailing the need to make changes to the PreCheck vetting and screening process.

On Thursday, the TSA said in a statement that it 'takes its responsibility for protecting the traveling public very seriously'.

'All passengers, including those with TSA PreCheck on boarding passes, are subject to a robust security approach that employs multiple layers of security, both seen and unseen,' it said.

The TSA added that the success of its pre-screening system relies on the intelligence and national law enforcement communities identifying passengers they believe to pose a risk - yet this passenger had not been place on one of their lists.

Still, the agency said it was reviewing the guidelines it provides to TSA officers and supervisors to ensure they 'clearly understand the procedure in the event a person or item presents a creditable threat to transportation security'.

PreCheck means passengers can keep on their jackets, do not need to remove shoes and do not need to take liquids out of their luggage
