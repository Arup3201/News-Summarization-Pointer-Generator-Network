A British teenager is still fighting for his life in a Turkish hospital after being slashed and stabbed while on holiday.

Callum Copson, 19, from Kennoway, near St Andrews, has undergone ten hours of life-saving surgery but is not out of the woods yet according to doctors.

Mr Copson suffered a massive wound to his stomach and had to squash his intestines back inside with his own hands, after being sliced with the jagged edge of a fruit knife after a row over a handbag.

Callum Copson, left, was stabbed in the stomach on Thursday when he went to the leather shop in Marmaris to exchange a bag with his girlfriend Erin Brown, right, who is maintaining a round-the-clock vigil by his bedside

The row, which took place in the 
popular Turkish resort of Marmaris, Turkey, on Wednesday, left him 
clutching his intestines and sobbing 'I don't want to die'.

Consultant surgeon, Dr Ozgur Basaran, said: 'We operated as soon as Callum arrived.

'He'd suffered severe injuries and we had to go in through a main artery.

'Due
 to the severity and extent of his injuries we had to operate twice. The
 first surgery took six hours and the second a further four hours.

After that Callum was admitted to intensive care and monitored round the clock.'

Dr
 Basaran, who works at Marmaris private Ahu Hetman Hospital, added: 
'Today we have removed Callum's nasal tubes but due to the extent of the
 damage we're unable to give a definite prognosis at this stage.'

Mr
 Copson jumped in to protect girlfriend Erin Brown, 18, after angry shop
 staff started lobbing, belts, bags and shoes at her following a row 
over a refund on a faulty bag last week.

But
 as Callum stepped in to shield Erin from the onslaught a 14-year-old 
local boy snatched up a knife, dashed into the shop and plunged the 
blade into Mr Copson's stomach then fled.

British
 tourists tried to help stem the flow of blood, as shocked the Scottish 
teenager clutched his bleeding guts and begged for help.

Eye-witness
 Sandra Dempsey, 54, said: 'There was blood everywhere. You could see 
his insides spewing out. It was unbelievably shocking. The poor lad just
 kept repeating 'I don't want to die' over and over.'

The furious row erupted in a leather shop in the popular tourist resort of Marmaris on Wednesday night.

The
 couple were staying at the Amore Hotel, had bought a bag in the shop on
 Monday - but realising it was faulty returned to the shop a couple of 
days later.

Ms Brown told police: 'I asked for a refund and was told that wasn't possible but that I could pick a replacement bag.

'When I picked a bag the owner said it was too expensive so I asked for a refund again and that's when the argument started.'

The shop was packed with customers as the row escalated.

Ms Brown revealed: 'The shop staff started shouting and throwing bags, belts and purses at me.

'Callum
 stepped in front to protect me and he and the shop owner carried on 
arguing and throwing bags at each other, when all of a sudden a young 
boy pushed past us and came face to face with Callum.

'I didn't see what happened but I saw his face and the flash of a blade in his hand before he ran off.

'Suddenly
 there was blood everywhere. I realised Callum had been seriously hurt. 
He was shocked and kept saying: "I don't want to die" - it was awful.

'Other tourists tried to help us and I was screaming for an ambulance as Callum collapsed on the street.'

Paramedics
 raced to the scene and rushed Mr Copson to hospital were he underwent 
the two life saving operations to repair the damage.

Another
 British eye-witness, who didn't want to be named, said: 'I was in the 
shop with my young son when the couple came in and asked for a refund on
 a faulty bag.

'Things seemed to spiral out of control very quickly and suddenly they were lobbing bags and belts at each other.

'The
 next minute the lad collapsed in a pool of blood, clutching his 
stomach. It was a gruesome scene and I covered my young son's eyes.

'It
 was a blood bath and everyone was in shock. The injured lad was 
terrified. Fortunately paramedics arrived on the scene in minutes and 
took him to hospital - I pray his ok.'

Callum Copson's parents Eric and Lorraine have rushed from their home in Leven, near St Andrews to join a bedside vigil for the teen

Following the attack 14-year-old Mehmet Karabulut, was taken to the police by his father who works in the bag shop.

Karabulut,
 who, according to family friends, has mental-health issues, told his 
dad and the police that he could remember holding a blood stained knife 
but nothing more.

He was remanded in custody by a judge who has ordered a psychiatric evaluation of the troubled teen.

Family
 friend Nadir Koyunbakan said: 'Mehmet has some psychiatric problems. He
 snatched the knife and stabbed the British boy when he saw him arguing 
with his boss.

'We are 
devastated for Callum Copson and his family. They are guests in Turkey 
and this should never have happened. We are so very sorry.'

Mr
 Copson, who works for frozen food giant Iceland, has come through both 
life-saving operations and is said to be in a 'stable' condition 
according to friends.

Callum's parents, Eric and Lorraine Copson, flew out from Scotland to join Ms Brown's vigil at their son's bedside.

The
 Foreign Office confirmed they have been alerted about the incident. A 
spokesperson said: 'We were informed of the hospitalisation of a British
 national in Marmaris, Turkey on 19 June. We are providing consular 
assistance.'
