After successfully cycling 3000 miles across America, Pippa Middleton has barely had time to catch her breath before embarking on her next challenge - a four mile swim across a tidal shipping strait in Turkey.

The 30-year-old was joined by her brother, James, and some of their other cycling teammates, to take part in the Bosphorus Cross Continental Swimming Race.

The event is organised by the Turkish Olympic Committee and attracts thousands of fit adventure-seekers from around the world, keen to taken on the challenging open water swim.

Participants have to negotiate the tidal waters to plot the fastest route, avoid jellyfish and beat the clock - the busy shipping canal can only be closed for two hours so anyone not finished in that time is pulled out of the race.

Pippa told Hello! magazine that the 'fear of being plucked out of the water' motivated her to train hard to guarantee success as she aimed to complete the swim for charity last month.

In a first-person account of her experience, Pippa told the magazine how she started training for the event in June by doing lengths in a 40ft pool and practising open water swimming in Majorca, Brighton and the TRI20 Swim Centre at Reading Lake Hotel.

Blame it on the beard: James joined his sister for the bike ride and the swim but when she beat him at the latter, he joked it was because he hadn't streamlined by shaving

From Asia to Europe: The route Pippa and James swam in the race

The sister of the Duchess of Cambridge said she had to learn about stroke and breathing techniques to prepare herself for the swim from Asia to Europe, where competitors do not wear wetsuits.

She was already in good shape having just completed her epic bike ride but she added that she supplemented her swimming training with Pilates and jogging and had regular sports massages to prevent injury.

But she explained: 'Nothing could have prepared me for the experience of the race itself in Istanbul... The swim requires not only speed and athleticism but also the nous to navigate yourself on the right course.'

Eating well was also essential and Pippa told the magazine she stuck to a diet of 'wholesome carbs' like brown rice, lentils and quinoa and lots of protein - which aids muscle repair.

She said: 'To maintain energy I try to eat more protein, particularly fish or chicken... a lot of people swear by carb-loading in the run-up to an event but it doesn't really work for me, so I just up my protein intake.'

The night before the race they feasted on seafood and then she tucked into a bowl of porridge with honey, banana and nuts in the morning to give her body plenty of fuel for the swim.

Fundraising: Pippa's challenges were to raise money for the British Heart Foundation and the Michael Matthews Foundation. She's now auctioning her bike to boost funds

Her hard training and healthy eating paid off as, watched by her parents Carole and Michael Middleton, she completed the gruelling race in one hour and 5 minutes, beating her bushy bearded brother in the process.

He finished in one hour 18 minutes. Pippa joked: 'He said if he'd shaved, he would have beaten me. But of course!'

Pippa said she was delighted to finish the race, coming 577th out of 1,600 participants, 29th female in the 30-34 age category and raising money for charity in the process.

The causes Pippa and her teammates are raising money for are the British Heart Foundation - for whom Pippa is an ambassador - and the Michael Matthews Foundation, a charity set up in memory of a friend of Pippa's who died descending from the summit of Mount Everest at the age of 22.

So far, Pippa and her team have raised more than £20,000 through their epic cycling and swimming challenges, while Pippa has also auctioned her bike on eBay to boost funds.

And rather than putting her feet up, Pippa weekend took to the water again today - this time in a sail boat - to take part in Cowes week.

A glass of milk or a protein shake can aid recovery from a hard workout

Pippa Middleton isn't the only sportswoman who has discovered the benefits of a protein-rich diet to aid her athletic performance.

Sales of protein supplements are on the up and they are no longer just favoured by muscular, gym-obsessed men.

Protein consumption by women is up by 57 per cent, and the market is set to be worth close to £8bn globally, as more women are downing protein shakes after a hard workout.

The supplements are often made from whey - a by-product of cheese production - which can be sold as a powder that can be easily mixed with water for a convenient recovery drink.

Gareth Nicholas from MaxiNutrition, who sell protein supplements, explains: 'Protein is a vital nutrient that your body needs every day as part of a healthy balanced diet, however when you participate in intense physical activity your requirement for protein increases. Consuming protein will support the growth and maintenance of muscle tissue, helping you to support your training goals.'

Aside from such supplements, protein intake can also be upped by incorporating more protein-rich foods into a daily diet. Foods high in protein include fish, chicken, eggs and milk.

Protein is important to aid recovery from exercise as the body uses it to help repair muscles which have been worked hard.

Recovering quickly from exercise is a key aspect of any training plan as it means the body is then prepared for its next work out, lessening the danger of becoming worn-out.
