James Brown's daughter has revealed how growing up watching her father beat her mother led her to accept an abusive relationship as the norm.

While the recent biopic Get On Up focused on the rise of the performer best known as the Godfather of Soul, the Sex Machine and the hardest working man in show-business, Yamma Brown paints a very different picture in her memoir Cold Sweat: My Father James Brown and Me.

The youngest daughter from Brown’s marriage to second wife Deirdre Jenkins, Yamma recalls ‘the whole house shaking with my father’s crazy rage’ when he would lose his temper.

Yamma Brown, the youngest daughter from the Godfather of Soul's second marriage, says seeing domestic violence at a young age led her to accept it in her own marriage for ten years

‘Whenever he’d start, my sister Deanna and I would run for cover, usually in a closet or under our beds, and cry quietly into our cupped hands,’ writes Yamma.

She recalls witnessing one of the terrifying beatings when she was just five years old.

‘My mother was dressed in her blue and white robe. Her legs were splayed wide open and my father was straddling her, pummeling her with clenched fists.

‘Doosh. Thud. Doosh. Thud. Blood spurted from my mother’s face. She started thrashing around, kicking her legs, holding up her arms to ward off the punches and trying to break free, trying to save herself.’

Eventally Yamma’s mom left the singer because she feared he might kill her.

The never didn’t beat his children, but Yamma writes that the ‘damage had already been done’ from growing up seeing what her mom was subjected to.

Brown, pictured with Michael Jackson, was best known as the Godfather of Soul, the Sex Machine and the hardest working man in show-business prior to his death on Christmas Day 2006

‘I’d been programmed to accept abuse as part of life… witnessing my father beating on my mother would have a profound effect on me.’

While working as a pharmacist at DeKalb Medical Center in Atlanta, Yamma met Darren Lumar, a six feet, five inches tall and 280 pound former baseball player turned investment banker.

All seemed to be going well between the couple and Lumar asked Yamma’s father for his daughter’s hand in marriage after they’d been dating for just two months.

The couple moved in together and Yamma writes that she quickly got to see another side of Lumar.

She noticed that he would get jealous and had an angry, aggressive side that she hadn’t previously noticed.

One day when she told Lumar that she was going shopping, he accused her of seeing another man.

When she tried to walk out after he had shouted at her, he followed and even pushed her to the ground outside their apartment building.

Yamma writes that she regrets not walking away from the relationship after that first incident but instead ‘I made the decision to stay with Darren. I loved him.’

Instead she stayed with him for the next ten years during which she says she endured countless beatings.

‘It wasn’t until a decade later, when I was lying on that cold tile floor, with my head pounding and my vision blurred from being punched in the face, that I finally saw my marriage with absolute clarity, and I knew it was over.

I’m not sure what was different about that time. Maybe Darren had finally beaten the pretense out of me, but suddenly after ten years of false hope and make-believe, there was nothing left but the bare and brutal truth.’
