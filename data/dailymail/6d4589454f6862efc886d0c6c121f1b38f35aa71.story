Eddie Lacy ran for a touchdown and caught one of Aaron Rodgers' three TD passes as the Green Bay Packers built a 24-point lead before holding on for a 43-37 victory over the Atlanta Falcons on Monday.

The Packers (10-3) earned their fifth consecutive victory to stay a game up on Detroit in the NFC North. Atlanta dropped to 5-8, but remained in a first-place tie with New Orleans in the woeful NFC South.

'Good victory tonight, our seventh victory at home this year... 10 victories has always been kind of a benchmark,' coach Mike McCarthy said. 'In the NFC, 11 wins will probably be more of a benchmark this year.'

Julio Jones had a career-best 259 yards receiving for the Falcons before leaving with a hip injury. Jones had a 22-yard touchdown catch in a 20-point fourth quarter that helped Atlanta cut into Green Bay's big lead.

Matt Ryan's 2-yard touchdown pass to Harry Douglas with 2:15 left got Atlanta within six.

But the Packers recovered the ensuing onside kick.

Lacy left in the fourth quarter with bruised hip. Backup running back James Starks effectively ended Atlanta's upset hopes with a 41-yard run to the Falcons 6 with 1:37 left.

Atlanta came frustratingly close to a rare victory in Titletown. Green Bay held on for its seventh home win, but the porous pass defense may have given potential playoff foes some hope that Lambeau Field may not be that impenetrable after all.

The Falcons did damage even with Jones hobbling on the sideline, appearing to favor his left side.

Ryan threw for 375 yards and four scores, including a 1-yard touchdown catch by Roddy White with 6:20 left that trimmed Green Bay's lead to 40-30.

Mason Crosby kicked a 53-yard field goal with 4:37 left, helping the Packers withstand Atlanta's final punch.

Rodgers finished 24 of 36 for 327 yards. Lacy had 73 yards on 13 carries, and 33 yards on five catches.
