Every morning Sportsmail brings you the biggest gossip and headlines on the continent, giving you your early morning fix from the biggest leagues across Europe.

The main focus on the continent on Thursday is on the return of the Champions League and how each nation's teams performed in the opening round of fixtures in Europe's elite competition.

First up, Spanish newspaper AS has made an effort to quash the perceived opinion that £60million Real Madrid signing James Rodriguez is somehow lazier than his equally-expensive but departed counterpart Angel di Maria. 

James Rodriguez covered more ground than all Real Madrid players bar Toni Kroos in the 5-1 win over Basle

The paper's front page headline is 'James works it out' due to the fact that only Toni Kroos (11.4km) covered more ground than the Colombian (11.3km) in the Real side during their 5-1 victory over Basle. James also scored in the win.

Marca, meanwhile, leads on 'The 1,000 days that changed Atleti and Spanish football'.

This refers to Diego Simeone's 1,000th day in charge of Atletico Madrid and how he has completely changed the face of La Liga. The paper says Simeone has broken the 'duopoly' of Madrid and Barcelona by claiming five trophies in seven finals to return Atleti back to the Spanish elite.

Mundo Deportivo and Sport focus on Barca's laboured 1-0 victory over APOEL Nicosia at the Nou Camp.

'Decisive' is the headline in Mundo as Gerard Pique's goal gave the Catalans top spot in their Champions League group ahead of Paris Saint-Germain and Ajax.

The French newspaper L'Equipe declare Paris Saint-Germain's 1-1 draw against Ajax in Amsterdam as 'sufficient and insufficient' on their front cover.

Edinson Cavani's goal had put the Ligue 1 champions in front but the paper bemoans their profligacy in front of goal as they missed numerous chances and allowed the Eredivisie winners to equalise.

In Italy, Roma are praised for their brilliant 5-1 victory over CSKA Moscow as they went top of a tricky group group which contains Bayern Munich and Manchester City.

Former Arsenal forward Gervinho netted twice for a side described as 'Mega Roma' by Corriere dello Sport. La Gazetta dello Sport also declared: 'How beautiful you are, Roma'.

However, Tuttosport reveals 'A new Tevez', after the Juventus striker scored his first Champions League goal since his Manchester United days on Tuesday.

The paper claims that Juve coach Massimo Allegri has 'fallen in love' with Carlos Tevez this season.
