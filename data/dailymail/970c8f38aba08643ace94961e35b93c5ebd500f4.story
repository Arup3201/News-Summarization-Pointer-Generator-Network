The Mayor of Rio de Janeiro has admitted that the city's heavily polluted waterways will not be cleaned up in time for next year's sailing events at the Olympic Games.

While bidding to host the 2016 Olympics, the Brazilian city promised a massive clean-up of the Guanabara Bay, which is strewn with sewage and rubbish, so it could be used as a venue. 

But with less than 500 days to go before the opening ceremony, Rio's mayor Eduardo Paes has said in an interview it is likely that conditions in the bay will not change before the Games.

Mr Paes admitted that the clean up was something that they should have been able to achieve in time, adding: 'It is indeed a wasted opportunity.

'As a Rio resident, I think it's a shame. 

As many of Rio's shanty towns are without proper sewers or a reliable waste collection services, tons of rubbish and sewage flows into the bay as well as on to the city's world famous beaches.

In the city's bid to host the 2016 Games, authorities promised a massive cleanup effort that would be an enduring legacy.

Environmental officials have long voiced their skepticism that the bay would be cleaned up on time for the sailing events

But environmental officials have long voiced their skepticism that the bay would be cleaned up on time.

Athletes have also spoke out about the water condition in Guanabara Bay, with many worried about falling ill from the spray from the sewage or colliding with floating rubbish while competing.

However, Olympic officials have continued to insist that the bay will be cleaned in time for the Games, with Mr Paes insisting the sailing events would take part in the cleanest area of the water.

But new pictures have shown household rubbish floating throught the entire bay, including in areas which will be used for the Olympic sailing competition.

Heavy rain in Rio over the weekend exacerbated the problem as wet weather often sees trash and sewage flushed into waterways.

The images also showed an oil slick trailing a boat in the water with Rio's environmental agency saying they would levy a big fine against the vessel's owners.
