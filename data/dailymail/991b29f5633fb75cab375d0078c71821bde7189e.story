One New York City woman got the shock of a lifetime after returning home from a recent vacation.

Nicole Raef, 28, was handed an order of protection from a process server following her return to her boyfriend's home in the Hamptons after a girls weekend in California.

And while she claims this took her completely by surprise, her boyfriend, millionaire investor Brad Zipper, 50, is telling a much different story.

Nowhere to live: Raef was forced to move out of the Hamptons home and NYC townhouse (above) she shared with Raef

'I was 100 percent shocked,' Raef told the New York Post. “

'I was like, "I don’t understand, who breaks up with someone this way?"'

What's worse, having been kicked out of Zipper's Hamptons home and his $4million NYC townhouse, which is located in the city's Little Italy neighborhood, Raef had nowhere to live and even had to resort to pawning her diamond earrings so she could afford a lawyer.

Raef also said that while the two had been arguing before she left, they had worked things out.

Zipper, in papers he filed, paints Raef in a much different light, and implies their relationship was incredibly tumultuous and at times even abusive.

He recalls one incident in which he returned home to find his oven on fire and Raef passed out in the guest room.

'When she woke up, she was delirious and didn’t even remember driving and getting into an accident with my car that night,' he says in the suit.

Her also claims Raef, who works in the fashion industry, threw wine bottles at his head during a party over the summer, and tossed thousands of dollars worth of his possessions into the pool at his South Hampton home. 

Raef’s attorney, Brett Kimmel, has denied all of Zipper's claims.

'This is a wealthy man breaking up with his girlfriend and doing it in a really untasteful way,' said Kimmel.

Prior to the break up, the two enjoyed a jet set life, traveling around the country and even being featured in the New York Times.

That story detailed one of the couple's nights out, having dinner with his parents in the city.
