The Church of England will decide this week whether to approve a law to allow women bishops.

The General Synod will hold a series of votes tomorrow, billed as the most significant decision it has taken since it backed women priests 20 years ago.

The legislation needs a two-thirds majority in all three houses of the General Synod – of bishops, clergy and laity – to win final approval.

A defeat would be seen as a serious blow to Dr Rowan Williams, the outgoing Archbishop of Canterbury, who has been campaigning for a yes vote.

The incoming Archbishop, the Rt Rev Justin Welby, has also urged the General Synod to vote for the legislation, saying that he is ‘deeply committed’ to the cause.

A final vote on approval for the legislation was postponed in July, with bishops asked to reconsider a last-minute amendment which has now been rewritten.

The debate this week is likely to centre on whether it is now acceptable to traditionalists.

Commentators have said they believe it will clear the houses of bishops and clergy with the necessary majority but the vote among lay members of the General Synod is thought to be on a 'knife-edge'.

More than 1,000 members of the Anglican clergy and senior laity have signed an open letter to The Independent urging the General Synod to vote in favour of women bishops in the ballot.

If the legislation clears the final hurdle it will then go for approval in the Houses of Parliament before receiving Royal Assent, paving the way for the first women bishops in 2014.

A code of practice would also have to be drawn up outlining the arrangements to be made for traditionalists who do not accept the authority of a female bishop.

If the legislation fails to clear the final hurdle it would take at least another five years before legislation on women bishops could be considered for final approval before the General Synod.

The first women priests were ordained in 1994 and the Church gave its backing to the principle of women bishops in 2005 and 2006. The legislation has received the backing of 42 out of the 44 Church of England dioceses.

But the Church has struggled to reach a compromise between those campaigning in favour of women bishops and traditionalists threatening a walk-out over the issue.

A final vote on approval for the legislation was postponed in July, with the Church of England bishops asked to reconsider a last-minute amendment amid protests from pro-women campaigners.

The amendment has been rewritten - and the debate is likely to centre on whether this is now acceptable to traditionalists.

Prebendary Rod Thomas, a vicar in Plymouth, and chairman of Reform, the conservative evangelical grouping, and the Rev Canon Simon Killwick, chairman of the Catholic Group in the General Synod, have called for members to vote against giving the legislation final approval.

Mr Thomas said: 'We are urging General Synod members to vote against the draft measure, not to abstain, we are doing so on the grounds that the provision it makes for people like us is completely inadequate for the longer term.

'We know that it is on a knife-edge - we think that, depending on which way the debate goes on the day, there could be enough people to stop the measure going through.'

Martin Dales, spokesman for the Catholic Group in the General Synod, which has around 80 members, said he believed the electronic voting system this time - compared with the use of the lobbies in 1992 - could make a difference.

'The difference here from what happened in the 1990s is that there is electronic voting so you will not be being swayed to jump through lobbies. From what people have told me, people were persuaded to go through particular doors,' he said.

'The voting this time will be done on your own, with your own personal machine. It will not be until a fortnight afterwards that you will be able to see who has done what when the lists are published.'

The Rev Rachel Weir, chairman of the campaigning group Watch (Women and the Church), said they were urging people to vote for the measure.

'We know that it is close and that some people will make up their minds finally on the day, listening to the arguments and going with the sense of what is right, so nobody knows really with any accuracy what is going to happen.

'We really hope that this goes through after all this time.

'Nobody is saying this is a perfect measure, we are not saying "how fantastic, we have got everything we wanted", we are not saying that at all, because it is not true.

'But we have been debating this whole question for 12 years and we really do need to make a decision.'

She added: 'Some, from both sides, want to wait in the hope of getting something better, but to do so would be incredibly destructive.

'Another 10 years going over and over the same arguments would cripple the Church’s credibility and mission. It would also deprive the Church of the skills and wisdom of women bishops. To waste our time and talents in this way would be quite wrong.'
