As Britain continues to bask in the summer sunshine most people will find time to enjoy the balmy weather. But they should spare a thought for one man who must battle against the heat at the end of a 2,500mile run.

Former Navy sailor Sam Boatwright will cover the equivalent of nearly two marathons today - an astonishing feat he has completed every day for the past 49 days.

'I'm setting off earlier in the morning because of the heat,' the 29-year-old told Mail Online.

'Staying motivated throughout each day has been hard, especially when the pain sets in.'

In training: Sam Boatwright has never run in a competitive race before and insists he's not a natural runner

Starting his endurance challenge in Blackpool back on April 6th, Sam has run for nine hours burning every day.

His run has taken him around the whole of Britain's coastline from the Scottish highlands to St Ives in Cornwall, with his trusty white backup van bringing up the rear. However, he reveals that he almost threw in the towel before he had barely started.

'The second day was the toughest ever, he said.

'My body ached from head to toe and was going into shock due to my stupidity on the first day.

'I hadn't eaten and ran with only one break - it nearly broke me. But a message from my brother kept me going.

I also wanted to prove the doubters wrong. Even my own running coach bet against me and this pushed me forwards.'

Now Mr Boatwright has a more sensible eating regime. He starts the day with poached eggs on toast and a cup of coffee and snacks on a flapjack and jelly babies mid morning. Lunch is a wrap or two bananas while dinner tends to be a high-calorie three-course Italian meal. He certainly needs the energy as he is burning up to 6,000 calories a day.

Mr Boatwright said he was inspired to take on the epic run because it was something that hadn't been done in Britain before and he 'wanted to see how much my body and mind could take.'

What make this more surprising is he insists he is not a natural runner at all.

'Last December I was a 14.5st rugby player and I had never run a competitive race in my life,' he said.

'I only ran more than 20 miles for the first time this year.'

Mr Boatwright is using his personal mission to fundraise for the military charity Help for Heroes and hopes to raise £20,000.

'There are ex service men on my rugby team and a couple who are about to go into the army,' he said.

'One thing that has been keeping me going are the messages from wounded service men and women.

'I think about my 50 days of pain then compare it to what they've been going through.

'It always makes me made for myself for moaning so I carry on.'

He said social media had proved a Godsend in providing him with continuous support throughout his 50-day ordeal. The Celebrity comedian John Bishop, who completed his own endurance challenge for Sport Relief, is backing Mr Boatwright on Twitter while his Facebook page has more than 3,000 supporters.

He said during his run he has been struck by the 'kindness of strangers' on the road, from the group of army lads he met in Barnstaple to the countless drivers around the UK who have pulled up and donated money.

'I'm still amazed at people's generosity everyday,' he said on his blog.

'The smiles and cheers have really kept me going.'

To combat the mental exhaustion he broke down the run in his mind into more manageable chunks.

'I broke the time down into smaller goals,' he said.

'First to get a week in, then 10 days, then two weeks, half way and so on. While I try to keep my overall goal in mind but look at each day like I'm going to work.'

Despite undertaking extensive training for the challenge the qualified personal trainer is also experiencing the severe wear and tear of two months hard-graft.

'My feet are a mess, bruised and battered from 50 days on the road' he admitted.

'I have no toe nails and my hip has been crunched and needs ice daily. My left knee has begun to twist and my ankle swells on a daily basis.'

Once he finishes today's run he only has a few more miles to go before he crosses the finish line in his hometown of Skipton in North Yorkshire tomorrow lunchtime.

Remarkably though, Mr Boatwright isn't keen to finish, although he says he is looking forward to seeing his friends and family as well as his dog.

'I feel slightly sad that it's coming to an end,' he said.

'But I know my body needs to rest. If I don't stop soon I will cause long-term damage.'

Then after a pause, the indomitable runner added: 'I can't wait to plan the next one!'
