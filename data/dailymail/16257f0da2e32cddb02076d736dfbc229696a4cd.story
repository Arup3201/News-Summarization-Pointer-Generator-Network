Robert Pires has just come out of retirement to play for Indian side FC Goa, but an Instagram post by his wife Jessica has shown that Arsenal is still at the heart of the family.

Pires was mobbed by an army of Arsenal fans on his arrival in India earlier this week, and his son has now been pictured wearing an Alexis Sanchez shirt while chatting to his father on Skype.

The Frenchman, widely regarded as an Arsenal legend, played 189 times for Arsene Wenger's side between 2000 and 2006, and was a major player in the 'Invincible's team of 2003/04.

He arrived in India on Monday to begin his stint as FC Goa's marquee player, and was in touch with his family on Tuesday to update them on his first 24 hours in his new surroundings.

Pires has come under fire in his home country of France, with media reports suggesting his move is purely money-driven. 

The former Arsenal and Aston Villa man though, denies that is the case. 

‘I always remember what the old boys and coaches used to say when I was young: as long as you can play, keep playing, ‘cos you’ll miss it when it’s over,’ Pires told RMC Sport TV.

'I’m still in good shape so I’m ready for it. Sure, I’ll be earning money, but that’s part and parcel of the world of football.’
