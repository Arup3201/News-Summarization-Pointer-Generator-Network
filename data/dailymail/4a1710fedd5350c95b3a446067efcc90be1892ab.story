His team may have beat the Denver Broncos on Sunday, but Seattle Seahawks star Deshawn Shead had an extra reason to celebrate this weekend.

After beating the Broncos 26-20, the cornerback met his girlfriend, Jessica Martinez, on the CenturyLink Field, where he dropped to one knee on the Seahawks logo.

Surrounded by his teammates,  family and friends, Shead asked Martinez to marry him. She said yes.

Shead then pointed out a message on the scoreboard saying, 'Will you marry me Jessica?' while Bruno Mars' hit 'Marry You' played, KIRO reported.

The happy couple hugged as they were congratulated by friends, family and Shead's teammates.

'Congrats to @dshead24 and his new fiance Jessica!' the Seahawks tweeted. '50 yard line proposal... she said yes. Entire #LOB there to celebrate.'

After the proposal, KIRO-TV anchor and Voice of the Seahawks Steve Raible congratulated the couple on their happy news.

'I was very shocked,' Martinez told him. 'I was actually surprised [when] they started playing our song. I was like, "That's so random honey, they're playing our song!"'

Celebration: Jessica, who has been dating the football star for two years, showed off her ring in another snap

Happy: The couple, pictured earlier this year, planned to celebrate with a dinner of chicken and waffles

Shead added: 'Football is what brought me to Washington, for me to meet her, so I think this is a big part of our relationship.'
