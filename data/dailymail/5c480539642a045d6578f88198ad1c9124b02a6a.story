A frantic husband covered in blood called 911 dispatchers and described his wife's horrific wounds after she was shot in the chest during a struggle over a shotgun.

Timothy Sparks, 58, begged for an ambulance to be dispatched to his home in Mason, Ohio, early yesterday morning when his wife Susan, 56, was shot after she allegedly implied she would kill herself.

Sparks told call handlers his wife suffers from depression, and later said to police he found her in their bedroom pointing a loaded shotgun at her chest around 6:40am.

It is unclear exactly what happened in the struggle. Sparks told police he was holding the gun during the struggle, but did not elaborate as to whether his wife was also holding it, and who pulled the trigger.

The panicked man described how his wife was struggling for breath as handlers instructed him to perform CPR. She was declared dead as soon as an ambulance arrived.

During the 911 call, Sparks said: 'My wife had a gun, the gun went off, my wife, she's been shot.

He continued: 'She had the gun, I was trying to take the gun away from her. I have no idea... I can hear her gulping, gulping, she's gulping.'

Sparks later told police that he was getting ready for work when his wife angled the weapon at her chest and told him: 'It will be better this way'. 

A police report released Tuesday said that he told an officer driving him to the police station that 'he tried to get the shotgun from her but that she had the barrel toward her chest' while sitting on their bed.

Sparks, who said he was recovering from shoulder surgery, allegedly tried to wrest the gun away, but was pulled on top of her.

He said he was holding the weapon, which he did not think was loaded, when it discharged into his wife's chest.

He did not explain whether his wife was also still holding on, or how the trigger was pulled. 

According to local news station WCPO, the pair have been married 33 years and have three sons.

Timothy Sparks was a manager at Chevrolet dealership, and Susan Sparks used to work for Ford, the channel said.

During the 911 call, Sparks was asked to describe her wounds, and said: ''It looks like right in the chest. I tried to take the gun from her she pulled her towards her. She's bleeding from the chest, she's bleeding a lot.'

When asked whether his wife ever seemed suicidal, he said: 'She suffers from depression, she has depression really bad. She would never do this though, she didn't do it on purpose.'

He is asked again whether his wife is bleeding part-way through the 7-minute call, and starts crying when he realizes she isn't. The recording ends when police officers arrived.

Police sergeant Robert Temple said that officers arriving at the house, in the upscale town outside Cincinnati, were met with the sight of Sparks with 'blood on his hands, arms, face and on his clothing'.

Mason Police said they are investigating the fatal shooting 'as a questionable death'.

They say a man was questioning at police headquarters, but did not identify him.
