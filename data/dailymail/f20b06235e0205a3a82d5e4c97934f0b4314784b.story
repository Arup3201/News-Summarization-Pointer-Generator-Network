LeBron James took on former club Miami Heat for the first time since leaving in July as the Cleveland Cavaliers claimed victory in a pre-season game in Rio de Janeiro on Saturday.

The Cavaliers won 122-119 in overtime, with James scoring seven points and picking up eight assists in 20 minutes at the HSBC Arena.

It was the first time James played against the Heat since returning to Ohio after leading his former teammates to two NBA titles in four years.

'For me it was a special moment to be back there competing against my old teammates,' James said. 'I didn't get that awkward feeling, but a lot of memories came back about the things that we accomplished."

James barely talked to his teammates before and during the game, though, doing his usual game routine.

Miami Heat coach Erik Spoelstra was glad the first meeting was finally out of the way.

'If you have to do something like this, I think it really benefits both teams to get the awkwardness out of the way in the preseason,' Spoelstra said. 'There was certainly a level of strangeness to it.'

He said he didn't think it really affected the way the teams approached their preparations, though.

'I think both teams also used this week just to concentrate on themselves,' Spoelstra said. 'We have quite a bit of work to do to get our defense and our continuity offensively together. This was just another step, so in terms of game plan I don't think either team spent a lot of time on that.'
