Mike Page and his wife woke up in their Atlanta home Tuesday morning to find their two-year-old boxer, Brix, was happily gnawing on a bone in the driveway.

When Page went up to see what Brix had in her mouth, he was shocked to find what resembled a human bone.

'It looked like a femur bone, it was a very large bone,' Page told WTXF.

Shortly after, Brix went out and brought home two more similarly eerie finds, leaving one of the bones she brought back on the couch, prompting Page to call police.

An official from the Fulton County Medical Examiner's Office determined the bone found matched that of a human leg bone.

'The medical examiner is saying it looks like from the lower extremity,' said Atlanta Police homicide commander Lt Charles Hampton. 

'It could be a femur. Could be a tibia,' he added. 'Right now, I'm not sure which one.'

Shortly after the confirmation, cadaver dogs scoured the area, finally coming across a human skeleton behind a house nearby, which the medical examiner matched to the remains found earlier.

'Had we not found these initial bones out here, we wouldn’t even be out here right now to find the current remains that we’ve located this afternoon,' Hampton told the Atlanta Journal Constitution.

Discovery: Brix's owner Mike Page said finding his dog with what looked like a human bone was 'disturbing' and said 'there was no flesh on the bone,' indicating it might have been there for a while

'We’re glad we did find the initial bones, and hopefully we can bring some type of closure to the family,' he said.

Police say they don't know how long the remains were there before being found, though they were in an advanced state of decomposition.

Details from Page given to WXIA made it seem like the remains had been there for a long time, as 'there was no flesh on the bone. It was completely dry.' 

They are also in the dark as to the race and sex of the identified body, and though they said there was clothing found nearby, they did not release other details. 

Police are working to check missing persons reports to see if there is a match in police records.
