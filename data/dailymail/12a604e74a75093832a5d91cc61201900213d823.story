Two games, two managers, two defeats, two goals conceded to Kenwyne Jones. The Championship has not been terribly kind to Huddersfield Town in the first steps of this season.

It’s been a strange old week for the Terriers, who seem to have lost a little of their yap, not to mention Mark Robins.

Mark Lillis, the club’s caretaker for a third time in three years, probably put it best when he said ‘losing a manager after one game is a new one for me’.

The circumstances of Robins’ departure are still not terribly clear, except that it followed a 4-0 opening-day defeat against Bournemouth, during which he was loudly jeered by his own fans and felt the players had ‘gone’. The club initially said it was in the ‘interests of all parties’; the chairman, Dean Hoyle, later revealed Robins had, in fact, walked.

The shame for Lillis is that his squad seemed to be walking as well for the first 45 minutes of this fixture. By the time they found their stride they were already two down against a club that would view another Championship season as a failure.

They got better and, more impressively, continued to fight for Lillis after going 3-1 down. But praise is not the same as points, and endeavour is not necessarily a match for a striker like Jones, who is not yet fully fit and has already scored three goals this season.

His scruffy first came on 35 minutes, six after Peter Whittingham’s 30-yard strike put Cardiff in front. Murray Wallace pulled one back in first-half stoppage time before Jones wrapped it up with a powerful drive 10 minutes after the restart.

‘Kenwyne has worked hard this summer,’ said Cardiff manager Ole Gunnar Solskjaer, who subbed off the Trinidadian after 68 minutes. ‘He is still not fit enough to play 90 minutes - we are working on him.’

It seems to be working. Jones was a disappointment after joining last January, scoring only once as they went down.

He remains infuriatingly inconsistent, missing the ball completely when a great chance came his way in the first half. But his power and finishing have been proven over time in the Premier League and, on current evidence, he will thrive at the lower level.

Celebration: Jones jumps in the air after scoring Cardiff's third goal at the Cardiff City Stadium

‘He came to us in January having played not much football,’ Solskjaer said. ‘He played a couple of games on adrenaline and the fitness caught up with him. It is an important season for him.’

The same can be said of Solskjaer. For Huddersfield, the ambitions are lower but no less intense.

‘It’s our third season in the Championship and we want to stay there,’ said Lillis. Things will have to improve under their third manager of the season.
