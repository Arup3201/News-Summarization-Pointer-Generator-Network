A man who killed his wife and dumped her body in the Mississippi River has been convicted of her murder.

The body of Kira Trevino was found in the frozen river two months after her husband Jeffery brutally killed her in their home in St Paul, Minnesota.

Despite police finding the couple’s bedroom covered with blood stains, including a human-shaped mark on the carpet, the jury ruled that Mr Trevino did not intend to kill his 30-year-old wife.

Killer: Jeffrey Trevino, 39, brutally murdered his wife Kira and dumped her body in the Mississippi River

Happy facade: The couple had been married three years and had been experiencing trouble in the relationship when Jeffery brutally murdered Kira in at the home they shared in St. Paul

Scene of the crime: Kira was presumed dead after police officers found the couple's bedroom soaked in blood

Mrs Trevino disappeared on February 21
this year, and her 39-year-old husband joined her family in the search 
for her until her car was found four days later.

The car was parked in a ramp at the Mall of America, where she was co-manager of a clothing store for teenage girls.

According to her mother, the way the car was parked was one which Kira Trevino would not have been able to manoeuvre.

Blood was found on the side of the trunk and the bloodsoaked lining was later discovered nearby.

These
findings prompted investigators to search the couple's home in St. Paul
where officers found several freshly washed towels in a basket next to a
dryer alongside the Arkansas Razorbacks shirt Jeffrey Trevino said he 
wore on February 21 when his wife went missing.

Going
through the house, police also found two bleach-stained towels, a mop, 
bucket and cleaning products. In the master bedroom, detectives came 
across a gory scene, with blood stains around the bed and a large 
human-shaped blood stain on the carpet.

Brutal slaying: Kira Trevino was murdered by her husband in February this year but her body was not uncovered until two months after her tragic death

Together: Kira Trevino moved from Wisconsin with her husband Jeffery to St Paul so that he could find work

In
the bedroom, blood was found on the floor, box spring, mattress, bed 
frame, bookshelf, closet door, baseboard trim and the wall.

Processing
of the home found 'evidence of extensive cleanup efforts,' including 
furniture moved to hide evidence, a spray bottle of bleach solution and a
carpet cleaning machine. A carpet cleaner had what appeared to be blood
and human tissue inside of it.

Based on the amount of blood found in the home, police presume Mrs Trevino dead.

Two months later, her body was found in the Mississippi river.

Prosecutors
alleged Trevino was angry that his wife was having an affair and wanted
a divorce. The defense attorney contended the forensic evidence did not
add up.

Ramsey County Attorney John Choi said he was satisfied with the verdict.

‘The bottom line is we got the conviction. We're very pleased about that,’ Choi said.

He noted the difficulty in getting a conviction in a circumstantial case.

Grieving: Kira Trevino's family, her mother Marcie sister Keri Anne and father Jay Steger said they were pleased with the guilty verdict but wanted a harsher sentence

Loss: Keri Anne Steger is consoled by Ramsey County Victim Advocate Jennifer Mallinger, right, and others outside the Ramsey County Courthouse in St. Paul, Minnesota

Damning evidence: Kira Trevino's car was found outside her workplace at the Mall of America in Bloomington

Steger's
father, Jay Steger, said he was happy with the conviction but unhappy 
Trevino doesn't face more prison time. Prosecutors plan to seek the 
maximum sentence of 20 years in prison.

‘I don't think it's enough,’ Steger, 49, of Marshfield, Wisconsin said.

'‘I feel no matter how much time he gets, it's not enough because it's not bringing my daughter back.’

Defense attorney John Conrad would not say if he plans to appeal

‘Obviously
we're disappointed with the conviction,’ Conrad said. But he noted that
Trevino faces about half the prison sentence he would have faced had he
been convicted of second-degree intentional murder.

In
closing arguments, the prosecution contended Trevino killed Kira Steger
after becoming fed up with her texting a co-worker with whom she was 
having an affair.

But the 
defense questioned whether Steger's marijuana use may have led to her 
death. A bag containing marijuana was found in her purse, but a retired 
St. Paul police sergeant testified it was worth only about $20.

Jay Steger said it was hard to sit through testimony about his daughter's affair and marijuana use.

‘That
devastated me because they (the defense) were trying to attack her 
character and that's not the type of girl she is,’ he said. ‘I think 
it's a tragedy they tried to smear her character ... It was very hard 
for our family to take that all because we know that's not (her).’

Trevino did not testify in his own defense, and his attorney did not call any witnesses.

Sentencing
is scheduled for Nov. 25. Trevino will be held without bail until 
sentencing; he has been jailed on $1 million bail since being charged in
February.
