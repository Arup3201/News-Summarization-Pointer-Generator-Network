Their politically correct holiday card was ridiculed for avoiding the Christmas theme altogether.

But the President and First Lady have finally acknowledged the religious origins of the festival.

Giving his weekly address from Hawaii where the first family are on holiday, the President was joined by Michelle Obama, as the couple wished America a Happy Christmas.

Holiday speech: The President and First Lady have finally acknowledged the religious origins of Christmas

The Obamas were last week mocked for
having sent out a Christmas card, featuring their dog Bo, containing no 
discernible mention of Christmas itself. They also sent out a secular card in 2009.

But sitting next to her husband the First Lady said today: 'It’s a time to 
honor the story of love and redemption that began 2,000 years ago … a 
time to see the world through a child’s eyes and rediscover the magic 
all around us … and a time to give thanks for the gifts that bless us 
every single day.'

The President thanked the armed forces for their contribution saying: 'Giving of ourselves; service to others – that’s what this season is all about.

'For my family and millions of Americans, that’s what Christmas is all about. It reminds us that part of what it means to love God is to love one another, to be our brother’s keeper and our sister’s keeper.'

Of course, in line with his domination of White House Christmas festivities so far, Bo the White House dog got an honourable mention.

Obama had opened his speech saying, 
'As you gather with family and friends this weekend, Michelle, Malia, 
Sasha and I – and of course Bo – want to wish you all Merry Christmas 
and Happy Holidays.'

His first full day on vacation got off to a good start with the news that approval rating jumped one per cent to 44 per cent, his highest since early July, gallup.com reports. His lowest point in the last year was 38 per cent on October 15-17.

The president started his delayed Christmas vacation in Hawaii last night after 
securing an agreement to extend payroll tax cuts into 2012.

He had planned to start his vacation on December 17, but delayed
his departure amid a congressional stalemate. 
Michelle Obama and daughters Malia and Sasha, have been in Hawaii for 
about a week.

The first family enjoyed a low-key Christmas Eve out of the spotlight.

The president spent his first morning in Hawaii at a multimillion-dollar vacation home his family rents in the Kailua Beach area, near Honolulu. He skipped his standard early morning gym workout, and headed to the golf course later Saturday.

First lady Michelle Obama, meanwhile, got into the Christmas spirit by helping track Santa for NORAD. The North American Aerospace Defense Command has been telling anxious children about Santa's whereabouts every year since 1955.

The White House said Mrs. Obama answered several calls from children around the country who wanted to know how close Santa was to their homes.

The Obamas are expected to stay in Hawaii, the state where the president was born and mostly raised, until early January.

The White House says Obama has no public events scheduled during his trip.

A small team of White House advisers is traveling with the president to brief him on domestic and international developments.

The President boarded Air Force One on
Friday afternoon to begin a round-trip journey that will cost taxpayers
an astronomical $3,271,611.

First Lady Michelle took their children last weekend in a flight that cost an extra $100,000 - and her husband’s round-trip journey will be $3,271,611.

The bill for the trip went up last week when Mrs Obama decided to take Sasha and Malia herself while Mr Obama tried to save the U.S. economy.

His flight was estimated by the Hawaii 
Reporter as the largest expense of the holiday trip, which will cost 
more than $4million in total.

The U.S. Air Force calculates it costs $181,757 per flight hour to operate Air Force One.

Travel time direct from Washington D.C. to Hawaii is about nine hours, which gives a total of $3,271,611 there and back.

Additionally, the cost for a USAF C-17 cargo aircraft is required to carry Presidential limos, helicopters and other equipment.

Flight
time between Andrews Air Force Base and Hawaii is a 21.5 hours return, with 
estimated operating cost of $12,000 per hour, a GAO report said.

A
four-to-six member Marine Corps unit is on a separate flight for extra 
security, at an estimated cost of $258,000 - not including their hotel 
costs.

According to the White House Dossier, 
Mrs Obama’s early trip to Hawaii cost about $100,000 including travel, 
security and personnel.

It is thought the accommodation costs run to $151,200.

The family covers the cost of a private beach front residence in Kailua, Oahu, for the holiday, which costs up to $3,500 a day, or $75,000 a month.

But taxpayers take care of housing for Secret Service, Coast Guard and Navy Seals who guard the rentals and arrive a day ahead of Mr Obama.

That is about $21,600 per home for approximately seven houses rented for 18 days. There is also a hotel bill for $72,216.

The President’s staff and White House Press Corps are staying at the Moana Surfrider, which costs from $177 to $450 based on the time of year.

Excluding tax, meals and other charges at
the more conservative rate, that amounts to more than $72,216 for 
approximately 24 members of staff.

Then there's the local taxpayer costs of $260,000. The overtime for local police in Oahu is expected to cost taxpayers $250,000.

A city spokesman said an ambulance that travels with the president at all hours will cost an additional $10,000.

Several costs are unknown and will not be released by the White House, citing security reasons.

Some
include security upgrades, additional phone lines, bullet proof glass, 
car rentals, fuel, travel costs for staff travelling ahead of the 
President.

The estimated cost for a 17-day round trip for a Hawaii holiday for the President, his family, staff and security is $4,113,038.

A spokesman for the White House told the Hawaii Reporter that the costs are 'in line' with other presidential vacations.
