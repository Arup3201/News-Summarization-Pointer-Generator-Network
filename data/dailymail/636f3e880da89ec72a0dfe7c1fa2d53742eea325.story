British hostage John Cantlie believes 'two-thirds' of what he is saying in propaganda videos released by Islamic State, according to his sister.

The photojournalist, who was kidnapped by jihadists nearly two years ago, has been shown in a series of videos recently in which he speaks about ISIS, and criticises both the UK and U.S. governments over their strategies to deal with the terrorists.

Mr Cantlie, who wears an orange jumpsuit and appears to be reading from prepared scripts, has said it is true that he is a prisoner but claimed he had been abandoned by the government.

Jessica Cantlie said her brother John was a 'very principled man' , and she understands how he feels

His sister Jessica, who issued a video plea to his captors last week to renew contact with her family, believes some of her brother's words reflect his views.

She told the Sunday Times: 'He believes at least two-thirds of what he is saying. He's a very principled man.'

She added that she understands his feelings of abandonment. 

Referring to his captors she said: 'I'm never going to be an apologist for who they are now. But these people, all of them, have suffered a huge injustice.'

Ms Cantlie pleaded with her brother's captors to renew contact with her family saying the 'channels are open'

Ms Cantlie, whose father Paul spoke earlier this month from his hospital bed to appeal for his son's release, said her family last received evidence the freelance journalist was alive at Christmas which was 'the most fantastic' present. 

The next they heard of him was in the first IS video released last month.

She said her family 'really, really need to hear' from her brother's captors, saying: 'The channels are open. If they cannot access [the existing] channel, please set up a new one, because we are trying to communicate.'
