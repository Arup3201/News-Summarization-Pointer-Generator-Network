The senior manager of a cleaning firm who worked at Heathrow airport hanged himself after hearing his job was under threat.

Keith Stone, 50, was found hanging from an aircraft de-icing vehicle near Terminal 5 - just yards from the runway where passengers were taking off and landing.

An operations manager for cleaning firm Aircraft Service International Group (ASIG), Mr Stone was very concerned that he would have to re-apply for his job following cuts at the firm.

Keith Stone, 50, was worried about losing his job after hearing the news two weeks before Christmas. Police are not treating his death as suspicious

He ran teams of cleaners subcontracted by airlines and was told the news two weeks before Christmas, The Sun said.

Friends said he was worried about the possibility of losing his job and feared he wouldn't be able to support his family.

A colleague told the newspaper: 'The prospect of financial woes proved too much.'

Mr Stone, who had worked for the firm for 23 years, had emailed bosses last Wednesday explaining his concerns before taking his life that day.

Detectives at Scotland Yard said Mr Stone's death was 'non-suspicious'.

An ASIG spokesman said: 'Keith's commitment, professionalism and good humour will be sorely missed.'
