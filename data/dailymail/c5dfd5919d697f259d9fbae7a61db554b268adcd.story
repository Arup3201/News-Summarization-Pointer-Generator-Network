The Wolves were taking part in their first competitive match since Malanda's death due to Germany's lengthy winter break.

The home side took the lead after just four minutes when Bast Dost netted an early opener past Manuel Neuer after latching on to a pass from De Bruyne.

Dost doubled the scoreline shortly before the interval by hitting a beautifully-struck shot which nestled in Neuer's goal after clipping the woodwork.

De Bruyne looked to the sky after scoring his side's third in the 53rd minute before Juan Bernat pulled one back for the Bundesliga champions. 

The Belgium international ensured his side claimed all three points by grabbing his second goal of the match with 17 minutes left on the clock.
