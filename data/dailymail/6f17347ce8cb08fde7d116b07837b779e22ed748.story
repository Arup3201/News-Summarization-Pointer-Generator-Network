Spill all: Anna Gristina, pictured, says she will name names in a tell-all book

The infamous mother-of-four who admitted to running a prostitution ring in New York has vowed to spill the names of her Johns in a tell-all memoir.

Scot Anna Gristina also revealed that football fans will be particularly interested in the contents of her little black book.

The 44-year-old spoke after a brief court hearing in Manhattan today where she got the OK to fly to Los Angeles to appear on the talkshow 'Dr Phil.'

'I will be' naming names, Gristina told the New York Daily News.

When asked for a teaser of the calibre of Johns her prostitution ring catered to, she said, grinning: 'Let's just say if you like football (you'll be interested).'

She is also set to reveal details of her 15 year career as a pimp during her Dr Phil appearance, which is due for filming next Wednesday and Thursday to be aired about a week later.

'There is going to be a giant name dropped - actually, a couple of them,' Gristina told The New York Post, referring to her upcoming interview.

When the newspaper asked if the names would be 'giant' with a capital 'G,' the mother gave a mischievous laugh before promoting the show and specifying who in the world of football might be in the firing line.

'Everyone's going to have to watch Dr Phil,' she said.

'I will tell you that one of the names is high-level (NFL) management. Then there's an older (football) player who's still very well known. Tune in to Dr Phil!'

Gristina was sentenced to six months in jail followed by five years probation on November 20.

She has previously boasted of a plentiful supply of well-to-do customers.

Last month, U.S. prosecutors said the Edinburgh, Scotland, native who lives in Monroe, New York, had been the madam of a Manhattan sex service for 15 years.

The mother first claimed she ran a 
dating service, but later admitted to the single charge of promoting 
prostitution as part of a plea deal at Manhattan Supreme Court on 
September 26.

When Acting Supreme Court Justice Juan Merchan asked Gristina if she had anything to say in court after the sentencing, she replied: 'It's probably better that I don't, Your Honor.'

As well as the jail term and probation, the woman may be deported as a result of her conviction.

Her sentence stems from an incident in July 2011 when authorities say Gristina set up a rendezvous between two female prostitutes and an undercover police officer posing as a client.

Prosecutors from the Manhattan District Attorney's office caught her on tape arranging for the officer to watch the two prostitutes have sex in her E. 78th St. brothel.

Gristina was arrested in February as she was leaving a fundraising meeting for her business, prosecutors said.

She spent nearly four months in jail on Riker's Island and was released in June on a $250,000 US dollar (£157,000) bond.

Prosecutors said their five-year investigation revealed that Gristina netted an estimated $10 million (£6.4 million) from her business, which was said to include a roster of wealthy clients.

Despite her plea, she insists she never crossed the
 line, and blames her friends and alleged accomplice Janie Mae Baker for
 turning on her.

'Sometimes people get great deals for being state's witnesses, for 
being rats,' her defense attorney Norman Pattis said in court on Tuesday. 'I think in 
this case Ms. Baker decide to flip and roll over to get a deal.'

Pattis said Gristina had entertained the thought of recanting her plea in favor of going to trial.

Gristina resides with her family on a 12-acre property in Monroe, which is about 50 miles (80km) north of New York City.

She previously spent time helping abandoned pet pigs find new homes, her lawyers said.

She housed any number that were unwanted and kept them as pets, they said.

Gristina told friends and family members
 in Scotland that she worked in internet marketing and had a sideline 
gig as a real estate agent.

Over the years neighbours reported black chauffeur-driven limos dropping off clients at all times of the day and night. Gristina's employees reportedly included many Playboy and Penthouse models.

'There is nothing glamorous about prostitution,' Erin Duggan of the
 Manhattan District Attorney’s office said in a written statement.

'Anna Gristina rented women's 
bodies for profit, which makes her a pimp. That also makes her a felon, 
and the court has now issued that judgment.'

Gristina's husband, Kelvin Gorr, said there was a 'sense of relief that it's over.'

'This was in the best interest of the kids, just 
to start over and move on,' he said.

To
 her friends and neighbours, she was simply a homely American housewife 
and mother of four, with a soft spot for animals. Pigs, in particular, 
were her passion and at her suburban home outside New York she housed 
any number that were unwanted and kept them as pets.

She
 explained, when asked by her friends and the family she had long left 
behind in Scotland, that she worked in internet marketing and had a 
sideline as an estate agent.

In
 truth, say prosecutors, she was the madam of a high-end brothel in 
Manhattan that netted her $10 million (£6.4 million) over 15 years.
