A Good Samaritan driving back from her own birthday party was killed by a pickup truck that hit her when she pulled up to help a stranded motorist.

Tammy Rhoades, 45, was fatally hit in Conroe, Texas, by the vehicle of Tyler Shelton, 21, which was travelling behind her and failed to stop.

She had pulled up and put on her flashing lights when the car in front of her, driven by William Ramirez, 23, got a flat tyre on Interstate 45.

Family: Ms Rhoades with her daughter Stefanie, who is now 19

The victim's daughter has spoken of 
her shock at the death of her mother, just hours after the two had 
talked on the phone to celebrate Ms Rhoades's birthday.

Stefanie Rhoades told KHOU: 'My mom didn’t have to die on her birthday. I shouldn’t have to prepare her funeral. It’s not right.'

She added: 'He's not a few years older than me and he just took my mom away.'

Gay Schiappa, the victim's mother, said: 'I hate to think about it.'

Mangled: The huge impact saw her car's front number plate imprinted on Mr Ramirez's back bumper and her floor pan and seats fell through her vehicle

‘The rear end of the car that was initially struck - the fatality - had damage that you can’t even recognise what kind of car it is,’ cop Robert Engle said.

‘The rear end of the car was all the way to the centre post of the four-door car,’ the officer said of Rhoades’s destroyed Pontiac Grand Am.

Mr Ramirez, of Huntsville, Texas, was in his Toyota car on an overpass on Monday at 9:35pm when he got a flat tyre and stopped to try to fix it.

He stopped in a moving lane because he could not get off the road, police said. Ms Rhoades pulled up behind and put on her flashing lights.

But Shelton’s Chevrolet pickup truck travelling behind ploughed straight into her car, pushing it forward into the Toyota vehicle, reported KHOU.

The impact saw her car’s front number plate imprinted on Mr Ramirez’s back bumper and her floor pan and seats fell through her vehicle.

Shelton claimed to police that a white pickup had crashed into her car and then sped off. But evidence of paint chips suggested it was his pickup.

Shelton, of Willis, Texas, was charged with intoxication manslaughter and booked into a county jail on a $50,000 bond.

‘Don’t stop to fix your flat - just tear up the wheel of your car and keep moving until you can get off the freeway please,’ Officer Engle told KHOU.
