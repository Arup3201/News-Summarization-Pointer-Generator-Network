Manchester City manager Manuel Pellegrini has not ruled out keeping Frank Lampard at the Etihad Stadium beyond the terms of his loan from sister club New York City FC.

Lampard is due to head to the MLS in January but an equalising goal against former club Chelsea at the weekend and two more in the 7-0 Capital One Cup rout of Sheffield Wednesday have pointed to the 36-year-old's value to City.

Lampard's night took a turn for the peculiar when a pitch invader managed to grab a 'selfie' photograph with the former England star in the centre circle with the game still going on.

Frank Lampard scored twice in 7-0 defeat of Sheffield Wednesday in the Capital One Cup third round 

Lampard also scored against Chelsea in the Premier League last weekend, although he didn't celebrate

But talk turned more serious after the game when Pellegrini was asked about keeping Lampard for the whole season.

'It is an issue that we will see further down the line,' said the City manager.

'We will see what happens in January and we have two or three months to decide.

'He deserves all the praise he can get from the fans.

'We will do what is best for the team and the player.

A fans also ran on to the pitch to take a selfie with the former Chelsea man, he was then taken away by police

'We must talk about a lot of things, but it is not impossible for him to stay here.'

After a scoreless first half, Lampard scored three minutes in the second period before winning a penalty on the hour and scoring again in injury time.

Asked about the incident with the fan, Pellegrini said: 'He deserved the hug.

'He is a star in England and I'm very happy for him.

'For me, it is never difficult to put good players in the team. The problem is when you don't have the players.

'He is a very important player for our team and maybe, at 36, he cannot play three games in a row. But Frank is a top player.'

Manuel Pellegrini said that Lampard could possibly stay with the club beyond January
