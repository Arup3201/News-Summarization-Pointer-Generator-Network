The well-to-do heroin addicts who were arrested for allegedly keeping explosives in their Greenwich Village apartment were reportedly planning to blow up the arch in nearby Washington Square Park.

Friends allegedly told police that Aaron Greene, who was arrested along with his then-pregnant girlfriend Morgan Gliedman, had previously tested explosives in the Manhattan public park.

The friend's report that Greene was seen sprinkling powder on the ground before throwing rocks at it to see if it would explode is in keeping with police theories that the couple were stocking up on highly unstable explosives in order to stage an attack.

Free on bail: Morgan Gliedman, who went into labor last week as police handcuffed her for allegedly keeping explosives in her apartment, leaves Manhattan Criminal Court with her lawyer on Tuesday

The New York Times reports that police interviewed Daniel Whittaker, a friend of Greene's who lives in upstate New York.

Mr Whittaker, who is a corrections officer, was questioned because Greene told investigators that he had given some weapons to 'a friend in law enforcement'.

The main focus of the investigation, however, has been the apartment that Greene and Gliedman lived while she was pregnant with their child. Gliedman, 27, went into labor during her arrest and because she stopped doing heroin during her pregnancy, the child was born drug free.

Inside the apartment, officers found 
seven grams of the explosive powder HMTD, which was reportedly the 
substance used in the 2005 London Underground bombings.

Target: Greene was allegedly seen sprinkling powder around the arch in Washington Square and watching it explode

Dangerous: The NYPD bomb squad was called in to remove the explosive that was discovered in the couple Greenwich Village apartment

The building had to be evacuated while the bomb squad removed the highly-unstable explosive.

Police
 also found a sawed-off Mossberg 500, a $1,000 Ruger over-under hunting 
shotgun, several high-capacity magazines, 60 shotgun shells, and a 
replica of an M203 grenade launcher.

Several disturbing items were seized, 
including: 'The Terroristâ€™s Encyclopedia V. 1.02,' 'Improvised and 
Modified Firearms: Deadly Homemade Weapons,' 'A Do-It-Yourself 
Submachine Gun,' and U.S. Army manuals for creating and planting booby 
traps and explosives.

Officers
 were tipped off about the explosives by someone who met Gliedman and 
Greene, 31, in Washington Square Park. The couple invited the informant to 
their apartment to take a shower, which is when he spotted the weapons, The Post reported.

'Junkies': Morgan Gliedman, 27, and Aaron 
Greene, 31, are both admitted heroin addicts - even though Gliedman was 
heavily pregnant when the explosives were found at their apartment, 
police say

The
 apartment on Manhattan's West Ninth Street is near the apartment where
 two rich young men accidentally blew themselves up while making a bomb 
for the extremist group the Weather Underground in 1970.

Greene
 and Gliedman had no such plans, police sources are saying. They are 
just wealthy drug addicts with a twisted idea of what's 'cool,' 
according to the Daily Beast.

Friends revealed to the New York Post
 that Gliedman, a former student of New York prep school Dalton, was on a
 safe track to success until she met Greene, who has a series of felony 
weapons charges to his name.

New mom: Gliedman displays her bump as she attends court. She has not seen her daughter since the birth

Moving on: She was ordered to wear a monitoring ankle bracelet and to go to rehab

Rehab-bound: Gliedman was whisked away to a mandatory 30-day treatment program

She went to New York University and then attended the Art Institute of Chicago for a masters in Creative Writing.

'She
 comes from a great family, raised on Park Avenue, went to a great 
school, but then this guy introduced her to drugs,' a friend told the 
Post.

They added that Gliedman stopped doing heroin when she learned she was pregnant, and the baby was born drug-free.

The newborn, named Melody Sunshine, is now being cared for by
 Gliedman's mother, Susyn Schops Gliedman, a broker, and father, Dr. 
Paul Gliedman, head of radiation oncology at Beth Israel Brooklyn.

When Gleidman is released from the treatment program, she will allowed to travel throughout Manhattan and Brooklyn, said celebrity bail bondsman Ira Judelson, who posted Gliedman's bail.

'She wants to get clean. She wants to address this legal issue. She wants to raise her daughter,' he added.

Gliedman will be back in court on January 29 on the weapons charges and unrelated theft charges.

Following
 the arrest, it emerged that the 27-year-old was already a suspect in a 
robbery - and already on probation for drug possession.

Posh: Gliedman attended one of New York's premier prep schools and was raised on the exclusive Park Avenue

Prominent parents: Gleidman's father is Dr Paul 
Gleidman, the director of radiation oncology at Beth Israel Hospital's 
Brooklyn division. Her mother is Susyn Schops Gliedman, a top New York 
real estate agent

On February 17, Gliedman met a man at
 Johnny's Bar in the Village and went to his Midtown apartment where she
 allegedly took off with a backpack containing his laptop, cellphone, 
wallet and credit cards, which she used to make purchases.

Five days after the robbery, on 
February 22, she and her Harvard-graduate boyfriend, Greene, were 
arrested for possession drugs and found with a .223-caliber rifle.

The
 couple were spotted with another woman in a car and Greene was seen 
injecting heroin while one of the women snorted the drug, a criminal 
complaint said.

Police 
officers found empty heroin bags on the floor, marijuana and a digital 
scale with heroin residue in one of the women's handbags, according to 
The Post, and Greene admitted to having a gun.

He was sentenced to five months in 
jail. Gliedman was due to complete pre-trial probation for drug 
possession this week, but that case now could be reopened because of the latest explosive find.

Greene's
 father is the head of a top art restoration firm. He was also arrested 
in the apartment on Saturday and is being held without bail on Rikers 
Island.
