They say an Englishman’s home is his castle – but billionaire businessman John Caudwell seems more intent on building an urban palace.

For the mobile phone tycoon plans to turn two mansions in one of the most upmarket parts of London into a single dwelling the size of Westminster Cathedral.

An ‘iceberg’ extension will be created by excavating beneath the existing properties to make space for a vast games room, swimming pool, sauna, kitchen, salon, media room, plant room and car park.

It will be about 180ft long, stretching under each house and joining  them beneath their gardens, which back on to each other in Mayfair. The result will be a massive single property of some 50,000 sq ft – a normal town house is about 4,500 to 8,000 sq ft, while other  mansions in Mayfair are from 10,000 sq ft. The ‘iceberg’ extension alone will cover 14,000 sq ft.

Once complete, the mega-mansion will have 12 bedrooms – there are five in each house already and the plans include two more in the underground extension.

With property prices for super-prime homes in Mayfair at around £5,000 per sq ft, the finished home  could be worth £250million.

Mr Caudwell, 61, who is worth £1.5billion, bought the two properties last year for a total of £81 million and has submitted his plans to Westminster Council.

The bigger of the two houses, built in 1877, is Grade II listed. At 22,000 sq ft, it has marble floors and a ballroom thought to be the largest of its type outside the Crown Estate.

Extension: The new lower ground floor will feature a games room, kitchen, pool, sauna, changing room, media room, plant room and a car lift

In the 1960s it was a members club and, according to its history, was frequented by ‘dubious  gangland characters’, footballers and celebrities. It was bought  by Prince Jefri, brother of the Sultan of Brunei, in 1992 for a reported £18million.

He spent millions decorating it and sold  it to an investment group a  decade later.

Mr Caudwell grew up in a working-class background in Stoke-on-Trent and was a second-hand car dealer before forming Phones4u, which he sold in 2006 for £1.5billion. He is thought to be Britain’s highest income-tax payer, personally contributing more than £200million over the past five years.

Yesterday a statement on behalf of Mr Caudwell said: ‘The new works are intended to reinstate its quality and make it a fitting Mayfair house.

‘The application... makes  significant efforts to correct  poor alterations and to reinstate elements of heritable significance. Mr Caudwell is also seeking minor alterations to the roof and the construction of an orangery.’

Iceberg homes, a trend among the super-rich, involve digging down below ground to create more space than traditional extensions. But they are controversial because of the inconvenience they can cause to neighbours during the building work.

Mr Caudwell, who is divorced and lives with long-term partner Claire Johnson, may have a battle to get his plans approved.

The annual number of iceberg extension applications in Westminster has more than doubled from 79 in 2008/09 to 181 in 2011/12 and local government chiefs are threatening a crackdown.

Robert Davis, Conservative deputy leader of Westminster council, said recently: ‘It is about restricting developments akin to the decks of a nuclear submarine that are too large and cause real disruption for our residents.’

But leading Mayfair estate agent Peter Wetherell said: ‘It’s wonderful news that one of the biggest investors in Mayfair is British and the plans should be applauded. Some complain about iceberg homes because of the amount of work involved but there is also a lot of work when building new homes.

‘It is catching up with modern-day living and they are going to be restoring one of Mayfair’s finest homes.’

With prime real estate in London's most upmarket areas in short supply and going for an enormous premium, the capital's billionnarires are increasingly going underground in their bid for a bigger house. 

The likes of Andrew Lloyd Webber, Nicole Kidman and Roman Abramovich have all extended underground. 

In the past the majority of homeowners have extended upwards over fears of causing permanent structural damage. 

But the trend for so-called 'iceberg homes' is growing. 

Ten years ago, the number of planning applications for basement extensions in Kensington and Chelsea was just 64. 

Last year, the number had soared to 307. 

However, extending underground comes at a premium. 

In August, multi-millionaire hedge fund manager Reade Griffith was order to pay £800,000 to create a huge two-storey underground basement below his two adjoining Kensington townhouses.

He received the unprecedented levy from Kensington and Chelsea Council when he was granted planning permission for the extension, which houses a swimming pool, spa and 'treatment area'. 

One-off levies are not the only downside to extending underground. 

Goldman Sachs director Christoph Stanger had to apologise to his furious neighbours in Kensington last summer after his £1million basement excavation — built to fit a playroom, guest room, gym, wine cellar and cinema into his £7 million house — left cracks in neighbours' properties. 

However, despite the issues, the wealthy continue to dig underground. 

Estate agents Our Property says: 'The main reason basement conversions are really growing in popularity is because, unlike loft conversions, basements are normally closer to other communal areas and can be more versatile living spaces that suit modern lifestyles, not just extra bedrooms, bathrooms or studies.'
