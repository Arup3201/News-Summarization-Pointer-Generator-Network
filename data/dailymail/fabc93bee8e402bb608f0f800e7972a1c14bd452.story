They never found his body in the cloying, blood-drenched mud of the Somme.

But nearly a century after a young soldier died fighting for king and country, he is about to see service again.

Private William Tickle, who lied about his age to join the Army at just 15, is to be immortalised on a Royal Mail stamp bearing his image.

Private William Cecil 'Billie' Tickle is to be commemorated on a stamp marking the centenary of the First World War

His photograph will form part of a five-year commemoration of the First World War, honouring the millions of ordinary people who gave their lives for freedom or answered the patriotic call.

The stamp – first class, of course – is one of a series being issued ahead of the centenary of the outbreak of war this summer.

It uses a portrait of the private in uniform, donated decades ago by his proud mother to the Imperial War Museum so he would not be forgotten.

The picture was taken a few days before he was killed and originally bore her poignant, handwritten note beneath: ‘Billie Boy … One of the very best.’

Had she not labelled it so, few would surely remember the name of a young man whose sacrifice echoed that made by so many in ‘the war to end all wars’.

William Cecil Tickle was only 15 when he signed up, convincing recruiting officers he was 18.

He lived with his family in Hornsey, Middlesex, and joined the Essex Regiment in September 1914.

By the time the 9th Battalion was mobilised in France the following spring, the keen young infantryman would have found himself in the company of countless ‘boy soldiers’ who signed up as teenagers.

Over the top: Around 1million soldiers were killed or wounded during the battle, 350,000 of them from the UK

They landed in Boulogne on May 31 and instantly found themselves thrust into battle.

After three months they would also fight in the Battle of Loos, among the biggest confrontations of the campaign, in which 16,000 died and 25,000 were wounded among British troops alone.

The regiment fought heroically in the Somme, a landscape stripped bare by artillery, tanks and ferocious fighting.

Perhaps unsurprisingly for a Tommy named Tickle, the private still managed a smile. In the last photograph of him, sent home to his mother, he is beaming with pride.

Shortly after she received it, in July 1916, Private 13510 Tickle was killed in a charge against German lines at Ovillers. Like scores of others, his body was swallowed by the mud and never traced.

Elizabeth Tickle never got over the loss of her beloved son but was determined he should be remembered.

In 1920 she answered an appeal for photographs of the fallen and it eventually became part of an exhibition in honour of the dead.

‘I should like to feel I can tell my friends that he is there with all his comrades,’ she wrote at the time. ‘He was only a boy but, God love him, he well did his duty.’

Now his image will appear next to the Queen’s head in a series that will also include stamps to commemorate war artists, and the role of women and civilians, among others.

The stamps will be issued each year to 2018, starting in July.
