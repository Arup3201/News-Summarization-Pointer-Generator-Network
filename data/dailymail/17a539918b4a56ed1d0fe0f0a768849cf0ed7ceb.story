An extraordinary letter in which Admiral Lord Nelson launches a racist rant at his arch enemy, the French, has sold for 9,000 pounds.

The four page letter was written in the aftermath of the 1799 Battle of the Nile, where the Royal Navy hero defeated Napoleon's fleet off Egypt.

In his broadside, Nelson blasts the French as being a nation of 'thieves, murderers, oppressors and infidels' and admits to not liking any Frenchman.

Rant: Lord Nelson describes the French as 'thieves, murderers, oppressors and infidels' before questioning 'what faith can we hold with these people?'

He also attacks the French republican system as a 'many-headed monster' and said their problems would be resolved if they had a monarchy.

The letter is signed 'Your obliged Bronte Nelson', a signature used by the sea lord after being made Duke of Bronte in Sicily in 1799.

It has now sold at auction in London for a four figure sum.

Auctioneer Richard Davie, of International Autograph Auctions, said: 'It is a fascinating letter revealing personal views of our greatest sea lord.

'There has always been a rivalry between Britain and France, but Nelson was writing at a time when relationships between the two countries were at rock bottom.'

After the Battle of the Nile, Nelson sailed to Palermo, Italy, from where he wrote the letter.It is unclear who the letter was for, although it was addressed to 'My Dear Lord.'

He states: 'I hate rebels, I hate traitors, I hate tyranny come from where it will.

'I have seen much of the world, and I have learnt from experience to hate and detest republics.

'There is nothing but tyranny & oppression, I have never known a good act done by a Republican, it is contrary to his character under the mask of Liberty.

'He is a tyrant, a many headed monster that devours your happiness and property.

'Nothing is free from this monster's grasp. A republic has no affection for its subjects.

'A King may be ill advised and act wrong, a Republic never acts right, for a knot of villains support each other, and together they do what no single person dare attempt.

'I pray God this war was over and a monarch placed on the throne of France, not that I like any Frenchman be he royalist or be he republican, but the French republicans have shown themselves such villains.

'I form not my opinion My Dear Lord from others, no it is from what I have seen.

The letter was written following the Battle of the Nile when relationships with the French were at rock bottom

'They are thieves, murderers, oppressors and infidels, therefore what faith can we hold with these people.'

Nelson left Palermo to return to Britain in 1800 and took part in several military campaigns before his most famous hour, the Battle of Trafalgar in 1805.

Once again Nelson masterminded the British and defeated Napoleon's forces, but was fatally wounded in battle.
