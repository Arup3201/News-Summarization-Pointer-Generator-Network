Host commentator

91mins: Barry sends a free-kick into the area as Everton look for a late equaliser but Granqvist clears his lines well. 

88mins: Krasnodar are in total control here as Gethin Jones replaces Browning. 

85mins: Browning looks to push forward before passing the ball onto Barry. The ball is worked to Long on the left of the Krasnodar penalty area, but his shot is tame and saved easily by Sinitsin.  

80mins: Garbutt sends Long chasing a loose ball as Sigurdsson flies in a concedes a free-kick. Garbutt sends the resulting set piece onto the head of Kone but the forward can only send it high and wide. 

78mins: Chris Long replace McAleny.  

73mins: The goal scorer Laborde is replaced by Burmistrov.

72mins: Krasnodar should be 2-0 ahead as chance come and go for both Joaozinho and Izmailov. The former found himself one-on-one with Robles, but played the ball back rather than going for goal. Izmailov then scuffs his shot just wide. 

68mins: At one end, Kone jinks his way through the Krasnodar defence brilliantly before losing out before Izmailov's long range effort is blocked. 

64mins: 17-year-old Dowell almost had his big moment after being played into the penalty area by Oviedo. Just as the youngster pulls the trigger is shot is blocked and cleared for a corner. 

59mins: Pienaar is shown a yellow card for a late challenge on Pereyra. Laborde sends the resulting 30-yard free-kick well over the bar. 

54mins: The ball squirms through Kone is the box before falling to Oviedo, but the returning full back is unable to connect. 

Elliott Bretland: On first vieweing it appeared the away end was empty but I'm reliably informed there are 14 Krasnodar fans who have made the trip for this dead-rubber. (I can just make them out from the press box, dotted around the corner of the Bullens Road) Dedication!

49mins: Robles is forced into action once again by Laborde, who hits a low shot across the tall keeper. At the other end, Kone fires a shot towards the top corner which Sinitsin beats away. 

47mins: The Toffees haven't started very and it's the away side who look to maintain possession. Garbutt, however, continues his impressive evening by claiming the ball and winning an Everton throw from the left. 

We're back underway at Goodison Park. The result may matter very little, but Martinez will want his young players to put down a marker in front of a home crowd. 

There goes the whistle as we reach the break at Goodison Park. Impressive stuff from Krasnodar, who lead thanks to a Laborde goal.

43mins: Kone, who has been impressive so far, is shown a yellow card for a slight elbow on  Kaleshin. Looks to be a very harsh booking as the replay shows Kone just shielding the ball. 

41mins: Garbutt and Pienaar link well down the left as a piece of skill from the youngsters earns his side a corner. The set piece is cleared.

37mins: McAleny has a chance to lead a breakout on the right but gives the ball away far to easily in the centre circle. Very quiet at Goodison as the away knock the ball around confidently.  

Elliott Bretland: Left back Luke Garbutt has certainly been taking tips from Leighton Baines at Finch Farm.

The 21-year-old gathered the ball off Steven Pienaar before going on a lung-busting run before his cross was locked by the Krasnodar defender.

Impressive running by the defender.

The away side may have nothing to play for but they have taken the lead at Goodison Park. Laborde races through on goal and just when it looks as though Joel has it covered, the Colombian forward turns and knocks the ball past the keepr's front post. 

Elliott Bretland: Arouna Kone has looked sharp in the opening fifteen minutes. Just before the quarter of an hour mark the Ivorian sensed an opportunity as space opened up in front of him from about 20 yards out.

The Everton No 9 let fly only to be denied by Krasnodar keeper Andrei Sinitsin who made a smart save down to his right.

A bright start from the former Wigan forward.

24mins: Krasnodar enjoy their first spell of pressure which culminates in a deflected shot from Laborde which sails out for a corner.   

Dominic King: All very quiet here so far. Little zip to the game, muted enthusiasm from a sparse crowd. That said, it will be interesting to see how Kieran Dowell and Ryan Ledson fare in this contest.

Roberto Martinez holds both players in high regard and was anxious to reward their progress with a game. Neither player looks short of confidence.

14mins: Kone looks desperate to get off the mark tonight. The frontman hits a powerful strike from 20-yards out which is beaten away by Krasnodar keeper.  

Elliott Bretland: The rain is battering down at Goodison Park here tonight as an Everton fringe side look to complete the Toffees' Group H campaign unbeaten.

Returning from a nightmare 15 months on the sidelines, can Arouna Kone, playing as the lone frontman, score his first Everton goal?

11mins: Huge blow for Atsu who is forced off with what looks to be a hamstring injury. Atsu's loss is Dowell's gain, however, as the youngster comes on for his debut. 

Not much to tell you about from the opening seven minutes of this game.

Just a word, though, on the travelling support. Krasnodar have brought 14 fans with them from southern Russia, and Everton have provided them with hospitality for the evening...

The teams are out at Goodison Park and we are underway. Everton are in their traditional blue shirts with white shorts while the visitors are wearing white with black shorts.

As mentioned earlier, Everton have already won Group H and therefore this match means very little to them. Back to back victories in match day four and five against Wolfsburg and Lille have taken them to 11 points from five games and they are still unbeaten.

Krasnodar cannot qualify tonight as they sit bottom of the table with three points. The best they can hope for is to earn their first win of the group stage and finish third ahead of Lille, who take on Wolfsburg.

The teams drew 1-1 when they met in Russia in October.

Here is the side that Roberto Martinez has selected tonight:

Everton: Robles, Browning, Alcaraz, Barry, Garbutt, Ledson, Oviedo, McAleny, Pienaar, Atsu, Kone

Elliott Bretland is at Goodison Park. He says: 'The thinking before the game was that right back Tyias Browning or left back Luke Garbutt may have been played at centre back but instead Roberto Martinez has plumped for Gareth Barry alongside Antolin Alcaraz. Good to see Browning and Garbutt starting in their natural positions. '

Kick-off coming up at 8:05pm

It's all change for Roberto Martinez against Krasnodar tonight with Everton's progression to the knock-out rounds of the Europa League already secure.

The Toffees take on their Russian opposition at Goodison Park having won the group with a game to spare. Nevertheless, tonight will be a chance for some of the fringe players and upcoming talent to shine, and team news is on the way very shortly...

Follow Sportmail's live coverage of the Europa League Group H clash between Everton and Krasnodar.

With his side already qualified and guaranteed top spot, Roberto Martinez had the opportunity to blood some youngsters with the likes of Tyias Browning and Luke Garbutt featuring. 

Unfortunately for the young Toffees, a Ricardo Laborde strike in the first half was enough for three points at Goodison Park.
