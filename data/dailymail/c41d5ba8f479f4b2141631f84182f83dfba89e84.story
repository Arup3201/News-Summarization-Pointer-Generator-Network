For a man of 72 who’s survived 55 years in showbusiness – albeit without a great deal of over-indulgence – Sir Cliff Richard does a pretty good job of looking half his age.

And here he is doing it all over again as he waits at Barbados Airport in jeans and a check shirt, cuffs fashionably folded back just the once.

So perhaps the singer can be forgiven for the odd inconsistency in the battle to hold back time.

His hair was a great deal darker than it was a few months ago – changing from auburn to its current shade of deep brown.

The singer admits he has his hair coloured, saying: ‘I said to my hairdresser, “Every time I lift my hair up I can see grey. Will you colour it for me?” It doesn’t show up in photos, so it’s just for my own vanity.’

He has put his youthful looks down to a strict diet and exercise, as well as avoiding drink and drugs.

Sir Cliff might like to share some of his beauty secrets with an ex TV co-star.

Olivia Newton-John, 62, who guested several times on his show It’s Cliff Richard in the 1970s, looks to have resorted to Botox to defy the years, leaving her face wrinkle-free but rather bloated as she appears on tonight’s Jonathan Ross show to promote her first UK tour for decades.
