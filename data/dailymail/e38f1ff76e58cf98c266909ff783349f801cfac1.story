Liverpool will consider a January move for West Bromwich Albion striker Saido Berahino.

The England Under 21 international starlet has been targeted by Tottenham Hotspur and there has been a £15million offer mooted by the north London club.

That falls ways short of the price which would persuade West Brom to sell.

Brendan Rodgers' Liverpool are after Berahino but West Brom will want at least £25million for him

The Baggies believe Berahino is worth in excess of £25m, and Liverpool’s potential interest could see a bidding battle with Spurs.

It is already recognised in Liverpool circles that the signing of Mario Balotelli is a gamble which has not worked. But the Reds will find it hard to 'move on' Balotelli in the January transfer window.

Even if they can’t, the club are set to move for a new striker, with Behahino now high on the list. 

Swansea’s Wilfried Bony - a Spurs target last summer - is another option for the Reds.

Tony Pulis is being lined up as Harry Redknapp's successor at QPR as pressure grows on the boss

Mon: Adel Taarabt makes Harry Redknapp’s accusation that he’s not playing for QPR because he is three stone overweight look rather foolish by getting his shirt off for the lads and revealing a washboard-looking stomach. If only we could all be that overweight, eh?

Tue: While Manuel Pellegrini had a point complaining about the 'behind closed doors' farce in Moscow, he was really deflecting from another poor display by Manchester City in the Champions League. They surrendered a two-goal lead which leaves their hopes of progressing hanging by a thread.

Wed: Arsenal display great spirit by winning their Champions League game against Anderlecht that had seemed lost until the last few minutes. It could be a sign that the Gunners have that bit extra to go along in Europe this season given the Premier League title already seems beyond them.

Thurs: Tottenham’s Erik Lamela comes good at last with a wonder goal in the Europa League. But it still remains to be seen whether he produces such magic in the Premier League (see Libero)

Fri: Ahead of 'El Clasico', Luis Suarez snaps after being asked about the incident which caused his ban then storms out of a press conference. Why is Suarez so, er, bitter?

Tony Pulis is being lined up as Harry Redknapp’s successor at Queens Park Rangers.

The word on the grapevine is that Redknapp may only have two games to save his job.

That process starts on Monday night at Loftus Road when QPR take on Aston Villa. They face Chelsea next weekend, too.

It has been perceived that if Redknapp is ousted then Glenn Hoddle, whom he brought in as coach, would take over. 

Indeed that was one plan.

Hoddle could well be asked to hold the fort in the short term should Redknapp go and the emergency engagement could evolve.

Tim Sherwood would also come in to the equation as a successor given his close relationship with Les Ferdinand, who is now Head of Football Operations at the club.

But Football Grapevine sources say club owner Tony Fernandes may well see Pulis as the best man to lead Rangers to safety just as he did at Crystal Palace last season.

Winston Reid wants £60,000-a-week to sign a new contract at West Ham.

The club are reluctant to raise their most recent offer of about £45,000-a-week.

But given Reid’s contribution to the club’s excellent start to the season, West Ham may cede to his demands - especially with his contract expiring at the end of the season.

Roy Hodgson is considering giving Tottenham’s England Under 21 striker Harry Kane a call up for the Euro 2016 qualifier against Slovenia and the friendly versus Scotland next month.

Hammers boss Sam Allaydyce has let it be known to Hodgson that he feels Stewart Downing is worthy of a recall to the England set up.

Manchester City are considering challenging neighbours Manchester United and Arsenal for Real Madrid’s Sami Khedira in January.

Sportsmail had previously reported that Carlo Ancelotti will attempt to block any move to buy Khedira this January, but Real Madrid will overrule their coach if the offer comes close to their £10million valuation of the player whose contract runs out at the end of the season.

Although Sam Allardyce has turned the team and his fortunes around at West Ham thus far - not least in the eyes of co-owner David Sullivan - the club will not be rushing into talks over a new contract. 

Allardyce’s current reputed £2.7million-a-year deal expires next summer.

By the way...

Opinion seems divided as to whether Mario Balotelli was wrong to swap shirts at half-time when Liverpool were getting their shirts stuffed by Real Madrid last week.

For what it is worth I think he was wrong, showing no respect for his team mates, the fans, the badge and indeed the idea of competitive sport where the shirt is a symbol of the team ethic.

It seems to me the time has come for the football authorities to act on this issue so there is no debate.

If a player can be shown a yellow card for ripping off his shirt as part of a goal celebration, then swapping shirts at any point during a match should be a red card offence.

Following Manchester City’s defeat at West Ham, Chelsea can forge ahead in the title race at Old Trafford on Sunday.

That is why Jose Mourinho may now instruct his team to go for the kill and win, rather than seek a draw.

A Chelsea win is 6/4. I fancy Coral's offer of 12/1 for a 2-0 Blues win.

Tottenham’s Erik Lamela caused a bit of a stir last week with a bit of maverick magic in scoring a 'wonder goal' for Tottenham in their Europa Cup win over Astreas Trioplis.

It’s easy to see why many fans got so excited but it did seem some top professionals went over the top in their praise.

Indeed one ex-pro striker I know, while admiring the technique, questioned whether Lamela would have been able to pull off that bit of showboating against anything other than low grade opposition.

'If it had been 0-0 in a cup final and one chance come along would he do it then? Can you imagine if you got it wrong, fell over and the chance went and the game was lost?,' my pal asked.

Harsh? A bit of jealousy even? Maybe.

Anyway, as we all know now the technical term for a reverse scissor kick is actually a 'rabona'.

And here is the definition:

A method of kicking the football with the kicking leg wrapped around the back of the standing leg, so it appears the player has their legs crossed.

The first reported rabona happened in a league game in Argentina in 1948 and was performed by Ricardo Infante.

Soon after, a magazine front cover featured Infante dressed as a pupil with the caption 'Infante played hooky'; rabona means to skip school in Spanish.

Diego Maradona, Roberto Baggio, Gianfranco Zola and Paul Gascoigne are among the players who have performed a successful rabona during a game.

There are those who argue that had George Best signed for Chelsea in the early Seventies his career would have been re-booted and the success the Blues had winning the FA Cup then European Cup Winners Cup with swagger would have been sustained.

As it was Chelsea, like 'Bestie', lost their way.

That said, Best did appear for Chelsea in Peter Osgood’s testimonial in 1975.

And his two goals in that game prompted then-Blues manager Eddie McCreadie to try and sign Best, who at the time was playing for Fourth Division Stockport 'on licence' from United.

Stockport were paying Best, who was just 29, £300 a week, which was more than the weekly wages of most players in the then First Division.

When Chelsea approached Best he asked for £1,000 a week - a staggering sum back in the day.

Blues chairman Brian Mears refused.

A year later Best would sign for Fulham and for a season or so his career alongside Rodney Marsh enjoyed a revival before he ended up show-boating in the United States.

One can only imagine though what it would have been like on and off the pitch had Best teamed up with Osgood and Alan Hudson sooner.

The picture above conjures up thoughts.
