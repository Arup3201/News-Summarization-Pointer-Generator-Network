More than 300 friends and family were invited to an African-themed birthday bash at Windsor Castle to mark Prince William's 21st. But palace officials have announced that the Duke of Cambridge will be keeping celebrations 'low-key' and 'private' as he turns 30 tomorrow.

It has been rumoured that his wife Kate, who marked the milestone in 
January, was planning a party to remember and had enlisted the help of friend and London club owner Guy Pelly.

But it seems it will not be a raucous affair, and only a few of the Duke's close friends will attend what is likely to be a private dinner at his residence in Anglesey, North Wales.

William has been busy on a course 
connected with his work as an RAF Search and Rescue Force pilot since 
the extended Jubilee Bank Holiday weekend, but he will now take time out.

A St James’s Palace spokesperson would 
not give any details about how the Duke will celebrate his birthday only
saying 'He’ll be spending it in a low-key, private fashion'.

The Duchess of Cambridge  is almost certainly to be behind any events that are planned, 
and also has the tricky job of finding a present for her husband.

Prince Harry has often joked that his brother William has become decidedly middle-aged since his wedding to Kate Middleton last year.

The Royal couple are said to prefer 
nights in front of the TV watching their favourite DVDs and eating 
home-cooked meals at their Anglesey home rather than enjoying a night on
the tiles.

William’s 30th birthday is an important milestone for the royal who could one day be King.

The Duke has matured into a dependable, confident and respected member of the Royal family. As well as a happily married man he is also forging ahead with his RAF
career, and earlier this month it was announced the royal had qualified
as an operational Captain meaning he can now command RAF Sea King helicopters 
during rescue missions.

The birthday also comes during the 
Queen’s Diamond Jubilee year which has seen her receive the adulation of
the country during national celebrations.

William and Kate joined the Queen in 
Nottingham last week for a tour marking her 60-year reign, a visit which
saw thousands of well-wishers flood into the city.

Although second in line to the throne, 
behind his father the Prince of Wales, the Duke will be required to step
up his royal commitments as he plays a more high profile role for the 
monarchy as the Queen advances in age.

He
has already undertaken royal tours in her name and during the past 12 months he has been thrust into the spotlight more than ever before.

When he turned 21 William summed up his personal goals, telling media: 'My guiding principles in life are to be honest, genuine, thoughtful and caring.'
