A four-year-old girl has been found distraught and dehydrated after she was left inside a hot school bus for several hours in Victoria's west.

A statement on behalf of the driver from Bus Association Victoria  says the service collected the girl from her home however upon dropping her to kindergarten the driver 'couldn't locate the child.'

He says he then parked at the bus depot and performed a routine check of the vehicle before leaving at approximately 9am. 

The four-year-old should have been dropped to Warracknabeal Memorial Kindergarten on Tuesday morning

The girl's parents only learnt of her absence upon arriving at the school to collect her at about 1:30pm Tuesday afternoon.

Unable to find their daughter they contacted the bus company and the police. 

The driver was contacted by the bus company and was the first to the scene. He says he found the child in the bus 'in good spirits and well'.

'This is a terribly unfortunately circumstance. The child may have been asleep under the seat - but we're unsure,' says the statement.  

The bus driver alleges a parent of the child physically assaulted him at the depot causing him to be visibly shaken. The police confirmed they attended an incident at Warracknabeal bus depot where two men were involved in a 'scuffle'. 

Police were called to the scene however the investigation is ongoing and no charges have been laid. 

Warracknabeal was 'lucky' to be experiencing mild weather on Tuesday unlike the hot day that claimed the life of a 22-month-old child in February

Yarriambiack Shire Council chief executive Ray Campling told the ABC it's lucky the girl got out unscathed however if it was much hotter she may have been seriously hurt.

Noah Krespanis was found unconscious and was unable to be revived

'The little girl either fell asleep at the back or just slipped down between the seats and unfortunately she was left in the bus for a few hours,' he said.

'It's a sad case, but if anything it's a reasonable outcome for what could have been a drastic outcome.'

This comes less than two weeks from when a 22-month-old boy was found dead after being left inside a hot car at Kyneton, just north of Melbourne.

Noah Krespanis was found in a car parked outside a home on Acacia Drive in Kyneton in 31 degree heat.

The car window was smashed in order to rescue Noah but attempts to revive him were unsuccessful.

It's been reported that temperatures would have reached up to 60 degrees inside the car on the hot Summer day.

Public Transport Victoria are investigating the bus provider Annascott Pty Ltd who is contracted to provide the Willenbrina to Warrackanbeal service.

The operator says they consider this a very serious matter and will co-operate fully with the authorities.

Ambulance Victoria were called in to help at least six young children locked in hot cars in separate incidents during February, and a total of 200 children in the first five weeks of 2015
