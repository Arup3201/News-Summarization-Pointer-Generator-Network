A 55-year-old man was found dead on Monday hanging from the framework of a huge artificial 'New Year tree' in central Kiev today which has become a symbol of anti-government resistance, Ukrainian police said.

Police said they removed the body, which was hanging inside the cone-shaped tubular steel construction on Kiev's Independence Square. The 'tree' is festooned with a poster of jailed opposition leader Yulia Tymoshenko and scrawled with graffiti attacking President Viktor Yanukovich.

The body, that of a man from Volyn region in western Ukraine, bore no external wounds and was being examined to establish the cause of death, the police statement said.

The incident was especially bizarre since the square has been swarming with protesters day and night since the onset of mass protests against Yanukovich in early December.

The discovery came as Ukraine's embattled justice minister threatened to call for a state of emergency following the seizure of her ministry building by anti-government protestors last night.

Yesterday a man was found dead hanging from Independence Square protest 'tree' in Kiev. The 'new year tree' has become a symbol of pro-EU and anti-government protests

President Viktor Yanukovych has also offered an amnesty to imprisoned demonstrators if activists cease their occupation of central Kiev

Azarov's departure will be welcomed by the activists, as he was a particular target of anti-government hatred

Standing guard: Demonstrators stand guard at the entrance to the Justice Ministry, which became the fourth government building to be occupied during the protests, but was quickly abandoned after the justice minister threatened to declare a state of emergency

Violent: Hundreds of protestors burst into the building on Sunday night. They erected a number of barricades, before burning a portrait of President Viktor Yanukovych

Elena Lukash said she would also halt
 negotiations with demonstrators if they refused to leave the building, 
situated just several hundred metres away from the main protest camp in 
central Kiev.

The government has since said it has no immediate plans to declare a state of emergency after protesters evacuated the building.

Although
 the building's seizure ended, it underlined protesters' growing 
inclination to take radical action after two months of largely peaceful 
demonstrations. Long-brewing anger boiled over into violence a week ago 
when protesters launched into clashes with police, infuriated by harsh 
new anti-protest laws hurriedly pushed through by President Viktor 
Yanukovych.

Three 
protesters died in the clashes last week, two of whom were shot by 
hunting rifles, which police insist they do not use. With protesters now
 willing to risk injury, a state of emergency would be likely to set off
 substantial fighting on the streets of the capital.

"Today, such a measure is not on the table," Foreign Minister Leonid Kozhara told journalists.

Action: Speaking to a local TV crew, Ms Lukash said the 'so-called protesters' had seized the building as ministry employees were working on measures to grant amnesty to protesters. Above, demonstrators pull a public bin to be used in the construction of barricades

Seized: Staff had also been attempting to make changes in the constitution, she said. Above, three anti-government protesters stand guard at the ministry with icons

EU
 foreign police chief Catherine Ashton said in a statement that she was 
alarmed by reports about the government considering a state of emergency
 and warned that such a move "would trigger a further downward spiral 
for Ukraine which would benefit no one."

Ashton,
 who is set to travel to Ukraine Tuesday, called for a dialogue and 
urged the opposition leaders to dissociate themselves from those who 
resort to violence.

The
 protesters still occupy three sizable buildings in downtown Kiev, 
including City Hall. One of the buildings was seized in a spectacular 
assault early Sunday, when hundreds of protesters threw rocks and 
firebombs into the building where about 200 police were sheltering. The 
crowd eventually formed a corridor through which the police left.

Lukash,
 in a televised statement, noted that protesters seized the building as 
justice employees were working on measures to grant amnesty to 
protesters and to make changes in the constitution to restore more power
 to the prime minister.

Yanukovych
 on Saturday offered the prime minister's post to Arseniy Yatsenyuk, one
 of the opposition's most prominent leaders. Yatsenyuk, while not flatly
 rejecting the offer, said protests would continue and that a special 
session of parliament called for Tuesday would be "judgment day."

Demonstrations: Beleaguered President Viktor Yanukovych offered the prime minister's post to Arseniy Yatsenyuk on Saturday, which he declined

Chaos: President Yanukovych also offered former boxer Vitali Klitschko, another opposition leader, the role of Deputy Prime Minister. Above, protestors face riot police

Upcoming 'judgement day': Mr Yatsenyuk said protests would continue and that a special session of parliament called for Tuesday would be 'judgement day'

t's
 not clear if constitutional changes will be on the agenda for that 
session, but granting more power to the prime minister could both 
sweeten the offer and allow Yanukovych to portray himself as offering 
genuine compromise.

The
 fears of a state of emergency come after other official statements 
suggesting the government is considering forceful moves against the 
protesters.

Interior Minister Vitali Zakharchenko, an official 
deeply despised by the protesters, on Saturday warned that demonstrators
 occupying buildings would be considered extremists and that force would
 be used against them if necessary.

He also claimed demonstrators had seized two policemen and tortured them before letting them go, which the opposition denied.

The
 protests began in late November when Yanukovych shelved a long-awaited 
agreement to deepen ties with the 28-nation European Union and sought a 
bailout loan from Russia. The demonstrations grew in size and intensity 
after police violently dispersed two gatherings. Demonstrators then set 
up a large tent camp on Kiev's main square.

After
 Yanukovych approved the new anti-protest laws, demonstrations spread 
into other parts of the country, including to some cities in the 
Russian-speaking east, the base of Yanukovych's support.

A city in flames: The president's announcement came as fresh violence erupted in Kiev, with a large crowd attacking a government exposition and conference hall

Danger: Demonstrators were throwing firebombs into the Ukrainian House building and setting off fireworks - to which police responded with tear gas

Deal: President Yanukovych has offered the role of Prime Minister to Arseniy Yatsenyuk (left) with fellow opposition leader Vitali Klitschko (right) as his deputy.

Concern: Today's prospect of a state of emergency also follows other official statements suggesting the government is considering forceful moves against the protesters in the wake of the violent clashes. Three protesters have now died in the protests - two of them after being shot and one of unspecified injuries

Fire: A demostrator walks near burning tyres during an anti-government protest in downtown Kiev. The protest movement is reportedly now spreading beyond the capital

Prayers: An orthodox priest stands between between police and protestors at the scene of anti-government demonstrations near Dynamo Stadium in Kiev

Protesters have occupied Kiev's city hall for nearly two months and turned it into a makeshift dormitory and headquarters. The government claims they are holding two police officers hostage

Fortifications: The protests began in late November when President Yanukovych shelved a long-awaited agreement to deepen ties with the European Union

Spread: Protests have now spread into other parts of the country, including to some cities in the Russian-speaking east, the base of Yanukovych's support
