It was meant to be the moment when Kenyan Wilson Kipsang relished in glory after setting a new world record when he incredibly ran the Berlin marathon in two hours, three minutes and 23 seconds.

But he was not the only person that day who wanted a slice of the action. 

The long distance runner was pipped to the line by an intruder wearing a T-shirt promoting a website for prostitutes. 

Attention seeker: The man in yellow spoiled Wilson Kipsang's moment when he crossed the line before him

The man in yellow ran the final few yards with Kipsang to promote the site that matches prostitutes with 'gentlemen with high demands'. 

Despite trying to claim the glory, nothing can detract from the fact that Kipsang sliced 15 seconds of the previous world record.

The 31-year-old clocked a time of two hours, three minutes, 23 seconds to better the previous mark set by Patrick Makau two years ago.

Fellow Kenyans Eliud Kipchoge (2:04:05) and Geoffrey Kipsang (2:06:26) finished second and third respectively.

Wilson Kipsang set a new world record when finished the marathon 15 seconds ahead of the previous best time. But his finish line moment was ruined by an intruder in yellow promoting a site for prostitutes

Makau was not competing in the event after withdrawing two weeks ago with a knee injury.

Kipsang competed in his first Olympics in London last year, where he finished third. 

Speaking after the race, he said: 'I'm very happy that I have won and broken the world record.

'I was really inspired by [fellow Kenyan] Paul Tergat when he broke the world record here 10 years ago and I'm very happy that I was in a position to break the record on the same course.'
