Rivaling all things Ebola-related for the title of most tasteless Halloween costume this year is an outbreak of ill-advised Ray Rice-themed ensembles – a shocking number of which feature the wearers proudly posing in blackface.

Ex-Ravens running back Rice, 27, was suspended indefinitely by the NFL after unseen footage surfaced of him knocking his then fiancée unconscious during an argument in an Atlantic City elevator in February.

After dominating the national media for several days in September, the incident has now inspired a rash of ill-advised Halloween costumes.

Not content with blackface, this man also sports an Afro wig and his daughter comments '#mydadsbetterthanyours'

The first photos of such a costume emerged last week via Reddit and showed an unidentified male wearing Rice’s #27 jersey and holding a black blowup doll by the hair in reference to the brutal incident.

'Ladies were falling for my friends Ray Rice costume,' wrote Redditor AL0311.

While commenters in the Reddit forum were largely accepting of the costume, it prompted a hail of criticism elsewhere and was described as 'sick,' 'despicable' and 'contemptuous.' 

Rice’s wife Janay tweeted her dismay at the costume on Wednesday. 'It’s sad, that my suffering amuses others,' she tweeted.

As if dressing up to glorify an act of domestic abuse wasn’t tasteless enough, other photos have emerged since showing like-minded costume-wearers ‘inspired’ by Rice – a shocking number of whom couldn't resist the urge to take the sick stunt to another level and parade around in blackface.

The shocking selection of photos have prompted highly critical comments from people disgusted at that in 2014 there are people who think that domestic abuse and blackface are funny

One photo showing a couple dressed as Ray and Janay Rice was shared by ESPN commentator Keith Olbermann with his half a million followers. The couple's son's, who took the offending photo, has since deleted his Instagram account. 

Other photos to have emerged show one person sporting an Afro wig along with their blackface attire. The daughter of the man in the photo comments '#mydadsbetterthanyours', while she has received a number of critical remarks from people appalled by the man's behavior.

Another photo shows a young child posing with a plastic doll representing Janay Rice.

One mother has even posted a photo showing her as Janay Rice with a black eye and is tagged with #domesticviolenceisnotfunny #butmycostumewas.

The shocking selection of photos have prompted highly critical comments from people disgusted at that in 2014 there are people who think that domestic abuse and blackface are funny. 

Rice was suspended for two games from the NFL after the incident; after full video of the assault leaked, however, he was suspended indefinitely and cut by the Baltimore Ravens.

The couple married shortly after the incident and Janay has spoken publicly in support of her husband. Ray Rice is currently in the process of appealing his indefinite suspension.
