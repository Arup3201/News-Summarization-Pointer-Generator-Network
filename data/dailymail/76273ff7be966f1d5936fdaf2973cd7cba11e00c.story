If you thought that a bullet could never be beautiful you might need to think again.

An American photographer has taken a series of close up photographs of bullet holes which look uncannily like the most beautiful galaxies.

Deborah Bay, from Houston, Texas, created her collection, The Big Bang, by getting firearms experts at Houston Community College to fire bullets at Plexiglas – a lightweight, shatter-proof alternative to glass.

She then used macro-photography to capture images of the bullets lodged in the Plexiglas as a way of looking at the tension between the destructive nature of weapons and the fragile beauty of the damage they create.

The result was a collection of images which she says show ‘the jewel-like beauty and the inherent destructiveness of the fragmented projectiles’.

‘When you think about the impact of the bullet hitting an animal or a person or whatever it’s intended to hit there is just the push and pull in the pictures of the beauty versus the horror,’ Ms Bay told Wired.

To get the close-up shots, the photographer sometimes had to combine multiple images of the same bullet hole in order to get enough depth of field.

The colours visible in the images come from minerals in the gunpowder, and from coloured lights and gels Ms Bay uses in her studio.

Ms Bay, who is fascinated with weapons and their inescapable role in American culture, says on her website: ‘I began thinking about The Big Bang after seeing a sales display of bullet-proof Plexiglas with projectiles embedded in it.

‘The plexiglas captured the fragmentation of the bullets and provided a visual record of the energy released on impact.’

She added: ‘Many of the images resemble exploding galaxies, and visions of intergalactic bling sublimate the horror of bullets meeting muscle and bone.

‘My interest in the project stems from America’s long-held affection for guns as part of its heritage.

‘This seems particularly relevant in Texas which has an estimated 51 million firearms – two guns for every man, woman and child in the state.

‘The photographic images were made in the studio – well after the gunshots were fired.’
