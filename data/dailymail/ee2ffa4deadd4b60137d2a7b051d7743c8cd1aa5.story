Ministers have ordered a shake-up of the honours system amid fury that Mo Farah did not get a knighthood and Jimmy Savile cannot be stripped of his.

No 10 is irritated that Farah, who won two golds at the London Olympics, did not get a knighthood, while Kelly Holmes, who won two track golds at the 2004 Athens Games, became a Dame.

Civil servants have told ministers that he could not get a top honour since he did not have an MBE already.

Archaic rules mean Jimmy Savile, branded a serial paedophile by a recent police report, cannot be stripped of his knighthood posthumously

Arcane rules mean Sir Jimmy Savile, branded a paedophile by a police report, cannot be stripped of his gong after death.

Ministers have intervened to demand new rights to bypass the civil service after it emerged that more mandarins got gongs this year than Olympians, with just 68 British athletes receiving honours compared to 124 civil servants and quangocrats.

It is understood that at a Cabinet meeting before Christmas, ministers agreed to seize control of the honours system.

Tories are amazed that the civil servant
at the Department of Education who is responsible for picking those who
get honours was himself granted an gong this year. Honours Secretary 
Darryl Cooper was granted an MBE in the New Year's Honours.

A senior Whitehall source said: 'This isn't even gongs for the boys, it's gongs for the boys who hand out the gongs.'

A No 10 source added: ‘Of course we wanted Mo Farah to get a knighthood but they get very sniffy about the rules. There is all this stuff about having a small one first and working your way up. The  public would be mystified.’

Other ministers, like Tory Chairman 
Grant Shapps, have grown irritated with the system when civil mandarins 
repeatedly rejected their nominees without providing any explanation.

'Grant kept putting forward officials
who have helped push through important reforms but there was radio 
silence. He eventually learned that civil service bosses were selecting 
people who were retiring instead. He forced this issue and both people 
got gongs. We're seeing a change,' the source added.

The shake-up has been ordered after anger that figures such as Mo Farah didn't get a knighthood in this year's honours list

Ministers are reported to have been angry at arcane rules which allowed Kelly Holmes to be a Dame after winning two gold medals in 2004 but Mo Farah wasn't knighted for his achievements this summer

Under the plans, ministers would get the
right to bypass the laborious selection process, where civil servants 
weed out the nominees, and send their suggestions straight to the 
relevant honours committee, which are now staffed by experts as well as 
civil servants.

If mandarins reject the suggestions 
they will have to provide a full explanation in writing to the minister,
dissuading them from simply rewarding their own rather than people who 
command public support.

A senior Government source said: 'What 
we've seen in recent years is a complete civil service takeover of the 
honours system which have cut politicians out. It started as a reaction 
to the Blair years but there is now a realisation that it has gone far 
too far.

'We have replaced political control of 
the honours system with control exercised by unelected and unaccountable
bureaucrats.'

The plans for change have been fed into Sir Bob Kerslake,
the head of the civil service, is conducting 'quinquennial review' of 
the system, which is due to be sent to Buckingham Palace for approval 
this Spring.

He has accepted that ministers have the 
right to feedback but is resisting calls for them to bypass the civil 
service bureaucracy on the grounds that this would politicise the 
system.

A civil service source defended the 
mandarins, pointing out that honours for domestic civil servants and 
quangocrats account for just one in 11 gongs. When diplomats and members
of the Armed Forces are thrown in, 18 per cent of honours go to public 
servants.

'The vast majority are people who do charity or voluntary work, often in their local communities.

'We reject the criticism that the 
government hand out gongs to people for long service. All honours are 
given to people on their own individual merits. There is no rubber 
stamping.'

Plans for change have been passed to civil service chief Sir Bob Kerslake, who is conducting a review.
