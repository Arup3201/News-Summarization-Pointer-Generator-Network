A 22-year-old man tried to use his own five-month-old son as a human shield in a police shootout, officers said.

Joseph Gonzales emptied his handgun into the windshield of a patrol car and sped around San Pedro, California, with his baby in the back seat in a deadly chase early Saturday morning, according to detectives.

Officers from Long Beach Police Department were called to a domestic dispute at the suspect's home while he was out with the child around 3am.

'Human shield': Joseph Gonzales allegedly threatened to use his five-month-old child, pictured above, as a human 

'Shootout': Officer told how Gonzales exchanged several rounds of fire with officers. The above handgun was found in his car

Shots fired: Gonzales allegedly unloaded his handgun into the windshield of this patrol car. He has been booked for attempted murder, among other felonies

He was on his way back at the time, and reportedly called ahead threatening to shoot members of his own family, as well as police officers when he got back, Fox Los Angeles reported.

A police spokesman said: 'He specifically stated he would harm the baby and use him as a shield against police.'

He then allegedly pulled up in his SUV, opened fire, then fled with his son still in the car.

Gonzales then drove from Long Beach to San Pedro - around 15 miles - before police said he exchanged more rounds of gunfire with officers.

Injury: A police officer, pictured above in an ambulance, was treated for minor injury from broken glass from the bullet-riddled windshield

He then drove off again before surrendering. Officers say they found a handgun in his car afterward - as well as the baby, who was taken to a hospital then given back to his family.

Neither her nor the baby were hurt. None of the shots fired hit police - but one officer was taken to hospital after broken glass from the windshield caused minor injuries. 

Gonzales, who was already on parole for a separate offense, has been booked into jail for felonies including attempted murder, child cruelty and assaulting a police officer. He is being held without bail.
