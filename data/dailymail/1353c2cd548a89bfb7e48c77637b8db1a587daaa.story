A French sailor has been rescued from wild seas in a dramatic operation in the Southern Ocean - 500 nautical miles off the coast of Tasmania in Australia.

Alain Delord, 63, was taking part in a solo round-the-world voyage when the mast on his yacht broke in bad weather forcing him to spend three days adrift in treacherous conditions on a life raft. 

He was finally plucked from the sea amid cheers from passengers aboard the luxury cruise ship MV Orion, which had changed course from a trip to Antarctica to save him.

Good spirits: Passengers on board the cruise ship said veteran sailor Alain Delord looked relatively well considering he had spent three days adrift in bad weather conditions

Despite high winds and seven metre waves, Mr Delord looked awake and relatively well as he boarded the Orion, according to passengers.

The Australian Maritime Safety Authority coordinated the rescue and the ship reached Mr Delord at about 9.30pm last night local time.

'He is currently receiving medical attention and early indications are that he is healthy,' the authority said.

'Weather conditions were better than expected and there was plenty of light in the area.'

Orion captain Mike Taylor had warned passengers the stabilisers would have to be switched off as they approached Mr Delord’s raft and urged passengers worried about the ship rolling and rocking to lie down in bed.

The lucky sailor toasted his rescuers with a glass of fine red wine once on board and thanked them for saving his life.

Ian Vella, catering manager aboard the luxury cruise ship Orion, said despite his ordeal Mr Delord was in good spirits and 'absolutely fine' following medical checks.

He said: 'He is very tired and being attended to by the ship’s doctor.

'He is very hungry so he is going to have something to eat and a glass of red wine for his dinner.  

'I think you would all agree what a fantastic effort everyone involved made.

'It went ahead like clockwork, a wonderful job. Alain is aboard and we are under way. All’s well that ends well.'

It is believed the French sailor may have been taking part in the Vendee Globe race but was not a registered competitor.

The race was founded by French sailor Philippe Jeantot in 1989 and is held every four years.

Competitors race from France around the world and in the seas around the Antarctic.

In 1997 Frenchman Thierry Dubois and Briton Tony Bullimore were both rescued in the Southern Ocean during the race.
