The world's largest aircraft is now flying the longest route with the launch of non-stop Qantas flights between Sydney, Australia and Dallas in the Airbus A380.

The airline this week announced that the expansive planes have taken over the nearly 16-hour route from the Boeing 747, operating six return services per week.

The aircraft switch means that first class is now available for the first time on the route,  popular with business travellers.

Long haul: Qantas has announced that their A380 aircraft will take over the non-stop route from Sydney, Australia to Dallas/Fort Worth

Qantas Group CEO Alan Joyce says of the move: 'Today, Qantas is leading the way again with the introduction of the world’s largest passenger aircraft on the world’s longest route, Sydney to Dallas/Fort Worth, with a flying time of almost 16 hours.

'We know our customers will value the comfort of the A380 on this route. It’s also a vote of confidence in Qantas’s business going forward.

'Not only will the A380 increase seats on the route by more than 10 per cent each week, it will also provide us with greater fuel efficiency and the range to operate the return service direct back to Sydney.

Corporate route: The new aircraft means first class will be offered for the first time on the route, popular with business travellers

'Our customers also now have the choice of four cabins to both Los Angeles and Dallas/Fort Worth as we introduce our Marc Newson designed First Class Suites on the Dallas/Fort Worth route for the first time.'

Mr Joyce explains that the 13,804km Sydney-Dallas route is particularly popular with corporate customers flying to the US for its great connections.

'Since starting on the route in 2011 the feedback from our corporate customers, especially those in the resources, technology and agricultural sectors, tells us they like flying into the Dallas hub because it gets them closer to their final destination in the US and offers great onward connections.

Take off: The flight will take 14 hours 50 mins from Sydney to Dallas, and 15 hours 30 mins on the return leg

'The Dallas/Fort Worth service offers direct access right into the heart of the US with over 50 connections to all US major cities all within four hours, including Orlando, Boston and Houston.'

The non-stop service will operate every day except Tuesday. QF7 departs Sydney Kingsford Smith at 13.10, arriving at Dallas/Fort Worth airport at 13.45 local time the same day after a 14 hours 50 minutes flight.

The return service, QF8, will depart DFW at 22.15 and arrive back in Sydney at 06.05 two days later after a flying time of 15 hours 30 minutes. 

Upgrade: Dallas/Fort Worth International airport is building three new jet bridges to accommodate the arrival of the double decker aircraft

'Dallas/Fort Worth is home to our partner American Airlines, and it’s the perfect hub for both business and leisure travellers heading in either direction across the Pacific,' Mr Joyce said.

DFW International Airport is preparing for the arrival of the double-decker aircraft by building three new jet bridges for passengers to embark and disembark the plane.

Qantas has also announced an increase in flights to the US, with 41 services per week.

The second longest flight routes by distance after Sydney to Dallas is the Johannesburg to Atlanta at 13,582km route operated by Delta Airlines, followed by Emirates' Dubai to Los Angeles route at 13,420km.
