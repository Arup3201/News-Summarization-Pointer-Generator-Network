Casey Anthony showed no signs of grief parading in a 'hot body' contest at a Florida nightclub four days after her two-year-old daughter went missing, the court heard during her sensational murder trial.

In the shocking climax to the high-profile trial, the jury today accepted the claims of Anthony's defence team that Caylee drowned in the Anthony family swimming pool on June 16

But witnesses, including Anthony's flatmates and boyfriend, revealed to the court how the single mother from Orlando carried on as normal in June 2008, showing no signs of distress, anxiety or depression and never mentioning her daughter's disappearance.

Anthony's boyfriend, Tony Lazzaro, testified that just hours after her lawyers claim that Caylee drowned, they both went to their local Blockbuster video store to rent a film.

'She was the way she was every day – happy. Happy to see me. Having a grand old time,' said Mr Lazzaro who had begun dating Anthony on June 2 after becoming friends with her on Facebook.

During the month that passed between Caylee last being seen alive and her grandparents calling the police, Anthony enjoyed wild parties joining friends on nights out to local bars and clubs.

On June 20, four days after Caylee drowned, Anthony went to Fusion, a restaurant and nightclub in Orlando, dressed up in a clinging blue-knit dress.

'She was in a Hot Body contest…She was partying and having a good time, drinking, dancing,' said Roy 'Clint' House, who shared an apartment with Anthony's then boyfriend, where she spent much of that month.

A prosecutor asked whether Anthony had seemed worried, depressed, withdrawn, sad, angry, scared or had voiced concern about her daughter. 'No sir,' he replied.

'She seemed like a fun party girl,' said Mr House.

Fellow flatmate Nathan Lezniewicz, 23, told the court: 'She always seemed like she was having a good time. She's not an introvert personality by any means.'

Later that month, Anthony visiting a tattoo parlour to get Italian phrase 'Bella Vita' tattooed on her back, which means the 'good life'.

Friends and flatmates of her boyfriend Tony Lazzaro all concurred, saying that Anthony's demeanour never changed between when they saw her with her little girl in early June, and the period during which they later learned that Caylee had been missing.

'She seemed just the same. Nothing had changed, you know. She was happy,' Cameron Campana, 23, told the court.

When the police were finally called on July 15, Anthony broke down and claimed that Caylee had been kidnapped by her nanny, who later turned out to be fictitious.

Caylee was last seen on June 16, 2008, when Anthony left the family home with her daughter.

But it was not until a month later that police were notified that she was missing.

The single mother told her parents a complex series of lies for why they could not see Caylee, including that the girl was with a nanny named Zanny, that she and her daughter were spending time in Jacksonville with a rich boyfriend and that Zanny had been hospitalised after an out-of-town accident and they were spending time with her.

Finally on July 15, after hearing her daughter's car had been towed, Cindy Anthony confronted her daughter and called 911 to report Caylee was missing.

In a distressed call she told the operator that her granddaughter had been missing for a month and that she had found her daughter's car that day and 'it smells like there's been a dead body in the damn car'.

When Anthony got on the phone, she claimed that her nanny Zenairda Fernandez-Gonzalez - who was later shown not to exist - had taken Caylee.

She claimed she had not reported her missing sooner because she was trying to find her herself, which she admitted was 'stupid'.

The kidnap claim triggered a nationwide search for the toddler and on October 14, 2008, Anthony was indicted for murder.

Then on December 11, 2008, the search for Caylee ended when her skeletal remains were found in woodland with duct tape hanging from her skull.

But the most shocking revelation came on the first day of her murder trial on May 5, when in the defence's opening statement lawyer Jose Baez dropped a bombshell - claiming that Caylee was never missing, but had accidentally drowned in the Anthony's pool on June 16.

He also accused George Anthony of sexually abusing his daughter as a child, having a role in disposing of the body and bullying his daughter into keeping it all secret. Mr Anthony denied the claims.

Mr Baez claimed the family's disfunctional relationship explained Anthony's behaviour after Caylee's death, which he acknowledged was 'bizarre' and 'inappropriate'.
