A knife-wielding man who threatened the driver of a packed school bus has been charged with assault, after the two vehicles were involved in a collision in Sydney's south east.

NSW Police Media confirm that they seized a knife and an 'ice' pipe from the 22-year-old’s car when they came to investigate the incident.

About 57 primary school students and three teachers were on board the bus when it collided with a car on Anzac Parade in Kingsford on Friday afternoon.

An 'ice' pipe was found in the car of a man, who has been charged with common assault and 'destroying or damaging' property, after an altercation with a bus in Kingsford on Friday afternoon.

It's alleged the 22-year-old driver of a black Volvo sedan car got out and tried to force open the bus door, causing damage.

The 60-year-old bus driver struggled to restrain the man, before he returned to his car and armed himself with a utility knife, police said.

The bus driver re-boarded the bus, locked the door and drove away before calling police. 

The Kingsford man was charged with common assault, and destroy or damage property.

57 primary school students were on the bus at the time of the confrontation. The driver of a Volvo sedan tried to force open the bus doors after the two vehicles collided on Anzac Parade.

The incident comes after CCTV footage was released on Wednesday showing a Sydney bus driver crashing his bus into house, after taking what is believe to be synthetic cannabis whilst behind the wheel. 

The 22-year-old involved in the crash on Friday was granted conditional bail and is due to face Waverley Local Court on September 17.

The investigation is ongoing and police ask anyone who witnessed the incident to contact Crime Stoppers on 1800 333 000.
