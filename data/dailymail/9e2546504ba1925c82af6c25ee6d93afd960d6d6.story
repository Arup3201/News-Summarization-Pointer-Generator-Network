A rapper has been charged with ‘child destruction’ after he is alleged to have punched his pregnant teenage girlfriend in the stomach and she lost her baby.

The 16-year-old, who was seven months pregnant, is understood to have screamed out in agony before collapsing in a park.

Bystanders called 999 and she was taken to hospital where  she later miscarried.

Dusan Bako, 18, thought to be the girl’s boyfriend, was arrested and questioned by police before he was charged with child destruction.

He is due to appear before magistrates in Oldham, Greater Manchester, this morning to answer the charge, which carries a maximum sentence of life imprisonment.

Last night it emerged Bako is an aspiring rapper and musician who travelled from eastern Europe two years ago and settled in Oldham.

He features in a number of  videos posted on YouTube, rapping with friends.  

Police were called to  Copster Hill Park, Oldham (pictured) and the girl - who was seven months pregnant - was taken to hospital,  where she sadly lost her unborn baby. Police said she had been punched in the stomach

Neighbours living close to his home said the unemployed teenager was originally from Slovakia or the Czech Republic, spoke poor English and had a small clique of immigrant friends. He regularly features in amateur recordings and videos. 

One neighbour said: ‘He has not been living here very long but he has a close circle of friends and we’ve seen him with a girl. He’s into rap music and struts around in all the rap gear.

‘He’s a fairly friendly lad, though. He’s from eastern Europe and may be part of the Roma community but no one really knows.’

Another said: ‘He has a number of close friends and they’re all into rap music – they hope to break into the music business and they record videos and music together – they have even recorded a music video in the park where this happened.

‘Most of the teenagers are unemployed and with nothing better to do they wander round the streets and the park. I think he had a  girlfriend but we hadn’t seen  her recently.’

The alleged incident happened at 3.15pm on Thursday last week when police were called to reports of an assault at Copster Hill Park in Oldham.

The
 sprawling community area has football pitches, a large children’s play 
area with wooden climbing equipment and swings and a bowling green.

Police said officers found a 16-year-old girl who had been punched in the stomach.

Detective
 Chief Inspector Jamie Daniels said: ‘The circumstances surrounding this
 are exceptionally tragic. We have specially trained officers supporting
 the girl, who is distraught by what happened in a way I cannot begin to
 imagine.

‘The
 incident happened in a public park in broad daylight and we know from 
what people have already said to us that others may have been present in
 or around the park who have seen this take place or have information 
that can help us with this investigation.’

Dusan Bako, 18, from Oldham, Manchester, is to appear at Oldham Magistrates' Court (pictured) on Monday. He is charged with child destruction after a girl, 16, lost her unborn baby after being punched in the stomach

Police said they were 
treating the tragedy as a domestic incident but would not confirm 
whether Bako was in a relationship with the teenager or was the father 
of the unborn baby.

The offence of child destruction came into the statute books with the Infant Life (Preservation) Act of 1929.

It states that anyone who intentionally destroys the life of a child capable of being born alive could be found guilty.

The law stipulates that the foetus would have to be 28 weeks or older for the charge to be made.

In
 South Wales in 2012, Carl Whant was convicted of child destruction 
after he fatally stabbed Nikitta Grender, who was eight-and-a-half 
months pregnant, in the abdomen in February 2011.

Whant was also 
convicted of raping Miss Grender before murdering her and was given a 
life sentence with a minimum jail term of 35 years.

A spokesman for 
the Crown Prosecution Service in Wales said at the time: ‘Child 
destruction is a very rarely used charge; we are not aware of another 
case like this one in Wales.’
