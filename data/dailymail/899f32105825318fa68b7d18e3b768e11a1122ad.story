Even in the nude, a boat owner still tried to defend his boat when a trio of men allegedly robbed him of his alcohol and prawns.

A 59-year-old man was sleeping on his charter cruise vessel - Cape Adieu - at Stokes Hill Wharf in Darwin on Friday when he was woken up by a father and his two sons rifling through his belongings at 5.45am.

Northern Territory Duty Superintendent Louise Jorgensen commended the man for fighting back.

The alleged thieves boarded Cape Adieu while the boat's owner was naked and sleeping on board

'Often as you do in the territory, the man was sleeping naked and confronted the offenders in the nude,' she told Daily Mail Australia.

'Despite his nakedness, the man fought back with his hands.

'The offenders were a little confronted by the naked male.

'You have to admire the [alleged] victim for doing what he did.'

The incident happened early Friday morning at Stokes Hill Wharf in Darwin where the trio took alcohol and prawns

Unfortunately, the offenders made their escape after they struck the boat owner in the face with glass bottles.

As a result, he suffered lacerations and bruises to his face.

But thanks to the public, police were able to catch up with the family of alleged thieves later on the same day after they drove off in a maroon Ford Falcon.

'They came to our attention because they were driving erratically,' Duty Supt Jorgensen said.

'People rang in and we were able to apprehend them at the service station.'

Northern Territory police's Serious Crimes Squad detectives arrested the three men - aged 49, 15 and 17 - at a Pinelands petrol station and charged them with aggravated robbery and aggravated unlawful entry.

The 49-year-old father was further charged with driving and drug offences after a small cannabis plant was located in the car.

The trio were remanded in custody and faced court on Tuesday.
