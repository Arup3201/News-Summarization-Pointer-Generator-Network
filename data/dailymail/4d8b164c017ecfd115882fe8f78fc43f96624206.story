Jailed: Osaro Osaigbovo laundered almost £200,000 for a gang which tricked people on dating sites

An aide to a gang of confidence tricksters who conned victims from around the world on dating websites has been jailed for three years.

Businessman Osaro Osaigbovo, 39, laundered almost £200,000 for the gang, whose members posed as lovestruck singletons on websites including Match.com and Adult Friend Finder.

One 59-year-old Belgian victim was swindled out of more than £320,000 in the belief he was helping a young artist called Chloe Elsevier living in County Durham, the court heard.

He continued sending funds despite being warned by police it could be a trick - and even sent the gang a copy of the police's letter.

The man only realised he had been conned when he read an article in The Northern Echo about the newspaper’s investigation into the gang.

In another case, a woman from Florida was duped out of nearly £25,000 by a man claiming he was a neurosurgeon in Los Angeles who needed to sort out the affairs of his dead business partner.

Members of Osaigbovo’s family fell to the floor in shock and screamed as he was led away to the cells.  

Southwark Crown Court heard Osaigbovo, of Dartford, Kent, was not one of the confidence tricksters but his financial help made him a key part of the operation.

The businessman came to Britain with 'big dreams' and gained a master’s degree in human resources from the University of Hertfordshire, before becoming a ‘substantial contributor’ to the God Worshippers Ministry in Hackney, east London.

The court heard he laundered almost £194,000 and received £45,641.78 from the scam, which was carried out between 2010 and 2011. 

He denied the offences but was found guilty of entering into a money laundering arrangement and three counts of acquiring criminal property.

The jury did, however, find him not guilty of a second count of money laundering and seven counts of acquiring criminal property.

His sister-in-law, Telma Asemota, 30, was acquitted of entering into a money laundering arrangement and five counts of acquiring criminal property. 

Danny Robinson, prosecuting, said 'the effect that the frauds had upon their victims’ was clear.

‘These were particularly mean offences committed upon those looking for love and relationships over the internet,' he said.

Opportunity: One of the sites used by the gang was Match.com, the court heard. Recorder Christopher Morris-Coole said such cons are 'gathering momentum through the use of internet dating agencies' worldwide

Social network: Another website used by the gang was Adult Friend Finder, pictured. One man lost £320,000

‘Mr Osaigbovo was in this together with others - that’s how this case was put to the jury.’ 

David Smith, defending, said Osaigbovo lives with five family members, including two sisters-in-law, and came to the UK with ‘big dreams’.

He had recently been offered a role as a human resources assistant after leaving a cleaning job.

The judge, Mr Recorder Christopher Morris-Coole, told Osaigbovo: ‘This was an iniquitous trick that seems to be gathering momentum through the use of internet dating agencies throughout the world.

‘In this case there was clear evidence that persons had joined up with internet dating organisations and through that they had entered into regular communications with certain persons.

‘These persons were frauds and pretended to be totally different people to who they were.

Osaigbovo’s family members fell to the floor and screamed as he was jailed at Southwark Crown Court

‘The actual stories given to the subscribers were subtle and developed over time in order to gain their confidence.

‘The victims were vulnerable people seeking friendship and long-term security, putting their trust and faith in these tricksters who appeared genuine to them.

‘Your role was not the original confidence trickster, but it is clear from the evidence that you became engaged in the money laundering process at a very early stage.

‘I am approaching sentencing on the basis that you were the money launderer, and therefore you were not the ultimate beneficiary.

‘I am not prepared to accept what was said that you were simply performing these acts as favours.

‘Your behaviour in this case was so serious that only a custodial sentence is appropriate.’
