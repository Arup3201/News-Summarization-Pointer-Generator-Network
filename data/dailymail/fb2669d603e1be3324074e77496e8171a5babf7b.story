Fuel prices rose again yesterday as the first petrol delivery trucks rolled out of the Coryton oil refinery since its parent company went bust.

Diesel edged ever closer to a new record high that retailers predict will be hit by the end of the month amid concerns that crude oil deliveries to the refinery are being held in limbo.

On average across the UK, diesel increased to 142.41p a litre, to within a fraction of a penny of a new record, from 142.32p, the AA reported.

Petrol rose to 134.13p a litre, up from 134.03p on Wednesday.

Record fuel prices were set in May last year when diesel hit 143.04p and petrol 137.43p.

Petrol retailers predict diesel 
prices in particular are set to soar by up to 3p to a new record £1.45 a
litre. That would see a £100 fill-up for ‘Mondeo Man’ in his - or her -
family saloon with a 70-litre tank.

Brian Madderson, chairman of the 
forecourt retailers’ group RMI Petrol, welcomed the resumption of 
supplies from Coryton, but warned: ‘Although it is hoped that supplies 
will not be affected in the short term, we are already seeing an adverse
impact on wholesale fuel prices.

‘There is pressure on wholesale 
prices due to the developing EU embargo on Iranian crude oil shipments 
which was confirmed at a meeting of EU officials only last Monday. The 
Coryton setback now just adds further pressure to an already difficult 
market.’

He added: ‘Wholesale prices for 
diesel have risen by 0.8ppl and petrol by 1.2ppl since last weekend and 
with 20 per cent VAT added, average UK prices at the pump are also rising. We 
are could see diesel over the 143.04p per litre record high of May 2011 
by the end of January.'

Mr Madderson suggested Coryton and other refineries may still be vulnerable.

He said: ‘It is good news that road 
tankers on the move again from the refinery. However, this may only 
provide a short term solution. The Coryton refinery currently holds a 
limited amount of crude oil on site and urgently needs new stocks.’

He added: ‘This is wake up call for 
the UK’s energy resilience and we will be looking to Government to take 
the lead. How financially secure is the former Shell refinery at Stanlow
in Cheshire? The new owner, Essar, has seen its share price collapse on
the London stock market from 550p to 127p.’

He said the Coryton refinery currently holds a limited amount of crude oil on site and urgently needs new stocks.

A Chinese tanker was due to discharge at Coryton No 4 berth on Saturday but has been held at anchorage in the Thames Estuary.

Mr Madderson said: ’It is believed 
that this stalemate will continue until the cargo owners find a 
financial guarantor for this very costly shipment.’

A second tanker due to discharge at Coryton No. 5 berth next Tuesday is also at anchor awaiting financial guarantors, he said.

Queues of motorists yesterday 
continued to line up at the pumps, raising fears of fuel panic-buying - 
despite the fact that petrol delivery trucks were rolling from the 
gates of Coryton oil refinery.

However,
it may be too late to stop fuel price rises sparked by the shut-down 
and already in the pipeline from hitting forecourts.

Coryton refinery in Essex , one of the main oil refineries to London and the South East has been closed by its Swiss owner, raising the prospect of fuel shortages on the capital's forecourts

Petrol
retailers and motoring groups believe prices will be driven up by 
speculators taking advantage of the three days of disruption on the 
wholesale fuel markets.

There was queuing at some forecourts as the shutdown led to fears of fuel shortages and price hikes.

The Essex refinery's administrators 
PriceWaterhouseCooper blamed the three-day hold up of deliveries on a 
legal and contractual wrangle over supplies.

Payment for Corytons fuel have 
traditionally been made through the refinery’s Swiss parent company 
Petroplus which went bust on Tuesday. Receivers say they have spent the 
time since then trying to ‘unscramble the system’ and put new contracts 
in place with customers, including hundreds of BP and Texaco forecourts.

Yesterday
the receivers said that after discussions with suppliers and customers 
they had started shipments of refined oil products with immediate 
effect, easing fears over fuel shortages.

The
site, which supplies 20 per cent of fuel in London and the South East, 
halted sales after its Swiss owner Petroplus placed the refinery into 
administration, prompting fears of up to 1,000 job losses.

BP is understood to be the refinery's biggest customer but previously said it had not suffered from any immediate supply issues.

The formerly BP-owned refinery had been 
operating as usual otherwise, but with no deliveries of petrol or other 
products, including bitumen, leaving the site.

While deliveries have started again, PwC was unable to confirm whether the shipments were running at full capacity.

Coryton staff have been told to expect some job losses although administrators say they are confident of finding a buyer.

A ship was due to dock yesterday to unload 600,000 barrels of crude oil, said union officials.

PwC,
which is also dealing with the administration of two other locations - 
an oil storage site in Teesside and a research and development site in 
Swansea - said Petroplus had suffered as a result of 'low refining 
margins and high restructuring costs’.
