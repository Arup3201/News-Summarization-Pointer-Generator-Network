Willy Caballero has promised he will fight to keep Joe Hart out of the Manchester City team after starting ahead of the England goalkeeper in the FA Community Shield.

It was not a debut to remember for Caballero as City lost 3-0 to Arsenal at Wembley, but the 32-year-old Argentine is determined to get another chance when the champions launch their title defence at Newcastle, on Sunday.

'I want to be number one,' said Caballero. 'I will train for this weekend for the next decision to see who starts next week. Both of us will train for that chance. But I came to fight for the number one spot. I will train for the next opportunity.

'My ambition is to fight for the position and to be there when the manager needs me. I feel good. This was an important match for me. I had a chance to play and am happy for this, but not happy with the score. We missed out on another title.'

Caballero was a £6million summer signing from Malaga where he worked with Manuel Pellegrini and his arrival has an ominous ring for Hart, who lost his place for two months last season, when the City boss turned to Costel Pantilimon, who has since joined Sunderland.

He has clearly not moved to Manchester with the intention of sitting on the bench.

'We have a strong team,' said Caballero. 'We are the Premier League champions, with very good players, but we have things we need to prove.

'Manuel has told all of us that we need to learn game by game, and that we have to start well in the league. I think we can win the title again. We have to do what we did last year, to win the league. 

'We were the best team in the Premier League. We have to improve in the Champions League and we have a good squad to do that.'
