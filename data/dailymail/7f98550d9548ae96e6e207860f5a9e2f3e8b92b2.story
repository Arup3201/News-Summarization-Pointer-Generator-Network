Dane Kowalski, 27, left his Diamond Creek home in Victoria on December 12 for a fishing trip in Darwin

The best friend of a 27-year-old man who has been missing for 20 days, is so desperate to find his mate that he has offered $25,000 in reward money from his own pocket for any information.

There has been no trace of Dane Kowalski, 27, since he left his Diamond Creek home in Victoria on December 12 for a fishing trip in Darwin where he planned to meet up with some local friends.

Brittany Taylor, the partner of Mr Kowalski's best friend Anthony Hudson, told Daily Mail Australia that the missing man's family and friends were beside themselves with worry.

'No one has heard a word. There's been nothing since then [December 12]; his phone hasn't been touched, his bank account hasn't been touched, social media – nothing,' Ms Taylor said.

'He's missed Christmas, his god-daughter's birthday, some really vital things that we knew he was looking forward to. It's so out of character. It's not unusual for him to travel, but it is unusual for him not to check in.

'Everyone's beside themselves: his mum is not coping at all, everyone's a mess, everyone's doing everything they can, everyone's breaking down and trying to support each other.'

The enormous search effort for Mr Kowalski has involved police, psychics, missing posters, a social media campaign, a website and various fundraisers. 

Now, his friends and family are considering hiring a plane in Darwin for a more thorough search.

Four of the much-loved man's friends returned home two days ago after driving from Melbourne to Darwin, handing out missing posters and looking for signs of their missing friend. They flew back to Darwin on New Year's Day to continue their search.

'My partner put that reward money - $25,000 - out of his own pocket. He's desperate to have his best friend back home. If someone knows something or they've seen something - we're desperate,' Ms Taylor said.

Desperate: Mr Kowalski's friends and family have launched a widespread search in which they have retraced his footsteps from Victoria to Darwin and handed out hundreds of missing posters 

'He's missed Christmas, his god-daughter's (pictured) birthday - some really vital things that we knew he was looking forward to. It's so out of character...Everyone's beside themselves: his mum is not coping at all, everyone's a mess,' Brittany Taylor, the partner of Mr Kowalski's best friend Anthony Hudson, said 

One of the many psychics, who responded to the social media campaign, told Mr Kowalski's family that the young man may have stopped to help someone whose car was hit by a kangaroo before a scuffle broke out and his car was taken.

It's just one of the many lead's his desperate family has followed up, including checking road tolls and phone records, but to no avail.

Ms Taylor and the rest of Mr Kowalski's friends and family have issued a plea of help to the public to help them find him.

'Even if people just put one flyer up on the back of their car windscreen – that's incredible and everything is appreciated,' Ms Taylor said.

'We don't think it's likely at all, but if he wants to be left alone we just want him to let us know he's ok. He's so missed and so loved and we're doing everything we can to get him home.

Dane is described as being of Caucasian appearance, approximately 185cm tall, of athletic build with blue eyes and undercut brown hair. He was driving a white 2004 Holden Rodeo ute with the registration WN114. Anyone who sees Dane is urged to contact Triple Zero (000) immediately

'He's one of the most amazing people you'll ever meet; he'd give you everything he had if he knew he could help you. You can't say a bad word about him, you really can't. He really loves life.'
