Do you know your cobalt from your carbon? Can you identify planets from close-up images? Do you you know the difference between Assassins Creed and Thief game characters or name the eleventh doctor in Doctor Who?

To celebrate YouTube's Geek Week the video site has created a quiz designed to help you find out exactly how geeky you are.

The questions are generated at random and use clips from YouTube videos, TV shows, How-to instructional clips and more to create a Geek IQ score.

The Geek IQ test has 25 different clips in total but only ten questions are asked during each quiz and the IQ score to aim for is 300. Each video clip is shown with three multiple-choice answers but no questions, pictured

Who is Hitman?

a) Agent 47

b) Agent 23

c) Agent 99

There are 25 different clips in total but only ten are shown during each quiz.

The IQ score to aim for is 300.

Each video clip is shown with three multiple-choice answers but no questions.

The clip begins and the player has to identify what show or video it is from, guess what the question could be and pick the corresponding answer.

Clips are only shown for five seconds before the page reloads and the next video is played.

Circles underneath the videos track the player's progress.

Questions in the quiz include subjects such as the video game Hitman, developer code, solar system planets, skydiving, gases and minerals and cult TV shows.

YouTubeâ€™s first-ever Geek Week, taking place until Saturday is a 'celebration of all things geek'.

Throughout the week the site has looked at how characters have shaped geek culture in iconic movies and internet franchises, presented a showcase of 'geekery from around the world' including animation from Japan and India, and carried out science experiments.

One of the questions in the Geek IQ quiz tests player's knowledge of the BBC show Doctor Who. The question being asked here is which number doctor was played by Matt Smith, pictured

Does this image of cat next to a vial of deadly gas represent a theory from Schumacher, Reinhold or Schrodinger?

The week concludes on August 10 with highlights available on catch-up from the Geek Week hub.

As part of the celebrations, YouTube also teamed up with British cult children's TV show Knightmare to launch a brand new episode.

It was produced by the original creator, Tim Child, and features the original Lord Fear, played by Mark Knight, Lissard, played by Clifford Barry and Dungeon Master Treguard, played by Hugo Myatt.

The show was recorded in the original Knightmare studio in Norwich and the players were made up of YouTube video stars including DanIsNotOnFire, AmazingPhil, EmmaBlackery and Ashens.

They played alongside Isy Suttie, who was Dobby in Peep Show, and Lavender Brown from Harry Potter played by Jessie Cave.

At the end of the test each player is given an IQ score and the top score to aim for is 300. These scores can be shared on Google+, Facebook and Twitter or players can click the arrow to play again
