Movie maker Ben Pickering (pictured) was the ring leader in a multi-million pound mortgage swindle in South Wales, Swansea Crown Court heard

A film producer who once worked with actor Burt Reynolds has been jailed for his part in a £5million mortgage scam.

Movie maker Ben Pickering was the ring leader in the  swindle which involved 30 properties in South Wales, Swansea Crown Court heard.

The 35-year-old - a former Conservative party candidate who once directed a pilot for a drama called 'How To Get Away With Murder' - invented a string of characters as part of the eight year fraud, the court heard.

Pickering, who has produced a series of crime thrillers, lined his pockets after making fake mortgage applications.

But he ended up in court over the scam after admitting conspiracy to defraud and was today jailed for six years.

Judge Keith Thomas told him: 'These offences were fuelled not by economic necessity, but by greed.'

Pickering had his own production company called Jericho Lane Pictures and worked on a number of motion pictures.

He was on the production team for the £1.2million-budget comedy Party Pieces starring Burt Reynolds and Jane March.

Pickering's career started in 1995 when he was just 16 when he produced and starred in his first feature, a coming-of-age drama called Backstreet.

He then made a low budget gangster film called Tragic Irony, described as a cross-between Pulp Fiction and Shallow Grave.

Pickering directed a pilot for a series called 'How To Get Away With Murder' in 1999 and a short film called Beached which stared Ray Gravell and was shown at Cannes.

He directed a crime thriller Two Days in the Smoke and horror film Welcome to Curiosity.

Pickering had also been a prospective parliamentary candidate for the Conservative Party in Swansea, South Wales in 2000, before moving to Truro in Cornwall.

But between 2003 and 2011 he ran a complex fraud operation with Mark Cainen, 46, Paul John, 44 and Emma Davey, 34.

A court heard how the 35-year-old (pictured left and right) invented a string of characters as part of the eight year fraud

The court heard how the four behind the plot made more than 30 mortgage applications for properties across South Wales  using false names and fictitious employment details to lenders including the Leeds Building Society.

Swansea Crown Court heard how they conspired to make cash out of the housing market by defaulting on the loans they had secured - and then looking to buy back the properties on the cheap.

In some cases, the court was told, they drove down the prices even by making up land ownership disputes to make the homes less desirable. 

Judge Thomas said: 'I have been told in letters on behalf of Pickering the economic downturn and its effect on the housing market was the driving factor.

'I don't accept that argument in any shape or form, these offences were fraudulent from the outset. This was fuelled not by economic necessity but by greed.'

Carl Harrison, prosecuting, said: 'Pickering and Cainen acted as buyers, sellers and points of contact in the conspiracy and they provided false information such as shadow salary payments, invoices, pay slips and P60 documents giving details of tax said to have been paid.

'They were effectively stealing the identities of other people and companies and taking the identities of people of a similar age to get mortgages approved.'

During Cainen's trial at Swansea Crown Court, emails showed Cainen saying to Pickering: 'Get your smoke and mirrors out' and on one occasion Cainen is said to have criticised Pickering 'for not being a good crook'.

At one time Cainen had more than 20 bank accounts in different names and Pickering obtained software to make false pay slips. 

The four fraudsters used false names and fictitious employment and salary details to secure loans off lenders totalling £5million between 2003 and 2011.

They would back up their applications using fabricated pay slips.

But they would soon default on the mortgage repayments and then set about trying to buy back the properties at a cheaper price.

The court was told that sometimes they would even drive down the value of the homes by making up land ownership disputes to make the property seem less desirable - before snapping them up at lower prices using 

Some 20 fake bank accounts were set up as the group serviced the elaborate scam and Pickering even had software to make the fabricated payslips.

It is not yet clear how much the gang made from the enterprise. 

Paul John was sacked by a Swansea finance firm in 2008 when a colleague found a false mortgage application for his wife in his desk drawer. 

Pickering, John and Davey admitted conspiracy to defraud while Cainen was found guilty after a trial at Swansea Crown Court.

Pickering was jailed for six years, Cainen for eight years and John for three years and four months.

The judge suspended Davey's jail term due to previous good character and the fact she was 'prevailed upon' by Cainen to get involved. She was given 200 hours unpaid work.
