A double killer is believed to have murdered again within hours of being freed early – for the second time.

Ian McLoughlin, 55, went to the home of a paedophile he had met in jail and allegedly stabbed a neighbour to death after a row broke out.

Last night, as police hunted the ‘dangerous’ fugitive, relatives of one of his earlier victims demanded to know why a ‘monster’ had been freed allegedly to murder again.

And the widow of the latest man to die said: ‘I’ve lost my rock.’

McLoughlin, who also used the name 
Baker, was freed from jail on day release on Saturday morning and by the
afternoon had apparently stabbed to death a Good Samaritan who caught 
him robbing a neighbour’s home.

On his first day of unsupervised 
release, McLoughlin is said to have targeted the £1million home of Old 
Etonian Francis Cory-Wright, 87,a convicted paedophile he got to know 
while the two were in prison together.

He is believed to have been 
interrupted by a neighbour, named yesterday as grandfather and 
father-of-three Graham Buck, who overheard shouting and went to help.

McLoughlin is suspected of grabbing a 
knife from the kitchen and repeatedly stabbing Mr Buck, 66, a retired 
businessman, before fleeing with thousands of pounds in cash.

The killing has disturbing 
similarities to his first two killings, both of which were followed by 
the theft of the dead man’s belongings. In 1990, McLoughlin forced his 
landlord, Peter Halls, to lie down on the bed then stabbed him through 
the neck and stole luxury goods worth thousands of pounds.

That brutal murder took place only 17 months after he was released from a five-year jail term for another killing.

At the time, Mr Halls’s sister Pamela 
condemned his release from jail in the first place, saying: ‘McLoughlin 
should not have been released after he committed this sort of crime the 
first time.’

Yesterday, when it emerged that he was
granted day release from an open prison as part of his 
‘rehabilitation’, she branded the justice system ‘a joke’.

The 71-year-old mother-of-two from 
Brighton said: ‘This monster has struck again and has been allowed to 
strike again because he has been freed to walk the streets just as he 
was with my poor brother.

‘Justice in this country is just a 
joke. How can this man keep being released to kill again? He was given a
life sentence and that should have meant life. If it did it looks like 
this poor chap in Hertfordshire would still be alive.

‘I pray he is caught soon. Nothing can
change men like McLoughlin, he is evil and should have been left 
rotting in a prison cell where he deserves to be, not free to kill and 
kill again.’

She said she had spent more than 20 years trying to come to terms with her brother’s killing.

She said: ‘I have tried to put Peter’s
killing behind me but you never forget. Now all the terrible emotions I
felt have come back to the surface.

‘McLoughlin has never shown a scrap of remorse for what he did to Peter. I would be happy if they gave him a lethal injection.’

Mr Buck leaves a wife, two sons, a 
daughter and two grandchildren, and a wife from a previous marriage. His
wife, Karen, a 55-year-old nurse, said: ‘I’ve lost my rock. I wouldn’t 
be able to do half the things I’ve done since being with Graham if it 
wasn’t for him. He and his family have always been there for me in 
difficult times. I don’t know what I’ll do without him.’

In a statement, his family added: ‘We 
have no words to express how much Graham will be missed. We were all in 
such a happy place as a family. We were all so settled, with growing 
numbers of grandchildren whom he adored being around.

‘We haven’t seen him happier than being around his grandchildren, he was so proud. We cannot get over that we have lost him.’

McLoughlin first killed in 1983 aged 25. After crashing his car while drunk he admitted to police he had done a ‘bad thing’.

They went to the home of Len Delgatty,
49, from Stoke Newington, North London, and found his body upside down 
in a cupboard, with the skull smashed in seven times with a hammer. The 
house had been ransacked for cash.

McLoughlin was charged with murder but
was found guilty of manslaughter, after he claimed he had attacked 
Delgatty – who had served time for having sex with teenage boys – only 
after he told him of a fantasy for under-age sex.

He was released after 
only five years after behaving as a ‘model prisoner’, but within 17 
months he had killed again.

He was sentenced to 25 years for 
murdering Mr Halls, his Brighton landlord, and was not eligible for 
parole for another three years.

The house of the dead man, who was in his sixties, was cordoned off by police officers after the attack

But early on Saturday, McLoughlin, who 
also used the name Baker, was let out of Spring Hill open prison in 
Grendon Underwood, Buckinghamshire, for 12 hours unsupervised. He was 
due back at 7pm.

He made his way to the quiet village 
of Little Gaddesden in Hertfordshire, less than 30 miles away, to the 
£1million home of Corey-Wright, a former Lloyd’s underwriter whose 
grandfather, Sir Arthur Cory-Wright, was High Sheriff of Hertfordshire.

The Oxford graduate returned home last year from a 30-month sentence for indecently assaulting a ten-year-old boy 35 years ago.

Mr Buck, who lived two doors down, had
been watching the Ashes cricket at home. At around 3.30pm, he overheard
shouting and went to help.

Detective Chief Superintendent Jeff 
Hill said McLoughlin went to the property for a ‘purely financial 
motive’. He warned the public that McLoughlin is ‘extremely dangerous’ 
and should not be approached. Paying tribute to Mr Buck, he said he had 
‘paid the ultimate price for intervening at the home of an elderly 
neighbour’.

Cory-Wright, who suffered injuries during the attack, was discharged from hospital yesterday.

Ian John McLoughlin, also known as Ian John Baker, has been described as ‘astonishingly bright’, with an IQ of 140.

Born in Lancashire in 1958, he spent much of his youth in care homes and picked up a string of convictions for petty theft and burglary.

By his early 20s he was a drifter, reportedly earning money as a rent boy and sleeping rough when his cash ran out.

He briefly married at 25, but his marriage collapsed under the strain of his heavy drinking and his continued involvement in crime and prostitution.

In October 1983 he was stopped by police after crashing a stolen car in London while drunk.

Kept in a cell to sober up, he demanded to see the custody sergeant and told him: ‘I’ve done a bad thing.’

McLoughlin had killed a gay man, Len Delgatty, smashing his skull seven times with a hammer before strangling him with a towel.

At his trial, McLoughlin told the jury that Delgatty, 49, – who had previous convictions for sexually abusing teenage boys – had played him an audio tape describing a graphic sexual fantasy of having under-age sex with a teenage boy.

McLoughlin claimed he had ‘panicked’ and repeatedly struck out at Delgatty. He said he had thrown the tape away.

The jury convicted him of manslaughter, not murder, and he was sentenced to 13 years, reduced to eight on appeal – he was released in 1989 after serving only five years.

Seventeen months later he stabbed gay barman Peter Halls, 55, through the neck at his home in Brighton.

In July 1992, he was convicted of murder and given a life sentence, with a minimum tariff of 25 years.

McLoughlin’s 25-year minimum term would have meant he was eligible for release on licence in 2017 but he was moved to a Category D ‘open resettlement prison’ so he could prepare for life outside.
