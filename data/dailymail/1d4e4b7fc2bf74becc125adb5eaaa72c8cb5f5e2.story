The FA are fully behind UEFA’s intention to put up a candidate to fight Sepp Blatter for the FIFA presidency in next year’s election.

English football’s ruling body believe anything is better than Blatter, 78, being handed a fifth term in office and will support whoever UEFA decide should stand.

The FA stance is similar to their position during the last FIFA election in 2011, when former FA chairman David Bernstein stood alone in making a congress speech opposing Blatter standing alone for the presidency.

Out! The FA are behind UEFA¿s intention to put up a candidate to fight Sepp Blatter

Blatter, who is likely to announce he wants to carry on at the FIFA congress in Sao Paulo after receiving stage-managed endorsements from a number of confederation leaders, is almost certain to win with many votes already in the bag.

But if, as expected, UEFA chief Michel Platini doesn’t stand, several credible Europeans are said to be prepared to take on Blatter.

The FA, England and St George’s Park management all give a stock answer to the lack of use by the national team of their £100million training centre outside Burton.

They are there for two days in the World Cup build-up. The glib excuse is that SGP was not meant just for the senior side but constructors Bowmer & Kirkland, who built the state-of-the-art facility, are among those perplexed at its lack of use by the squad.

League Two play-off losers Burton, on the other hand, are at SGP four times a week.

Certain blazers on the FA international committee have accompanied England for entire tournaments. But this summer chairman Ivan Gazidis, aware of his Arsenal commitments, will be in Brazil for only a short period, as will Tottenham’s Darren Eales. Committee men Robert Coar, David Barnard, Peter Barnes, Keith Lamb and Barry Taylor will rotate duties between Miami and Rio.   .......................................................................

Relationships between the FA and the Premier League are always strained and the sexist emails saga will only add to that.

David Gill, a Premier League representative on the FA, made it clear at a special meeting before the FA council last week how annoyed he was about FA independent director Heather Rabbatts saying in public that PL chief executive Richard Scudamore should ‘consider his position’.

Rabbatts could hardly remain silent when she chairs the FA inclusion board, whose members had been the most vocal on the affair. Rabbatts has now been mandated by chairman Greg Dyke to lead for the FA on inclusion discussions with Scudamore. 

The PL are still considering whether to complain to the police over temporary secretary Rani Abraham selling the email exchanges involving Scudamore and lawyer Nick West to the Sunday Mirror.

They have the backing of clubs to do so. It is thought Abraham viewed as many as 900 emails in Scudamore’s personal premierleague.com account.    ......................................................................

Jose’s a no-show...

Jose Mourinho and his excitable Chelsea assistant Rui Faria were due to attend the Championship play-off and had seats reserved at the pre-match lunch in the VIP Wembley Suite.

It is understood they would watch Derby striker Patrick Bamford, a loan signing from Chelsea.

But neither showed up and Bamford played only a minute of Derby’s defeat by QPR after coming on as a substitute in added time.

Derby’s defeat stopped the character that is W Brett Wilson enlivening PL chairmen’s meetings next season.

Despite his dislike for dressing up, the  Canadian entrepreneur, who owns a quarter of Derby, wore a tie to conform to the Wembley Suite dress code but teamed it with leather jacket, jeans and trainers. Nobody from the Wembley style police dared to object.

Chelsea are spending around £4m on improving their sports science set-up at their Cobham training base, digging underground to construct the basement facilities to conform with planning restrictions.

The club are also laying two Desso pitches identical to the new Stamford Bridge surface.
