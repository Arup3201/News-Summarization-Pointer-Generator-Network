The tiniest apple on the high street will go on sale on Monday having been discovered by chance.

The apple being marketed as Tiddly Pomme has been snapped up exclusively by Marks & Spencer.

The retailer hopes the super-sweet apple, a miniature version of the Royal Gala variety, will especially appeal to children.

At 42mm in diameter the apples are the same size as a golf ball.

A pack of six will cost Â£1.49 and two of the apples count as one of your five a day.

Grand entrance: M&S announced their new product's name to Facebook fans who had sent in ideas as diverse as Mini-apple-is and Red Dwarf

M&S buyer Shazad Rehman said: 'The Tiddly Pomme is perfect for kids. Our customers like to try new fruit and we're sure it will be a real hit. Don't be fooled by its appearance, what it lacks in size, it more than makes up for in flavour.'

Made for tiny tastebuds: M&S hopes the Tiddly Pomme will get kids eating their five-a-day

Consultant David Cranwell happened upon the 42mm-diameter fruits on a routine walk around his orchards in New Zealand.

If
the tiny fruits sell well, M&S, which buys the fruit from Empire 
World Trade Fruit, will plant its own Tiddly Pommes in Britain.

The name Tiddly Pomme - a nod to the classic 
Winnie the Pooh rhyme 'Tiddly Pom' by AA Milne - was chosen from more than 6,500 suggestions put 
forward by fans on Facebook.

M&S admitted they had been struggling to find a good name for the product.

From the bumper crop of suggestions from Facebook fans the team picked five, which went to a poll. Tiddly Pomme was the clear winner ahead of Petite Pomme, Little Munch, Red Dwarf and Apple-Teeny.

Other ideas not in the shortlist included Pip Squeak (off-limits because it has already been trademarked), Mini-apple-is and Pink Ladette.
