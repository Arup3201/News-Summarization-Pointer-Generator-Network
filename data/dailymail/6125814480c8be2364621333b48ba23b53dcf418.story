Warning signs: Miriam Carey's Connecticut home was visited by police several times leading up to her Capitol Hill rampage October 3 and police now say she behaved erratically and made bizarre claims about Barrack Obama

A delusional but extremely lucid-seeming call to 911 from a Connecticut mother in the months leading up to her October 3 attempt to ram the White House with her car have been released by Stamford police.

Miriam Carey, the self-described Prophet of Stamford who died after a Capitol Hill car chase ended in a barrage of bullets, made the alarming call to authorities to report people watching her outside her apartment.

Police responded and found no evidence of people watching the 34-year-old. And on two other occasions, after Carey’s boyfriend Eric Francis, 55, made calls to report Carey’s mental instability, police arrived to find the new mother convinced that Obama was spying on her.

In a 911 call from November 29, 2012 
obtained by the New York Post, Carey insists she’s been monitored by her
new neighbors for months.

‘I have some people prowling outside of my window and they’ve been prowling outside of my window for, uh, all day,’ she said.

Carey,
who comes off throughout the call as totally coherent and lucid, had 
been diagnosed with post-partum psychosis and had her daughter in a car 
seat next to her during the rampage.

Carey said there were four or five ‘people loitering, and they’re actually trying to videotape me from my window.’

She
told the operator that she knew them, all of them were men, and that 
they’d been monitoring her since moving into her apartment complex 
months before.

Asked why they might be interested in taping her, Carey said the men had ‘special interests and items,’ but did not elaborate.

Surrounded: Police officers surrounded the car with their weapons drawn after Carey rammed a barricade close to the White House October 3

Searching for answers: Carey's sisters have been vocal about their belief that Carey was not delusional. But her boyfriend Eric Francis couldn't disagree more

After investigating, police reports indicate there was no evidence that anyone was watching outside the dental hygienist’s windows.

Police records also show that Eric Francis had expressed concern about her emotional stability and the safety of their infant daughter.

In a December 10, 2012 call, Francis told the operator that Carey was outside her apartment in the cold, holding the baby while neither of them had on coats.

‘She just went outside and I can’t get her back in and the baby does not have no coat or anything,’ he said.

Questions: Sisters Valerie (left) and Amy 
(right) are now in a custody battle over 14-month-old baby Erica, who survived the crash. Francis has his daughter now and claims Carey was extremely delusional prior to her calamitous death. The sisters disagree and are fighting to get Erica

He said she’d previously locked herself in the bathroom and wouldn’t come out. ‘This has been going on for a week, now,’ he said. ‘She need help. Please.’

When police arrived, Carey resisted the authorities’ attempts to help her and told them that President Obama had her under surveillance.

She also insisted the president ‘put Stamford in a lockdown after speaking to her because she is the prophet of Stamford.’

The records released Thursday by Stamford police also say that Francis called them twice later in December to report she was having delusions and becoming violent.

Another call to police this past May made by Carey to report that the wheels had been stolen from her 2011 Infiniti, the same car she used in her unsuccessful attack on the white house, and the car placed on cement blocks.

Responding offers found that the theft had, indeed, occurred.

Carey’s 14-month-old daughter Erica is currently in the custody of her father after a failed attempt by Carey’s sister to gain emergency custody October 11.
