A shortage of pupils could force the closure of a school that has helped disabled children with learning difficulties for 101 years.

The crisis comes despite official figures showing soaring numbers of children are being classed as having special educational needs.

St Rose’s was one of only three schools of its type when it was founded by Roman Catholic nuns in 1912 in Stroud, Gloucestershire.

But pupil numbers have plummeted to just 35 at a time when a fifth of all pupils in state schools are considered to have problems including learning difficulties, speech and language needs or a form of autism.

Schools can claim extra funds if pupils are classed as having certain types of educational needs, leading some education experts to call the SEN rise an ‘industry’.

St Rose’s wholly relies on the county council to cover its £2.16million a year running costs. It is estimated that the school  needs 60 to 70 pupils to survive – and those running it describe the financial situation as ‘scary’.

Sister Teresa Billington, a trustee and governor, said: ‘The nature of disability of the children we have has changed considerably over the 30 years I’ve been here.

'Before children were integrated into mainstream schools, most were in wheelchairs but had fairly mild disabilities and followed the usual curriculum.

‘As integration rose, we had a real change of children with much more profound and complex disability who could never cope in mainstream schools.

‘It would be very hard if the school closed. Parents would be devastated. I would be heartbroken.’

The school, owned by the Dominican Sisters charity, was described as ‘outstanding’ and ‘truly transformational’ in a recent inspection report.

Department of Education figures from earlier this year found 1.5million children at all schools were classed as SEN in January.

An Ofsted report two years ago said 450,000 children had been given the label to cover up poor teaching.
