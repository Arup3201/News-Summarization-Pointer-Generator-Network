Pine nuts have become a target for large-scale theft after poor harvests sent prices rocketing.

Italy in particular has seen a rise in pine-nut related crime, as the seed is a key ingredient in pesto.

Some supermarkets selling the little nuts in the country are even adding anti-theft devices to their stashes.

A gang of eight thieves recently raided a factory owned by Noberasco, a top wholesaler, and drove away with 7 tonnes of the nuts worth an estimated £300,000.

Two months earlier, an employee at the company was allegedly caught red-handed carrying 17kg of pine nuts out of the factory in a plastic bag.

Last week, a 23-year-old was arrested in Perugia in possession of €200 worth of stolen pine nuts. 

His two alleged accomplices, who were suspected of being involved in an earlier nut stealing incident, evaded police, but investigators told the Ansa news agency that they believed the suspects were stealing the nuts for sale on the black market.

The soaring price of the nuts over the last few years is seen as the chief motivator behind the thefts.

Wholesale prices have climbed to nearly £40 per kg owing to poor weather and a parasite that has hit pine trees in Italy and elsewhere in the Mediterranean.

A small 100g packet of pine nuts currently costs around £3.50 in British supermarkets.
