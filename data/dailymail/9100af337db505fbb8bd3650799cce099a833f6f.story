They kept the birth of their first child low key, not even posing for the traditional photographs outside the hospital.

But Zara Phillips and Mike Tindall have now made the surprisingly public move of selling the first pictures of their baby daughter Mia to Hello! magazine.

The Queen's fourth great-grandchild, who is 16th in line to the throne and was born on January 17, appears on the front cover of this week's edition.

Dressed in a white striped baby gro, Mia, awake and content, is pictured lying in front of her proud parents, who both looked relaxed and happy.Â 

The baby daughter of Zara Phillips made her first public appearance at the Barbury point-to-point races in Wiltshire, where two of her mother's horses were competing, but could not be seen inside her buggy, making the Hello! shoot the first time the latest edition to the royal family has been seen by the public.

A spokesman for Hello! magazine said: 'We are delighted that Zara and Mike Tindall chose to share their beautiful baby pictures with Hello!'

Buckingham
 Palace declined to comment on whether the Queen had been consulted over
 the photographs, which appear across 13 pages of the glossy magazine.

Olympic
 medal-winning sportswoman Zara and former England rugby star Tindall 
revealed that their daughter was 'pretty relaxed and happy so far'.

Mia, whose name was announced by her father via Twitter, was born in the NHS at the Gloucestershire Royal Hospital.

'We'd never even contemplated going privately,' the couple told the magazine.

Mia's second cousin Prince George - a future king - was born at the private Lindo Wing of St Mary's Hospital in Paddington, London.

Phillips has said she was hoping to resume her equestrian career and enter the Burghley Horse Trials in September but for now they were 'taking each day as it comes'.

Tindall, who was described by his wife as a hands on father, said: 'I still keeping looking at Mia and thinking "Oh! We made that!"'
