Spring cleaning the house burns more calories than running a marathon, according to new research.

But it seems housewives from the Fifties and Sixties have known this all along, if these vintage photographs are anything to go by. The collection of retro images, taken in Britain and Holland, depicts the original female multi-taskers: women exercising while cleaning their homes.

Like
 the eerily 'perfect' robotic wives from the 1975 black comedy The Stepford 
Wives, these women are literally bending over backwards to keep their houses tidy and their bodies trim.

A 1957 housewife multitasks by cleaning the doors while performing her daily stretches, left, and who needs a skipping rope or an aerobics step when you can improvise with a potato masher?

Good for reaching tins of tomatoes on the top shelf of the larder, kitchen steps are also handy for tightening up stomach muscles, as this 1963 housewife demonstrates

Wearing their trusty pinnies and using household props such as kitchen steps, mops, watering cans, carpet-beaters and even potato mashers, the home-bound women execute stretches and yoga positions to prove you don't need a gym membershp to stay in shape. You just need a good tea towel.

One blonde waters the garden while doing a high-kick, 
while a fellow wife performs a lunge while throwing out the rubbish.

Other
 pictures in the extraordinarily archaic series show one wife doing stretches while 
sponge-cleaning a door, and another young woman executing what 
appears to be a dolphin yoga pose... at the same time as mopping the 
floor.

The pictures, from 
an archive on lifestyles of the mid-20th Century show how females coped 
with the pressures of being the perfect domestic goddesses their era 
demanded.

A woman in 1959 uses her trusty tea towel to carry out her daily stretches, left, and keeping the house clean affords this young wife plenty of opportunities to keep her body looking tidy, too, right

The Stepford wife workout attire gets its inspiration more from ballet than boxercise, with tights, gold slippers and neat buns being order of the day... along with a trusty pinnie

Taking out the bins has never been so much fun, left, and banish dust, cobwebs and bingo wings in one fell swoop, right

One wife decides that raking leaves is very much a man's game, and that she will instead use the gardening tool for a Pilates-style workout of her lower abs

Why simply water the plants when you can water the plants AND tone up your leg muscles?

Before exercise videos and Skyped legs, bums'n'tums sessions, there was radio yoga... done in your nightie

Use your imagination to see the alternative uses in your household cleaning implements... just as this young woman has turned her mop into stretching pole

Long skirts may not initially seem an entirely practical choice of clothing when exercising, but this Fifties wife proves there are still many ways to stretch your body in somewhat restrictive dress

A Fifties housewife proudly wields her carpet-beater, preparing to banish bingo wings and dust mites
