A terrorist who killed himself and dozens of Syrians in a bomb attack is a father of three from West Sussex.

Abdul Waheed Majeed, 41, joined Al Qaeda-inspired militants after travelling from his home town of Crawley in what he said was an aid convoy.

The devout Muslim, who left for the war-torn state six months ago, regularly spoke to his wife and children through the internet phone service, Skype. But yesterday his family revealed he died at the wheel of a lorry bomb driven into a prison in Aleppo a week ago.

As
 well as killing dozens, the attack allowed hundreds of inmates to 
escape.

Abdul Waheed Majeed, from Crawley, who is suspected of being a suicide bomber in Syria

Probe: Counter-terrorism officers are examining this house in Martyrs Avenue, Langley Green, Crawley, West Sussex, after reports that a UK jihadi, understood to be Abdul Waheed Majid, 41, carried out a deadly bombing in Syria

It also emerged last night that Majeed was a friend of Omar 
Khyam, who is serving life for a bomb plot that targeted UK shopping 
centres and nightclubs.

Majeed’s death has renewed concerns from UK 
security services that jihadis returning from the Syrian conflict could 
turn their anger on Britain. In other developments:

Majeed
 is the first Briton to undertake a suicide bomb mission overseas since 
an attack in Tel Aviv 11 years ago. Three died when Asif Mohammed Hanif,
 from London, detonated his device outside a beach café in 2003.

History: The end-of terraced house in Crawley was once the home of schoolgirl Sarah Payne's killer Roy Whiting, according to neighbours

Footage
 posted online of the run-up to Majeed’s attack last Thursday showed a 
man with his fist raised in the air on top of the lorry bomb.

The deadly vehicle was draped in the flags of Jabhat Al Nusra, an extremist faction aligned to Al Qaeda.

The militant group announced the man responsible was a Briton known as Abu Suleiman Al Britani.

Police
 and MI5 suspect this was a nom de guerre for Majeed, who has not 
contacted his family since the outrage. They may not be able to formally
 confirm his death because his remains have not been recovered.

Majeed, who was born in Britain, is believed to have worked for a contractor employed by the Highways Agency.

He
 left his council home in Martyrs Avenue, Langley Green, six months ago 
to join an Aid 2 Syria convoy organised by his local mosque.

He 
regularly called his wife Tahmina, who neighbours said worked part time 
at a cinema, and their two boys, aged 18 and 16, and daughter of 12.

Relatives
 said Majeed was ‘quite happy’ and even turned down opportunities to 
return home as he repeatedly extended his stay at a camp on the Turkish 
border.

But he mysteriously cut off contact around seven days ago after telling his loved ones he was moving to another camp.

Investigators
 are now examining potential links between Majeed and extremists in 
Crawley, which is known for its links to Islamic terrorism.

In 2007, 
five men were jailed for up to 20 years over Khyam’s fertiliser bomb 
plot which targeted Bluewater shopping centre and the Ministry of Sound 
nightclub. Sources said Majeed attended an Islamic study circle with 
Khyam. Two other Langley Green residents – Waheed Mahmood and Jawad 
Akbar – were also convicted after Britain’s biggest terrorism trial.

Sources
 said Majeed may have travelled to Syria with the brother of one of the 
fertiliser plotters. MI5 is also understood to be investigating whether 
he attended a terror training camp in Pakistan in the late 1990s.

Last
 night, Ahsan Ahmedi, of the Ahmadiyya Muslim Association, said Majeed 
was a mentor to radical youths who followed Al-Muhajiroun.

The banned group was founded by hate preachers Omar Bakri Muhammad and Anjem Choudary.

Mr
 Ahmedi said: ‘They were aggressive – there’s no doubt about that. They 
supported jihad whereas we believe in a peaceful Islam.

Cut off: Mr Syed said Majeed would phone or Skype his family every three days, but communication was lost with him about seven days ago

‘They didn’t recognise us as Muslims as we’re Ahmadiyya muslims and would call us kaffirs (non-believers).

‘They used to come to our stalls, create a ruckus and stop people from talking to us. They were there to cause a disruption.’

He
 said the men were normally foul mouthed and abusive but Majeed appeared
 to have a calming influence on them at one event last July. Majeed’s 
uncle, Mohammad Jamil, 65, said the explosion ‘started alarm bells’ 
among the family last weekend.

But he said counter-terrorism detectives have not been able to find out for certain what has happened.

He
 added that Tahmina had been left in a ‘totally confused state’ by the 
conflicting reports of her husband’s fate. Speaking at Langley Green 
Mosque, he said no one recognised the name Abu Suleiman Al Britani. ‘If 
the family knew about this, we wouldn’t have let him go,’ he added.

‘The family has been in constant touch with him for several weeks, and he has been sending photographs.

‘He
 has mostly been working with a charity on the refugee camps and 
distributing aid which he has collected from here and other towns in the
 UK.

‘He was quite happy and enjoying this piece of work. We had communication until about seven days ago.

‘He had said he was going to another camp and there might be switch-off with the communication, which has happened before.

‘He
 said, “If I don’t contact you for a few days, don’t worry about it, I 
will be in touch again”. That’s the last communication we had. People go
 out there for humanitarian works. You don’t have to be religious you 
know, it’s just human nature.

‘If you’ve got any humanity and if you
 are touched by it then you like to do something. And he was one of 
those who took this step.’

Community leader Arif Syed said there was still some hope that Majeed was not behind the suicide bombings.

‘We
 are praying that he will walk through the door. It’s a good possibility
 that he’s still alive and well, and is just not communicating,’ he 
said.

But Abdul Jabbar, who is also a Syrian aid worker based in 
Bradford, has started raising money to support Majeed’s wife and 
children.

Writing online, he said: ‘A personal friend of mine . . . 
was martyred freeing the prisoners of Aleppo. What a beautiful action he
 did and sacrificed his wife and three children for the sake of Allah.’ 
Neighbours described Majeed as a ‘pleasant chap’ who was always willing 
to help and volunteered to trim everyone’s hedges.

Andrew Powell, 62,
 who lives opposite, said: ‘I was shocked because he seemed like a 
normal guy, a family man. He was a very jovial chap, you’d see him 
joking around with people – a bit of a Jack the lad.

‘He was really 
into his car and would wash it every Sunday. Before he left in the 
summer I saw that he had put his car up for sale.’

Occupant: The house is believed to be the childhood home of convicted child killer Roy Whiting who is serving a life sentence for the murder of Sarah Payne

Past: A neighbour said that the house's current occupant, believed to be Majid, had moved in after Roy Whiting's father left the property. Pictured is Whiting in 2001

Mr Powell said police searched the property ‘two or three years ago’ and have also visited in recent weeks.

Nita
 Bateman, 55, said: ‘I’m beginning to wonder whether it’s something to 
do with that house. He was the next person to move in after Roy 
Whiting’s dad moved out.’

They said the Majeeds have lived there for
 at least 12 years and their sons attended Hazelwick School in Crawley. 
The town’s MP Henry Smith said the case was ‘very concerning’ and 
highlighted the dangers of travelling to Syria.

‘Crawley has very 
good community relations involving people of different faiths but it is 
particularly shocking if someone from the town is involved in 
radicalisation,’ he added.

Although Majeed was born in Britain, there is no record of his marriage or the birth of two of his children in this country.

Sixteen
 people were arrested in January on suspicion of terror offences after 
travelling between Syria and the UK. The border between Syria and Turkey
 is under intense scrutiny by Western intelligence agencies, because it 
is seen as the likely source of the next deadly attack on the West.

An
 ‘unprecedented’ spying effort is under way to monitor the flow of 
foreign fighters – many British – heading in to Syria to join the jihad.

Earlier
 this month James Clapper, the US director of national intelligence, 
said there was evidence that one Al Qaeda group in Syria had ambitions 
to strike in America.

Options include placing suspects under intensive surveillance or applying for a terrorism prevention order.
