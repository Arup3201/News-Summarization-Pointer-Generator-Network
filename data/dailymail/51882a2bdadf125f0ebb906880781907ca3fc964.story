Mauro Zarate has agreed a move to West Ham from Velez Sarsfield as Sam Allardyce begins adding more firepower to his beleaguered Hammers.

The Argentinian striker has penned a three-year deal at Upton Park and will sign the contract in London on Tuesday.

Zarate - who was top scorer in Argentina last season - revealed he has spoken to Carlos Tevez and Javier Mascherano ahead of his return to the Premier League. The 27-year-old had a spell on loan at Birmingham in 2008.

'It's a new chance for me. West Ham called me. They are a fierce team and now I think I want to play (there),' he told Sky Sports News.

West Ham boss Allardyce was told he must
 excite fans next season after keeping his job, and the arrival of Zarate
 is sure to set pulses racing in the East End.

Zarate was signed by West Ham’s owners David Sullivan and David Gold when they were at the helm at St Andrew’s with Birmingham back in 2008.

He scored four goals in 14 outings but a permanent deal failed to materialise after Birmingham were relegated from the Premier League.

He went on to move to Serie A where he had spells with Lazio and Inter Milan. It was in Italy he met wife Natalie and they married in Buenos Aires in 2011 before his return to Velez two years later.

Zarate, 
who plays best in an attacking left-sided role, was among a host of 
targets for West Ham this summer with manager Allardyce given a budget 
of £20million to spend.

Free
 agents Joleon Lescott and Martin Olsson are wanted by the 59-year-old 
boss, as he looks to beef up his defence for next season.
