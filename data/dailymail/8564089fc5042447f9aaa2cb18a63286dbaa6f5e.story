Higher education reminds many of gruelling hours in the library, re-heating Pot Noodles and grubby student pubs.

Additional culinary adventures are determined by what can be found in the supermarket’s reduced section rather than by what you fancy for dinner.

However, the students at High Point University are having a rather different experience.

Studying hard: A student relaxes in a hammock on the Disney World-style campus of High Point University in North Carolina which boasts a cinema, a first-class restaurant and an arcade

Tough times: When exam pressure gets too tough on High Point students, they can relax by the swimming pool. Or the hot tub. Or in the cinema

University utopia: The college experience at High Point is worlds away compared to what most university students enjoy during their years in higher education

The campus, located in High Point, North Carolina, has more resemblance to a theme park than a traditional university, and boasts amenities you are more likely to find at a high-end hotel than at a school.

Aside from the jaw-dropping buildings, a result of more than $700million worth of refurbishing, the campus also has swimming pools, top-end sports facilities and a first-class restaurant where students can enjoy one free five-course meal per week.

The cinema, which shows features straight out of the high-street movie theatres, does not only screen for free, but also offer students complimentary popcorn, sweets and soft drinks.

Should students be so inclined, there is an arcade, a putting green, a sports bar and even an ice cream truck - all of this for no monies.

High Point's 'Greek Village' - a $19million fraternity and sorority complex, ensures that hard-working students can relax in outdoor hot tubs. However, when that is not enough to combat exam stress, High Point brings in masseuses and puppy therapy.

Shine on: The campus has been improved with the help of $700million in refurbishments

Not exactly noodles: At the on-campus restaurant 1924 PRIME, High Point students enjoy a five-course meal once a week

Good game: The campus also has an arcade - but not even the machines in the gaming hall costs the students anything

Fore: Students hoping to improve their short game need to look no further than the college's putting green

It is all thanks to the university’s president, Dr Nido R Qubein, a millionaire entrepreneur who took over the campus eight years ago.

After managing to raise millions to clean up the campus and build new facilities, he now dedicates his life to leading the university.

In a Biography Channel documentary about his journey, Jordan-born Dr Qubein says: ‘I'm in the business of planting seeds of greatness in the minds and also in the hearts and souls of our students.’

'All the lessons I have learned in my life, I now bring them to a university campus.’

His work has not been for nothing, although tuition and living costs has gone up by 60 per cent, enrolment is up by 50 per cent and the average SAT score of students at High Point is ten per cent higher than eight years ago.

Last year Dr Qubein told Business Week he plans improvements costing $2.1billion by 2020, including a new sports arena.

Fresh paint: Although the exteriors of many of the buildings are historic, when Dr Qubein took over as president, they received complete interior refurbishments

Green surroundings: Since the pricey refurbishment, costs of tuition, room and board has gone up by 60 per cent
