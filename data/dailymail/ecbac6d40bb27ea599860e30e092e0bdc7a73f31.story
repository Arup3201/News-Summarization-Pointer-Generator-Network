With thousands of anti-abortion protesters in town for the annual March for Life, Republicans were ready to push legislation through the House designed to please them.

GOP leaders had planned House passage Thursday of legislation criminalizing most abortions after 20 weeks of pregnancy, an act that would have defied a White House veto threat. 

But late Wednesday they abruptly postponed that confrontation indefinitely after concluding they were short of votes from their own caucus, after several women pushed back on a provision that would have required rape and incest victims seeking an abortion after 20 weeks to first report the crime to the police.

Instead, the House will vote on legislation today barring taxpayer funding of abortions — a prohibition that's already largely in place. Republicans say the bill will tighten the restrictions and make sure no funds flow to abortions under President Barack Obama's health care law.

Anti-abortion activists stage a 'die-in' in front of the White House on Wednesday. Today marks the 42nd anniversary of the Roe v. Wade decision in 1973 that established a nationwide right to abortion. Every anniversary anti-abortion activists flood D.C. and embark on a march from the National Mall to the Supreme Court in protest of court ruling

The delayed bill would have allowed exemptions to the late-term abortion ban for victims of rape or incest and in cases when a woman's life was in danger. 

But GOP leaders ran into problems when some GOP women, including Rep. Rene Ellmers of North Carolina and Rep. Jackie Walorski of Indiana, and other lawmakers argued that requiring victims to contact the police put unfair pressure on those who have already suffered. 

A 2013 Justice Department report calculated that only 35 percent of rapes and sexual assaults were reported to police. The statistics also served as the basis for the White House's veto threat. 

Political pressures cut both ways for Republicans. 

Leaders had resisted the awkwardness of postponing a high-profile abortion vote scheduled for the day of anti-abortion activists' annual march to the Supreme Court to protest its 1973 decision legalizing the procedure.

And they didn't want to push anti-abortion legislation through the House that was opposed by GOP women, especially as the party tries appealing to more female voters ahead of the 2016 elections.

Yet when the leaders considered eliminating the requirement that rapes and incest be previously reported, they encountered objections from anti-abortion groups, Republican aides said. They chose not to anger that powerful GOP constituency.

The breakdown showcased GOP leaders' struggles to keep its members united the Republican-led Congress attempts to govern efficiently and avoid gridlock.

'I’m honestly stunned — what a complete and utter debacle,' one conservative lawmaker who planned to vote for the postponed bill told National Review Online.

'I don't see it as a failure. I see it as a victory in the process for getting legislation right,' Tennessee Rep. Marsha Blackburn, a sponsor of the postponed bill, said in an interview with the AP.

Tony Perkins, president of the conservative Family Research Council, expressed disappointment that 'a handful'  of lawmakers had forced a delay in the late-term abortion restrictions but added, 'We applaud the leadership for remaining committed to advancing pro-life legislation.'

Perkins made a last-minute visit to the Capitol on Wednesday to meet with Republicans' chief vote counter.

The conservative big wig told the Washington Post  that a 'lot of misconceptions' were involved in the kerfuffle. 

'We’re talking about a measure that would limit abortions after five months,' he said. 'America is only one of four nations that allows abortions throughout the entire pregnancy.'

Progressive groups and a handful of Democratic lawmakers that included Sens. Barbara Boxer of California, Patty Murray of Washington and Richard Blumenthal of Connecticut, held a press conference on Wednesday to denounce 'Republican attacks on women's health' and the House's plans to vote on 'an extreme abortion ban.'

After House Republicans backtracked, congressional Democrats who solidly oppose the legislation, along with abortion-rights advocates, all but mocked the GOP's problem.

Massachusetts Rep. Jim McGovern said Republicans suffered 'a meltdown.'

Cecile Richards, president of Planned Parenthood Action Fund, said of the bill, 'These attacks are so dangerous, extreme and unpopular that House Republicans can't even get their membership lined up behind them.'

The National Organization for Women celebrated the victory in an email to supporters on Thursday, claiming GOP had to 'pull that bill because even members in their own party thought it was too extreme!'

Referencing the legislation that the House plans to pass instead, NOW insisted 'they haven't learned their lesson - they are still trying to strip women of their rights.'

House Minority Leader Nancy Pelosi told reporters this morning that the new bill, banning health insurance funds from being spent on abortion, is 'much worse' than the legislation Republicans originally intended to pass today because it affects millions of women instead of thousands.

'This isn't about any improvement because of the actions that were taken yesterday,' she said. 'It makes matters worse.' 

Pelosi said the legislation 'undermines the ability of of a woman to use her own money from her own insurance' to pay for her own reproductive services.

'This was not a success for women and their reproductive health,' she said.

The 20 week abortion band had virtually no chance of becoming law, thanks to opposition from President Barack Obama and an uncertain fate in the Senate, where anti-abortion sentiment is less pronounced. 

The White House said Wednesday it was advising the president to veto the bill because it 'unacceptably restrict women's health and reproductive rights and is an assault on a woman's right to choose.'

'Furthermore, the provision that requires rape and incest survivors to report the crime to a law enforcement agency or child welfare authority in order to have access to an abortion after the 20-week mark demonstrates a complete disregard for the women who experience sexual assault and the barriers they may face in reporting,' it said in a statement of administration policy.

'Research indicates that the majority of survivors have not reported their sexual assaults to law enforcement.'

House Republicans consider the bill an important statement of their priorities and a show of support for a vital issue for conservatives, though, and were ready to press on, despite threats from the White House.

Supporters named their measure the Pain-Capable Unborn Child Protection Act. But Democrats touted arguments by doctors' groups like the American Congress of Obstetricians and Gynecologists, which have cited research indicating that fetuses are unlikely to feel pain until the third trimester, which starts around the 28th week.

And a report Tuesday by the nonpartisan Congressional Budget Office suggested that the majority of women now having abortions after five weeks would move up their timeline instead of abandoning the procedure altogether.

Citing the federal Centers for Disease Control and Prevention, CBO estimated that about 10,000 abortions annually are performed 20 weeks or later into pregnancies. The budget office estimated that if the bill became law, three-fourths of those abortions would instead occur before the 20th week.
