The Immigration and Customs Enforcement Agency released more than 600 criminal aliens into the U.S. amid a budget shortfall in 2013, an audit of the department released today revealed.

The year-long investigation found that ICE released 2,226 illegal immigrants in February 2013 just before the sequestration went into effect in an effort to cut costs.

On the weekend of February 23 alone, the inspector general report says ICE released 1,450 illegal immigrants.

Conservative news website The Daily Signal, which first obtained the audit, reports that 617 of the aliens released were criminals whose detention was mandatory.

The surge of Central Americans illegally entering the country throughout the last two years has overwhelmed Immigration Customs and Enforcement officials. An audit of ICE found that it released 2,226 detainees, including 617 criminals, last year in the face of a budget shortfall

The Houston and Phoenix areas saw the largest number of criminals releases, while the largest total number of immigrant releases occurred in the Phoenix and San Diego areas

The Houston and Phoenix areas saw the largest number of criminals releases, while the largest total number of immigrant releases occurred in the Phoenix and San Diego areas.

Immigration officials 'did not release aliens they considered a danger to the community,' however, the audit states.

While ICE initially told Congress that the releases were tied to budget cuts caused by the sequestration the Department of Homeland Security's Office of Inspector General says the agency was already facing a $90 million budget shortfall.

'ICE did not anticipate the potential consequences of its decision to release 1,450 immigration detainees over one weekend,' the watchdog agency's report states. 'As a result, ICE was unprepared to respond to congressional inquiries about the detainee releases and provided incorrect data.'

According to the report, ICE secretly ran into financial trouble after the U.S. border with Mexico began being inundated by Central American immigrants.

Between fiscal year 2011 and 2012 the 
number of illegal immigrants captured in the Rio Grande Valley area of 
Texas rose by 66 percent, the report states.Â 

'ICE executive leadership did not plan adequately for increased Border Patrol apprehensions on the southern border in the Rio Grande Valley,' the audit found.

Compounding the issue is that the same area saw a 139 
percent increase in non-Mexican arrivals.

Non-Mexican immigrants take longer for ICE to process because they must have certain travel documents and have to be flown home. Mexican immigrants can be immediately deported and bused home.

Congress requires ICE to be able to hold 34,000 immigrants at all times, but only provides funding for 31,300 detainees, or beds, as immigration officials say. The rest of ICE's funding comes from other, less reliable means, the report explains.

'This funding structure leaves ICE with inadequate resources when there is an increase in detainees,' it said, noting in its recommendations that ICE needs to request of Congress funding for the total amount of beds it needs.

The IG audit state that each bed costs ICE $122 a day, or $4.15 million a day or 34,000 detainees. If ICE maintains the bare minimum detainee population at its facilities, that makes for a grand total of $1.5 billion a year.

Deporting non-Mexican illegal immigrants takes longer, causing pile ups at ICE detention centers

The influx of illegal immigrants put ICE over its legally required capacity at 35,610 beds at the beginning of 2013, causing a budget shortfall just as additional budget cuts from sequestration were scheduled to kick in.

ICE had intended to meet its budgetary obligations by releasing even more illegal immigrants and reducing it's number of detainees to 25,700, but Congress informed the agency of the 34,000 requirement.

The Office of Inspector General says that ICE then asked the Office of Management and Budget for $22 million in additional funding, but before it could make a final decision ICE secretly released the 2,226 illegal immigrants without permission from its parent agency, the Department of Homeland Security.

Because ICE's 'detention population included few
 detainees whose detention was not mandatory and who did not have 
criminal convictions,' many criminals were included in the release, the Inspector General audit released today found.

Other non-criminals 'were not suitable for release' the report said.

'This 
caseload included national security and extradition cases, aliens 
awaiting sentencing in criminal cases, and aliens already scheduled for 
removal'

After the initial release, ICE reportedly redetained 54 aliens but did not say why.

The Associated Press first reported the massive discharge of detainees in early March, a charge that Homeland Security Secretary Janet Napolitano denied, claiming that hundreds, not thousands, of aliens were released.

Later that month, ICE director John Morton publicly admitted that the number did run in the thousands.

'We were trying to live within the budget that Congress had provided us,' he told Congress. 'This was not a White House call. I take full responsibility.'
