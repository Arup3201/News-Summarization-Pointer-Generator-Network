A man has been charged with the murders of his mother and sister after their bodies were found at home along with their slaughtered pet dog.

Alice McMeekin, 58, and her university student daughter, Katie Jenkin, 20, were discovered at the family home in Millom, Cumbria, on Saturday morning, having suffered head injuries.

Their pet collie, Fenn, was also killed. John Jenkin, 23, who was arrested shortly after, is accused of murder and animal cruelty. He is due to appear at Furness District Magistrates’ Court today.

Death: Alice McMeekin, 58, and her daughter, Katie Jenkin (left), 20, were found dead at the family home in Millom, Cumbria, having suffered head injuries. John Jenkin (right), 23, was arrested shortly after

Friends and neighbours were shocked by the deaths of the animal-loving divorced mother of two and her daughter, who was studying in South Wales and had been on a weekend visit home.

Mrs McMeekin was brought up in Millom and moved to Merthyr Tydfil, South Wales, four years ago, but returned to her home town with Mr Jenkin 12 weeks ago.

She worked for the prison service and ‘would do anything for anybody’, according to a friend.

Miss Jenkin, who was in a steady 
relationship with a boyfriend, stayed in Wales to continue her media 
studies course. ‘She was a happy, beautiful girl with the world in front
of her,’ said the friend.

She recalled chatting on Friday to Mrs McMeekin, who was looking forward to her daughter’s visit.

’Twenty-three-year-old John Jenkin, of Newton Street, Millom, has been charged with the murder of Alice McMeekin and the murder of Kathryn Jenkin.

'He has also been charged with animal cruelty.'

Police also confirmed that the two bodies were discovered at 8:39am on Saturday on Newton Street.
