The Harry Kane show continues at Tottenham. His first Premier League hat-trick against Leicester on Saturday ensured Spurs stayed in the hunt for a top-four finish.

It's 29 for the season now. Will he score his first for England in the coming days?

After another virtuoso display, in front of Roy Hodgson, he'll almost certainly be presented with his England debut.

Tottenham manager Mauricio Pochettino believes that Kane has kept his head on his shoulders

Harry Kane is the first Spurs player to score a Premier League hat-trick since Gareth Bale in December 2012.

It's keeping your feet on the floor time for Tottenham's talisman after a fairytale breakthrough campaign.

When he trains alongside Wayne Rooney and Co for the first time this week you'd forgive Kane if his ego inflates somewhat.

However, his club manager Mauricio Pochettino insists there's no danger of Kane turning into a Big Time Charlie.

'I think he's a very humble person,' said the Argentine. 'From the beginning of the season I think he impressed us with his human side. His mentality is that he always wants to improve, he never complains.

'I think it's a perfect mentality to develop his skill. You can it feel from the beginning with some people, they're are humble and they improve.

'Kane has the right mentality. I think always our job is to try to improve our players but Harry Kane is Harry Kane because he's Harry Kane.'

Kane's superb form for Tottenham this season has culminated in a first call-up to the senior England squad 

If he scores again, Kane would be the first Spurs player to score 30 goals in a season since Jurgen Klinsman

Pochettino's chirpiness is likely to subside should his striker pick up an injury during the international break.

Kane, obviously, will be vital to Pochettino as his side continue with their Champions League charge.

Barring a miraculous dip in form or injury, Kane is virtually certain to become the first Spurs player to score 30 goals in a season since Jurgen Klinsmann during the 1994-95 season.

Surely individual honours await Kane, even if Champions League football doesn't. 

'Can Kane win the player of the year? I don't know, I think Harry is today, a player who people prize a lot,' said Pochettino.

Following his hat-trick against Leicester on Saturday, Kane was awarded with the match ball

'I think that this season Harry has a big impact in the English football. I think that he's one of the better English players so far.

'He works hard, he's improved his game and is always available in the training. Harry Kane deserves his moment.

'Am I worried about him picking up an injury on England duty? No, I think it's a very good thing for him. It's a very good moment to be in national team.'

Pochettino, however, is concerned about the fitness of his goalkeeper Hugo Lloris who needed stitches in a knee wound following a hefty collision with team-mate Kyle Walker in the second minute on Saturday.

Spurs medical staff will make checks on the wound this week but the injury will rule him out of France's games against Brazil and Denmark.

Though the keeper's wife, Marine Lloris, eased fears that the keeper will face long spell on the sidelines by tweeting: 'Hugo needs to rest bit but he will be back really soon.'
