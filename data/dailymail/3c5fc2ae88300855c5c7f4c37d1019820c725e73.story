An Illinois couple say People magazine rejected the wife's entry into a beauty contest because she was holding a gun in her entry shot.

Sandra Ferris posed with a .45 caliber Colt for her husband Bob Ferris's impromptu photoshoot, and the couple sent the resulting glamor shots to People magazine's Real Beauty at Every Age contest.

They were rejected on the basis of one of three possible reasons: size, focus or inappropriate content.

Bob Ferris says he was shocked that the magazine rejected a woman of his wife's caliber for exercising her Second Amendment rights in the shots.

The Ferrises told WBTV that Bob Ferris was inspired to take the photos after his wife returned home from church one Sunday looking sinfully attractive. For some, he added the deadly prop.

'It was my husand's idea,' Sandra Ferris said.

'I don't think there is anything more beautiful than a woman holding a handgun,' Bob Ferris told WBTV.

The couple didn't want to go off half-cocked, though.

They entered another shot, this time of Sandra Ferris making eyes at the camera over a pistol, to ensure that it was, in fact, the gun that was the problem.

That too was rejected.

A third, weaponless, shot hit the target and was accepted by People.

'I don't see anything wrong with the picture and the pose and women with guns,' says Sandra Ferris.

'Guns are a part of our lives,' her husband says.

The couple didn't elaborate on how a deadly weapon is relevant to a beauty contest, but hopefully an angry email to People is all they'll fire off.
