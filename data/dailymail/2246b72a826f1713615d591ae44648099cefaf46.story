A long-serving star of television police drama The Bill has died after a suspected suicide.

Colin Tarrant, 59, who played Inspector Andrew Monroe in the ITV series, was found in the bathroom of his Bristol home.

The details of how he died are not yet known, but reports said he was found with knife wounds.

Shock: Colin Tarrant, who played Andrew Monroe in The Bill, has died following a suspected suicide

His son Juma Woodhouse, 24,  is 
understood to have rushed to  his dying father’s bedside in Bristol 
Royal Infirmary, where he was  pronounced dead on Thursday.  In a 
statement, Mr Woodhouse  said his father had died ‘suddenly’ but did not
reveal any other details of his death.

The statement said: ‘Colin was best known as Inspector Andrew Monroe in The Bill, a part he played very happily for many years.

Tragic: Colin Tarrant was found in his Bristol home. His son rushed to his bedside as doctors battled to save his life

‘Since leaving the series he has 
triumphed on stage as Brian Clough in The Spirit Of The Man and had 
recently played John in the enormously successful stage production of 
Calendar Girls, to which he would have returned this autumn.’

Mr Tarrant separated from his wife 
Patricia Woodhouse more than a decade ago, but the two were said to have
remained friends. Last night their son, who lives in East London with 
his partner Sabrina and their baby son Louis, said his family were too 
upset to comment further.

Mr Tarrant appeared in nearly 600 
episodes of The Bill, which was axed in 2010. His character was killed 
off in a storyline in 2002 when a fire engulfed Sun Hill station. The 
actor later appeared in shows including Heartbeat, Holby City, Casualty 
and Midsomer Murders.

Last night his agent Dennis Lyne said:
‘It’s a shock and very sad. It has happened very suddenly. I don’t want
to say any more at this time – it’s all a bit raw at the moment.’

Former Bill stars paid tribute to Mr 
Tarrant on Twitter. Jeff Stewart, who played PC Reg Hollis, wrote: 
‘Shocked by sudden news of Colin Tarrant’s death. A lovely man who was a
greatly admired colleague.’

Troubled: Jeff Stewart, left, who played PC Reg Hollis in The Bill, attempted to kill himself in 2008. Kevin Lloyd, right, played Tosh Lines and died in 1998 one week after he was sacked from the show

And Andrew Lancel, who played 
Detective Inspector Neil Manson, said: ‘Very sad to hear about Colin 
Tarrant. A huge part of The Bill. We never worked together but Inspector
Monroe was iconic to Bill fans.’

West End theatre producer David Pugh said: ‘Colin was a lovely man, he loved the theatre, his politics and his family.’

Mr Tarrant’s death is one of a number of tragedies to affect actors who appeared in The Bill.

Mr Stewart tried to kill himself in 
2008 when his character was written out after 24 years. He slashed his 
wrists in his dressing room.

And in 1998 Kevin Lloyd, who played 
Tosh Lines, died a week after being sacked for turning up to work drunk 
and not learning his lines. He had been receiving treatment for 
alcoholism.
