Chelsea Martin managed to keep her hair whilst having chemotherapy for breast cancer

With not one, but two, requests to be a bridesmaid for close friends, Chelsea Martin had every intention of looking her absolute best as she walked down the aisle at each wedding.

And a major preoccupation was what to do with her hair.

Her concern went beyond which style to go for. Facing gruelling chemotherapy treatment for breast cancer, her worry was whether she would have any hair at all. 'As a cancer patient, your first concern is: 'Will this disease kill me?' ', explains Chelsea, 30, an advertising manager who lives in London with her boyfriend.

'But what can make things so much harder is the fact that when you lose your hair, you look like a cancer patient. I didn't want pitying looks.

'I didn't want anyone who wasn't close to me knowing I had the disease or was undergoing treatment. When you look normal, you feel so much better. It's such a morale boost to go out and find no one treats you any differently.'

With the weddings looming just months after she started chemotherapy in May, Chelsea was persuaded to try 'scalp cooling' to help her retain her shoulder length, strawberry blonde hair.

Chemotherapy works by attacking rapidly dividing cells - that is, cancer cells. However, healthy cells that also divide rapidly can be affected, including cells in the stomach (which is why chemo can cause nausea), and the hair follicles - the tiny openings in the skin that produce hair.

If the amount of chemotherapy drugs reaching the follicles can be reduced - especially during the peak period of treatment a couple of hours after chemo has started - there is a chance the hair is less likely to fall out, explains Dr Craig Macmillan, a consultant clinical oncologist at Northampton General Hospital.

Scalp cooling or 'cold cap' treatment involves wearing a lightweight silicone cap that's connected to either a small refrigeration unit or filled with a liquid cooling gel, both of which can reduce the temperature of the scalp to around -4c, to reduce blood flow to the scalp.

The cold cap is placed on the patient's head about an hour before chemotherapy begins - it's worn throughout the session while the drug is being given, as well as for an hour afterwards as the drugs may still be circulating in the blood (there are no long-term health effects but some users may experience headaches).

The treatment isn't guaranteed to stop hair falling out - and even for patients who keep the majority of their hair, some follicles can still be damaged by the chemo drugs, leading to some hair loss, or thinning hair.

The cap is worn during each chemo session - Chelsea had the treatment during all six rounds of her chemotherapy, for four hours a time, over four-and-a-half months - and it worked. She was able to wear her hair long for one of the weddings, and up for the other.

'I just loved every moment being a bridesmaid,' she says. 'My boyfriend says he would love me any way I looked, but it meant so much to me that we could go on dates and that I could feel pretty.

'It may not be for everyone. But for me it meant I could go on with day-to-day life without being reminded that I had cancer.'

Research published by the United States National Library of Medicine found that 47 per cent of female patients considered hair loss the most traumatic aspect of chemotherapy.

Yet according to the breast cancer charity Walk the Walk, which has been raising money to place scalp coolers in all UK hospitals, many are unaware this technology exists, even though it's available in many areas (although there aren't enough devices nationally to offer all patients who might need them).

There needs to be far greater encouragement of the use of the cold cap, where appropriate, adds Justin Stebbing, professor of cancer medicine at Imperial College, London. 'We need to raise awareness that it's the little things that make people feel better.

'It's something women should at least be given the option of trying, since clearly in some cases it does work and with minimal additional cost to the hospital,' he says.

For patients who keep the majority of their hair, some follicles can still be damaged by the chemo drugs 

When Michaela Beth, 37, a mother-of-four from Leeds, had chemotherapy for breast cancer last year, she says she wasn't given any encouragement to use the cold cap - though she knew about it after researching on the internet. 'I was told that for every symptom I had such as nausea, the hospital could help me - with the exception of hair loss,' she says.

'When I broached the cold cap, I was shown it in a cupboard and told by the breast care nurses: 'You don't really want to use that. It's so freezing cold and it's not always effective. So why put yourself through it?' '

In fact, a 2012 review of 1,411 breast cancer patients found that around 50 per cent retained enough hair during their treatment that they didn't feel the need to cover their heads.

Michaela continues: 'At the time, I was feeling pretty vulnerable and looking back I simply didn't have the determination to pursue the cold cap. So I lost my hair after the second session, which was awful. Your morale just drops through the floor and it was frightening for my children.

'It would have been nice if someone could have encouraged me to at least try it.'

The cold cap isn't suitable for patients whose disease is at an advanced stage and has spread significantly, says Dr Macmillan. 'There is a very remote chance that cancer cells may have escaped to the scalp and if you cool the scalp they could be sheltered there. And in theory, once the treatment stops, the cancer cells could move and grow elsewhere.'

For similar reasons, it's not used for patients with blood cancers, such as leukaemia, as the cancer is circulating around the body. Nor is it suitable for those having continuous chemotherapy over several days, as it's impractical to keep the scalp cooler on so long.

Chelsea had the treatment during all six rounds of her chemotherapy - and it worked

Chelsea had never heard of the cold cap until she was diagnosed with grade 3 aggressive cancer having noticed a thickening in her right breast a few months earlier.

'It was a terrible shock as I was young, fit and there was no disease in my family,' she says. 'There was so much to take in, but among the things I read was something about the cold cap.

'I've always had a lot of hair, and at the London Oncology Clinic, where I was due to have my chemotherapy, they were very encouraging of using the cold cap.'

The treatment wasn't entirely comfortable, she says: 'It was absolutely freezing - almost like a burning sensation, or that kind of 'brain freeze' feeling you get when you eat very cold food.' Despite having a heating pad and heavy blankets for her four-hour treatment, she was still 'desperately cold, and my head felt like a block of ice, but I coped'. Chelsea's hair did become a little thinner, but not noticeably so.

So why isn't the cold cap more widely used?

A review found that around 50 per cent retained enough hair using a scalp cooler, such as the one pictured

Professor Stebbing says it may be because patients have to spend longer in the chemotherapy department and some departments don't have the capacity as there are too many patients.

Also, he says: 'It can be painful and uncomfortable and perhaps that deters some centres from encouraging use of it.'

And when it doesn't work, the disappointment can be crushing. When Debbie Madison, 44, a sales assistant from Hale, Cheshire, was diagnosed with breast cancer in 2010, the first thing she asked her oncologist was whether she would lose her hair.

Told that she would, she immediately asked about the cold cap, having heard about it from a friend.

'The hospital was happy for me to give it a try. Their approach was, well we doubt it'll work, but have a go.

'It was horrendous, I had absolute brain freeze it was so cold. I kept thinking I can't do this. But I persisted through the session, which went on for about four hours.

'I was due to have more chemo three weeks later, but after week one, my hair began to fall out. I was so disheartened, I didn't have the energy or fight to carry on and see if it would make a difference.'

However Chelsea was more than happy with the results: 'It helped so much knowing that despite the treatment I was keeping my hair.'
