Under-fire West Ham boss Sam Allardyce believes his side are well stocked in the attacking positions, but need defenders to compete in the Premier League this season.

The Hammers have already signed strikers Diafra Sakho and Enner Valencia this summer, and been offered Sassuolo striker Leonardo Pavoletti, but look short defensively.

To address the side's defensive shortcomings, Allardyce claims to be scouring Europe for players who can help shore up a back line that allowed 10-man Tottenham to score a late winner in Saturday's 1-0 defeat.

Suspended: Centre back James Collins (right) is banned, and Allardyce is desperate for more defenders

The former Bolton boss, speaking ahead of his side's clash with Crystal Palace on Saturday, insists bringing in central defenders is the club's priority.

'There's no search for any more strikers from my point of view, the difficulty is at the other end,' he said. 

'We're without James Collins because of suspension and we could be without James Tomkins because of injury.'

'We're looking at players who are able to play in that position [centre back] throughout Europe.'

Allardyce hopes the Hammers will be boosted soon by new signings Diafra Sakho and Enner Valencia acclimatising and reaching full fitness, but for the moment his priority is beating mangerless Crystal Palace on Saturday.

The Hammers manager said: 'You can only look at the way Palace played at Arsenal and say they were thoroughly professional and unlucky not to take anything.'

'I expect them to be difficult to break down and dangerous on the break.' 

Big Sam has been unpopular with some West Ham fans for a long time due to his perceived negative tactics, and another defeat on Saturday could push him closer to the exit door.
