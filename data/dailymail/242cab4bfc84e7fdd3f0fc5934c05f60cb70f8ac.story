Ed Miliband’s Budget response flopped yesterday because he  had based it on misleading  predictions on Twitter, according to Ed Balls.

The Shadow Chancellor said Labour’s leader had to tear up large sections of his speech when rumours of what George Osborne would announce in Parliament proved false.

He said Mr Miliband hastily inserted jibes about Education Secretary Michael Gove’s attack on Etonian influence in Downing Street.

Mr Miliband was widely criticised for spending 16 minutes reading out political attack lines while barely mentioning the content of the Budget. Mr Balls was similarly derided for his response to the Autumn Statement in December.

Yesterday he appeared to be revelling in his leader’s misfortune in an astonishing post-Budget briefing for journalists.

While a stony-faced Miliband aide looked on, he said: ‘Ed Miliband had written pages of his speech which weren’t used in the end, which he thought might be in there that weren’t, but he had to fill the space by going on and on about Michael Gove’s comments.’

The Shadow Chancellor said Mr Miliband and he had read an ‘excellent tweet’ by one journalist that suggested Mr Osborne would ‘link welfare cuts to the personal allowance’.

And he said BBC economics editor Robert Peston had ‘made people think something might have been going to happen on [taxes for those on] lower and middle incomes’.

Twisting the knife, Mr Balls also took to the television studios to say: ‘It was a difficult speech for Ed Miliband.’

Rather than analysing the announcements about changes to pension annuities and ISAs, the Shadow Chancellor revealed instead that he spent a long section of the speech urging Vince Cable to dig Communities Secretary Eric Pickles in the ribs.

Mr Balls said: ‘Eric Pickles fell asleep for a quite extended period of time and Ed and I were worried because there might have been some big cut in local government spending coming which he didn’t know about.

‘We just politely suggested to Vince Cable that he should wake him up.

‘Vince elbowed and elbowed but it didn’t seem to make any difference.’

Mr Balls claimed that after the third nudge from Mr Cable ‘Eric started to nod knowingly at the contents of the speech while still with his eyes closed’.

He then claimed Mr Cable gave Mr Pickles a sharp jab which woke him when David Cameron ‘stared daggers’ at him.

A crackdown on tax dodging will raise billions by forcing the rich to pay their bills upfront, George Osborne said.

At present, those who sign up to tax avoidance schemes pay what they think they can get away with, and then it is up to HMRC to claw the full amount back through the courts – which can take years.

The Chancellor said that in future the wealthy will have to pay the full rate of tax back as soon as their avoidance scheme is deemed by HMRC to be unlawful. They will then have to go to court to argue their case to have some of it returned.

Mr Osborne said the move, backed by greater powers and a bigger budget for the HMRC, would raise some £4billion over four years.

Mr Pickles claimed last night he was ‘wide awake’ and joked that sleep ‘would have been a blessed release from Labour’s lacklustre response’.

Health Secretary Jeremy Hunt was also pictured resting his eyes.

Mr Balls’s comments on Mr Miliband’s performance is likely to spark further tensions between the Shadow Chancellor and some Miliband aides, who are said to regard him as a ‘nightmare’.

One senior Labour source complained that Mr Miliband had not been given an early sight of the Chancellor’s speech.

‘We’re not very happy about that,’ the source said. ‘You normally get an hour’s notice.’

But an aide to Mr Osborne insisted that Labour had not had an advance copy of the speech in this Parliament. Former Labour adviser Dan Hodges described Mr Miliband’s speech as ‘one of the most wretched I’ve ever seen from a party leader’.

‘It was the Budget that proved conclusively Ed Miliband is not yet ready to be prime minister of this country,’ he wrote.

‘He talked about everything but the Budget that had just been unveiled in front of him. Any leader of the opposition has an obligation to do better than this.’

Wealthy individuals who try to dodge tax by buying property through companies will be hit by punitive rates of stamp duty, George Osborne said yesterday.

The Chancellor announced a major clampdown on the use of so-called  ‘corporate envelopes’ to purchase  residential property – a device popular with wealthy foreign buyers acquiring property in London.

The move follows a stampede to buy up valuable real estate, especially in central London, by Russian oligarchs, Middle  Eastern businessmen and other investors who see the capital as a safe haven for their money.

Corporate buyers already face a 15 per cent stamp duty charge on residential property worth more than £2million.

In future they will be forced to pay the punitive rate on all homes worth more than £500,000.

Forecasts said the change would bring in £365million for the Exchequer by 2018/19.

Mr Osborne made clear that the change will not affect homes that are rented out, in a bid to leave the commercial property market untouched.

Owners of companies which own homes worth more than £2million also currently pay an annual charge of £15,000.

A similar charge will now be phased in on homes worth more than £500,000.
