Thanks to well-endowed stars such as Beyonce and Rihanna, curvaceous derrieres have never been more popular.

But as mother-of-two Apryl Brown knows only too well, attempting to get the look using silicone filler can have catastrophic results.

Instead of a curvier behind, Mrs Brown was left in agony and eventually had to have her buttocks, legs and arms amputated after a black market practitioner injected her with industrial grade silicone of the sort commonly used in bathroom sealant.

Survivor: The botched operation left Apryl in agony and meant her hands and feet had to be amputated

Now the 46-year-old is speaking out in a bid to encourage others to steer clear of rogue practitioners and become more accepting of their bodies.Â 

Her problems began in 2005 when a woman claiming she could provide buttock injections walked into her salon.

Instead of telling her to leave, Apryl, who says she always wanted bigger buttocks, was thrilled and immediately agreed to have the treatment.

At first, everything seemed fine but just months after having the injections, the pain began.

'They [Apryl's buttocks] started to get hard, and then they started to get 
discoloured,' she explains. 'By 2006, it was starting to itch and by 2007, the pain 
started.

'One thing about pain is that you can't turn it off. I couldn't 
sleep, I couldn't eat, I couldn't even concentrate.'

Upsetting: Apryl says she hopes others will learn from her harrowing experience of cowboy surgery

But things continued to get worse. ''I
 had gone to this party one Saturday night and woke up Sunday morning 
and thought "oh my God, Apryl!". I just couldn't pull myself together,' she remembers.

'That night was the roughest night of my life. I literally scratched all 
of the skin off my buttocks. My nails pulled all of the skin off my 
body. And when my sister came in, and she saw that, it freaked her out.'

Apryl was rushed to hospital, where surgeons discovered that a massive infection caused by the impure silicone had caused her body to go into severe shock.

'The only end point on silicone 
injections is removal,' explains the doctor who saved Apryl's life, James Jens Black.

'Removal when it's not infected or removal when it
 is infected and about to kill you.'

After a month in a coma, Apryl awoke to a very different world. The drugs that saved Apryl's life had diverted blood flow to her essential organs, keeping her heart beating and liver functioning as her body fought off the infection.

But her hands and feet, starved of oxygen while the drugs did their work, had died. 'I just moved the cover and I saw my right foot and I thought "oh my God" and it was that moment, that's when it got real,' remembers Apryl.

Gruesome: The damage to Apryl's backside following the botched jab. Her buttocks were later amputated

Dangerous: Silicone injections nearly always have terrible side effects, say leading surgeons

'They were just black and swollen and necrotic and there was gangrene, and one [of Apryl's family members] said: "just look at your hands" and I looked and that's when it got really real.

Along with her buttocks, too damaged and infected from the injections to remain, her hands and feet had to be amputated.

Despite the heavy price she paid for cheap surgery, Apryl says that she's recovering and is determined to enjoy the rest of her life.

'Now it's just my new normal,' she explains. 'Now it's 
just different. Now I don't just wake up and jump up on my legs, I wake 
up and snap on my prosthetics.

'The hands, that's more challenging 
because you don't really realise how much you do with them until you 
don't have them.'

Leading surgeon, Dr Massimiliano Marcellino of the London Centre for Aesthetic Surgery, commented: 'We strongly discourage our patients from undergoing buttock injections.

'You will not find any professional Harley Street cosmetic surgeon that would be prepared to perform this procedure.'

She also hopes others will learn from her story and offers this advice to those contemplating surgery: 'Don't ever 
do anything without researching it and definitely don't ever do anything
 on the black market.

'It's not about how you fall down. It's not about 
making choices that are not catastrophic. It's about knowing how to get 
up.

'And the only thing that will ever make you feel better about 
yourself is feeling loved. That you are enough, no matter how it looks, 
what it is or how it feels, that it's enough.'
