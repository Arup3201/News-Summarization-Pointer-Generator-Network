Natascha Kampusch vanished on her way to school when she was ten and was held captive for eight years

A top policeman assigned to probe the murky Natascha Kampusch kidnapping case in Austria - who was ruled to have killed himself because of personal problems - did not commit suicide, it was revealed in Vienna.

The findings on Oberst Franz Kroell, 59, once again cast doubt on the theory that the Kampusch kidnapper Wolfgang Priklopil acted alone.

Miss Kampusch vanished on her way to school in Vienna in 1998 when she was ten.

Wolfgang Priklopil carved a secret, sound-proof cellar beneath his home in a suburb of the city in which to keep her captive for eight years.

Long considered the victim of a paedophile who had murdered her, Miss Kampusch finally escaped in August 2006.

Kroell was a career officer who never worked on the original investigation but was dragged into the toxic soup of allegation and counter-allegation following the setting-up of the Adamovich Commission - a body tasked to see if others were involved in her vanishing in 1998. 

Six months after the probe ended, in June 2010, he was found shot dead in on the terrace of his home in Graz.

His service pistol was found near his body with a bullet missing from the chamber and police ruled a suicide. 

But his brother Karl never believed it and hired forensic expert Peter Leinzinger to investigate the case.

Karl
 Kroell always maintained his brother was murdered because he carried on
 investigating the case and was convinced there had been a high level 
establishment cover up to protect the identity of Prikloil's accomplice.

Leinzinget's report shows clearly how poorly the original investigation into his death was carried out.

A
 bullet hole in Kroell's wall which is supposed to have been from the 
gun he used to kill himself turned out to have been a hole made from a 
screw where a washing line had been fitted.

Police claimed that the bullet had probably passed through the wall - but there was no exit hole.

In addition there were traces of gunpowder from the shot on both of the
 dead man's hands – as if he had been trying to hold the gun in what 
would have been a typical defensive move.

If
 he had simply shot himself with his right hand this would have meant 
the traces from the shot would have been only on one hand. In fact there
 were more traces on his left hand than his shooting hand.

Prior
 to that there were many other indications that the death was not 
suicide, including the fact that his brother insists that the 
handwriting on the farewell note was not his brother's.

A
 handwriting expert that examined the dead man's signature on his police
 expenses claims confirmed that the was no way the two handwriting 
styles had been written by the same person.

Before his death he had pleaded for the Kampusch case to be reopened - without success.

The case was closed according to the official announcement on 8 January 2010.

But privately he continued to work on it, including a number of interviews that he carried out which he had been forbidden to do as a police officer.

One of the key areas Kroell looked at was that the suicide of Wolfgang Priklopil in the hours after she escaped from his lair outside Vienna in August 2006 after over eight years in captivity. 

Found dead under the wheels of a train, he always believed he was pushed to his death.
