The girlfriend of a school prefect who disappeared weeks after becoming a father broke down in tears yesterday as she showed off their baby in an attempt to persuade him to come home.

Anthony Stubbs vanished in November, shortly after his 18-year old girlfriend Charlotte Mason gave birth to their daughter Lily.

He told her he was going to his  mother’s home a ten-minute walk away but his family have not seen or heard from him since and his bank account remains untouched.

Missing: Anthony Stubbs with baby Lily on the day she was born but he has now been missing for more than a month

Anthony, 16, had moved in with Miss Mason and Lily, despite concern from his family that it could affect his schooling.

It is believed that the Year 11 pupil 
had been struggling with the pressures of fatherhood and vanished after 
having a row with his girlfriend.

Yesterday Miss Mason, who had been 
dating Anthony for almost two years, wept as she appeared with their 
baby daughter at a police press conference.

She cuddled four-month-old Lily in her arms as she pleaded for her teenage boyfriend to return home.

Distraught: Charlotte Mason says she is struggling to cope with what has happened and hopes their beautiful child Lily will persuade him to return

Life: Despite concerns from his family about his schooling, Anthony set up home with Charlotte and Lily at a house in Leyland, Lancashire

‘It’s completely out of character for 
Anthony to go missing,’ she said. ‘We just want to know that he is safe,
it is the not knowing which is so upsetting.

‘We’ve been together for nearly two 
years now and this was Lily’s first Christmas which I know Anthony was 
really looking forward to. He had even bought her a stocking before she 
was born.

‘Anthony was so proud when Lily 
arrived, he is a great dad and I just want him to come home and give her
a cuddle; Lily’s missing her daddy.

‘Anthony we just want to know you are safe, please just get in touch and let us know you’re OK.’

Anthony, from Leyland in Lancashire, 
found out he was going to be a father when he was 15 and had just 
celebrated his 16th birthday when Lily was born in September.

His mother, Denise Machin, 34, said: 
‘I have still got all his presents under the tree from family and 
friends. I honestly thought that he would be back Christmas Eve because 
he loves Christmas.

‘I just don’t know why he has done 
this. It’s been very hard because me and Anthony were always close. He 
could come and tell me anything.

‘This is out of character to walk out and not tell me or his family anything. It is very, very strange.

‘I just want him to come home. If he 
is not ready, just ring to say he is fine. It’s the not knowing. I don’t
know where he’s gone. I just want someone to tell me my son is safe.’

The teenager was last seen as he 
walked with his school bag over his shoulder near to the Seven Stars pub
in Leyland on Sunday, November 25, at 12.55pm.

The day before he went missing, he failed to attend a family gathering where his grandparents were renewing their wedding vows.

Disappearance: Anthony has not been seen for more than a month in a situation that has left Charlotte and the rest of the family huge upset

Anthony, who enjoys music and outdoor pursuits, was studying for his GCSEs at Wellfield Business and Enterprise College.

He is described as being of slim 
build, clean-shaven, with blue eyes and around 5ft 9in tall. His natural
hair colour is mousey brown, but he dyes it black.

Detective Inspector John Entwisle, of 
Lancashire Police, said: ‘We are chasing down every lead and sighting 
but there has been nothing positive so far. People have come forward but
not as much as we would like. We are working through all Anthony’s 
contacts and we would encourage anybody with information about his 
whereabouts to let us know.

‘I would also like to make a direct 
appeal to Anthony:  You’re not in any trouble, we just want you to make 
contact with us or your family so that we know you are safe.’
