When it comes to painting, artists around the globe are constantly looking for the next hit - and this one found it in his morning cuppa.

These masterpieces are created using different blends of tea and coffee, painting life-like portraits set in cafe environments.

Gerard Tonti, 38, began working with coffee and teas six years ago after taking inspiration from fabric dying using the hot drinks in Asian cultures.

Mr Tonti's work is all inspired from the coffee house, as he believes both the scene and the colours coffee and tea create on a canvas work well together.

Each piece takes several painstaking months to complete, as Gerard has to order in flavoured teas from around the world.

By blending different coloured teas and coffee he is able to get the required colours and shades.

Gerard, from Pennsylvania, USA, said: ‘I find coffee houses fascinating places - you have people gathered together in their own circles, all there for different reasons.

‘It was only natural that with the medium I was experimenting with I would find myself merging the two into one. I wanted to capture those moments in time at coffee houses where people get together.

‘There are three problems when painting in this medium that were figured out through trial and error; it's been very much an alchemical process.

‘The first problem is getting tea coffee stains to behave like paint. The second is keeping the vibrant colours of the teas from fading when exposed to sunlight - a problem eventually solved by mixing a UV stabilizer into the actual stain once it has been bound.

‘And finally it's difficult to keep the colour from fading when it is exposed to oxygen. A polyacrylic is used after the painting is completed to seal it and protect it from oxidizing.

‘All of the colours, no matter which I was using, would turn into a brown when exposed to sunlight or oxygen.

'The paintings were very monochromatic and all started to look the same before the issues were solved.

‘The hardest part is that all of the teas and coffees behave differently: teas do not mix very well together so a layered approach works best, so I use a variety of tools to get the result that I'm after.

‘Everything from Q-tips, sponges, spoons, brushes and rags are used. I paint fairly large because the medium is very hard to control in smaller spaces.’
