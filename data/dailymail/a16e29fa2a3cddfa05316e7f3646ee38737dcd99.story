The mother of a Welshman who remains stranded on a stricken yacht in the Pacific Ocean said authorities have not been able to rescue him and his Kiwi partner because of bad weather.

Elizabeth Jones said her son Stephen, 52, and his 43-year-old partner Tanya Davies are battling nearly 50mph (75kph) winds and 30ft waves on the yacht, now listing around 435 miles south west of Tonga.

Mr Jones, originally from Llandudno Junction in Conwy, Wales, and Ms Davies left the island two days ago.

Battle: Stephen Jones, 52, and his 43-year-old partner Tanya Davies are still on board their stricken yacht after it capsized in a storm around 435 miles south-west of Tonga

Concerns: Mrs Jones from Llandudno Junction in Conwy, Wales, said she had originally feared her son's yacht 'Windigo' would sink after it turned over in the storm

They activated an emergency beacon on Wednesday evening and are now floating 783 miles north east of New Zealand, according to rescue workers.

Mrs Jones told the BBC she had originally feared her son's yacht 'Windigo' would sink after it turned over in the storm.

But it has now managed to right itself and the pair are still on board.

She added the couple had suffered head injuries and that Mr Jones had hurt his back when the boat rolled over.

A New Zealand Air Force P3-Orion plane was able to successfully drop the pair a life raft earlier today and establish communications.

Authorities say the pair have secured themselves to the yacht's stern and will stay there until forced to move to the raft.

Boats
are on their way to the scene, but authorities say a rescue operation 
will not take place until Friday morning at the earliest, due to the 
continuing bad weather.

Mrs Jones said: 'The storm is 75kph an hour with the wind, and the waves are 10m high so they're in the middle of that.

'They (authorities) didn't find them until last night but they can't go near them because of the weather.

'They've been in distress for nearly two days now.'

Mr Jones is an experienced yachtsman who has been sailing for more than 25 years.

Luxury: Mr Jones is an experienced yachtsman who has been sailing for more than 25 years. He has been living on board the 38ft yacht for around two-and-a-half-years

He has been living on board the yacht for around two-and-a-half-years and in Australia for years before that.

He and Ms Davies were travelling from Tonga to New Zealand when the storm hit.

Search and Rescue Mission Coordinator Keith Allen told the BBC that the swell was dying down but conditions remained rough.

He
said: 'It will be extremely uncomfortable and the people aboard are 
tired, but the yacht is still afloat so the correct approach is to 
remain on board.'
