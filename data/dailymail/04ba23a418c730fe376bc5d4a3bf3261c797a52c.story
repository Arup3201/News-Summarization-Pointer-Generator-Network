Celebrity chef Heston Blumenthal has dropped his supplier of foie gras after embarrassing footage of ducks being force-fed was released on the internet. 

The owner of the Michelin-starred Fat Duck restaurant in Bray, Berkshire dropped his French foie gras supplier due to animal rights concerns. 

A spokesman for the Fat Duck said: 'We were shocked at the video and the conditions in which the ducks were apparently being kept.' The restaurant said the farm had shown the highest levels of animal husbandry when they inspected it.

Foie gras is produced by force-feeding ducks or geese so their tasty livers expand by ten times the size

The Daily Mirror  released footage of injured ducks in the Maison Miteault farm being force-fed. At least one of the ducks in the video appears to have died. 

Farm owner Louis-Marie Mitteault said he was unsure whether the footage was shot in his farm claiming that people were welcome to inspect his facility at any time. 

Each year approximately 38 million ducks and geese are killed in France to make foie gras. 

The birds are routinely force-fed before being hung upside down and having their throats slit. 

Farmers only use male birds and the females are tossed into an electric mincer at one day old.

Meanwhile, Blumenthal's Michelin star restaurant, The Fat Duck is moving to Melbourne for six months in the new year. 

The restaurant is heading south while the building is being refurbished. 

Billed by the restaurateur as 'the furthest migration of a duck', Blumenthal said his award-winning venue would move to Australia next year, opening in Melbourne in February.

He said The Fat Duck would temporarily close its UK premises, in Bray, Berkshire - with staff and some of the furniture at the three-Michelin-starred restaurant moving around the world for six months.

Speaking at a press conference, Blumenthal said: 'I'm going to shut The Fat Duck and bring it here to Melbourne.

'This is probably the furthest migration a duck - of any kind, let along a big fat duck - has made.'

Blumenthal said the Australian venture would close after six months and he would return to the UK, with a new restaurant - Dinner by Heston Blumenthal.

He said: 'This is not a pop-up restaurant, this is not a guest chef coming over and doing a few weeks or a period of time in somebody else's restaurant.

'We are going to pick up The Fat Duck, the whole team, and fly them over here.

'We're even going to pick up some of the bits of the restaurant - maybe the sign, maybe bits of the leather from the chairs - and incorporate it into the dining space in The Fat Duck.

'Then in January we are all going to come over here. The plan is to open here in February.'

Opened to critical acclaim in 2011, the restaurant specialises in historical English food and caters for about 1,000 customers a week.

A meal for two can cost around £190, and signature dishes include the Meat Fruit recipe - a chicken liver mousse made to look like a mandarin orange.

Blumenthal shut The Fat Duck for two weeks in 2009 following an outbreak of the winter bug that left more than 500 people feeling sick.
