This is the bizarre and distinctive prison issue clothing worn by murder suspect John Anslow on the day he escaped from a prison van last month.

Anslow, 31, was wearing the bright blue and yellow pyjama-style clothing when he escaped from a prison van near HMP Hewell Grange near Bromsgrove, Worcestershire, on January 23.

The murder suspect was sprung from the van during an ambush by masked raiders who smashed the prison van's windscreen with sledgehammers before speeding away in a silver VW vehicle.

As part of the hunt for the prisoner, detectives have released the image of the distinctive outfit worn by Anslow in the hope more witnesses will come forward.

It is thought the prisoner might have discarded the bright prison suit on or since his escape.

Anslow, who had been en route to Stafford Crown Court when he escaped the prison van on January 23, is classed as a 'Category A' prisoner.

This is reserved for those prisoners whose escape would be highly dangerous to the public, police or security, and for whom the aim is to make escape impossible.

Police also revealed more information today about the vehicles used in his escape and the route they took.

A grey Mercedes C63 AMG Estate was a second car used by the offenders.

A silver VW Scirocco, registration BT59 NXC, was used before they abandoned it and switched to the Mercedes.

Police said the Mercedes travelled north along the B4096 Hewell Lane on to Alcester Road to the M42 Junction 1 island.

It then went on to the B4096, on the Old Birmingham Road towards the Lickey Hills, travelled down Rose Hill and turned left into Lickey Road in Cofton Hackett.

A £10,000 reward has been offered for information about Anslow, from Tipton, that leads to his arrest and return to prison.

Anslow was one of five men charged with the murder of businessman Richard Deakin in Chasetown, Staffordshire, in July 2010.

Searches have been carried out by police in the Tipton area following Anslow’s escape but he remains at large.

A 44-year-old man arrested on suspicion of assisting an offender following the escape remains on police bail.

Police have said they consider Anslow to be very dangerous and have warned anyone who sees him to not approach him and to contact them immediately.

Detective Superintendent Wayne Jones, from Staffordshire Police, said: 'We’re determined to catch Anslow and a dedicated team of detectives are following several lines of inquiry.

'A substantial reward of £10,000 remains on offer for anyone who can give us information that leads to Anslow’s arrest and return to prison.

'We’ve had over 100 calls from across the country so far and are continuing to liaise with other forces and agencies nationwide. Our officers are working closely with colleagues at West Mercia and West Midlands police forces.

'We’re particularly keen to speak to anyone who saw the Mercedes on Monday January 23 or any suspicious activity in the areas surrounding the prison during the weekend before.

'We also need to talk to people who may have seen Anslow in the distinctive prison suit - or the discarded suit itself after the incident.'

Anyone with information is asked to contact police on 01785 232503 or Crimestoppers, anonymously, on 0800 555 111.
