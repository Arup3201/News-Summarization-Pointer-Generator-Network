Fresh case: A man from Gloucestershire was arrested by police after allegedly naming the girl who has accused Michael Le Vell of years of sexual abuse

Police have made an arrest after the girl allegedly raped by Coronation Street actor Michael Le Vell as she clutched her favourite teddy bear was named online.

A 43-year-old man from Gloucestershire was held last night after he apparently tweeted the girl's identity.

Le Vell, who is being tried under his real name Michael Turner, is currently facing 12 alleged sex offences, including rape, at Manchester 
Crown Court.

Under law, alleged victims of all sexual offences are afforded anonymity for life.

Greater Manchester Police said this morning they had made an arrest near Gloucester on suspicion of breaching
the Sexual Offences Act 1992 after the suspect allegedly revealed the girl's identity to his followers.

He was questioned by detectives before being bailed.

A 23-year-old man was given a police caution after he was arrested in March for tweeting the girl's identity.

Superintendent Phil Davies from Greater Manchester Police, said: 'Public identification of victims of sex abuse, in particular child victims engaged in court proceedings, can cause both immediate and long term distress and harm, especially in cases as serious as this.

'The same principles apply to social media as they do to the mainstream media, and we are investigating this matter robustly.

'People may not understand that when they use social media they are required by the law to keep victims anonymous in exactly the same way as people who work in main stream media. The rule of law and consciousness of a sex abuse victim's anonymity should be considered by all who follow these types of cases.'

Le Vell is one of Britain's most famous and best-loved soap stars, having played mechanic Kevin Webster in Coronation Street for 30 years.

Earlier the jury at Manchester Crown Court was told Le Vell had repeatedly raped and sexually abused the girl from the age of six.

On one occasion he allegedly held her favourite teddy bear over her mouth to ensure she remained silent while he raped her.

The court was told the girl first 
said she had been raped after attending a motivational conference in 
London hosted by a womanÂ  who had herself been raped as a young child.

The teenager had travelled to the 
self-help conference with her mother and the pair had attended workshops
and seminars separately.

But during a scheduled break in the day the girl broke the news to her mother and told her it had been going on for years.

Yesterday a medical expert sais the girl showed no signs of injury during physical examination, a medical expert said yesterday.

Le Vell was in arrested in 2011 but 
the case was dropped only for him to be rearrested and charged in the 
light of fresh evidence last year.

He has been suspended from Coronation Street until the conclusion of the trial, which continues.

Long-running character: The actor, who has been on the soap for 30 years, is reportedly set to return, depending on the outcome of the trial
