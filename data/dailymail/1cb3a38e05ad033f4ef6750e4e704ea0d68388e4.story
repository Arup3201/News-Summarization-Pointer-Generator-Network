Times are tough for police forces across the country as budgets are slashed.

But one force are refusing to let the harsh measures stop them fighting crime - and have called on rural horse owners to saddle up and patrol the countryside for them.

A bunch of public-minded volunteers have answered the call, and been given high-visibility jackets with police markings and matching leg straps and coats for their steeds.'

The new 12-strong Rural Mounted Patrol will police the lanes, bridleways and country roads of Hampshire

The new 12-strong Rural Mounted Patrol will police the lanes, bridleways and country roads of Hampshire on the hunt for suspicious activity.

Rural crime ranges from property theft to fly-tipping, metal thefts, deer poaching and sheep rustling.

Volunteer Wendy Thairs is looking forward to taking her two horses on patrol in New Forest, Hants.

She said: 'The thin blue line has been stretched as far as it can go, so the rural community has to stand up and be counted.

'Having suffered from rural crime - but luckily our equipment was found and returned undamaged - it’s now ‘pay back time’.

'Both my horses, Groombridge and Kentucky, are recently retired from the Metropolitan Police Mounted Branch and are still eager to go out on patrol.

The riders, who are subject to security checks, have no more power of arrest than any other citizen

'Groombridge is so big I can see over most people’s hedges and obviously we don’t need four wheel drive to go off road.'

The volunteers will report back to the police control room.

Vanessa Dowling, from Emsworth, Hants, said she’s happy to help keep lookout in areas that are difficult for officers to reach.

She said: 'When our horses are out patrolling the lanes, bridleways and forests, we are able to get to areas that cannot be easily reached by car.

'We are a highly visual presence in the rural landscape and are trained to see and recognise things that might be unusual and out of the ordinary.

'It’s all about helping the rural police on difficult terrains and putting something back into the community where we live and the countryside that we love.'

Hampshire Constabulary have joined forces with Hampshire Horsewatch scheme members in the drive to tackle rural crime across six areas.

Hampshire Horsewatch is a community-led project aimed at preventing thieves who target equine equipment.

David Collings, Hampshire Horsewatch co-ordinator and the force’s equine liaison officer, has high hopes for the patrols, who will put in around eight hours a month.

Mr Collings said: 'With the reduction of funding being experienced within the police service there is a need to be as dynamic and imaginative as we can to cover rural policing in Hampshire.'

The riders, who are subject to security checks, have no more power of arrest than any other citizen.

They and their horses must prove their on and off road work before being given an area to patrol.

They are also expected to keep their tack in good order and make sure their horse is ‘clean and tidy'.

Chief Inspector Simon Dodds, the force’s lead on rural policing, said the mounted patrols were an ‘exciting development’.

Chief Insp Dodds said: 'Having police volunteers on horseback is an exciting development in how rural areas of the force are patrolled.

'Working in partnership with rural neighbourhood teams, the riders will help combat crime in some of our more isolated communities.'
