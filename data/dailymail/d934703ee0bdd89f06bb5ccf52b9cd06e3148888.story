The world’s largest solar boat has docked in London, its final port of call on an epic voyage of scientific discovery along the Gulf stream.

The MS Tûranor PlanetSolar cruised along the Thames yesterday before docking at Canary Wharf where it will stay until tomorrow.

This is the first time the impressive Catamaran has visited the UK, making its grand entrance by floating under an open Tower Bridge yesterday afternoon.

The eco-friendly boat's crew of nine is collecting data on the sea and atmosphere between the United States and Norway as part of an investigation into climate change.

The impressive vessel crossed the Atlantic in a record breaking 22 days earlier this year when it travelled from Las Palmas, Canary Islands to Saint Martin in the Caribbean.

Its 809 solar panels can generate up to 480 kWh on a sunny day.

Launched in Florida, its DeepWater expedition sought to collect a continuous series of
physical and biological measurements along the Gulf Stream, both from 
the water and the atmosphere, using advanced instruments onboard.

It
will remain docked at Canary Wharf, London,until tomorrow, giving 
enthusiasts the opportunity to admire its streamlined design and 
innovative energy technologies.

The PlanetSolar arrived on the River Thames in London yesterday, its final port of call in a voyage of environmental discovery

The eco-friendly boat will be docked at Canary Wharf until September 2. Enthusiasts have the chance to visit the impressive vessel whose solar panels can generate 480 kWh on a sunny day

The vessel is a
scientific research platform for the University of Geneva (UNIGE), has a
top speed of 14 knots and is home to up to nine crew members at a time,
including scientists.

It
is stuffed with atmospheric instruments, some of which are prototypes 
developed by the university.

Led by Professor Martin Beniston, 
climatologist and director of the Institute of Environmental Sciences at
UNIGE, the research team studied the key parameters of climate 
regulation, focusing on aerosols and phytoplankton.

Their aim is to improve the 
understanding of complex interactions between the ocean and atmosphere, 
as well as the role these interactions play in climate change.

The MS Turanor PlanetSolar has 512 square metres of photovoltaic cells and is capable of crossing the Atlantic ocean in just 22 days

It is the first time the impressive catamaran has visited the UK and it will be docked at Canary Wharf from tomorrow until Monday 2nd September to show off its solar panels that can generate 480 kwh on a sunny day. It is pictured in New York

He said: 'The PlanetSolar DeepWater expedition has
allowed intensive testing in real-world conditions of a number of ocean
and atmospheric instruments, some of which are prototypes.

'There is now a wealth of physical, 
chemical, and biological data housed at the University of Geneva, and 
which is beginning to undergo exhaustive scientific scrutiny.

'Although 
the data has not been analysed yet, we have noticed some very 
interesting trends, especially with regards to the production of 
aerosols by sea sprays,' he said.

The boat is approximately 35m long 
and 23m wide, depending on whether the solar panels are closed - when it
is docked or experiencing very rough conditions at sea - or open, in 
most instances at sea.

The boat travels at an average speed of five knots and uses a staggering 512 square metres of photovoltaic panels to power six blocks of lithium-ion batteries.

Despite this it is is light, durable and completely silent.

Here, the boat has 'closed' its solar panels allowing it to dock more easily. It also pulls them in when sea conditions are very rough

Crossing the Atlantic in 22 days, the speedy solar boat compares favourably with a 40 foot sailing ship, which usually takes around 35 days to cross the ocean

The university believes it clearly 
demonstrates the possibilities of solar power for sea travel, with 
massive implications for sustainable tourism and transport.

With zero fuel requirements and zero carbon emissions, the boat can 
take to the open seas for months at a time, so long as the sun continues
to rise.

Professor Beniston said: 'The MS Tûranor PlanetSolar has positive 
benefits for scientific study and exploration, allowing for 
pollution-free research to be carried out in the vicinity of the boat.'

The boat also plays an educational role as the scientists are keen to raise awareness about environmental issues.

One of the aims of the recent expedition, which stopped at Miami, New York, Boston, Halifax and St. John’s before journeying to London, is to promote the use of solar technology.

It was designed by Craig Loomes from New Zealand after months of research into creating the optimum dimensions and design of the double-hulled vessel.

Engineers optimised the energy collection and 
storage as well as the boat’s aerodynamics, propulsion systems and 
choice of building materials.

The light scientific vessel has a carbon structure and is its name is inspired by the literary mythology of J.R.R. Tolkien and literally means 'power of the sun'.

After visiting London, the boat will cross the English Channel and will then dock in Paris.

The boat is stuffed with atmospheric instruments, some of which are prototypes and for the past four months has been analysing the Gulf Stream to collect data that might inform scientists about climate change. It is pictured on a visit to New York
