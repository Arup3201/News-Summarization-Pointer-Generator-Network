They are less likely to be adopted than dogs of other colors.

So, one Utah-based photographer decided to help dark-colored pups in need of a home - by taking striking portraits of them. 

Guinnevere Shuster rounded up eight black dogs at the Humane Society of Utah, including two old Labradors who had had no adoptive interest at all.

She then fixed a flowery crown or necklace to each of the canines, before photographing them against a dark backdrop to 'highlight their eyes'.  

And the result is simply striking. Many of the animals look majestic, like kings of the canine world, while others are gazing at the camera adorably.

Beautiful: Utah-based photographer Guinnevere Shuster decided to help eight dark-colored pups in need of a home - by taking striking portraits of them. Since she e took the photos in January, six of the eight dogs have been adopted Above, four-year-old Sasha (adopted)

Majestic: Ms Shuster rounded up the black dogs at the Humane Society of Utah, in Murray. Above, two-year-old Barkley (not yet adopted)

Adorable: She then fixed a flowery crown or necklace to each of the canines, before photographing them against a dark backdrop to 'highlight their eyes'. Above, six-month-old Rafiki (adopted) gazes at the camera with wide eyes while donning a red-and-yellow crown

Indeed, the images are so moving they have helped six of the dogs find owners since the end of January, including the two 10-year-old Labradors.

Speaking of her pictures, Ms Shuster told The Huffington Post: 'People often comment on how black dogs do not photograph well, so I really wanted to show that they can,' She added: 'I would have expected two, maybe three, to have been adopted [in the past few weeks] without the photos.'

Ms Shuster said her method for creating the first series of images (she has since photographed more dark-colored dogs) was 'really easy and cheap'.

First, she spent $22 on faux flowers. Then, she hot-glued them into paper crowns and necklaces that she had bought at a Dollar Store, she said. 

'Oh, I did raid one dried flower arrangement for the two lotus flowers and dried wheat grass,' Ms Shuster added.

Finally, the photographer placed the crowns and necklaces on the dogs at the shelter, before snapping photos of them in front of the black backdrop.

Adopted: Speaking of her pictures, Ms Shuster said: 'People often comment on how black dogs do not photograph well, so I really wanted to show that they can.' Above, 10-year-old Ricky, one of the two black Labradors that were adopted in the wake of the photo series

Cute: She added: 'I would have expected two, maybe three, to have been adopted [in the past few weeks] without the photos.' Above, one-year-old Homie (adopted) twists his head to the right as he looks toward the camera, while wearing a purple-and-yellow crown on his head

Necklace: Ms Shuster spent $22 on faux flowers. Then, she hot-glued them into paper crowns and necklaces that she had bought at a Dollar Store. Above, one-year-old Potato (adopted) sits up straight for his portrait, while sporting a yellow-and-red flowery necklace

Photographer: Ms Shuster's incredible photos were inspired by New York City-based photographer Sophie Gamand, who took similar photos of pit bulls last year in a bid to change perceptions of them. Above, Ms Shuster is pictured  in two separate Facebook photos

Following her images' success, a number of other canine shelters and rescue groups in the area have inquired as to how they can highlight their black dogs' best features in a bid to enhance their chances of being adopted. And Ms Shuster hopes more groups nationwide will strive to do the same.

'When people see this series I hope they see how beautiful black shelter dogs are,' said the photographer. 'Using photography to feature adoptable animals is a passion of mine and I’m always trying to come up with ideas to help those who need it most.'

Black Dog Syndrome is a phenomenon in which dogs with black fur often go unadopted because of misinformed stereotypes. According to various sets of figures, dark-colored pups are euthanized across America at a much higher rate than dogs with different complexions.

Some believe this is because the animals are mischaracterized as mean and potentially violent.

However, others claim the canines' adoption photos do not turn out as cute or appealing as those of lighter-colored dogs.
