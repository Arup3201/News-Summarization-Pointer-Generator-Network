Looking glamorous in a fur-lined coat, Princess Michael of Kent took a break from the slopes to indulge in a spot of culture last week.

The 70-year-old royal was seen enjoying an evening in a gallery with some fellow art enthusiasts at the Galerie Gmurzynska in St Moritz, Switzerland.

It came in the same week Princess Michael - dubbed Princess Pushy for her firm demeanour - took to the slopes for a spot of skiing with friends.

A spokesperson for Galerie Gmurzynska, which was established in 1963 in Cologne and is touted as one of the leading galleries for Russian Avant-Garde and Classical Modern art, told MailOnline that the royal took in Tom Wesselmann's A Line to Greatness exhibition.

Wesselmann is well-known for his signature steel drawings, which he sketched between the 1980s and 1990s. 

According to her website, Princess Michael is a staunch art fan. It reads: 'Princess Michael has joined Galerie Gmurzynska in Zurich and St Moritz.

'The gallery is co-owned by Mathias Rastorfer and Krystyna Gmurzynska with Krystyna’s son and daughter also working with them.

'Gmurzynska is one of the world’s leading galleries specializing in Contemporary, Modern, Early Modern, Russian Avant-Garde and Impressionist paintings and sculpture. 

'The gallery has represented the estate of Yves Klein for the past 20 years; has a current Zaha Hadid exhibition; contains works by Bacon, Rothko, and Indiana as well as classics such as Matisse and Picasso.'

Off she goes! The royal was one of the last guests to leave the gallery 

Prince Michael of Kent is the Queen's first cousin and married his Austrian aristocrat wife, Marie Christine Anna Agnes Hedwig Ida von Reibnitz, in 1978

On the Friday, the royal was seen hitting the slopes.

Dressed in a full navy ski suit, she showed off her athletic prowess with friends and stopped for a break at a cafe on her way down the mountain.

The couple wed just a month after Princess Michael annulled her first marriage and now occupy an unusual place in the Royal family.

Because Prince Michael was the third-born child of George V's son the Duke of Kent, after siblings Prince Edward and Princess Alexandra, he and his wife do not receive a public allowance.

A qualified Russian interpreter, he earns his money from a private consultancy firm offering international advice in construction, telecommunications, insurance, finance and tourism.

But he and his wife have lived since 1978 in a five-bedroom apartment in Kensington Palace in the heart of London, where until 2010 the £120,000-a-year rent was paid for by the Queen.

The revelation sparked calls to evict the couple - but Buckingham Palace defended the set-up in 2005, saying it was to recognise engagements they undertook at their own expense.

Just five years later, however, Prince and Princess Michael began paying the full cost of the apartment themselves. 

Princess Michael's title with her husband's name is in fact completely normal for the Royal family - but she happens to be the only living member who is addressed in that way.

It is because she is not a Princess in her own right and because, as Buckingham Palace puts it, 'Prince Michael is the only grandson of a king titled HRH who is a second son'.

Earlier this month, Prince and Princess Michael of Kent were revealed to be among the royals, politicians, film actors and sports stars named as holding secretive Swiss accounts in banking's biggest-ever leak.

The Queen's cousin and his wife, often known as Princess Pushy, were among a number of high profile names revealed by a whistleblower to have held accounts with HSBC's private Swiss banking arm.  

The account linked to the royal couple was reportedly held in the name of their company, Cantium Services Limited. 

A representative for the couple told the International Consortium for Investigative Journalists that the account had 'never received nor held any funds' and was closed in 2009. 

MailOnline has contacted a spokesman for Prince and Princess Michael for further comment.
