Stolen: The Sheep Trophy from 1916 was among 33 accolades and shields stolen from the glass cabinets

Thieves took just three minutes to steal trophies worth thousands of pounds from the Goodwood estate in West Sussex.

At least four raiders broke in through a ground floor window of the Kennels Clubhouse before smashing glass cabinets and stealing 33 trophies and shields worth Â£15,000, staff said.

They then drove off in a dark Range Rover, according to CCTV footage.

Two of the stolen trophies were part 
of the Goodwood chattels and were historically valuable to the estate, 
which is the seat of the Dukes of Richmond and home to the Earl and 
Countess of March.

The 
stolen 1931 Mobil Oil Trophy, given for motor racing, stands 16.5 inches
high and features a shallow silver bowl supported by winged women, 
while the 'irreplaceable' 1916 Chichester Show Sheep cup was also taken.

Spokesman
Gary Wood told the Daily Telegraph: 'These trophies would be very hard 
to sell on and we fear they could be melted down and sold for scrap.'

The 12,000-acre estate, near Chichester,
is home to some of the biggest events in racing, including the Festival
of Speed and horse racing's Glorious Goodwood.

Goodwood is offering a reward for the 
return of the trophies, which were stolen at about 11pm on Monday March 
11. Sussex Police has appealed for anyone with information to come 
forward.
