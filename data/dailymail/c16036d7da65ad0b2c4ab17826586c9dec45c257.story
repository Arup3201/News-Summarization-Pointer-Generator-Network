Bloggers who want to grow their online popularity can now purchase followers - at the risk of potentially ruining their credibility.

Services like Buzzoid, Hypez and Buy Instagram Followers charge as little as $3 per every 100 new followers, a tempting way for social media users to get a jump start and set themselves apart from competitors.

But some say that purchasing a following is equivalent to cheating in the social media world. 'There's respect that comes... with letting your blog get big on its own, the organic way,' LA-based blogger Dale Janee told Racked.com.

'If people would ever find out, you would lose all credibility and that is not worth it,' she added. 

Fashion blogger Jessica Quirk, who runs What I Wore, and Song of Style's Aimee Song are just some of the popular Instagram users of late who have been accused of buying followers to grow their presence.

Even political figures are jumping on the bandwagon; just last week Vancouver Mayor Gregor Robertson and his party, Vision Vancouver, experienced a sudden spike in Twitter followers - a red flag to savvy internet users who suspected him of buying followers.

In the end, a spokesperson for the Mayor claimed that the increase of more than 40,000 followers within just a few days was due to a spam attack - not a bid to make the Mayor appear more popular.

Still, people often point to such sudden increases in likes, follows and comments as proof that a blogger's following is not 100per cent genuine. 

'It's kind of depressing,' lifestyle blogger Siel Devos said of the growing trend. 'You think these bloggers are famous because they work for it until you realize that it's all bought.'

Even more depressing, however, is that it tends to work; Instagram accounts gain more exposure when they have more followers, so buying followers inevitably leads to more actual followers.

Indeed, a marketing associate from Buy Instagram Followers - where 1,000 active Instagram followers costs just $90 - explained that most of their clients come back for more on a regular basis.

'The more active followers you have, the more exposure you are going to get,' said the employee. 

But a blogger who buys followers can do significant damage when they are associated with big name brands.

'Those fake numbers are used by bloggers to make real money they don't deserve - income that's based on what amounts to falsified data,' Alice Wright, who founded blogger forum GOMI, explains. 

Ethical grey area: 'If that sort of practice came to light in the real world, people would probably be getting sued, but since it's blogland, they seem to get away with anything,' said GOMI founder Alice Right

Since companies pay bloggers based on how much influence they appear to have, a lot of money can be lost if some of the bloggers' followers don't actually exist

'If that sort of practice came to light in the real world, people would probably be getting sued, but since it's blogland, they seem to get away with anything,' she said.

However, companies have begun to combat these fake followeings with algorithms that show a blogger's actual influence - disregarding their number of followers.

Outrigger Media, for instance, ranks the top beauty bloggers on YouTube according to their consistency, influence and momentum.
