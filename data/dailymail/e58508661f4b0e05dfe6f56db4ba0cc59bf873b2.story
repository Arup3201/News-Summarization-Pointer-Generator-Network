The gap between the numbers of rich and poor pupils going to university 'remains large' a damning report has warned.

New figures suggest that a teenager's chances of going to university still depend heavily on where they live, their background and their gender.

Aspiring pupils from disadvantaged backgrounds would need to treble their enrollment figures to match those from wealthier areas, the Higher Education Funding Council for England (HEFCE) reported.

And the financial pressures of university fees are effectively freezing out potential British postgraduates, which has led to their foreign peers outnumbering them in UK higher education institutions, another study showed.

In areas of the country where few students go into higher education, women were over a third (35 per cent) more likely to go than their male peers.

In the late 1990s, teenagers living in areas of England where high numbers of students went into higher education were four times more likely to study for a degree than those living in areas where few people chose to continue their education.

By 2011/12 this had narrowed with those living in 'high-participation' areas three times more likely to go to university than those in areas of 'low-participation'.

But the report adds: 'Young people in the most disadvantaged areas would need to treble their participation rate in order to match the rate of those from the most advantaged areas.'

Professor Les Ebdon, director of fair access to higher education, said he was pleased to see 'sustained progress' in the numbers of disadvantaged students going to university.

But he added: 'Young people from the most advantaged neighbourhoods in England are still three times more likely to go to higher education than the most disadvantaged young people.

'Meanwhile, there has been a 40 per cent decline in part-time study over recent years, which is worrying because part-time students are more likely to come from groups that are currently under-represented in higher education.

'Addressing these complex issues requires universities, colleges and schools to work together, engaging across the learner's whole lifecycle.

'This means encouraging children from an early age to think about higher education as an option, supporting teenagers as they make key decisions, and working with employers to reach out to potential mature students. It's also vital that policy is joined up across all education sectors.'

Despite the gaps, a rising numbers of 
young people are choosing to go to university, with women more likely to
study for a degree than men, the HEFCE figures show.

More
than a third (38 per cent) of those who were 18 in 2011/12 went into 
higher education, up from three in 10 (30 per cent) of those who were 
the same age in 1998/99, according to data published by the HEFCE.

The
data looks at the proportion of school leavers going on to university, 
taking into account their sex, background and home town, from the late 
1990s up until 2011/12.

The 
findings show a 26 per cent increase over this period in the proportion 
of 18-year-olds continuing their education beyond A-levels and 
equivalent qualifications, with most of the rise happening from the 
mid-2000s onwards.

HEFCE's 
report says that by 2011/12, women were, on average, over a fifth (22 
per cent) more likely to attend university by age 19 than men.

The gap is most distinct in the capital, with 18-year-olds in London the most likely group to go to university, with the rift between the proportions of teenagers in the city and those in the rest of the country widening, the study shows.

By 2011/12 youngsters in London were over a third (36 per cent) more likely to go into higher education than those who were the same age in the late 1990s, and were around 43 per cent more likely to go than young people living in the North East, the region where teenagers are the least likely to continue their education beyond A-levels.

The findings show that the areas where youngsters are the least likely to go to university tend to be along the coast, in rural parts of the South West, the East Midlands and the East of England as well as in former industrial towns in the Midlands and the North of England.

Meanwhile, foreign students have outnumbered their UK counterparts in postgraduate education at British universities since 2008, a report revealed today.

International student numbers have soared by 90 per cent in the past decade while the number of home-grown students has fallen by 12 per cent in the past three years, a report by the 1994 group of universities said.

There may be a future crisis as there will be a dearth of skilled British professionals, the Independent reported.

Instead, universities could teach the UK's economic rivals skills they would use to compete against Britain.

Figures show poorer British students are becoming increasingly less likely to apply because they do not have financial support.
