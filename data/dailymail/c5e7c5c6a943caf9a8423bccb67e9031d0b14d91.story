A congresswoman who was told that her unborn baby had a fatal condition has spoken of her joy at watching her now thriving baby grow.

'She is doing wonderful, she is doing amazing,' Jamie Herrera Beutler told Today, after her baby was born prematurely and without kidneys.

Tiny Abigail Rose, who was born in July, only 28 weeks into the pregnancy, may be the only child with Potter Sequence to have survived.

Optimistic: Congresswoman Michelle Beutler and husband Daniel say their baby who has Potter Sequence is doing well

'Thriving': Tiny Abigail, who was born weighing just over 2lb, is making good progress

'I don’t think there were any physicians
who expected, based on her prenatal diagnosis, to ever reach that stage
where she’s simply a growing preemie, breathing on her own, but 
requiring dialysis,' Dr Louis Halamek, of Packard 
Children's Hospital, said.

Abigail's proud parents, who have only recently been able to hold her for the first time, are also delighted at her progress.

'She’s playing. She will scream when her diaper is dirty. She is like any
other baby. She has a few challenges, but man, she’s determined,' Mrs Beutler said.

She and her husband Daniel had been expecting to find out whether they were expecting a boy or girl when they were first told their baby had a serious condition at their routine ultrasound.

'It is the worst moment in your life,' the Washington representative said. 'He was telling us "your baby has no options" ... And at that moment, she was 
moving. She was moving in me, and he is telling me she’s not going to 
live.'

Abigail has Potter Sequence, in which impaired kidney function leads
to low amniotic fluid during pregnancy, preventing the lungs from developing properly. She is having dialysis now and will need a kidney transplant later this year.

When her parents were first told there was no hope for their first child, they were faced with an agonizing decision of whether to accept what their doctor told them, or to continue with their pregnancy.

'They gave us no options. It is the worst moment in your life,' Mrs Beutler said.

The couple spoke to several doctors before finding a specialist in Baltimore who agreed to try an experimental treatment that involved injecting saline solution into the womb to replace the crucial amniotic fluid that was missing. 

Though only 2lb 12oz at birth, Abigail 
had fully developed lungs and is breathing on her own, suggesting that 
the relatively uncommon treatment had worked.

They were put in contact with the doctor after another parent slipped them a name and said: 'Here's a doctor who might try.'

Mr Beutler said that like most parents, they were determined to never give up, and has advised families facing a similar situation to find a doctor willing to help.

He added: 'There's no guaranteed solutions and there's no magical cures ... but don't be satisfied with just one opinion because there's a lot of intelligent doctors with different perspectives and experiences.

On a Facebook page announcing the baby's birth, the Beutlers revealed how they refused to give up on their baby.

'Multiple doctors explained that based on medical evidence her condition was incompatible with life and that, if she survived to term, she would be unable to breathe and live only moments after birth,' they wrote.

'We were also told that dialysis or transplant were not possible. The options we were offered were termination or “expectant management,” that is, waiting for her to die. Instead, we chose to pray earnestly for a miracle.'

Dr Halamek, a neonatologist in California, said he was cautiously optimistic about the baby's future.

'Despite Abigail's prematurity, small size and life-threatening disease, she is doing well,' he said.

Mrs Beutler, 34, is a Republican in her second term in Congress, 
representing the 3rd district covering the southwest portion of 
Washington state.

Expectant mother: Rep. Beutler, 34, had announced on May 1 that she was expecting her first child in the fall

Babies with Potter Sequence typically die within a couple days of being born, according to the National Institute of Health.

The
condition's primary problem is when the kidneys, which normally produce
amniotic fluid, fail to develop properly as the baby is growing in the 
womb.

Without amniotic
fluid, the infant is not cushioned from the walls of the uterus, which 
can lead to abnormal facial and limb development. The condition may also stunt the development of the lungs.

The Republican had announced on May 1 that she was expecting her first child in the fall.

The
couple wrote that they didn't know what the future held, 'but we ask 
for your prayers and appreciate the privacy a family needs in such 
circumstances.'

'According 
to the medical information and advice we've received, I will be able to 
continue to balance the responsibilities of an expectant mother with 
serving as your representative in Congress,' the message continued.
