A hero Jack Russell saved her owners' lives by raising the alarm when a Jacuzzi caught fire.

Jonathan Denby says five-year-old Pepper's barking alerted them to a blaze that swept through their home in Grange-over-Sands, Cumbria.

Mr Denby, a hotel owner, said he was very proud of Pepper, who raised the alarm and alerted his wife Margaret to a ‘terrifying’ bathroom blaze.

I'm all right, Jack: Margaret and her two daughters were able to flee after Jack Russell Pepper raised the alarm

Gutted: The fire started in the jacuzzi and rapidly engulfed the bathroom. The family was unaware until Pepper alerted them to the blaze

She suffered smoke inhalation which made her breathless as she dialled 999.

Mr Denby, who was away at the time, said: 'The whole house could have gone. Pepper really did save the day.'

Mrs Denby said she did not smell smoke as she settled down to watch television in her living room for a 'quiet' Friday night with daughters Sara and Georgina.

'I had got myself comfortable and the girls were downstairs in their bedrooms,' she said.

'I did hear a bang, which I now know was some sort of cosmetic or deodorant exploding but at the time I put it down to the weather or fireworks. Pepper obviously heard it though.

'She kept barking and I thought she just wanted to go outside, but she was very agitated and wouldn’t give up - she knew something was wrong.'

Man's best friend: Owner Jonathan says the dog saved his family's life, calling the five-year-old Russell Terrier a 'hero'.

Eventually Mrs Denby gave in to the canine's yapping and found the fire in her en-suite bathroom.

'I opened the door and the smoke and fumes just hit me. They singed my face.

'It was terrifying but my main priority was to get the girls out. Pepper already knew - she got herself out.

'You hear of animals saving people’s lives and that really was the case - she brought my attention to it and if she hadn’t it could have been much worse. She is a hero.'

The bedroom and bathroom have been left a shell, the whole house covered in a layer of soot, and Mrs Denby lost her clothes to the fire.

It has prompted fire officers to renew calls for people to test their smoke alarms. They said that had the alarms been working in the Denby household, the response would have been faster.

Mr Denby, who owns Damson Dene Hotel, in Kendal, Cumbria, was also told that had the fire started when his wife was asleep, she would have been dead without an alarm.

Mrs Denby said it was ‘just an oversight’ that the detectors were not in order. 'Of course now I will get a working smoke alarm fitted very soon. I would also say to other people, you just do not know when it is going to happen,' she said.
