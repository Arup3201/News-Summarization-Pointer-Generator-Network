Hit: Noel Edmonds and Mr Blobby were once the main attraction of Saturday early evening television and now Simon Cowell wants to replicate their success

Simon Cowell is planning to launch an ambitious game show – billed as a cross between Noel’s House Party and The Generation Game – which would see him dominating Saturday night TV.

Cowell, 53, is putting together a pitch for the as yet unnamed project with his television production company SyCo.

It would air over the autumn TV season in the teatime slot that was once home to Mr Blobby.

The
programme, which could be on screen as early as September 2014, is 
expected to be the subject of a fierce bidding war between ITV and BBC1.

Both
channels are keen to fill the slot before their peak-time reality shows
Strictly Come Dancing and The X Factor with a ratings-winning series.

It could mean Cowell, who is believed 
to be worth £200 million and is in negotiations to keep The X Factor on 
ITV, controlling up to four hours of Saturday night television. The new 
family show – like The X Factor – would run for two hours.

A production source said: ‘There are lots of ideas being talked about but this is the one that we are most excited about.

‘The
series would be a family-style game show, featuring parents and their 
children competing for prizes in quizzes and games in a similar vein to 
something like Noel’s House Party, Family Fortunes or The Generation 
Game.

‘It is not a reality TV format in any way. The idea is for it to run in an early-evening weekend slot, probably on Saturday nights, starting around 5.30 to 6pm when families have got in for the evening and are watching together.

'It’s not a replacement for something like The X Factor – it would run before that. ‘It is still at a very early stage but 
once the programme is more polished and ready to be taken to 
commissioners, we would be  having talks with all the broadcasters, not 
just ITV.’

The Saturday teatime slot is a crucial 
battleground in the autumn ratings war, with peak-time shows such as 
Strictly Come Dancing and The X Factor boosted by inheriting millions of
viewers from programmes earlier in the evening.

ITV currently faces a gap in its Saturday night schedule following the departure of comedian Harry Hill last year. Hill, 48, whose popular sketch show Harry Hill’s TV Burp ran for 11 years on ITV, filmed what was believed to be his final programme in March. The irreverent series was watched by seven million viewers a week.

The BBC also faces a gap in its schedule for a teatime ratings hit after announcing that its long-running family fantasy drama series, Merlin, would be axed after five years. The series drew audiences of nearly seven million.

ITV has a £100 million deal with Cowell to screen The X Factor and its sister series Britain’s Got Talent, which stars Alesha Dixon, David Walliams and Amanda Holden as judges. The current deal expires at the end of this year and negotiations are believed to be under way about keeping both programmes on air in 2014.

Last night a spokesman for SyCo declined to comment.
