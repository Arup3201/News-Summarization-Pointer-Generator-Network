Members of America's 'Greatest Generation' have descended upon Washington D.C. from all over the country - many for the first time - to visit the memorials dedicated to their service and sacrifice.

Veterans from World War II, Vietnam and the Korean War started touching down in the nation's Capitol from Thursday, in an emotional trip that allowed them to reminisce their service days - and be appreciated for them.

For many of the soldiers, it was their first look at the now 10-year-old WWII Memorial.

Mostly all of them flown in for free through state-run charity programs, the veterans also visited the Iwo Jima Memorial, the Korean War Memorial and Arlington National Cemetery, among other sights.

They toured the city on chartered buses with a police escort.

'We went through red lights and everything with sirens blaring,' 92-year-old Irving 'Chick' Borta, of Grand Haven, Michigan, told The Grand Haven Tribune.

'That was exciting.'

'It was wonderful, all of it.

'It's the first time anything like this has ever happened to me.

'It flooded my mind with memories. '

Each veteran was accompanied by a caregiver, usually a family member.
