Worrying: Britain could be hit with a major outbreak of flu after doctors reported a massive increase in cases of the potentially deadly virus

Britain could be hit with a major outbreak of flu after doctors reported a massive increase in cases of the potentially deadly virus.

Health experts have revealed that the number of people visiting their GPs has increased by almost 50 per cent in two weeks.

This comes as the UK is still recovering from the worst norovirus outbreak in years - with 1.1million people struck down by the winter vomiting bug.

Yesterday, the Health Protection Agency revealed that consultation rates in England rose from 23 per 100,000 in mid December to 33 per 100,000 in the week ending December 30.

Meanwhile, 2.1 per cent of the calls received by NHS Direct concerned flu compared to 1.6 per cent the previous week.

However, it is feared the situation could be far worse because many GP surgeries were closed over the festive period.

Professor John Watson, head of the respiratory disease department at the HPA said:

'The latest data should be interpreted with caution due to GP practices being closed on the bank holidays which may have impacted on GP consultation rates.

'It is vital that those who are most ‘at risk’ from flu make sure they receive their vaccination as this is the most effective way of preventing them from becoming ill with the virus.

These ‘at risk’ groups include people with weakened immune systems, those with underlying conditions such as liver, lung or renal diseases, heart problems or diabetes, as well as the over 65s and pregnant women.'

Experts warned this week that around 100,000 people were struck down with the winter vomiting bug over Christmas - and cases will continue to rise

Figures showed the number of confirmed cases was 72 per cent higher than this time last year.

The dramatic rise was attributed in part to an early outbreak of the 
illness which closed dozens of hospital wards as it swept across the 
country.

A total of 3,877 laboratory-confirmed cases of norovirus have now been 
recorded in England and Wales - up on the 2,255 of last year.

But the Health Protection Agency (HPA) said that for every reported 
case, an estimated 288 were not flagged up, meaning around 1.12 million 
people could now have contracted the illness this season.

Flu symptoms include the sudden onset of fever, a cough with a sore throat, and aching muscles and joints.

If you are otherwise healthy and are suffering from flu, you should stay at home, rest, drink plenty of fluids and take pain relievers such as paracetamol. Children under 16 should not take any medication containing aspirin.
