Ofsted inspectors have been offered counselling after a 'troubling incident' caused a school inspection to be cut short.

The inspectors were asked to leave the renowned Newcastle College - rated one of the top further education institutions in England - after a dispute with teachers over the way the inspection was conducted.

The inspection results would currently see the Newcastle College - part of the Newcastle College Group that also incorporates West Lancashire College and Intraining based in Sheffield - downgraded from its outstanding status to good. 

Chief Executive of Newcastle College Group Dame Jackie Fisher has made an official complaint about 'some troubling incidents' during an Ofsted inspection at Newcastle College

Chief executive of the Newcastle College Group Jackie Fisher - who was made a Dame in 2010 for her outstanding contribution to further education - has now told staff she now plans to challenge Ofsted’s decision.

She has formally complained about the behaviour of some inspectors following the visits in May and June.

An email to staff said: 'Unfortunately the inspection came to an untimely end as a result of some troubling incidents.

'However, we finally agreed to allow the inspectors to return and the on-site inspection of NCG has now been included.'

The e-mail from Dame Fisher - who was also awarded a CBE in 2005 - adds: 'Many of you are aware that the Ofsted inspection was not entirely trouble-free.

'We are planning to pursue with Ofsted some outstanding matters which may improve the grade profile.

'However, based on Oftsed’s track record in listening to provider complaints, this must be viewed as unlikely, regardless of how strong our case is.'

Chief inspector of schools, Sir Michael Wilshaw, introduced a tougher inspection regime for Ofsted

Ofsted’s inspection saw much of the college’s work rated as good rather than outstanding, a move which will come as a blow to a college rated by the Department for Education earlier this year as the number one general further education institution in England for 16 to 18-year-old achievement.

Ofsted's inspectors are reportedly now being offered counselling after the incident.

NCG has been at the centre of political controversy over the last two years, with Newcastle Council withdrawing co-operation on one of its projects in opposition to NCG’s plan to open a free school.

Ministers last week turned down NCG’s plans.

A spokesman for NCG said: 'This briefing was a private memo to staff to update them on the inspection.

'We are awaiting the full report from Ofsted.

'However, their provisional findings say several areas of our teaching are outstanding and the majority are good.

'However, we are very concerned with the way the inspection was conducted and there were some troubling incidents which meant the inspection ended before it was complete.

'We agreed inspectors could return to complete the inspection last week. We have officially complained to Ofsted and are awaiting their response.

'It would not be appropriate to comment further at this stage.'

'Troubling incident': Ofsted inspectors were asked to leave Newcastle College in the middle of an inspection

An Ofsted spokeswoman said: 'While Ofsted does not comment on individual complaints, we do take complaints very seriously, investigating each one rigorously and dealing with issues as quickly as possible.”

Ofsted has introduced a tougher inspection regime under new Chief Inspector of Schools, Sir Michael Wilshaw, which makes it harder for schools to make the grade.

In April the National Union of Teachers’ annual conference voted to boycott the inspection body over the changes to the way it rates schools.
