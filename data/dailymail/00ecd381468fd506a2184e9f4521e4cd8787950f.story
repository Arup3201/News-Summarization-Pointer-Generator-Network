God remains a major presence in the mist-swathed hills of West Wales.

Most towns and villages, however small, are still dominated by a handsome chapel or Anglican church. But dark forces are at work.

The 2012 census suggested that Wales is ‘the witch capital’ of the United Kingdom, revealing it is home to 83 self-described witches and 93 Satanists.

Reverend Felix Aubel has said he has seen many cases of witchcraft and has told of how locals have gone to him for help after being cursed by witches who blackmail victims for money

‘It’s an alarming figure, and there are indications that there are a lot more who wouldn’t confess to being witches,’ says the Reverend Dr Felix Aubel, 52, a Congregational minister for five chapels.

In a new memoir, Dr Aubel says that during his 19 years as a minister in Cardiganshire and Carmarthenshire, he has seen many cases of witchcraft — ‘in the high dozens’ — and tells how terrified locals have gone to him for help after being cursed by witches who blackmail victims for money.

Dr Aubel says he has evidence that the witches promise spiritual help then cast spells on people if they don’t pay for the ‘service’ — a sort of Satanic protection racket.

Others apparently use effigies — or ‘poppets’, as they are known locally — in an attempt to put spells on enemies. Made out of fruit, paper, wax, potato or grain, ‘poppets’ are pierced in the heart with sharp needles, in the hope that the same pain will be visited on the victims.

Rev Aubel has detailed how he come across the use of effigies, the 'evil eye' and witches during his time as a church minister

Impossible to credit? Not according to Dr Aubel. One of his chapel members in Aberaeron was victimised in this way after falling out with another worshipper.

A witch was asked by a former church member to create a ‘poppet’ of someone. The reason one woman was targeted was because of a row between the two women.

The case predated Dr Aubel’s ministry, but he witnessed its evil effects.

‘The motivation was envy that had turned into jealousy — envy then evolved into paranoid hatred,’ says Dr Aubel.

Rev Aubel has revealed witchcraft is thriving across rural parishes in Wales in his autobiography

‘The woman had gone to an English witch who lived outside Lampeter in order to find a way of punishing the other woman. She then told her victim that the witch had made a poppet of her and was attacking it.

‘The psychological pressure destabilised the victim and turned her into a nervous wreck. I had to convince her that there was nothing wrong with her.’

He said he asked an experienced Anglican exorcist to lift the ‘curse’.

‘I’ve got an open mind on the subject,’ continues Dr Aubel, ‘but it doesn’t matter whether you say there’s a basis to it or not. If it’s real to the victims, it’s real: people can still be destroyed as a result. It ruins family life and careers; and some victims even take their own lives.’ Dr Aubel also has experience of the so-called ‘evil eye’ — an ancient belief that some people have the power to create evil simply by looking at someone else.

He gives the example of a woman who had given birth to a baby boy and who was given the ‘evil eye’ by a childless spinster neighbour. Dr Aubel says: ‘Both mother and child were subsequently taken ill, due to acute breathlessness. There was no apparent medical reason or  explanation. Mother and child had to go to hospital.’

Next, the spinster visited the hospital ward, where, coincidentally, Dr Aubel was visiting the new mother.

He noticed that the other visitor ‘praised the baby to its mother in a very false and patronising way’.

Such fake flattery is, he says, ‘one of the most noticeable characteristics of the utilisation of the “evil eye”.’

The reverend, fearing for the child, asked the spinster to make amends, by saying ‘God bless you’ to the baby.

But he says: ‘The idea of  saying “God bless you” was anathema to a witch. Her face froze.

‘She was extremely bitter and jealous that she had no children herself. With these witches, there’s often an extreme bitterness and an underlying hatred towards their fellow human beings. They are motivated primarily by hatred for humanity.’

Eventually the woman left the hospital.

As for the mother of the baby, when she recovered, she put a horseshoe in the porch of her home in order to protect her son

and herself from the malevolent effects of the ‘evil eye’.

Of course, there have been reports of witchcraft in Wales for centuries — a hangover from pre-Roman days of paganism and Celtic druids.

‘In many rural areas, the old religion, the worshipping of pagan deities, continued in the local folk customs,’ says Dr Aubel.

‘In more industrial parts of Wales, the influx of people meant that old customs disappeared. But in more remote areas, it lived on. These old beliefs were passed on from generation to generation.’

In the early 1900s, there was apparently a notorious family of witches who became members of Caersalem Baptist Chapel in Pembrokeshire. Dr Aubel says that one of his deacons in Aberaeron had a grandmother who was a well-known witch and who is now buried in the chapel cemetery.

‘I have been told that a coven of witches still meets in the Trelech area,’ says Dr Aubel. ‘Until recently, the witch of Talog — a village about six miles from here — was advertising in the local paper, offering cultist services.’

Those included spells — or ‘curses’ and divination, or analysis of  the future.

The witch of Talog also provided sessions with tarot cards and Ouija boards and witch initiation ceremonies with the use of pentagrams (symbols of the power of the spirit), dancing and group rituals.

‘It’s all mumbo-jumbo — but it still has a negative effect on those who believe in it,’ says Dr Aubel.

The minister thinks there are several factors behind the growth in witchcraft. ‘It seems to increase during bad economic times,’ he says.

‘It was at its worst in 2008 to 2009, and it was bad during the mid-Nineties.

‘Witchcraft has grown in a spiritual vacuum — the latest figures show the number of Christians in this country has dropped from 72 per cent to 59 per cent. People are looking for a purpose in their life, for some sort of spiritual movement.

The church minister has told of how he had to call out an exorcist, similar to the 1973 classic film, after a parishioner was cursed by a witch

‘Witchcraft offers an apparent spiritual quick-fix when there’s financial debt, marriage breakdown, or an emptiness in people’s lives.

‘I fear that witches are ruthlessly exploiting people’s weaknesses, emotional needs and problems.’

He says older church members are not affected, but that people in their late-teens or early 20s are susceptible. Others who are vulnerable are those with children in their late-teens, who are suffering money and job troubles.

Dr Aubel says: ‘They are often single parents who don’t know where to turn, and suddenly they’re offered a solution. The witch of Talog even said it in her advert — she offered “problem solutions”.’

Undeniably, Wales is a land where tales of the occult and paranormal abound.

After a Freedom of Information request in 2011, Dyfed-Powys Police revealed that, in its area over the previous five years, there had been 14 UFO sightings, 26 reports of ghosts, 11 of witches and two of zombies and vampires.

In one report, someone said they had been force-fed a furball during a witchcraft ritual.

In Llanelli, a man told police that a coven of witches wanted to sacrifice him. He had, it must be conceded, been drinking. Someone else claimed her mother was a ‘black witch’.

In 2011, there was a report to officers of ‘malicious communication; rumours that an individual’s mother is a witch’.

Welsh witch: Wales is home to 83 self-described witches

Another caller to the police reported ‘that one individual is a witch and had attended at the house to put salt around the bed’.

According to medieval superstition, salt can be used to ward off evil.

But while Dr Aubel is concerned by such reports, he is sceptical that witchcraft actually works: ‘The witches are charlatans — they make it all superficially attractive, and might even give quite effective advice about, say, debt-solving to begin with.

‘They create a cult mentality, like the Moonies or the Scientologists. Then, if someone tries to withdraw from their control and stops paying, the witches cast a spell.’

He goes on to warn: ‘If you use them, they’ll usually insist on coming to your house. Then they can take something of yours — a photo, say — so they can later use it as psychological blackmail. They’ll send back the photo of you with the eyes torn out, to scare you.’

Dr Aubel says he doesn’t confront the witches personally. His priority is to wean victims off their ‘negative influence’.

‘I’m just trying to offer an academic, rational solution and to tell people not to dabble in this world — it’s so very counterproductive. People get sucked into something that’s beyond their control.’
