Police have launched an investigation after finding $3 million worth of missing shoes at a central Kentucky home.

Officers with the Radcliff Police Department confiscated thousands of pairs of Nike shoes that were scattered in front of the home for a yard sale.

According to a search warrant filed last week, the shoes were supposed to be shipped in 2009 from a Nike distribution center in Tennessee to another one in Texas, but never made it.

The women who were in possession of the shoes said they had purchased them from someone else and didn't know they were stolen.

They said they were selling them at a flea market for $5 a pair.

'Apparently Nike had called and contacted them and the shoes were stolen and they had been stolen since 2009 and there was $3 million worth of shoes in my front yard', the seller told WLKY-TV.

The seller's daughter was apparently wearing a pair of Air Jordans from the collection and said: 'I can't even tell you how many shoes we had, it was unbelievable.

'There were flip flops, there was Jennifer Lopez and Kim Kardashian heels... Expensive shoes.'

She added that they were making $200 every two hours from the sales.

No arrests have been made and police are still investigating.
