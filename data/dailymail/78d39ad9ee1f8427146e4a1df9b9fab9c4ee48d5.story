Master of evasion: Makers of a new Discovery channel documentary said that of all 19 living presidential chiefs of staff, Rahm Emanuel was the 'most challenging'

Makers of the upcoming Discovery network documentary on presidential chiefs of staff have a perfect participation record, but not all the subjects were equally eager to share tales from the White House.

All 19 living men who had that job gave interviews for The Presidents' Gatekeepers, the four-hour documentary that is expected to air this summer, but Barack Obama's famously pugnacious former chief of staff Rahm Emanuel was a reluctant subject. 

Filmmakers Jules and Gedeon Naudet both agreed that Emanuel, who is the current mayor of Chicago, was the 'most challenging' to deal with.

Most of the participants, including Secretary of Defense Leon Panetta, who served as chief of staff under Bill Clinton, spent three-four hours being interviewed for the film, but Emanuel compressed the long interview into a 15-minute chat, and even then he had objections, according to executive producer Chris Whipple.

Looking at some filming equipment, he reportedly told the producers, ‘What the bleep is this? It looks like Guantanamo,’ Whipple told USA Today.

Witness to history: Although he stayed for about 15 minutes, Emanuel told the creators of the film about his first stressful day in the White House

According to the team behind the documentary, Emanuel, who gained notoriety for his aggressive attitude and ability to bend members of Congress to his will, proved to be an expert at evading questions, but also showed himself a masterful storyteller.

Whipple told The Hollywood Reporter that Emanuel described for them his first day on the job, when he had to march straight into the situation room to deal with a terrorist threat on the south lawn of the White House while juggling an economic crisis and a failing auto industry.

The makers of the documentary said Saturday that their well-regarded previous documentary on the September 11 terrorist attack in New York was a calling card that probably helped them convince some former chiefs to get on board.

They shot about 70 hours of interviews that have been cut down to four hours that will be aired in two parts.

September 11 likely helped them convince all 19 living chiefs of staff 
to sit down for interviews

Their longest interview was with former Vice President Dick Cheney, who was President Gerald Ford's chief of staff in the 1970s. Cheney said that a chief is more powerful than a vice president – a position that he held under President George W. Bush.

The film sheds light on White House officials whose job is to stay in the shadow of the president and make sure that the complex political mechanism runs smoothly. The documentary also offers a new behind-the-scenes perspective on key historical events.

During the interview, Jimmy Carter's chief of staff Jack Watson talked about the Iran hostage crisis, while Lyndon Johnson's chief of staff Bill Watson revealed that his boss narrowly averted World War III during the 1967 six-day war in Israel.

‘It was a chance for once to have their side of the story told,’ Naudet said.

The creators of the documentary hope to interview President Obama, George W. Bush and Bill Clinton before the film premieres in July.
