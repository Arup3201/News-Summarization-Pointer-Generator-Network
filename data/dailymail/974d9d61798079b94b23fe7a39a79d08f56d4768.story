Lung cancer cases are on the rise among women, despite a sharp drop for men over the past two decades.

One woman was diagnosed for every three men back in 1990. But this has now doubled to two women for every three male cases, the latest figures from the National Cancer Intelligence Network show.

Specialists say this reflects the fact many men quit smoking from the 1950s onwards.

But at the same time, women started to take up the habit in large numbers, often as a way to lose weight, after being targeted by tobacco industry marketing.

This means the true lung cancer toll for older women has taken longer to emerge.

Despite the rising number of female cases, more people are surviving the disease, particularly women. In 1990, just 17 per cent of patients of both sexes lived for a year after diagnosis.

By 2010, this had risen to 29 per cent of men and 33 per cent of women. Although lung cancer is known as a ‘smoker’s disease’, up to one in eight sufferers has never smoked.

In the UK, lung cancer is the biggest 
cause of cancer death in women claiming around 16,000 lives a year 
compared with 12,000 from breast cancer.

Dr Mick Peake of the National Cancer Intelligence Network said: ‘This report shows that we are gradually making inroads into improving the survival from this common cancer.

The drop in male lung cancer reflects the numbers who quit smoking from the 1950s onwards

'The improvement in survival in lung 
cancer has been dramatic over the last 20 years with almost twice as 
many patients alive a year after diagnosis now as was the case in 1990.

'I
 think this reflects a combination of the better organisation of cancer 
services, the availability of better treatments and earlier diagnosis.

'Our
 one-year survival figures show that we are now approaching the outcomes
 those of other countries where the survival has historically been 
significantly better than in England.

'However, there is much more to be done for lung cancer patients with the majority still dying within a year of diagnosis.'

Paula Chadwick, chief executive of the Roy Castle Lung Cancer Foundation, added: ‘It is vitally important that women become just as aware of the symptoms of lung cancer as they are of breast cancer, as the earlier they are diagnosed the more chance they have of surviving.

‘So, we would urge anyone with a persistent cough or who is feeling tired and breathless to see their GP as it could just save their life.’

Nick Ormiston-Smith, Cancer Research UK's head of statistics, said 'It's great news that lung cancer in men has fallen by more than a third since the early 1990s.

'Trends in lung cancer incidence rates reflect past trends in cigarette smoking - many men quit smoking from the 1950s onwards, so we are now seeing the positive impact of that.

'Unfortunately this smoking fall didn't occur for women until later - after they had become the core targets of the tobacco industry's marketing strategy, so their lung cancer rates are still increasing.'

Professor Kevin Fenton, Director of Health and Wellbeing at Public Health England said 'Smoking is one of the main causes of lung cancer, and survival, whilst improving, is very poor. This report shows that less than a third (30 per cent) of people diagnosed with lung cancer in 2010 will survive the first year, and whilst we do not know yet how many of these will still be alive at 5 years, it is not likely to be greater than 10 or 11 per cent.'
