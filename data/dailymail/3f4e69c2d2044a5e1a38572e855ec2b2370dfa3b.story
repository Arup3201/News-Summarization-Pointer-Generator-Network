Chemist Direct claims that sales of products such as Slimfast and BioBurn have risen by 46 per cent

If you are frantically trying to get in shape for the summer after a failed New Year diet, you are not alone.

An online pharmacy has reported that demand for slimming products has soared in the last month.

Chemist Direct claims that sales of such products were 46 per cent higher in March than they were in January.

Omar El-Gohary, Superintendent Pharmacist at Chemist Direct, said: ‘These are boomerang dieters who with the best intentions started dieting in January, but gave up after a few weeks.

'With summer around the corner, they are now having another go.’

The figures come after a survey by weight loss firm XLS-Medical revealed that the vast majority of people fail to stick to their diets for more than five days a week.

It also found that 20 per cent of dieters admit to having their first diet relapse just four days into their diet.

Most reported that hunger was the main reason for their diet failure.

Chemist Direct believes that the rise in demand for slimming products such as Slimfast, Alli and Bioburn may have been caused by people wanting to get in shape for beach holidays in the May half term.

Easter may also have played a part, with people returning to the fattening foods they had given up for Lent.

Mr El-Gohary explained that overindulgence at Easter is likely to be a cause as Chemist Direct has also seen a surge in sales of indigestion treatments such as Alka-Seltzer and Rennie.

The company says many of these people are 'boomerang dieters' who started dieting in January with the best intentions, but gave up after a few weeks

He said: ‘Indigestion causes pain or 
discomfort in the stomach and chest after eating and other symptoms 
include nausea, heartburn and feeling bloated.

‘We saw a rise in the number of customers contacting us for advice on treating indigestion, and many admitted they had overindulged on rich foods and were suffering as a result.’

Based on orders, Chemist Direct has compiled a top ten of indigestion hotspots in the UK, with the top place going to Liverpool, closely followed by London and Brighton.

Also making the top ten were Bristol, Manchester, Birmingham, Coventry, Stirling, Wigan and Blackburn.
