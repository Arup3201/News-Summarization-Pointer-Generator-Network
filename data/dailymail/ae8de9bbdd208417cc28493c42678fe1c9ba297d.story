She said the lady was not for turning on Greece - but German Chancellor Angela Merkel has in fact made a sharp U-turn and now wants to stop Athens from leaving the eurozone at all costs.

'For the German leader, it is essential to avoid the consequences of a Grexit before national elections next year,' said influential national news magazine Der Spiegel today.

'Merkel has already made up her mind. After long hesitation, she has sided with French President Francois Hollande and the European Commission.

Could it be worse than 2008? Mrs Merkel, pictured at the Bundestag today, is very concerned about the affect a 'Grexit' could have on the German economy

'The report from the troika - which 
consists of the European Commission, the International Monetary Fund and
 the European Central Bank and which departed on its fact-finding tour 
last week - will undoubtedly conclude that Greece can remain in the 
eurozone.'

Sources 
close to the chancellery say Mrs Merkel fears a worse impact on the 
German economy if Greece is forced out than the fallout from the 
collapse of the American bank Lehman Brothers in 2008.

That implosion cost Germany five per cent of its GDP and hundreds of thousands of jobs.

Der
 Spiegel added: 'Until recently, Merkel was prepared to drop the country
 if it failed to meet its commitments.

'She now regards a Greek 
departure from the eurozone as entailing too many risks.

'But the political costs are also too high for Merkel.

'If Greece withdrew from the eurozone, her advisers fear that this could mean that it would eventually be necessary to create a common "debt union" to stabilise problem countries like Italy and Spain.

'It would be a paradoxical situation: Germany would take a hard-line approach with Greece, but might subsequently have to accept jointly issued euro bonds, which German voters widely oppose.'

The ECB's controversial decision last Thursday to purchase, if necessary, unlimited quantities of sovereign bonds from struggling eurozone member states has chilled the hearts of German voters - some 54 per cent of people oppose the move, according to a poll published today.

Mrs Merkel, who has been widely criticised for wanting to lead Europe without a concrete plan to do so, is facing further criticism for her U-turn on Greece.

The future's orange: The chancellor looked worried at the first session of the budget 2013 debate in Berlin

Der Spiegel added; 'So the chancellor has made up her mind, and will now continue to muddle along as usual. The problem will be put on ice for now, and re-addressed sometime after the 2013 Bundestag election - when the current rescue program has ended.

'It's clear, though, that it will probably take decades for cash-strapped Greece to modernize itself. The risks and possible side effects of Merkel's approach are obvious. Once Greece receives more money, the danger increases that the government in Athens will postpone its promised reforms. It wouldn't be the first time.'

The magazine went on: 'When Greek Prime Minister Samaras visited Berlin recently, he was left in the dark about the degree to which the Germans' view has changed. Instead, Merkel announced internally that it was necessary to continue to exert maximum pressure on the prime minister so he would implement the required reforms. At the same time, she praised her counterpart from Athens.'

Mrs Merkel said that Samaras is playing a 'historic role' for his country, adding that she was very impressed with what he had to say. 'We have to give him a chance,' she said.

'And Merkel intends to see that he soon gets his opportunity. Her plan calls for the troika's report to present the situation in Greece as less disastrous than previously expected, as this is a necessary prerequisite for disbursement of the next tranche of aid.'

She told her staff last week: 'We have to find a solution,'

Mrs Merkel is said to be optimistic that they will eventually go along with her approach. The IMF statutes may be strict, but the agreements with aid recipients - in this case Greece - nevertheless offer a great deal of leeway.

Der Spiegel added: 'Merkel, whose father was a pastor in communist Eastern Germany, has suddenly discovered a deep affection for the downtrodden people of Greece. She compassionately expressed empathy for 'what many in Greece have to suffer', and said 'it does make one's heart bleed.'

We can't afford to cast Greece out: Mrs Merkel believes the cautious electorate will soon come around to her way of thinking

This is code for her and her ministers being acutely aware that if Greece falls, Germany will have to pay - and the bill will come to almost exactly €62billion euros: the sum Greece owes the Fatherland.

Of course, that would not be the end of the euro tragedy: to protect the remaining financially weak countries like Portugal and Ireland, along with Spain and Italy, hundreds of billions of euros would have to be mobilised.

Spiegel went on to say that 'Merkel is keeping her eye on the "big picture".' The chancellor reportedly feels that the EU cannot afford to allow democracy to falter in a member state. She also points out that Greece is a NATO member and an important ally in the eastern Mediterranean - a region that has enough flashpoints as it is.

'Her new, lenient approach has the advantage that it could allow her to reach the election next September without the turbulence of a Greek exit from the monetary union,' said the magazine. 'In return, she is prepared to play for high stakes.

'She is putting off dealing with Greece until sometime in the future.'

If she's lucky, the Greeks will have got back on their feet by then, and will need less money because the reforms pursued in their country will have finally proven effective. If she's unlucky, Merkel will be plugging holes by making new ones elsewhere - and it may all come to a head once the election is over.

'Another possibility is that the Greek economy performs so poorly that the money runs out before the rescue package expires. This would be the worst-case scenario for Merkel. Nevertheless, she is consciously taking this risk. She sees it as manageable - unlike a Greek exit from the eurozone.'
