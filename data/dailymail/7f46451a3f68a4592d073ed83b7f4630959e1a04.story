Once upon a time pillbox hats, wiggle dresses and summer gloves were the usual attire for women popping to the shops.

Men, meanwhile, stepped out in dapper three-piece suits paired with top hats, neat moustaches and monocles.

For many, these were the good old days of style. But that style is by no means lost forever and for some recreating it helps define their current look. In fact some vintage aficionados spend lots of time and money painstakingly recreating fashions from the 1930s-50s - some even committing to their look 24 hours a day, seven days a week - and now they have the opportunity to be recognised for their efforts.

Twinwood Festival, near Bedford, now in its 13th year, celebrates the style and music of the 1930s, 40s and 50s.

And this year for the first time, the most stylish vintage guy or gal will be crowned Mr or Miss Vintage and win an array of prizes in the first UK wide annual vintage style contest.

In a unique chance for candidates to show off their vintage credentials, Mr and Miss Vintage potentials will be judged on hairstyle, 
make-up, clothes and accessories by a panel including 
vintage style icon Lola Lamour.

With a standout re-enactment singing career and a classic 40s wardrobe, Lola makes the perfect judge

Lola
 is one of the best known 1940s singers on the circuit and was featured in Channel 4 documentary Time Warp Wives. Her clothes, car and house are all based upon the styles of the 1940s and 50s.

With a standout re-enactment singing career, a classic 40s-inspired wardrobe and home, Lola makes the perfect head judge and presenter.

Joined by her co-presenters and judges Dusty Limits and 
Mark Ewing, she will be running the rule over the finalists at the 
Twinwood Festival, now
 in its 13th year.

Marcella Puppini of retro singing trio The Puppini Sisters will also be on hand to award the prizes which will be handed out from organisations including  vintage-style fashion label Vivien of 
Holloway, Vintage Life Magazine, vintage dressmaking fabric company Til The Sun Goes Down, and more.

Organisers
 stress that Miss Vintage UK and Mr Vintage UK is 
unlike any other beauty contest in that age and body shape are not a 
factor – simply the ability to capture the spirit of the era.

Twinwood Festival celebrates all things vintage from August 23 through 25
