A beautiful picture of a carefree Angelina Jolie posing with a white horse will lead a sale of photographs at London auction house Christie's next month.

The never-before-seen image by celebrated photographer David LaChapelle is expected to fetch between £25,000 and £35,000 when it goes under the hammer as part of The Wild Side of Photography sale.

The colour snap from 2001 features the actress as a 25-year-old throwing back a mane of brunette hair and showing off some of her many tattoos, including a 'Billy Bob' drawing on her arm, a homage to her then husband which has now been erased.
