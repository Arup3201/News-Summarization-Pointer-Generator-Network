A bolt of lightning caused serious damage to a church when it struck the bell tower and caused one of its turrets to explode.

Worshippers were left stunned to find a gaping hole in the roof of the church in Pillaton, near Saltash, Cornwall, after a storm swept over the region late on Monday.

Most buildings in the area managed to avoid damage, but St Odulph Church suffered a direct hit when a bolt of lightning struck the church steeple.

Devastation: Church warden Richard Lowther assesses damage to the church which was struck by a bolt of lightning during a storm on Monday

Damage: Slate tiles on the roof of the church were smashed by the flying debris, which left wood dangling precariously near to the pulpit

It caused flying rubble to smash slate tiles on the church's roof and left huge pieces of wood precariously dangling into the church below, close to the pulpit.

Church warden Richard Lowther said everything in the church had been affected, including the roof, pews and other furnishings.

He said: 'We won't be able to hold services until... I don't know how long.

'We estimate the damage will be in excess of £500,000, at a very minimum, to repair.'

He said the first work to be carried out would be to prevent water getting into the building and causing further damage.

Bell ringing captain Richard Warwick said Pillaton residents had been 'shaken from their beds' during the thunderstorm.

Structural damage: The lightning bolt left a gaping hole in the ceiling of the church after it struck the bell tower

Cost to repair: The damage is estimated to cost at least £500,000 to fix

He said: 'There's pretty major structural damage to the church.

'One of the four pinnacles on the roof, which weigh several tonnes, has exploded and the main part of it has made a huge gaping hole in the body of the main church.

'We don't know about the bells yet because we're not allowed up there to take a look.'

Nearby pub The Weary Friar also saw damage to its picnic benches from the falling debris of the church.

Protected: The parish church, which became a listed building in 1968, is made from slatestone rubble with granite dressing

Parishioner Tony Rowe, who is organising repairs following the devastation at the church, said: 'One of the turrets on the tower exploded.

'There are around four or five holes on the roof of the church. Also some of the stone fell in front of the pub.'

Mr Rowe said he feared work to repair the damage could take a long time.

He said: 'We are having emergency roofing put on the building to secure it.'

Storm: Residents in the village were 'shaken from their beds' during the thunderstorm which struck on Monday night

The church has been closed to the public while it is made safe, secure and water tight.

The Weary Friar is a 12th Century country inn that was originally used to house the builders of the church and then became a rest-house inn.

A spokesman for the pub said: 'There is no real damage to the pub building but a power surge took out the computers and phones, which I think happened across the village. Our credit card machines are also down.

'Some of the stone from the church fell onto one of our picnic benches outside and smashed it in half which we'll have to replace, but the pub itself hasn't been damaged.'
