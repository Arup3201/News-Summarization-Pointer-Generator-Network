Nike has filed a lawsuit against three of its former footwear designers seeking $10million in damages over allegations that they stole 'a treasure trove' of trade secrets before joining its arch-rival Adidas.

High-ranking designers Marc Dolce, Mark Miner and Denis Dekovic announced their departure from Nike in September to join Adidas at its new design studio - dubbed the Brooklyn Creative Studio in Brooklyn, New York.

In the lawsuit, a copy of which was published on digital library Scribd, Nike alleges that this new studio is essentially a knock-off of its own Portland Oregeon-based hub, The Innovation Kitchen, and that its former designers had been 'conspiring' with Adidas to 'develop a blueprint' since April.

Sued: Former Nike designers Mark Miner (left), Denis Dekovic (center) and Marc Dolce (right) stand accused of stealing intellectual property to take jobs at Adidas, then destroying the evidence 

Mr Dolce was formerly Nike's global basketball and training design director, Mr Dekovich was the brand's global football design director and Mr Miner was a senior global footwear designer.

According to Nike's allegations, the designers stole 'future strategic development plans, product launches, unreleased product technology, virtual testing methodologies and marketing campaign materials.'

Nike further claims that before the designers left their positions, they erased incriminating emails and text messages in a bid to hide 'evidence of their betrayals.'

Mr Dekovic responded by releasing a statement on behalf on himself, Mr Dolce and Mr Miner via his Twitter account on Tuesday.

'We find Nike's allegations hurtful because they are either false or are misleading half-truths,' it said. 'We did not take trade secrets or intellectual property when we departed Nike in September.

'During our entire careers at Nike... we collectively poured in hours, passion and dedication beyond what was asked or expected of us, often prioritizing our jobs over our families.

'Until the very end, we stayed engaged, loyal and committed.'

Nike claims the three designers 'conspired to and developed for themselves, and then for Adidas, a strategic blueprint for a creative design studio to compete against Nike.'

The company states it has spent more than $1.5million in the past three years to ensure that its employees keep information confidential and that it will 'continue to vigorously protect our intellectual property.'

Mr Dekovic confirmed his departure from Nike on Twitter in September, with the poetic post: 'GRATEFUL for the past, EXCITED for the future, 3 brothers, 3 dreamers, 3 stripes. #TeamAdidas 2015.'

Nike states in its legal complaint that its former designers 'boasted online about their new affiliation with Adidas to generate support for and lure other designers to join their enterprise.'

It added: 'Nike will suffer irreparable harm if this scheme is permitted to continue.'

Matt Powell, a sports industry analyst at the NPD Group, told The Washington Post.

'[Mr Devovik, Mr Dolce and Mr Miner] were all three rock stars of the design world. This is a huge loss for Nike and a gain for Adidas, and it’ll take many, many months for all this to play out.'
