Inspirational soldier: Mark Stebbing was crushed to death by a horse at a Help For Heroes parade held at Sandown

A soldier who survived having a leg amputated was killed when he was thrown from and then crushed by a horse during a Help for Heroes event, an inquest has heard.

Platoon Sergeant Mark Stebbing, 39, had undergone just one hour of riding tuition before mounting a large former racehorse named William at Sandown Park, Surrey.

As Sergeant Stebbing was being led back to the stables after the event the thoroughbred horse unexpectedly reared up, sending him tumbling off the back of the 16-hand steed - around six ft tall.

The former national hunt racehorse then fell backwards, crushing Sgt. Stebbing beneath him, shattering his pelvis along with his ribs and back vertebrae.

Sgt. Stebbing, who served in the Gulf War, was treated in hospital, but later died.

As a Platoon Sergeant serving with the Royal Electrical and Mechanical Engineers (REME) in Aldershot, Hampshire, Sgt. Stebbing was hailed as a role model by many of his colleagues thanks to the way he dealt with his life-changing amputation.

The soldier had been selected to take part in 
the event because he had given fellow servicemen reassurance on how
to cope with the loss of a limb.

He chose to have the dramatic surgery on his right leg in August 2008 after suffering complications when he broke both ankles during an Army drill.

His widow, Collette, told the inquest into her husband's death that her husband had been a keen charity fundraiser and had often acted as a mentor to younger soldiers who were living with similar injuries.

She said: 'There were two soldiers who had been injured and he had to go and talk to them.

'There was a young man who went through the same operation so Mark went round to speak to him and showed him his own leg.'

Mrs Stebbing said that her husband had been looking forward to taking part in the Heroes Parade at Sandown Park, organised by Battle Back, an initiative offering adventure training and sports rehabilitation for soldiers, which was backed by military charity Help for Heroes.

The Royal Engineer had only taken an hour-long riding lesson at Sandhurst Military Academy a week before the event and was feeling confident about his stint on horseback.

'He had been to Sandhurst for a riding lesson,' said Mrs Stebbing.

'He rode motorbikes and he did well in the lesson so he was allowed to take part.

'He was excited and looking forward to it.'

Other riders taking part in the parade on February 18 this year, were riding military horses but Sgt. Stebbing was given ex-racehorse William to ride in front of 5,000 spectators.

The original plan had been for seven soldiers to take part in a race but this was downgraded to a parade when there was not enough time to train the riders sufficiently.

There was concern when the horse reared slightly during the five-lap ride around the Surrey racecourse's parade ring but the soldier leading Sgt. Stebbing's was able to bring William under control.

However, as the horse and rider were being led back to the stable after the parade, William reared up again, only this time he could not be controlled and Sgt. Stebbing was thrown to the ground where the horse fell onto him.

Death fall: The accident happened at Sandown Park in Surrey and is best known for its racecourse

The soldier was taken to St. George's Hospital in Tooting, London, where he died on March 16 of bronchial pneumonia caused by the multiple injuries he sustained during the crush.

William's owner Carol Nash said that she had never known the horse to rear up before, and that it was used to being handled or ridden by different people.

However, she said she had been shocked when she learned Sgt. Stebbing had barely ridden before.

Other riders in the event had been given military horses from the King's Troop to ride, which the inquest at Woking Coroner's Court heard tended to be more docile, less easily spooked and more suitable for riders with limited experience.

'He went right over, which caused his injuries,' she said.

Charity: The event was organised by Battle Back and supported by the Help For Heroes campaign

'I'm not blaming anyone but it's very unfortunate.

'Thoroughbred horses are like Formula One cars and you have to treat them in a certain way, with a huge amount of respect.'

Mrs Nash said that Sgt. Stebbing had been using a custom-made saddle for William as well as her own stirrups, which she said would have been suitable for use with his prosthetic leg.

She said that it was likely that when the horse had reared up, as an inexperienced rider Sgt. Stebbing's reaction would have been to pull on the reins - which only would have made the situation worse.

A Health and Safety Executive investigation ruled that the accident could not have been forseen and that all procedures had been followed prior to the parade.

However, Lieutenant Colonel Reynold Blue who investigated Sgt. Stebbing's fall on behalf of the Army said that following the death he had recommended that at future events horses and riders should be matched according to capability, with injuries taken into account.

He said: 'At any event the competence of the rider should be assessed.

'There needs to be some form of standards assessment.'

He also said that horses and riders should train together prior to any event, preferably at the venue itself.

Surrey Coroner Michael Burgess recorded a verdict of accidental death.

'Mark Stebbing slipped off the back of the horse and in all probability him holding onto the reigns pulled the horse's head back, which would exacerbate the situation of the horse,' he said.
