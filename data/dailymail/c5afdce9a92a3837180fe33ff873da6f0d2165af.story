A father tragically fell to his death in front of his whole family as he put the finishing touches to the brickwork of an extension he was building on their home.

Paul Fenwick, 31, died instantly after hitting his head as he fell 14ft from the roof of the new building, which his heartbroken family say 'he was so proud of'.

The horrific accident at his home in Hull was witnessed by relatives, including his partner of 11 years Ixchel Morris, 28, and their two-year-old son Noah.

Mr Fenwick died falling from his extension just days after the birth of his daughter Emilia Chloe

Mr Fenwick had been building an extension and was putting the final touches to the brickwork when he fell

Mr Fenwick, called 'Podgie' by his family and friends, was still on paternity leave from the hospice where he worked following the birth of his daughter, Emilia Chloe, last month.

His father, also called Paul, said: 'Podgie was about to put the last few bricks onto the extension when he fell from a scaffolding tower.

'The whole family had come over. Everyone was there. We all saw it. We are still numb and trying to get through it day by day.'

Mr Fenwick Snr said his young grandson is aware of his father's death, which happened on July 1.

He said: 'Noah was there. It was traumatic. Noah ran up to Podgie shouting, "Daddy, Daddy".'

He added: 'I tried to keep everyone calm, as he 
would have wanted, and got everyone indoors, while we rang for an 
ambulance. We knew he had died instantly. There was no suffering.'

Mr Fenwick's father Paul, wife Ixchel and son Noah were among those who were watching him when he fell

Mr Fenwick said his son, his partner and Noah had moved into their home about 18 months ago.

He added: 'He had a lot of plans for that house. Every spare moment he had, he would be working on that extension.

'His stepdad, Nick Baldwin, is a builder and had been helping him a bit. Podgie was so proud of it. It looked marvellous and he had built it for his family.'

Paying tribute to his son, he said: 'You couldn't get enough of Podgie. He was just that type of person. Knowing how well-loved he was is helping us all.

'We were mates as well as father and 
son. He was also a great dad.

Mr Fenwick's family say they are pulling together to deal with tragedy, which happened on July 1

Noah ran up to his father shouting 'daddy, daddy' after the fatal fall, Mr Fenwick's father has said

He added: 'He was so giving. He was, what I would call
 'passionate angry' about things close to his heart. Podgie just wanted 
to help people.

'As a family, we are just pulling together and helping each other come to terms with what has happened. We take comfort from the fact that he died happy. He was so proud of the extension he had built.

'There is no wondering what happened, because we were there. That makes a big difference.'

Mr Fenwick's step-mother, Lorraine, added: 'Podgie was a real cheeky chappy. He would get away with anything when he gave you that smile of his.'

Mr Fenwick is also survived by his mother, Pam Baldwin, brothers Adam, 21, Luke, 27, Sean, 31, and sisters Lisa, 32, Marie, 32, and Sherrena, 34.
