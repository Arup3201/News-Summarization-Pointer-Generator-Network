Some buy jewellery, others perfume, but lovebirds who really want to show their affection for their partners this Christmas can snap up a stunning heart shaped island for their partner.

But although the two-and-a-half acre property in Canada's beautiful Laurentian Mountains, comes complete with a log cabin, beach front and small boat, at $983,676, it amazingly comes in at less than a million.

'What is a dream for most could become reality for you - complete privacy,' said a spokesperson for Vladi Private Islands which is listing Blueberry Island. It sits on Lac (Lake) de l'Achigan, around 45 minutes north of the bustling city of Montreal, in the French speaking Quebec region.

A foot fibreglass boat that comes with the property, nestles on the island's 125 foot beach. It is the only way of transporting people, equipment and supplies to the island  

Nestled among the trees is a 523 square foot open concept log cabin. Around one acre of the two-and-a-half acre island is cleared while the rest is covered with huge white pine, maple, hemlock and cedar trees

A 30-foot wharf is pushed out for boats to dock against. Blueberry Island sits in the Lac (Lake) de l'Achigan in Canada's Laurentian Mountains  

Nestled among the trees sits a 523 square foot open concept log cabin with hardwood floors and a fireplace for those freezing winter months. The new owner will also be able to warm up in their very own private sauna.

Also included in the listing is 30-foot float wharf and a 16-foot fibreglass fishing boat to bring people and supplies across to the island. .

'The island is naturally landscaped and has a lovely sandy beach, garden and forest,' said the Vladi Private Islands spokesperson. 'About one acre of the island is cleared and another one-and-a-half acres are forest with huge white pine, maple, hemlock and cedar trees. 

'Beautiful huge boulders are left by the glaciers and the island is great for forest walking, where one can find a sunny quiet spot at any time of the day.'

Although it is set in the rugged wilderness of the Canadian countryside, the new owner will have access to all mod cons, with power and telephone lines supplied by an underwater cable. 

The cottage also has a television satellite dish and internet access, according to the listing.
