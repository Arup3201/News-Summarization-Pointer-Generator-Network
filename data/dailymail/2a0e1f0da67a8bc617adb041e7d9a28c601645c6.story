Aaron Ramsey believes that Arsenal have their most settled side in years, and by doing their transfer business early are in a strong position to mount a serious title challenge this season.

The Gunners finally ended their nine-year long trophy drought by winning the FA Cup in May, and Ramsey insists that will be the start of a new era for the North London club.

The Welshman told the Evening Standard: 'This season the team are more settled going into the new campaign. We have had a few weeks together to get to know each other better and maybe that will help us when the season starts.

'Alexis Sanchez had a great World Cup with Chile and they are all fantastic signings. The new boys bring some more quality to the team and they have settled in really well.

'Every season prior to last season, the talk was about how Arsenal had not won anything. We have finally put an end to that and we really want to kick on and be successful for many years to come. We want to keep this momentum going.'

Ramsey, who scored in Sunday's 3-0 Community Shield win against Manchester City, was clear about Arsenal's aims for the forthcoming campaign: 'This season we want to challenge for the Premier League and the Champions League,' he said.

For Arsene Wenger's team to be able to compete at that level, Ramsey will need to recapture the scintillating form that saw him score 16 times for the Gunners last season.

The 23-year-old had a summer off during the World Cup and is in confident mood.

'Sometimes players are slow to get going after a World Cup but I have had a rest and am feeling good,' he said. 'Scoring the winner in the FA Cup final was a great way to end last season and watching the World Cup made me want to get back out there.

'There are still things for me to improve on and I am looking forward to doing that. Hopefully, I can hit the ground running, and so can the whole team.'

Arsenal begin their Premier League campaign against Crystal Palace at Emirates Stadium on Saturday.
