A cow has been causing chaos on Scotland’s busiest road during rush-hour this morning after charging on to the motorway. 

Traffic was at a standstill for more than an hour after the rogue animal managed to escape from a field and get onto the M8 motorway near Glasgow Airport.

Strathclyde Police were alerted to the incident at junction 29 of the Glasgow to Edinburgh route at around 8.30am.

Stand-off: The stubborn bovine refused to move along, and instead faced police head on

After a stand-off between officers and the offending cow, the farmer was eventually tracked down to round his animal up - but the beast was not for moving.

Queues on the westbound carriageway stretched several miles back to junction 27 Arkleston in Renfrewshire.

Several users took to social media site Twitter to write about the unusual site, including Lorraine Fraser who managed to take a picture of the roaming animal.

Despite the best efforts of its captors, the cow roamed on the road for more than an hour.

Glasgow Airport issued an official warning to holidaymakers via its Twitter page that the road was blocked.

Drivers caught up in the widespread traffic jams managed to see the funny side with one Twitter user labelling the incident as ‘udder pandemonium’.

Another person tweeted: 'Theres a cow on the M8 - I bet its causing udder mayhem. All the commuters will be milking it cos they’ll be late until someone moooooves it.'

St Mirren player Lee Mair got in on the act saying: 'I think the cow was trying to get to Moootherwell, Calfcart, Udderston or Barnhead!!'

He then added: 'The cow wasn't going to Castlemilk or Cowglen. He was on his way to the airport to get a flight to Moscow!!! #Cow #M8 '
