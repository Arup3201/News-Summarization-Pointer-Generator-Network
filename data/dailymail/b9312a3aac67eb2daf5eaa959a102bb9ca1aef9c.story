Quota call: European justice commissioner Viviane Reding

The EU will today unveil plans to force companies to put more women in their boardrooms.

European justice commissioner Viviane Reding will announce the first step toward legal targets for the minimum number of females in top jobs.

The attempt by Brussels to press for legal quotas on British businesses will prove highly controversial.

But, speaking ahead of the publication of her report, Miss Reding warned equality would take another 40 years without radical action.

She added that women were running out of patience at being kept from the top table.

But Conservative MEP Marina Yannakoudakis condemned the quota as patronising and said women had to get top jobs on merit alone.

'In the UK 100 women were appointed to FTSE-100 and FTSE-250 boards last year and FTSE-100 boards currently have 15.2% female representation,' she said.

'I agree that there is still a long way to go, but these women were selected because they were the best people for the job. Had they made it to the top by virtue of quotas it would have been nothing short of patronising.'

EU figures show that only 12 per cent of board members at large listed companies are women, well below the 40 per cent threshold targeted by Brussels.

Miss Reding said: ‘It’s no secret that in countries where there are legal quotas [for representation on boards], the figures have grown substantially.

‘In countries without obligatory quotas, progress is slow. I think we’re slowly running out of patience everywhere in Europe. I am not a fanatic about quotas ... but I like the results quotas bring out.’

The justice commissioner has previously called for voluntary targets of women making 30 per cent of board members by 2015, and 40 per cent by 2020. But her report is expected to reveal that progress has been slow in many EU countries.

A public consultation will now seek views on the level, timing and scope of quotas, and sanctions for failing to meet them.

Legislation proposed by Brussels requires the support of governments representing two thirds of the bloc’s population.

Last month, David Cameron refused to rule out the introduction of quotas if business leaders fail to meet Government demands for more females in top jobs.

The Prime Minister said the promotion of women into senior jobs needed to be accelerated and that the case was overwhelming. However, ministers have been reluctant to enforce legally binding targets.

Following a review by Lord Davies, the Government has instead set voluntary quotas for business leaders to more than double the number of women in boardrooms by 2015.

Ministers have said that firms should employ a minimum 25 per cent of women executives. But Mr Cameron has said that this figure should be 30 per cent.

Norman Lamb, Liberal Democrat coalition minister for employment relations, consumer and postal affairs, said: ‘We think getting more women on corporate board is important.

‘But for now, we do not support quotas, nor do we think it’s appropriate for Europe to seek to impose them.’

Business leaders have warned that compulsory quotas would backfire against women.

City superwoman Helena Morrissey, chief executive of Newton Investment Management, last month warned that women would not feel equal in boardrooms if their bosses were forced to put them there.

Women currently make up just 15 per cent of FTSE 100 directors. Mr Cameron has faced criticism for not appointing enough women. In the current cabinet, which has 23 members including the Prime Minister, there are just five women.

Lord Davies last night warned that legal quotas would be a mistake and would ‘raise the temperature’.

He told the Financial Times: ‘The reality is that we have insufficient number of women of the executive committees of all British listed companies.

‘That’s something that will take a bit longer to fix, but I think you have to fix the board and then get the CEOs to realise that this is quite an issue.’

Miss Reding, from Luxembourg, is the Brussels commissioner in charge of justice, fundamental rights and citizenship.
