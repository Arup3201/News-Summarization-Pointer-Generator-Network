Selfie super-fan Kim Kardashian well and truly put contouring - a laborious method of applying make-up to enhance features - on the map in 2014.

So popular did the technique become that hairdresser Charles Worthington introduced hair contouring in his salon and Marks & Spencer are getting set to unveil contouring tights in store next month.

And now, Playtex has jumped on the bandwagon by unveiling the first top cup contouring bra, which, they say, is a 'major innovation' for women wanting to rediscover their full breast potential.

Playtex has unveiled a new contouring bra, which promises to boost your assets, after discovering women want to emulate Holly Willoughby's

Makers of the £32 Contour Perfection bra say it's different - and innovative - because it features top cup padding.

The bra comes with thin foam cups, which promise to restore fullness in the upper cup of the breast by moulding to them.

This claims to help restore volume and shape to an area not usually considered in the padding of a bra.

This extra padding, which is dubbed a morphologic system, moulds to the breast to help create a fuller, rounder shape.

The new bra, which is available in sizes 32-42 B-E and 32-40 F, was launched on the back of research carried out by the brand, which revealed that half of women are unhappy with their assets.

The study found a third of unsatisfied women have a cup size C-D, despite two thirds believing this is the ‘ideal’ cup size.

The study suggests that changes to the breasts with age may be at the root of women’s discontent as  over half (58 per cent) said they’ve noticed significant changes to the shape of their breasts since turning 35. 

Changes concern more than six out of 10 women, with a staggering 88 per cent citing loss of fullness or increased sagginess as their main complaints. 

And when asked which celebrity’s assets they most admire for their fullness and rounded shape, nearly half of the women said Holly Willoughby, while only 2 per cent are in awe of Katie Price’s. 

Nigella Lawson also featured highly on the list of breasts most admired for their fullness and rounded shape, as did Kelly Brook and Katy Perry. 

A spokesperson for the brand said: 'The research findings prove there’s a real need amongst women for a bra that helps inject fullness back into their breasts, so we’re delighted to finally unveil Contour Perfection - a comfortable, stylish and truly transformative shape-perfecting bra that helps women restore natural fullness and a beautifully youthful shape.'
