Harry Redknapp has revealed that he hopes Jermain Defoe will sign for Queen Park Rangers in January after the west London club failed to acquire his signature this summer.

The QPR boss had hoped to lure Defoe away from Toronto FC, but was unable to seal a deal with the former West Ham, Portsmouth and Tottenham striker.

However, Redknapp remains confident that the 31-year-old will be a QPR player before the season is out.

On the move: Defoe was keen to join QPR and could sign in January, according to Redknapp

He told talkSPORT: 'There is every chance he will come in January. I'm a big fan of Jermain's. Almost certainly, I think we will [go back in for him].

'I've signed him so many times. I've taken him everywhere.'

QPR fans had to settle for deadline day deals for former Tottenham midfielder Sandro and Dynamo Kiev's Niko Kranjcar despite Redknapp's best efforts to sign Defoe.

He added: 'We tried all day with Jermain Defoe," he added.

'He was keen to come. We agreed a deal with Toronto but they wouldn't release him now.'
