As two of the world's most celebrated photographers, Bruce Weber and David Bailey have each had their fair share of challenging scenarios.

But a new project for Nokia presented one that neither had encountered before. Working with a smartphone - namely the new Lumia 1020 - instead of their usual cameras.

In a glimpse from behind the scenes on the shoot in Harlem, New York, earlier this summer, Mr Weber is seen using the new handset to capture Mr Bailey with two of the borough's locals.

By all accounts, the pair had a blast 
working with one another - despite the fact that it turned out to be one
of the hottest days of the year.

Not that the heat even caused Mr Bailey, 75, to break a sweat, he told MailOnline in an 
interview afterwards.

'There was this bunch of kids who opened up the fire hydrant - and guess
who was in it with all the kids? David!'

Dismissing our concern over the searing temperatures, he said: 'I've been in hotter places. . . Saudi Arabia, Afghanistan, India, Ethiopia - everywhere!

'It was memorable spending the day in 
Harlem with Bruce showing me around.'

Indeed, for Mr Weber, 67, revisiting Harlem was a trip down memory lane.

'I've
always loved it, it's always been my favorite place in New York City. . .' 
he said. 'I've just always enjoyed the people 
up there, the way they dress. I've gone to church up there a couple of 
times. . . I always have an amazing time.'

And those summer temperatures, he added, were actually more help than hindrance when it came to capturing the locals.

'I think the heat really brought a lot of people out, you know, in a different way,' he said. 'Some people were in bathing suits, some people were in big hats - it's kinda crazy!

'We
were on the way to this boxing gym and there was this bunch of kids who
opened up the fire hydrant - and guess who was in it with all the kids?
David. He was soaking wet, you know. . . I got soaking wet too! We 
weren't so worried about the cameras!'

Not
that Mr Bailey would have even worried much with his usual kit. 'The 
camera I use is pretty waterproof anyway - it should be for what it 
cost,' he added.

Using a smartphone to take pictures 
was not a foreign concept for Mr Bailey, who says that 'if it takes a 
picture, I'm going to use it.'

It was a first for Mr Weber though, who has never even shot in digital before.

Both failed to be enticed by the terminology and apps that dominate smartphone photography these days though. Neither was familiar with the term 'selfie', and while Mr Weber is familiar with Instagram, he is not tempted to use it himself.

'I don't know if I like the idea of sharing with a lot of people, you
know, not that I'm doing so many interesting things, but it seems weird
to me,' he says.

'I don't have 
anything against it, you know, if people like what they do - others in 
the studio do a lot of instagram and take beautiful pictures  - and 
sometimes they take pictures of themselves - it's kind of funny, I like 
to see how they see themselves.'

Both photographers, who have 'been mates for years and years', admitted they were 
impressed by the capabilities of the 41 megapixel smartphone, which 
claims to simplify the controls previously reserved for professionals.

'This
is the first time that I have used a mobile phone for my work, said Mr 
Weber, who shot in colour, despite the fact that black-and-white imagery
has defined his career.

'Nokia has created a smartphone which not only
matches the capabilities of many high-end cameras, but in most cases 
surpasses them. It simplifies creative photography.'

Mr Bailey, who shot to fame in the Sixties, shooting the world's most famous models for Vogue and will be celebrated by the National Portrait Gallery next summer in a major exhibition titled Bailey's Stardust, was equally impressed.

'The level of detail you can capture using a Nokia Lumia 1020 is
nothing short of breathtaking,' he added.

Between them, Mr Weber and Mr Bailey took over 1,000 photographs, 30 of which will be displayed in London between 13 and 21 September at the Nicholls & Clarke Building in Shoreditch.

More images from the shoot will feature in exhibitions set to take place in different destinations across the globe at later dates this year.
