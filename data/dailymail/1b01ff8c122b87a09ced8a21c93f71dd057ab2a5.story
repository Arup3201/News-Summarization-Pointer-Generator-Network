Momentum: The Bank of England hailed the rate of recovery as GDP grew by 1 per cent this year

The British economy is ‘building momentum’ and growing at the fastest rate for seven years, the Bank of England declared yesterday.

Gross domestic product - the total size of the economy - grew by 1 per cent in the first three months of 2014, according to the central bank.

And it expects growth ‘to be only a little weaker’ between April and June as the economic bounce turns into a full-blown recovery.

The last time the economy grew by around 1 per cent for two quarters in a row was in mid-2007 before the meltdown at Northern Rock.

In a further boost to George Osborne, official figures showed that Government borrowing has fallen to its lowest level since the financial crisis and recession struck.

There were also fresh signs that the economy is becoming more balanced, easing fears the recovery is too reliant on consumer spending and the housing market.

A survey by the CBI business lobby group showed confidence among British manufacturers is at its highest level since April 1973 and factory orders are growing at the fastest rate since 1995.

The motor industry is faring particularly well with car production up 12 per cent in March to 142,158, according to the Society of Motor Manufacturers and Traders.

Nearly 80 per cent of cars made in Britain are sold abroad making the industry a key driver of UK exports overseas.

Katja Hall, chief policy director at the CBI, said: ‘Confidence is rapidly rising among British manufacturers, with a real sense of business optimism. Our industrial base is seizing a bigger role in the UK’s economic recovery, with output, orders and hiring all on the up.

‘There are still bumps in the road ahead. However, expectations for growth in the coming three months are positive and manufacturers plan to significantly ramp up investment in the year ahead.’

Investment by business is seen as crucial to a sustainable recovery because it can lead to higher profits, increased productivity, more jobs and better wages.

The Bank of England welcomed signs that investment is starting to pick up.

‘The domestic recovery was building momentum, with some signs of a modest rebalancing towards investment,’ said the minutes of this month’s meeting of the monetary policy committee.

The news came as George Osborne learned Government borrowing is at its lowest level since the crisis

The Bank said ‘it was likely that productivity had started to rise after several years of stagnation’ and that wages are picking up - bringing an end to the squeeze on family finances.

‘It was possible that a sustainable rise in real wages and incomes, consistent with a durable recovery in demand and output, was in prospect,’ it said.

But the Bank warned that there was ‘considerable uncertainty’ about the outlook for the UK - suggesting it is in no hurry to raise interest rates from the current level of 0.5 per cent.

Speculation is mounting that rates will rise early next year - possibly before the General Election in May 2015.

But the Bank said that ‘even when the economy had returned to normal... the appropriate level of Bank Rate was likely to be materially below the 5 per cent level set on average prior to the financial crisis’.

The Bank, headed by Mark Carney, suggested there is no hurry to raise interest rates from 0.5 per cent

Figures from the Office for National Statistics suggested the economic recovery is feeding through into the public finances.

The Government borrowed £107.7billion last year - down from £115.1billion in 2012-13 and well below the record £157.3billion deficit racked up by Labour in 2009-10.

The annual deficit was worth 6.6 per cent of GDP last year - down from a peak of 11 per cent under Labour and the lowest level since 2007-08 before the crisis struck.

A Treasury spokesman said it provided ‘further evidence that the Government’s long term economic plan is working’ but added ‘the job is not yet done’.

Martin Beck senior economic adviser to the EY Item Club, said: ‘The public finances continue to show improvement. But there is still a long way to go in fixing the public finances. Austerity won’t be going away anytime soon.’
