The discovery of a 'hidden network of caves and bunkers' occupied by the Islamic State in northern Iraq, by an Australian military plane, has led to an enormous airstrike and the death of over 100 terrorist fighters.

Vice-Admiral David Johnston, the chief of joint operations at the Department of Defence, revealed details of the successful multi-national airstrike during an operational update in Canberra on Tuesday.

He said that an Australian F-18 Super Hornet military plane, fitted with regular and heat-seeking night cameras, located the concealed bunkers and tunnels in a hillside at Kirkuk while monitoring movements on the mountain during the last week.

'Within days a subsequent multi-national airstrike involving 20 aircraft attacked 44 targets, complimented by a large-scale ground operation that was led by the Kurdish security forces, that rapidly entered that area, cleared it of the remaining ISIL militants, and with some reporting indicating that over 100 ISIL fighters were killed in those clearance operations,' Vice-Admiral Johnston said.

Another recent airstrike that was led by an Australian crew led to the 'severe damage' of a major improvised explosive device factory in Mosul. 

Australian forces have also had an important role in the Iraqi government recapturing control of an oil refinery in Baji that, according to Vice-Admiral Johnston, has allowed them to better fund their own defences through the daily $13 million worth of revenue it produces.

Air strike operations and air-to-air refuelling operations were provided by Australian forces during this mission, which also destroyed at least seven targets after dropping more than 20 bombs.

Aside from the offensive operations, Australian Defence has dropped over 32 tonnes of food, water, tents, and blankets to Iraqi civilians throughout a number of humanitarian missions (pictured) in the last week

Weapons have also been delivered in the last 20 days.

During his address, Vice-Admiral Johnston said that generally, 'the advance of ISIL across Iraq has slowed' with locals starting to 'counter the influence of ISIL within their towns'.

'ISIL continues to reduce their profile to air attacks. Predictably, what we have seen is that ISIL is increasingly moving to conduct asymmetric attacks, specifically through the use of improvised explosive devices, and suicide bombers,' he said.

However, he said that Islamic State fighter groups were still on the offensive and launching significant attacks in some areas of Iraq where they hope to gain territory, such as Ramadi, just west of Baghdad.

Islamic State fighter numbers in Iraq are estimated to currently be in the thousands and  while a number of the group's leaders have been successfully attacked, 'they are able to regenerate leadership'

Vice-Admiral Johnston estimated that Islamic State fighter numbers are currently in the thousands and that while a number of the group's leaders have been successfully attacked, 'they are able to regenerate leadership'.

'But every time you lose a leader with experience, with knowledge of the area that they're operating in, that's been intimately involved in planning and preparing for operations. That has an impact on forces,' he said.

No indication of civilian casualties in Iraq were given, however the director of general air operations, Air Commodore Vincent Iervasi said 'it was highly unlikely that there were non-ISIL individuals involved or in the vicinity' of the attacks mentioned.
