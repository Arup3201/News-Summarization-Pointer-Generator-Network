They may be arch rivals on the pitch, but Mario Balotelli and Wayne Rooney have more in common than they'd like to admit.

Just days after it was claimed the wayward Manchester City striker had a fling with Rooney prostitute Jennifer Thompson - it's emerged he dated and even proposed to the Manchester United star's second cousin.

Glamour model Holly Henderson, who was spotted on a date with the 21-year-old back in November has come clean about their romance - and confessed she's related to Rooney.

Miss Henderson, 33, claims she met Balotelli in a nightclub last year and the pair enjoyed a string of dates.

She said: 'We went out a few times and he seemed fun. He told me he was single, so I didn't see a problem.

'It's all a bit odd. I am Wayne's second cousin though I don't know if Mario is aware of it.'

Their relationship got so heated, the footballer - nicknamed Super Mario - offered to marry her if she agreed to quit modelling.

'He said he would marry me if I gave up my career,' she told the Daily Star. 'He hated my modelling.'

Miss Henderson - who didn't fully explain her family connection to Rooney - said she began to have doubts about the relationship when Balotelli became controlling.

She claimed he even showed up on the set of Channel 4 reality show Come Dine With 
Me, because he was suspicious about her relationship with a male 
co-star.

She added: 'He would be constantly messaging me to find out where I was or asking me to meet him and if I didn't reply straight away he would send me angry faces.'

The fling ended for good when the pair were photographed together on a date in November. The photos appeared in the media, forcing Balotelli to admit he had a girlfriend, 23-year-old Raffaela Fico.

Miss Henderson insists they haven't spoken since.

Just two months later, Balotelli met and began a six-week-long affair with former escort Jennifer Thompson, who found notoriety in 2010 when she claimed to have had sex with Wayne Rooney while his wife Coleen was pregnant with their son Kai.

The Italy international was forced to admit the affair with Thompson when news leaked last week - his agent admitting the pair had a 'brief involvement'.

News of Balotelli's fling with Henderson will be another huge blow to Rafaella Fico, his longterm girlfriend.

Miss Fico has already had to suffer the humiliation of discovering Balotelli slept with Jennifer Thompson just two days before he declared his love for her infront of 47,000 fans during a game against Blackburn in February.

After scoring, Balotelli lifted his shirt to reveal a t-shirt bearing the slogan 'Raffaela Ti Amo', Italian for 'Raffaela I love you'.

And the revelations come just two days after he was photographed with yet another woman - a mystery blonde - in Manchester city centre.
