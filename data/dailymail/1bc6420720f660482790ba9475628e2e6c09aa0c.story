A couple from Texas that unsuccessfully tried to have children for five years were blessed with a set of twins - for the third time.

Mark and Kristi Riggs of Prosper recently welcomed Maxim and Slate into the world. 

The boys already have four siblings: Tatum, Lincoln, Titan and Steel.

Mark and Kristi Riggs of Prosper, Texas, were surprised to find out they were having twins Maxim and Slate (pictured). The couple already has two sets of twins

Kristi and Mark turned to in vitro fertilization after being told they would never be able to have children 

After having difficulty conceiving, Mark and Kristi turned to in vitro fertilization.

'We were told we couldn't get pregnant,' Kristi told NBC 5. 

After using IVF treatment, they were finally able to have their first set of twins, Tatum and Lincoln.

About five years later, they had Titan and Steel.

The gender ratio - five boys and one girl - is a little skewed, but Mark and Kristi couldn't be happier. 

A sample is taken from the couple and a series of embryos are made from the samples to make sure they are healthy.

Genetic markers in the embryo indicate whether the baby will be a boy or girl and, as a result, the desired sex will then be implanted into the mother.

The remaining embryos are then either frozen for future pregnancies, disposed of or donated to other parents, depending on the wishes of a couple

The process is popular in the US, with one in ten IVF cycles performed now being carried out for gender selection.

Kristi said: 'We know that as soon as they get older it will be a lot of fun to have all these kids close in age.' 

They do admit Maxim and Slate were a bit of a surprise. 

When Mark found out the newest set of twins, all he could say was 'Huh?'

Kristi had a similar response when a nurse told her everything was going to be okay.

She said: 'For who?

'All you have to do is deliver.

'I have to take home.'

There is at least one drawback to having so many little ones. 

'It's about $143 a month in diapers,' Kristi said.

A 2012 study found that some couples who previously used IVF to conceive were able to have a baby naturally after the treatment. 

Researchers found that in some cases the couple had a baby even after an unsuccessful experience with IVF.

'Most infertile couples think that they are unable to conceive spontaneously whereas our study shows (this) remains possible,' Dr. Pénélope Troude at the French national medical research institute, INSERM, told Reuters Health.

'Our results should give hope to couples who have been unsuccessfully treated by IVF,' Troude wrote in the study.
