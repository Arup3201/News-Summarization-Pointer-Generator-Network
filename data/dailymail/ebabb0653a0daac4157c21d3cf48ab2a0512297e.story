Anjem Choudary will not face police action despite saying he would like to see David Cameron and Barack Obama killed

A controversial Muslim cleric will not face action despite telling his followers to claim benefits and saying David Cameron should be killed.

Telling fellow fanatics to claim 'jihad seeker's allowance', Anjem Choudary, who in the past has planned to disrupt the minute's silence on Remembrance Sunday, also openly mocked hard-working Britons, calling them 'slaves'.

The Sun newspaper secretly filmed him saying Islam will overrun Europe, David Cameron and Barack Obama should be killed, and called the Queen 'ugly'.

The newspaper gave its evidence to the authorities, but Thames Valley Police today said: 'The material fell below an evidential threshold to pursue a criminal case against him.'

After the incident, Choudary said he had been 'joking' and his words had been misconstrued. He also maintained that Osama Bin Laden was his 'hero'.

The father-of-four takes home more than £25,000 a year in benefits and lives in a £320,000 house in Leytonstone, East London.

He told a crowd of around 30 fanatics: 'People will say, "Ah, but you are not working". But the normal situation is for you to take money from the kuffar (non-Muslim).

'So we take jihad seeker's allowance. You need to get support.'

In another video a grinning Choudary is recorded telling his disciples that it is justifiable to take money from non-believers.

He said: 'The normal situation is to take money from the kuffar. You work, give us the money, Allahu Akhbar (God is great). Hopefully there's no one from the DSS listening to this.'

In one section of the video Choudary said Barack Obama (left) and David Cameron (right) should be killed

He
 also called Mr Cameron, Mr Obama and the leaders of Pakistan and Egypt 
the 'shaitan', or devil, and said he wanted them to be killed.

Choudary
 spoke glowingly of the 9/11 attacks and urged his followers to have 
'hate' in their hearts for core British concepts like democracy, freedom
 and freedom of religion.

The 45-year-old former lawyer added: 'We are going to take England — the Muslims are coming. Brussels is 30 per cent, 40 per cent Muslim and Amsterdam. Bradford is 17 per cent Muslim.

'These people are like a tsunami going across Europe. And over here we're just relaxing, taking over Bradford brother. The reality is changing.'

On Monday, MailOnline reported that a 
mother was arrested for posting a comment on her Facebook page saying 
she would 'like to egg' David Cameron.

They spent four weeks trying to track her down, visited her old house and called an out-of-date mobile phone.

After all their inquiries, Kent police decided there was no threat.

Last year, a man had his conviction overturned after he joked about blowing up Robin Hood airport.

He  was told to pay £1,000 in fines 
and charges after being convicted in 2010 but a judge ruled that a joke 
could not by definition be menacing.

He was at the airport in January 2010 
when it was closed by snow. He tweeted: 'Robin Hood Airport is closed. 
You've got a week and a bit to get your s*** together otherwise I am 
blowing the airport sky high!!'

At another meeting he displayed a £10 note of the Queen and described the portrait as 'ugly'.

Choudary, 45, ran a group called al-Muhajiroun which held anti-Western demonstrations and is the former leader of Islam4UK. Both were outlawed in 2010 under the Terrorism Act.

He told the Sun that his reference to 'jihad seeker's allowance' was a joke and claims he has never urged his followers to kill anyone.

He said: 'Cameron is doing satanic actions but I am not asking for anyone to be killed. We want everyone to worship Islam.

'I invite Cameron and the Queen to worship Islam.That would be an ideal situation.'

His teachings were met with ridicule by some Muslims. Twitter user Razwan Faraz said: 'Islam teaches us to be independent and self sufficient.

'You clearly are a living dichotomy of ideas and actions!'

Choudary later said that his rant had been 'misconstrued' and said his jihad seeker's allowance' comment had been a mere joke.

He also maintained that he had been comparing economic and welfare systems between Islam and Britain in a talk, and discussing how Islam would provide 'basic needs' for its citizens, The Sun reported.

He said: 'As a joke in this talk to lighten the atmosphere I said "jihad seeker's allowance".'

He then said he believed terrorist and 9/11 mastermind Osama Bin Laden was a 'hero' to him and some of the Muslim world.

Choudary said: 'He sacrificed his life and wealth for what he believes.

'He stood up against the super powers of his time.'
