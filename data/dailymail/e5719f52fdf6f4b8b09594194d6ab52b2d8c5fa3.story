It may not be one of life’s great mysteries, but the lack of vast amounts of fossilised dinosaur faeces has baffled scientists for years.

However, Slovakian researchers believe the answer lies in the diet of cockroaches, which might have dined on dinosaur waste millions of years ago.

Using cutting-edge imaging methods, the scientists discovered particles of wood inside an ancient cockroach’s gut, which they think came from dinosaur faeces.

Researchers from the Slovak Academy of Sciences in Slovakia said that dinosaurs certainly must have produced a lot of faeces, and yet fossils of the waste are not very widely discovered.

‘Although appearing trivial, cockroaches, one of the dominant insect orders during the Mesozoic, were never examined as representing top candidates for partial processors of dinosaur dung,’ they wrote in their study, published in the journal PLOS ONE.

Ancient cockroaches from the extinct Blattulidae family lived alongside herbivore dinosaurs between 250 million and 65 million years ago, LiveScience reported.

The scientists used a technique called synchrotron X-ray microtomography to make a 3D model of a fossilised cockroach preserved in a chunk of 120-million-year-old amber discovered in Lebanon.

The cockroach in question died while it was going to the toilet, leaving behind a fossilised poo, called a coprolite that contains tiny pieces of wood.

As the wood particles had smooth edges, the researchers said the cockroach did not chew them and its digestive system was not able to digest wood.

The scientists therefore believe that the insect must have eaten the faeces of a herbivorous dinosaur.

Other fossilised species of the 
cockroaches have been discovered with undigested carbon in their guts, 
but it is only the specimen examined in the study that has been found to
 have indirectly eaten wood.

There were theories that dung beetles and flies might have munched on dinosaur waste but they were rare during the Mesozoic, the scientists said.
