According to our favourite style icons it's not what you spend, it's how you wear it that defines style.

And now cheap chic accessories brand Claire's Accessories has been given the ultimate style seal of approval by landing a spread in Miss Vogue, the magazine house's glossy new tome aimed at the most discerning tweenage fashionistas.

Once the epitome of naff the high street brand has begun to cultivate a rather fashionable following, and while there is still piles of brilliantly OTT tat to be had, the company is now able to count superstars like Rihanna as fans (the singer recently told Vogue that she gets all of her jewellery there).

Featuring model of the moment and MTV 
presenter Lilah Parsons the four page spread showcases the brand's 
designs for spring and summer, with an emphasis on cute festival fashion.

The Miss Vogue story comes just weeks after the brand announced a collaboration with global megastar Katy Perry, and days after Claire's threw a very chic Paris Fashion Week party complete with celebrity DJs Laure Whitmore and Bip Ling and wall-to-wall French bloggers.

Speaking at the party Londoner Lilah, 25, said: 'I love their stuff. It's fun and fashionable and it means that I can change my look every five minutes.

'Working with the Vogue styling team was amazing and the pictures are really pretty. This summer I'm going to be wearing lots of the round Sixties shades and piles of rings.'

The Sophia Grace & Rosie collection includes 10 very pink products

Not content with taking American TV by storm mini British rappers Sophia Grace Brownlee and Rosie McClelland are now aiming be tween beauty 'It' girls.

The 7-year and 10-year-old tutu-loving girls melted hearts when they first appeared on the Ellen DeGeneres Show performing Nicki Minaj's Super Bass song in 2011. Since then they have made regular appearances on the show as well as creating their own YouTube channel and signing a film deal.

And last week the pint-sized powerhouses launched a collection of Sophia Grace & Rosie products including lip gloss and lip balm to be sold exclusively at Claire's Boutiques.

According to WWD.com the Sophia Grave & Rosie line could be the first in years with the power to engage young girls and their mothers.

The line includes 10 styles of apparel,accessories and beauty products ranging in price from $6 (£3.50) for a hair bow to $16 (£9.50) for a sequined tutu. A five-piece lip gloss with purse is priced at $10 (£6).According to POPAI, the global organization for spending at retail, there are now nearly 21 million children 9 to 13 years old who wield a spending power of $43billion (£25billion).
