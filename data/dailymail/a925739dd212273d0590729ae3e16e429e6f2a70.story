'I promised Victoria lots of drinking and merry-making, so please do not behave yourselves tonight,' to which Victoria added: 'We have to have a lot to drink and dance a lot....Then maybe I’ll get back on the mic.'

And Victoria isn't the only Beckham rolling out fashion hits - her husband David's highly anticipated collection for Belstaff has just been unveiled.

This capsule collection follows the announcement of Beckham as the face of Belstaff’s 2014 global advertising campaign and opening of the brand’s London flagship on New Bond Street.

Speaking about his new range, the football hero said: 'About five or six years ago I was looking for a cool biker jacket. I went into this vintage store and came across this vintage Belstaff jacket. I have worn it ever since.'
