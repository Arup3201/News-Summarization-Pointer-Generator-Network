According to Andy Warhol everybody gets their 15 minutes of fame. But after 60 years on the throne and in the limelight, one person who has enjoyed far longer in the public eye is Queen Elizabeth.

And to mark the end of the monarch's Diamond Jubilee year, four of the famous pop artist's portraits of the long-serving sovereign have gone on display for the first time at Windsor Castle.

Bought by the Royal estate back in September, the iconic images have gone on display as part of The Queen: Portraits of a Monarch, a collection unveiled this week, with the exhibition running until next summer.

Warhol, who once said that he wanted to be 'as famous as the Queen of England' and who is famed for his images of a Campbells soup tin, Marilyn Monroe and Elizabeth Taylor, created the images in 1985.

Using an old portrait of the Queen from a decade earlier, Warhol created the colourful pictures in 1985.

Featuring bright block colours and sprinkled with diamond dust, the pictures each measure 39 inches by 31.5 inches.

The original picture had been taken by Peter Grugeon and was used prominently in the Queen's Silver Jubilee celebrations.

In the image, she is wearing the Vladimir tiara, Queen Victoria's Golden Jubilee necklace, Queen Alexandra's wedding earrings and King George VI's family order pinned to her garter sash.

Warhol created the images as part of his Reigning Queens collection which also featured Queen Beatrix of the Netherlands, Queen Margarethe of Denmark and Queen Ntombi Twola of Swaziland.

Born Andrew Warhola, the artist initially worked as a commercial artist for magazines and designed advertising and window displays.

He came to fame after he began to experiment with reproductions based on advertisements, newspaper headlines and other mass-produced images from American popular culture in the early 1960s.

He became internationally famous and exhibited his work all over the world in the 1970s and 1980s before he died suddenly following a gall bladder operation in 1987.

As well as Warhol's pictures, the exhibition features a range of different images of the Queen, some taken to mark state visits or anniversaries and others taken for use on coins, stamps and bank notes.

It also features works by the likes of Cecil Beaton, Pietro Annigoni and Lucian Freud.
