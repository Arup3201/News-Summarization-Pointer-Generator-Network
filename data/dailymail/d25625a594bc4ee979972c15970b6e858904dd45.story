Manchester City are the Premier League champions, Liverpool threw it away. Or so everyone would have us believe.

In fact, there are four-and-a-half hours of the title race still to run. And given what happened in the final 11 minutes at Selhurst Park on Monday night, that allows plenty of time for the plot to thicken.

Sportsmail brings you 10 reasons why the Premier League title race is not over

Champions? Manchester City are 1/14 favourites to win the Premier League

Thrown it away? Liverpool's title bid stuttered when they were held 3-3 at Crystal Palace

Manchester City – the champions elect, we are told – host Aston Villa on Wednesday before welcoming West Ham to the Etihad on Sunday, the same day Liverpool face Newcastle at Anfield.

Here, Sportsmail runs you through 10 reasons why the Premier League title race is far from over…

1)    They've done it once...

Aston Villa have already beaten Manchester City this season. Twice they were trailing at Villa Park – Yaya Toure and Edin Dzeko having scored either side of Karim El Ahmadi – but two goals inside three minutes courtesy of Leandro Bacuna and Andreas Weimann turned the game in the home side’s favour. They’ve done it once, no reason why they can’t do it again.

Salute: Andreas Weimann celebrates after scoring the winner for Aston Villa against Manchester City

2)    They've done it twice...

In fact, they’ve done it more than once. For Villa were 4-2 victors at the Etihad last season during the third round of the Capital One Cup. Gabby Agbonlahor scored twice on that occasion and, should he be passed fit, the forward will no doubt be buoyed by that man-of-the-match showing.

Gift of the Gab: Gabby Agbonlahor was on target when Villa won 4-2 at City in the Capital One Cup last season

3)    Daft lads might leave Reds laughing...

Gary Neville certainly thinks Villa have it within them to produce an upset. ‘Villa have some daft players, they could do something stupid in big games like score three goals on the counter attack,’ he said, burying a compliment somewhere in his observation. They have taken 10 points off the top four this season, more than any other team outside that upper echelon.

4)    Away the lads...

Villa are away. For when Paul Lambert’s men escape the expectation of their own back yard they are an altogether different proposition. On away form they would be 11th in the table, as opposed to the 17th they occupy in the home standings. They perform far better on the road and, with their Premier League safety guaranteed, the pressure has eased.

Away the lads: Villa have fared better on the road this season

5)    City stallers...

City entertained the division’s bottom side – Sunderland – last month and, were it not for a goalkeeping howler from Vito Mannone two minutes from time, they would have been beaten, Samir Nasri salvaging a 2-2 draw. They have it within them to stutter on home soil (remember Wigan in the FA Cup?) and, with both Villa and West Ham supposed walkovers, complacency may yet prove their undoing.

Held: Connor Wickham scored twice as Sunderland - then bottom of the league - emerged with a 2-2 draw from the Etihad

6)    There will be no power Serg...

Sergio Aguero is missing because of injury. Okay, Edin Dzeko is enjoying a rich run in front of goal, but Alvaro Negredo has not scored in the league since January and the absence of the Argentine could yet prove costly.

Blow: Sergio Aguero will be missing against Aston Villa because of injury

7)    There's time for a twist...

Liverpool were long odds-on shots to triumph in the title race last month following their victory at Norwich and City’s failure to beat Sunderland. If this season has shown us anything, however, it is that the certainties are just as easily turned over. Villa, for the record, are 20/1 shots to nick a win at Eastlands and we wouldn’t rule out another twist in the tale just yet. There are four-and-a-half hours still to play after all.

8)    Reds' opponents are out of Toon...

Liverpool have it relatively easy on the last day of the season, entertaining a Newcastle side who have lost their last four on the road without scoring a goal. A few early goals at Anfield - as has been the norm in recent months - could make for a nervy atmosphere at the Etihad were the score still tied.

Flying: Liverpool, and the likes of Philippe Coutinho (right), have been on fire at Anfield this season

9)     Can Manuel go the distance?

Despite managing in Europe for the best part of a decade – including a spell at Real Madrid - Manuel Pellegrini has never won a league title on this continent. Neither, of course, has Brendan Rodgers. But the pressure is on Pellegrini more than his opposite number on Merseyside - can he handle the strain?

Feeling the strain? Manuel Pellegrini has never won a league title in his 10 years managing in Europe

10)    Liverpool ARE top…

Liverpool, don’t forget, remain one point clear at the summit of the Premier League. And, until that changes, it would be foolish to declare this race run.
