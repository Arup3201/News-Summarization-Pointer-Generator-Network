Reunited: Angela Palmer went her whole life believing that her mother abandoned her at an orphanage when she was a child, but learned the other side of the story when her mother requested to be her friend on Facebook last month

Angela Palmer got the ultimate early Christmas gift this year when she reconnected with her mother on Facebook.

The 44-year-old California woman was born in Germany where she was raised by her father, Klaus Hostnik, who told her that her mother abandoned her as a child.

But Palmer learned the other side of the story when a woman named Helga Simecki from Croatia asked to be her friend on Facebook, a week before Thanksgiving.

Like most people, Palmer ignored the friend request at first, but then Simecki sent her a message she couldn't ignore.

'She said she was my mother. I was shocked because my mother had abandoned me when I was a baby,' Palmer told Yahoo Shine.

Palmer was suspicious at first, but was soon convinced when Simecki sent her daughter's birth certificate and pictures of her as a child, answering questions only her mother would know. 

That's when the two started a conversation that would lead Palmer to learn the truth about her upbringing.

For years, Palmer believed the story that her father told her: That when her mother gained full custody, she dropped her off at an orphanage.

'Later my father took me in, and although he was an alcoholic and mentally and physically abusive, he was the only parent I knew,' she said.

Confirmed: Simecki proved she was Palmer's mother with a birth certificate and several family photos like the one above

Simecki says she did get full custody, because Hostnik was physically abusive but that she never willingly gave up her daughter.

'One day, under the guise of taking me to a doctor appointment - because my mother couldn't afford it - he took me and never came back,' Palmer told The Stir.

Simecki told her daughter that he kidnapped her because his parents refused to financially support him unless he had custody of his daughter.

While Simecki tried to get her daughter back, she had a hard time tracking her ex-husband down since he moved so often. According to Palmer, she and her dad moved 12 times in 18 years.

'What he was telling us was he was a traveling salesman, so we would have to move from area to area to get new clients and so on,' Palmer told San Diego 6, 'when in all actuality he was wanted by the German government.'

First time: San Diego's News 6 set up a Skype meeting between mother and daughter, marking the first time they've seen each other face to face

Seeing her daughter: Simecki, calling from Croatia, was clearly choked up in the call. Palmer is currently fundraising to buy a ticket for her mom to visit the U.S.

While living with her father in Europe, Palmer had contact with her mother just once - on her sixteenth birthday.

'A family member said my aunt was on the phone so I picked up and it was my mom,' she rememebrs. 'She started to explain but I hung up on her, angry that she had abandoned me.'

Palmer soon left her father to go to attend school in North Carolina at age 18 and never went back. The last she heard, he died a few years ago.

Now knowing the true reason behind her mother's separation, Palmer is working on organizing a face to face meeting. She has set up a fundraising campaign on Fundly, hoping to get 4,000 dollars to bring her mother to the U.S. for a visit. As of Saturday evening, the campaign had raised 3,310 of the goal.

'There's so much catching up to do and so much that needs to be filled in. Until last Friday [Nov. 15], I had no family. Now I have a mother… a big extended family. I don't know how to explain it. It just makes for a nice holiday,' Palmer said.
