The stumps and the bails and their Zing lights glowed bright red in the Melbourne night as Glenn Maxwell’s throw smashed into the wickets, ran out Jimmy Anderson and ended a wretched mismatch between Australia and England.

Red for the shade of England’s embarrassment, red for the humiliation that stung the cheeks of their players as they fell to a crushing 111 run defeat to the co-hosts, red for St Valentine’s Day and the massacre that unfolded at the MCG on the first day of the Cricket World Cup.

England captain Eoin Morgan had put Australia into bat and then watched as they ran up a massive total of 342-9.

Nobody has ever scored that many runs against England in a World Cup before.

Even the Australians, in all the beatings they have handed out to us in one-day internationals, have never amassed a total that big.

We might not have been expecting an awful lot from England against the tournament favourites but, let’s be honest, we were expecting more than this.

This was a no-contest. It was a walkover. It was circus entertainment for the Aussies who crammed into this magnificent arena and got to guffaw at the ineptitude of the Poms.

There were times, sadly, when England were comically bad. 

Chris Woakes put down an easy catch offered up by Aaron Finch from the fifth ball of Australia’s innings. Finch went on to make 135. Moeen Ali missed a chance to catch David Warner. Jos Buttler dropped Maxwell.

Steven Finn claimed a hat-trick with the last three balls of the Australia innings but it was probably the most futile hat-trick in cricket history. Australia’s batsmen had taken the game away from England by then.

England’s ‘death bowling’ was poor again. They conceded 105 runs off the last 10 overs. And too many of their batsmen gave their wickets away too easily and too cheaply. That included captain Morgan, out for another duck.

By the end, the 84,000 fans at the MCG almost seemed to feel sorry for England. There was even applause for the gutsy James Taylor as he launched a one-man assault on the Australian total, a lone brave fighting overwhelming odds.

The umpires seemed to want to put England out of their misery, too. They ended the match by giving both Taylor and Anderson out off the same delivery, Taylor lbw and Anderson run out. It turned out both decisions were wrong.

Taylor, who was on 98, called for a review of the lbw decision and was reprieved. Replays then showed Maxwell’s throw had beaten Anderson but it was later agreed that the ball should have been dead as soon as the umpire raised his finger to dismiss Taylor.

The ICC got lucky. It wasn’t as if the match was close. It wasn’t as if the mistake affected the result, although it probably cost Taylor the century he deserved. But the game was already over. England were only trying to prolong a slow death.

Yes, the Australians played brilliantly. Finch produced a masterclass in power hitting, racing to a magnificent century on his World Cup debut. Steve Smith produced one of the best catches this ground has ever witnessed to claim the wicket of Buttler. The three Mitchells — Johnson, Marsh and Starc — bowled with hostility and precision.

But England made the victory an awful lot easier than it should have been. They made it feel like a capitulation, not just a defeat. ‘Here goes,’ former England skipper, Michael Vaughan, wrote on Twitter as England’s wickets started to fall. He posted a link to a picture. It was a white flag being run up a pole.

This may only have been England’s first match of this World Cup but even though they are still almost certain to qualify for the quarter-finals, it still felt like a desperately bleak performance.

It feels as though so much has been squandered in the past five years since Andrew Strauss and Alastair Cook led England to that emphatic Ashes triumph in Australia. So much has been lost. So much has been frittered away in the petty infighting over Kevin Pietersen which has drained the team of energy and talent and lingered as a reminder of the way we were.

Once, England seemed upwardly mobile and ready to step into the gap the great Australian side of Shane Warne, Glenn McGrath and Ricky Ponting had left behind. Those hopes are distant memories now.

England, particularly on the one-day stage, are a team who have fallen far, far behind. They were outplayed by the Australians in every department. They are a team shot through with confusion, indecision and uncertainty. All those faults were on view here yesterday.

It was a brutal illustration of just how wide is the chasm between these two cricketing nations at the moment. England are not closing the gap on their old enemy. The gap is getting wider.

There is no point pretending that Cook had made a strong case for retaining the limited overs captaincy before he was sacked last December but his removal appears to have made things even worse. There is an authority vacuum. There is a lack of coherence in decision-making.

So, for the first match of the tournament, when most teams are seeking to build on an established formula, England made changes. Ravi Bopara was dropped, Gary Ballance was brought in at No 3, Taylor was moved down the order to six.

Stuart Broad, not Woakes, opened the bowling with Anderson. They are not the most controversial decisions in themselves but they do not suggest an awful lot of joined-up thinking.

‘England really do make things difficult for themselves,’ Vaughan wrote later. ‘Change of batting line-up and team really does send a wrong message. Muddled thinking creates confusion.’

Quite how England regroup from here remains to be seen. They face an in-form New Zealand side in Wellington on Friday before travelling to Christchurch and the potential banana skin of a match against Scotland.

England’s heaviest World Cup defeat came against South Africa in 1999 when they lost by 122 runs. At least they dodged that record. In the search for positives from the humiliation at the MCG, that is about as good as it gets.

James Taylor did not know whether to blame bungling team-mates or bumbling umpires for being denied a maiden one-day international hundred at the MCG.

The batsman was stranded on 98 not out after running out of partners, though umpires Aleem Dar and Kumar Dharmasena must shoulder the blame for a farcical end to the match. 

Taylor was given out lbw but, even though his review was successful, the umpires decreed that James Anderson was dismissed via a run out in the same passage of play — when, in fact, a dead ball should have been called.

Chris Woakes was holding his head in shame after spilling Aussie opener Aaron Finch on 0 in the first over. Finch made Woakes and England pay with a devastating 135 off 128 deliveries to take the game beyond Eoin Morgan’s men.

Steven Finn added his name to the World Cup roll of honour after bagging a hat-trick — but they won’t go down as the best three wickets he has ever taken. Brad Haddin was first to go, holing out to deep third man, where Stuart Broad took a terrific catch. 

Joe Root’s catch to snare Glenn Maxwell was even better and Mitchell Johnson completed the hat-trick, picking out Anderson at mid-off as a sheepish-looking Finn celebrated only the eighth hat-trick in the history of the competition.
