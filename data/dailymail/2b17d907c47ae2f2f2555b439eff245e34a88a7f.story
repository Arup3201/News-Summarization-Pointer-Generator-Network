A Connecticut judge has blasted the 22-year-old Quinnipiac University student accused of calling in two bomb threats to her college's graduation ceremony and set her bail at $10,000.

Judge Philip A. Scarpellino said Danielle Shea caused panic for thousands for 'very, very selfish, minimal reasons' reasons.

Shea told police she didn't want her mother to find out she hadn't been attending class in the spring and would not be graduating - despite taking thousands of dollars from her family to pay for her education.

'I'm understanding that the whole year was a lie,' the furious judge told Shea, according to the Hartford Courant.

Authorities say Shea can't account for the money that her mother gave her.

When graduation arrived this weekend, Shea panicked when relatives didn't see her name on the graduation roster, they said.

According to police, Shea made two calls to the university's public safety department. In the first, about 20 minutes before the start of the 6 p.m. graduation ceremony, she stated there was a 'bomb in the library,' said police.

In the second call, about 20 minutes later, police said Shea warned 'Several bombs are on campus' and noted 'You haven't cleared out graduation. That's not a good idea.'  

The ceremony had to be moved from the main campus to TD Bank Arena because of the threats. However, graduation proceeded as normal - just 90 minutes late

Confession: Danielle Shea of Quincy, Massachusetts, admitted making the threats after being arrested at the indoor campus athletic arena, the TD Bank Sports Center, where commencement was taking place

Hamden and university police identified Shea using the telephone number she'd called from and then found her at the arena.

She was wearing her graduation cap and gown, which she had apparently bought to keep up the ruse with her family.

In court on Monday, she was still wearing a floral blue and white dress that she had on under her gown.

She has been charged with first degree threatening and falsely reporting an incident.

University spokesman John Morgan said 388 students were part of the commencement ceremony for the College of Arts and Sciences. It was delayed 90 minutes due to the threats.

Two earlier ceremonies were held at 9 a.m. and 2 p.m.
