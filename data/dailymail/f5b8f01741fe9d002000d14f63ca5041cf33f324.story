Police officers accused of stitching up former Cabinet minister Andrew Mitchell in the plebgate row yesterday refused to offer him an unreserved apology.

The two Police Federation officers had been dragged to the House of Commons to appear for the second time in front of the home affairs select committee.

But committee chairman Keith Vaz said he was disappointed that Detective Sergeant Stuart Hinton and Sergeant Chris Jones were not ‘unequivocal’ in saying sorry to Mr Mitchell.

Recall: Sergeant Chris Jones was accused of lying about his disciplinary record Detective Sergeant Stuart Hinton was called to Parliament to apologise for denying calling Home Secretary Theresa May 'that woman' 

The officers were warned that they could face proceedings for contempt of Parliament if they did not correct evidence given during their previous appearance last month, which MPs claimed had been shown to be false.

The two officers, along with Inspector Ken MacKaill, have been accused of attempting to discredit Mr Mitchell after meeting him in October last year.

They claimed the MP had failed to give a proper account of the ‘plebgate’ incident, but a secret recording made by Mr Mitchell showed he had offered an explanation.

Warning: Committee chairman Keith Vaz warned the officers that they risked being in contempt of Parliament if they failed to give straight answers

The recording also revealed that Det Sgt Stuart Hinton, of Warwickshire police, had referred to Home Secretary Theresa May disparagingly as ‘that woman’.

Mr Hinton apologised for originally telling the committee that he had made no such reference, saying it was an ‘inadvertent error’ and that he had not remembered using the phrase.

But the officers refused to show contrition over statements they made following their meeting with Mr Mitchell, which contributed to his forced resignation.

No apology: Chris Jones, Ken MacKaill and Stuart Hinton repeatedly refused to apologise to Andrew Mitchell despite admitting misleading the public about a meeting with him

Sgt Chris Jones, of West Midlands Police, was also challenged by MPs over his previous evidence that he had never been subject to disciplinary proceedings.

Yesterday, he confirmed that 13 complaints had been made about him, claiming that he had previously misunderstood the committee’s questions.

After the hearing, Mr Vaz said: ‘I’m disappointed they did not take the opportunity to we gave them to be unequivocal in their apology to Mr Mitchell and his family.’

A previous inquiry by the three forces resulted in no action. But Dame Anne Owers, the chairwoman of the Independent Police Complaints Commission, announced that two new inquiries have been launched into Mr Jones and Mr Hinton.

She told MPs the investigations into the officers’ conduct would be concluded by Christmas.

On October 12 last year Andrew Mitchell met three members of the Police Federation to discuss the 'Plebgate' case.

A tape recording of the reveals Mr Mitchell going to great lengths to explain what happened in Downing Street.

He
said: 'I did not say and I give you my word, I give you my word, I did 
not call an officer an f'ing pleb I did not say you are an f'ing moron 
and I did not say you should know your f'ing place.

'I would never speak to anyone like that least of all a police officer and you have my word I never said those things.'

Later
Detective Sergeant Stuart Hinton said to Mr Mitchell: 'I appreciate your candour, and we 
appreciate you have gone beyond what you said in, to the media.'

But
minutes later outside the meeting, Inspector Ken MacKaill, from West 
Mercia Police, accused Mr Mitchell of refusing to give any more detail 
of the incident.

Mr MacKaill said: 'I think Mr Mitchell has no option but to resign.

'He is continuing to refuse to elaborate on what happened. I think his position is untenable.'
