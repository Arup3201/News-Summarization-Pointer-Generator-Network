A pregnant teenager whose boyfriend was jailed for beating her wants his mother to adopt their unborn baby girl to stop social services taking it away.

Amy Dixon, 19, has already had her son put up for adoption by her local council and she fears she won't be able to keep her new daughter either.

Her partner Scott Webb, 23, is currently in prison for beating her up after they had a row about her ex-boyfriend.

As the young couple are in an abusive relationship it is expected that social services in Barrow, Cumbria, will take away Amy's second child when it is born next month.

Webb was jailed for 18 weeks by 
magistrates in Furness last month after admitting assaulting his 
heavily-pregnant girlfriend and being in possession of cannabis.

During
 their row, he accused Amy of cheating on him before dragging
 her into the house as she tried to escape from him.

The
 court issued the young thug with a restraining order to stop him 
contacting her - but despite the order they have vowed to 
continue with their relationship.

Amy, who suffered cuts to her arms during the attack, wants Webb to tackle his anger management problems, the court was told.

She has asked for her partner's mother, Wendy Webb, 43, to be given permission to look after her two-year-old son and unborn daughter who will be called Trinity.

The young woman said she is prepared for the courts to issue an injunction blocking her from seeing either of the youngsters.

She said she would rather the children were brought up by a blood relative than adopted by strangers.

However, social services at Cumbria County Council have ruled out her proposal.

Grandmother-of-two Miss Webb said she is fighting for custody of her two-year-old grandson and also wants to look after her unborn granddaughter.

Her grandson is set to be adopted, but Miss Webb said she cannot appeal because she cannot afford the Â£5,000 legal fees.

She claimed that she has been 'treated unfairly' because her son is a criminal.

She said: 'I feel that they haven't considered me as they should have and used the fact that my son is a criminal against me. I feel I have been treated unfairly - I don't have a criminal record.

'My grandson was taken into care because of the arguing between Amy and my son. We did ask for help when I went on holiday and I knew Amy was depressed but nothing was done.

'We had just returned when Amy rang me up totally distraught saying that social services were taking him.

'That was July 1 last year and he was put into foster care. From February 21 he will be able to be adopted if a family becomes available. I want to keep on fighting this but I just don't have the money. I am willing to move to Scotland to protect my grandchildren and I can't understand why they won't let me.

'If it's too late for my grandson I want to fight for my granddaughter. We've been warned it is likely she will go straight into care when she is born.

'We would rather she was placed with me and we can then work at keeping the family unit together if that's what it takes, or I can bring her up.

'Amy knows she has to distance herself from my son. He was her first love and it will be hard but she has to do it for the children.

'If I have my grandchildren here both of them have said they will stay away and are willing to have injunctions put on them. If they came near the house I would call the police. The only contact they would have would be through a contact centre.'

The family say social services intervened because of concerns the couple's abusive relationship was having an adverse effect on the child.

They plan to attend counselling when Miss Dixon's partner is released from jail.

However, as they will remain a couple it is likely their latest couple will be taken into care as well.

Miss Dixon said: 'I think it's all wrong. If I can't have my children I want Wendy to bring them up. It's heartbreaking losing your children but if they go to Wendy they will be staying with family.'

A Cumbria County Council spokesman said they were unable to discuss the case.

'With safety of children being paramount, the adoption process involves a range of procedures and guidelines that have to be followed to deliver the best outcome for the child,' he said.

'We do not comment on individual, ongoing cases concerning children and young people in care.'
