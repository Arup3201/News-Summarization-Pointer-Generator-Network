Nearly 70-years ago, they were laid in the sand to stop the Nazis invading from the west.

Now the tank traps built to protect Britain from Hitler's Panzer division have been uncovered on a beach after sand was washed away by the storms.

The metal structures, built using a mixture of heavy chains and disused railway track, were exposed on a beach in Porthcawl, South Wales.

Discovered: The tank traps were uncovered on rest Bay in Porthcrawl, South Wales in the aftermath of the storms that have swept the country

The traps, several feet high, were set in 1940 when the country feared that Britain might be invaded after Dunkirk.

They were part of a long coastal line of barricades to prevent enemy tanks from moving inland if they successfully reached the shores.

Porthcawl historian Keith Morgan, who remembers the tank defences from when he was a child, said they were still visible until 1946 or 1947.

He said: 'They were chains and old railway lines which were embedded upright in the beach. They would have been around six or seven feet above the level of the beach.

'I can remember them stretching from Swansea Bay all the way round to Porthcawl.

Tough: The historic fortifications are made of chains and old railway lines

Barricades: They formed part of an enormous line of coastal defences to prevent tanks from advancing inland

'They were then cut down at some point after the war but even then, I remember going swimming in Swansea Bay and catching my toe on them - it could be pretty painful.'

A number of tank defences were built in Wales, nine of which formed the backbone of the Western Command defence.

It was developed in 1940 and 11 of the barricades used rivers as their backbones.

Many were used to protect approaches by enemies into the North West from places such as the Arctic Circle and the Bay of Biscay.

However the main threat stemmed from the
 Republic of Ireland. Britain feared the country, which was neutral at 
the time, could provide a launching point for the German forces.

Those in South Wales were also used to guard against the flourishing mining communities which included the coal fields and industrial belt.

Concrete obstacles, which can still be seen today, were the main defensive lines set up on beaches. Anti-aircraft poles and wire obstacles were also used.

Around 30 beaches were said to have had the defences installed.

Council workmen will start digging them up and removing them this week after local beach walkers at Rest Bay complained they were a dangerous hazard.

Local Simon Tucker took photos of the remains of about a dozen traps and posted them on Facebook to warn surfers and other beach users.

He said yesterday: 'The council cut them back quite a few years ago but they are exposed now more than ever.

'They have been visible since the first storm back in January - it surprises me nothing's been done about it because they are so dangerous.'

A Bridgend council spokesperson said highways workers would be taking a digger to the beach to remove the traps.

Crews
 and machinery had been deployed elsewhere to tackle storm damage and 
the council had also been waiting for the sand on the beach to settle.

'About
 nine' World War Two explosives have been washed up on a beach in Essex 
following recent storms, Thames Coastguard have said.

They have been on the beach for nearly 70 years, but cause a problem for swimmers who can catch themselves on it

Line: The defences extended along the Welsh coast, all the way along to Merionenth Gwynedd in North Wales

Base: The defences were built eight miles away from RAF Stormy Down (picture during WWII) which was an armament training centre for the RAF

Engulfed: Enormous waves caused by the high winds hit Porthcrawl Lighthouse while storms battered British coast lines

Controlled explosions: 'About nine' World War Two explosives were washed up on a beach in Westcliff-on-Sea, Essex

Remains: Last week, 100 miles up the Welsh coast in Borth, an ancient forest thought to be 6,000 years old was uncovered by the storms

Experts from the Royal Navy carried out controlled explosions on the anti-aircraft shells at Westcliff-on-Sea at about 09:45 GMT.

They were called in by coastguards, after a man walking on the beach on Sunday morning spotted the explosives.

They were identified as anti-aircraft shells by the navy experts.

Thames Coastguard said the shells, which were corroded but still live, were found at low water at Ray Gut channel, about half a mile away from Westcliff seafront.

Lost: On Sunday, a shipping container from the Bay of Biscay carrying thousands of cigarettes washed up on a pebble beach in Seaton, Devon
