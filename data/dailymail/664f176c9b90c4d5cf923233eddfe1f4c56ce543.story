Police in Connecticut have arrested a 17-year-old who they say stole a 99-year-old woman's purse while she was delivering cookies to a local community center.

The elderly woman was walking outside the L.P. Wilson Community Center in Windsor at about 9am Wednesday when the teen snatched her purse from her and fled, police say.

Police say the suspect did not have a weapon and the victim, who was knocked to the ground, was not injured.

Scene: The elderly woman was walking outside the L.P. Wilson Community Center in Windsor at about 9 a.m. Wednesday when the teen snatched her purse from her and fled, police say

Police did not say how much money was in the purse.

'It was disappointing to see right before the holidays – obviously as you know – there’s laws and statutes that protect that segment of our population,' Sgt. Christopher McKee told FoxCT on Wednesday. 'I know a lot of folks were very upset about it when they heard what the offense was that had occurred.'

Senior citizen Terri Rousseau told the television affiliate station 'I would think [the community center] would be safe.'

Following the robbery, police looked for the suspect in the community center and also used a K9 team, The Hartford Courant reported.

The teen's name has not been released because of his age. 

He was charged Thursday with third-degree robbery, sixth-degree larceny and assault on an elderly person.

His case is being handled in Juvenile Court.

Capt. Kelvan Kearse told NBC Connecticut on Wednesday, 'This guy took advantage and made her a victim.'

Kearse also explained that 'Crimes of this type tend to escalate during the holiday season, unfortunately.'

Kearnes revealed before the teenager's arrest 'If he is the person we believe it to be, he does not live in town, but we are familiar with him.'
