A Virginia Republican Party official resigned Wednesday night over a post he made on Facebook questioning Muslims' contributions to the 'fabric' of America.

The post was a critique of President Barack Obama's statement that the Muslim holiday Eid-al-Fitr 'reminds us of the many achievements and contributions of Muslim 
Americans to building the very fabric of our nation and strengthening 
the core of our democracy. '

'It is one thing to be gracious on religous holidays, but this is 
pure nonsense,' Bob FitzSimmonds, the unelected Treasurer of the Republican Party of Virginia, said in a comment accompanying Obama's quote.

'Exactly what part of our nation's fabric was woven by 
Muslims? What about Sikhs, Animists, and Jainists?  Should we be 
thanking them too?' he asked.

Bob FitzSimmonds, Treasurer of the Virginia Republican Party, is resigning his position after inciting outrage among Republicans and Democrats alike last week when he questioned Muslims' contribution to the 'fabric' of America

FitzSimmonds remark was quickly repudiated by Republican activists and elected officials in Virginia, including Delegate David Ramadan, who comes from a Muslim family.

'The fabric of this great nation is built and continues to be woven on a daily basis by every loyal patriot American, whether they are Jews, Muslim, Christians or any religion,' Ramadan said, according to Virginia news website Inside Nova. 'This is the party of Lincoln. This is a party that represents everybody in the community regardless of their religion.'

'Medicine, business, finance, STEM to name but a few contributions to the nation's fabric. They should be recognized for the good works Muslims do,' a Virginia resident said in a comment on FitzSimmond's post two days later.

That's not the point, FitzSimmonds replied. 'Modern day Muslims are integral and important members of our society, but that is not really pertinent to my previous comment.

'Muslims were not around in the 1700's to "build the very fabric of our nation" as asserted by the President,' FitzSimmonds aruged.

'If he had opined that Christians "built the very fabric of Afghanistan or China" I would have been equally dismissive.'

Later that day, The Washington Post, which first brought the Republican Party official's controversial statement to light, claimed that two party officials said FitzSimmonds had resigned from his voluntary position with the party.

'This is news to
 me,' FitzSimmonds said on Facebook. 'Seems like I ought to know about this if it had happened.'

'I have no plans to resign now or in the future,' FitzSimmonds told a writer for conservative Virginia blog, The Bull Elephant.

This is the third time in the the last two years FitzSimmonds has publicly come under scrutiny for comments he made on Facebook.

Two weeks after President Barack Obama won reelection in 2012 the Republican said: 'When Obama is 90 years old and he dies and goes to Hell, he is going to say "This is all Bush's fault" '

'My Facebook post was not about Obama going to Hell. It was about his obsession with blame shifting and I don't really see anything inappropriate about it,' FitzSimmonds said in an e-mail to the Virginian-Pilot at the time.

Earlier this year FitzSimmonds accidentally called a female representative from the state a t**t.

After someone said said on Facebook that the women should vote for Barbara Comstock, a Republican Delegate who is running for Congress in Northern Virginia, FitzSimmonds wrote: 'I have nothing against Barbara Comstock, but I hate sexist t**t.'

Soon after he deleted the comment, and posted apology. In yet another email to the Virginian-Pilot explaining himself, FitzSimmonds said he meant to say 'twaddle.'

'Also to be clear, my post was not about Barbara  
Comstock.  It was relating to the sexist stereotypes being used by the  
woman posting,' he said.

FitzSimmonds said in his resignation letter he was not sorry for what he said because it was 'historically accurate'

FitzSimmonds, who is also a deputy chief deputy clerk of a county court in Virginia, tried to do damage control on his recent statements on Tuesday by meeting with the Muslim Association of Virginia, but the one on one did not have the intended effect.

'On this subject matter, we all have different opinions and in his mind, [FitzSimmonds] didn’t think [what he wrote] was offensive, and of course it was offensive to us, and not only to us but also to people throughout the state of Virginia,' association member Rafiuddin Ahmed, told Inside Nova. 'Even elected officials thought it was offensive.'

Ahmed told Inside Nova that the Muslim association wants FitzSimmonds to resign from his $82,000 a year job with the Virginia government because they are concerned he is unable to act impartially.

'A lot of people are concerned because … they are part of jury selection,' Ahmed said. 'So if someone is in a position where they are in court, they are worried about whether they will truly get a jury of their peers.

FitzSimmonds has not quit his day job yet, but he succumbed to pressure to on Wednesday night to step down from his position in Republican Party leadership.

In a letter to members of the GOP's state central committee, FitzSimmonds said that were his comment 'not causing grief for others, I would not mind.'

But because it is causing problems for the state party, FitzSimmonds said he would resign as soon as the committee votes on a successor.

'It seems that no matter how careful I 
might be, I will periodically give occasion for others to portray the 
party in a bad light, so long as I am a party official,' he wrote. 'After discussion
 with several party leaders it seems clear that I will either need to 
stop posting on social media or step down from my party office.'

Fitzsimmonds chose the latter, saying he was not 'constitutionally suited to sit quietly on the sidelines.'

He apologized in the letter for bringing unwanted attention to the RPV, but refused to retract his offending statement.

'It is historically accurate, was a valid criticism of the President’s revisionist history, and not a statement on Muslim involvement in modern day America,' he said.

Young Republican Federation of Virginia Chair John Scott, one of the Virginia leaders calling for FitzSimmonds to resign,' told MailOnline in an email this afternoon he was 'pleased' to hear about the outgoing Treasurer's decision to vacate his position.

'I look forward to putting 
these repeated distractions behind us and refocusing on what we should 
be working towards--electing Republicans,' he said.
