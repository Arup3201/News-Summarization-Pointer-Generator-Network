If you're looking for the perfect escape from busy city life there may be no better option than buying your own private island.

If you have the cash to spare, Duvillaun Beg Island off the coast of Ireland's County Mayo is going up for public auction with a reserve price of £80,000.

It could be the perfect location with its panoramic views of the Irish coast and the Atlantic Ocean, and plenty of peace and quiet, but there just one snag. And it’s quite a big one – it doesn't have a house.

Duvillaun Beg Island, accessible only by boat,  is going up for auction with a reserve price of £80,000

Duvillaun Beg Island, also known as Little Black Island, is located off the coast of County Mayo

The island is classified as an agricultural zone and the eventual buyer will have to get planning permission from the county council should they decide to build a property on it.

Listed with property auctioneers Allsop Space, the 22.6-hectare island is only accessible by boat and lies within a cluster of islands known as Duvillaun. 

The atoll is approximately 1.5 miles from the mainland Gaeltacht town of Belmullet (population: 1,000) and is located on the Wild Atlantic Way tourist trail, which stretches across the 1,553 miles of Ireland’s West coast.

Amenities on the mainland include Carne Golf Links, voted one of the best golf courses in Ireland, and plenty of of bars and restaurants. 

Duvillaun Beg Island: A piece of land with panoramic views and plenty of peace and quiet

According to Jonathan Fenn, from Allsop Space, Beg Island was last inhabited in the late 19th century. 

‘It was used for grazing sheep and cattle,’ he told MailOnline, ‘but right now is just a piece of land with panoramic views.

‘The eventual owner will have to check with the local council if they wanted to build a jetty or property on it.’

The island goes under the hammer on 16 September.
