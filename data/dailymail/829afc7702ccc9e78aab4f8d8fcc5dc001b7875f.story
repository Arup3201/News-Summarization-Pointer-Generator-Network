Chedwyn Evans, a 25-year-old rapist, emerged from the gates of Wymott Prison two hours before dawn. He climbed into a silver Mercedes 4x4 and raced away through the slumbering Lancashire streets.

And with his release, English professional football was confronted by the kind of crisis which will test both its basic competence and its moral authority.

Now most football ‘crises’ are little more than frivolous fodder for the back pages: this young footballer complains of feeling ‘tired’, that team loses three games in a row, this insufferable manager announces that referees are in malevolent conspiracy against him. Tales full of sound and fury, signifying nothing.

But this one is different. This one will ask important questions of a kind that the sport may struggle to answer.

The facts are widely known. In 2011, Evans, a footballer with Sheffield United, raped an inebriated 19-year-old woman in a hotel room in North Wales.

He was tried, convicted and sentenced to five years’ imprison-ment. He was refused leave to appeal. In the words of the Lord Chief Justice Lord Judge: ‘We can see no possible basis which would justify us interfering with the verdict of the jury, which heard all the evidence and reflected on it after careful summing up by the judge’.

Shortly after the trial, the victim’s identity was revealed by the trolls of social media. As a result of the subsequent abuse, she was forced to adopt a new identity and leave her home town.

Evans was released on Friday, halfway through his sentence and a storm came crashing around his head. Almost 150,000 people had signed a petition, appealing to the Sheffield United chairman Kevin McCabe not to reinstate him as a player. To accede to the appeal would require strong nerve and firm principle, since they once paid £3million for Evans’ services.

Gordon Taylor, chief executive of the Professional Footballers’ Association, argued that Evans has served his sentence and should therefore be allowed to return to his work.

The temperature was significantly raised by Judy Finnigan, a daytime television performer, who prattled: ‘He didn’t cause any bodily harm to the person... and she had far too much to drink. It was reprehensible, but he has served his time.’

She later apologised for her dimly offensive outburst but not before she had been swatted by Vera Baird, the Northumbria police and crime commissioner, who said: ‘He raped her — that is a serious injury. If you get drunk and someone steals your wallet, does this mean it’s any less of a theft than if you were sober?’

Such is the story so far and football’s dilemma is taking shape. There are powerful arguments on both sides. Should Sheffield United, who were apparently paying Evans at the rate of £20,000 a week for the first part of his sentence, cut their ties and send him packing? Or should they opt for mercy and redemption and restore him to a team for whom he has scored 48 goals in 113 matches?

In truth, we would have more confidence in a reasoned, equitable conclusion if the game’s record in these matters were not so dubious. Recall, for instance, that sleazy furore of last May, when Richard Scudamore — chief executive of the Premier League and therefore the most powerful man in the sport — was shown to have sent a series of crude, sexist emails. You will recall his mocking of ‘female irrationality’, the juvenile smut of his story of a former girlfriend, whom he called ‘double decker’, for reasons which he leeringly explained. 

There was also his tasteful re-telling of a ‘male fairy-tale’ about a prince who was proposed to, said no, then lived happily ever after and ‘banged skinny big-titted broads’.

The Premier League launched a rigorous inquiry, conducted by one of Scudamore’s bosom chums, then declared that their leader, who keeps their money rolling in, was not remotely sexist.

His subsequent apology took some time. The first self-justifying diatribe contained not a smidgeon of sincerity, while the second was almost as weak. No matter. Football was satisfied. Move on, nothing to see here.

Then, just last week, the garrulous Rio Ferdinand was charged with misconduct by the FA after responding to a Twitter follower who taunted that QPR needed a decent centre-half. ‘Get ya mum in’, said Ferdinand. ‘Plays the field well son! #sket’. 

A dictionary search revealed that “sket” is a Caribbean term for a whore. Some might wonder about the sinister mind that comes up with such a slur. I doubt that Ferdinand is much given to introspection.

This, then, is the climate in which Sheffield United must make their decision: brash, jokey, heavy on blokeish ‘banter’, devoid of saving sensitivity. Overt racism is thankfully unacceptable, but sexism, the ‘she-must-have-asked-for-it’ culture, is alive and well and thriving unchecked in English football.

I have no idea how Kevin McCabe and his board will decide the Ched Evans issue. I hope they will not be swayed by that petition, since such talent-show tactics are not the way important questions should be settled. Equally, I hope that the earnest but ill-judged efforts of the player’s friends will not prove decisive. In any event, we should not envy McCabe’s predicament.

Somebody observed this week that football is the victim in all this. They were quite wrong. For the victim is a 19-year-old woman who had taken too much to drink. And found herself in the wrong place, at the wrong time, with the wrong person.

P.S.

In a week dominated by the release of Ched Evans and football’s disturbing views on violence towards women, one voice was strangely silent.

Helen Grant, who is rumoured to be Minister for Sport, might have been expected to lead this particular debate. And yet she had nothing to say. She never has.

The sport ministry, devoid of funds, influence and power is scorned by ambitious politicians. But even its most inept occupants have, on occasion, found the nerve to make a point and state a case. Not Ms Grant. She just keeps her head down and waits for the moment to pass.

It is surely time she was put out of her misery. Be sure she would go quietly.

Manchester City owner Sheik Mansour

City fulfil their Eastern promise

The footballers of Manchester City have moved into a new home.

To nobody’s surprise, it is almost unimaginably lavish: the Etihad Campus has 16 pitches, an artificial pitch, a 7,000-seater stadium, as well as a training and medical block and a sixth-form college. The wider development, also backed by the owners of the club, involves a £1billion boost in 6,000 homes and shops in a neglected part of the city. No club has ever known such resources, but then, none has enjoyed the energetic backing of Sheik Mansour and his colleagues.

There are those who suggest that such largesse is deceptive, that it is part of a plan to make the Sheik’s of Abu Dhabi more acceptable to the wider world. And, given Abu Dhabi’s human rights record, they may have a point.

But the fact is that they are making a difference to the wider community as well as their fortuitously chosen football club. No other owner has made a remotely comparable impact upon his local area; not Abramovich at Chelsea, nor the Glazers at United, and certainly not that popular fellow who owns Newcastle.

There are many reasons to regret the influx of foreign owners into the Premier League. But the massively improved condition of East Manchester is not among them.
