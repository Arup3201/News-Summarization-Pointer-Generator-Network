Findus tycoon Lyndon Lea is a horse lover and accomplished polo player. Indeed when the multi-millionaire, 44, was asked last year which was his favourite personal pony, he named not one but seven.

In America – where he has a £25million beach home and a ranch in Santa Barbara – he said his top mounts were ‘Sweet and Low, Toro, Happy Trap, Mexicana and Antoinette’ thanks to their ‘speed, lateral ability and good temperaments’.

In England – where the Lancashire-born playboy has luxury homes in both Kensington and Berkshire – he named Molly, who ‘can do two amazing chukkas and never miss a game’, and Salsa, who ‘may have been my best ever, but she retired after we won the Gold Cup’.

Rider in a storm: Keen polo player Findus boss Lyndon Lea noted that the price of raw materials for Findus products was rising dramatically. Whether a desire to cut costs led to the horse meat fiasco is yet to be determined

The former Goldman Sachs employee, the son of a British engineer and hairdresser, founded his own hugely successful and aggressive private equity company, Lion Capital.

After successes with Weetabix – which he bought and sold on to the Chinese at a massive profit – Jimmy Choo shoes, Kettle Chips and Wagamama, he was hoping the frozen food industry would make him a mint too. Only last year he was claiming that frozen foods could transform their image, and head upmarket. But at the same time he also noted that the price of ‘raw materials’ for Findus products had been rising dramatically.

Whether a desire to cut costs led to the horse meat fiasco is yet to be determined.

Lea divorced wife Christina some years ago, and has two children, Zachary, seven, and Chiara, nine.

His polo team, Zacara, is named after the youngsters – as he funds it and plays alongside the professionals.

Personally embarrassing though the horsemeat fiasco is, Lea may ride the storm. 

He previously offered support to the boss of another investment, the American Apparel clothing company, despite its founder Dov Charney becoming embroiled in lewd harassment allegations.

Since his divorce, Lea has found time to throw lavish parties; one bash at his £25million mansion had sushi being served off the bodies of near naked women.

Apparently keen to rub shoulders with fellow wealthy horse-lovers, Lyndon Lea has enjoyed polo parties also attended by film stars Sienna Miller and Tommy Lee Jones – although he claims to be anxious to play down his ‘playboy’ reputation.

Broken rules: By selling horsemeat in lasagne, Findus seems to have broken Lea's 'golden rule in business' - 'You get on chance at life; don't lose it through deception or dishonesty'

Perhaps attempting to suggest how down to earth he is, despite his wealth, he told last year how he celebrated winning polo’s prestigious Gold Cup with a pizza and ‘a special bottle of wine’.

That special bottle of wine was a 1995 Chateau Haut-Brion – which retails at £250 a pop. And we can probably assume it was not accompanying a Findus pizza.

But Lea is not usually one for relaxing. He once claimed he worked at such a frenetic pace he needs three personal assistants to keep up with him.

He will be particularly galled that by selling horsemeat in lasagne, Findus, in which his private equity firm has a one third holding, seems to have broken his ‘golden rule in business’ – ‘You get one chance at life; don’t lose it through deception or dishonesty to others or to yourself.’
