They are the dark horses for World Cup glory, a country that is blessed with strength in depth and will pose a threat to all.

So deep is the talent in Belgium’s 23-man party that it has prompted Roberto Martinez, Everton’s studious manager, to go as far as saying they have the best all-round squad of the 32 nations that have travelled to Brazil this summer.

Having limbered up for the World Cup with three comfortable victories against Luxembourg, Sweden and Tunisia, it would take a brave man to bet against the Group H favourites but Kevin Mirallas insists Belgium’s best days will be in front of them, regardless of what happens over the next month.

If conquering the world proves beyond Marc Wilmots’ progressive squad, dominating the continent is firmly on the agenda. The European Championships, which will be staged in France two years from now, and Mirallas has warned that is when Belgium will be at their peak.

‘Everyone is thinking that we are going to have an absolutely magical experience in Brazil and for us as players it is going to be special but we remain very focused on our goal,’ said Mirallas, who will provide stealth from the flank when Belgium begin their campaign against Algeria in Belo Horizonte.

‘The one thing we can definitely say is that we will be stronger for Euro 2016. We will be better for this experience of the World Cup. But there is a huge amount of expectation on us for Brazil and with that comes pressure.

‘We lost two recent friendlies at home  after we had qualified for the World Cup (0-2 v Columbia, 2-3 v Japan) and received loads of criticism afterwards. That doesn't sit well with you. We will be better for the World Cup experience though and we’ll be stronger again for the European Championships.’

There is a reason so much is expected of Belgium. The collective value of their squad would run beyond £200million and many of their key figures, such as Eden Hazard, Adnan Januzaj, Vincent Kompany and Romelu Lukaku, have been thriving in the Barclays Premier League. Wilmots has such faith in a pool dubbed ‘The Golden Generation’ he recently extended his contract until 2018.

With expectation, however, comes pressure and Mirallas believes a lack of tournament experience could prove crucial – this is the first time Belgium have played at a World Cup since underwhelming in 2002 and only veteran defender Daniel van Buyten remains from that squad.

‘A lot of the talk back home is that we've got an easy group and we'll easily progress but we are keeping our feet very much on the ground,’ said Mirallas, who is now fully fit after missing the end of Everton’s season because of a groin problem.

‘All we are concentrating on at the moment is getting out of the group because it won't be easy. You have to consider we are a young group and only van Buyten has played in a World Cup.  You have to be honest and say that experience is important in these tournaments. We can't get carried away.’
