Tourists heading to the Vatican who like a tipple will be in good company.

Comparing the popularity of wine and beer around the world in 2013, the Comparecamp.com graphic reveals overall, drinkers prefer hops to grapes, with 187bn litres of the brew being drunk versus wine's 24bn litres - or two bottles of beer per one glass of wine.

Andorra came second in the list of the biggest wine drinkers, followed by France, St Pierre & Miquelon and Slovenia - with the US appearing in 56th place.

And while it may seem as though its the Brits who love a pint, the study reveals the Czech Republic is world's biggest beer consumer, with 235 litres of beer drunk per person every year.

Austria, Germany, Estonia and Poland make up the top five - with the US in 14th place. 

The US came out on top as the world's number one wine market, followed by France, Italy, Germany and the UK. 

Barleywine comes out as the most drunk beer in the world at 15 per cent, followed by stout (10 per cent), and India Pale Ale (seven per cent). 

The best-selling wines in the world, based on the amount of cases sold, are Barefoot (17 million), Gallo (15 million) and Concha y Toro (13.8 million). 

The research also revealed that the the most expensive wine sold - a bottle of Screaming Eagle Cabernet 1992 - fetched nearly £32,000 ($50,000) at the Napa Valley Wine Auction in 2000.

Expensive beer on the other hand won't break the bank at the relatively reasonable price of £1,128 ($1,815) for a bottle of The Antarctic Nail Ale.
