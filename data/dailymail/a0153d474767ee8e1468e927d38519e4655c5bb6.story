The BBC is under investigation after a worker at the famous Elstree Studios fell 30ft from a ceiling.

He had to be rushed to hospital after being found seriously injured on the floor. It is understood the man, said to be in his mid-30s, was working alone when the incident took place.

He was rushed from the independently run studios in Borehamwood, Herfordshire, to St Mary's Hospital in Paddington, London, for specialist treatment on his 'multiple injuries'.

The Health and Safety Executive is now investigating how the drama unfolded.

Elstree Studios is home to some of the biggest shows on British television, including the BBC's Strictly Come Dancing,  The Voice, Never Mind The Buzzcocks and Celebrity Juice.

The site is also known as the birthplace of Star Wars and has also played host to films including Indiana Jones, The King's Speech and new release Paddington.

The incident took place three weeks ago, on November 18. Emergency services were unable to say what the man's current condition was but he was understood to have been severely injured in the fall.

The BBC refused to comment when any questions were put to them about the incident.

Instead, in a statement they said: 'Our thoughts are with the individual and his family, friends and colleagues working on the site. The circumstances of the incident are currently under investigation.'

The spokesman refused to confirm or deny whether the man had been working alone and at height when he fell.

Hertfordshire police said they were called to the site in Shenley Road at around 10.40pm on November 18 following reports of a man being injured.

A Hertfordshire Police spokesman said: 'It appears the man, who is in his mid-30s and was working at the studios, may have fallen from a significant height.

'An ambulance was called to the scene and the man was taken to hospital in a serious condition.

'The Health and Safety Executive were notified. Police are not currently treating the incident as suspicious.'

The East of England Ambulance Service sent two rapid response vehicles, one ambulance crew and a doctor in a car to the scene.

The HSE said it was aware of an incident and was making inquiries.

A spokesman said: 'The issue for us is whether correct health and safety procedure was followed or not followed.'

Elstree Studios declined to go into details on the incident, with a spokesman saying: 'You would need to speak to the BBC. It is being investigated.'
