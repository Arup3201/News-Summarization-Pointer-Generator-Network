Silence: Many of Jimmy Savile's victims did not speak out because they thought they wouldn't be believed

Many victims of Jimmy Savile were ignored or even laughed at when they told friends and relatives they had been sexually abused, a report revealed today.

Some were told they were 'lucky someone like Savile had paid them attention', according to findings compiled by the NSPCC.

And other victims - some aged as young as eight at the time of the DJ's 'sickening crimes' - never told anyone about their suffering because they assumed they would never be believed.

Many of the 26 men and women interviewed for the report have still not confided in family or friends about their experiences, the charity said.

One victim said: 'Everyone found it hilarious so I eventually just stopped talking about it.'

Savile's crimes came to light in a TV documentary broadcast a year after he died in October 2011, at the age of 84.

The revelations about the former presenter of Top Of The Pops and Jim'll Fix It prompted hundreds of victims to come forward with claims that they were attacked.

According to today's report, Would They Actually Have Believed Me?, some of the victims told hospital workers and one went to the police, but no action was ever taken.

The 26 victims - chosen because they were the only ones willing to participate in the NSPCC's focus groups - were mostly children at the time of the abuse, and ranged in age between eight and 26.

The NSPCC said the research, which was commissioned by Her Majesty's Inspectorate of Constabulary in a bid to improve the way that police deal with abuse allegations, highlighted the 'devastating scars' that victims had suffered.

Some turned to drink and drugs to cope, while others have suffered mental illness or contemplated suicide.

Peter Watt, the NSPCC's director of national services, said: 'The responses these victims received when they first revealed Savile's sickening crimes makes heart-rending reading.

'They were ignored, dismissed, not believed, laughed at and, astonishingly, told in some cases they should feel lucky he had paid them attention.

'Half a century on, the world finally discovered just how dreadful his crimes were - something these men and women had known all that time but felt powerless to do anything about.

'The anger, frustration and sheer helplessness of the situation obviously damaged their lives in various ways. But they showed true courage in coming forward once more to talk about their experiences and hopefully they can now start to put the terrible trauma behind them.'

Abuse: Savile used his fame and reputation to attack children with impunity, a report has found

A report released last year found that a total of 450 people had claimed that they were abused by Savile, with three quarters of the alleged victims being children.

Many of his attacks were carried out on BBC premises as he was presenting TV and radio programmes, with others taking place in schools or hospitals while he was supposedly carrying out charitable activities.

Today's new report reveals how victims are able to recall precise details about the abuse, such as Savile's scent or the last words he said to them.

Some are still suffering from the emotional trauma caused by the abuse - when Savile's sex crimes became public knowledge at the end of 2012, some victims suffered flashbacks and felt physically sick when they saw pictures of him.

However, the extensive media coverage also encouraged them to come forward and report the crimes, the NSPCC said.

Three-quarters of victims interviewed did not realise as children that they had been sexually abused by the late DJ, the report found.

Some of those interviewed said they were aware that something wrong was happening but felt helpless, ashamed or intimidated by Savile's fame, with some believing the abuse had to be reported by an adult.

'I never thought I could go to the police on my own,' one victim said. 'Children's minds work completely differently, don't they?'

Power: Some victims were told they were 'lucky' to be chosen by such a big star as Savile

Some said they had initially blamed themselves, assuming they must have done something wrong, or 'been naughty'.

During
 the 1960s and 1970s, many did not understand what had happened to them -
 the issue of sex abuse was so hidden from mainstream society that the 
victims had never even heard the word 'paedophile'.

The
 report said: 'Some remembered feeling that an elder - particularly a 
celebrity like Jimmy Savile - must know better than they did.

'There
 were also cases where participants also remembered feeling conflicted, 
and wondering if they should feel flattered or grateful that he had 
"chosen them".'

A key reason for not reporting the abuse was an 'overwhelming belief' from victims that they would not have been believed at the time, the NSPCC said.

'Jimmy Savile was a powerful and influential adult, who was seen as a "charitable, good guy" raising a lot of money for charity,' the report said.

'This led to feelings of hopelessness and inferiority in his victims, who felt there was no way that their word would have been believed over his.'

Honoured: Savile was knighted in 1990 and received a host of other honours in his lifetime

According to the report, victims had 'largely positive experiences' when they finally went to the police after Scotland Yard launched Operation Yewtree in the wake of the TV expos√© about Savile.

But they wanted to see improvements, including new ways to report sexual abuse and additional specialist training for officers investigating allegations.

And one complained that when reporting the crime to police an officer said, 'I think I would have pushed him off,' leading to the victim once again feeling uncertain about exactly what had happened.

Lawyer Liz Dux of Slater & Gordon, who represents more than 140 Savile victims, said: 'We welcome the NSPCC's report into the disgusting and horrific crimes of Jimmy Savile which many of the victims we represent helped produce.

'It is hugely significant that the victims unanimously call for professionals who work with children and the vulnerable to have an obligation to report abuse they become aware of. It is frankly shocking this is not already law.

'Mandatory reporting of abuse, as recommended in this NSPCC report, would ensure the silence that Savile and predators like him shrouded themselves in will never be allowed to happen again.'

Drusilla Sharpling of HMIC said: 'I am deeply grateful to the victims who contributed to this powerful and moving report. It vividly portrays the pain and anguish suffered by Savile's victims, which was often made worse by the way they were treated.

'We owe it to them to make sure that the police service responds positively and ensures victims are supported, listened to and treated with compassion.'

Crime Prevention Minister Norman Baker said: 'It is encouraging to hear 
that these victims felt the response from police was largely supportive.

'While
 we can never right the horrific wrongs committed against these people, 
we must ensure we do all we can to protect the most vulnerable in our 
society from becoming victims again in the future.'
