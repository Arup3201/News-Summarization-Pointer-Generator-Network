The boos around Villa Park at the end were an evocative echo of the despair. Aston Villa have played eight hours and 42 minutes of Barclays Premier League football and failed to score. It's hard not to sympathise with their supporters. Football without goals ultimately becomes meaningless.

And though the attempt by some fans to demonstrate their discontent by boycotting the first eight minutes of the game had fallen flat, a more spontaneous protest – that of missing the last eight minutes of the match when the game was up - was much better supported, a steady stream of fans heading for the exits.

Those that stayed chanted: 'We want Lerner out' in reference to the owner, Randy. But he has put the club up for sale and there is no queue forming along the Trinity Road to buy so Villa must continue as they are, seemingly always fighting relegation. At Villa Park, it's always winter and never Christmas.

How the Premier League table now looks

Here's how Borini scored his opening goal... CLICK HERE for all the stats and more!

'It's been like that for three years, four years, five years, the same,' said Paul Lambert of another season immersed in the mire of relegation worries. 'There's no rest bite whatsoever. You meet it head on. You keep going. Come the end of the season you make sure you're out if it.'

That said, Lambert objected when it was suggested that might be the best Villa can expect. 'Absolutely no way,' he said. 'A club of this size should not be in the position it is. It's got to get up there. Certainly nobody likes it at the club. I don't like it, the chairman doesn't like it, the chief executive doesn't like it, the players don't like it, the fans don't like it.'

Putting it right is a harder task. Amidst the depression though, there was a team rediscovering itself. Not Villa of course; it's hard to fathom what they stand for at present. Liverpool though are quietly rebuilding a little of swagger of last season.

They are of course a long way from those heights at present. Perhaps the return of Daniel Sturridge will nudge them a little further in that direction. But at times they give glimpses of the free-spirited side that captivated the nation last season. It's now eight games undefeated since they lost to Manchester United, the game in which Brendan Rodger's completely changed to a back three.

'We re-gained our identity in how the team has played for two years,' said Rodgers. 'It was fair to say that the opening four months or so of the season we were just nowhere near what we had been so we needed to find a solution to that. Even though we lost the Man United game I saw enough in the dynamic of the team to know that could be a way forward for us.'

                       MINS PLD    KM       MILES 

Aston Villa                          107.7       66.9

Fabian Delph        90          10.9         6.8

Carlos Sanchez    90          10.9         6.7

Alan Hutton           90          10.5        6.5

Liverpool                             109.8      68.2

Jordan Henderson 90         11.3        7.0

Philippe Coutinho   90         11.1       6.9

Lazar Markovic       90         10.8       6.7

So much so, that Liverpool have begun to eye the top four again. 'If we can get through to the end of January and be somewhere near then, as we showed last year, we can put a run together which can see us in there. It's still the objective. It's a real young exciting team and you see that in some of the football we played today.'

You could. It was there in Alberto Moreno's marauding runs, Philippe Coutinho's sublime passing and Jordan Henderson's determined leadership. Perhaps more importantly it was there in the performances of Mamado Sakho and Emre Can and the much-maligned Simon Mignolet, 'outstanding' according to Rogders and indeed responsible for crucial saves when Liverpool looked to be squandering chances. Get the defence right and Liverpool could be dangerous.

For their opening goal on 24 minutes had the panache associated with Liverpool of late. Lazar Markovic exchanged passes with Sterling after a throw-in and fed Jordan Henderson. A neat touch and a lovely cross followed before Fabio Borini literally launched himself, body and legs flying through the air, to divert it in. 

It should have been 2-0 on 38 minutes when Lucas Leiva header put Sterling through on goal. With just Brad Guzan to beat and with a firm striker needed, he opted for an elaborate chip, only to see the ball land tamely into Guzan's hands.

There were some positives for Villa, even amidst the gloom. The performance was some way better than the defeat at Leicester last weekend. There was the arrival of Carles Gil on the hour ' as good a debut as I've seen' according to Lambert - who, along with Andi Weimann, injected purpose into Villa's offesnive play.

At least the team aspired to a goal. Benteke came closest in that second half period, feeding off a headed Baker flick-on to unleash a ferocious shot which Mignolet blocked well. The Liverpool keeper was then straight up to punch away a Weimann shot. Encouraged and emboldened, the Holte End roared its support and Baker went close on 67 minutes, heading over from a corner.

'I thought we were excellent in the second half, we were relentless and the goalkeeper has had a half,' said Lambert. 'The goals will come.'

Yet,ultimately it would not prove enough. There is still not enough attacking intent from Villa in long enough periods and Liverpool simply kept prodding and eventually they did get the goal they had long threatened.

It came when Sterling played in substitute Lambert, who controlled the ball and draggedit back it one delightful movement which landed Aly Cissokho on his backside. Lambert then matched the build-up with a high-quality finish, striking the ball into the far corner beyond Guzan. The clock showed 80 minutes and at the stage the Holte End did begin to empty.
