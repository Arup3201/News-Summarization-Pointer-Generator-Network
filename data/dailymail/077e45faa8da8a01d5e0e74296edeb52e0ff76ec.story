England hooker Dylan Hartley has turned down a big-money move to Montpellier and signed a three-year contract extension with Northampton.

Second row Courtney Lawes is also close to agreeing a new deal with the East Midlands club, who are planning a grand announcement to sweeten the news that fan favourite Samu Manoa is leaving for France at the end of the season.

Hartley, 28, had been tipped to move to the Top 14 after next year’s World Cup but Sportsmail can reveal he has already agreed to extend his nine-year stay at Franklin’s Gardens.

The club are still negotiating deals with fly-half Stephen Myler and centre George Pisi, but the club captain’s decision could convince them both to stay.

French media reported earlier this season that Hartley had been to visit Montpellier’s training facilities as he presided over a move that would have closed the curtains on his international career. 

The RFU and England management have a strong stance that they do not select overseas-based players, such as Steffon Armitage who plays for Toulon.

But the forward will now be available for selection beyond 2015 and England head coach Stuart Lancaster will be hoping that, as expected, Lawes decides to follow suit.

Hartley made his England debut in 2008, when Brian Smith was attack coach. Smith is now in charge of London Irish and the 48-year-old is understood to be considering a return to Australia when his three-year contract expires at the end of the season.
