A planned £20 million film about Formula 1 legend Sir Jackie Stewart has been vetoed by his wife over scenes claiming she had an affair with another driver.

Ewan McGregor had been tipped to play Sir Jackie in the Hollywood blockbuster, made by the couple’s friend William Pohlad, the director of Brokeback Mountain. It has been three years in development.

The script focused on the close relationship between the Stewarts and Frenchman Francois Cevert – who died during a Formula 1 qualifying race in New York in 1973.

Helen Stewart, centre, said a movie about husband Sir Jackie Stewart, right, has been shelved because filmmakers wanted to a plot line where she had an affair with the couple's close friend Francois Cevert

Lady Stewart refused to allow the affair plotline as it is not true but admitted it was 'probably the most exciting part of the film'

Lady Helen Stewart told The Mail on Sunday: ‘It was going to be a big film – but they wanted to say that I’d had an affair with Francois Cevert... and I wouldn’t let them do it, because it wasn’t true.’

Lady Stewart, now 65, admitted the affair ‘was probably the most exciting part of the film – if it was true. But it wasn’t. Francois was a great friend of Jackie’s and of mine but they wanted to make something of it – which was crazy.

‘Francois was described as the most exciting man in France at that time. We had great fun with him, he loved the children, he loved everyone that we were with, he had a great girlfriend.

'But Jackie and I are childhood sweethearts and we have been happily married for 50 years.  

‘I met Jackie when we were 16 and we got married when I was 21. We have two children together and nine grandchildren.

‘Anyway they’re not making the film. 
That’s the sole reason it’s scrapped – which seems a bit stupid to me 
seeing as it’s not true in the first place.’

Last night a spokesman for Pohlad 
declined to comment, but a source close to the film insisted that it was
 still in development and Pohlad and Sir Jackie were still  in 
discussions.

The Oscar-nominated director was inspired to bring the story to the big screen after seeing how the couple were affected by the death of Cevert, whom Stewart mentored and saw as his successor on the Tyrrell team.

Sir Jackie, 74, retired from racing after the crash that killed his friend.

The two men had been so close that Cevert regularly stayed with the Stewarts at their home in Switzerland and it was said the couple treated him like a son.

Last year Sir Jackie talked excitedly 
about the film as a chance to pay  tribute to his protege. In an 
interview, he said: ‘The film is about Helen and me and Francois, three 
people going through an experience in life. It will be a Hollywood film.

‘We are involved in that I have read the
 various scripts that have come through with Helen. We want accuracy, of
 course, but there has to be entertainment as well.

‘It is not going to be a hardcore racing film. It is going to be a human story from 1970, when Francois came into the team, until he sadly died.’

If the film is scrapped, it leaves the path clear for a second production, Weekend Of A Champion, a documentary about the Grand Prix circuit in the early 1970s directed by Roman Polanski.

It was shot as Sir Jackie prepared for the 1971 Grand Prix in Monaco and was first screened in 1972.

But a re-edited and remastered version, comparing one of  the sport’s most  dangerous eras to the present day, premiered at  the Cannes  Film Festival last month.

At the event, Sir Jackie recalled: ‘In those days, if you raced for five years, there was a two out of three chance you were going to die.’
