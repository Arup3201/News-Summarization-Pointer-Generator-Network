A romantic man has gifted the love of his life 55,000 dresses over their 56 year marriage.

Paul Brockmann, 78, wanted wife Margot, 76, to have a different dress every time they went ballroom dancing. And his relentless desire to deck her out in a beautiful frock led to him buying dozens of gowns a week over the decades.

But following a bout of ill-health and expensive storage costs - the dresses took up six full storage containers - the couple from L.A. are now selling off the impressive collection.

Belle of the ball: Paul bought wife Margot a new dress every time they went dancing

German-born, Paul, a general contractor, started dancing at the age of 13 and has enjoyed the pastime ever since. But he became as obsessed by the beautiful dresses worn by the female dancers as he did by the dance moves.

He met Margot at a dance and said she 'changed his life' after they fell in love.

He writes on his website: 'Margot is the love of my life and has remained so to this very day. I followed her to the United States and was disowned by my own family for doing so back in the 50's.

'We first lived in the Midwest and with time travelled West and settled in Los Angeles, California. The dress collection grew as I searched far and wide at estate sales, department stores, yard sales and antique shows. Always looking to buy more dresses for Margot, everywhere and anywhere I went.'

Paul explains how his love for Margot resulted in the huge vintage dress collection that's now on sale via their website.

He said: 'I loved seeing her dance and began collecting dresses for her. I would envisage Margot dancing in the dress, the look of it, the sound of it, and buy dress after dress for her to wear when we danced.'

The 55,000 dresses were bought across the decades - sometimes as many as 30 at a time - but it was always the 50s styles that Paul likes best. 

'I was fascinated by the dresses from
the 50s. The petticoats and the wide skirts made a woman look real 
feminine. And that is what I really liked. When I seen a gal with a 
dress like that,' Paul tells LA Weekly. 'I wanted to get her on the dance floor.'

'[Margot and I] went ballroom dancing every week, and I wanted her to have a different dress for every dance.'

But Paul's fascination with the dresses went far beyond him just buying them for Margot to wear once a week.

He bought a total of 55,000 - many of which his wife has never even worn.

Paul told LA Weekly he would buy the 
dresses 'before work, after work, sometimes during work' raiding 
department stores and yard sales so he would sometimes come home with 30
dresses in one day.

Spoilt for choice: Paul wanted his wife to have a different dress for every dance. He loves how they make a woman look

The most he ever spent on a dress was $300 (nearly £200) and he would buy them regardless of size - meaning they often didn't fit his wife.

He explained: 'If there was a dress that I liked, I could visualise what she would look like in it. And I had to have it. Even if it was the wrong size.

'You know, it's a crazy idea, but I kept thinking maybe my wife grows into them, whether losing weight or gaining.'

Two children, five decades of marriage and 55,000 dresses later, they have reached a point where they want to sell off their astounding collection. But not entirely.

'I do have some of my favourites that aren't for sale,' he tells HuffPost UK Lifestyle. 'From the very first one I bought my wife to the one that makes the perfect swoosh sound.'

'At the time of purchasing the dresses I really had no idea about designer names, but I am discovering dresses that date back to the 1940s from designers such as Oscar de La Renta and Vera Wang.'
