Dustin Hoffman has described how dressing as a woman for 1982 film Tootsie made him realize he is 'brainwashed' about the typical notion of female beauty.

In a 2012 interview that has resurfaced this week, the 75-year-old said that the movie opened his eyes to the unrealistically high expectations placed on women's physical appearance.

Mr Hoffman told the American Film Institute that transforming into a woman who was not conventionally attractive made him realize he had spent a lifetime judging women by their looks.

Emotional: In a 2012 interview that has resurfaced this week, Dustin Hoffman chokes back tears as he opens up about feeling 'brainwashed' about the typical notion of female beauty

Epiphany: The 75-year-old said dressing as a woman in 1982 film Tootsie opened his eyes to the unrealistically high expectations placed on women's physical appearance

'I went home and started crying,' he recounted, explaining that he told his wife that he knew then that he had to make this movie.

When she asked why, he responded: 
'Because I think I am an interesting woman when I look at myself on 
screen. And I know that if I met myself at a party, I would never talk 
to that character,' he confessed.

'Because she doesn't fulfill physically the demands that we're brought up to think women have to have in order to ask them out.'

'There's too many interesting women I have not had the experience to know because I have been brainwashed'

The actor then choked back tears as he recounted the realization that he had at that time.

'There's too many interesting women I have. . . not had the experience to know in this life because I have been brainwashed,' he says he told his wife.

The father-of-six, who has been 
married to his attorney wife Lisa for 32 years, said that he asked to do
a make-up test before signing onto the film, because he wanted to make 
sure he could make for a convincing woman.

Unconventional beauty: The actor tears up as he says he took the role (right) 'because she doesn't fulfill physically the demands that we're brought up to think women have to have in order to ask them out'

Tragic undertones: In the interview, the actor's voice trembles as he says that because of his epiphany, the lighthearted movie was 'never a comedy for me'

When Columbia Pictures transformed him into the role, he confessed that he was 'shocked' to see that he wasn't more attractive.

'I said "Now you have me looking like a 
woman, now make me beautiful,"' he recounts in the interview.

'I thought if I was going to be a woman, I would want to be as beautiful as possible'

'I thought
I should be beautiful if I was going to be a woman, I would want to be 
as beautiful as possible.'

When the make-up artists told him they couldn't make him any more conventionally attractive than they already had, that's when the actor had his epiphany.

His voice trembles as he says that for that reason, the lighthearted movie was 'never a comedy for me'.

Mr Hoffman was nominated for an Oscar for Best Actor for his role in the film.
