A grieving widow is suing a GP for £1.25million because she believes he misdiagnosed her husband's deadly cancer as piles.

Christopher Goodhead, died aged just 41 in January 2009, four years after the examination by Dr Asim Islam, who performed the exam on his first day in the job.

His devastated widow Melissa Cutting claims Dr Islam's allegedly inadequate 
examination caused a fatal 'delay in diagnosis' of her husband's 
condition until 2007.

Family: The 41-year-old also left behind four sons who were aged between five and 11 when he passed away

Furious Mrs Cutting, who has been left to look after her four sons, who were aged between five and 11 at the time, heard the news of his rectal cancer in 2007 - just weeks after Mr Goodhead had completd the London Marathon.

The IT expert, originally from Burton-on-Trent, Staffordshire, had visited the doctor two years earlier at The Stanstead Surgery, in Essex, near his new home in Suffolk.

Lawyers for his widow told London's High Court Dr Islam, on his first day in the job, carried out nothing more than a 'simple visual examination' and failed to thoroughly investigate the problems.

Dr Islam denies any responsibility for the death, and his legal team insist Mr Goodhead 'would have died in any event' even with specialist treatment from 2005.

Robert Seabrook QC, representing Mrs Cutting, told the court Mr Goodhead had left the surgery believing he had nothing worse than piles.

He said: 'He left the surgery believing that his diagnosis was certain, non-serious, and that no further medical input was necessary.

'Had he been advised to return for review - or if symptoms continued - he would have done so.

'It
 is our case that, with competent assessment and treatment in April 
2005, a diagnosis of cancer would have been made in May 2005.

'He would have been successfully treated and would have lived, or would at least have had an increased length of time to live.

Treatment: Mr Goodhead received the horrifying news that he was suffering from stage four cancer in June 2007. He began chemotherapy, but it was not enough to prevent the cancer spreading through his body

Missed: His tribute page also said he 'adored his family and was a wonderful husband and father'

'The defence case is that, even with earlier diagnosis and treatment, he would still have died on exactly the same day - or not significantly later.'

Mr Goodhead and his wife received the horrifying news that he was suffering from stage four cancer in June 2007.

Soon he began to undergo chemotherapy - but it was not enough to prevent the virulent cancer spreading through his body.

He died at home less than two years later in January 2009 but Mr Seabrook argued that given his 'gritty' character and "exceptional" fitness he would have stood a chance of beating the disease if given longer.

Claire Toogood, representing Dr Islam, told the court it would have been 'ludicrous' for her client to diagnose cancer from the symptoms he was presented with.

Case: Lawyers for hi Mrs Cutting told London's High Court Dr Islam, on his first day in the job, carried out nothing more than a 'simple visual examination' and failed to thoroughly investigate the problems

She said: 'It would have been ludicrous for a GP to have worried Mr Goodhead that he had cancer in circumstances where there were absolutely no pointers towards it.'

On a memorial site dedicated to her late husband Mrs Cutting described Christopher as 'an amazing man with a very big heart. He adored his family and was a wonderful husband and father.'

Compensation in the case has been agreed at £1,250,000 if the widow can prove he would have 'survived and lived' but for the alleged negligence.

Judge Dame Frances Patterson QC has reserved her judgement on the claim until a later date.
