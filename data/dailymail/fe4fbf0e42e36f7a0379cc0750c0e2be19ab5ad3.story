Just to confirm, for those of you who aren't totally sure, there was football before the Premier League. 

It may not have had the profile, the air time and the money the modern game has afforded it, but the old Division One still managed to create characters. And one of those was 75 years old in the week. 

From the mid-eighties until the Premiership was founded in 1992, Jimmy Greaves was football's crossover personality. 

As one half of Saint and Greavsie, he in fact became so famous that on a couple of occasions, when he couldn't do their ITV show, he was replaced by his own spitting image puppet. 

Comedian and West Ham fan Russell Brand tweeted this picture of himself and Ian Wright giving Paul Gascoigne a kiss after the trio appeared on BT Sport's Matchday Live with Fletch and Sav on Sunday

The year 1992 may have been the beginning of the end of Jimmy as a telly force, but it also happened to be the year that Channel 4 decided that Italian football had enough 'showbiz' about it to bring in a new audience. 

And with their Gazzetta show, it was an opportunity for the modern game to develop its first true TV personality. 

With the help of those series, Paul Gascoigne pretty much became bigger than football. Of course, from thereon in, life had occasion to get too big for Gazza. And his profile would often rise as a result, but for all the wrong reasons. 

But on Sunday morning, and at Greaves' old stamping ground, White Hart Lane became memory lane as BT Sport's Matchday Live With Fletch & Sav essentially became a platform for the Paul Gascoigne express. And Gazza was calling at all stations! 

Jimmy Greaves (here with England cricket legend Ian Botham during a 1985 charity walk) was football's crossover personality from the mid-eighties until the Premiership was founded in 1992

Brand became very much the fans' voice in the room when he told Gazza 'the greatness is still in you'

Sporting a magnificently eccentric grey paint brush of a beard, and with his hair slicked back, the first thought was that he was looking well. 

Then when he answered Darren Fletcher's question as to what he thought of the career we had just seen in highlight form with just one word, 'Doddle', the next thought was, this should be fun. And the great news is, it was. 

To begin with, he talked with real love about his present surroundings and pointed at the part of the stadium where he once tried to help ground staff get rid of some unruly birds. 

'I fell through the roof, 30 foot down', he laughed. 

When he explained to Terry Venables how he had got injured, he told his boss 'a pigeon did it'. 

All eyes in the star-studded north London studio were on Gascoigne during the rare TV appearance

Venables was also cited as his favourite gaffer, and was also the man who made him tearful on this show as he remembered how his soon-to-be Tottenham boss told the young Gascoigne if he joined him at Spurs 'in 10 days you'll be playing for England'. 

We also found out his favourite player to line up alongside was Bryan Robson, who he called 'dog poo. Because he was everywhere'. 

Actually, he probably didn't call him quite that in real life. He likely tidied that up for the cameras. 

Although a little later on, when the sound was briefly muted by BT, it was clear that he was having such a good time he had rather forgotten he was back on the box. 

But that was a small price for BT to pay because they definitely had a Gazza in the studio chatting apparently freely, and without the weight of the world on his shoulders. Helped, I would suggest, by a captive audience in the studio alongside him.

At turns, Rio Ferdinand, Ian Wright and West Ham's leading turn Russell Brand - at the game as very much the committed fan - sat in awe as he recounted his tall tales. 

These fellas aren't too shabby themselves, which just goes to show the inherent, unadulterated appeal of the Geordie boy. 

The anecdotes continued to come thick and fast. He told of how he recently bumped into Colin Hendry, who he'd famously turned inside out with 'that' goal against Scotland. 

The centre half asked him, 'What are you doing in London? I thought you lived in Bournemouth?'.

To which Gazza replied, 'What are you doing in London? I thought I left you at Wembley?'

The former England maestro also recalled a funny recent meeting with former Scotland defender Colin Hendry

He also spoke of how, as a young player at Newcastle, he once rang West Ham pretending to be his own agent because he was only earning £25 a week at his hometown club. 

'My mum was on £35 a week and she wasn't even playing for the Toon', he exclaimed, and brought the house down. 

He reminded us too of the deal he struck with Spurs to ensure he joined the North London club, and that it included a sunbed for his sister. 

'Savage always has that as part of his contracts', said Russell, getting the second biggest laugh of the morning.

He was also willing to confront some of those demons that had also haunted both Jimmy Greaves and Russell Brand at one point in their lives. 

Gazza also said Terry Venables was his favourite manager in a career that began at Newcastle United

Gascoigne became tearful on BT Sports when recalling how Venables told him that if he joined Spurs 'in 10 days you'll be playing for England'

He spoke of how his fundamental aim on a football pitch was to 'entertain the fans, win them over', but that sometimes it all just became too intense for him. 

'I was two-footing lampshades in the bedroom,' he said of the night before his infamous FA Cup Final appearance, so overwound was he. 

And he also admitted that even today 'it's sometimes hard to go to games... I end up analysing myself. I drive myself nuts. What would I have done there?' 

Here Brand became very much the fans' voice in the room when he turned straight to the man next to him on the settee and told him 'the greatness is still in you.'

'You mustn't feel sad,' he said. 'You've given the game so much.' 

There surely is no doubt that Brand spoke for all football fans when he made that heartfelt statement. And we can only hope that the Paul Gascoigne we see from this point forward is the same Gazza who had just had a great time, once again entertaining the nation from BT's couch.
