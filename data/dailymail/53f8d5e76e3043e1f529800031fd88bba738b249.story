Burnley have been rebuffed in a £4million approach for Wigan midfielder James McArthur.

The 26-year-old is keen on a move to the Premier League but Burnley will have to improve their bid.

McArthur joined Wigan from Scottish side Hamilton in 2010 and has made 151 appearances for the club.

No deal: Burnley have been rebuffed in a £4million approach for Wigan midfielder James McArthur

He flourished under Roberto Martinez at the DW Stadium and was one of only a handful of players who didn't move on when they suffered relegation. 

But after Uwe Rosler's side failed to win promotion via the play-offs last season, McArthur sees his future away from the club if a more substantial offer were to come in from the Clarets. 

Burnley kick-off their campaign against Chelsea on Monday, and have made a late bid to sign Stephen Ward from Wolves. The left-back was due to sign for Brighton again this weekend after a spell on loan last season.
