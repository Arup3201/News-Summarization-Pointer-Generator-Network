An angry mother-of-four plans to boycott her six-year-old son’s school carol concert after children, including his own brother and sister, were barred from attending over fears about background noise.

Melanie Whitehead, 40, has branded teachers at Eldwick Primary School, in Bingley, West Yorkshire, 'anti-children' over the ban and said she and her husband will not go to son Miles' show.

The Scrooge-esque rule means her two other children at the school, Scarlett, four, and Samuel, eight, will not be able to watch him perform.

The siblings will be barred from the concert at Bingley Parish Church after parents were asked not to bring their children.

Scarlett and Samuel will also be stopped from enjoying each others' performances in their own Christmas concerts at the school itself.

Mrs Whitehead said the bizarre no-children-allowed rule is taking the festive spirit out of Christmas and has pulled Miles out of the concert on December 10 as a result.

In a letter to parents head teacher Janice Kershaw stated children and babies 'will not be allowed in the concert because any background noise could make it difficult to hear the performers'.

She said 'fire regulations' also meant the school had to restrict the numbers.

Mrs Whitehead said: 'The church performance shocked me the most, I said Miles isn’t going to that one. He is not going, he is going to the rehearsal in the afternoon but he is not going to perform. Why should he?

'If we can’t go as a family to church to see him, I don’t see why we should go without our children and we can’t let our son perform without his parents being able to go and see him.

'I can even slightly understand how a school can put their own conditions in place but to restrict attendance at a church? I’m not even sure why that has happened.

'We will go to the other two but they are during school time, but for the evening one Miles isn’t going to.'

She said daughter Scarlett and son Samuel have never been in the same room to see each other perform.

'Its like a pantomime about people who can’t bring children to a nativity play,'she said.

'If Sam was playing Joseph, Scarlett couldn’t go in and see him.

'It all just doesn’t seem very Christmassy does it? Just seems a bit mean. It should be about the children after all.

'I don’t understand the mindset of it - the school is almost anti-children at Christmas.'

Letter from Eldwick Primary School head teacher Janice Kershaw banning children from attending

Head teacher Janice Kershaw said she would love to welcome children of all ages at Christmas but was prevented by practicalities such as fire regulations.

She said: 'We have a small school hall and of course it would lovely if we could accommodate everyone at Christmas.'

The letter sent to Mrs Whitehead and her solicitor-husband Robert, 42, states: 'Admission to the Concert will be for adults only on a ticket basis only, due to fire regulations. There will be a maximum of two tickets per family.

'We hope you will appreciate that other children and babies will not be allowed in the Concert because any background noise could make it difficult to hear the performers.

'We hope we have given adequate time to make alternative arrangements for their care.'

Mrs Whitehead said she was wanted the school to 'rethink' its attitude to families and young children she said were being 'discriminated against' by the rule.

She said: 'People just want to enjoy Christmas and have a more relaxed attitude towards it.

'There is a line you draw and sometimes a teacher or a school thinks they are in charge completely.

'You can’t tell a parent how to be a parent, the children should be allowed in and if they make a noise the parent can take them out or a teacher can then say take him out.

'You can’t just take the decision out of their hands, no kids in case they make any noise. Its common sense, it makes no sense to me.

'It’s something you read one year and think "You what? Are they having a laugh?". Then you write a letter one year and expect it to be changed and nothing happened.

'They were lovely and understood my concerns and understand that Christmas is about family but nothing changed.

'I think the children are missing out on an important part of Christmas, its something you look forward to and had become a dreadful worry.'

Melanie, of Bingley, said that she can remember one concert she and her husband had to 'tag-team', taking turns looking after Scarlett outside the door and popping in to watch the concert.

'If they changed the regulations and allowed young children in the church concert of course we would lift the boycott and go, we would love to go, it’s Christmas,' she said.

'The fact of the matter is that they won’t.

'It is bad enough tackling companies who are not child-friendly in every day life, for a school to have this attitude, at Christmas, is just ludicrous.'

The deputy head for Eldwick Primary School said headteacher Mrs Kershaw did not want to make any further comment at this point.
