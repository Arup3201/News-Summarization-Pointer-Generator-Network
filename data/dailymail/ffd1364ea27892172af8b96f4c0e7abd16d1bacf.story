Mark Kennedy spent eight years posing as eco-warrior Mark 'Flash' Stone

An undercover police officer has defended having sexual relationships with unsuspecting eco-activists, saying they were ‘essential’ to maintaining a convincing cover story.

Mark Kennedy, who spent eight years posing as eco-warrior Mark ‘Flash’ Stone,  has spoken out after learning that three women plan to sue the Metropolitan Police for emotional distress, saying he ‘duped’ them into sex.

‘I never conned anyone into having sex,’ he says. ‘I lived undercover for eight years and if I hadn’t had sex, I would have blown my cover. But I never used these women to gain information. The love we had was real.

‘I am not the first man to give a false name to a woman. I do have sympathy for those I may have hurt but this doesn’t warrant a lawsuit. The world of eco-activism is highly promiscuous. It was essential for me to have relationships in order to do my job.’

In total, eight women are accusing five undercover officers, including Kennedy, of causing them ‘intense emotional trauma and pain’.

The lawsuit, thought to be the first of its kind, alleges the ‘degrading deceit’ caused them psychiatric and psychological injuries, including depression, anxiety and trauma. It states: ‘It appears that [the men] used techniques they had been trained in to gain trust .  .  . officers obtained the consent of [these women] to sexual intercourse by deceit.’

Kennedy’s cover was blown a year ago and he has since left the police and moved to America, where he is working on a book and has signed a lucrative film deal. A Channel  4 documentary about him, Confessions Of An Undercover Cop, aired in November.

In 2002, Kennedy, 42, was recruited by the Met’s National Public Order Intelligence Unit and travelled throughout Britain and Europe, infiltrating activist groups as long-haired, tattooed protester Stone.

Kennedy, who is now getting divorced, insists he was celibate during his first year undercover.  ‘I avoided sexual contact, despite the fact that free love is part of that lifestyle,’ he says. ‘I was a new face with money and a van, so I was a catch but I said I’d just ended a relationship and was recovering emotionally.’

In fact, Kennedy was married to Edel, mother of his 12-year-old son and ten-year-old daughter, though he claims he and his wife stayed together only because of the children.

‘The subject of sex came up once during training,’ says Kennedy. ‘It was basically “Don’t do it.” But I talked to my cover officer dozens of times a day. There is no way he could not have known about a relationship. I told him where I was going and with whom. He knew where I spent my nights. I didn’t have to spell it out to him. I couldn’t go to the loo without him knowing. The police chose to turn a blind eye because the intelligence I was providing was so good.’

Kennedy says that his first sexual encounter came with a woman who ‘seduced’ him at a party in Leeds in 2003. He believes she is one of  his lawsuit accusers, although the women’s identities are not being  disclosed.

‘She came up and planted a huge kiss on me,’ he says. ‘One thing led to another and we ended up in bed. We had an on-off sexual relationship for two years. The lawsuit makes it sound as if I was predatory but I treated the women lovingly.

‘I am surprised she states we were in a relationship from 2003 to 2005. She had multiple lovers and I didn’t consider her a proper girlfriend.

‘I knew I had crossed the line by having sex with the people I was infiltrating but I felt I had little choice. One activist told me, “If a man doesn’t respond to sexual overtures, then it is likely he’s a cop or informant.” ’

He says the louche lifestyle promoted casual sex. ‘No one worked, so there was a party lifestyle, filled with drink and drugs like ecstasy, ketamine and marijuana,’ he says.

‘It was not unusual to have 100 to 150 people passing through a party lasting two or three days. There would always be a big bowl of condoms on the bar. They were vegan ones because regular condoms can contain animal by-products.’

Kennedy says that the sex-filled parties often had a theme. ‘At one party, called M&S / S&M, you had to wear something from Marks & Spencer with a sadomasochistic theme – the women were wearing cardigans with their breasts hanging out. At another, called the Queer Option, everyone cross-dressed – it was a case of anything goes.

‘The parties would end in a mass of arms and legs as people got into the free-love thing.’

He says children would frequently be present. ‘The parties would go on for days. One party had semi-naked mud-wrestlers and there were children wandering in and out, fascinated by all the high jinks.’

Kennedy says he never indulged in the sexual free-for-all because, by 2004, he had fallen in love with a red-haired Welsh activist to whom he remained devoted until his cover was blown.

‘I believe she is one of the women in the lawsuit,’ he says, sitting in a hotel near his home in Cleveland, Ohio. ‘When we met she was involved with another man but I was smitten. She ended things with her other boyfriend and we were totally in love with each other.’

He says he felt ‘terrible guilt’ in hiding his identity from her.  ‘I wanted to tell her, but I couldn’t.

‘I never used any information she gave me. To be frank, I had much better sources. After my identity was revealed, we met up and I told her how sorry I was. I thought we had made our peace.

‘This lawsuit is about money and politics. I was exposed and I admitted having these two relationships [of the third woman who cites a relationship with him between  February and September 2005, he says, “I haven’t a clue who that is”].

‘They are trying to discredit undercover police officers. Some people may have pound signs in their eyes, too. Perhaps they think the Met will pay them to go away.’

Kennedy’s cover for the £2 million operation was blown after a high-profile trial of eco-activists collapsed amid allegations that he had been organising the very protests he was being paid to help stop.

He too is planning a lawsuit against the Met. ‘The police did not properly support me. I did not receive the proper psychiatric counselling  during my eight years undercover and when my cover was blown, the police hung me out to dry,’ he says.

‘I lost my job, my girlfriend, my life. I will be suing for the emotional distress that caused.’

A Scotland Yard spokesman last night responded to Kennedy’s claims via email, saying: ‘There is a review under way led by Deputy Assistant Commissioner Mark Simmons which is assessing various issues arising from covert deployments over the period 1968-2008.

‘This is a complex process due to the elapsed time, the nature and volume of material and the inherent sensitivity of the issues.’

Harriet Wistrich, the lawyer representing the women, said: ‘There is a huge difference between not being totally honest about who you are and being an undercover policeman spying on your lover’s activities and those of her friends and associates.

‘There is no way that any of the claimants would have considered an intimate relationship with a man if they knew what his real job was . Kennedy was trained by the police to lie and deceive in order to gather information, as were the four other officers . 

‘What he and the other officers did to these women and what his bosses either sanctioned or turned a blind eye to was unlawful, sexist and has caused real psychological damage to those involved.’
