It was the night when Princess Diana met Hollywood royalty – and wowed the White House with her dancing dexterity.

In a midnight-blue silk velvet gown, watched admiringly by  Ronald and Nancy Reagan, the  princess swept around the room with John Travolta.

Iconic: Princess Diana wore this stunning midnight-blue Victor Edelstein gown when she famously danced with John Travolta at a White House event hosted by Ronald Reagan in 1985

Star of the auction: The midnight-blue gown fetched an astronomical £510,000, and also up for auction was

Versailles in 1994, and right

Sold: The late Princess Diana's dresses fetched huge amounts at an auction in Toronto

Big seller: The famous Vanity Fair gown fetched a whopping £160,000 at the Canadian auction

The Victor Edelstein dress, and the dance with the Saturday Night Fever star, helped establish Diana as a global fashion icon that night in 1985 when she and Prince Charles attended a  gala ball during their first tour of the U.S. together.

And early yesterday its significance was recognised when the gown was sold for £510,000 – the highest price fetched in an auction of 14 of the princess’s outfits in Toronto.

They were sold by an American, Maureen Rorech Dunkel, who bought them for £420,000 at a Christie’s auction in June 1997, two months before Diana’s death. The princess was at the time trying to raise money for her Aids and  cancer charities.

'Travolta dress': Victor Edelstein's iconic midnight blue velvet off-the-shoulder gown was part of an auction of 14 dresses which had all belonged to Diana

Line-up: The dresses were sold at auction in Toronto by private collector Maureen Rorech Dunke, who bought them at a charity auction by the Princess of Wales at Christie's in New York in June 1997

Miss Dunkel, a Florida-based  entrepreneur who filed for bankruptcy last year, left the room before the auction began, apparently overcome with emotion.

Although the outfits went for more than £2million in 25 minutes, some experts had forecast they would fetch double that.

A dinner dress and tailcoat of  burgundy velvet Diana wore to  the premiere of Steel Magnolias  in 1990 was auctioned for £130,000, having been estimated to raise at  least £170,000.

A long evening dress of Clerici  ivory satin, worn by the princess  during an official visit to Brazil in  1991, sold for £115,000 against an  estimate of £155,000.

And a cream silk crepe off-the- shoulder gown worn by the princess for a Mario Testino photoshoot,  which featured on the front cover of Vanity Fair magazine, sold for almost £160,000. It was estimated to make more than £220,000.

Sad end: Tampa businesswoman Maureen Dunkel poses with one of the dresses on display at Toronto's Design Exchange ahead of the auction. The proceeds will help pay off Ms Dunkel's debts

Enduring: This grey crepe gown, covered in pearls, which Diana wore for this famous Mario Testino photo shoot for Vanity Fair in 1997, was in the Toronto auction

Red carpet frocks: The sale included this crushed velvet gown, worn to the 1985 première of Back to the Future, left, and a black Bruce Oldfield dress, right, worn to the Les Misérables première the same year
