Former Liverpool manager Graeme Souness believes Nemanja Matic is better than retired Chelsea defensive midfielder Claude Makelele.

Souness lists Matic's  hold-up play, sense of danger and 'constant threat' among the reasons why the 26-year-old is greater than the man that inspired the position to be dubbed the 'Makelele Role'.

'Maybe only when you play with him do you appreciate how good he is. He's exactly what Arsenal needed, maybe what Liverpool needed, what (Manchester) United needed,' Souness wrote in his Sunday Times column.

Matic is more of a 'constant threat' than what Makelele used to be at Stamford Bridge, believes Souness

'As a midfielder, you want to get your head up and hit balls in to your striker but who's the face looking back at you? It used to be Makelele and now it is Matic. 

'He's better than Makelele, has a better range of passing and will get around the pitch better. 

'He's only 26, but has already mastered the position and, like (Cesc) Fabregas, will improve. He's bigger physically and a threat from set pieces.'

Matic and his Chelsea team-mates travel to Old Trafford to face Manchester United on Sunday.
