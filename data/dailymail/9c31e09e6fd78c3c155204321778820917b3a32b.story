The working-class labourer who could have been a lover of the poet Oscar Wilde while they were held at Reading Prison has been revealed.

Henry Bushnell, a petty thief, was a fellow inmate at the jail where Wilde had been imprisoned for homosexual acts in 1895.

Wilde is thought to have indicated his attraction to Bushnell who he described as a 'little dark-eyed chap' in a letter to a friend during his two-year prison sentence.

Now researchers from the University of Reading have uncovered never before seen pictures of inmates from the prison during the late 1890s.

And they believe the man he was referring to was Bushnell, a dark, handsome man, who only stood at five foot two inches tall.

Academics from the university uncovered the pictures of Bushnell, while trawling the archives of Berkshire Record Office.

The mugshots of Bushnell are are thought to be the only photos in existence of any of the working-class men Wilde took an interest in.

The researchers say that Bushnell was described as a prolific thief, who was sent to prison 21 times between 1892 and 1911.

And so taken was Wilde with Bushnell, it is thought that the writer sent him money and wrote to him after they were both released.

Professor Peter Stoneley, who lead the research told Mailonline: 'It is clear to see Wilde was interested in him and liked him and was part of a group of men he referred to as his pals. 

'I think the interest could have been a romantic one and there are certainly grounds for that. 

'But whether they were lovers it is difficult to say as Victorian prisons practiced solitary confinement and prisoners weren't even allowed to talk to each other.'  

Now pictures of Bushnell, along with those of other inmates, which forms part of a exhibition at Berkshire Record Office called 'Oscar Wilde and Reading Gaol', which open next week.

The research also uncovered a vast range of mugshots of prisoners taken during Wilde's time in jail. However, no mugshot was ever taken of the writer

Wilde began his famous two years in HMP Reading for 'gross indecency' with the son of a lord.

His imprisonment scandalised society in 1895 where he was also made to do hard-labour.

The jail time lead to one of Wilde's greatest works written about his time behind bars - 'The Ballard of Reading Gaol'.

Professor Stoneley added: 'The well-known legend of Reading Gaol has, until now, focused almost exclusively on the tragedy of Oscar Wilde. 

'But Wilde himself urged us to look beyond this story to ‘the others’, the men, women and children who were in prison alongside him. 

The modern day Reading Prison, which was eventually closed down for good earlier this year in January 

'It was seeing and understanding their suffering that helped him to come to terms with his own, and it made him an extraordinarily powerful advocate for prison reform. Yet until now, no genuine effort has been made to understand the circumstances of these men.

'It reminds us of the most attractive aspects of Wilde’s own character – his generosity of spirit, and his openness to the most despised members of his society.'

Wilde, a prolific poet and playwright renowned for his wit, was married and had two children at the time of his conviction.
