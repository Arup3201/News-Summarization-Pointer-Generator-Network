A crowd of onlookers watched in delight as a huge crane dropped an enormous pumpkin onto the ground at the Cherry Crest Adventure Farm in Pennsylvania.

The humongous pumpkin weighed a whopping 1,717 pounds and exploded into a dozen pieces when it landed on the ground below at the farm's annual pumpkin festival.

The pumpkin was grown by Paul and Cheryl Fulk of Jackson township who have been growing pumpkins for Cherry Crest Adventure Farm to smash for the past six years.

This year, the Fulks' pumpkin was their second heaviest ever (the current record belongs to a previous one that weighed a hefty 1,744 pound). 

The Fulks reveal that in order to grow a giant pumpkin, they grow the seeds inside starting on April 15, bringing the plants outside in the first week of May. 

They then dedicate their entire summer to taking care of the pumpkin.

Cheryl Fulk told Penn Live: 'In the beginning of the season when it first grows you can see them grow from morning to night.'

Paul Faulk added that the pumpkins can grow 40 pounds in one night.

Cherry Crest adventure farm is located in the heart of PA Dutch Country and describes itself as 'a unique place where fun, family, and farming come together.' 

Next year the Fulk's are hoping to grow a pumpkin that weighs 2,000 pounds and create another completely smashing pumpkin.
