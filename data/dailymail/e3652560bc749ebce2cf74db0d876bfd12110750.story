Luis Suarez scored his sixth goal in six games for Barcelona to shoot them into the Copa del Rey final.

The victory came at a cost with Sergio Busquets taken off on a stretcher towards the end of the first half after a bad challenge to his right ankle from Tomas Pina.

The Villarreal midfielder was sent off for an even worse challenge on Neymar in the second half as Suarez got on the score sheet. Neymar got the first and the third with Barcelona running out 6-2 winners on aggregate.

There were 20,000 yellow balloons in Villarreal’s tiny Madrigal Stadium at kick-off with the intention of creating a atmosphere of belief among the home supporters. Between them Suarez, Lionel Messi and Neymar went about bursting most of them after just three minutes.

Suarez found Messi with a superb cross-field pass from the left and Messi played an even better ball to find Neymar through the middle. The Brazilian beat Villarreal keeper Sergio Asenjo to the ball to put Barcelona one up.

It was Neymar’s 25th goal of the season and the tenth that has come from a Messi pass but strangely it didn’t kill the tie. Barcelona were loose at the back and Villarreal had chance after chance to get back on level terms.

Denis Cheryshev hit the side netting with the first opportunity and then full-back Jaume Costa beat Martin Montoya and crossed for Luciano Vietto to head at Marc-Andre ter Stegen. Pina then passed to Uche who sliced his finish into the side-netting. Cheryshev then forced another save from Ter Stegen from a similar position.

Barca had their chances too with Messi producing a pass that was almost identical to the one that had brought about the opening goal this time for Iniesta who couldn’t get his shot away before Victor Ruiz made the block.

But Villarreal continued to find space in behind Barcelona and six minutes before half time they got the equalizer. It was a bad 60 seconds for Barcelona. Pina followed through on a pass and went straight through Busquets’s right ankle. With the midfielder still down Villarreal raced away and Costa crossed from the right for Jonathan Dos Santos to finish past Ter Stegen.

Busquets was carried off on a stretcher and now needing just the two goals to draw level Villarreal went down the tunnel at half time believing they could pull off a shock.

They could have got the first of those goals with their first chance of the second half but Vietto’s header did not trouble Ter Stegen. Gerard Pique was booked for clattering the young Argentine striker while at the other end the game’s other Argentine forward went close – only Asenjo’s acrobatics keeping out Messi’s effort.

Villarreal had shot high and wide too often on the night however and on 66 minutes they shot themselves in the foot.

Mascherano loaded the bullet with a long pass forward and Suarez pulled the trigger with a centre-forward’s finish so typical of his Golden Shoe season at Liverpool and his recent form. Neymar completed the rout, converting substitute Xavi's pass.

Suarez can now look forward to his first final with Barcelona at the end of May and Barcelona can now turn their attention to the Champions League with Manchester City waiting for them in two weeks. Busquets' chances of making that second leg will depend on the result of scans on Thursday but if suspected ligament damage is confirmed they may have to do without him.
