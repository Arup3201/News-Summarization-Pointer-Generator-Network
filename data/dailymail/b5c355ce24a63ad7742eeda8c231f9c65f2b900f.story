A pioneering operation that shrinks the heart without surgery has been carried out in Britain for the first time – and may help thousands of people with heart failure.

A drawstring-like device is used to shut off damaged heart tissue.

It has given a new lease of life to  the first Briton to undergo the procedure. Before the operation, Sevket Gocer was so breathless he could  not walk.

Revolution: How the new non-bypass Less Invasive Ventricular Enhancement surgery is carried out

He had suffered two silent heart attacks that caused a large  area of damage to his heart – sending him into heart failure, in which  the heart enlarges and cannot pump effectively.

‘There was very little I could do without having to stop as I was out of breath and exhausted. Just going upstairs at home was an effort,’ says the 58-year-old, who has diabetes.

Heart failure affects more than 750,000 people in the UK.

‘When people are not able to walk around because their heart is too weak, they are at increased risk of death,’ says Professor of Cardiac Surgery Olaf Wendler, who carried out the operation at King’s College Hospital in London.

‘It is not unusual for a patient to have heart attacks without knowing – and the patient has no idea of the damage caused. They become aware something isn’t right when minor exercises cause breathlessness and simple tasks become difficult. Diabetics are at high risk of developing coronary heart disease, and scarring from heart attacks is one of the main reasons for developing heart failure.’

If the heart has been scarred, the damaged area is useless.

The conventional operation for heart scarring is to stop the heart and cut out the scarred area while the patient is kept alive on a heart-bypass machine.

But this is a risky procedure that doesn’t always produce an improvement.

Given Mr Gocer’s frail health, Mr Wendler decided to try the new operation – known as Less Invasive Ventricular Enhancement, or LIVE.

LIVE can be performed without bypass. It is still necessary to make an incision of 12 to 15cm to open up the chest wall.

However, the heart doesn’t have to be cut open.

Then, using an X-ray, a needle guides a wire through the left ventricle – one of the heart’s four chambers – and across the scarred area of the heart. The wire is anchored to the walls of the chamber – and then pulled taut to seal off the scarred part of left ventricle.

This significantly reduces the size  of the left ventricle, which is the part responsible for pumping blood around the body and which swells and scars during a heart attack. With the scarring sealed off, the ‘resized’ organ is able to pump much more effectively.

Mr Gocer, from Bromley, South London, first developed breathing difficulties last year, over several months. He said: ‘My family urged me to get the breathlessness checked and I was referred to King’s by my local hospital. When they scanned me, they could see the scarring and the cardiologist reckoned I’d had two “silent” heart attacks without any pain.’

Before being referred for the procedure this summer, Mr Gocer was worried that he wouldn’t see his two young grandsons grow up.

‘I was told it might give me another ten years, which would be great. No one knows precisely because I’m the first in this country to have had it. But I’m definitely feeling the benefit.’

The hour-long operation is being tested at hospitals across Europe and Mr Wendler believes it could help many thousands of patients.

‘If successful, the operation can bring patients on to an exercise level where they’re able to look after themselves properly, including doing the shopping and having a social life,’ he says. ‘It’s superb that Mr Gocer is doing so well.’

Arsenal fan Mr Gocer had stopped attending football matches because  he ran out of breath walking to the ground. But now he is going again, as well as taking long walks. ‘Last week  I walked over a mile,’ he says. ‘Afterwards I felt fantastic.’
