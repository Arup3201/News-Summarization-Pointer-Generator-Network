He was the man your man could smell like. Or, rather, could have smelled like.

Because sexy Old Spice man, who has fronted the tongue-in-cheek video campaigns for the retro aftershave brand since 2010, has been usurped... by a wolfdog puppet.

Actor Isaiah Mustafa, who gained sudden fame when he was cast as the brooding, half-naked Old Spice man in their 2010 commercial, has been replaced by a character known as Mr Wolfdog, whose 'official' title is Executive Director of Marketing.

SCROLL DOWN FOR VIDEOS

The new collection of Old Spice viral ads stars Mr Wolfdog, the brand's new Executive Director of Marketing

In a series of new viral adverts available on the brand's YouTube channel, Mr Wolfdog introduces himself and explains some of his new ideas and working methods.

Gone is the sultry opening line, 'Ladies, look at your man, now back to me, now back at your man, now back to me', delivered by the Old Spice man standing in front of a shower in a towel.

Instead, the new comedy viral video Meet The Wolfdog - which has already notched up almost  a million hits on the brand's YouTube channel - begins with a howl.

Sitting in his office surrounded by executive toys, awards and Old Spice coffee mugs, Mr Wolfdog then explains how Old Spice were looking for someone to market their new Wild Collection of scents: 'Someone from the wild, and I guess that's me, director Wolfdog, new executive director of marketing.'

Mr Wolfdog may not ride a white horse on a palm-fringed beach, but he certainly means business

Mr Wolfdog then demonstrates his professional prowess by stamping documents, using a calculator and inviting office underlings to hang more business awards.

After eating some of said underlings ('Sometimes you gotta eat people, America, that's how business works'), Mr Wolfdog invites viewers to read his tumblr blog and follow his tweets, before saying he plans to make Old Spice's Wild Collection 'the wildest brand in the world'.

He may not be as sexy as Old Spice Guy, and he may not ride a white horse on a palm-fringed beach, but Mr Wolfdog certainly means business.

The famous 2010 advert began with Isaiah Mustafa saying, 'Ladies, look at your man, now back to me, now back at your man, now back to me', while standing in front of a shower in a towel
