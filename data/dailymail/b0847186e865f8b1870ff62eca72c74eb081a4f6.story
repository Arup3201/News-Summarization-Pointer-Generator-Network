A combative Barack Obama last night stepped up his fight for presidential re-election, claiming the U.S. would be ‘fundamentally crippled’ if the Republicans got into power.

The President, speaking at an $18,000-per-person fundraiser in Medina, Washington, is desperate to renew the enthusiasm of Democratic loyalists who are growing more disenchanted with him daily.

He told around 65 guests at an intimate brunch that he is tired of a ‘constant ideological pushback’ from the GOP ‘against any kind of sensible reforms’ to help improve the economy and job market.

President Obama, 50, was speaking on Sunday at the home of former Microsoft executive Jon Shirley on the liberal West Coast, for the first of seven fundraisers he is holding over a three-day period.

He was also due to take in Hollywood and San Diego in California, as well as Denver, Colorado, in a series of events to help him re-engage with some of his most liberal and deep-pocketed supporters.

The trip comes as an under-fire President Obama has shifted from concentrating on compromise with Republicans on Capitol Hill to calling out GOP House Speaker John Boehner and others by name.

He has criticised them as obstructionists while demanding their help in passing his $447billion jobs bill. His revamped approach is a relief to Democratic activists who want to see a stronger President.

They are fed up by what they view as the President's conceding of ground to the GOP on tax cuts and other issues while the economy has stalled and unemployment is stuck above nine per cent.

President Obama said 2012 would be an especially tough election because people are discouraged and disillusioned with government, but he also said he was determined because so much is at stake.

‘(The GOP alternative is) an approach to government that will fundamentally cripple America in meeting the challenges of the 21st century,’ President Obama said.

‘And that's not the kind of society that I want to leave to (my daughters) Malia and Sasha.'

President Obama got a friendly welcome from invited guests at his first stop. But liberal activists later greeted the president with a demonstration.

‘We want to see Obama stand up as strongly as he can to fight for the people of this country who are working out there to make ends meet,’ said Kathy Cummings, of the Washington State Labor Council.

The group helped organise a demonstration outside Seattle's Paramount Theater, the site of a fundraiser with about 1,800 guests. Activists held signs and urged President Obama to: ‘Tax the rich.’

President Obama and the GOP presidential candidates are working to raise campaign cash ahead of an important end-of-month reporting deadline that will give a snapshot of their financial strength.

President Obama's West Coast visit was heavy on fundraisers - two each in Seattle and the San Francisco area Sunday, followed by one in San Diego on Monday and two in Los Angeles.

He is meeting with the Silicon Valley and Hollywood elite, including an event on Sunday night in Atherton, California, at the home of Facebook chief operating officer Sheryl Sandberg.

The expected haul from all seven events is $4 million or more.

In addition to the fundraising, President Obama scheduled a town hall-style event Monday in Silicon Valley, hosted by social networking company LinkedIn.

The trip ends on Tuesday with a speech to supporters in Denver, where he accepted the Democratic nomination three years ago.

President Obama was pushing throughout for his job proposal, which combines tax cuts, unemployment benefits and public works spending.

The bill faces a hostile reception on Capitol Hill, particularly because President Obama wants to pay for it with tax increases opposed by Republicans.

A top aide said the White House expects a vote in the Democratic-controlled Senate next month.

Despite deep reservations even from some in the President's own party, ‘I think it's got a very good chance’ of passing, David Plouffe told ABC.

If he can't persuade Congress to pass the bill, President Obama has said he wants to make sure the public knows who's standing in the way.

Jobs are a major concern in California, where unemployment stands at 12.1 per cent - the highest of any state except Nevada.

Mark DiCamillo, director of California's Field Poll, said that has contributed to a softening of support for President Obama among Democratic and independent voters.

President Obama's job approval rating dropped to 46 per cent among Californians in a Field Poll this month. Among Democrats it was 69 per cent, but that was down 10 percentage points from June.

‘Californians voted for him by 24 points 
in 2008 and the Democrats and non-partisans were the backbone of his 
support and he's losing some of that now,’ Mr DiCamillo said.

‘They're looking for Obama to do something.’ Unfortunately for the President, the summer's nasty debate over raising the government's borrowing limit turned off voters.

Many liberals bemoaned the deal that cleared the way for a higher debt ceiling, with President Obama agreeing to Republican demands for steep budget cuts without new taxes.

But Democratic supporters are heartened by the jobs plan and President Obama's insistence that Congress must raise taxes to pay for it.

Now they are hoping that the confrontational Obama they are seeing now is the same one they will see through the 2012 campaign.

Rick Jacobs, head of the Courage Campaign, a progressive online organizing network in California, said: ‘We wish that his fighting spirit had been there a few months ago, but it's here now.’
