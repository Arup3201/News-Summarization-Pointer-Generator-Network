A new investigation has been launched  into child deaths following heart operations in Bristol, almost 20 years after concerns were first raised there.

Professor Sir Ian Kennedy, who chaired the public inquiry into baby deaths at the Bristol Royal Infirmary in the 1990s, will initially look at nine recent cases.

But a well-placed source said Sir Ian could  end up investigating many more as other families came forward.

A new investigation has been launched into child deaths following heart operations. It will focus on whether Bristol Children's Hospital had enough skilled nurses to care for very ill children

The QC has been asked to head the independent review by NHS medical director Professor Sir Bruce Keogh, who agreed to the investigation after meeting bereaved families on Friday.

When Sir Ian published his public inquiry report in 2001 he found that a ‘club culture’ among surgeons had prevented young  doctors from raising concerns about high death rates on the operating table.

The competence of Bristol’s cardiac surgeons is unlikely to be called into question, however. Instead the new investigation will focus on whether Bristol Children’s Hospital, sited next to the Infirmary, had enough skilled nurses to care for very ill children.

Families claim they had to clean up  vomit and even give medicines themselves because of a lack of nursing staff. Several said their children were taken out of intensive care too soon. In a disturbing echo of the original scandal, parents also claim their concerns have been ignored.

Prof Keogh said he agreed to the review after listening to the ‘dignified and powerful’ arguments of bereaved families. ‘It was clear .  .  . such a review would need to be independent of the NHS. It must be led by the families. It must be their review,’ he added.

Among the deaths Sir Ian will investigate are those of Sean Turner and Luke Jenkins. Sean, four, died in March 2012 on Ward 32 after corrective heart surgery, while Luke, seven, died in April that year, days after being moved from intensive care.

It is their parents who pushed to 
meet Prof Keogh. It is thought he agreed after hearing the parents of 
seven other children were also taking legal action against University 
Hospitals Bristol NHS Foundation Trust.

Sean’s
 mother, Yolanda, 47, from Warminster, Wiltshire, said: ‘We are 
concerned that not only did our children die due to bad care, but the 
details surrounding their care have not been properly investigated.’

A
 hospital spokesman said: ‘The Trust remains troubled that families 
whose children we have cared for continue to have concerns about the 
care provided despite our attempts to respond to these issues.'
