Health officials are urging people suffering winter vomiting bug to stay at home rather than visiting A&E or their GP

Patients with the winter vomiting bug are being urged to stay at home as it already rife in some hospitals.

Figures show there were 18 outbreaks in hospitals last month with nearly 200 patients and staff struck down.

Although this is no higher compared to previous years, officials warn that it is highly contagious and unpredictable

Public Health England – the agency responsible for preventing illness – is urging patients with symptoms not to visit their GP or A&E.

The virus causes sudden vomiting, diarrhoea, headaches and a temperature that normally go away by themselves between 24 and 48 hours.

Yet it can be very serious for the elderly who are already very ill in hospital and lead to severe dehydration and death.

John Harris, an expert in norovirus at Public Health England said: ‘October usually marks the start of the norovirus season and the bulk of cases will occur between now and April next year.

‘No two norovirus seasons are the same and there is no way of predicting how busy a season will be. What we do know is that many people will be affected across the country and they will probably feel very unwell for a couple of days but will get better.

‘For patients already ill in hospital, this virus could cause further health complications, making it vital to prevent introducing the virus into the hospital environment.

‘We strongly urge anyone affected to stay at home and to telephone NHS111 for advice.’

Figures for last month show there were 18 outbreaks at hospital – most of which led towards being closed – with 130 patients and 57 staff affected.

This is slightly lower compared to last year and significantly down on 2012 when a new strain of the virus caused far higher rates than normal.

There is no treatment and patients are advised to drink plenty of water and rehydration drinks such as Dioralyte sachets.

Although it is far commoner in the colder months, the virus is prevalent all year round and is often caught by eating oysters, where it lives.

But each winter it puts the NHS under huge strain because hospitals have to close off wards to prevent the spread which limits the numbers of patients that can be admitted. 

Staff must then have to find space elsewhere in the hospital for all those patients while the ward is thoroughly cleaned.
