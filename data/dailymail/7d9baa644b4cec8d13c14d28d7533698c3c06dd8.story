A mother has blamed doctors for her two-year-old's son eating habits after he refuses to eat anything but biscuits and now weighs the same as a three-month-old baby.

Anastasia Shields, 23, from Northway in Gloucester, says she has tried everything to get Harvey-Jay to eat, including sneaking high-fibre milkshakes into his hot chocolate.

She has hit out at doctors after her son, who weighs just 15lbs - spent 10 days at Gloucestershire Royal Hospital and medics failed to diagnose the problem and told her he may just be a fussy eater.

Mrs Shields said: 'Something needs to be done before we end up putting him in a coffin. He weighs less than a three-month-old baby. It's just ridiculous.'

'Half of the doctors in hospital hadn't read all of his notes before they came to see us. The whole time we were in there, it felt like we were doing the same things as at home.'

Mrs Shields and her husband Andrew claim to have tried everything to get him eating wholesome and nutritious food but he will only eat biscuits, including fig rolls and chocolate digestives.

They are occasionally able to trick him into eating cookie cereal because he thinks he is eating mini biscuits.

Harvey-Jay is two-years-old but weights only 15lbs, which is the same as a three-month-old baby

Mrs Shields said: 'He will just play with food in his mouth and that's it. I'm at the end of my tether. I don't know what to do.

'Maybe it's an oral phobia. He never really put things in his mouth when he was baby, which was very unusual.

'The doctors think it might be a behavioural problem but I don't believe that because he's been like this since he was born.

'In his first month alive he lost a whole pound, it took us months to get his weight back up to what it had been when he was born.

'The only variety he adds to the diet is that he some times has a mouthful of yoghurt or a nibble of a bacon flavour crisp. 

'It's got to the point now where he just runs away crying from plates of food - people keep trying to force him to eat and it's making the situation worse.' 

The mother-of-two said she was disappointed that doctors have done little more than suggest her son is just a fussy eater.

She added that Harvey-Jay's weight loss has led to his skin become stretchy, a pale complexion and he is now prone to becoming ill more easily.

Harvey-Jay was not born prematurely and although he was a light baby, weighing 5lbs 1oz, he was not critically under-weight. 

The couple, who have a healthy five-year-old daughter called Lilly, are now considering the offer of sending him to a special pre-school in Cheltenham which may help him.

A spokesman for Gloucestershire Hospitals NHS Foundation Trust, which runs Gloucestershire Royal Hospital, said: 'We are committed to providing high quality and safe care for our patients and we take complaints seriously.

'We are disappointed to hear that Mrs Shields was unhappy and would like to continue to work with her to look into her concerns through our Patient Advice and Liaison Team so we can answer any questions she may have about her son's care.' 

Former GP and patient advocate Dr Mike Smith said: ‘If this little boy is really only eating biscuits I can certainly understand his parents’ concern.

‘Presumably being the weight he is, the hospital will have followed up his stay and will be following his progress closely - at his weight they would not just let him go home and leave it there.

‘And presumably, after a stay of 10 days in hospital if they can find no medical problems I should imagine a specialist paediatrician will be closely watching his progress over the coming months and years.

‘What he is currently eating is clearly not a satisfactory diet. He’s not getting everything he needs as he would if he were eating fruit and vegetables.

‘He’s not getting enough vitamin c, or micro-nutrients like anti-oxidants and that sort of thing.

‘I cannot believe that the hospital would not have assigned him a dietary nutritionist to work with his parents to advise them on how best to give him a balanced diet.

‘This boy’s parents need to work with a nutritionist and specialist paediatrician and follow their advice to ensure their child receives a balanced diet.’
