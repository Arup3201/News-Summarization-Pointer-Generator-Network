Eligible: Investment banker James Matthews with his brother and Made In Chelsea star Spencer

Pippa Middleton has been 'dating' the wealthy investment banker brother of Made In Chelsea star Spencer Matthews.

The Duchess of Cambridge's sister has been seen out and about in London with James Matthews and friends have said their relationship is going from 'strength to strength'

The couple were spotted having dinner at the posh Queen's Club tennis centre in West London and nine days ago the 37-year-old was photographed holding open a taxi door for Pippa, 29, outside a West End restaurant.

An onlooker at the trendy Hakkasan restaurant told the Sunday Mirror the couple were 'openly flirting' as they shared a bottle of wine in a 'secluded booth'.

They added: 'They were deep in conversation ad only had eyes for each other. Pippa was all smiles and kept giggling.

'They stayed for nearly three houses and didn't seem to want the meal to end.'

James a former Eton pupil, is chief executive of Eden Rock Capital Management Group, which he set-up more than 10-years-ago.

His brother Spencer, 24, has starred in E4's Made In Chelsea reality soap since it first aired last year and their parents, David and Jane, bought Eden Rock, a luxury hotel in the Caribbean, in 1995.

Pippa, who has been seen out with 
other stars of the popular show, split with her boyfriend of 
three-years, City banker Alex Loudon, last year.

She has since been linked with the Duke of Northumberland's son, George Percy, 28, a friend from her time as a student at Edinburgh University.

A friend of Pippa's added: 'Pippa is quite taken with James.

'She wants to take things slowly at first but she she is ready for a full-time man in her life again.'

Pippa was embroiled in controversy earlier this year when she was pictured laughing in a car as a man brandished what appeared to be a gun at photographers in Paris.

She was in France for an 18th Century-themed ball, which was also attended by a stripper, dwarf and people in bondage gear.

Last week, she launched a party guide, Celebrate: A Year of British Festivities for Families and Friends, having been paid a Â£400,000 advance.
