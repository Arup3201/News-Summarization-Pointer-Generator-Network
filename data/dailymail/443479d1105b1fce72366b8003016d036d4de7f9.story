Court: Dr Colin Whitehurst, 54, (right) pleaded guilty to causing unnecessary suffering when he appeared at Trafford Magistrates' Court

A respected scientist who tried to poison rats prowling in the two-acre grounds of his home ended up condemning  his neighbour’s cat to an agonising death.

Dr Colin Whitehurst, 54, left a mixture of bacon, tuna and slug pellets on a roofing slate placed by a tree.

But instead of ridding the garden of vermin, his concoction proved irresistible to Tallulah, a silver tabby, who was found foaming at the mouth with her back arched in agony.

Neighbours claimed the inventor, who patented medical lighting equipment for hospitals, had once told them he did not like having wildlife in his  garden.

Tallulah’s devastated owner David Furness, 41, hit out after the wealthy scientist was ordered to pay costs but escaped any other sentence.

Under the Animal Welfare Act 2006 the maximum sentence for causing unnecessary suffering to an animal is a £20,000 fine or six months’ imprisonment, or both.

Mr Furness said: ‘The sentence is very lenient – you get more for not having a tax disc.

‘We were devastated about Tallulah. She was only 18 months old and what happened to her was terrible. She was a lovely cat with a lovely nature.

‘The chap would openly say to me he didn’t want any wildlife living in the area – but what I can’t understand was why he then bought a property with all that land. If you move to the country this is what you are going to get.’

Mr Furness, a dog breeder and kennel owner, said the baited roofing slate had been left propped against a tree on the boundary he shares with Whitehurst in the village of Little Bollington, Cheshire.

He added: ‘He is quite in his rights to kill rats in a contained way but where he put the poison was near the public right of way. A child could have picked it up and plenty of families walk through there. It just seems a shabby, dirty and cruel trick – knowing we have all the animals.’

The deadly concoction accidentally killed his next-door neighbour's silver tabby cat Tallulah after she ate the mixture, which was left on a grey roofing slate propped up against a tree

Tallulah's owner David Furness said he was 'devastated' about the death of his 18-month-old tabby cat

Trafford magistrates were told the 
incident occurred last November at Whitehurst’s £650,000 detached house.

Anna McDonald, prosecuting for the RSPCA, said: ‘It was rapidly acting 
poison and causes fits, often within 30 minutes of ingestion. The cat 
would have suffered an unpleasant death and the suffering was 
unnecessary.

‘Placement showed a disregard to wildlife. Mixing it with food made it attractive to all wildlife in the area.’

The court heard how the incident occurred in November last year at Whitehurst's £650,000 detached house in Cheshire (pictured) next to the Kottage Kennels which is run by Mr Furness

The cat had suffered from effects of slug pellets, bait and poison which crippled her nervous system

Whitehurst
 admitted causing unnecessary suffering and was handed a 12-month 
conditional discharge and ordered to pay £2,493 costs. Paul Fitton, 
defending, said: ‘He is extremely remorseful. Historically there have 
been problems with rats on the land.

‘The next property, which keeps dogs, has kennels made from stables and rats have been on the border of this land.

‘There was no intention to harm any animal, he was naive to bait the poison with leftovers. He is not an animal hater.’

Chairman
 Margaret Sturt told Whitehurst: ‘A cat has died under distressing 
circumstances but we also understand there was no intention to cause 
harm to any animals apart from killing rats.’

It emerged the poison had been placed on a roofing slate that had been propped against a tree in order to create a 'bait station'

Prosecutor for the RSPCA, Miss Anna McDonald said: 'The cat died as a consequence of poisoning. It was rapidly acting poison and causes fits often within 30 minutes of ingestion'
