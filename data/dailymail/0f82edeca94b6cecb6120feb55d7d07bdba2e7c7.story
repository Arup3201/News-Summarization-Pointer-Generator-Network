Where is she? Mother-of-two Jennifer Huston, 38, vanished as she ran errands in Oregon on July 24, but a new sighting placed her in Washington on Thursday

The search for a missing Oregon mother-of-two has expanded to the San Juan Islands off the coast of Washington state - about 300 miles from where she was last seen eight days ago.

Jennifer Huston, from Dundee, Oregon, was captured by surveillance cameras taking out cash at a bank, filling up her car with gas and then buying snacks and sleeping pills at a Rite Aid on July 24.

But the married mom-of-two has not been seen since. Her cell phone stopped working minutes after she was seen at the gas station and she has not used her credit cards in the past week.

As questions swirl around what could have happened to Mrs Huston, authorities are now searching the San Juan Islands, where Huston would enjoy visiting her family, Fox reported.

Authorities say she could be there or could be on her way there.

Captain Jeff Kosmicki of the Newberg-Dundee Police Department said her car, a 1999 dark green Lexus LX 470 SUV, would be able to travel 300 to 350 miles after she filled up the tank.

She was filmed filling up her car at a Circle K gas station around 6.20pm last Thursday.

Before, she withdrew a small amount of cash from the Oregon First Community Credit Union, then bought a Gatorade, trail mix and non-lethal sleeping 
pills at a Rite Aid pharmacy.

Last seen: Police released these surveillance footage 
stills of Mrs Huston's car at a gas station just minutes before she vanished last Thursday. Her cell phone stopped working shortly after

Her husband Kallen, who has passed a polygraph test, told investigators his wife had left to run errands and had been complaining of a headache for several days before she went out.

As she left the gas station, her cell phone stopped working - either because it ran out of battery or because it was switched off.

Authorities say they need more technical date to determine which direction she was heading in, and they also are trying to get the bank security footage to share with the public in case they can help.

But so far, they are struggling to get their hands on what they need because they have to be able to prove a crime has been committed - which they cannot.

As the search expands, aerial searches are also being carried out.

Mr Huston has said that his wife complained of headaches three days before disappearing, but she hadn't seen a doctor. At a press conference on Monday, he said he feared she'd crashed her car

Mrs Huston was a stay-at-home mother to her two sons, aged two and six. Her husband previously said he'd told them she was on vacation because he couldn't bear to tell them the truth.

He also expressed his fears that she might be 'in a ditch somewhere' after driving her car off the road and urged motorists to look out for his wife..

'I ask that anybody helping us, 
regardless of the area they are in, look off to the left and off to the 
side of the highways,' he said.

'This is totally unlike her. She's a 
devoted mother. Sheâ€™s just a very good person, and for her to do 
something like this is completely out of the norm.'

She was last seen wearing black and pink Nike shoes and black yoga pants. Her car, a 1999 Lexus LX 470, has an Oregon license plate of WXH 011.

Mrs Huston's mobile phone has been switched off since her disappearance on Thursday. Her family has created a Facebook page to share photographs and information
