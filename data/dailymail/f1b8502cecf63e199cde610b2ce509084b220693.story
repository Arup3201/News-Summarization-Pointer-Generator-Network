The Indianapolis Colts football player who was suspended after taking fertility drugs has welcomed a baby girl into the world.

Robert Mathis proudly posted pictures on Thursday of him cradling his newborn baby in his arms after she was born on Saturday.

In a caption the Indianapolis Colts linebacker also appeared to allude to his four-game suspension over banned substances.

Game changer: NFL star Robert Mathis, who was suspended after taking fertility drugs, kisses his baby girl

The NLF star fell foul of American football rules in May when he tested positive for Clomid, which is on the banned substance list because of its affect on testosterone levels.

Mathis had argued that the drug was part of fertility treatment he was undergoing as he and wife Brandi tried for a third child.

The couple, who have twin boys, decided to expand their family to honor a request from the football player's mother, who is fighting cancer.

When he acknowledged taking the banned substance in May, Mathis admitted he had made a mistake by not checking if the drug would be a problem during testing.

But the woes surrounding his suspension from the first four games of the suspension were far from the 32-year-old's thoughts this week.

His Instagram page showed pictures of his newborn daughter next to a post where he had written: 'Last time i address it then after that may god bless it: I have no opinion on anyone else's situation bc #myunit don't benefit from it.

'This is my current situation in my arms and that's that! #gocolts #fff(in that order).'

Previously, he had posted pictures of him wearing hospital scrubs as his wife prepared to give birth.

'#SuperPoppz checking in for duty!!! sound the alarm #ThePrincessIsComing,' he had written on the day the baby was born.

Supporters of the football player posted messages of congratulations, and said they were looking forward to seeing him back in action after the suspension ends.

Back in the game: Mathis will rejoin his team on September 29

The Colts had also supported Mathis, who had appealed against the NFL ruling because of his reasons for needing to take the substance.

'Everybody in this organization has his back and we'll get through this and at the end of the day, we'll all be better for it,' coach Chuck Pagano told NFL.com.

The proud father and linebacker is due to make his first appearance of the season on September 29.
