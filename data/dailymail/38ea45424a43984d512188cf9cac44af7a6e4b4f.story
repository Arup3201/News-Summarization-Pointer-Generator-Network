A former Delaware middle school teacher has avoided jail after exchanging explicit photos and having sex with one of her 13-year-old students. 

Stephanie Seabury, then 22, was captured on surveillance video climbing into her car outside Fred Fifer III Middle School in Camden with the unidentified boy on February 26.

She then drove the teenager to her home at Dover's Woodmill Apartments, where she had sexual intercourse with him. Several weeks later, on March 12, the boy complained to police.

Sentenced to probation: Stephanie Seabury (pictured, left, in her mugshot and, right, at Fred Fifer III Middle School in Delaware) has avoided jail after exchanging explicit photos and having sex with one of her students

Scene: Seabury, then 22, was seen climbing into her car with the 13-year-old boy on February 26. She then drove him to her home at Dover's Woodmill Apartments (above), where she had sexual intercourse with him

During a subsequent investigation, officers uncovered a series of 'explicit phone message and photographs [sent] during the inappropriate relationship,' police told NBC. 

Seabury, who had taught English at the school since August last year, turned herself into police on April 28. She was charged with sexual abuse of a child by a person in a position of trust or authority.

Last Wednesday, she pleaded guilty to one count of fourth-degree rape, Delaware Online reported.

But on Monday, the 23-year-old escaped jail after being sentenced to 18 months' probation by Superior Court Judge, Robert B. Young. She must also register as a Tier II sex offender.

Following her sentencing, reporters attempted to contact Seabury at her family home. A man who answered the door told them to call her lawyer, before adding: 'She's innocent.'

According to police, investigators contacted officials at Fred Fifer III on March 13 - a day after the boy complained of being assaulted at Seabury's apartment in the 1300 block of S. Farmview Drive.

Staff confirmed that the victim was one of Seabury's students. While working with police, they also located the surveillance footage showing the pair leaving the school together on the day of the rape.

'It was a very highly inappropriate relationship,' said Dover Police Corporal, Mark Hoffman, last week. 'Especially with a 13-year-old and a 22-year-old, and, of course, being a teacher.'

Seabury, a Long Island, New York, native and University of Delaware graduate, has also been ordered to have no contact with either the victim or other children.
