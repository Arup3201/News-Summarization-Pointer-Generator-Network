The Australian team said that weightlifter Francois Etoundi has been stripped of his Commonwealth Games accreditation after being arrested over an alleged assault in the athletes' village in Glasgow.

Etoundi is due in court in Glasgow later on Thursday after being arrested following an altercation early on Wednesday morning.

The Cameroon-born Etoundi won bronze in the 77kg division on Sunday.

Punished: The Australian team have said that  Francois Etoundi has been stripped of his accreditation

Discipline: Etoundi won bronze in the 77kg category, but was involved in an incident in the athletes' village

Australia team chief Steve Moneghetti said the incident occurred in the residential part of the village.

Moneghetti says Etoundi's accreditation was revoked before any conviction because the incident was 'a breach of the village rules.'

Moneghetti also announced that athletics head coach Eric Hollingsworth is being sent home for releasing an unauthorised statement criticising Olympic hurdles champion Sally Pearson for not attending the team's pre-Glasgow training camp.
