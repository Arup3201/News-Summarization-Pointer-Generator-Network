Siem de Jong is a major doubt for Newcastle United’s season opener against Manchester City.

As revealed by Sportsmail last week, the Dutch midfielder suffered a calf injury after returning from New Zealand last month and has not featured since.

He was again absent for United’s final pre-season friendly against Real Sociedad on Sunday and now faces a race to build fitness for the visit of the champions.

De Jong – a £6million summer buy from Ajax – had impressed during the warm-up matches until injury struck.

Boss Alan Pardew will be hoping it proves a minor setback for a player who missed parts of last season in Holland because of niggling muscle injuries.

Meanwhile, Cheick Tiote is definitely out of next Sunday’s game with a hamstring problem.

The Ivorian played at Sheffield Wednesday at the end of last month but has been sidelined since and he could miss the first couple of fixtures of the new season.
