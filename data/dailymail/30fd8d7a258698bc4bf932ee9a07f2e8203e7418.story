Republican Rep. Peter King said Sunday that President Barack Obama should take the threat of expatriates turned jihadists returning home to commit acts of terrorism as seriously as British Prime Minister David Cameron.

King, a member of the House of Representatives' Intelligence committee and the former chair of it's Homeland Security committee, said that 'the United States is always the main target of these terrorist organizations,' so he is 'very concerned' about an attack from Islamic radicals.

'And i would say, I wish our president was showing the same leadership that David Cameron showed,' he added. 'What is President Obama waiting for?'

President Barack Obama and Rep. Peter King of New York walk down the steps of the House following a St. Patricks Day luncheon at the Capitol in March. King, a Republican, said Sunday he wishes Obama were more like British Prime Minister David Cameron

On Friday Cameron raised his country's terror threat level to 'severe' - the second highest alert level in Britain's five category system - for the first time in three years.

In making the announcement, Cameron called the Islamic State a 'greater and deeper threat to our security than we have known before.'

'People are rightly concerned about so-called foreign fighters who travel from Britain to Syria and Iraq, taken part in terrorist acts, and now come back to threaten our security here at home,' he said.

'And the scale of this threat is growing.'

The White House opted not to issue it's own terror advisory ahead of the Labor Day holiday, saying: 'We donâ€™t at this point see a reason to change the threat level in this country.'

Homeland Security Secretary Jeh Johnson said in a statement that his agency was 'unaware of any specific, credible threat to the U.S. homeland.'

Rather, 'violent extremists who support ISIL have demonstrated the intent and capability to target American citizens overseas, and ISIL constitutes an active and serious threat within the region,' he said.

Johnson assured Americans that DHS had beefed up security at airports throughout the past few weeks, just like its counterparts across the pond, and said the U.S. had 'taken a series of steps to track foreign fighters who travel in and out of Syria.'

In a 
segment with King on CBS' Face the Nation news program on Sunday 
morning, Rep. Adam Smith, a Democrat and the ranking member on the House
 Armed Services Committee, reiterated that 'there's no evidence at this 
point,' that ISIS is planning specific attacks against 'Western targets 
like Al Qaeda was...almost a decade before 9/11.'

'These
 groups, they don't need an excuse, they will attack us whenever they 
can,' King countered. 'The longer we wait, the more dangerous ISIS 
becomes.'

House Intelligence Committee Chairman Mike Rogers voiced similar concerns on Fox News Sunday.

'I'm very concerned because we don't know every single person who has gone and trained and learned how to fight,' he said.

Britain's Prime Minister David Cameron walks to Parliament on Monday. Cameron announced new legislation this afternoon that would give police the 'temporary' power to 'seize passports' of suspected terrorists

Cameron 
drew praise from King over the weekend for his aggressive actions to 
prevent terrorism after receiving bad press in his own country the week 
before for not making the issue his first priority.

Like
 President Barack Obama, Cameron was on vacation when radicals murdered 
American journalist James Foley. Cameron rushed back to London after 
spending just one day on summer holiday. However, he stayed for less 
than 24 hours before returning to his vacation spot in Cornwall.

After Cameron permanently returned to London last week he raised the terror threat level and hinted that the government would take additional precautions to prevent radicals from reentering the country.

On Monday afternoon Cameron announced new legislation that would provide his country's police with the 'temporary power to seize a passport at the border' if the government suspects the carrier of having terrorist ties.

'Passports are not an automatic right,' he said in a speech before the House of Commons.

'It's abhorrent that people who declare their allegiance elsewhere are 
able to return to the United Kingdom and pose a threat to our national 
security,' he told Parliament.
