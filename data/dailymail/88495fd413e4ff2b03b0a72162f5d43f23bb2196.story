The father of missing chef Claudia 
Lawrence has said not knowing what happened to his daughter five years 
after she disappeared is like a cancer eating away at him.

Peter Lawrence, was speaking as he and his family marked the fifth anniversary of their daughter’s disappearance from the Heworth area of the city of York.

Miss
 Lawrence was 35 when she failed to turn up for work at York
 University on March 19, 2009, prompting a huge police 
search and high-profile campaign to find her that has so far had no results.

Torture: Peter Lawrence (right), was speaking as he and his family marked the fifth anniversary of the disappearance of their daughter Claudia (left). He compared not knowing what happened to her to 'a cancer'

Mr
 Lawrence said his family had been 'tortured' by not knowing what had 
happened to his daughter but said he has faith in a new investigation 
launched by North Yorkshire Police last year.

New
 information from the investigation team is expected to be released 
tomorrow to coincide with a BBC Crimewatch appeal about Miss Lawrence.

Speaking
 at a press conference in York, Mr Lawrence said: 'No one knows, unless 
they’re in the same position as us, what it means every day and, in 
fact, most nights - wondering, worrying, 'where are you Claudia, are you
 safe, is someone holding you, have you been hurt?' Even, of course, 
'are you alive?'.'

18 MARCH 2009

5.57am: Claudia Lawrence is seen on CCTV arriving for work at Goodricke College, York.

2.31pm: She leaves work to walk the three miles to her home in Heworth Road.

3.05pm: The last sighting of Miss Lawrence as she nears her home.

8.10pm: Miss Lawrence speaks to her father on the phone. Shortly after she calls her mother.

8.23pm: She sends a text message to a friend.

9.12pm: Miss Lawrence receives text message from a bar worker in Cyprus. She does not reply.

19 MARCH 2009

6am: Miss Lawrence fails to arrive for her shift at Goodricke College.

Daytime: At some point, her mobile phone is either switched off or runs out of battery.

Evening: Miss Lawrence fails to meet her friend Suzy Cooper. After finding out Miss Lawrence also did not turn up for work, Ms Cooper calls Mr Lawrence, who then calls North Yorkshire Police.

Night: The police search for Miss Lawrence begins.

'It’s now 
five years, which is over 1,800 of those days and nights. It is an 
awfully long time for anyone to be in this position. And it eats into 
you.'

'It's actually like a 
cancer and it just gets worse and worse because there’s no resolution 
until we know what happened to Claudia.'

Miss Lawrence’s disappearance prompted a massive police investigation involving up to 100 officers, but the inquiry was scaled back after all leads failed to locate her.

Last
 October, following the setting up of a new major crime unit at North 
Yorkshire Police, the investigation was relaunched, starting with a new 
detailed forensic examination of Miss Lawrence’s house in the Heworth 
area of York.

The chef was 
last seen by work colleagues on Wednesday March 18 2009, when she 
finished for the day. She spoke to both her parents on the phone later 
that night, with everything appearing to be normal.

Her
 father believes she spent the night of March 18 at the house, where she lived alone, and 
something happened to her after she set off for work the next morning.

The
 new investigation team is expected to release more information tomorrow
 but Mr Lawrence said he did not want to pre-empt the police’s 
announcement.

He said he thought it was 'sickening' someone out there knew what had happened to Miss Lawrence but had not come forward.

Mr Lawrence said: 'Please, please do realise what it is doing to us. It just eats into you like a hole and it’s a torture.'

He
 said he still believes his daughter is alive, citing the example of 
three women in Cleveland, in the United States, found last year after 
being held captive for 10 years as cause for hope.
