A woman has been accused of aborting her unborn baby boy after a dead fetus was found dumped in a New York residential rubbish bin.

Yaribely Almonte, 20, has become one of only a handful of people in the city to ever be charged with the offence, following the gruesome discovery in Washington Heights, Manhattan.

A superintendent found the seven-inch long foetus, which still had the umbilical cord attached, on Tuesday night while tying up a garbage bag.

Charged: A woman was arrested in Washington Heights on suspicion she had self-aborted her unborn baby boy

He said: 'When I found the baby, I didn’t know if it was real at first. It was so bad. After that happened, I just stayed in my apartment for a while because I didn’t feel well.'

Police have now charged Almonte, who reportedly rented a room in the building at 191st Street and Wadsworth Avenue for only a short while before moving out, with self-abortion in the first degree.

Although it is not known how old the foetus was, the charge is only used when the abortion occurs after 24 weeks of pregnancy.

After that point, it is legal only if a woman's doctor says her life is in danger.

The superintendent, who did not want to be named, told the New York Times that the suspect was 'not very talkative'. He also believed she had dropped out of school a few years ago.

Experts have previously said home abortions are a phenomenon in Latin American cultures, maybe because of a lack of insurance or because of a mistrust of the medical system.

This was despite the widespread availability of safe, legal abortions in New York City. They often used medications like misoprostol or herbal concoctions

Elizabeth Toledo, a public relations consultant for abortion rights groups, said: 'It's been well discussed in the Latino community that there’s an issue about health and safety and the use of medication outside of a doctor’s care for pregnancy termination.'

Almonte was released and will return to court on January 3.

Greg Pfundstein, executive director of the Chiaroscuro Foundation, an anti-abortion group, said: 'This woman has my sympathy. This appears to be a clear case of desperation.

'I wish she had known there are people who would have helped her through this, including the New York Catholic Archdiocese.'

In the last 30 years, only four other women have been charged with self-abortion in New York, according to the state's Division of Criminal Justice Services.
