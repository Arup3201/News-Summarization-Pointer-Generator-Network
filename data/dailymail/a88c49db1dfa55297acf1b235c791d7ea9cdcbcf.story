A Tennessee family of devout evangelical Christian asylum-seekers who face deportation to their native Germany has reached a milestone in their quest to remain in the United States, now that their petition on the White House's website collected more than 100,000 signatures in less than 30 days.

That's the magic number that the Obama administration says will trigger an official review and a formal response. The total currently stands are more than 111,000.

'Every
 state in the United States of America recognizes the right to 
homeschool,' reads the petition filed by the Home School Legal Defense Association (HSLDA), 'and the U.S. has the world’s largest 
and most vibrant homeschool community. Regrettably, this family faces 
deportation in spite of the persecution they will suffer in Germany.'

That group sued the Department of Justice after a judge in the DOJ's Executive Office for Immigration Review ruled that Uwe and Hannelore Romeike's earlier grant of asylum should be revoked.

School day: The Romeikes have six children and another on the way. They are seen here demonstrating how homeschooling works in their Morristown, Tennessee home

Danger: Their native Germany does not allow children to be home-schooled and allows the revocation of custody in some cases

An estimated 2 million children in the US are home schooled, including the five out of six of the Romeikes' children who are school-age. Hannelore Romeike is pregnant and expecting her seventh child in June.

But
 the practice of teaching children at home instead of in government-run schools is illegal in Germany. An estimated 200 families teach 
their own children there anyway, even at the risk of fines, criminal 
prosecution and, in some cases, the loss of custody of their children.

'The public expects the White House to explain the inexplicable,' said the HSLDA's Michael Farris. 'In a season where the Administration has expressed leniency for millions of undocumented immigrants, we are baffled by the extreme attitudes toward this one German family.'

Uwe Romeike appeared on the Mike Huckabee Show on the Fox News Channel, saying about the petition that 'the most important thing about this is that the government sees that not only are we interested in getting asylum, but the American people in general stand behind this case.'

'It’s all about freedom for parents to decide on their children’s education,' he said.

Focus on the Romeikes: The family appeared on Mike Huckabee's Fox News program. They became a favorite cause of may conservatives in recent weeks

Popular: Claiming persecution in Germany, the Romeikes petitioned the White House and received over 100,000 online signatures, but that didn't sway the circuit court's interpretation of asylum law

But Professor David Abraham of the University of Miami Law School argued Friday on Fox that home-schooling isn't a basic human right, and that the Romeike family isn't entitled to stay in the United States.

'Home schooling may be a good idea. It may be a bad idea. It's a public policy question,' Abraham said.

'Not having home schooling is not being persecuted. Asylum is about persecution.'

'They are not getting something they would like,' he insisted. "that's true for people everywhere, and that's why we have legislatures.'

Professor David Abraham from the University of Miami Law School (L) says the family isn't entitled to political asylum just because the German government has criminalized homeschooling. Their children's curriculum includes math, science and other typical school subjects

The 'We The People' petition system was a creation of the Obama administration. In its original form, petitioners were required to collect 5,000 signatures to guarantee a White House response. That cutoff was quickly raised to 25,000.

The administration raised the bar again, to require 100,000 signatures, in December.

Fighting: Hannelore Romeike supervises one of her daughters during a home-schooling session. The Romeikes are say they plan to appeal today's Circuit Court decision to deny them asylum
