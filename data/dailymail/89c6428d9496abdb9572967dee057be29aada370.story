A Syrian religious group have banned croissants because they symbolise western oppression.

A Sharia committee issued a fatwa, or religious ruling, declaring croissants ‘haram’, which means they are forbidden in Islamic law.

The group, which operates in a rebel-held area of Aleppo, said that they have ‘colonial’ significance.

They claim that the pastry’s crescent shape celebrates European victory over Muslims, reported Al Arabiya.

Islamis sharia committees have declared several strict fatwas in rebel-controlled areas of Syria.

Aleppo’s society usually adheres to moderate Islamic teachings.

A fatwa was issued on Facebook prohibiting ‘Muslim women wearing makeup and tight clothes that reveal physical features from going out.’

Another, issued by the Council of the United Judiciary, gave a year in jail for those not fasting during Ramadan.

Member of the opposition Syrian National Coalition Samir Nashar said there are civil movements resisting the extremist tendencies of such committees.

He also told Asharq al-Awsat that the FSA should unite its forces in Aleppo and work to prevent the expansion of these committees.
