The Prime Minister will say that fracking will attract firms to move posts back to the UK and make Britain the ¿re-shore nation¿

Cheap energy from shale gas will help fuel a trend that is seeking thousands of British jobs shifted to low-cost countries in the East brought back home, David Cameron will declare today.

The Prime Minister will say that fracking, coupled with cuts to business taxes and red tape, will attract firms to move posts back to the UK and make Britain the ‘re-shore nation’.

According to Government figures, some 1,500 manufacturing jobs have already come back to the UK since 2011, while major companies are also reopening call centres previously shifted to countries such as India and the Philippines.

Experts say various factors are driving the trend, including companies wanting to improve quality, shorten lead time and improve delivery performance.

As middle classes expand and wages rise in emerging economies such as China, there is also a narrowing advantage in terms of costs.

Speaking to the World Economic Forum in Swiss ski resort Davos, the Prime Minister will acknowledge that companies are certain to continue moving production facilities to countries like India and China in the years to come, but he will insist that the West should not be ‘written off’.

Citing recent research which found that one in ten small and medium-sized businesses have brought production back to the UK over the last year - twice as many as have sent it abroad - he will say that reshoring could become ‘a fresh driver of growth in Europe’ and Britain should take advantage of the trend.

‘For years the West has been written off,’ Mr Cameron is expected to say. ‘People say that we are facing some sort of inevitable decline. They say we can’t make anything any more.

‘Whether it’s the shift from manufacturing to services or the transfer from manual jobs to machines, the end point is the same dystopian vision - the East wins while the West loses; and the workers lose while the machines win.

‘I don’t believe it has to be this way.

‘Of course, we cannot be starry eyed about globalisation - it presents huge challenges as our economies and societies try to adapt. But neither should we take this pessimistic view.

The Prime Minister will suggest that governments can encourage the trend by acting to ensure supplies of cheap energy

‘Indeed if we make the right decisions, we may also see more of what has been a small but discernible trend where some jobs that were once offshored are coming back from East to West.’ 

The Prime Minister will suggest that governments can encourage the trend by acting to ensure supplies of cheap energy.

Business Secretary Vince Cable said: ¿British industry is coming home'

‘There is no doubt that when it comes to re-shoring in the US, one of the most important factors has been the development of shale gas which is flooring US energy prices with billions of dollars of energy cost savings predicted over the next decade,’ he is expected to say.

‘Taken together, I believe these trends have the ability to be a fresh driver of growth in Europe too. I want Britain to seize these opportunities. I think there is a chance for Britain to become the ‘re-shore nation’.’ 

Before flying out to Davos, Mr Cameron visited ventilation and heating equipment manufacturers Vent-Axia, which has recently moved production from China to Crawley, in West Sussex.

Other companies which have brought jobs back to the UK include food manufacturer Symington’s, which is moving its factory from China to Leeds, model train firm Hornby, which is shifting some manufacturing from India to Britain, computer company Raspberry Pi, which has moved production to Wales, and fashion brand Jaeger which is bringing as much as 10% of its manufacturing back to Britain after a 15-year absence, said Downing Street.

Business Secretary Vince Cable said: ‘British industry is coming home.

'Over the last few months I have welcomed many companies who have taken manufacturing, textiles, call centre work or software abroad, bringing jobs back to the UK.

'This is a sign that diverse, high-quality British manufacturing is on the rise once again.

‘It also highlights the ability of British-based business to stand strong in the face of global competition.’ 

Labour’s shadow business secretary Chuka Umunna said: ‘David Cameron and George Osborne have failed to deliver the stronger, balanced recovery we need to see.

‘The Tory-led government came to office promising an export-led recovery but the UK’s trade deficit is growing. Any help for manufacturers is welcome after three damaging years of flatlining and in a month where factory orders have fallen back.

'But after so many Government schemes have failed to deliver for business, manufacturers will want to see what this one offers in practice.

‘Labour would create a proper British Investment Bank supported by a network of regional banks, a skills system which delivers for businesses of all sizes and would cut business rates to help growing firms.’
