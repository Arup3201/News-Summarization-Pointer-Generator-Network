Sportsmail continues to review the candidates for William Hill's Sports Book of the Year award for 2014. Here CHRIS WAUGH looks at the autobiography of former Wales and Lions star Gareth Thomas, who is one of the most high-profile sports stars to make public that he is gay.  

Author: Gareth Thomas and Michael Calvin

Publisher: Ebury Press

Rating: 4.5/5

‘My suicide would be measured, civilised. I would gradually become incapable, and slip gently into the water... So much for the fantasy fatality... I couldn’t follow it through.’

When an autobiography opens up with a chapter about one of the numerous times a Welsh rugby icon tried to kill himself due to a burning secret he felt he couldn’t reveal to society, you know that you are in for a hard-hitting read.

Yet somehow, despite learning of the struggles Thomas has been through in his personal and professional life, you do not find yourself downhearted. Instead, Proud is captivating, revealing and simply brilliant to read. It is also about so much more than a person’s sexuality, because that is not the only thing which defines them.

Gareth Thomas has written his autobiography, giving insight into his rugby career and personal battles

Thomas racked up a breathtaking 40 tries in 100 caps for Wales’s rugby union side, including more than 50 as captain. He represented the British and Irish Lions in three Tests, captaining them in two of those. He played for Bridgend, Pontypridd, Cardiff, Celtic Warriors, Toulouse and Cardiff Blues during a stellar professional career before converting to rugby league and representing the Crusaders and his home nation of Wales on four occasions. He is a deep and fascinating person, one who gives a unique insight into what it is like to captain one of the world’s finest sides.

The dark moments of Thomas’s life reveal so much about a complicated character. He is not your archetypal sportsman who lives his very public persona – Thomas admits in his book in fact that, until he came out in 2009, he lived a dual life.

Publicly, Thomas was ‘Alfie’ – a man’s man, who ‘loved the craic. He drank to excess, picked fights in pubs, and played to the gallery by rampaging around town in a range of fancy-dress masks.’ But privately, he was holding back a secret, one he felt he could not reveal to the world. The Welsh rugby captain was gay, but did not believe he could be accepted in the hyper-masculine world of professional sport as such.

It was that secret which led Thomas to try and drown himself in his swimming pool at his home in Toulouse, where he played between 2004 and 2007. It was that secret which compelled Thomas to stand on a cliff edge in south Wales, to remove all his clothes and come within an inch of jumping to his death.

However, when it comes to rugby, Thomas gives a unique insight that only a man who has played in such high-profile games as he could. Explaining that when he captained Wales he was ‘nothing without the team,’ he goes through his leadership style and reveals how to skipper a side to Grand Slam glory. It is fascinating and something all rugby fans should endeavour to read.

Proud is up there with the most honest books I have ever picked up. Thomas regularly admits to self-loathing throughout his life; to cheating on his wife while on trips to the gay scene in London to ‘satisfy’ his urges and keep his secret hidden; to turning to drink to hide his inner-battle with himself; and to being a ‘dreadful’ husband. What’s more, this is not an account for which Thomas wants pity – he is just being brutally honest. He knows the mistakes he has made, but he is also aware of the pressures and expectations put upon the captain of a rugby-mad nation.

Admitting that the brutal reaction of Castleford rugby league fans to his homosexuality in March 2010  was the ‘manifestation of the worst nightmare imaginable’, Thomas in some ways proves he was vindicated in keeping his sexuality secret. The world has moved on an awful lot since homosexuality was deemed unacceptable, but unfortunately there are still some out there who cannot accept people for what they are.

Thomas consistently states that he is no ‘hero’ for 'coming out' – but he is most certainly a trailblazer at the very least. The first few professional sportspeople to do so will always be the bravest individuals and will always face the most difficult task, and it is for that reason that Proud can be an inspiration to all homosexual athletes.

The Welshman has been to hell and back because of his previously hidden sexuality, but he reveals a sense of an inner peace now that his secret is so public.

It was extremely difficult, excruciatingly painful and took him many years to find – yet Thomas is now at one with himself. He knows who he is, and he is proud of that, something which comes across eloquently on every single page.

This book is as inspiring as it is moving and depressing. A must read and, as brilliant as I imagine the other nominees must be, I would be gobsmacked if this did not pick up the William Hill Sports Book of the Year award. It is breathtaking.

Look out for reviews of the other books in the running for the award thoughout this week.
