In the weeks to come, it would be something special if it was Germany's turn to drool over Roy Hodgson's audacious decision to take the kids to a World Cup.

Back in 2010, when Germany humbled England 4-1 in the second round, it felt like a young man's tournament.

Three of Joachim Low's forwards - Sami Khedira (23), Mesut Ozil (21) and Thomas Muller (20) - danced around Matthew Upson and John Terry at the Free State Stadium in Bloemfontein. 

Aged 20, Toni Kroos, now regarded as one of the best midfielders in the game, was on the substitutes' bench. Manuel Neuer (24), Philipp Lahm (26), Jerome Boateng (21), Per Mertesacker (25) taught England a lesson in possession.

It was shock and awe. They played without fear of reprisal, shredding Matthew Upson to pieces during an extraordinary afternoon for English football. Muller, who was later named the best young player at the tournament, scored twice.

Roy Hodgson will not be quite as cavalier, but it would be special if Raheem Sterling, Jack Wilshere, Daniel Sturridge, Luke Shaw and, hopefully, Alex Oxlade-Chamberlain returned to similar acclaim.

We know they have the talent, particularly after outstanding seasons with their clubs. Now they have to make it happen and turn it to their advantage at the world's biggest football tournament.

Many England fans are scarred by the performance under Fabio Capello four years ago and it is easy to forget what happened next to Low's breathtaking team.

A few days later Germany played even better when they destroyed Argentina 4-0 in the quarter-final with one of the most devastating performances in the history of the World Cup. In the semi-final, those young legs ran out of steam against the eventual champions, Spain.

In the build up to this year's World Cup, they have been talking with some conviction about winning it for a fourth time. 

Low and his players really believe they can emulate the achievements of Sepp Herberger (1954), Helmut Schon (1974) and Franz Beckenbauer (1990).

They have a rich history at the World Cup, winning three and losing four finals. They seem certain they will reach another.

A few days ago Low, Germany's charismatic coach, was pictured counting four fingers in recognition of the target. It was a bold thing to agree to do and not something you would expect to see from England's head coach Hodgson.

On song: Germany's brilliant victory was one of the most devastating in the history of the World Cup

Last week Andre Schurrle spoke of the expectancy in Germany and the demand to win another World Cup. It feels like their time is coming. With Bastian Schweinsteiger, Sven Bender, Lars Bender, Khedira and Kroos competing for a place in their midfield, they are a formidable team.

Germany have improved. A World Cup in Brazil is a true test for a team's life cycle, particularly for any European team. Let's not forget that Spain, the reigning world and European champions, were beaten 3-0 by Brazil in last summer's Confederations Cup final in the Maracana. But Germany have an outstanding group of players and have had time to mature since 2010. 

They had another semi-final at Euro 2012, before they were beaten by Italy. The current crop already have course and distance.

Hodgson has dipped his toe in the water with his squad, reaching out for some younger players as part of a plan to protect the future of the England team.

The head coach hasn't been quite as cavalier, but it is to be hoped that the younger players can still cause something of a stir against Italy on Saturday.

Hodgson is realistic enough to know that the Manaus heat - it was 35 degrees celsius on Tuesday without taking into the account the humidity - will be a huge factor. He cannot realistically expect Steven Gerrard, at 34, to make those lung-busting runs up and down the field in the opening game.

Instead the captain will be patrolling in front of the back four and asked to conserve energy and use his experience to bring some of the younger members of the squad in to play.

Hodgson's plan is to win the ball back and then make sure that Gerrard and Henderson give it to fresh young legs who can make an impact in the final third. It is sensible planning.

They are in a tough pool of teams, but Germany lost one of their group games back in 2010 and it didn't hurt them.

England's warm-up matches are no great indicators and it is far too early to start talking about the revolution of English football. For once, though, it would be nice to talk about a revelation.

Now it's up to Raheem Sterling, Ross Barkley and Co to emulate that side
