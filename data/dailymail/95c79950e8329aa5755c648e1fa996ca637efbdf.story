Increasing numbers of iPhone and iPad users are being targeted by hackers who are remotely locking their devices and demanding ransom money in return.

Ransomware attacks, in which criminals remotely gain access to a device and hold it hostage, aren’t new, but they have traditionally targeted laptops and PCs.

In this latest mobile attack, the hackers are controlling gadgets by breaking into customers' iCloud accounts and remotely locking the devices using the Find My iPhone feature.

The alleged ransomware attacks are thought to have originated in Australia, but reports have also been spotted worldwide. Hackers are accessing users' iCloud accounts, stock image pictured, to enable the Find My iPhone feature and remotely get access to any connected devices

Find My iPhone helps users locate and protect their  iPhone, iPad, iPod touch, or Mac - if it’s ever lost or stolen.

With 
Find My iPhone set up on a device, it locates a device on a map, can play a sound to help users find their phone, use Lost Mode to lock and track it, or remotely delete all personal information.

With
 iOS 7 or later, Find My iPhone includes a feature called Activation
 Lock, which is turned on automatically when Find My iPhone is switched on.

Activation Lock makes it harder for anyone to use or sell an iPhone, 
iPad, or iPod touch if it’s lost or stolen.

With Activation Lock, the Apple ID and password are required before anyone can disable Find My iPhone, sign out of iCloud, or erase and reactivate the device.

The attacks began last week in Australia, but customers from across the globe have reported the hack on official Apple support forums and tech sites.

Based on these reports, criminals are hacking into iCloud accounts from a browser, before locating connected devices using the Find My iPhone feature.

In some instances, customers have multiple Apple products including iPhones, iPads, iPods and Macs attached to the same account.

The hackers, operating under the name 'Oleg Pliss', are then enabling Lock Mode to shut the devices down remotely.

This feature lets people send messages to thieves, for example, letting them know that the phone has been locked.

In this instance, hackers are personalising these messages to demand $100 in ransom money to release the devices.

The hack only works on handsets that have the Find My iPhone feature switched on, and this is accessible in Settings.

Apple told the MailOnline: ‘Apple takes security very seriously and iCloud was not compromised during this incident.

Ransomware is a type of malware that infects a system and prevents the owner from getting access to it.

Hackers then demand ransom money for the restriction to be removed. 

Some forms of ransomware encrypt files on the hard drive, while others lock the system.

The malware is usually installed as a trojan, via a downloaded file or security flaw in a program or network.

In June last year, security firm McAfee said it collected more than 250,000 unique samples of ransomware in the first quarter - double the number it obtained during the same period the year before.

‘Impacted users should change their Apple ID password as soon as possible and avoid using the same user name and password for multiple services. 

'Any users who need additional help can contact AppleCare or visit their local Apple Retail Store.’

To change an Apple ID, go to appleid.apple.com and follow the steps to 
reset the password.

Users that have a passcode on their iOS devices can remove Lost Mode in Settings, using this PIN.

Although the attacks began last week, they show no signs of stopping.

They appear to be scam in which hackers are stealing details from other websites and using the same login details to access as many accounts as possible - including iCloud.

It highlights, again, the need to have different login details for different accounts.
