Kelly Atkinson was devastated when she was diagnosed with Hodgkin's Lymphoma two years ago.

As if having cancer wasn't enough, the illness saw the 27-year-old pile on the pounds leaving Kelly's self-esteem at an all time low. 

However, Kelly is now unrecognisable after fitness sessions left her with more energy than ever before. 

Kelly Atkinson started to pile on the pounds after recieving treatment for her cancer but since training with her fitness godfather, Kelly has slimmed down to her normal size 

Kelly, a customer service worker from Prescot, Merseyside, was diagnosed with cancer two years ago which saw her gain weight as she received treatment for the illness.

In a desperate bid to battle her bulge as well as her illness, Kelly turned to a personal trainer known as the 'fitness godfather' Kevin Woods, 24 and she now claims that it was the best decision of her life.

Kevin put Kelly through a grueling training regime and made her swap her calorie-laden diet of takeaways in favour of his nutrition programme.

Kevin's regime is trying but it provided Kelly with the results she needed in order to get back to her normal self.

At her largest Kelly was a size 20 after her illness left her with low energy levels that kept her in bed 

Kelly was determined to lose the weight she had gained during her treatment, dedicating herself completely to Kevin's strict regime 

In just six months Kelly lost over 3st and has now dropped from a size 20 to a svelte size 10 and says that she has Kevin to thank for her new body and for her new found confidence. 

Having cancer was difficult enough without the weight gain, however Kelly says that Kevin has helped her find a whole new lease of life. 

'It was absolutely devastating to hear that I had cancer - I have never felt so down in all my life.

'I was on all kinds of steroids and I spent most of my days in bed so naturally my weight shot up. I felt so lethargic and I never had any energy.

Kelly refers to Kevin (left) as a 'fitness God' and says that he has changed her life

Kevin's strict regime saw Kelly lose 3st in only six months

As well as training, Kelly swapped her calorie-laden diet for a low fat, protein filled plan

'I knew I had to do something about it so I joined Kevin's class and from day one I knew it was the best decision of my life.'

Kelly says that she noticed a difference very early on which kept her motivated to continue with Kevin's regime. 

'He's like a fitness god - everything from training to my diet changed and I felt the benefits in no time.

'I lost around a stone in the first month alone and with constant motivation from Kevin I was able to keep on digging deep to get back in shape.'  

Kevin says that Kelly's story is truly inspirational and that he hopes others will follow in her footsteps

Kelly says she has never felt more energised and says she plans to continue with Kevin's plan 

As well as her body transformation, Kelly has received positive news regarding her cancer as she is currently in remission and is desperately awaiting to be given the all-clear from the cancer after two years of treatment.

Although she has shrunk back down to her normal size, Kelly is determined to make the routine part of her weekly regime. 

She works up a sweat at an hourly boot camp session around three times a week and performs her own workout routine at home twice a week.

Kelly, who dropped from 13st 8lbs to 10st 5lbs, is now helping others get into shape by passing on advice given by Kevin and sharing her experience of battling cancer.

She hopes that her story can inspire others to make a transformation and says that she has never felt better. 

Kelly is now in remission and is awaiting the all-clear 

'I've got so much energy now - it feels amazing. My body needed it - I was really struggling to do anything but Kevin has helped me turn my life around.

'I just want to pass on my experiences with other people and help them in any way I can.'

Kevin, from Whiston, Merseyside, worked as a football coach in the USA for two years but returned home in 2012 to become a full-time health coach.

He is now hoping to transform the lives of others who want to tone up after passing on his secrets to friends and family members.

Kevin says that helping Kelly was incredibly rewarding and that he hopes that many more will follow in her footsteps.  

'I do a lot of boot camp classes at the local gym but with other people I'll visit them at home and give them a class there.

'It's incredibly satisfying when someone thanks you for helping them get into shape and feel fit and healthy.

'Kelly's story is just incredible - she's a real fighter. She's now helping others to do the same which is a fantastic feeling.'

Kelly added that her body transformation has reminded her not to give up hope and has kept her optimistic for her future. 

'No matter what happens in life you can always fight back - it's never too late to do anything.'
