Sacrifice: Plamen Petkov, 32, died after diving into the sea after a mother cried for help to rescue her daughter

The devastated family of a hero who drowned at sea saving the life of a five-year-old girl have spoken of their immense pride.

Plamen Petkov, 32, had been on a day out to the beach with a friend on Saturday at West Wittering, West Sussex when tragedy struck.

His family said he rushed to the help of a mother who was shouting for help because her daughter was drifting out to sea on an inflatable ring.

They said Mr Petkov - a British Citizen of Bulgarian origin - dived into the water ‘without second thoughts’, followed by his friend and another woman from Guildford, Surrey.

But the hero, who was not related to the 
youngster, had a suspected heart attack and drowned just 16ft from the shore 
moments after delivering the unharmed child to safety.

Shocked beachgogers attempted to save his life using CPR for 40 minutes before an air ambulance arrived.

The family of Mr Petkov, an electrician who lived in Sutton, Surrey, said they welcomed calls by members of the public to award him with a posthumous honour for his bravery.

In a statement they said: ‘We are all incredibly sad to have lost such a special person from our lives but we are also immensely proud that Plamen was able to save the life of this young child.

‘His display of concern for others was typical of the man we all knew and the way he lived his life.

‘Plamen always made time to help others, and as a family we have all been touched by his kindness and generosity which he displayed each day.

‘We are grateful for the messages of support from everyone Plamen came into contact with both in and out of work - he leaves a huge gap in our lives and will be missed by us all.

‘We would like to thank his friend and the woman for the huge effort they made to try to save Plamen’s life and to people for the kind comments made about Plamen and his part in returning the child safely to the shore.

‘In response to the many people who 
have been moved by his brave act, the family would like to release his 
name and picture to be commemorated.

‘We also appreciate suggestions to award Plamen with a posthumous honour for his actions.’

The
family have also called for stationed lifeguards on beaches with 
dangerous waters to prevent similar tragedies in the future.

In
their statement they added: ‘In these extremely difficult days, 
Plamen’s family want to use this unfortunate opportunity to stress their
concern with the dangerous waters like those at West Wittering around 
the UK coast and are keen to call for additional positive safety 
measures to be put in place, such as stationed lifeguards, and to not 
just rely on signage in order to prevent future tragedies of a similar 
nature occurring again.

‘The
family are looking at how they might support the local community in 
this area who share this concern in the hope that these changes might be
an appropriate way of honouring Plamen’s name and courageous act.’

The family issued their own version of events in the statement

They
said when Plamen reached the child, she jumped from the inflatable into
the arms of Plamen - who by this point was exhausted and trying to keep
the child’s head above water.

The man, who was not related to the youngster, had a heart attack and drowned just 16ft from the shore in West Sussex

They
said Plamen’s friend was next to reach them. By this point Plamen was 
holding the child above the water as he was being dragged under by the 
current and his friend tried to pull him to the surface and helped to 
support the child until the women arrived and took the child and swam 
with her to the shore while Plamen’s friend brought him to the shore 
unconscious.

The family added when they arrived at the shore the woman started the attempt to resuscitate him with CPR until help arrived.

The
family say the attempt continued for around 40 minutes until an air 
ambulance arrived but they were unfortunately unable to save him.

Plamen worked for Vulcan Building Services, based in Sutton, Surrey.

Staff at the firm have been left stunned by his death and have been comforting his family.

A
company spokesman said: ‘Plamen was an extremely conscientious and 
hardworking person, who was universally liked and respected by both his 
workmates and clients alike.

‘He
had always shown himself to be a thoughtful and caring man and while 
the news of his death came as a terrible shock for everyone at the 
company, the fact he tragically lost his life in a completely selfless 
act to try and help somebody in trouble came as no surprise at all.

‘It was so typical of a person who had become a friend as well as a colleague to all of us, and he will be very sadly missed.’

The
spokesman added: ‘His actions are an outstanding example of what true 
heroism is all about; ordinary people doing amazing things to help 
others in trouble or less fortunate than themselves, without any thought
of the dangers involved and expecting nothing in return.

‘Unfortunately
for his family, friends and colleagues, Plamen has paid the highest 
possible price for his bravery and the world is much poorer for his 
passing.

‘Every member of staff would like to pass on their sincere and heartfelt condolences to his family at such a very sad time.’
