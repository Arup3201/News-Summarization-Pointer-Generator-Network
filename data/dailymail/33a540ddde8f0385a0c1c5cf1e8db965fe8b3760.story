After Manchester United held on to beat Stoke City on Tuesday night, the players and manager alike insisted that the result, rather than the identity of the goalscorers, was what mattered.

But for Marcos Rojo's girlfriend Eugenia Lusardo, it was important to prove that her man, rather than Juan Mata, had scored the vital goal.

The model posted a picture of Rojo appearing to get a touch on Mata's cross to her Instagram account on Tuesday night.

The ball snuck in at Asmir Begovic's far post after Rojo's slightest touch to give United the lead

Lusardo added the message 'Nothing more to say! Haha I love you'.

Mata, who celebrated the goal on the pitch, had earlier refused to say whether it was he who had scored, claiming he would have to check later.

But Louis van Gaal suggested it had been the Spanish midfielder, rather than Rojo, who was responsible for United's winner.

Lusardo was adamant that her boyfriend had scored the goal, posting that there was 'Nothing more to say'

Juan Mata was congratulated for the goal on the pitch, but it appears Rojo actually got the last touch
