For some it’s a hard trot life, but not for this 15-month-old micro pig who, with a diamante collar and selection of miniature t-shirts, could be Britain’s most spoiled porker.

Dotty, who weighs two stone and is the same size as a small dog, sports a pink collar encrusted with diamantes spelling out her name, enjoys regular cuddles and even goes to work with her owner so she doesn’t get bored.

The pampered pig, who belongs to Kelly and Roger Dommett, has even become a local celebrity in her hometown of Pontypridd, South Wales where passers-by often stop by to ‘say hello’.

Kelly Dommett takes her beloved 15-month-old micro pig Dotty to work with her at Jet Away Travel Agency  in Pontypridd, South Wales, every day and the animal is regularly visited by customers and passers-by

Mrs Dommett, who takes her beloved pet to work with her at travel agency Jet Away every day, said the animal loves the attention from colleagues and customers.

She said: ‘She comes on the commute with me in the car and then I put her on a lead and walk her to the office.

‘People are always surprised when they see her and come over to make a fuss of her.

‘Dotty has become one of the family in the office - everyone loves her.

‘She is definitely not a farmyard animal, I don’t even think she could live outside.’

As well as her diamante collar, the black and white pig also has her own selection of t-shirts including several pink ones emblazoned with nicknames.

Mrs Dommett, who has given Dotty her 
own space in the office where visitors can give her a cuddle, claims she
 is the perfect pet - and colleague - describing her as ‘extremely laid 
back, clean and odourless’.

She said: ‘I don’t know what I would do without Dotty.

‘She’s like a dog, following me around, she comes to her name and does tricks, such as standing on her back legs, in return for grapes.

‘I never thought we would end up getting a pig, but I gave into Roger and I’m so glad I did.’

Micro pigs, which are intelligent creatures who crave companionship, have the potential to live up to 25 years meaning Dotty could have several more years of celebrity status before venturing into retirement.
