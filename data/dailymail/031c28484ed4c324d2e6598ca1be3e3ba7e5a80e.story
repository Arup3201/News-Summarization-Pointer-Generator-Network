House Speaker John Boehner today admitted there is no easy way to stop the budget cuts dashing hopes for millions of Americans.

The cuts, also called the 'sequester' began to take effect on Friday night.

In an interview this morning with NBC’s Meet the Press, Mr Boehner said he wasn't sure how Washington could solve the fiscal problems that have dominated the country's politics for more than two years and he also suggested that he's not sure where the debate goes from here

Now what? House Speaker John Boehner says there is no easy way to stop the "sequester" budget cuts that took effect Friday night

'I don't think anyone quite understands how it gets resolved,' Mr Boehner admitted during his interview with NBC’s David Gregory.

President Obama and officials within his administration had warned of consequences for national security and government services if the sequester went ahead.  

Mr Obama has suggested new tax increases to avoid the cuts but Mr Boehner and his fellow Republicans have said that such a deal is not on the cards.

Both the Republican and Democrat parties are agreed on one thing: neither wants the spending cuts to continue. Yet they've been unable to reach any agreement on an alternative measure.

Where do we go from here? Both Republicans & Democrats are agreed on one thing - neither wants the spending cuts to continue... but they can't agree how to resolve the issues

Mr Boehner insists that the President should look at spending instead of attempting to push through new tax inceases.

'Every American, in these tough economic times, has to find a way to balance their budget. They've got to make choices,' Mr Boehner said. 'They expect Washington to live within its means and to make choices as well and it's time for the president and Senate Democrats to get serious about the long-term spending problem that we have.'

Mr Boehner, who met March 1 with Obama and other congressional leaders, blamed Democrats for the impasse over the 'silly' cuts. He also said Republicans will hold firm in their demands for cuts in entitlement spending.

Facing public scrutiny: Neither side looks particularly good from the sequester fight but Republicans are very supportive of Speaker John Boehner's tough approach and his refusal to negotiate

President Obama cast blame on Congress for failing to avoid the sequester cuts

'I’ve been here for 22 years' and 'I’ve watched leaders from both parties kick this can down the road,' he
said. 'We’re out of road to kick the can down. We’ve got a long-term 
spending problem that has to be addressed.’

At the same time, Mr 
Boehner said Republicans have no interest in shuttering the government 
later this month when Congress will have to approve budget legislation 
to keep federal agencies running beyond March 27.

'We should not 
have any talk of a government shutdown so I’m hopeful that the House and
Senate will be able to work through this,' he said. 

Mr 
Obama has demanded that any plan to replace the sequester must include 
new tax increases, but Mr Boehner has said the President had already 
secured a tax increase in a deal he made with Republicans in December. 

'American
family's wages aren't growing,' the House speaker said. 'They're being 
squeezed. And as a result, we've got to find a way through our tax code 
to promote more economic growth in our country.  We can do this by 
closing loopholes, bringing the (tax) rates down for all Americans, 
making the tax code fairer. It will promote more economic growth.'

Headed in without hope: Boehner agreed to nothing during the last-ditch negotiation session

On
Friday the President said it could take some time before members of 
Congress agree to bargain with him on how to replace the spending cuts.

He
told reporters that he hoped that as members of Congress began to hear 
from constituents who are being negatively impacted they would think of a
way to move forward.

'It's going to mean hundreds of thousands 
of jobs lost,' the President said. “That is real. We're not making that 
up.  That’s not a scare tactic, that’s a fact.'

Mr Boehner 
responded, 'I don't know whether it's going to hurt the economy or not. I
don't think anyone quite understands how the sequester is really going 
to work.'

On Saturday Obama made phone calls to both Democratic 
and GOP  senators to form a 'caucus of common sense' and support an 
alternative to the spending cuts.

Sharing his thoughts: Former presidential candidate Mitt Romney said that the sequester is not a good move for President Obama and he blamed his former opponent for 'forcing' Republicans to dig in their heels

Mr Boehner has also won himself a 
big-name fan in Mitt Romney, but his support comes more at Mr Obama's 
expense rather than as a result of Mr Boehner's tactics.

'Well, no one can think that that's 
been a success for the President,' the former presidential candidate 
said in his first post-campaign interview with Fox News Sunday.

'He
didn't think the sequester would happen. It is happening, but to date, 
what we've seen is the president out campaigning to the American people,
doing rallies around the country, flying around the country and 
berating Republicans and blaming and pointing. That causes the 
Republicans to retrench and to put up a wall and to fight back. It's a 
very natural human emotion.

'The
President has the opportunity to lead the nation and to bring 
Republicans and Democrats together. It's a job he's got to do, and it's a
job only the President can do.'

President
Obama officially signed off on the $85billion in spending cuts on 
Friday night after congressional leaders fail to compromise on a 
replacement deal, leaving thousands of Americans in fear for their 
jobs.

The President made his displeasure with the deal known in a formal statement from the press briefing room.

'Everybody here, 
all the folks who are cleaning the floors at the Capitol … They're going
to have less pay, the janitors, the security guards. They just got a 
pay cut, and they got to figure out how to manage that,' Obama said.

'That's real... that's not a scare tactic.'

Obama made the remarks from the White
House following a meeting with House Speaker John Boehner and Senate 
Minority Leader Mitch McConnell, as well as Democratic leaders Nancy 
Pelosi and Harry Reid.

Boehner emerged from the
meeting and told reporters that taxes were off the table as an option 
to avoid the spending cuts, making it clear that no compromise had been 
made.

'The discussion about revenue, in my view, is over,' he said. 'It's about taking on the spending problem.'

Obama blamed Republicans for the country's predicament, claiming that there are many conservatives on Capitol Hill who agree with him, but are unwilling to say so publicly.

President Obama wanted to replace the so-called sequester with a plan that would raise revenues as well as make a series of targeted spending cuts. But after making concessions on taxes in December by raising rates on the wealthiest of Americans, Republicans said they were unwilling to include new revenues in a plan to avert the sequester.

The
immediate impact of the reductions remains uncertain, even as Obama has
declared it would mean 'hundreds of thousands of jobs lost.'

The
administration has pulled back on earlier warnings of long lines 
developing quickly at airports and teacher layoffs affecting classrooms.
Because of those claims, Obama has been accused of posturing and exaggerating the effects of the cuts.

His warnings of economic doom appeared to be a partial attempt to avert blame in the future if the economy begins to contract.

'Every time that we get a piece of economic news over the next month, two months or six months...  We'll know that that economic news could have been better if Congress had not failed to act,' he said.

Industries most affected by the cuts 
will be those that rely heavily on government funding, including the 
military and defense contractors.

'Communities near military bases will take a serious blow,' Obama said. 'Border patrol agents, FBI agents ... 
all will suffer significant pay cuts and furloughs.'

While Obama warned off mass layoffs and smaller salaries as an immediate result of the cuts, he also hedged his warnings, saying, 'This is not going to be an apocalypse... It's just dumb.'

He urged Congress to continue working on a plan to eventually replace the sequester.

'I don't anticipate a huge financial 
crisis, but people are going to be hurt, he said. 'The economy will not grow as 
quickly as it would have, unemployment will not go down as quickly as it 
would have.'

Mr Boehner said Congress will move next week on a measure to maintain government funding after March 27th.
