Boxing at the Games stepped into a brave new world without headguards and, within minutes of the first bout, Mathew Martin, of Nauru, had a large lump on his head while Northern Ireland’s Michael Conlan had blood streaming down his face.

The International Boxing Association stopped the use of headgear in male fights, citing medical experts who said it would help lower concussions.

After celebrating Friday’s win in his bantamweight contest, Olympic bronze medallist Conlan, from Belfast, was in no mood to disagree with the decision, saying: ‘I loved fighting without the headguard but cuts are going to be dangerous when you turn professional so you’re better off learning now. Boxing is going to have to get used to it.’

England super-heavyweight Joe Joyce, who beat Seychelles rival Keddy Agnes on a unanimous 3-0 decision, agreed, adding: ‘I like boxing without headguards. There is the risk of cuts but that’s boxing. It’s early days of boxing without them and we are all still learning.’

But that sentiment was far from unanimous. Kenya’s Benson Njangiru, who won his bantamweight fight, said going into the ring for the first time without headgear was ‘scary’.

‘You have to be more worried about cuts,’ said Njangiru, who won a silver medal at the 2010 Commonwealth Games in New Delhi. ‘But the change affects both fighters the same way.’

While female fighters and younger boxers will still use headgear, the boxing association cited medical studies that wearing headgear diffused blows to the head and allowed boxers to sustain more head shots (and potential brain damage) for longer periods of time.

Harry Hawkins of Northern Ireland, who coaches the Mozambique team, said: ‘I am not in favour of it, there were two guys cut in the first fight. These guys will be getting hit far too often. It is OK in a one-off competition, but these fighters will have five bouts in 10 days.’ 

Hawkins hopes headguards are restored before the 2016 Olympic Games.

England boxing team chief John Hallam said: ‘The boxers are now here to box, to keep their head out of the stance. We believe that, with the headguards on, you tended to lean in, to take the punch. We all feel that won’t be a problem now.’

And blood in the ring?

‘Unfortunately it happens, doesn’t it?’ Hallam said.

Paul Johnston, coach of the Northern Ireland team, said he’s confident that the research used by the association to cite fewer concussions is sound. He also points to a positive side benefit — a more spectator-friendly sport that allows  boxer’s faces and reactions to be seen by the fans.

‘It will enhance the spectator experience, and anything that increases the participation of the sport can only be a good thing,’ Johnston said.
