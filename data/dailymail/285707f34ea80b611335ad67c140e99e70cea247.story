The mystery surrounding the death of Russian oligarch Boris Berezovsky deepened last night after radiation experts spent hours combing the Berkshire mansion where his body was found.

A two-mile safety cordon was set up amid fears the exiled tycoon had been murdered with radioactive poisoning.

The alert had been raised when a paramedic’s radiation alarm was triggered as he left the £20million property after failing to revive Mr Berezovsky, whose body was discovered by a bodyguard on the bathroom floor.

Some friends said they believed Mr Berezovsky, pictured with his former girlfriend Elena Gorbunova, may have been the victim of a professional hit for speaking out against Russian president Vladimir Putin's regime

The estate, in Ascot, was finally 
declared safe after an exhaustive search by experts in chemical, 
biological and nuclear emergencies.

Last night police said the death of 
the 67-year-old tycoon was ‘unexplained’, with the cause still unknown. A
senior detective said he was keeping an ‘open mind’.

Mr Berezovsky was found dead on Saturday afternoon after the bodyguard had become concerned and smashed open the bathroom door.

Some friends said they believed Mr 
Berezovsky may have been the victim of a professional hit for speaking 
out against Russian president Vladimir Putin’s regime.

Others thought he
had killed himself after becoming depressed over the loss of his wealth
and status.

The controversial tycoon, who was once worth £3billion, was
to be a key witness at the inquest of murdered spy Alexander 
Litvinenko, who was assassinated with radioactive poisoning in London 
six years ago.

Historian Yuri Felshtinsky, who has 
known Mr Berezovsky since 1998, said: ‘We do not have facts yet but we 
must bear in mind that there have been several questionable deaths of 
Russian emigres in the UK.

'It is more plausible to me that [Berezovsky] 
was killed as an act of revenge for speaking out against the Kremlin or 
perhaps as a warning to others not to cross them.

‘It is possible to kill someone and 
disguise it as natural causes. The FSB [the Russian security service] 
have structures in place to kill people. For a long time the British 
authorities believed Litvinenko was dying of some unknown disease. He 
did not have a heart condition, appeared to be in good health.’

Mr Berezovsky was said to have been 
‘destroyed’ after losing a £3billion legal action against his former 
business partner, Chelsea Football Club owner Roman Abramovich.

He sued his one-time protege last 
year alleging that he had been intimidated into selling him shares in 
Russian oil conglomerate Sibneft. The legal battle is thought to have 
been the most expensive of all time, with Mr Berezovsky left with costs 
as high as £100million.

He had faced a new legal battle 
brought by his former girlfriend Elena Gorbunova, who had applied to the
High Court to freeze his reported £200million assets.

Last night former Tory spin doctor 
Lord Bell, who was a friend, said Mr Berezovsky had lost all of his 
money and had even sold the house in Ascot recently to pay off his 
debts. He was understood to have sold properties on the French Riviera 
and an Andy Warhol print, Red Lenin, for £133,875.

‘I’m very sad,’ Lord Bell said. ‘I’ve
lost a very great friend. He was depressed about his financial 
situation, his legal situation and his private life. And he was very 
badly battered by the judge’s comments in the case against Abramovich.’

But Lord Bell added: ‘I don’t happen to think that he was the kind of person who would commit suicide.’

However, in an informal interview 
with a Russian journalist on the night before he died, Mr Berezovsky 
reportedly said: ‘My life no longer makes sense. I have no desire to 
take part in politics. I don’t know what I should do. I am 67 years old 
and I don’t know what I should do from now on.’

The journalist, Ilya 
Zhegulev, claims the tycoon was desperate to return to Russia and hated 
being in exile.

The Kremlin claimed yesterday that Mr
Berezovsky had written to Mr Putin several months ago to ask 
forgiveness and seek a route back to Russia. Lord Bell said such a 
suggestion was ‘nonsense’ and the oligarch remained as much as ever a 
target of the Russian state.

Mr Berezovsky, a former mathematician
who had made his fortune in oil, aviation and television in the 
immediate aftermath of the fall of communism, fled Russia in 2000 and 
was put on the country’s official wanted list in 2001 on charges of 
fraud and money laundering.

The UK granted him political asylum 
in 2003 and he used London as a base from which to launch critical 
attacks on Mr Putin and to call for his overthrow.

He had survived several assassination attempts in Russia, including a bomb that decapitated his chauffeur.

Yesterday Detective Chief Inspector 
Brown, of Thames Valley Police, said: ‘We are at the early stages of the
investigation and we are retaining an open mind as we progress.

‘The investigation team are building a
picture of the last days of Mr Berezovsky’s life, speaking to close 
friends and family to gain a better understanding of his state of mind.

‘We do not have any evidence at this stage to suggest third party involvement.’
