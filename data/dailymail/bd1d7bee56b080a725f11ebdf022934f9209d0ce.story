Stuck in a hedge and unable to spread his wings and fly to safety, this two-week-old blackbird was found abandoned by its mother all because of its rare colouring.

The tiny pure white albino bird - which has red eyes - was found by a passerby in a bush near Cirencester, Gloucestershire.

It was taken to nearby Oak and Furrows Wildlife Rescue Centre, where it was nicknamed 'Wacky' by staff.

It is now being nursed back to heath under the watchful eye of the centre staff.

Founder Serena Stevens, 48, said: 'I've only seen a photo in a book once before.

'The chances of us having one is so rare I don't think I'll ever get the chance to see one again in my lifetime.

'To see something that is as rare as this is just mind blowing.

Life span: Albino blackbirds have a short life expectancy because they are badly camouflaged and are rejected by other birds. Oak and Furrows will nurse the white blackbird for a few more months and then hope to release it into the wild

Albino blackbirds have a short life expectancy because they are badly camouflaged and are rejected by other birds.

Oak and Furrows will nurse the white blackbird for a few more months and then hope to release it into the wild.

In January this year, a four-year-old albino blackbird was reported to be living in a country park in Nottinghamshire.

Blackbirds sometimes suffer from leucism - weak pigmentation in the feathers, causing them to be white or off-white.

Wacky has a complete lack of melanin - meaning it is pure white with red eyes.
