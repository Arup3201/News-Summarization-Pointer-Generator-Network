Wilfried Bony believes he has made the right decision in joining Manchester City after revealing other clubs were keen to sign him.

The 26-year-old completed his £25million plus add-ons move to the Etihad on January 14, penning a four-and-a-half-year deal.

In an exclusive interview with Sky Sports News, the striker said: 'I think so,' when asked if City was the only offer he considered. 'I don't know if I should have chosen the other one. I think this is the best club for me.'

The Ivory Coast international, who ended 2014 as the Premier League's deadliest marksman in the calender year - with 20 goals, was also subject of interest from Liverpool and Tottenham as well as Spanish giants Real Madrid - as Sportsmail revealed earlier this month.

However, speaking to City boss Manuel Pellegrini and the lure of playing Champions League football for the first time in his career made the move a no-brainer for Bony who is keen to be part of City's 'project' moving forward.

'Yeah, he [Manuel Pellegrini] talked to me [and said] "I really need you here, you will be part of our project. I hope you will enjoy it here and I think it's the right way for you to get one step more in your career and your life. I think you will enjoy here."

'It's [the Champions League] a competition that I didn't play yet. I really want to feel it, I really want to enjoy it. I want to be in the action, not just to see every time on the TV. It's good motivation for me.'

Bony, who is away with the Ivory Coast at the Africa Cup of Nations, also revealed that international team-mate and City midfield powerhouse Yaya Toure played a pivotal role in his move to the blue half of Manchester.

'He [Yaya Toure] helped me in my move to City,' Bony added.

'When I spoke to the coach [Pellegrini] he told me: "I'll be asking Yaya Toure how you are and how you work." It's a part of my move to Manchester City. He's a player who every time I've spoken to him he has given me a lot of advice. I'm OK with him, he's helped me a lot.'
