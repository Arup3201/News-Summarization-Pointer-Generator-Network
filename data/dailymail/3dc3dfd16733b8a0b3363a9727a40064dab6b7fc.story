Newcastle owner Mike Ashley has angered the club’s coaching staff after withdrawing their complimentary ticket allocation.

Alan Pardew’s No 2 John Carver, former England international Steve Stone and goalkeeping coach Andy Woodman are among those who are now being forced to pay for match tickets.

Senior members of the backroom team would be given four seats each for games in a private box at St James’ Park, but Ashley has now scrapped their allowance on the eve of the new season.

The billionaire’s money-saving measures have extended beyond the coaching team. Long-serving kit men and administrative staff have also seen their two-ticket privilege taken away.

It has left a feeling of resentment towards the owner behind the scenes at the club. In protest, staff refused to accept free tickets for Sunday’s pre-season friendly with Real Sociedad.

Managing director Lee Charnley was the man who relayed Ashley’s instruction and Sportsmail understands it did not go down well. It is not known whether Pardew himself is included, although the policy is thought to cover all employees.

Staff are upset and shocked that they will now have to pay should they want match tickets for friends and family.

Morale among staff at the club’s training ground is now at rock bottom.

Controversial: Newcastle owner Mike Ashley has scrapped free tickets for some staff in cost-cutting exercise

The club made no comment when contacted about the matter.

Pardew’s thoughts on the issue are not known either as the club are refusing to allow their manager to speak to the press other than when contractually obliged. 

Pardew himself is thought to be frustrated by this move and would prefer to engage in a healthy dialogue with the media and therefore supporters.

Meanwhile, the club will hold an open training session at St James’ on Tuesday. 

But one player who will not be there is Hatem Ben Arfa. Instead, he has invited fans to meet him at a local bookshop just around the corner from the ground.

Frozen out: French midfielder Hatem Ben Arfa has been told he has no future at Newcastle

The French midfielder has been forced to train with the reserves this summer after Pardew questioned his ‘professionalism’.

There is little chance of a reconciliation and Newcastle would prefer Ben Arfa to find a new club.

The former Marseille man has one year remaining on his contract and the Magpies would like to bring in a fee for the playmaker.

However, there is every chance Ben Arfa could head out on loan for the duration of this season before leaving on a free next summer.
