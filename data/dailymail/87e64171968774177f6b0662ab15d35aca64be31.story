A fraudster who claimed to be Scottish nobility has pleaded guilty to welfare fraud while living a life of luxury in a lakefront mansion with millions of dollars stashed in the bank.  

'Lord' Colin Chisholm III is facing 21 months in jail after admitting that he claimed thousands of dollars in benefits in Minnesota while owning a $1.2million yacht in Florida.

The 62-year-old appeared in court on Monday to plead guilty to one count of wrongfully obtaining public assistance and one count of theft by swindle over $35,000, according to the Hennepin County attorney's office.

'Lord' Chisholm, pictured with his wife 'Lady' Andrea Chisholm and their son, kept quiet about their profitable business breeding Cavalier King Charles Spaniels while claiming welfare 

In court on Monday, Chisholm said he had filled out forms which allowed him and wife Andrea to siphon off benefits they were not entitled to.

Colin Chisholm told the court: 'I received benefits from Hennepin County I really wasn’t entitled to. I’m taking full responsibility for that.'

Along with his 52-year-old wife Andrea, Colin Chisholm allegedly received $167,000 in Medicaid and food stamps - although he disputes this amount. 

The couple have also been ordered to pay restitution which will be decided at a later hearing. 

The phony aristocrat is due to be sentenced in January and prosecutors hope to send him away for 21 months. 

Prosecutors claimed the Chisholms ran a seven-year scam while owning a six-bedroom palatial home on the shore of Lake Minnetonka, a $1.2 million yacht, a beach property in Florida, a $30,000 Lexus and $3million in undeclared funds. 

Because Chisholm admitted to 'major economic crimes', it allowed the attorney's office to seek prison time.

In a statement, Hennepin County Attorney Mike Freeman said: 'Too often, people think that only poor people commit crimes. We know that is not true and the Chisholms are a perfect example.

'What they did was abominable, stealing from the government and the taxpayers while living a luxurious lifestyle. That’s why we pushed for a tougher sentence than the probation he normally would have received.'

Andrea Chisholm pleaded guilty to wrongfully obtaining welfare in August and was sentenced to one year and one day in prison, with credit for 142 days already served.

‘It’s appropriate that Andrea Chisholm spend time behind bars for cheating the public of welfare dollars,’ Freeman said at the time.

Andrea and Colin Chisholm III, who claimed to be descended from Scottish nobility, appear in court together in April after being caught out in a massive welfare fraud

Large-scale fraud: The so-called 'Lady Chisholm' and her husband, Colin Chisholm III (right), 62, reportedly collected more than $167,000 in fraudulent medical and food-stamp claims for seven years

Dynasty: According to their company website, the couple trace their roots to Clan Chisholm in Struy, Scotland 

The family’s web of lies began unraveling, according to officials, as investigators tightened the net around them earlier this year, forcing the couple to flee to the Bahamas along with their seven-year-old son and their dog.

According to a criminal complaint filed in February, the Chisholms applied for more than a dozen forms of medical assistance, welfare payments and food stamps, first in Minnesota and then in Florida.

Lady Chisholm had her prenatal care for the couple's son in 2006 paid for by the state while claiming to be destitute.

Colin Chisholm did not declare that he ran a broadcasting business, while Lady Chisholm kept quiet about being the owner of a dog kennel which bred elite Cavalier King Charles Spaniels.

According to the website for their company Strathglass Kennel, the couple trace their roots to the Clan Chisholm from the small village of Struy in the Scottish Highlands.

Mr Chisholm is listed as the president and CEO of TCN Network, a satellite TV company serving the Caribbean.

More than $1million flowed through accounts he controlled as part of that company, a criminal complaint stated.

The couple were living with Lady Chisholm's mother in Minneapolis when they first applied for welfare in 2005.

Living the dream: The couple moved into this sprawling lakefront property on Lake Minnetonka in 2008

Lap of luxury: The seemingly destitute couple not only owned a $1.2million yacht but also a $30,000 Lexus

However, for the next two years, they resided on their Florida yacht, and later at a beach property in the state, none of which was ever declared, investigators claimed.

In April 2007, the Chisholms came back to Minnesota and filled out forms for more benefits.

In March 2008, they moved into a luxury home in Deephaven with Andrea’s grandparents Eloise and Francis Heidecker.

Francis Heidecker died in February 2009 at age 94 and by September of that year, the Chisholms were evicted from the home.

They immediately moved to another Deephaven home on Lake Minnetonka with stunning waterfront views.

The home, built in 1909, has six bedrooms, five bathrooms and stretch to 5,800 sq ft set on 1.6 acres, according to property records.

None of these details were declared on welfare forms - nor the fact Andrea Chisholm had power of attorney and controlled the finances of her elderly grandmother.
