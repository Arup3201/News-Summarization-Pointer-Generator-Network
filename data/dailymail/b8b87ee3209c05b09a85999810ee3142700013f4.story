They've been through a traumatic nine months, so it was a beautiful sight for all to see when a brave Gabrielle Giffords today proudly pinned a medal onto her husband’s jacket and gave him a hug.

The 41-year-old Arizona congresswoman - who continues on her road to recovery after being shot - was at a Navy retirement ceremony for Mark Kelly in Washingon D.C. after two decades of service.

She looked well - with short brown hair, wearing a jewelled necklace and a smart red suit jacket - as the couple posed with House Democratic Leader Nancy Pelosi and Vice President Joe Biden.

Mrs Giffords was in Washington D.C. for the second time since she was shot in January outside a Tucson grocery store.

She stunned colleagues in August 
when she briefly returned to the Capitol to vote for a bill raising the 
government's debt ceiling.

Her hair was a little longer than her 
last appearance but she walked with a limp, assisted by a staffer, 
reported the Arizona Daily Star.

Her press secretary Mark Kimble said 
Mrs Giffords is returning to Houston, Texas, afterwards - where she is 
undergoing rehabilitation therapy.

Her husband Mr Kelly was the commander of the last mission of space shuttle Endeavour in May. He is writing a memoir with his wife 
that is set to be released in November.

'You've been an inspiration, an 
inspiration to thousands of people who suffer from traumatic head 
injuries. People look at you and say: "I can make it. I can do this"'

Vice-President Joe Biden

The event on Thursday was 
presided over by Mr Biden.

‘It’s not every day you encounter 
examples of sheer courage and selflessness and dedication like you see 
with this couple,’ he said.

'You've been an inspiration, an inspiration to thousands of people who suffer from traumatic head injuries.

'People look at you and say: "I can make it. I can do this".'

Her close friend Wasserman Schultz, 
who is chairwoman of the Democratic National Committee, said she 
continues to make ‘wonderful progress’.

Mrs
Giffords made a dramatic return to Congress in August on the floor of 
the House of Representatives to vote on raising the nation's debt 
ceiling.

She was met 
with thunderous applause. It was her first time there since she was shot
in the head during the shooting spree at a constituent event.

College dropout Jared Lee Loughner, 23, has been charged with 49 crimes in the shooting spree.

Mr Kelly, 47, announced his retirement from the Navy and NASA after 25 years in June.

He flew 39 missions in Operation 
Desert Storm and made four trips into space, including commanding the 
last mission of space shuttle Endeavour.

Mr Kelly and Mrs Giffords are 
collaborating on a memoir titled, 'Gabby: A Story of Courage and Hope'. 
It is scheduled for release on November 15.
