Heidi the cross-eyed opossum has been put down in Germany to ease her suffering.

The visually challenged critter who became an Internet sensation - she had three times as many Facebook fans as Chancellor Angela Merkel - passed away today.

'The cross-eyed opossum Heidi has closed her eyes for ever,' said the zoo in Leipzig, eastern Germany.

Heidi the opossum has died, Leipzig Zoo have confirmed

The animal, aged three-and-a-half, had been treated for health problems for weeks and zoo officials decided to put her down 'to spare her further pain and suffering'.

Heidi’s distinctive eye problem was thought to be due to a poor diet before she was abandoned in the United States, or because she is overweight, leading to fat deposits behind her eyes.

Leipzig Zoo said she suffered badly 
from arthritis.  While treatment for her maladies increased in recent 
weeks, putting her to sleep was seen as the kindest option.

The zoo's director, Jörg Junhold, said the decision had been made 'in the interests of the animal.'

In recent weeks, Heidi had hardly moved, as a result of her arthritis.

'We carried out all possible 
examinations and treatments,' Junhold said. The only explanation, he 
added, was old age, something that the veterinarians could do nothing 
against.

Leipzig Zoo first presented Heidi, 
who was born in May 2008 and had previously lived in Denmark's Odense 
Zoo, to the public in December 2010.

She quickly became a media sensation 
because of her cute cross-eyed look, and was the star attraction of the 
zoo's 'Gondwanaland' tropical house, which opened in July 2011.

A toy manufacturer made cross-eyed 
opossum toys in tribute to the creature, and she made an appearance on 
an American television show about the 2011 Oscars earlier this year.

The unusual-looking opossum was the latest in a long line of animal stars to capture German hearts.

A polar bear called Knut in Berlin became a global media star in 2007, even appearing on the front page of Vanity Fair magazine, before plunging the country into shock with his sudden death earlier this year.

Then, during the last football World Cup in South Africa, an octopus named Paul shot to global stardom by correctly 'predicting' the results of eight out of eight matches.  He went to the great aquarium in the sky too.
