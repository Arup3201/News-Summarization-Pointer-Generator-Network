James Ward slipped to a straight-sets second-round defeat to number four seed Grigor Dimitrov at the Queen's Club Aegon Championships.

British No. 3 Ward saw off Slovenian Blaz Rola on Monday, but was unable to produce what would have been a big upset against Bulgarian Dimitrov.

Compatriot Dan Evans crashed out in straight sets to seventh-seed Kevin Anderson in the first match on centre court on Tuesday, and Ward was unable to fare any better.

Ward was brushed aside 7-5 6-3 by the world number 13, unable to make light of his 142-place shortfall in the ATP tour rankings.
