An actress staged a real-life version of the Producers when she and her husband ran off to LA with $68,000 and bombed with a show meant for New York, a lawsuit from investors alleges.

Candice Guardino had lined up investors to stage a production of her show Italian Bred in New York, but instead traveled to LA, where she and her husband Tom Felicciardi used a cut of the budget to live in luxury.

One of the investors, Joe Cecala, 68, told the New York Post that plans were in place to mount the show at the Clurman Theatre, a 99-seat venue in Manhattan.

Instead, Guardino brought it to Los Angeles's Hudson Theatre where 'it got destroyed' because she 'comped' the majority of the audience, according to Cecala, himself a former producer who currently works as a hotel manager.

'I saw the receipts, and they netted only $1,500,' he said.

The lawsuit alleges that once in LA, Guardino and her husband blew most of the fund on expenses unrelated to the production, such as an apartment, rented cars, spa trips, clothes and a publicist.

The list of accusations against Guardino and Felicciardi are racketeering, securities fraud, and falsifying documents to 'hide an intentional misappropriation of funds.'

Cecala invested $48,000 in the bomb, while two other investors, Emily Conner and Lawrence Schwartz, invested $10,000 each. The group is seeking an addition $200,000 in damages.

Guardino wrote and starred in the show, which was based on her larger-than-life grandmother and other characters borrowed from her upbringing in an Italian-American family in Brooklyn and Staten Island.

The show originally ran at the Theatre at St. Luke's, a 174-seat theater, to mostly positive reviews.

Italian Bred even benefited from some star power, filling cameo roles with celebrities such as the Sopranos' Steve Shirripa and Vincent Pastore, and Sex in the City's Mario Cantone.

On the Facebook page for Italian Bred, Guardino and Felicciardi claimed, 'We have an absolute contractual right to do a developmental production in Los Angeles.'
