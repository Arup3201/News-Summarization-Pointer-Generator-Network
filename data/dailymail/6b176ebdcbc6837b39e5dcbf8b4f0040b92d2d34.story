The city of Peekskill, New York will pay out a $5.4 million settlement to a man who spent 16 years in prison for a murder he didn’t commit.

On Tuesday, the city approved the settlement with Jeffrey Deskovic, who has been a public face of wrongful conviction and imprisonment since his name was cleared in 2007.

Deskovic, now 39, was 16 when he was charged with the November 1989 killing of his 15-year-old high school classmate and has won two other multimillion dollar lawsuits in the years since his release.

Compensation: Jeffrey Deskovic embraces MarryAnn Lubas, director of the National Freedom March for the Wrongfully Convicted. Deskovic spent 16 years in jail for a murder he didn't commit starting in high school

In a statement to MailOnline on Thursday, Deskovic expressed gratitude for the settlement, while also shaming authorities, who agreed to the sum without admitting wrongdoing.

'I am pleased that after many years of litigation we were able to work out a settlement with Peekskill so that I can continue focusing on rebuilding my life as well as my anti-wrongful conviction advocacy,

'At the same time, I am concerned that even in the face of a $5.4 million dollar settlement,  Peekskill and the Peekskill officers involved still refuse to admit their misconduct or the harm it caused me. There is much more at stake than a personal apology; Peekskill’s silence suggests that they have not learned any lessons from my case and I remain concerned about wrongful convictions and criminal justice in Peekskill going forward.'

Wealthy: Deskovic's Tuesday settlement of $5.4M brings his total compensation since his 2007 release to $11.9M

His conviction and sentence of 15 years to life came after a confession that was later deemed to have been coerced.

While imprisoned—mostly at the maximum security Elmira Correctional Facility in Chemung County, New York—Deskovic missed the funeral of his beloved grandmother.

‘My grandmother raised me along with my mother,’ Deskovic would later write. ‘She passed away while I was incarcerated. I was faced with the horrific decision of either going to see her while she was on her death bed but in a coma, or to attend the church service once she passed away.’

Making good: Deskovic was 17 when he began a 16 year sentence, served mostly at the max security Elmira Correctional Facility (pictured). He now gives speeches and works as an advocate for the wrongfully imprisoned

He was freed from prison in 2006 after DNA linked the killing to another man named Stephen Cunningham. Cunningham was already serving a life sentence by then for killing a woman four years after he killed Correa.

Deskovic spent months on public assistance following his release, but was eventually able to make a living by booking speeches about wrongful incarceration.

‘I believe that everybody who has been released following wrongful conviction should be given immediate funds, aside from what is awarded from a lawsuit, to cover housing, cost of living, mental health services, education, health insurance,’ wrote Deskovic on his website in 2007.

The former inmate now has enough to survive and then some.

Deskovic previously received $1.8 million from the state of New York for the wrongful imprisonment.

He also won $6.5 million from Westchester County to finally settle his lawsuit against that county and used $1.5 million of it to start the Jeffrey Deskovic Foundation for Justice, reports the Journal News.

While in prison, Deskovic received an associate’s degree. Upon his release, he was given a scholarship to New York’s Mercy College and this year he received his master’s degree from John Jay College of Criminal Justice.

Deskovic now runs the The Jeffrey Deskovic Foundation for Justice, an organization dedicated to anti-wrongful conviction advocacy.
