A man in China could be facing some time behind bars after his lacklustre attempt at robbing a bank ended with the teller laughing in his face.

The brazen but nonchalant heist took place at a China Construction Bank branch in Zhoujiazui at around midday yesterday, according to KU.

Surveillance footage of the failed robbery shows the would-be bandit, who is dressed in a blue jacket, calmly approach the teller while she is helping a female customer.

Is this a joke? Bank teller in Zhoujiazui, China, laughs when a man approaches the window with a meat cleaver

In custody: The knife-wielding would-be bandit is tackled by the bank's security staff after holding a meat cleaver against the glass

The man holds up a 20cm-long meat cleaver to the glass dividing himself and the teller, and keeps it there while he talks on his mobile phone.

Confused, the bank teller looks to her colleague on her right as the female customer picks up her bag and calmly strolls away.

Video footage then captured the teller turning around with a smile on her face and her thumb pointed towards the knife-wielding bandit as if the robbery is some sort of joke.

The teller’s smile then turns into a full-blown laugh when she sees he is still casually chatting on his phone, seemingly oblivious to the fact he is holding the weapon.

As other customers begin to leave the building, two of the bank’s security personnel approach the man and tackle him to the ground easily.

The man is reportedly a mental patient.
