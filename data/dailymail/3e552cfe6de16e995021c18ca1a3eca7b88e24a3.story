Keith Millen said Dwight Gayle’s hat-trick, that brushed aside Walsall, will lift the gloom that has hung heavy around Crystal Palace.

The caretaker manager admitted the text scandal, revealed by Sportsmail that engulfed prospective boss Malky Mackay and sporting director Iain Moody, exacerbating Tony Pulis’s departure, had made life difficult for the club.

But three clinical first-half strikes from Gayle saw Palace obtain their first win of the season and progress to the third round of the Capital One Cup.

‘As a group of people we really needed that,’ said Millen. ‘It’s no been easy but you don’t want to make excuses.

‘It will give everyone a lift. Coming in Thursday there will be a lot more smiles on the faces.’

Gayle pressed strong claims for a start against Newcastle on Saturday. ‘His hat-trick was fantastic, his finishing was really good. It gives me a nice selection problem for the weekend. He showed how clinical he can be and that’s at any level he can be at.’

Millen made nine changes to the team which lost 3-1 at home to West Ham but Gayle was the most important. ‘The team gave me the chances and I felt confident of taking them,’ Gayle said afterwards.

It took him just seven minutes to make his mark. Referee Darren Drysdale harshly penalised Walsall captain Adam Chambers for handball and as he protested Adlene Guedioura slipped a quick free-kick to Gayle.

He beat the offside trap, sprinted into the area, and drove a finish past Richard O’Donnell from a tight angle.

Walsall were actually controlling possession but Palace were the team with penetration. Walsall midfielder Billy Clifford had a couple of shots from range which tested deputy goalkeeper Wayne Hennessey but when Glenn Murray went on a marauding run for the visitors midway through the half, it signalled genuine danger.

Chambers brought Murray down and Gayle dispatched the resulting free-kick low and with venom just inside the near post.

He was looking super sharp and claimed his hat-trick four minutes before the interval. Jerome Thomas played a well-weighted ball through and Gayle twisted defender Paul Downing inside out before powering a shot beyond O’Donnell.

The opponents may only have been from League One - the division below where Gayle made his name at Peterborough - but on this form he looks worth the inflated fee of £8m Palace purportedly handed over. 

Hero: Gayle celebrates in front of the away fans after completing his first-half hat-trick in the Capital One Cup

He brought intelligent runs, pace and that aura required by top-class strikers. It reminded you of the brace he scored against Liverpool that stunned Brendan Rodgers and blew their title hopes away towards the end of last season.

Walsall are yet to win in League One this season and this match gave an indication why. They can retain the ball handsomely but do little with it. Their edge is more comfy than cutting.

Five minutes after the break Ashley Grimes went closest, bending a delicious shot against the post with Hennessey well beaten.

But it was Palace who continued to threaten more keenly. Murray flashed a shot from range just wide and Jonny Williams tested O’Donnell with a thumping shot inside the box.

Neil Warnock, Steve Clarke and Neil Lennon lead the bookmakers’ odds for next to take up position in the Selhurst Park dugout but at one stage in this match travelling fans sung: ‘Who needs a manager?’

Millen could yet continue his role further but Gayle showed the value of having a forward with predatory instincts.
