The missing mother of an Iraq war veteran who is believed to have killed
his family in a murder-suicide was found dead on Thursday off a rural 
Northern California road, police said.

Gilroy police and volunteers had been looking for 52-year-old Martha Gutierrez since last week, after the bodies of her children, 27-year-old Abel and 11-year-old Lucero, were found in their apartment.

Investigators believe Abel Gutierrez, a National Guardsman, fatally shot his mother and sister before turning the gun on himself.

Gilroy police Sgt. Chad Gallacinao said that authorities have positively identified the woman, and the family had been notified.

Investigators on Wednesday asked 
citizens in a rural part of Santa Clara and San Benito counties to keep 
an eye out for the body, after evidence led them to the area.

On Thursday the volunteers found the 
body under bushes off the highway. Gutierrez had one apparent gunshot 
wound, Gallacinao said.

'Our first priority was locating Martha Gutierrez, now we will try to figure out when and how (her death) happened,' he said.

Family members told the San Jose 
Mercury News that authorities summoned them to the location of the body 
near the border of the two counties. Kristell Gutierrez said authorities confirmed the body belonged to her aunt.

'We were hoping she was alive, but we
kind of knew that she wasn't going to be,' she told the newspaper. 
'We're just happy she's been found.'

Family members have said they 
suspected Abel Gutierrez suffered from post-traumatic stress disorder, 
and that they had been upset by his talk of suicide and brandishing of 
guns.

Two weeks before the killings, on February 29, a Gilroy police
officer responded to a service call at the apartment. Yet Abel Gutierrez'
family told the officer they did not feel threatened, so Gutierrez was not
placed on a psychological hold, police said.

The search for Martha began after the
bodies of her children were found at her apartment and evidence 
indicating a violent confrontation in Abel’s Ford Mustang was 
discovered. Crews searched 30 miles of Santa Clara County on March 17 but to no avail.

He had recently returned from a second tour of Iraq and family members told the San Francisco Chronicle
he would regularly wake during the night, screaming and angrily raging 
against the Taliban. He would apparently smoke marijuana to deal with his depression. 

Police were again called to the 
apartment on Wednesday night after a roommate came home, suspected 
something was wrong, and went back outside.

Responding officers found the bodies of Gutierrez and Lucero dead from gunshot wounds.

There
was no sign of their mother. However, police found clues inside the 
home that indicated she may be seriously hurt - or worse.

Family members told the San Jose Mercury News that Gutierrez often said that he wanted to kill himself 'all the time' and would ask if that would hurt them.

A niece, Kristell Gutierrez, said she knew her uncle was 'very mean' to his mother and blamed her for his father leaving the family.

Alissa Fernandez, a neighbour, told the newspaper that Gutierrez 'was just weird, the way he would act.'

About two weeks ago, Martha Gutierrez apparently went to the apartment manager, saying she was 'scared of her son'.

Mario
Reyes, a neighbour who lives beneath the Gutierrez family, told KNTV-TV
that he thought he heard a scuffle - but no gunshots - around the time 
police say the shooting occurred.

Gallacinao said officers found at least two firearms used in the killings, but he would not say whether Gutierrez left a suicide note.

Because Gutierrez did not seem dangerous and did not meet the criteria to be placed on a psychiatric hold when police initially attended, they began working with the family and Office of Veterans Affairs in Palo Alto to help him.

Gutierrez had been receiving care at a VA facility in Puget Sound, Washington, confirmed a spokesman for the Department of Veterans Affairs Care System.

Friends of the family paid tribute to Lucero, who was described as a 'sweet little girl'.

A woman named Emily who lives nearby told the Gilroy Dispatch the 11-year-old was 'the best little girl in the world.

Her son Julian, also 11, used to play with Power Rangers with Lucero, and said he had prayed that she would be safe when he first heard about the violence.

A six-year-old neighbour, Evenny, also remembered the victim happily, and said: 'We were all best friends.'
