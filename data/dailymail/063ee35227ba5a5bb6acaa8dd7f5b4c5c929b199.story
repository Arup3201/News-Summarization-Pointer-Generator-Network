A partygoer bit a stranger on the face as she danced in a cage in a night club after drinking to celebrate her birthday, a court has heard. 

Katie Bateman turned on the man in the club because she is suffering from a stress disorder as a result of traumatic events in her childhood, it was said. 

She admitted attacking a fellow customer at Caesar's Palace club in Bideford, Devon, and grabbing a second by his T-shirt in a confrontation at the bar.

Confrontation: Katie Bateman turned on the man at Caesar's Palace club in Bideford, Devon

Bateman, 27, had been celebrating her birthday in August last year when she carried out the attack while suffering from anxiety which made her 'hyper vigilant' about approaches from men.

A psychologist's report showed she suffers from post traumatic stress disorder which makes her prone to panic attacks and depression.

She was forced to leave a hearing at Exeter Crown Court when she became distressed as the Judge was told of the evidence against her.

Bateman, of Bideford, Devon, admitted causing actual bodily harm to Aaron McMahon and assault by beating of Richard Ball.

Her sentence was adjourned for reports by Judge Erik Salomonsen.

The Judge told her she would not face an immediate jail sentence. 

He said: 'I have seen the letter from her doctor and the psychological report and it seems to me a case where she needs to be treated in the community to ensure there is no further offending.'

The judge made his ruling after being told that CCTV from the club showed the incident in which the first victim suffered a small graze and bruising to his face after she leaned over and bit him on the cheek.

The second was grabbed by the shirt in a second incident shortly afterwards.

She had been drinking, taking drugs and dancing in a cage shortly before the attacks and later said she had little memory of what happened.

Miss Beth Heaton, defending, said Bateman was out celebrating her birthday with family and friends.She said: 'She suffers from PTSD among other conditions and that may be relevant to these offences in that she may have believed she was going to be assaulted.

'She reacted in a hyper vigilant way to what she perceived as threats from males. When she was shown the CCTV she became very anxious and had a panic attack.

'She reacted very differently from someone who was not suffering from her condition. She has been suffering for some time, having been diagnosed in 2007.'

Miss Heaton said the attacks in August last year coincided with the start of a new treatment regime which is proving successful.
