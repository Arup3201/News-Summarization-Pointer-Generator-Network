Elite Army snipers are receiving security training from the SAS amid fears that they and their families will be targeted by Islamic terrorists following a series of blunders.

Defence chiefs published online and in official reports the names and photographs of sharpshooters – a move the snipers say could endanger their lives.

At least 50 troops, including those belonging to elite Parachute Regiment and Royal Marine units, and some who have since left the Army, have attended briefings as concerns increase for their safety.

The identity of snipers must be protected because jihadis consider them to be high-value targets

On the courses at SAS headquarters in Hereford, the snipers are being advised how to escape and evade capture if jihadis strike at their homes or when they are going about their everyday lives.

They are also warned not to carry military identification, remove their names from the electoral roll and to report suspicious activity to police.

The courses include briefings on cyber-security, with the snipers being shown how to thwart attempts to hack into their mobile phones, email and Facebook pages.

The extraordinary measures had to be brought in after the Ministry of Defence breached rules that state that members of Britain's Special Forces and snipers should never be identified.

The rules must be strictly observed because jihadis consider snipers to be high-value targets. Their specialist role and devastating impact on the battlefield have been popularised in the Oscar-nominated film American Sniper, starring Bradley Cooper as US Navy Seal Chris Kyle, who was credited with 160 confirmed kills in Iraq.

Last night, a former British Army sniper described the horrifying moment when he found an Army report on the internet which described how he had shot dead a Taliban fighter in Helmand province, southern Afghanistan, at a range of more than 1,000 yards.

He said: 'Since then I've lived every day with the fear that I or my family members will be targeted. I can never feel entirely safe in this country after coming back from the war zone and being identified in that report.

'It is especially sickening as while I was still serving in Afghanistan, I gave my commanders explicit instructions that I didn't want to be identified or put up for any sort of recognition when we came home.

'It was a stupid mistake on their part. I only found out when a friend pointed it out. Naturally people are concerned for me, and as snipers we're aware of the threats to us.'

The sniper has taken drastic measures to protect himself and his relatives, including varying his routes to and from local shops and keeping a 'crash-out bag' – a rucksack containing items he would need to evade capture by Muslim extremists. 

The man, whose experiences on the front line left him suffering from post-traumatic stress disorder, genuinely fears he is a target.

He added: 'I'm careful who I discuss my Army life with, while giving out my phone number or my home address is a complete no-no. And when I'm going somewhere for the first time, I need to work out how I could get out of there fast and without being tailed.

'I'm prepared for 'going to ground', as we snipers call it. I'd grab the crash-out bag and go. It might sound like paranoia to most people but then they're not snipers. They don't know how badly the terrorists want us dead.'

He is not the first sniper to be exposed by blundering MoD officials. Four years ago, Household Cavalry Trooper Craig Harrison's cover was blown after he achieved the longest successful shots by a British soldier – killing two Taliban fighters from two miles away.

On his return to Britain, Trooper Harrison agreed to be interviewed by the media after receiving assurances from MoD officials that none of his personal details would be revealed. But the officials failed to inform newspapers, leading to the publication of his name and family information. Days later he was told by police that UK-based Al Qaeda sympathisers were plotting to kidnap him.

Trooper Harrison suffered acute distress and later received £100,000 compensation from the MoD.

The revelation that snipers are receiving enhanced security and cyber-security training follows the brutal execution of Fusilier Lee Rigby in Woolwich in 2013, and recent intelligence from a Government agency, the Joint Terrorism Analysis Centre, that jihadis want to kidnap a soldier or police officer.

An MoD spokesman said last night: 'Keeping our personnel and assets safe is of the utmost importance, which is why our security arrangements are kept under continual review and frequently tested.

'All personnel are given clear guidance on social media use and informed of the standards of behaviour expected of them whether offline or online, on duty or off duty.'

By a British Army sniper 

I was a British Army sniper who served multiple tours of southern Afghanistan. Being a civilian now is a big change and to be honest I miss being a sharpshooter every day – going to the war zone and doing my job. But then I look at my daughter and I realise I want to be at home with her.

I also did my fair share [of killing], but with what is going on in the world today maybe what I did was not enough? When I was down there in Afghanistan, I had no idea that I'd face these threats at home.

As an ex-sniper, I can never go public about what I did as a sharpshooter. Instead, I live a quiet life in order to protect my family – they are my priority and it is them I worry about. I'm always wary of people asking questions about my background and I don't give out my personal details. I also change my phone numbers and emails.

Snipers should take these precautions, especially considering what has happened to those who've had their cover blown in the media and on the internet. They've been to hell and back since officials let slip their names, which was unforgivable. So it is good that snipers are getting extra training to protect themselves.

It is very hard for people to understand what we have to deal with, because they haven't done what we've done. Sniping is a dark art. Basically we're there to kill the enemy and we're good at it. But that makes us unpopular with the enemy and their sympathisers here, so we're high-value targets.

I'm not looking for understanding or sympathy. It is easy for me to come to terms with my actions, basically because it has to be. I was woken up one night in Afghanistan and told to take out a Taliban fighter. I did it and I was back in my bed asleep ten minutes later as if nothing had happened. Sometimes it is that easy mentally. I couldn't be constantly thinking or worrying about what I was doing because I would have big problems, wouldn't I?

The film American Sniper is huge and it has got people thinking about how we deal with the job. Whether what a sniper does gets too personal or emotional for him to deal with depends on his mindset, his experience and his upbringing. For me, blocking thoughts like that got easier as I went back to Afghanistan and did the same thing again and again.

I am sceptical when I hear figures for so-called confirmed kills for British snipers, such as the 173 reported last week for a Royal Marine. How can they be sure? People don't normally die straight away when you shoot them. It is also hard to tell from long range. The idea of sniping is that you fire from far enough away that you don't have to go down there and check. Killing more people doesn't make you a better soldier either.
