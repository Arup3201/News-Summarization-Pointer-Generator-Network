Robbie Henshaw will have his first tangible crack at Ireland's vacant 13 shirt on Saturday after being paired alongside Gordon D'Arcy in midfield to face Australia.

The post-Brian O'Driscoll era remains yet to launch at full-tilt however, as boss Joe Schmidt still cannot select from midfield strength.

So with Jared Payne sidelined through foot trouble, the wait to decipher head coach Schmidt's first-choice centre pairing goes on.

Mike Ross and Simon Zebo are the only two starters retained from last weekend's 49-7 victory over Georgia, with Ireland back to full strength to face Michael Cheika's Wallabies.

Fit-again hooker Rory Best returns to the front-row, while Rhys Ruddock returns at flanker given Chris Henry could be recuperating from his brain injury for some time.

Leinster stalwart D'Arcy missed the autumn's opening clash against the Springboks with calf trouble, with Ulster's Payne limping out of that 29-15 victory in the closing stages.

The net result of the various midfield injuries and chopping and changing for the visit of Georgia mean the jury could still be out on Ireland's first-choice centre pairing.

Ireland boss Schmidt can keep his cards close to his chest until the Six Nations then, on just who will be anointed as the now-retired O'Driscoll's long-term successor.

Henshaw produced a gritty defensive display in his first cap on Irish soil against the Springboks, leaving Schmidt to ask for more of the same against Australia.

'I don't know if you can ask too much more of Robbie,' said Schmidt.

'I thought he delivered a really solid performance against South Africa.

'It was very seamless, him moving into 12.

'At 13 there will be some different challenges: Israel Folau will be coming into that area, there will be some traffic for Johnny (Jonathan Sexton), Gordon and Robbie to cope with.

'Robbie must also link with the wingers and that will be another challenge for him.

'Robbie and Gordon spent a bit of time together when D'Arcy got back fully fit.

'They've had a little bit of time together, they've enjoyed two training sessions together this week, that's pretty much all we've had time to do.

'I'm just hoping they can feed off each other, connect and link really well, and make sure there's no space for some of those big Australian runners to come through.

'If they do that really well they'll have had a pretty good day at the office.'

Former Leinster boss Schmidt has warned Ireland they must fight for the right foundations before trying to launch their offloading game.

'I hope we get more ball than against South Africa: when you are struggling to win the ball and win collisions it's hard to get the offloading game going,' said Schmidt.

'Offloading only works when you're going forward.

'We've seen Robbie and Gordon get good balls away through the contact, so if that's something we can manufacture, get that front foot ball, then I'd be delighted if that allowed them to open up the game a little bit.'
