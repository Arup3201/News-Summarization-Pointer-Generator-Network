Chinese artist Pu Derong makes these incredibly intricate carvings on the most tricky surface imaginable - eggshells. 

The 40-year-old artist managed to teach himself the extraordinary skill of making three-dimensional images on the wafer-thin surfaces of eggs.

Mr Derong, from Dongzhuangtou Village in northern China, could not afford art school but after hundreds of broken eggs, he finally cracked it.

Fragile: Pu Derong, from a village near Zhuozhou City in China, has taught himself to make intricate three-dimensional drawings on eggshells

Delicate: Mr Derong likes to carve traditional Chinese symbols on to the wafer-thin shell surfaces

Mr Derong needs to keep a very steady hand, as one wrong move can destroy hours of painstaking work. 

He uses his artistry mainly to recreate traditional Chinese symbols and animals, such as pandas, peacocks and dragons.

Mr Derong, who started egg carving in 1995, has won several awards in various contests and exhibitions for his unusual skill.

Remarkable: The eggshells that Mr Derong manages to turn into miniature works of art are only around 3mm thick

Painstaking: The carving requires hours of concentration with a steady hand - one false move can ruin a whole day's work

Chinese culture: Mr Derong could not afford art school but has still perfected this unusual art form

Although egg carving is more commonly done using a fine diamond bit on an electric rotary tool, he manages to create the same effect by just using a carving knife.

He concentrates on carving the whole egg in one sitting, carefully following his sketched design on the shell.

Because of all the calcium in the surface, luckily the incredibly time-consuming and skillful process is preserved for a long time. They have recently become expensive collectors' items.
