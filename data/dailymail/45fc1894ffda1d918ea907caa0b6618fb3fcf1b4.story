Killer: Gary Sampson, a drifter who confessed to killing three people during a week-long crime spree, will get a new trial to decide whether he should face the death penalty

A judge has thrown out a death penalty sentence against a man convicted of killing three people during a week-long crime spree in America ten years ago.

Chief U.S. District Judge Mark Wolf ruled that Gary Sampson was denied his constitutional right to have his sentence decided by an impartial jury and that he is 'entitled to a new trial to determine whether the death penalty is justified in his case.'

Sampson, a drifter who was raised in Abington, pleaded guilty to carjacking two Massachusetts men after each picked him up hitchhiking.

He said he forced both men to drive to secluded spots, assured them he only wanted to steal their cars, then stabbed them repeatedly and slit their throats.

He then fled to New Hampshire, broke into a house in Meredith and strangled a third man.

The judge's decision was angrily denounced by the father of Jonathan Rizzo, one of Sampson's victims.

'I wish I could say I was surprised,' Mike Rizzo said. 'I'm not surprised, I'm extremely disappointed and phenomenally outraged at the fact that one manÂ  tried to overturn the good work done by so many people in coming to the right decision many years ago.'

In a motion for a new trial, Sampson's lawyers argued that three jurors had given inaccurate answers to questions they were asked during the jury selection process.

Wolf found that one of the jurors had intentionally and repeatedly answered questions dishonestly in an attempt to avoid talking about subjects that were painful to her.

She never disclosed, for example, that allegedly her husband had a rifle and had threatened to shoot her, that she had ended her marriage because of her husband's substance abuse and that her daughter had served time in prison because of a drug problem.

Wolf said in his ruling that if the 
woman had disclosed those things during the jury selection process, the 
court would have found that there was a 'high risk' that after listening to the evidence at 
Sampson's trial, her decision on whether to sentence Sampson to death 
could have been influenced by her life experiences.

Wolf said the woman would likely have been excused from serving on the jury.

'In essence, despite dedicated efforts by the parties and the court to assure that the trial would be fair and the verdict final, it has now been proven that perjury by a juror resulted in a violation of Sampson's constitutional right to have the issue of whether he should live or die decided by twelve women and men who were each capable of deciding that most consequential question impartially,' wrote Wolf, who presided at Sampson's trial.

But Mr Rizzo disagreed with the reasoning, saying that he does not believe Wolf's decision was based on a desire to get it right.

'I believe Judge Wolf is trying what he thinks is good for his image and himself, he doesn't care about anybody else,' he said.

'It's clear it's been on his agenda for six years based on his action since the trial ended to do everything he could to ensure this is overturned and did not happen on his watch.

'I've heard and seen so many things from the judge over the years to be surprised at this, but, again, unfortunately, I'm very disappointed in the outcome.

'I feel terribly for the jurors who found themselves in this position through, I don't think, any willful deceit on their part.'

Sampson was the first person sentenced to death in Massachusetts under the federal death penalty law.

Massachusetts, which does not have a state law permitting the death penalty, has not executed anyone in more than half a century.

Sampson pleaded guilty to federal charges in the carjacking and killing of Jonathan Rizzo, a 19-year-old college student from Kingston, and Philip McCloskey, 69, of Taunton, in July 2001.

A federal jury in Boston recommended the death penalty after hearing weeks of gruesome testimony about the killings.

Separately, Sampson pleaded guilty in state court in New Hampshire in the killing of Robert Whitney, 58, of Concord, a former city councilor.

Sampson received a life sentence in Whitney's death.

'Gary Lee Sampson has admitted to the cold-blooded murders of Philip McCloskey, Jonathan Rizzo and Robert Whitney. Today's order does not change that fact,' U.S. Attorney Carmen Ortiz said in a statement.

Ortiz said prosecutors will meet with the
victims' families to discuss the ruling and plan to 'examine all of our
legal options.'

Christina DiIorio-Sterling, a spokeswoman for Ortiz, said: 'We are strongly considering an appeal as one of the options.'

But Mr Rizzo said he was not sure whether he could go through a trial again.

'I don't know how I'd do that, how to do that at the moment,' he said. 'I can't imagine dragging all that drama and all of those things, how that'd feel - to drag all that stuff to the surface again and have to deal with it for what would be the fourth or fifth time for us, given all the hearings we've been through.'

During the trial's sentencing, Sampson's lawyers said he was abused as a child and suffered from bipolar disorder, damage to the frontal lobe of his brain, and drug and alcohol addiction.

Former U.S. Attorney Michael Sullivan, who brought the case against Sampson, said he is disappointed that Sampson will get a new death penalty hearing.

'I feel horrible for the victims' families,' Mr Sullivan said.

'Sampson is an admitted cold-blooded killer and he deserves the death sentence that the jury imposed,' he said.

Wolf had ordered that the execution be carried out in New Hampshire - the closest state with a death penalty - to make it more accessible to Sampson's victims.

New Hampshire has a death penalty, although it hasn't executed anyone since 1939.
