'It's a story that's filled with crazy coincidences, twists of fate and OMGs! One of these days I'll write a book and no one will believe it. If it hadn't happened to me, I wouldn't believe it myself!' 

'I'm so lucky to have found my biological parents and even more blessed to have been able to develop wonderful relationships with them and my new found siblings. It amazes me every day,' she said. 

Hirst's childhood girlfriend was faced with a tough decision when she became pregnant with O'Shea as a teenager.

Jay O'Shea was adopted by a loving family in Adelaide

Speaking to The Sunday Telegraph, Hirst said his girlfriend was sent to Adelaide by her parents to have the baby. 

Their baby daughter was born on January 17 ,1974 in the Memorial Hospital in North Adelaide. 

As soon as O'Shea was born, she was removed from her mother and father, without them even knowing if she was a boy or girl. 

Hirst and his childhood sweetheart parted ways after their baby girl was adopted and he joined the band Midnight Oil. 

Midnight Oil went on to enjoy phenomenal success in the Australian charts, with 

'My girlfriend told me that because all the names had been changed and the secrecy was so great that neither of us should ever expect to ever find this child ever again. to forget about it and go on with our lives as if it never happened,' Hirst told The Sunday Telegraph. 

Rob Hirst said he had lost hope that he would be reunited with his daughter after her birth documents were forged 

O'Shea was adopted by a loving family in Adelaide and she grew up with two big brothers and besotted parents.

They named her Kylie Smith.  

However music was never far from O'Shea's mind and she moved to Sydney when she was 19-years-old to pursue a career in the music industry.

She worked as a backing vocalist for INXS for a number of years before meeting her husband Mark O'Shea while she was in London. 

The couple moved to Nashville in 2007, the home of country music.

They set up their life there and have two adorable daughters.

The couple, who perform today as O'Shea, won a Golden Guitar for Best New Talent in 2012.

Although O'Shea still had a constant burning desire to contact her biological parents.

All of her birth documents had been fabricated and she held out little hope that she would find any trace of them. 

One day she received a call from her mother claiming that investigators had found her birth mother. 

While her birth mother did not want her identity to be revealed, she did  reveal that her father was the famous drummer.

This hit O'Shea hard as she had firmed a strong friendship with Hirst's bandmates Midnight Oil's bassist Bones Hillman and his wife Denise.

Hillman eventually introduced the pair over a phone conversation and the beginning of their journey started. 

Hirst has two daughter, Lex and Gabriella, from his marriage to his wife Leslie Holland.  

O'Shea said she feels 'incredibly blessed and loved' to have found her true identity. 

'My hope is that it may inspire others who are in the same boat to take that leap of faith, with a come-what-may approach and an open heart. You just never know what new beginnings may be out there for you,' she said.  

O'Shea has recently rerecorded a version of the song a song originally written by Hirst and featured on his recent debut solo record called The Sun Becomes The Sea.

Hirst and O'Shea hope to perform it together when she is next back in Australia.
