The California family of a Vietnam veteran is suing a mortuary, claiming its loved one was buried without being notified.

Jamilah Pitts, daughter of Edward Pitts, claims she paid Simpson Family Mortuary nearly $1,700 to bury her father with full military honors at Riverside National Cemetery, KCAL9 reports.

The trouble began when family members reportedly received a date for the service which they could not attend. They say that Dr. Reginald Black, a contact at the mortuary, told them the date of Edward's ceremony could be changed.

The family claims that it followed up on the request - only to be told Edward had already been buried and the ceremony had not been paid for.

Jamilah Pitts told KCAL9 that they are not even sure if it's Edward's body that was buried.

'It’s just so, so hurtful,' she said. '[The funeral director] Dr. Black lied to us and promised us we could be there. Simpson’s robbed us of the chance to give papa our final goodbyes and they don’t even care. They don’t care. I can’t even visit the grave because I don’t know if my father is even really in there.'

The family is seeking $250,000 in damages for fraud, negligence and emotional distress, according to KTLA.

Trouble: this is not the first time Simpson Family Mortuary, pictured, has been accused of making a serious mistake. Two different women were reportedly placed in the wrong caskets in 2013

Dr. Black issued a statement on Monday denying that the company made a mistake and that its directors 'stand firm in our convictions that we will prevail.'

This is not the first time the mortuary has been accused of making a serious error.

In March 2013, Evan Davidson looked at an open casket meant to hold his late wife Darlene -- only to find the wrong woman inside.

Morticians told him he was mistaken, but later admitted they had their wrongdoing, KABC reported at the time. Davidson was called in three days later to confirm that Darlene's body had been placed in a casket for a different family.
