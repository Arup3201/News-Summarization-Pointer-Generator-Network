These stunning pictures show the incredible moment a killer whale flips a dolphin through the air.

The unique pictures show the killer whale, leaping out of the sea, like the famous scene from the film Free Willy.

An unfortunate dolphin finds itself in the whale's way and is sent somersaulting through the air by its giant fin.

The series of incredible pictures, showing the strange ways of the animal kingdom, were taken by Jodi Frediani.

The 65-year-old environmental consultant and photographer lives in Santa Cruz, California, where these spectacular shots were taken.

Mr Frediani said: 'The photos of the killer whale tossing the dolphin was taken about three miles from shore.

Impact: The huge killer whale had mistimed its strike, colliding with the dolphin and sending it skywards instead of sinking its teeth into the hapless creature

'I watched as the whales torpedoed through the water, but could not tell what they were hunting.'

The action was fast, the whale did a major tail throw, attempting to bat the unfortunate dolphin and moments later, she came up from below flinging the dolphin through the air.

'As I watched through my lens, focused on the female killer whale, I saw the dolphin flying through the air like a bowling pin.

'The vision took my breath away, according to the time stamp on my images, the toss took only one second.

'When travelling at speed like that, it is easiest for a killer whale to simply ram the dolphin with its head to kill it.

'Sometimes, the impact is so great and the trajectory just so, the prey flies through the air.'
