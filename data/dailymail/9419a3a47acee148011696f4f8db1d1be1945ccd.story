An underage worker has died after working '12 hours a day, six days a week' at an iPhone factory in China, it emerged today.

The 15-year-old - whose papers said he was 20 - suffered a fatal case of pneumonia after working for one month, said reports.

Shi Zhaokun was employed by Pegatron, a Taiwanese manufacturing company that produces the iPhone 5C on the Chinese mainland.

But his family say on October 9 Mr Shi couldn't make it to work and checked into a hospital. Soon after, he was pronounced dead.

His family claim Mr Shi worked 79 hours in his first 
week, 77 in his second and 75 in his third, all apparently in violation 
of the law.

Pegatron denies that the boy's death was related to his work schedule, the New York Times reported, but admitted several other young workers have died in the last few months.

Under Chinese law, at 15 Mr Shi was too young to work on a factory floor.

Labour rights activists in China have claimed there must be some connection between recent deaths and factory working conditions.

Li Qiang, head of China Labor Watch, told the New York Times: 'Considering the sudden deaths of five people and the similar reason of the deaths, we believe there should be some relations between the tragedy and the working conditions in the factory.'

A series of scandals have dogged Apple's supply chain in recent years.

Last year the iPhone maker
vowed to clean up its supply chain after a string of suicides and riots 
at Chinese assembly plants owned by Foxconn.

Apple then handed some of its lucrative assembly contracts to Pegatron and was hoping to put its scandal-hit image behind it.

But a damning report in July from China Labour Watch said conditions at three Apple factories run by Pegatron were 'worse than at Foxconn'.

A five-month undercover investigation found Apple's supplier broke 86 laws and regulations, with workers forced to do 70 hour weeks and more than 100,000 underage staff working on the production lines.

To meet the soaring demand for Apple's devices, Pegatron had increased its 100,000-strong workforce by up to 40 per cent this year.

But conditions at its plants were so bad that one in four workers abandoned their jobs in the space of just two weeks, the report said.

Apple said the report 'contains claims that are new to us and we will investigate them immediately'.

Apple did not provide an official comment on the latest allegations surrounding Mr Shi.

But in its 'Supplier Responsibility Progress Report', Apple states: 'For the past seven years, Apple has been publishing reports on the audits we perform in our supply chain.

'We do this because we believe in honestly sharing our findings — the good and the bad. We’re fixing problems and tackling issues that our entire industry faces, such as excessive work hours and underage labor.

'We’re going deeper into the supply chain than any other company we know of, and we’re reporting at a level of detail that is unparalleled in our industry.

It continues: 'To end the practice of excessive overtime, we now track weekly work hours for one million workers across our supply chain and publish the results on our website every month.

'And we share our work-hour strategy and tools with others inside and outside our industry. Although underage labor is rare in our supply chain, we report all incidents we find, as well as the actions taken to correct problems and prevent future occurrences.'
