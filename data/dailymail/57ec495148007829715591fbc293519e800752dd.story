A new video shows the moment that actor Dustin Diamond stabbed a man  on Christmas night.

On Thursday the actor - who played Screech on the popular nineties series Saved by the Bell - was arrested and charged with second-degree recklessly endangering safety; carrying a concealed weapon; and disorderly conduct, use of a dangerous weapon after getting into a fight at the Grand Avenue Saloon in Port Washington, Wisconsin.

After the  fight Diamond fled the scene along with girlfriend Amanda Schutz, who works as a clown named Loli Pop.

Officers soon located the two and both were taken into custody, where Diamond said that he was trying to close out his tab to avoid intoxicated people he thought were going to 'brawl' when he turned around and saw two men grabbing his girlfriend's hair as she bled.

As he went to help her he claims a man grabbed him and that is when the incident occurred.

In a police report obtained by CNN, it says; 'Diamond stated that he did not intentionally stab the individual in the bar but that chaos broke out and people were grabbing at him and that he swung his arms to break free.'

Other bar patrons are claiming 'a women was upset because people were taking pictures of her and her boyfriend,' and shoving broke out. 

This after TMZ claimed the Celebrity Fit Club alum and his girlfriend allegedly got into a dispute with another couple at the bar because they were being photographed, the website reported.

After the couple exited the establishment, things escalated when Dustin's girlfriend reportedly pushed the woman.

That is when the actor pulled out a knife, it was claimed.

The victim is reported to have suffered a half inch wound and bled heavily.

The couple who Dustin argued with then fled before authorities arrived, according to the report.

Authorities found the weapon in Diamond's possession in his car, and his girlfriend was booked on a disorderly conduct charge, though she was later released.

Dustin's girlfriend works as a clown in the area and goes by the name Loli Pop

According to Linked In, 'Loli Pop the Clown is fun, loveable, and the perfect entertainer for children of all ages'

He has not paid his $10,000 bond for release from a Ozaukee County jail and is claiming he acted in self-defense.

Meanwhile cops are hoping to get their hands on another video taken on the scene as the one they currently have is a little bit to shaky for them to clearly see the incident. 

According to state regulations, owning a switchblade or any 'blade which opens by pressing a button, spring or other device in the handle' is against the law.

He also appeared on the spinoff Saved By The Bell: The College Years, which was canceled after one season.

In 2006 he released the sex tape Screeched - Saved By The Smell. Later he told Oprah that he used a stunt double for the tape.

Dustin has been working in reality TV more recently.

He made an appearance in Hulk Hogan's Celebrity Championship Wrestling in 2000, Celebrity Fit Club in 2007 and Celebrity Big Brother in 2013.

In 2009, Diamond published an inside story of the show's cast and crew, from his point of view, titled Behind the Bell. 

In 2009 he also reportedly got married to Jennifer Misner, his longtime girlfriend, though a rep for the actor said the two are no longer together. 

In November he looked to be in good spirits as he co-hosted the Saved By The XIV party at the Bellagio in Las Vegas.

On Tuesday, Dustin made a return to Bayside High School in a parody segment for truTV's Friends Of The People, where the actor performed the role of a high school principal.

A rep for Dustin declined to comment at this time.
