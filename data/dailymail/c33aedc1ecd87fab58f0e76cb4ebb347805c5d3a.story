Alice Powell, a 21-year-old racing driver from Chipping Norton, is in contention to drive alongside the likes of Lewis Hamilton at the Abu Dhabi Grand Prix after her grandfather said he would pay to turn her dream into reality.

Powell, whose Formula One aspirations are supported by the Prime Minister, would become only the sixth woman ever to take part in a Formula One weekend.

Her opportunity has come about in extra-ordinary circumstances, after Caterham went into administration at the end of last month. The administrators have since launched a ‘crowd-funding’ project whereby the public can contribute towards a target of £2.35million that would allow the team, who have missed the last two races, to compete at the championship decider in Abu Dhabi on Sunday week.

Maria Teresa de Filippis: The Italian became the first female to race in F1 at 1958 Belgian Grand Prix.

Lella Lombardi: Another Italian, raced 17 times in 1974-76 and only female to achieve a top-six finish.

Divina Galica: The Brit was multi-talented, captaining women’s Olympic ski team in 1968 and 1972 and driving in three grands prix.

Desire Wilson: Qualified 16th for home grand prix in South Africa in 1981, but retired after her car was damaged.

Giovanna Amati: Rose through F3 and F3000 ranks, though she never qualified for F1 grid.

Since opening on Friday, the scheme has secured more than half the required money.

In return for contributing, the fans are given ‘rewards’ — including bits of old chassis, steering columns and sundry unneeded bits lying around the closed factory in Leafield, Oxfordshire.

Powell’s grandfather, Jim Fraser, a retired Royal Air Force sergeant, saw an opportunity to get Powell her Formula One debut. He wrote to the administrators, Smith & Williamson, offering to pay £35,000 in exchange for Powell driving in the first practice session on the Friday of the grand prix weekend.

‘I am really hoping the administrators come back with a positive response,’ said Fraser, an aviation lover who passed his helicopter pilot’s licence seven years ago aged 66. ‘It would give the whole sport a great lift and open people’s eyes to see a woman in an F1 car again.

‘A lot of women might not want to watch a race with their husbands when all they see is a list of men. This could focus their attention, just as it did when Danica Patrick raced in America. Audience figures there went up by 15 per cent overnight.

‘Alice is the best woman driver in the world and I believe she could run in midfield in a good Formula One team. But for now we are just trying to get a drive in one practice session.’

Mark Ford, an associate director of Smith & Williamson, confirmed they had ‘received the offer and have spoken to Alice’s backers’.

I understand that Ford sought an assurance from Powell’s grandfather and manager that she meets the criteria for an FIA super-licence, a prerequisite for Formula One.

She should comfortably qualify for the paperwork such is her pedigree in lower formulas. At 16, she was the youngest ever driver in Formula Renault UK before becoming the first female winner of a Formula Renault series in 2010. She has driven in GP3 and Renault 3.5, arguably the toughest series outside Formula One.

But despite her success, Powell, who left school after her GCSEs to pursue her driving career, works as a labourer — steel-fixing and driving diggers — when she is not racing.

Fraser says he is not cash-rich and fears his plan may be scuppered by rival bidders with deeper pockets. One driver available after his team Marussia folded is Britain’s Max Chilton, who is backed by hefty investors led by his multi-millionaire father Grahame.

But Fraser said: ‘Even if the administrators get someone else for the race, qualifying and the two other practice sessions, there is no reason not to include Alice for the first session. It is important that they make up their minds soon because she needs to get on the simulator from now until Abu Dhabi.’

Powell is no stranger to the limelight, having accompanied David Cameron on a trade delegation to India two years ago. The PM strongly supports her quest, saying: ‘Alice has my full backing in her desire to compete at Formula One.

‘No woman has raced in Formula One for nearly 40 years and not only would it be great for Alice and great for Britain but it would be great for Formula One.’

By taking part in two practice sessions this season Susie Wolff, of Williams, became the first female participant since Giovanna Amati failed to qualify for the Brazilian Grand Prix on April 4, 1992. And only two women have started a race: Maria Teresa de Filippis and Lella Lombardi, in the 50s and 70s respectively.

Speaking to Sportsmail last year, Powell, whose sporting heroes are Jenson Button and Jessica Ennis, said: ‘I don’t think there is anything stopping a female getting into Formula One, but I don’t think a female should be there simply because she is female.’
