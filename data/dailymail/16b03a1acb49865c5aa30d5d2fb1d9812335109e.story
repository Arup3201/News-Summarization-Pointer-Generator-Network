A grandmother has become Britain’s oldest banned driver at the age of 86 after being handed five speeding tickets.

Norah Lawley was caught doing 48mph in a 30mph zone while driving her Ford Focus in March - her fifth speeding offence in four years.

The retired primary headteacher had previously been caught breaking the speed limit on September 10 and December 5 last year, as well as August 7, 2011, and March 18, 2010.

Norah Lawley, 86, was handed a six month driving ban after being caught doing 46mph in a 30mph zone in March - her fifth speeding offence in four years

Lawley, who has four children, five grandchildren and one great-grandchild, appeared at Worcester Magistrates' Court on Monday after getting 13 penalty points, meaning a court has to consider a ban.

She pleaded guilty to speeding and Deputy District Judge David Noble banned her from the road for six months.

The most recent speeding offence happened at 12.36pm on March 30 when Lawley was taking letters to a person after they were delivered to her home by mistake.

The court heard she was flashed by a speed camera travelling at 48mph as she went on her errand in Upton, Worcester.

The judge endorsed Lawley’s licence with four additional penalty points, fined her £200 and ordered her to pay a £20 victim surcharge and £85 costs.

The mother-of-four, from Coombe Green, near Malvern, Worcester., was also ordered to re-take her driving test after she completed her ban.

David Ollivere, defending, said a small disqualification would be sufficient, avoiding the need for a ban under the totting-up procedure.

He said: 'Mrs Lawley lives in a remote and rural area with the nearest shop in Welland, Worcester, being four to five miles away.'

He added that of her four children, only one of them lived nearby and that the son had to care for his wife who had a severe disability.

Mr Ollivere said that if Lawley was banned she would be reliant on friends for transport.

He added: 'For a short disqualification the situation would be manageable but for a longer period would prove somewhat unbearable.'

Despite his pleas, the judge ruled her repeated law breaking warranted a ban. The DVLA has since confirmed Lawley is Britain’s oldest banned driver.

Lawley's solicitor argued that a ban would make it difficult for the mother-of-four to visit her relatives, three of whom live a long way from her home - but the judge Worcester Magistrates' Court (pictured) ruled otherwise 

According to official records the oldest person with at least 12 points on their licence is an 85-year-old man.

The oldest person to have any points on their licence is a 103-year-old man, and the oldest woman with a single point on her licence is 102. 

Neighbours of Lawley, who lives in a £300,000 home, expressed their sympathy today.

One said: 'This is yet another example of the courts using a sledgehammer to crack a nut. There are far worse drivers out there.

'We will rally round for Norah as much as we can and help her out as much as possible.'

Speaking from her  home today, speeding gran Norah Lawley said she was 'ashamed' of her ban.

She said: 'I don’t want everybody to know about it. I am quite ashamed. My solicitor has asked for it to be called again. He wasn’t happy with the result. I don’t know if it will but we will see.

'It is all a blur, a bad memory. Altogether I was caught three times in a year in the same place in Welland, coming through at more than 30mph. So I have to just put up with it. 

'I have had my licence cancelled so I won’t be able to drive until after Christmas. It is just one of those things. I have got friends who will take me around thankfully.'
