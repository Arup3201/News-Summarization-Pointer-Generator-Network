Uros Matic, the brother of Chelsea and Serbia midfielder Nemanja, is set to play for Macedonia, the Balkan nation's FA president Ilco Georgioski said on Saturday.

The 24-year old attacking midfielder, who played seven games for Serbia's Under-19s, visited the Macedonian football association headquarters and posed with the national team's number nine shirt alongside Georgioski.

'Matic drew our attention with good performances for (Dutch first division side) NAC Breda and will be a welcome bonus to the squad,' Georgioski told the Macedonian FA's website www.ffm.mk.
