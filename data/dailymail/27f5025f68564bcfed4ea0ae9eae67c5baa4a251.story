Formula One fans can already catch every moment of a thrilling race from all angles thanks to cameras tracking drivers every move.

But in future, thanks to new spherical 360 degree camera unveiled by a Norwegian firm, racing aficionados could actually interact with the footage and rotate the angle at will.

It allows the viewer to control the angle themselves using the arrows on their computer keyboard, switching from the view ahead of the car, to the right or left, or even hovering above the driver looking down at his helmet.

Red Bull Racing, who have teamed up with the camera's creators at Norway-based Making View, strapped one of the spherical cameras to an F1 car to showcase the technology.

Viewers can interact with the camera and switch the angle at the touch of a button while playing back recorded footage of the high-speed circuit.

The clip shows the driver steering the car in a 'donut' manoeuvre, and the 360-degree camera allows the viewer to see mechanics rushing up to the vehicle to spray cooling foam on the tyres.

Making View's ViewCam weighs just 600g and the firm claim it can be attached to things besides a car, including a helmet or onto an athlete's person.

The viewer can switch the angle to see either side of the vehicle
