Hana Khan has been found guilty of funding terrorism after sending boyfriend Jafar Turay £1,000 while he fights in Syria 

The girlfriend of a jihadi fighter is facing jail after sending £1,000 to Syria to fund his terrorist activities. 

Hana Khan wired the money to her boyfriend Jafar Turay after he sent her 'disturbing' photographs of children posing with AK-47 rifles in the war ravaged country.

The 23-year-old from Willesden, northwest London was found guilty of funding terrorism at the Old Bailey today. 

Turay, 28, fled the UK in 2012 after converting to Islam. He is wanted by British police on attempted murder charges said to have been committed before he travelled to Syria.  

During a two week trial, jurors heard how Khan, sent him £1,000 via Western Union transfer after telling him he looked 'beautiful' in a photograph taken with the Islamic State flag. 

She received three other photographs of children, thought to be under 10, posing with weapons in Aleppo. 

The 23-year-old was found guilty of two charges of funding terrorism. Anton Atkins, 31, was cleared of four charges of funding terrorism involving combat trousers and a total of £1,600. 

Prosecuting Chris Hehir rejected Khan's claim that she did not know Turay was fighting on behalf of Islamic State, describing the images sent to her as 'disturbing'. 

Referring to the co-defendants, he said: 'They knew that he had gone there to fight: in other words to use or threaten serious violence in furtherance of a cause,’ he said.

‘They knew - or at the very least should have suspected- that anything they gave him materially might be used in furtherance of fighting, by him or others.

'They are profoundly disturbing images because a deadly weapon is being put in the hands of young children who smile as if it is a good thing to hold an AK-47 or similar weapon.

‘He clearly has very little respect for the innocence of children.’

After receiving photographs of Turay posing with the ISIS flag, Khan told him he looked 'beautiful'. Anton Atkins, right, was cleared of four counts of funding terrorism after sending Turay £1,600 and a pair of trousers

The 23-year-old (left) will be sentenced next month. Atkins told the court he thought Turay was 'showing off' and that he had in fact gone to Egypt to study Arabic

The court heard how Atkins, from Woolwich, south east London, thought Turay was exaggerating in messages sent over the free service Whats App. 

In one, Turay, known as Joel Daley before converting to Islam, told him: 'get the loogah - as much as you can anyway - beneficial - u know this.’ 

But Atkins claimed he thought the jihadi was merely exaggerating and had gone to Egypt to study Arabic rather than join terrorists in Syria. 

He sent him £1,600 and a pair of black combat trousers.  

Khan however was found guilty of knowingly funding terrorist activities. She was released on conditional bail and will be sentenced on March 27. 

While the jury accepted she had knowledge of her boyfriend's intentions, Judge Gerald Gordon dismissed the idea Khan was an Islamic State follower or supporter. 

‘Unlike some she is not, in my view prone to fundamentalist beliefs herself,' he said. 

‘I think it is more the attraction of Jafar Turay.’

Khan will be sentenced for two counts of funding terrorism at the Old Bailey (above) next month
