A 23-year-old man has been arrested on suspicion of killing his parents inside their leafy suburban home where neighbours heard gunshots, it is believed.

Emergency services were called to reports of an attack at an address in affluent Solihull, West Midlands, at 5.15am today.

The bodies of a 58-year-old man and a 50-year-old woman were found at the scene and a double murder inquiry was immediately launched.

Probe: Emergency services were called to a house in Solihull at 5.15am today to find a man and a woman dead

West Midlands Police confirmed a 23-year-old man - who is believed to be their son - is in custody and was being questioned by officers this morning.

Detective Inspector Martin Slevin said: 'The inquiry is in its early stages but police are not looking for anyone else in connection with the deaths at this stage.'

Part of Hermitage Road was cordoned off this morning and two large blue police tents were visible outside the property.

Forensic officers in white suits could also be seen combing the road and house for possible clues.

This afternoon, police widened their 
cordon at the scene yesterday to seal off more of the road after 
speculation part of the incident happened in the street outside the 
family home.

Shocked residents of the street - where 
property values average £200,000 - said they believed the family 
involved had children and were from Vietnam.

Many claim to have heard gun shots.

Jo Green, 20, said: 'My mum heard gunshots this morning.  They woke her up, scared.

'I used to walk down the road every day. Now I will think twice about walking down there. It's awful.

'He used to go to school with my brother. I cannot believe it.'

A local man, who did not want to be named, added: 'He been arrested on suspicion of killing his mum and dad.'

Arrest: A 23-year-old, a close relative of the victims, is in custody being questioned over the deaths

Investigation: Shocked residents in the leafy suburb said nothing like this ever happens in Solihull

One neighbour said: 'I believe a couple lived there with children and they seemed to be from a Far East background.

'They have live there for more than five years and kept themselves to themselves.

'I have not seen them a great deal of them. It is usually a very friendly street, which is also quiet and peaceful.

'This is all very mysterious.

'The first I knew of it, was early this morning when police had erected a tent outside the house.'

Darryl Birch, 32, added: 'It concerns me a lot because this usually is a quiet area.

'Clearly, the investigation is very serious so it really worries me. It's dreadful.

Police are working to identify the couple, who neighbours say are from Vietnam and live with their children

'We have a lot of young families living here so it must be so terrible for them.

'They will, like myself, certainly think twice about going out at night around here now.

'It's very upsetting.

'My thoughts go out to the family concerned.'

Theo Sotiriou, owner of Theo's Food opposite Hermitage Road, said: 'It is ironic that Solihull was actually voted the best to live in the UK not so long ago and now look.

'It is really shocking.'
