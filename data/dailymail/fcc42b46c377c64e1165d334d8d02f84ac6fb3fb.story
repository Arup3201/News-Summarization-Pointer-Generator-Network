Two Norwegian MPs have nominated NSA whistle-blower Edward Snowden for the Nobel Peace Prize 2014.

Bård Vegar Solhjell and Snorre Valen, both parliamentary representatives of Sosialistisk Venstreparti, the Socialist Left Party, argue that Snowden’s release of classified documents has made the world a safer place.

In their nomination, both Solhjell and Valen say that Snowden damaged international security interests, but that this was just for the short term.

Prized man: National Security Agency whistle blower Edward Snowden has been nominated for the Nobel Peace Prize by two Norwegian politicians

'Modern information technology brings new opportunities for democratisation, openness and freedom of speech,’ Mr Valen wrote on Manifest Tidskrift. 'But is also introduces new tools for oppression, surveillance and espionage.

‘Of course I don't support all of Snowden's revelations, but I have no doubt that the public debate and the political changes that has followed in the wake of the Snowden issue has contributed to a more peaceful and better world.’

Mr Solhjell, a former education and environment minister for the Socialist Left party, said Snowden's revelations deepened the public's understanding of the extent to which states spy on their own citizens.

Publishing their nomination in full on Manifest Tidskrift, Solhjell and Valen acknowledge that Snowden ‘may have damaged the security interests of several nations in the short term.’

‘We are, however, convinced that the public debate and changes in policy that have followed in the wake of Snowden’s whistleblowing has contributed to a more stable and peaceful world order.'

Still hiding: Edward Snowden, 30, who is living protected by temporary asylum in Russia, has revealed he has received threats against his life in the wake of his intelligence leaking scandal

‘His actions have in effect led to the reintroduction of trust and transparency as a leading principle in global security policies. Its value can’t be overestimated.

‘A country’s legitimate need for reliable intelligence to preserve its own security, must always be balanced against the people’s individual freedoms – and the global need for trust – as an integral condition for stability and peace. Edward Snowden has made a critical contribution to restoring this balance.

Snowden, living in temporary asylum in Russia after disclosing U.S. government secrets on surveillance programmes and other activities, faces criminal charges in the United States after fleeing last year first to Hong Kong and then Russia.

Thousands of people around the world are eligible to nominate candidates for the Nobel Peace Prize, including any member of any national assembly.

There were 259 nominees for last year's prize, which was won by the Organisation for the Prohibition of Chemical Weapons for its efforts to eliminate Syria's chemical arsenal.

The Norwegian Nobel Committee will collect nominations for the 2014 prize until Saturday, and the list will be finalised when the committee holds its first meeting of the year in March where members also submit their own nominations.

The winner is announced in October.
