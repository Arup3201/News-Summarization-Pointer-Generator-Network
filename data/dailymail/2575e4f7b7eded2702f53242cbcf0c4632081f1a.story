A bouncer who left a handyman permanently brain damaged with a single punch to the head has been jailed for just 16 months.

Scott Taylor, 42, was left disabled and in need of full-time care after a punch caused the father-of-three's skull to collapse inwards outside Bar Station in Wellington, Shropshire in August 2012.

Mr Taylor's' family branded the 16 month prison sentence given to Neil Hotchkiss, 33, 'ridiculous' and an 'utter disgrace', after the bouncer admitted grievous bodily harm at Shrewsbury Crown Court.

Mr Taylor had been out drinking at Bar Station in Wellington on a Friday night when father-of-eight Hotchkiss asked him to leave the establishment.

After a brief exchange of words, Hotchkiss punched Mr Taylor, knocking him out cold with a single punch and causing him to collapse on the pavement.

Mr Taylor was taken to the University Hospital of North Staffordshire in a critical condition and placed on a life support machine.

The grandfather-of-one had suffered a skull fracture and extensive brain damage from the fall, with the injuries leaving him in need of a wheelchair for the rest of his life.

Mr Taylor was also left with a shocking dent in the side of his head caused by his skull collapsing, with the injury needing to be filled out with fat from his stomach.

Jailed: Neil Hotchkiss admitted grievous bodily harm at Shrewsbury Crown Court

Speaking after Hotchkiss was jailed for 16 months at Shrewsbury Crown Court yesterday, Mr Taylor's daughter Kirsty, 19, branded the sentence an utter disgrace.

'It’s just ridiculous. There’s shoplifters that get longer than that... My dad’s life is ruined, he can’t get up, he can’t get out of bed himself, he can’t even sit up himself,' she said.

'I remember it like it was yesterday. The police knocked on the door at 4am and rushed me to hospital. He was in intensive carer and they didn’t think he was going to survive,' she added.

Ms Taylor, who is now her father's full-time carer, said he was kept on a life support machine for a long time after the punch.

She said that until her father's skull was reconstructed, it looked like half his head was missing.

Mr Taylor has since had a stroke, although doctors can't be certain if that was linked to the injuries.

'I’m just so angry that it’s such a short sentence...He was using the sob story in court that he has got eight kids,' Ms Taylor said.

'Dad just says the same as me that it is ridiculous and he is angry too - it is an utter disgrace,' she added.

Since the attack, Mr Taylor has had to move from his home to a warden-assisted bungalow.

He is visited by professional carers four times a day, with Ms Taylor also spending eight hours at the property.

'His speech is affected, you probably wouldn’t be able to speak him and understand him if you didn’t know him,' she said.

'He can pick up the drink and have a drink but he can’t feed himself and he can’t move around himself,' Ms Taylor added.

'My dad has a life sentence and will always be like this and it affects his three children too,' she said.

Prosecutor Andrew Wilkins told the court Hotchkiss paced up and down after the blow and made no effort to help Mr Taylor.

He also said the bouncer initially lied to police and said he had not touched Mr Taylor.

Mr Wilkins added: 'Mr Taylor was clearly not doing what he had been told to do but, on the other hand, he was not being violent or aggressive.'

'Hotchkiss dramatically overreacted and the consequences were very dramatic.

'Mr Taylor collided heavily with the pavement and suffered a skull fracture and extensive brain damage.'

Sentencing Recorder Adrian Jack told him: 'As far as the Taylor family are concerned, any sentence I pass on you will be grievously inadequate for the very serious injuries suffered by Mr Taylor.'

'He will never make a full recovery. I have to accept, however, that you did not intend to cause this sort of injury.'
