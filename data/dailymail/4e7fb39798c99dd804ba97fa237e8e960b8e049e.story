The tenants who last year found out that they had been living with the dead bodies of a murdered couple buried in their garden have said they have no intention of moving.

Sue Bramley said she and her 15-year-old daughter, who live at the property in Mansfield where Susan and Christopher Edwards shot and killed William and Patricia Wycherley in 1998, will not move out.

Ms Bramley spoke out as the Edwards, who successfully hid their crime for 16, were sentenced to life in prison for the murders and unlawful burials of William, 85 and 63-year-old Patricia.

Behind bars: Susan and Christopher Edwards have been sentenced to life in prison after being found guilty of killing her parents William and Patricia Wycherley in Mansfield, in 1998

‘A lot of people have said, “How can 
you possibly still live there?”,’ she told the BBC. ‘But I love our 
home. We have got a great garden and we have had a lot of happy times 
here.'

Ms
 Bramley said she ‘never really thought anything’ of the area in her 
garden where grass would not grow, where it would later emerge the 
Wycherleys had been buried in a shallow grave just a few feet down.

‘We
 used to have birthday parties in the garden, which my young nieces and 
nephews used to come to and they used to dig in that area.

My nephew would bury his cars and my niece would have to dig to find them and I just think, “how close, how close”.’

For
 years, Susan, 56, and Christopher, 57, kept claiming the Wycherleys' 
benefits, stealing £245,000 from them, and conning friends and relatives
 that they were still alive.

No clue: The current tenant of the house where the Wycherleys were murdered and buried has said she never gave much thought to the patch in her garden where grass would not grow

Not moving: Ms Bramley has said that despite having lived with two bodes leaving their home

The
 Edwards, who were found guilty of murder last week, have to serve a 
minimum of 25 years behind bars, a judge at Nottingham Crown Court 
ruled.

Sentencing the pair, 
Mrs Justice Kathryn Thirlwall said the Edwards had created ‘an elaborate
 charade’ which ran for 15 years to deceive family and neighbours as to 
what had happened to the Wycherleys.

She
 said the facts of the case were ‘so serious and your culpability so 
high’ that she had no choice but impose minimum terms of 25 years each, 
for each of the two murders, to run concurrently.

The
 court heard that the debt-ridden couple shot their victims at their 
home in Mansfield, Nottinghamshire on the May bank holiday, with the 
couple then buried in a metre-deep hole in their own back garden.

For the next 15 years, the couple kept up the elaborate hoax that Mr Wycherley, 85, and his 63-year-old wife were alive.

The
 debt-ridden pair made it appear as though the ‘reclusive’ Wycherleys 
were still alive and had simply moved away, faking their signatures on 
official documents, and sending Christmas cards and letters apparently 
from them to family members.

As
 a result, they were able to rake in almost £250,000 in pensions, 
credit, and the sale of the Wycherley’s home - much of which 
celebrity-obsessed Susan, who also felt her parents had ‘swindled’ her 
out of a £10,000 inheritance in the 1970s, spent on correspondence 
signed by her favourite stars.

The
 56-year-old was fixated with powerful older men - including Hollywood 
actors Gerard Depardieu and Gary Cooper, legendary football manager Bill
 Shankly, entertainer Frank Sinatra, and political giants Winston 
Churchill and General Charles De Gaulle.

Shallow grave: The bodies of Mr and Mrs Wycherley were discovered wrapped in bedding in a makeshift grave in their back garden last October

The judge said the Edwards had created 'an elaborate charade' which ran for 15 years to deceive family and neighbours as to what had happened to the Wycherleys

Their
 elaborate plot did not begin to unravel until  2012 when the 
Centenarian Department of the Department of Work and Pensions wrote to 
Mr Wycherley, who would would have been approaching his 100th birthday, 
and asked for a face-to-face meeting.

The
 Edwards panicked and fled their council home in Dagenham, East London, 
to Lille in northern France, renting a flat which they paid for in cash.

Christopher Edwards, who could speak fluent French, attempted to find 
work but was unsuccessful.

By October last year, they were fast 
running out of cash. In desperation, Christopher, 57, called his 
stepmother, Elizabeth Edwards, back in the UK to ask for money - then 
went on the stunning revelation that the Wycherleys were buried in their
 garden.

Revelations: The judge accepted accusations from Mrs Edwards that her father, William Wycherley (pictured) had abused her

He also gave 
her the version of events that the Edwards to stick to during their 
police interviews and trial - but she called the police as soon as the 
conversation finished.

Stunned
 detectives then made the grim discovery of the Wycherley’s remains 
buried three feet beneath their former lawn, and contacted Christopher 
Edwards using phone numbers and an email address he had given his 
stepmother.

He eventually 
replied and arranged to return to the UK, and the couple were arrested 
at St Pancras International railway station a month after the Wycherleys
 were unearthed.

The only 
possessions the Edwards, who had just one Euro left to their name, 
brought back was a suitcase full of celebrity memorabilia.

Included were
 five items of correspondence signed by the 1950s film star Gary Cooper,
 which Susan had splashed out more than £14,000 on during 2009 and 2011.

It
 was a sign of Susan’s obsession with celebrities, a fascination which 
the court heard even extended to writing hundreds letters to herself 
posing as the French actor Gerard Depardieu.

The
 fake 14-year correspondence, between 1992 and 2006, even deceived her 
own husband, with Susan acquiring a machine to make it seem as though 
the letters had a French postmark.

Despite
 stealing hundreds of thousands of pounds owed to the Wycherleys, 
including selling their home complete with its macabre secret for 
£66,000 in 2005, the Edwards remain deep in debt, owing around £160,000 
to creditors.

Sentencing the couple on Monday, Mrs Justice Thirlwall described the killings as ‘shocking crimes’.

She told the ‘self-contained couple’ that so far as they were concerned ‘only the two of you mattered’.

The
 judge told Susan Edwards, who sat staring intently from the dock 
wearing a patterned grey cardigan and glasses, that she was ‘an 
accomplished liar and a fantasist’.

Mrs
 Justice Thirlwall accepted ‘on balance’ that she had told the truth 
about being sexually abused by Mr Wycherley as a child and that had 
formed the basis of the hatred she felt for her father.

‘That background may explain why you hated him, which you did, and why you have no remorse about killing him,’ she said.

The
 judge said she did not believe Mrs Wycherley had ever known of that 
abuse, as had been claimed in court as being the motive for killing her.

Lies and deceit: A letter forged by the Edwards from William Wycherley asking that his benefits and pensions payments be paid directly into a numbered bank account, dated around six moths after the murders in 1998

Evidence: Police believe this Second World War Commando Colt .38 calibre revolver was used in the murders in Nottinghamshire in 1998

Mrs
 Justice Thirlwall added that she was satisfied it was Christopher 
Edwards ‘who held the gun’ and who shot the pensioners in the back 
bedroom of their semi-detached home, and not as the couple claimed, 
Susan Edwards.

During 
mitigation pleas, Susan Edwards’s barrister David Howker QC described 
her abuse at her father’s hands as ‘an ongoing feature’ of her life 
‘that created in her, some would say, the justifiable hatred of him and 
would be akin to a slow-burning, festering provocation that may explain 
in some way some part of why it happened’.

Mr
 Howker spoke of the ‘disdain’ his client alleged her father had then 
shown her in later life, including ‘his rejection of the only man in her
 life, and the man she loved, Christopher Edwards’.

He
 said Mrs Edwards had no children, no friends and was facing the 
prospect of jail apart from her husband, adding that her crime ‘already 
made her a target’ behind bars, although he did not elaborate.

Mr
 Howker added: ‘The upshot is she will effectively serve her prison term
 in circumstances akin to isolation, and from her point of view she will
 be parted from her husband, which is undoubtedly a life punishment.’

Mrs
 Justice Thrilwall said that she sentenced the pair ‘on the basis that 
each of you intended that both Mr and Mrs Wycherley should be shot 
dead.’

She added their 
sentences had to reflect the serious nature of the double killing, 
telling them they had planned to shoot their two victims - one of whom 
was in his 80s - for financial gain.

For
 the offences of obstructing a coroner and theft, both of which the 
couple admitted before trial, they were each handed a prison term of 
five years and four years respectively, to run concurrently.

Neither defendant appeared to react as they were jailed, with the pair led down from the dock in silence.
