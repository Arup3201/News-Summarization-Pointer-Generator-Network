A vintage motorbike of the same model as that ridden by the swashbuckling British Army officer immortalised as Lawrence of Arabia has emerged for sale after eight decades.

The rusty 1925 Brough superior SS-80 has been in the same family since it was bought new directly from maker George Brough.

TE Lawrence - Lawrence of Arabia - loved the bikes and famously died on one near to his home in Dorset in 1935.

This classic Brough superior SS-80 motorbike that has been locked away in a garage since 1930 after just five years of use has emerged for sale

The machine was put through its paces 
for the first five years of its life before its owner placed it in his 
garage at his home in Kent - and it has remained there ever since.

It was recently wheeled out of storage for the first time in eight decades after the late owner’s son decided to sell it.

The 'barn-find' motorcycle has all its original parts and when air was pumped into its 87-year-old tyres, they inflated.

Its re-emergence has delighted experts as there are very few original surviving models of the Brough SS-80.

Despite its run-down condition, it is being tipped to sell for at least £75,000.

George Brough was the son of a motorcycle maker but when he wanted to concentrate on high performance machines there was a disagreement.

George set up his own firm and made 
'Brough Superiors', a name that angered his father, but has delighted 
enthusiasts ever since.

This 1925 machine was guaranteed to go at 80mph and would have cost £150 new, a large amount back then.

It retains traces of its original black paint and has its number plate - XY6896 - mounted above the front wheel.

The bike, that has a 981cc engine, is being sold by auctioneers Bonhams on October 21 at the Staffordshire Showground.

Ben Walker, from the saleroom, said: 
'It’s a stunning bike. When you think there can’t be any more to be 
discovered this one turns up.

'It has been in the same family since new and from 1930 has been kept in a garage, untouched.

'We’re not sure why it went off the road five years after it was bought, but there might have been a problem with the gearbox.

'Enthusiasts will be drooling over its condition and the level of originality, it’s amazing.

'Nothing has seemingly been done to it and it also comes with history files showing correspondence between the owner and George Brough.

'In 1929 the bike was taken to a 'Brough gymkhana', which was like a motorcycle club gathering, and there is a programme from that.

'To get this level of history and documentation is very rare.

'It will need to be recommissioned mechanically and sympathetically. I would just smother the bodywork in oil so it doesn’t deteriorate further.

'When it was sold new it was a coveted item, and it still is today.

'It is not being sold for financial reasons, but for practical ones.'
