Passengers were delayed for nearly two hours when their allegedly drunk pilot was stopped at an airport before getting onto their flight.

The pilot, who was not arrested, was due to fly a Frontier Airlines plane from Omaha, Nebraska, to Milwaukee, Wisconsin, on Thursday.

But a hotel shuttle bus driver told police that he thought the pilot may have been drunk and unfit to take control of Flight 1894, due to take off at 6am.

On the tarmac: The pilot, who was not arrested, was due to fly this Frontier Airlines plane from Omaha, Nebraska, to Milwaukee, Wisconsin, on Thursday

The flight was a regional route operated by Chautauqua Airlines with 29 passengers, three crew and two pilots, reported ABC affiliate KETV.

Frontier Airlines said it is investigating claims that the pilot was impaired. The flight took off at 8am and landed in Milwaukee at 9:30am.

A Federal Aviation Administration spokesman said Frontier told the agency about the incident as required, but would not disclose the report.

‘Our police received information alleging that a Frontier crew member was impaired,’ a spokesman for Omaha's Eppley Airfield told ABC News.

Investigation: The morning flight was a regional route operated by Chautauqua Airlines with 29 passengers, three crew and two pilots on board

Police questioned the pilot before 
turning him over to Frontier Airlines staff due to ‘reasonable suspicion that he 
was impaired’, he added.

Pilots are not allowed to fly within eight hours of drinking alcohol.

This is known in the flight industry as the ‘bottle to throttle’ rule.

Pilots in the U.S. are also banned from having a blood alcohol level of 0.04 per cent or above.

The
 pilot was never arrested by police and the flight took off two hours 
later after another pilot was called in to fly the Embraer 145.

Passengers waited in the airport while the situation was resolved.

‘Frontier and Chautauqua have a zero-tolerance policy for drugs and alcohol,’ a Frontier Airlines spokesman told Fox affiliate KPTM.

Aviation expert Dr David Byers told KPTM that instances of an allegedly drunk pilot are rare, which ‘speaks to the integrity of the pilot community’.

There have been 134 cases of allegedly drunk pilots reported over the last 12 years in the U.S., reported ABC affiliate KLKN.
