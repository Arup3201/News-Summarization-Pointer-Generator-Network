This week Jamie Laing and I have knuckled down to work quite a bit. The honeymoon period with New York City is over and we've had to get down to some hard graft.

Don't get me wrong, I realise that hard graft for us is probably not as strenuous as someone doing a double shift in a factory, but it's all relative.

There was still one social commitment that I had to make before Jamie and I decided to become monks – the birthday party of our good friend Emma Miller.

The Made in Chelsea stars took a break from filming for Emma Miller's (second left) birthday. From left, Mark-Francis, Emma, Jessica Stam, Nina Dobrev, Jessica Szor

I need to be clear now that we are just good friends – not friends with benefits, or boyfriend/girlfriend – just good friends. Unlike Billy Crystal's character in classic late 80s film When Harry Met Sally, I do think that it's possible for men and women to be friends without sex getting in the way and confusing things. I realise most people may find this hard to believe.

The party started at Tao restaurant, an amazing 200-seater gastrodome in the Meatpacking district of town.

Tao is one of the hippest restaurants in NYC and everyone who is anyone goes there. We passed Charlize Theron on the way in – and she looks even more incredible in the flesh than on film.

Sadly New Yorkers like to confuse us foreigners and often when a restaurant is a hit they will have an uptown and downtown version at either sides of Manhattan island. Sadly we went to the wrong one which meant we were quite late.

By the time we arrived the food was already served - spicy tuna tartare on crispy rice, Thai crab cakes with mango chilli sauce, sashimi of Kobe beef with fresh wasabi sauce, it was superb and there was lots of it.

We sheepishly filled the two empty seats at the table and introduced ourselves quietly. I've got to say La Miller is surprisingly well connected in NYC – at the table were actress Nina Dobrev from Vampire Diaries and Jessica Szohr from Gossip Girl, next to them was Twilight and Expendables star Kellen Lutz, supermodel Jessica Stam, professional racing driver James Rossiter, Emma's brother Michael, and of course the wonderful Mark Francis Vandelli looking impeccably dressed as always.

I was a bit stumped as to what to get Emma as a present. I thought of getting some gorgeous Bluebella lingerie - Binky Felstead has just modelled for them and the collection looks amazing - but giving underwear might seem a bit presumptuous.

Party on: As the night wore on, Spencer and Jamie ended up at a private house party, they weren't sure whose house it was but the owner had won an Emmy

You can never go wrong with jewellery however - like handbags and shoes, it's something a lady can never have enough of.

At first I considered a pearl necklace but thought this may a bit over the top - we are only friends, after all. In the end I opted for some exquisite Vashi.com diamond and freshwater pearl earrings in 18K white Gold. They were well received.

A couple of espresso martinis had us in the mood for dancing and we were whisked off to the Tao nightclub next door. The venue was amazing - high ceilings, amazing Japanese artwork and the feel of a 19th century Hong Kong opium den.

It was around 1am when we arrived and the place was jumping. We were given one of the best tables in the house because we were with A-list actors and actresses.

As the night wore on everyone started to get a bit loose and Jamie almost thought he was on a promise with Nina Dobrev but she jumped into a cab at 3am and broke his heart. 

The party started to thin out and so it was time to shoot to the after-party at a private house.

I'm not entirely sure where it was, or whose party but whoever owns the place has won an Emmy – the American equivalent of a TV BAFTA (which by the way I've won).

Hopefully if the the MIC NYC show transfers to US TV, I'll get to hold one of these for real as well.

Lots of love, Spencer.
