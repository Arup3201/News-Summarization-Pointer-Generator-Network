The BBC is to broadcast a series of poignant previously unseen interviews with First World War veterans that were deemed too ‘personal’ to be shown when they were originally recorded in the 1960s.

Rediscovered footage of Great War veterans talking about their first-hand experiences of the conflict will be shown in the documentary, I Was There: The Great War Interviews, on BBC Two next Friday night.

In the early 1960s, the BBC interviewed 280 eyewitnesses of the First World War for its monumental documentary series, The Great War.

However, according to modern documentary makers, the series concentrated on the battles and the politics - and moving personal reminiscences were not respected and in many cases left out.

Modern audiences, by comparison, would appreciate the emotional perspective, they said.

Using footage from these interviews, the new film illuminates the poignant human cost of the Great War, through the eyes of those who survived it.

One dramatic testimony relives the moment the men left the trenches and went over the top.

Richard Tobin, who served with the Royal Naval Division, said: ‘As soon as you got over the top, fear has left you and it is terror.

'You don’t look, you see. You don’t hear, you listen. Your nose is filled with fumes and death.

'You taste the top of your mouth... You’re hunted back to the jungle. The veneer of civilisation has dropped away.’

Another described the grisly reality of withdrawing over the battle ground after a day’s fighting.

Edward W. Glendinning, from Sherwood Foresters, said: ‘It was just like a flock of sheep lying in the middle of a field.’ he said.

‘Quite a number of the men were still alive and they were crying out and begging for water.

'They plucked at our legs as we went by. One hefty chap did grab me round both legs and held me.’

John Palmer, a gunner who was awarded the Distinguished Conduct Medal, admits how he tried to throw himself in front of a horse-drawn ammunition wagon to inflict an injury to get him out of the war.

He said: ‘I began to ease my way out and eventually the first wagon reached me. And do you know, I never even had the guts to do that. I found myself wishing to do it. But hadn’t got the guts to do it.’

These poignant interviews will be broadcast along with many others after 50 years in the archives and following the deaths of all those who took part, after BBC executives felt modern audiences would embrace the records of the soldiers’ feelings and emotions.

Mike Connolly, the executive producer, told the Telegraph: ‘The original program was very Reithian, concerning the battles and the politics.

'The worth of the personal experiences was not respected in the same way. The story of the men then were supplementary. Here they are the main focus.’

Thousands of soldiers responded to adverts in the 1960s to take part in the original 26-part series, which itself is due to be broadcast again later this year.

In total, about 70 hours of interviews were filmed, of which 55 hours survive, having been kept at the Imperial War Museum in London.

Julia Cave, the researcher who conducted the original interviews at Ealing Studios, said: ‘It has always been said that they [veterans] didn’t talk about the war, but there were a lot who did want to do so.’
