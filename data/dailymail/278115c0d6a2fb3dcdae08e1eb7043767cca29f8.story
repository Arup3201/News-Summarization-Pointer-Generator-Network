A crazed father allegedly caused an eight-vehicle wreck that killed another motorist - then fatally shot a man who walked up to the scene.

Thomas Lester Harper, 27, of Arlington, Texas, had his twin toddlers in his SUV and the boy and girl suffered minor injuries, police said.

He allegedly crashed into two cars, sped away and smashed into the rear of a pickup, killing the man driving that vehicle and triggering the wreck.

Suspect: Thomas Harper allegedly crashed into two cars, then smashed into a pickup, killing the driver and triggering the wreck, before he shot another man

Mugshot: Thomas Lester Harper faces murder and intoxication manslaughter charges and was put into an Arlington jail on Wednesday

Pile up: The crash allegedly happened while Harper's twins were still in his SUV

He then shot a man who walked up to the driver's side of his SUV - and it appears that man could have been a 'good samaritan', police said.

Witnesses Billy Ray Vaughn and Kaylee Mossman both  told the Fort Worth Star-Telegram they saw Harper 'laughing' as police took him into custody.

‘The big question is why this happened - whether it was road rage or something else,’ Sergeant Christ Cook told the Fort Worth Star-Telegram.

The suspect faces murder and intoxication manslaughter charges and was put into an Arlington jail on Wednesday. Police believe drugs were a factor.

Harper was also charged with child abandonment and endangerment. The 'good samaritan' shot lives nearby and wasn't in a vehicle, police said.

Investigators believe the SUV fled the scene with witnesses giving chase and trying to read the number plate, Sergeant Cook said.

With the roads wet from rain, it smashed into the back of a pickup truck, killing the man driving that vehicle and setting off the huge wreck, police said.

At some point, a man then walked up to the driver's side of Harper's SUV and was shot, Sergeant Cook added.

Witness Jason Welch said he thought that victim was aged around 25.

‘We're still trying to determine where this young man came from,’ Sergeant Cook said earlier.

Taken away: Armed police took away Harper after the deadly incident

‘If he's from one of the vehicles that 
were involved in the (first) crash or if he was just a bystander or a 
witness to the crash and walked up.’

Arlington Police spokesman Tiara Richard said it was a 'complex scene' because of the number of vehicles and people involved.

'We are still forming the background of what preceded the crash - who he'd been around - to form a true timeline of what happened'

'We are still forming the background of what preceded the crash - who he'd been around - to form a true timeline of what happened,' she told MailOnline.

The names of the men killed in the crash and shooting were not released soon after the accident by police.

But the crash victim was later identified by the Fort Worth Star-Telegram as Najee Nasir, 42, and the shooting victim as Clarence Robinson, 19.

'It hurts,' Mr Robinson's sister Jammie Pinion told WFAA. 'My heart is heavy, but I do know my brother died as a hero.'
