La Liga champions Atletico Madrid suffered a shock defeat to bottom of the table Real Sociedad, as the Basque side ended Diego Simeone's  winning streak with a late goal from Imanol Agirretxe.

The hosts, who are expected to unveil former Manchester United manager David Moyes as their new manager in the coming days, put in a much improved performance against the Champions League finalists, and in the end ran out deserving winners.

Carlos Vela was the star of the show, driving his side forward and scoring a magnificent curling effort after the hosts had fallen behind.

And Atletico were unable to hold on for a valuable point, in a game where they were often outplayed by a side with very different priorities in La Liga.

Atletico's task was made much harder by left back Siqueira, who picked up two bookings in the first five minutes after half time, both with unnecessary tackles, to leave his side in the lurch.

And despite struggling to break down the ten men of Atletico, Sociedad eventually earned the win, their first since August, when Agirretxe headed home from close range. 

At the heart of almost everything good the home side created was Vela. The former Arsenal forward committed defenders, played incisive passes, and was twice unlucky not to have been awarded a penalty, receiving instead a yellow card for diving and a bloodied mouth.

Still, neither the referee nor Mario Mandzukic's shoulder could deny him his goal, a spectacular curling strike from outside the box.

It had all looked so different after just ten minutes, when Atletico took the lead. 

Raul Garcia's cross from the edge of the box was the sort of delivery strikers can usually only dream of. 

Mandzukic, arriving at the far post, had a tap in from inside six yards, as two Sociedad defenders failed to cut out the inviting ball.

But Sociedad took just five minutes to hit back, and after Vela's strike they really should have gone into the interval ahead. 

First the Mexican was denied a penalty when Diego Godin appeared to have fouled him, before the Atletico defender performed heroics to deny Agirretxe, who had rounded the keeper but couldn't beat Godin's goal-line slide.

In the end, however, it would not matter. Siqueira's stupidity left his side exposed, and Agirretxe was rewarded for a night of hard work when he headed past Moya with eight minutes to go.
