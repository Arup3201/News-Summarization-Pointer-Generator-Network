The body of a mystery man found down a well by gardeners last week was dumped there two years ago, police revealed today.

The corpse is of a white man who was assaulted and bound before being thrown down the well in Warlingham, Surrey, tests have confirmed - although a cause of death could not be established.

Detectives have vowed to find the killers, and a forensic team will be at the scene for another month as they hunt for clues. The well has been partly demolished and water samples taken for analysis.

A Metropolitan Police spokesman said: 
‘A post mortem examination which took place on Sunday, 17 November did 
not provide a cause of death and further tests are being conducted.

‘However,
 the examination did reveal that the body - confirmed to be of a white 
male - has sustained injuries consistent with an assault prior to being 
placed in the well.

‘It has 
also been established that the body was bound up before being placed in 
the well by a third party. Detectives now believe the body had been in 
the well for around two years.’

He
 added: ‘Officers continue to investigate the circumstances surrounding 
the murder of a male whose body was discovered in a well in Warlingham.

‘Police
 were called after workmen discovered the body in a well outside an 
address in Audley Drive, Warlingham at around 13:50hrs on 15 November.

‘Specialist officers, including Metropolitan Police divers, attended the scene and recovered the body.’

Detective
 Chief Inspector Cliff Lyons, who leads the investigation, revealed: 
‘Our enquiries continue to try and establish the identity of this male. 
These enquiries have included reviewing missing person reports but this 
process may take some time.

‘I
 would like to thank the public for their positive response to our 
appeals so far and specifically those in the local community who have 
been supportive throughout the disruption caused by police and media in 
their neighbourhood.

‘Given 
the complex nature of this investigation, it is likely that forensic 
work at the property will continue for a further month as we attempt to 
secure all available evidence.’

Tents: The body was found in the narrow shaft of a well outside this house on Audley Drive in Warlingham

Gardeners working at the house, set within an acre of land, spotted the body in the well in Surrey

The
 investigation has so far seen the well where the body was found partly 
demolished and water from within the well taken for forensic 
examination.

'It
 has also been established that the body was bound up before being 
placed in the well by a third party. Detectives now believe the body had
 been in the well for around two years'

Metropolitan Police spokesman

Forensic work will continue on the well, the house and outbuildings at the property to establish as much evidence as possible.

DCI
 Lyons added: ‘While our work continues to establish the facts of how 
this male came to sustain his injuries and his body end up in the well, 
our focus is also on finding out his identity.

‘This
 is someone’s son and my team owe it to him and his family to find out 
the truth and bring those who committed this atrocious act to justice.’

Seven
 men, aged between 21 and 27, have been arrested on suspicion of murder.
 They were interviewed and subsequently released on bail on Sunday until
 a date in late December.

The arrested men are all Polish car wash workers who live at the house. One of the men said: ‘I want to clear my name. There has been a big mistake. We don’t know nothing. We just live there.'

Specialist divers, pictured, were called to the scene and were assessing how to remove the body without destroying any evidence

Evidence found by the divers at the scene indicated that the body had been placed in the well, police said

George Anastasi, owner of both the property and car wash, said he was ‘completely shocked’ when he heard of the discovery.

Rory Mulholland, 21, who was working at the property with 17-year-old Jack Duncan said following the body's discovery: ‘There was quite a lot of trash in the garden.

‘I assumed whoever owned the house was clearing the house out and getting it renovated and it was the end of their tenancy. We spotted a big blue tarpaulin at the bottom of the well.

‘We were curious to see what it was. Jack turned the tarpaulin over with a length of kitchen drainpipe and then we noticed the outline of a person.

‘You could see the shape of someone’s legs and a bottom. Then we flipped the tarp over again and I saw someone’s upper thigh. It was definitely a man. I’ve never smelt anything like it.’
