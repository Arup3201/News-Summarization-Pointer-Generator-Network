Ally McCoist is set to meet the Rangers board on Wednesday for the talks that will determine his point of departure from Ibrox.

The Rangers manager is expected to convene with football board chairman Sandy Easdale and Mike Ashley’s lieutenant Derek Llambias with legal teams of both parties present.

The midweek showdown is where McCoist will learn of the club’s response to serving written intent to quit at the end of the 12-month notice period on his contract — the move that stunned Scottish football on Friday.

McCoist could then be placed on gardening leave or have his contract settled at a cost of £400,000 in order to have the issue resolved before Livingston visit Ibrox on Saturday and next Monday’s Annual General Meeting.

But he could yet remain until the end of the season, with the balance paid in the summer.

Clearing out McCoist and his entire coaching staff, including assistant Kenny McDowall and No 3 Ian Durrant, would clock in at a fee of more than £1million for a cash-strapped club relying on Ashley loans to limp through the winter.

It remains to be seen if Ashley, who controversially handed Dennis Wise and Joe Kinnear jobs at Newcastle, is content to write the cheque and parachute a preferred candidate in at the first-team helm.

His man, Llambias, a non-executive director, has been implementing savage cuts at a lower level and not among the high earning staff — a move that left McCoist alarmed and helped precipitate his decision to quit.

From the clutch of front-runners to replace McCoist, the Newcastle owner is likely to find the name of Billy Davies for his consideration as the No 1 Scottish contender.

The former Nottingham Forest manager has upped his presence at Ibrox in recent months.

Davies has spoken previously of managing Rangers being his career ambition and, perhaps crucially for his immediate employment prospects, boasts an excellent second-tier record in England, including a promotion for Derby and Play-Off Final appearance with Preston.

McCoist ordered his players in for Saturday training in the aftermath of Friday night’s pitiful performance at Queen of the South.

That 2-0 loss did not see Rangers concede any further title ground on Saturday because leaders Hearts’ match at Cowdenbeath was postponed.
