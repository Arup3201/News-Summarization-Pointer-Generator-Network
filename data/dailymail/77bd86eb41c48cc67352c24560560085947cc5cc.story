Pop star Rita Ora posted a photo of herself last week having Vitamin B12 injected into her bottom.

She is the latest in a line of stars following this crazy fad, apparently as an energy boost.

Even for celebrities, this seems radical. Is it really a good idea?

B12 injections are important  for people with a deficiency and it is possible that Rita was prescribed this treatment.

However, for those with normal B12 levels, there’s no evidence it will help – and no proof it will replenish energy levels. Unless you have problems with your bowel, there’s no reason not to take a normal oral supplement.

Vitamin boost: Jabs are only needed by people who have a B12 deficiency

So why is Vitamin B12  so important?

This vitamin is vital for a healthy nervous system and blood cells.

It helps utilise energy from our food, which is possibly where the idea comes for fatigue-busting injections.

Usual sources would be animal products including meat, eggs, cheese and milk, plus fish and fortified cereals, so most of us already get plenty from our diet.

Why do some people have it injected?

The most common cause  of B12 deficiency is a condition called pernicious anaemia.

This is where your stomach lacks the right protein to absorb the vitamin from food. It leads to immense fatigue and breathlessness, and sometimes tinnitus.

As the condition means no B12 can be taken in through the gut, injections are vital and initially they are given three times a week to build up stores.

After that, a jab once every three months is usually enough to resolve symptoms.

What about the trend  for IV vitamin drips?

These intravenous drips are completely unnecessary  for otherwise healthy people.  A balanced diet is perfectly adequate for maintaining normal levels of vitamins, and if there is any dietary lack, a tablet is enough to rectify the problem.
