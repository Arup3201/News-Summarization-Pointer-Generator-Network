Motor racing legend James Hunt would be ‘horrified’ by the way he is portrayed in a new film of his life, says the lover who shared his final years.

The £100 million blockbuster Rush, which has its world premiere in London next week, focuses on Hunt’s time as a hard-drinking, womanising playboy, as well as his intense rivalry with Niki Lauda for the 1976 Formula 1 title.

But Helen Dyson, to whom he proposed on the day before he died, said Hunt came to be embarrassed by those hedonistic days once he settled down.

Settling down: James Hunt had left his hedonistic lifestyle behind him when he met Helen Dyson in 1988. She said he would be horrified by the portrayal of a hard-drinking womaniser in a new film about his life

She told The Mail on Sunday: ‘James would be horrified by that period of his life being the subject of a film. He used to refer to that time as “my seedy past”. It wasn’t a happy time for him, and he was so ashamed of it all.’

Now 47, Helen is speaking about their relationship for the first time as she feels her part in Hunt’s life story has been ignored.

‘To some people I don’t exist,’ she said. ‘It feels like history has been rewritten, and I’ve been airbrushed out. It hurts.

The James I knew was a totally different person to the one the public will see in the film. He was kind, gentle and sensitive.’

Helen, a highly successful artist, was also left with nothing when he died and was forced to leave the house they shared because the often-chaotic Hunt had not got around to updating his will.

She met Hunt in 1988, soon after his split from second wife Sarah, which was to become a particularly acrimonious divorce. 

Helen met James at a restaurant where she was a waitress. She was 22 and studying textiles at college in North London.

He was 40. By 1991, she had moved into his sprawling Wimbledon home. Over the years, James mentioned his hopes of marrying Helen and starting a family many times. 

‘It just wasn’t on my radar at that time,’ she says. ‘By 1993, though, we both knew it was going to happen.’

In June of that year, Helen took a holiday to Greece with her best friend. ‘It was supposed to be a last girls’ holiday before both of us started trying for a baby.

In five years, James and I had never really been away from each other. We spoke every day and during our last call, he proposed to me again.’

The following day, Helen received a call from one of James’s closest friends to tell her he had died, suddenly, from a heart attack. It was 1993 and he was just 45. 

‘I was 27 and I thought my life was all mapped out. Now my future, all my dreams, everything, were gone. I got home and just painted like a madwoman. Painting was my lifeline. He was planning to change the will, but he hadn’t got round to it yet. It didn’t seem urgent. 

‘James knew I didn’t like the age difference between us, so he’d always say, “Don’t worry darling, I’m going to outlive you.” We really believed that was true, because he was so healthy,’ she says.

Split: Mr Hunt with his second wife Sarah and son Tom in 1985. The two had an acrimonious divorce that cast a shadow over the domestic bliss he had established with his girlfriend

James’s house was sold, and Helen had to move back in with her parents. ‘It was then that what had happened started hitting home,’ she says. 

As the film is due to be screened, Helen
is too diplomatic to comment on James and Sarah’s divorce, saying only 
that she loved spending time with Tom and Freddie, his two sons by 
Sarah. ‘I was in my element with them, giving them art classes and 
taking them for walks with the dogs.’

Ashamed: Ms Dyson said James Hunt would be embarrassed by the way he is portrayed in 'Rush'- a new blockbuster starring Chris Hemsworth as the F1 driver and Olivia Wilde as his first wife Suzy

But The Mail on Sunday understands, from separate sources, that during the split Sarah accused her former husband of being mentally unstable and an unfit father whose elder son did not wish to see him.

At the time, Hunt said the battle was causing emotional trauma for his whole family – himself, Sarah, and Tom and Freddie. 

The case was still ongoing when Hunt died. 

The divorce cast a shadow over the domestic bliss he had established with Helen in suburban Wimbledon, South-West London, after he gave up drinking and smoking.

In 1988 – the same year he met Helen – he had bought a house for Sarah and the boys and began paying regular maintenance.

But the following year, Sarah 
enlisted lawyer Fiona Shackleton, who was to become famous for her work 
for Princess Diana and Paul McCartney, to fight for more.

In 1991, the divorce was finally settled in court, with James ordered 
to pay Sarah a lump sum of £45,000, maintenance of £2,500 per month, the
fees for the children’s school and nanny, and indemnity costs of 
£172,000. 

By the end of that year, the pair were back in court after James failed to pay all he was required to. 

He
said he couldn’t afford to pay as he was ‘broke’,  with most of his 
money tied up in insurance policies – and described himself as a ‘victim
of the punitive divorce system and greedy lawyers’. 

Hunt’s ex-wife Sarah refused to comment last night.
