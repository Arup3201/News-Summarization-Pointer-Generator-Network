The first new garden city for 100 years will be constructed in an attempt to boost housebuilding, it has been revealed.

Chancellor George Osborne said the measure will be in his Budget this week, arguing Britain needed to ‘get building’ in order to secure the economic recovery.

The new garden city will be built at Ebbsfleet in Kent, which will initially provide 15,000 homes.

It will be modelled on popular garden cities built at the beginning of the last century, including Letchworth and Welwyn Garden City.

The Government is to set up an urban development corporation, involving both private and public companies, to help build the new city, and offer £200million in public investment.

In addition, the controversial Government-backed Help to Buy scheme is to be extended until the end of the decade.

The idea of a new city in Ebbsfleet, which has a Eurostar train station, has been mooted for years but progress has been slow. To date, only 150 new homes have been built.

‘At Ebbsfleet there is the land available, there is fantastic infrastructure with a high speed line, it’s on the river, it’s in the South East of England where a lot of the housing pressure has been,’ the Chancellor said.

‘You’ve got local communities and MPs who support the idea. We are going to create an urban development corporation. There are already some home being built on the site, but on a much, much smaller scale.

‘It will be a proper garden city. It is not something this country has attempted for decades. That is one of the messages of my Budget.

‘Britain has to up its ambition, Britain has to up its game, Britain has to earn its way in the world. Yes, the economy is recovering but that is not enough. We have got to finish the job.’

But Emma Reynolds MP, Labour’s shadow housing minister, said: ‘The Government has had four years to make progress on garden cities but instead of getting on and building them, ministers have spent their time making empty announcements and suppressing reports.

‘We will wait to see the detail in the Budget, but people will want to know how (yesterday’s) announcement to build 15,000 homes in Ebbsfleet differs from the announcement to build 20,000 homes in the same place in 2012.

‘Labour is clear that you can’t deal with the cost-of-living crisis without building more homes.

‘That’s why Labour has committed to getting 200,000 homes a year built by 2020, including by building a new generation of new towns and garden cities.’

The Local Government Association, which represents almost 400 councils in England and Wales, expressed alarm at the Chancellor’s plan to set up a garden city and urban development corporation.

Chairman Sir Merrick Cockell said: ‘While we support the government’s aims to build more houses, democratically accountable councils have been at the forefront of delivering local growth and the creation of a separate, remote quango is unnecessary.

‘Residents will be concerned that such a body, unelected and accountable to central government, could have the power to make local decisions about investment, planning, development and possibly even local transport. These decisions should be taken at the local level.’
