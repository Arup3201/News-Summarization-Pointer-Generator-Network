Turkey is for the first time connecting its European and Asian sides with a railway tunnel, which is set to open today.

The sub-sea passage that runs below the Bosphorus Strait, will link the Asian and European shores of Istanbul for the first time.

The opening of the major engineering project marks the completion of a plan initially proposed by an Ottoman sultan about 150 years ago.

The sub-sea passage that opens today, runs below the Bosphorus Strait (centre) and will link the Asian and European shores of Istanbul for the first time

It is intended to ease traffic congestion and pollution in Istanbul as well as creating an important trading route, which connects China and Western Europe.

The tunnel is among a number of large infrastructure projects under the government of Prime Minister Recep Tayyip Erdogan that have helped boost the economy but also have provoked a backlash of public protest.

The tunnel is 13.6 kilometres (8.5 miles) long, with 1.4 kilometres (4,593 feet) running under the Bosphorus - the strait that connects the Black Sea to the Sea of Marmara and divides Istanbul between Asia and Europe.

The tunnel is among a number of large infrastructure projects under the government of Prime Minister Recep Tayyip Erdogan (third on the right).

Turkish officials say that at more than 55 metres deep, it will be the deepest submerged railway tunnel of its type in the world.

Officials hope that with a 1.5 million passengers a day, it will ease some of Istanbul's terrible traffic, particularly over the two bridges that currently connect the two sides of the city.

The project started in 2005 and was scheduled to be completed in four years, but was delayed by important archaeological finds, including a 4th century Byzantine port, as builders began digging under the city.

The tunnel has raised fears that it could be vulnerable to earthquakes in a region of high seismic activity.

But Turkish Transportation Minister Binali Yildirim said that it is designed to withstand a massive 9.0 magnitude quake. He calls it 'the safest place in Istanbul.'

Ottoman Sultan Abdulmejid is said to have first proposed the idea of a tunnel under the Bosphorus about a century and a half ago and one of his successors, Abdulhamid, had architects submit proposals in 1891, but the plans were not carried out.

The tunnel is just one of Prime Minister Erdogan's large-scale plans.

Others include a separate tunnel being built under the Bosphorus for cars, a third bridge over the strait, the world's biggest airport and a massive canal that would bypass the Bosphorus.

The projects have provoked accusations that the government is going ahead with city-changing plans without sufficient public consultation and the concern fueled protests that swept Turkey in June.

Today's ceremony at 1pm GMT falls on the 90th anniversary of the founding of the Turkish Republic.

It will be attended by Prime Minister Erdogan and other officials including Japanese Prime Minister Shinzo Abe, whose country was heavily involved in the construction and financing of the railway tunnel project.
