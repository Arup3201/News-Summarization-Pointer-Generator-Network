Australian women are increasingly choosing to save money by buying affordable cosmetics at supermarkets rather than paying a premium for designer brands from department and specialty stores.

And Daily Mail Australian can reveal Australia's two top-selling brands are Maybelline and Covergirl, which aren't offered at department stores such as Myer and David Jones, and can cost almost five times less than prestigious brands.

,For example, mascaras made by top cosmetic line such as Chanel, M.A.C, Benefit and Napoleon Perdis cost at least $35 each, while mascaras for Covergirl and Maybelline sell in supermarkets from as low as $7.62.

Recent figures from Roy Morgan Research found that now more than one in four women over the age of 14 are choosing to buy their cosmetics from supermarkets such as Woolworths or Coles.

The increase in the number of women shopping for cosmetics in the supermarket over the  last four years comes as sales in traditional stores for makeup, such as chemists, department and specialty stores, has fallen or remained stagnant.

It seems supermarkets are becoming not only the place to save money on groceries, but make up.

General manager of Roy Morgan Research, Geoffrey Smith, says stores such as Woolworths and Coles stock a wide range of popular cosmetic brands including Covergirl and Rimmel.

Coles also offers Aussie brand Nude by Nature while Woolworths stocks ModelCo.

Australia's top selling make up brand Maybelline is stocked at both stores, with mascaras such as the Colossal Mascara Black at 9ml which retails for about $21.49 at Woolworth and $21.67 at Coles.

Priceline also offered the same product for a lower price at about $19.95, despite research showing the number of women buying their cosmetics at the store also decreased by nearly two per cent.

A spokeswoman for Woolworths provided their top selling products, most of which were Maybelline costmetics.

Coles were unable to provide the same information, as they believed it would be 'commercially sensitive'.

However a Coles spokeswoman told Daily Mail Australia: 'People are turning to supermarkets for cosmetics because of the range, convenience and price. You don't need to break the bank for your beauty needs with some of our top sellers being mascara, eye liner and pressed powder as they offer customers great quality and value.'

Lower performing retailers, according to data released by Roy Morgan Research, are Australian department chains Myer and David Jones as staff at both stores told Daily Mail Australia they no longer stock Maybelline and Covergirl.

But Myer Group general manager of cosmetics, Liz Webster, told Daily Mail Australia that customers come to their stores 'for a leading range of prestigious cosmetic brands'. 

One of Woolworth's best selling products is Maybelline's Colossal Mascara Black 9ml (left), which sell for $21.49, while Myer's top seller is Clinique's Dramatically Different Moisturising Lotion (right) which retails for $49 at 125ml

Data from Roy Morgan Research reveals showed 25.6 per cent of women bought their make-up from a supermarket while one in every five - about 20.0 per cent - purchased theirs from a chemist

'Our cosmetic consultants have incredible product knowledge and we also offer a range of additional services including makeup tutorials, application,' Ms Webster said.

'We also give customers the opportunity to sample and trial cosmetics and skin care to ensure the product is right for them.'

Their leading cosmetic brands include Chanel, M.A.C, Benefit and Napoleon Perdis while their top selling product is the Clinique Dramatically Different Moisturising Lotion which retails for $49 at 125ml.

According to Roy Morgan Research, in the year to June 2014, 25.6 per cent of women bought their make-up from a supermarket which include Coles and Woolworths.

The study found one in every five women - 20.0 per cent - bought their cosmetics from a chemist.

Make-up shopping at discount stores such as Target, Big W and Kmart has decreased to 12 per cent as well as the number of women buying their cosmetics at Priceline stores - 13.6 per cent.

The proportion of women who buy their make up at Myer is at 11.8 per cent David Jones, is just under the 5 per cent mark.

Mascaras from these brands retail from about $35 while mascaras for Covergirl and Maybelline retail from about $7.62 at Woolworths and $16.50 at Coles.

Mr Smith says the increasing shopping trend at supermarkets comes down to convenience and costs.

'Although it might at first glance seem odd, supermarkets have been the leading channel for purchasing cosmetics for more than a decade,' he said.

'For women with busy lifestyles and multiple commitments, buying their make up at the same place as their groceries cuts out the need for a separate visit to another shop and saves them precious time.

'Bearing in mind that value for money is the factor most women consider important when buying make-up, retailers that offer cosmetics at a reasonable price have the advantage in this crowded and competitive market.'

The research - conducted over a six month period to June 2014 on 4,791,000 Australian women - further shows supermarkets have had the largest increase since 2010 compared to other retailers, jumping from 20.9 per cent to 25.9 per cent.

It also reveals one in every five Australian women - about 20.0 per cent - purchased their make up from a chemist.

Shopping at discount stores such as Target, Big W and Kmart declined from 14.1 per cent to 12.0 per cent.
