Former Manchester United starlet Danny Simpson tried to throttle the mother of his three-year-old daughter, a court heard.

The Leicester City right back, 28, is alleged to have carried out the attack on Stephanie Ward on December 29.

Mr Simpson pleaded not guilty to a charge of assault by beating at Manchester Magistrates Court on Friday afternoon.

Prosecuting, Kate Gaskell said: 'The police were called to a property in Worsley on December 29 as the result of a disconnected 999 call. When officers attended the door was open and they could hear the sounds of a struggle. When police got in they saw the defendant with his hands around Miss Ward's throat standing over her.'

At the pre-trial hearing Mr Simpson asked for the trial to take place on any Wednesday after May 11.

He was bailed and told not to enter Miss Ward's address or anywhere where she is living.

Contact with his child, he was told, must be arranged through solicitors.

The case is due to be heard on May 20. Mr Simpson is expected to give evidence himself as well as the officers.

The Eccles-born footballer came through the academy at Old Trafford. He made three appearances for the first team and had loan spells at Royal Antwerp, Ipswich Town, Blackburn Rovers and Newcastle United.

He signed for Newcastle in 2010 for a fee of around £750,000.

Simpson joined QPR on a free transfer before he was snapped up by Leicester City in August on a three-year deal for an undisclosed fee.
