It is an intensely personal question: what does it take to make you cry?

But for 100 actors, writers and other male cultural giants, it was no trouble to share the secrets that set them weeping.

Figures including Stephen Fry, Colin Firth, Patrick Stewart and Daniel Radcliffe have all revealed that it’s poetry that brings them to tears – and their most emotional picks have been collected for a new anthology.

Tear-jerkers: Daniel Radcliffe, left, and Stephen Fry, right, have both identified poems which bring a lump to their throats

Though my mother was already two years dead

Dad kept her slippers warming by the gas,

put hot water bottles her side of the bed

and still went to renew her transport pass.

...I believe life ends with death, and that is all.

You haven't both gone shopping; just the same,

in my new black leather phone book there's your name

and the disconnected number I still call.

...When he whom I love travels with me, or sits a long while holding me by the hand,

When the subtle air, the impalpable, the sense that words and reason hold not, surround us and pervade us,    

Then I am charged with untold and untellable wisdom - I am silent - I require nothing further,  

I cannot answer the question of appearances, or that of identity beyond the grave;    

But I walk or sit indifferent - I am satisfied,

He ahold of my hand has completely satisfied me.

For Harry Potter star Mr Radcliffe, modern poet Tony Harrison can reliably bring a lump to his throat with a touching portrait of a widower clinging to the memory of his dead wife.

His contribution to the collection is a pair of poems, Long Distance I and Long Distance II, published in 1978. The verses, written from the perspective of the grieving man’s son, tells how the older man keeps hoping that his wife will return at any moment, and keeps the house ready for when she does.

Of its closing lines, when the son admits that feels the same way about his departed mother, he said: ‘If the last line doesn’t bring you up short, you have a heart the size of a snow pea.’

The famous lines, some ancient and some just a few years old, were collected by father and son Anthony Holden and Ben Holden, and have been published in the anthology Poems That Makes Grown Men Cry, which was launched yesterday.

Emotional: Sir Patrick Stewart, left, and Downton Abbey star Hugh Bonneville, right, chose very different verses

Sir Patrick Stewart, famous for his 
Star Trek roles and countless theatrical performances, plumped instead 
for a poem describing the beauty of nature. In his entry for the book he
 described how God’s World, a 1917 poem by Edna St Vincent Milay, 
brought him to tears in the middle of the street with its depiction of 
autumn.

Speaking of the 
inspiring moment, which struck him in South Salem, an America town near 
New York, he said: ‘I walked two hundred yards down the lane and broke 
down helplessly weeping with the never-before-seen beauty and grandeur 
of it all’.

Meanwhile Stephen Fry chose 
verses by the great American poet Walt Whitman, who wrote about the time
 of the American Civil War. He described how the ending in Of The 
Terrible Doubt of Appearances by Mr Whitman ‘never fails to choke me.’

War poet: Downton Abbey actor Hugh Bonneville chose verses by Rupert Brooke, pictured, who is also a favourite of David Cameron

If I should die, think only this of me:That there's some corner of a foreign fieldThat is forever England. There shall beIn that rich earth a richer dust concealed;A dust whom England bore, shaped, made aware,Gave, once, her flowers to love, her ways to roam,A body of England's, breathing English air,Washed by the rivers, blest by the suns of home.And think, this heart, all evil shed away,A pulse in the eternal mind, no lessGives somewhere back the thoughts by England given;Her sights and sounds; dreams happy as her day;And laughter, learnt of friends; and gentleness,In hearts at peace, under an English heaven.

Other contributors include Downton Abbey creator Julian Fellowes, and Hugh Bonneville who plays Lord Grantham in the ITV series.

Poignantly, three of the contributors to
 the book – journalist Christopher Hitchens, poet Seamus Heaney and 
literary critic Frank Kermode – died while the book was being put 
together.

Mr Bonneville chose a war poem, The Soldier by Rupert Brooke, which contains the famous opening: 'If I should die, think only this of me/ That there's some corner of a foreign field/ That is forever England'.

Mr Brooke, a Cambridge academic and 
noted literary figure, tragically died in 1915 from an infected mosquito
 bite while en route to the ill-fated landing at Gallipoli in Turkey.

The
 Soldier, frequently featured in Remembrance Day commemorations, also 
emerged recently as a favourite of David Cameron, after he recorded a 
reading of the verses for an upcoming album commemorating the centenary 
of the First World War.
