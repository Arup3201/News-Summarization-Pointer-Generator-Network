Adam Moore, pictured leaving court, had failed to complete the divorce from his first wife before he tied the knot with second wife Lyndsay

A bigamist who married his second wife without divorcing his first has been warned he could face jail.

It was only when Lyndsay Haywood began divorce proceedings against her husband Adam Moore that she had discovered he was still married.

The 33-year-old, who has 'a complex' love life has now admitted a charge of bigamy. He was later seen holding hands with a mystery blonde woman as he left court.

Adam Moore had tied the knot with Lyndsay Moore in Bovey Tracey, Devon, in late 2008 before his first marriage was fully dissolved.

The court heard the marriage to Lyndsay, 37, had been a 'relatively short relationship' and despite the 'usual hopes and expectations it broke down'.

Prosecutor Chris Bittlestone said the second wife made the 'usual arrangements in December last year to unravel their contacts with each other' but she discovered that Moore had never been granted the final absolute decree - only the decree nisi which he said was 'only half way there'. 

Only part of the divorce had been completed but not the 'coup de grace' and the police were alerted.

Mr Bittlestone added: 'Mr Moore expressed himself to be single. (But) Lyndsay Moore never was a wife in the eyes of the law.'

Moore's solicitor Katrina Byrne told South and West Devon magistrates court in Torquay: 'Mr Moore back then had a complex life. And he has a complex life now.'

Mr Bittlestone said bigamy was a rare crime in the UK, and it was only the third time he had prosecuted it in 27 years as a lawyer.

'It is a serious matter. Marriage is an estate not entered into lightly,' he added.

He said that Miss Byrne's view was that this was not 'an outright deception'.

Miss Byrne said some cases of bigamy were more serious than others but this was not a case of a fraud or financial loss or someone with multiple families.

She said: 'It does edge into the custody threshold. But it is a complex set of circumstances.'

A pre-sentence report was ordered and Moore, who was previously in the British Army, was bailed until next month when he will learn his fate.

He left court holding hands with a blonde haired woman who had not sat in court to hear his case.
