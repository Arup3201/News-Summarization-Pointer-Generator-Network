Liverpool target Wilfried Bony has signed a one-year contract extension that will keep him at the Liberty Stadium until June 2018.

Swansea striker Bony joined the Swans from Dutch side Vitesse Arnhem in June 2013 for a club-record £12million and the Ivory Coast forward scored 25 goals in his first season.

The 25-year-old's impressive debut campaign in the Barclays Premier League sparked interest from the Reds, Arsenal and Tottenham last summer but Swansea were determined to hang onto their star striker.

'It's great news for the club,' Swansea manager Garry Monk told the official club website.

'I've spoken a lot about what Bony has brought to the club not just on the pitch but off it as well.

'These types of players are ones that we do our best to keep at the club for a long time but it's also important that we see commitment from that player towards the club, his team-mates and the fans.

Bony has scored four goals in 11 league games this season, helping lift Swansea to fifth in the table ahead of their trip to Manchester City on Saturday.
