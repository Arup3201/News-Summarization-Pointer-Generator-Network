The mother of a playboy killer who brutally murdered his girlfriend at his family's home is facing deportation after trying to cover up her son's crime. 

Anita Turner, 53, may be sent back to her native Indonesia after telling police that Emily Longley, her son's 17-year-old girlfriend, died in her sleep while at her house in Bournemouth in 2011. 

The teenager had in fact been strangled by Turner's son, Elliot, who flew into a jealous rage after seeing a photograph of the aspiring model with two topless men.

The then 23-year-old was jailed for life in 2012 after being described as a 'mummy's boy' in court. 

His mother and British national father, Leigh Turner, were jailed for 27 months after lying to police about the incident and destroying a confession note their son had written.

They were released in 2013 after serving half their sentence and have been living in the home where Miss Longley was killed since. 

Anita Turner, an Indonesian national, now faces deportation a year after being released. 

Under British law, the Home Secretary has a duty to deport any non-European foreign national sentenced to 12 months or more in prison.

The teenager's family said her killer's parents had shown no compassion throughout her murder trial

Emily was in her boyfriend's bedroom when he throttled her to death. Eventually police were called to the scene, where his parents told officers she died in her sleep or may have choked on a tight necklace

The 53-year-old is likely to claim the right to a family life under the European Convention of Human Rights in a bid to stay in the country. 

Mark and Caroline Longley said they were made to feel as though it was their fault their daughter had been killed

Her hearing will take place next month. 

Today Mark Longley said that his daughter's killer's family had shown no compassion towards them since the teenager was murdered. 

'It’s just another added consequence of what her son did. If he hadn’t murdered Emily all the subsequent things wouldn’t have happened either.

'If she gets deported, well they brought it on themselves really.

'They perverted the course of justice so she’s suffering the consequences now.

'They were the ones whose house Emily died in so I expected some compassion at the trial but there was nothing from them.

'Anita Turner made us feel like it was our fault her son killed our daughter, so I don’t have any compassion for her at all.'

British-born Emily moved to New Zealand with her family when she was nine. The aspiring model returned to the UK as a teenager to study, which is when she met Turner. 

Throughout her murder trial it was claimed the jeweller's son was a 'mummy's boy' who sometimes carried as much as £1,000 in cash. 

It was suggested he had threatened Emily before her death, and CCTV footage purporting to show him banging her head on a table in a nightclub emerged.
