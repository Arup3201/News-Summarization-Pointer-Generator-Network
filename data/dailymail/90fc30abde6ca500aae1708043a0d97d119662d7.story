For most people, playing racing video games is as close as they will get to being a racing driver.

But for Jann Mardenborough, this wasn't enough.

The 19-year-old from Cardiff was one of thousands of wannabe racers who took part in a unique competition on the Gran Turismo 5 video game that can transform gamers into professional race drivers.

Welcome to the GT Academy. Let the fastest time win.

Dream come true: Jann is still shocked at just how much has happened over the past 12 months

'I entered GT Academy as the prize at stake was incredible,' said Jann. 'It was always a dream to become a racing driver, but I never thought it would be possible as motorsport can be so expensive.

'I knew thousands of people would be entering, so I did not think at the start I would win. I knew it was too good an opportunity to pass up, so I thought it was worth giving it my best shot.'

Then began Jann's gruelling regime, every day trying to shave off milliseconds from his time in the hope of making the National Final. Having dropped out of university to reassess his career options, he had time on his side but as he soon found out, this made things no easier.

'I basically locked myself in my room for two weeks,' he said. 'I would have breakfast, and then I would focus everything on the time trial. After a quick break for lunch, I would be straight back on it to around four o’clock.

'It was tough, but I really wanted to make the National Final. There were times when my parents were on at me for spending so much time playing the game and some of my friends were travelling around Australia during a gap year, but I knew what I want to do. Become a professional racing driver!'

Little by little, Jann would see his lap times improve, only for another equally keen gamer to better him. Religiously checking the leader boards, Jann carried on undeterred until finally, nearly 1000 time trials later, his persistence paid off.

Doing it for real: Jann says the skills learned through playing the game served him well on the track

'I was thrilled, as just to qualify for the online time trials I must have done nearly 1,000 laps!' he said. 'When I did my best lap I was exiting the final corner with one hand on the steering wheel and the other fist-pumping the air because I knew that was the lap where I couldn’t go any faster, that was my limit.

'Then I watched the timing screens for the rest of the night and woke up in the morning to find out that I’d qualified and it was amazing. I was jumping for joy and telling my family, who were as excited as me. It was a fantastic moment.'

From then on, Jann's life changed. He went on to win the National Final and earn a place on the GT Academy Race Camp. Gone was the Playstation controller and safety of his bedroom. These were real cars with real, potentially fatal, consequences. Thankfully, Jann was able to transfer some of his gaming skills on to the track.

'I first drove the Nissan GT4 at GT Academy Race Camp, on slick tyres,' he said. 'The noise was just incredible, the gearbox was amazing and the brakes were so stiff – it was a car!

'I was definitely able to take some skills from the game into real life. I’d never had a car sideways before and I was suddenly doing it in real life, just from doing it on the game!'

Before long, Jann was racing in Le Mans 24 hours - a legendary endurance race that would push his skills to the limit. And even though he didn't make the podium, the entire experience was a moment Jann would treasure for a lifetime.

On course for success: The teenager has been tipped for great things in the racing world

'To be able to race at Le Mans last month racing against drivers I watched on TV was an incredible feeling!' he said.

'The Mulsanne Straight, the Porsche Curves…it was all as good as everyone said it would be.  Racing at Le Mans was everything I expected and more. When you are on the track, on your own, with new tyres and low-ish fuel, it’s incredible.'

As the latest crop of GT Academy drivers from the Gran Turismo 6 demo converge for the final at Silverstone on August 13 - only one thing will be on their minds: 'I wonder where I'll be this time next year...'
