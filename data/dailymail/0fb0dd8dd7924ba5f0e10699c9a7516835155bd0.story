One man claims that the legend of Bigfoot is 100 per cent real - and has released a photograph of a hairy humanoid body that he says proves the mythical creature's existence.

Of course, the man is also known to enjoy the occasional hoax.

Rick Dyer says he shot Bigfoot near San Antonio, Texas, on September 6, 2012. He also claims to have conducted 'scientific DNA tests' on the body and, after showing it off to more than 100 witnesses, now plans to take it on a tour around America.

Body of the beast: Rick Dyer claims that this is a photo of legendary creature Bigfoot, which he shot near San Antonio and now plans to take on tour

KSAT.com reports that this is the first time Mr Dyer has released a photo since he shared a grainy video of the beast lurking outside his tent.

Mr Dyer claims that he lured the beast by nailing pork ribs he had bought from Walmart to a tree.

He told KSAT: 'I nailed... pork ribs from the Walmart down the street to the side of the tree, and lo and behold, he came and started eating the pork ribs off the tree.'

The Huffington Post reports that Mr Dyer filmed the creature as he was enjoying his last meal. Obviously believing that the video evidence was not enough, Mr Dyer allegedly shot the creature.

The excitement surrounding Mr Dyer's claims is tempered somewhat by the fact that he was involved in a Bigfoot hoax back in 2008. Back then, as now, he claimed he had the body of Bigfoot. But The National Geographic reported that, once the frozen body began to thaw, the body turned out to be nothing more than a rubber ape suit.

This time Mr Dyer is adamant that his Bigfoot is 'for real'.

He said: 'From DNA tests to 3D optical scans to body scans. It is the real deal. It's Bigfoot and Bigfoot's here, and I shot it and now I'm proving it to the world.'

Mr Dyer has yet to produce the results of the DNA tests and optical scans, but he says he will be holding a press conference soon to answer any questions.

Bigfoot sightings have been reported in forested areas all over the world, but physical evidence - such as a partial or complete body of the creature - has so far proven elusive.Â
