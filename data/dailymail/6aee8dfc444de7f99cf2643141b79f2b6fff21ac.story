Chrissy Lee Smith, 35, was found guilty of sexual assault against a 15-year-old boy

A jury has found a former Lancaster County teacher guilty of having sex with a 15-year-old student in 2008.

It took less than an hour for the jury to return with the verdict Wednesday against 35-year-old Christy Smith.

The jury convicted her of four counts including sexual assault, corruption of a minor and involuntary deviant sexual assault. She faces up to 10 years in prison.

Smith testified that she and the student kissed but they didn't have sex.

The former unmarried McCaskey High School teacher had her 2012 conviction overturned when a state court ruled that she should have faced separate trials on allegations that she preyed on two boys, then aged 15 and 17. She is still awaiting trial on the other charges.

Back in 2012 Smith was convicted on 18 counts of having sex with two male students.

Both students testified at her trial at Lancaster County Court and both students gave similar accounts of their sexual relationship with the teacher.

The two victims were able to give specific details about Smith's apartment where the sex acts took place and about Smith herself.

The sex acts occurred at Smith's home at at 717 College Ave in Lancaster, Philadelphia

The 15 year old student, now in his early twenties, met Smith while he was a Sophomore at McCasky High School and claims that she initiated a sexual relationship with him.

The 17 year old victim, now in his mid to early twenties, was a senior at nearby Solanco High School and met Smith at a local dance class.

Smith was also found guilty of eight felony counts of child pornogrphy for having photos the students exchanged via their cell phones.

Investigators told Pennlive.com that Smith's sexual relationship with the 15-year-old ended when the school district began investigating accusations that she was molesting the victim. Smith was allegedly having sex with the other teenager when she was arrested.

In her 2012 conviction, prosecutors argued that her crimes we 'a pattern of behavior' and that she opened up about her personal life to relate to her younger students and then prey on them sexually, reports Lancaster Online.

She was an English teacher at McCaskey High School in Lancaster, Philadelphia
