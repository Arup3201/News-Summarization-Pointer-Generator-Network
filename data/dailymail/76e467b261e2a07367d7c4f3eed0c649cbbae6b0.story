A student pilot who lost half a wing in a potentially disastrous mid-air collision with his instructor managed to land his fighter jet safely.

The unnamed airman brought his F-16C back to base after losing five feet from the plane's right wing above Kansas during a mock dogfight.

He smashed into his instructor after losing sight of him during the practice encounter - sending the second fighter jet plummeting to earth.

While the plane was obliterated when it hit the ground, its pilot managed to eject in time and was not badly hurt.

Meanwhile the student managed to bring his damaged vehicle 100 miles south to an air base in Tulsa, Oklahoma, and made a safe landing.

Images of the collision were released this week as part of an Air Force investigation into the crash.

According to the Washington Post, investigators determined that a missile on the right wing tip of the student's plane tore through the right wing of his instructor's plane, close to the fuselage.

Damaged: Air Force investigators estimated that the accident cost $22.5million

It then also hit the plane's right-hand tail fin, sending the plane hurtling to earth. The student shouted repeatedly over the radio for the instructor to bail out, which he did, landing just 60ft from the wreckage of the plane.

The collision came after both student and instructor misinterpreted the other's maneuvers and turned towards one another at an altitude of 7,500ft.

The two planes were supposed to be coordinating to hunt down a third plane in the training flight.

They successfully staged one engagement, but disaster struck during a second run.

Air Force investigators estimated that the collision, which totalled one F-16, cost $22.5million.
