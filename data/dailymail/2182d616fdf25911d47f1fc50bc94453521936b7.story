Wealthy background: The state is footing the bill for Vincent Tabak's team of lawyers even though he earned a £45,000 salary as a consultant engineer

Joanna Yeates’s parents spoke of their anger last night as it emerged that the legal bill for their daughter’s killer could cost taxpayers hundreds of thousands of pounds.

Dutchman Vincent Tabak, 34, is serving a life sentence for strangling the 25-year-old landscape architect at her home before dumping her body nearby.

The taxpayer has already paid £6,000 towards the bill for the leading barrister and a team of lawyers who represented Tabak, despite the fact that he earned about £45,000 a year as a consultant engineer.

But legal experts say the final bill for the public purse could run into hundreds of thousands. Even though Tabak could be ordered to pay some of his costs, it is unlikely he could afford the entire amount.

Yesterday Miss Yeates’s parents said they were ‘outraged’ by the revelation.

‘It’s ridiculous he should get that level of legal aid,’ her father David, 63, said yesterday. ‘He comes from a wealthy background and he showed contempt to the court, to us, to his girlfriend and her family.

‘He should never have received taxpayers’ money to defend himself.’

Mr Yeates added that Tabak could have saved the family additional heartache, as well as reducing the costs of his trial, by admitting murder earlier on.

‘He prolonged the case by lying to the police and lying during his trial,’ he said. ‘To this day, he has never acknowledged outside court that he killed Jo. We feel he should now be held to account in every way possible.’

Even Tabak’s own barrister admitted to the court during the trial that his client’s behaviour while he tried to cover his tracks had been ‘disgusting’.

In the days after killing Miss Yeates at her Bristol home in December 2010, Tabak put his victim’s family through a ‘week of hell’ by insisting he knew nothing about her disappearance.

This meant her body was not found for several days after she was reported missing.

Tabak, a neighbour of Miss Yeates,  also told police a pack of lies and even  pointed the finger at his innocent landlord, Chris Jefferies.

Tabak then forced Miss Yeates’s  family through the further agony of a  six-week murder trial by admitting only to manslaughter.

He told the court that he had panicked and placed his hand over her mouth after she screamed when he tried to kiss her.

Her parents said watching Tabak’s ‘lies’ and ‘words of self pity’ in the witness box had been ‘more stressful and intense than they ever imagined’.

At one point, Miss Yeates’s mother, Teresa, broke down in tears as the court was shown a picture of her daughter lying in a mortuary.

At the trial, the Dutchman was defended by one of the country’s top barristers, William Clegg, QC.

He also had a defence team of between four and six led by a highly paid partner in the Somerset law firm Kelcey and Hall Solicitors, whose legal bill is yet to be settled.

Legal aid authorities confirmed yesterday that they had received a bill from Kelcey and Hall for work for Tabak’s trial.

Although the bill had not been settled, one legal source said: ‘You are looking at an enormous bill. It will be a considerable sum of money.’

Tabak strangled Miss Yeates just minutes after she arrived home alone following Christmas drinks with friends in December 2010.

He drove her battered body to a secluded lane and dumped it by the roadside, where it was found on Christmas morning by a couple walking their dog.

A consultant engineer, Tabak earned 
around £45,000 a year as a ‘people-flow analyst’ for the global 
engineering consultancy Buro Happold, where he had worked since moving 
to England in 2007.

The pilot’s son, who is from an affluent Dutch family, had also been saving to buy a flat with his girlfriend Tanja Morson.

Despite Tabak’s apparently comfortable finances, the Legal Services Commission has already paid Crossmans Solicitors in Somerset £2,986 for his legal advice when he was arrested, and £3,358.98 for work carried out at crown court, including £2,523 for ‘disbursements’ and £835 for ‘litigation’.

A Legal Services Commission spokesperson said the full amount of Tabak’s legal aid would eventually be made public.

He said: 'Anyone facing a crown court trial can apply for legal aid. This ensures these often complex trials are heard thoroughly and fairly.

'Defendants can be made to pay a substantial monthly contribution. This is due to a means testing scheme. If convicted in the crown court, anyone with over £30,000 capital assets can be made to pay an additional contribution.'
