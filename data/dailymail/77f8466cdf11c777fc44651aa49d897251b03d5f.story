Doctors are always telling us to eat more fruit to make sure we stay healthy.

But what they didn't see coming is the fruit sprouting on these trees in Old Spitalfields Market, London.

That's because, despite appearances, these juicy looking oranges and lemons are actually made of chocolate.

Forbidden fruit: unfortunately for those looking for a tasty way to stay healthy, these chocolate treats will not count as one of your five a day

Bounty of the land: The three fruit trees have sprouted in London's Old Spitafields Market and will be offering free tastings from 10am until 6pm tomorrow

The ingenious edible grove appeared this morning to help launch Green & Black's new range of organic orange and lemon chocolate.

The funky fruit was created in partnership with Jacqui Kelly for Miss Cakehead and took 55 hours and 65 kilograms of chocolate to make.

Visitors to the market are being invited to try free samples from the three chocolate trees from 10am until 6pm.

New: The stunt has been put on ahead of the launch of Green and Black's new organic lemon and orange chocolate bars in October

Confusion: The mixed-up trees surprised commuters this morning as they seemed to have grown overnight

The two new 100g bars will be available from October. The orange flavour will be mixed with milk chocolate, and the lemon will be dark chocolate.

Miss Cakehead is the creative head of Eat Your Heart Out, a collection of food artists who specialise in attention-grabbing pop-up projects involving unusual food.

The team were behind the macabre 2012 stunt which saw a butcher's shop claiming to sell human body parts appear in Smithfield Market, also in London, to coincide with the release of zombie shooter game Resident Evil 6.

Disturbing: the same group of food artists also pulled off this rather more unnerving stunt making human body parts from animal meat
