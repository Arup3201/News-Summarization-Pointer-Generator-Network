An elderly couple have been found dead inside their home with a note and a gun by their bodies in an apparent 'murder suicide.'

The bodies of James Ryals, 73, and his wife, Joyce Ryals, 74 were discovered at their Ormond 
Beach home, Florida, last night after a relative in New Jersey raised the alarm when she could not contact them.

Police believe Mr Ryals shot his wife before killing himself and police said they had a difficult relationship, although it is not know what the motive was.

Their bodies were found in the 
bathroom of the building by officers from Volusia County sheriff's department.

The couple's deaths are being investigated as a 'murder-suicide,' Gary Davidson, a Volusia County Sheriff's Office spokesman told the 
Orlando Sentinel.

Though the note found by officers did not say anything about the double killing, Mr Davidson revealed there were some marital problems between the couple.

He said, however, that there was no clear motive for why Mr Ryal would have killed his 74-year-old wife and then shot himself.

'We don't know for sure why this happened and we may never know,' Mr Davidson said.

Investigators did not initially identify the couple because their relatives live in the area of the US that has been devastated by Hurricane Sandy.

The Volusia County Medical Examiner's Office was scheduled to begin autopsies on the dead couple today, Mr Davidson said.

Officers visited the Ryals' home in Woodhaven Circle just before midnight last night after a family member of the couple called from New Jersey expressing concern that they could not be contacted.

Their deaths are believed to have taken place between Monday and Tuesday night.

Deputies had visited the Ryals home in August last year after being called to a disturbance, according to the Daytona Beach News Journal.

In that incident, Mr Ryals told the officers that he and his wife, had argued and she had thrown a slipper at him and he threw it back at her.

Mr Ryals said his wife told him 'he was worthless because he only has one leg' and 'never lets her do what she wants,' according to the Journal.

The Ryals' reportedly told deputies at the time that their marriage had been 'very hard,' and that they were always arguing with each other.
