Malala Yousafzai, who won the
Nobel Peace Prize on Friday, is hailed around the world as a
champion of women's rights who stood up bravely against the
Taliban to defend her beliefs.

But in her deeply conservative homeland, many view her with
suspicion as an outcast or even as a Western creation aimed at
damaging Pakistan's image abroad.

Malala, now aged 17, became globally known in 2012 when
Taliban gunmen almost killed her for her passionate advocacy of
women's right to education.

She has since become a symbol of defiance in the fight
against militants operating in Pashtun tribal areas in northwest
Pakistan - a region where women are expected to keep their
opinions to themselves and stay at home.

'The terrorists thought that they would change our aims and
stop our ambitions but nothing changed in my life except this:
Weakness, fear and hopelessness died. Strength, power and
courage was born,' she told the United Nations last year.

'I do not even hate the Talib who shot me. Even if there is
a gun in my hand and he stands in front of me. I would not shoot
him,' she said in a speech which captivated the world.

Malala has also won the European Union's human rights award
and was one of the favourites to win the Nobel Prize last year.

Now based in Britain, she is unable to return to her
homeland because of Taliban threats to kill her and her family
members. The current Taliban chief, Mullah Fazlullah, was the
one who ordered the 2012 attack against her.

Yousafzai has enrolled in a school in Birmingham and become
a global campaigner for women's right to education and other
human rights issues, taking up issues such as the situation in
Syria and Nigieria.

In her native Swat valley, however, many people view Malala
- backed by a supportive family and a doting father who inspired
her to keep up with her campaign - with a mixture of suspicion,
fear and jealousy.

At the time of her Nobel nomination last year, social media
sites were brimming with insulting messages. 'We hate Malala
Yousafzai, a CIA agent,' said one Facebook page.

She was a young student in the Swati town of Mingora in
Pakistan's northwestern Khyber Pakhtunkhwa province when she
became interested in women's rights.

At the time, the Taliban were in power in the strategic
valley after they took control over the region and imposed
strict Islamic rules, including their opposition to women's
education.

She wrote an anonymous blog describing her life under the
Taliban controlled the region. In October 2012, after the
Taliban were pushed out of Swat by the Pakistani army, she was
shot in the head on her way to school by a Taliban gunman.

She survived after being airlifted to Britain for treatment
and recovered from her life-threatening wounds.

'The wise saying, 'The pen is mightier than sword' was true.
The extremists are afraid of books and pens,' she told the
United Nations. 'The power of education frightens them. They are
afraid of women. The power of the voice of women frightens
them.'
