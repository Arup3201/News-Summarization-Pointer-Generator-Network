A 16-year-old girl who was raped and then had pictures of her naked body posted to social media has publicly stepped forward as she seeks charges against her attacker

While most news outlets do not publish the identities of sexual assault victims, the Houston teen identified as Jada chose to forgo her privacy by giving a televised interview with news station KHOU.

Jada believes she was drugged at a recent party, and only later found out that she was raped when her attacker started sharing pictures and video of the assault online.

Shared: Jada, a 16-year-old from Houston, Texas, claims she was drugged and raped at a high school party, and that pictures of her assault were then posted online

'There's no point in hiding. Everybody has already seen my face and my body, but that's not what I am and who I am,' Jada told KHOU.

Jada told the station that she attended the party with a friend, and thought it was just going to be kids hanging out.

But when she showed up, the teen boy hosting the party gave her a drink of punch she believes was spiked with some sort of drug.

Jada says she passed out and didn't know what happened for the rest of the night until after the party, when pictures of her body - stripped from the waist down - started appearing on social media.

Since then, some of Jada's peers have mercilessly continued to spread the videos and pictures online, while others have reached out to her for support.

Houston Police say they are now investigating Jada's claims.

Jada says she hopes an arrest comes soon. She adds that she's angry, and wants to be home-schooled come fall.

Her mother, who chose not to be identified, said: 'No one's daughter deserved this. No human being deserved this.'
