Accused racist: Prosecutors argue that Brian Keith Jones, 25, killed Brian Lomax in December 2012 because Lomax was a black man

A 25-year-old with a swastika and 'White Power' tattooed on his body claims he shot dead a black man in December 2012 out of self-defense.

Brian Keith Jones made his first court appearance in Sacramento on Wednesday as he faces murder charges in the death of 36-year-old Duane Lomax.

The three-time felon fatally shot Jones after getting a call from his sister who said a 'n*****' was following her and a friend in a car.

While Jones cried on the witness stand Wednesday and said he was no longer affiliated with a prison white supremacist gang, prosecutors argue that he shot Lomax out of racism.

'You’re trying to make this a racial thing,' Jones shot back at one point, using his wife's black father and a friend in the court room as evidence he isn't prejudiced.

Sister Karrina Slabbekorn and friend Vanessa Reyes-Singh spent the night before the shooting out clubbing and had a run-in with Lomax at a Wendy's in the early hours of December 8.

Lomax thought he saw Reyes-Singh point a gun at him, so he called 911 while he tailed the girls into a Sacramento neighborhood.

Lomax, who was only in town to attend his son's birthday party, was about to leave the unfamiliar neighborhood when a car swerved in front of him, blocking his way.

While he was talking to a 911 operator, Slabbekorn had called her brother who lived with another sister in nearby.

Jones says his sister sounded 'hysterical' and 'panicked' by the 'n*****' following them, so he grabbed his revolver and drove off to confront Lomax.

On the line: Lomax was on the phone with 911 operators the whole time, tailing the two girls because he thought they brandished a weapon at him. Jones shot at hist six times

Jones first passed his sister's friend on the road, and let her drive past. But then he quickly turned and blocked Lomax and got out of the car.

Just before his line with the 911 operator went dead, Lomax said: 'Oh, now we got somebody else.I guess they called somebody else, to – oh, hey, how – ho, ho, ho. This guy has a gun and he’s shooting at me.'

It's still unclear what actually occurred in those moments after the call dropped.

Jones says he got out of the car and feared Lomax was going to run over him so he fired a single shot.

'At that time, I was fearing for my life and my sister's you know,' Jones told KCRA from jail in December 2012. 'So, when I jumped back, I opened fire on the vehicle.'

From there, he ran to the side of the vehicle but tripped and says Jones began to back up again.

Again, Jones claims he feared he was going to be run over so he fired five more shots into the side of the car.

One of he bullets hit Lomax's neck, killing the man who ran an x-ray cleaning business with his family in Atlanta.

Jones called the shooting 'an accident' and 'a mistake' to KCRA. 

Not planned: When interviewed by KCRA reporters in December 2012, Jones said the shooting was a 'mistake' and an 'accident'

After Lomax's line went dead, the 911 operator dispatched police to the area but by the time they arrived it was too late.

In court on Wednesday, prosecutors say Jones was motivated to kill Lomax because the man was black, pointing to the 'White Power', 'Pure Hate' and swastika tattoos he has on his body.

But Jones says he was just 15 and 16 when he got the permanent marks, and they no longer reflect how he actually feels.

'I made some bad decisions as a kid, and I’ve regretted it ever since,' he said.

In court, he wore a green dress shirt buttoned all the way to the top to conceal one of his offensive neck tattoos

If convicted, this will be the third time Lomax has entered state prison.

His most recent conviction was in 2011 for being an ex-felon with a firearm.

He's facing those charges again now since he was illegally possessing a pistol when he shot Lomax.

When asked by a KCRA reporter in December 2012 how he got the weapon, Jones said: 'that don't matter'. 

Reporters also showed up to Jones' mother after his initial arrest. While she wouldn't talk much about her 25-year-old son, she did vouch for him.

'He's not the kind of person they say he is,' she said.

When confronted by reporters, all Jones' mother said was 'He's not the kind of person they say he is'
