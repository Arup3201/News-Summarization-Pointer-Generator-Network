Claudio Ranieri has received a four million euro pay-off from Monaco following his sacking in May.

The 62-year-old Italian was dismissed at the end of last season, despite leading them to second in Ligue 1 and securing a Champions League spot.

Ranieri joined the principality club in May 2012 and secured promotion to the top flight at the first time of asking, but leaves after failing to beat Paris St Germain to the French championship.

Les Rouges et Blancs finished nine points behind PSG and eight above third-placed Lille on their return to Ligue 1.

'It was a difficult decision,' Monaco vice-president Vasim Vasilyev told a press conference at the time. 'It's never easy when the results are good.'

'But we believe that at this stage of the project we need to find a new dynamic.'

Former Sporting Lisbon boss Leonardo Jardim has taken over at the club, and he has at his disposal an impressive squad featuring the likes of João Moutinho, Radamel Falcao, Dimitar Berbatov and World Cup superstar James Rodriguez.

Rome-born Ranieri - who can also number Parma, Juventus, Valencia and Inter Milan among his former clubs - is reportedly in line to become the new manager of the Greece national team.
