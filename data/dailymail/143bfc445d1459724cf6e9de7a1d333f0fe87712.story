The Little Couple's Jen Arnold has spoken frankly of little Zoey's integration into her new family, in an exclusive sneak preview of tonight's episode on TLC.

'Life has definitely changed a lot since bringing Zoey home from India,' the 39-year-old mother of two revealed, speaking touchingly about the toddler's transformation from 'a very frightened little girl' to a 'bright eyed, happy so well-adjusted two-year-old.'

In the clip, the family are shown in high spirits enjoying a dinner together; a happy scene which is a far cry from many of the show's recent episodes.

'Will and Zoey, like many kids who come from orphanages, are somewhat fixated on food,' Mrs Arnold explains in the preview. 'We feel often times like it is a race to get food on the table!'

At one point, the two children are encouraged to pray before starting their meal. Will clasps his little hands together in a willing gesture while Zoey waves her fork around animatedly.

Despite the all-round smiles, it hasn't been an easy ride for the family of late. The neonatologist and reality TV star mother - who, with her husband Bill Klein, as well as both children, has a type of dwarfism called skeletal dysplasia - was diagnosed with choriocarcinoma last year, a rare form of uterine cancer.

She revealed on a previous episode that transitioning Zoey into the family whilst undergoing six rounds of chemotherapy was extremely difficult. 'In my darkest moments, I couldn't get out of bed,' she confessed.

The couple welcomed Zoey into their home in Houston, Texas last year, and the toddler - who was raised from infancy in an orphanage - had a difficult time adjusting to life in America.

According to the couple, for weeks, Zoey would have temper tantrums where she would throw herself on the ground and cry uncontrollably.

Happily, the feisty child appears to be in much better spirits in the preview for tonight's show.

In another clip, obtained by People Magazine, Mrs Arnold is shown happily playing a game of make believe with her two children.

Using a toy medical kit, the three take part in the 'fun weekend activity', which Mrs Arnold explains is to help little Zoey prepare for a check-up at the doctors the following day.

In the clip from the upcoming episode, she also speaks of how Will, 3, who she adopted from China, also last year, is dealing with his mother's slow recovery from cancer, describing the toddler as 'sensitive' and 'smart'.

'Will doesn't miss a beat and I guess the fact that he now understands mommy's sick, it's touching,' she said.

Mrs Arnold received her devastating cancer verdict soon after the couple won their year-and-a-half battle to adopt young Zoey from India, and although the news broke last year, her reaction to the news was first shown on the latest episode of the show.

United front: In spite of all their struggles, the strong couple say they are 'blown away' by their daughter's progress

Mrs Arnold described the ‘rapidly growing’ tumor in her uterus as having metastasized into ‘three nodules’ in her lungs.

Determined not to let her diagnosis interfere with the adoption of her daughter, eleven months old at the time, she said: ‘That’s what’s getting me through this cancer diagnosis is getting Zoey home and acclimated and continuing to watch Will grow.’

Thankfully, Zoey is now responding positively; these days, the little one 'loves to give kisses' and play with her older brother, who affectionately calls her 'Oh Zoey'.

Despite the rough start, her proud parents couldn't be happier. 'We're blown away by the progress she's made,' said Mrs Arnold.
