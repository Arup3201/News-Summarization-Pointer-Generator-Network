In his final words to the ones he loved, James Foley thanked his family for getting him through his almost two year hostage ordeal, saying the memories of home 'takes me away and happiness fills my heart'.

The 40-year-old journalist, who was beheaded by Islamic State (IS) militants, was not allowed to send letters from his hostage cell in Syria, but asked a fellow hostage who was due to be released to commit a letter to memory.

Danish photojournalist Daniel Rye Ottosen, 25, spent 13 months imprisoned alongside Foley and, when released in June, released in June, his first call was to Foley’s mum Diane, when he dictated the lengthy letter to her.

Diane and her husband John Foley have now released the letter in full on a Facebook page set up in their late son's honor.

The letter was posted following a memorial for Foley in his hometown of Rochester, New Hampshire, on Sunday.

'I know you are thinking of me and praying for me. And I am so thankful,' Foley said.

'I feel you all especially when I pray. I pray for you to stay strong and to believe. I really feel I can touch you even in this darkness when I pray.'

Foley described the conditions of his cell in the letter, saying he was held in a cell with 18 others, Sky News reported.

They passed the time talking about movies, sport and trivia, and managed to find ways of playing chess, checkers and Risk.

'They have been a huge help. We repeat stories and laugh to break the tension,' he said.

'I have had weak and strong days.

'We are so grateful when anyone is freed; but of course, yearn for our own freedom.

'We try to encourage each other and share strength.'

The letter, which includes messages for different family members, ends with Mr Foley addressing his grandmother.

'Grammy, please take your medicine, take walks and keep dancing. I plan to take you out to Margarita's when I get home,' he said.

'Stay strong because I am going to need your help to reclaim my life.'

Foley's mother flew to Copenhagen the week before her son was executed to meet with Ottosen, according to the boss of the Boston-based online news organization Foley was working for when he was snatched in November 2012.

Phil Balboni, CEO of GlobalPost, told how Diane developed a ‘close bond’ with the families of other hostages still in captivity and met up with released hostages from France and Spain who had been held by the same group of British jihadis dubbed The Beatles.

‘She went to Copenhagen to meet with the Danish journalist who memorized the letter. He provided new details of his time with Jim. All of the released hostages spoke of Jim’s courage. He was subjected to the most abuse and torture because he was American but they never broke his spirit.

‘Diane has become extremely close to the families of other Western hostages who are still in captivity. They share a special and very close bond.’

Balboni described Diane as ‘a woman on a mission’ to save her son from the moment the first email arrived from his captors on November 26, 2013.

‘The email was sent to me and to Jim’s brother Michael. It was brief. It said “We’re holding James. We’re prepared to negotiate for his release. We need money – FAST.”

‘They had all of Jim’s cellphone contacts which is how they got our email addresses.

‘There were more emails, five or six in all. They gave us the opportunity to ask proof-of-life questions, obscure family references impossible for anyone but Jim to answer. That was in early December, 2013. We felt great hope.’

In one email, the terrorists made their sole demand – for $135 million and the release of Muslim prisoners held by the US.

But then the terrorists stopped communicating.

After months
 of silence, the Foleys received a final email, dated August 12 – a 
hate-filled rant full of rudimentary spelling errors in which the 
jihadis vowed to execute Foley saying ‘You (America) and your citizens 
will pay the price of your bombings!

‘The
 first of which being the blood of the American citizen James Foley! He 
will be executed as a DIRECT result of your transgressions towards us!’

The email may have been written by ‘John’, the British jihadi who beheaded Foley, reports claim.

A
 memorial service for James Foley will took place Saturday at the family’s 
church, Holy Rosary.

Dear Family and Friends,

I remember going to the Mall with Dad, a very long bike ride with Mom. I remember so many great family times that take me away from this prison. Dreams of family and friends take me away and happiness fills my heart.

I know you are thinking of me and praying for me. And I am so thankful. I feel you all especially when I pray. I pray for you to stay strong and to believe. I really feel I can touch you even in this darkness when I pray.

Eighteen of us have been held together in one cell, which has helped me. We have had each other to have endless long conversations about movies, trivia, sports. We have played games made up of scraps found in our cell…we have found ways to play checkers, Chess, and Risk… and have had tournaments of competition, spending some days preparing strategies for the next day’s game or lecture. The games and teaching each other have helped the time pass. They have been a huge help. We repeat stories and laugh to break the tension.

I have had weak and strong days. We are so grateful when anyone is freed; but of course, yearn for our own freedom. We try to encourage each other and share strength. We are being fed better now and daily. We have tea, occasional coffee. I have regained most of my weight lost last year.

I think a lot about my brothers and sister. I remember playing Werewolf in the dark with Michael and so many other adventures. I think of chasing Mattie and T around the kitchen counter. It makes me happy to think of them. If there is any money left in my bank account, I want it to go to Michael and Matthew. I am so proud of you, Michael and thankful to you for happy childhood memories and to you and Kristie for happy adult ones.

And big John, how I enjoyed visiting you and Cress in Germany. Thank you for welcoming me. I think a lot about RoRo and try to imagine what Jack is like. I hope he has RoRo’s personality!

And Mark… so proud of you too Bro. I think of you on the West coast and hope you are doing some snowboarding and camping, I especially remember us going to the Comedy Club in Boston together and our big hug after. The special moments keep me hopeful.

Katie, so very proud of you. You are the strongest and best of us all!! I think of you working so hard, helping people as a nurse. I am so glad we texted just before I was captured. I pray I can come to your wedding…. now I am sounding like Grammy!!

Grammy, please take your medicine, take walks and keep dancing. I plan to take you out to Margarita’s when I get home. Stay strong because I am going to need your help to reclaim my life.

Jim
