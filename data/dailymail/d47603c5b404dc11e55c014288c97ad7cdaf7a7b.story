A Canadian hiker has released a video of what he thinks could be Sasquatch in the mountains near Squamish, British Columbia.

The video was shot by Myles Lamont two years ago while he was hiking in the Tantalus Range, north of Vancouver.

Now that it has been posted on YouTube, more than 260,000 people have viewed the footage.

Standing out: The video shows a black dot of a figure apparently moving up the slope of a snow covered mountain

Is this the beast? A Canadian man who claims he filmed a possible sasquatch while hiking in the Tantalus Range near Squamish, B.C. two years ago is getting thousands of hits on YouTube after recently uploading the footage

A memorable trip: Mr Lamont was hiking with some friends in the Tantalus Range, British Columbia, north of Vancouver two years ago when he encountered the mysterious creature

Mr Lamont claims he only uploaded the video for the benefit of a couple of friends.

'We had no intention for it to gather the interest it has. We are not claiming this to be anything other than a strange encounter.'

The video shows a small black dot of a figure reportedly moving up a mountain.

'Pretty sure this is Sasquatch down there,' said Mr Lamont on the video recording. 'I can't see it very well. It's this little black dot walking in the middle of the snow in the middle of nowhere.'

Mr Lamont says he was able to view the
 subject far better than what the video portrays as it was just a simple
 point and shoot camera. 'The contrast was excellent due to the snow 
behind the subject,' he says.

The video is intriguing because the shape does appear to be rapidly moving up the mountain.

Can you spot bigfoot? Myles Lamont of Vancouver, Canada, shot this footage in the summer of 2011, but is just uploading it now, and it's garnered almost 260,000 views

Rapid ramble: Less than a minute later, the creature still seems to be moving with incredible pace against a snowy mountain-face

'If that's human why would you walk up that ridge or that snow line?' Mr Lamont asks. 'Why would he not just go straight down?'

'Good thing we brought beers,' he jokes. 'Maybe we can lure him over here. I don't know how high we are, but we're probably close to 7,000 feet and this guy's just scampering up snow lines like it's no big deal.'

He states in his posting that 'the 
subject was clearly bipedal and was without snowshoes or a backpack and 
wearing all one colored clothing'.

'Movement
 over this kind of terrain in soft snow without snowshoes would have 
been very difficult and the distance travelled over the given time period
 would have been very fast for a human without proper snow travel gear.'

Fake? Almost all Bigfoot footage is ¿ grainy and shot from an incredible distance, but it does appear to depict a rather large individual moving at considerably-faster-than-human speed up a snowy slope

Speedy: Whoever or whatever it was covered an vast amount of ground in a very short space of time in the most difficult of conditions

Some other interesting factors are noticed about the unusual recording.

'There was a very steep drop off below where the video was shot, easily a 300m sheer face. We were not equipped with climbing gear and a descent around would have been impossible before nightfall,' Mr Lamont says.

He does not believe that the footage is that of a bear or any other wild animal.

'Perhaps the most reasonable explanation for this video is a very ill prepared hiker, hiking up a difficult section of snowline as opposed to a much easier route, one who is very physically fit and able to cover ground in unusually quick fashion and must have had very large feet as we were breaking through snow crust in just our boots.'

Although some may question the authenticity of Mr Lamonts' video, over the past five years, the Sasquatch Genome Project has spent $500,000 on collecting data and evidence and describe it as a 'serious study.'

The group says they'll continue to collect evidence and video, which will be used in a documentary at a later date.

For many, Bigfoot is considered to be a combination of folklore, misidentification and hoax.

Along with the Loch Ness Monster, it is commonly described as a modern-day myth - but that has not prevented a raft of sightings throughout the 20th and 21st centuries.

In 1951 American Eric Shipton photographed what he described as a Yeti footprint beginning a spate of 'sightings' and print finds.

More recently, the Sasquatch Genome Project spent $500,000 on collecting data and evidence over the past five years.

In the last 12 months alone there have been several reported sightings, although not all have gone uncontested.

In October last year an apparent Bigfoot sighting in Pennsylvania was labelled a scam after the mythical creature turned out to be a huge tree stump.

Hiker John Stoneman claimed he spotted not one but two of the seven-foot-tall ape-like beasts through the trees, just yards from a main road in Kinzua State Park near Bradford.

But a tipster told HuffPost Weird News either Stoneman was lying or he didn't know he was actually staring at a chunk of a tree that had been uprooted by well drillers.

In the same month it was reported researchers at the Sasquatch Genome Project screened what they claimed was conclusive evidence that the creature exists.

During a news conference in Texas, the group of experts played several short clips that they described as ‘never before seen HD video’ of the supposed ape-like creature.

The footage consisted of very short, grainy and out-of-focus clips of various apparently human-like, hairy figures moving about in wooded areas in Kentucky.

The announcement came just one week after a map was released which plotted out every reported Bigfoot sighting in North America for the last 92 years.

A map was released in September last year which plots out every reported Bigfoot sighting in North America for the last 92 years

PhD candidate Josh Stevens mapped out the 3,313 possible Sasquatch spots since 1921 and found that people do seem to glimpse the hairy creature much more in some regions than others.

The map and data collated by the Bigfoot Field Researchers Organization show, for example, that Bigfoot has supposedly been spotted three times more often in Missouri than neighboring Kansas.

Stevens explains on his website: 'Right away you can see that sightings are not evenly distributed. At first glance, it looks a lot like a map of population distribution.'

This makes sense - by a law of averages you would expect an area with more people to report more possible Sasquatch viewings.

Even so, there are some very bright spots around the Ohio River Valley, Mississippi River Valley, the Sierra Nevada mountains, central Florida and the Pacific Northwest.

Yet it gets intriguing when Stevens maps the relationship between reported sightings and population density.

As he notes: 'There are distinct regions where sightings are incredibly common, despite a very sparse population.

'On the other hand, in some of the most densely populated areas Sasquatch sightings are exceedingly rare.'

Most of these Bigfoot hot spots are in the Western United States.

Stevens acknowledges that 'terrain and habitat likely play a major role in the distribution of reports.'
