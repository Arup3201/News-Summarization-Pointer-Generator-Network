With his Soviet-style military hat and an assault rifle in his hand, Steve Hedley looks every inch the rightful successor to his firebrand friend, the late RMT boss, Bob Crow.

Mr Hedley, who as the union's assistant general secretary is one of five candidates declared so far for his late friend's position in charge of the Union of Rail, Maritime and Transport workers, pulls no punches about his far-left positioning.

His Facebook page is filled with status updates glorifying Tube strikes, with one post reading: 'It's taken me three hours to drive eight miles: mission accomplished, gridlock achieved, victory to the RMT.'

Gun-toting militant: RMT assistant general secretary, Steve Hedley, is a contender for the union leadership

Strike-happy: Transport chiefs fear London may face further, and worse, strikes if Mr Hedley gets his way

Another post exhorts his 2,000-plus friends not to cross the picket line in last week's Tube strike, saying: 'If you are on our side then respect our picket lines, if you are on the Government's side you will cross the pickets and be remembered as the 21st century UDM scabs and class traitors. 

'Support yourself by supporting the RMT strike.  DON'T CROSS PICKET LINES.'

And yet another post, which he later took down, read: 'With three different strikes announced today, I think I'll enjoy the Easter weekend.'

Further posts glorify striking RMT members, while another attacked 'Dave' [sic] Miliband, saying: 'Wake up and smell the coffee, the Labour Party is well and truly over.  Vote TUSC and build a workers' party.'

And in another post, later taken down, Mr Hedley, who is from East Ham, in east London, wrote: 'I've had to move down the carriage to escape a load of middle-class prats and their mockney accents.

'Posh people really shouldn't deliberately drop their H's in an attempt to pretend they are something they clearly are not.'

Don't you mean Ed?  Mr Hedley's Facebook page tells Labour that the party 'is well and truly over'

After the former Israeli leader Ariel Sharon died, Mr Hedley wrote: 'Thatcher will have company in hell tonight as another war criminal snuffs it'.

Meanwhile photographs on his Facebook page support the image of him as a hard-left politician.

One picture shows him and Mr Crow grinning at the camera, with Mr Hedley raising his clenched fist in the universal symbol of industrial workers, while another shows him smirking in front of the Kremlin,

Transport bosses are said to fear a strike-happy militant like Mr Hedley succeeding in his ambition to lead the RMT into a new era following the death of Mr Crow in March.

They believe if the radical unionist becomes the new general secretary of the RMT, it can only mean further disruption for the capital.

'DON'T CROSS PICKET LINES': The union member's Facebook page shows he is a keen supporter of strikes

Last week's 48-hour Tube strike, organised by the RMT, brought chaos to London as trains were cancelled and stations closed.

Union
 members were complaining about planned closures of ticket office, where
 fewer than three per cent of all Tube journeys begin.

A
 second, three-day strike had been planned for this week, but was called
 off at the last minute yesterday after last-ditch talks with the 
conciliation service Acas.

London
 Mayor Boris Johnson, who had damned last week's strike as 'pointless', 
described the cancelling of the strike, which was due to take hold 
today, as 'a victory for commonsense and for Londoners'.

Mr Hedley is one of five RMT members to have put their names forward for the job left vacant by Crow, who has been described as 'moderate by RMT standards'. 

The others are uncompromising hardliner, John Leach, senior acting general secretary, Mick Cash, former union president Alex Gordon, and the RMT's national organising coordinator, Alan Pottage.

Nominations close in July and the result will be announced in September.

Grant Shapps, Conservative party chairman said: 'The line-up of challengers for the job of RMT leader is alarming.

'Mick Cash, who is considered to be a 'moderate' when compared with the rest, held commuters to ransom and did untold damage to our economy last week on flimsy grounds.

'Or imagine a world with Stephen Hedley in charge - a man who revels in inconveniencing the British public.

'It's a disgrace, and it's high time Ed Miliband stood up to the union bosses who sponsor several of his own MPs.

Today Mr Hedley denied being a 'communist' or anti-middle class, and played down his comment about enjoying the Easter weekend after strikes were announced.

He told the Evening Standard: 'I meant nothing by that - I was just looking forward to the Easter weekend when I go to church.'

And referring to pictures of him wearing a Soviet-style hat and posing by the Kremlin, he said: 'I am no communist... I dressed up for a laugh.'

No-one from the RMT was available for comment.
