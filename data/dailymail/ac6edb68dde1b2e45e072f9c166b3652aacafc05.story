A soldier who was shot dead in Afghanistan has saved four lives with his donated organs.

Kingsman Dave Shaw, 23 of 1st Battalion The Duke of Lancaster's Regiment, became the 440th British soldier to die in Afghanistan since 2001 when he was shot by insurgents.

His parents David and Jenny made the decision to allow their son's organs to be donated, saving the lives of seriously ill patients at Queen Elizabeth Hospital in Birmingham.

Today they spoke of their love and pride of the 'mischievous but sensitive' young man.

Mr Shaw died two days after being shot in Helmand Province on January 14.

'He wanted to be in the army since about year two in school,' recalled Mrs Shaw, 50, from Barrow, Cumbria.

'Whenever they talked about what they wanted to be when they grew up he always said he was going to be a soldier.'

Mr Shaw's older sister Michelle, 29, and younger brother Charlie, 21, described their brother as having a 'crazy sense of humour'.

His mother added: 'He said to his senior officer during his training, "I suppose I better call you sir?". That was our Dave all over.'

Mr Shaw joined the army in 2008. His father David, 49, said: 'I was pleased he'd decided he was going to do something, because it gave him some direction in life.'

Fulfilling his dreams: Mr Shaw had always wanted to be a soldier, his parents said

Mental strength and determination saw Mr Shaw fulfil his dream of becoming a fully fledged infantryman at the age of 19.

'We were saying last summer how we had seen such a big change in him. I think it made him a man really,' said Mr Shaw.

The excitement of his training ended with the call for his first Afghanistan tour in 2010, where he would spend the defining months of his life.

'It was tough,' said his father. 'It was the first time he had been on active duty and it was worrying for all of us. He had never been away for so long.'

Mr Shaw's second tour of duty began in October 2012, and his family said he relished the extra responsibility his veteran status afforded him.

'All the younger ones were excited about getting into the action, but he was able to calm them down and tell them what it was really like,' said Mrs Shaw.

Despite their suffering, Mr and Mrs Shaw believe their son gave his life to a cause worth fighting for

The news that Mr Shaw had been wounded came on Monday, January 14.

'I was at work, and a man from the MoD came round and told my daughter Sarah he was in theatre in Camp Bastion. It's one of the best hospitals in the world so we were quite hopeful.'

Mr and Mrs Shaw were driven to Birmingham by the MoD, but say they had no idea what to expect when they arrived.

His younger sister Sarah Shaw, 25, said: 'It didn't even for a second cross my mind that he would die.

'We were more worried about what to say to him when we saw him, rather than fearing the worst.'

Her father added: 'We didn't know how bad it was until we got there. We were quite hopeful right up until we were told the prognosis, which wasn't good.

'I did will him to wake up a few times. He just looked like he was asleep,' added Sarah.

'We stroked his hair and squeezed his hand, hoping he would squeeze back. He just had a bandage on his neck, it's hard to look at somebody like that and think "there's no hope". That was the hardest thing.'

Despite their suffering, Mr and Mrs Shaw believe their son gave his life to a cause worth fighting for.

'Just because they're not doing good right on our doorstep, doesn't mean they're not doing good at all.

'A lot of people say it isn't worth it but the things the army are doing in Afghanistan are fantastic,' said Mr Shaw.

'When I think of what he did over there, and the people he helped after he died, I feel so proud.'
