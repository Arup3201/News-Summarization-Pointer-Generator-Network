A Confederate heritage group planning to install a large rebel battle flag near one of Virginia's busiest highways has been accused of racism.

Virginia Flaggers has leased private land alongside the Interstate 95 in Chesterfield County near Richmond from which to fly the flag on a 50-foot flagpole on September 28.

While the group says the flag is not racist and will honor 
Confederate soldiers, critics say it is an inherent symbol of slavery and segregation.

Controversial: Virginia Flaggers, a group promoting the public display of the battle flag, has leased private land along Interstate 95 in Virginia with plans to raise the flag on September 28

Flaggers spokeswoman Susan Hathaway said the flag 'will serve to welcome visitors and commuters to Richmond, and remind them of our honorable Confederate history and heritage', according to Mother Jones. 

Member Grayson Jennings told wtvr.com the group has raised more than the $3000 target for security fencing, lighting and a camera.

However he refused to disclose the exact location of the property, fearing vandalism from the plan's vocal opponents.

More than 3,000 people have signed a petition to stop the flag flying, according to wtvr.com. 

Taking a stand: The Virginia Flaggers say they have leased private land near the Interstate 95, just south of Richmond, in which to install the Confederate flag

Local politicians and the National 
Association for the Advancement of Colored People are protesting the 
plan to place the flag near Richmond, a former capitol of the 
Confederate States of America, according to The Wall Street Journal.

'I honor my ancestors but I'm not going 
to do that by flying a Confederate flag 150 years later,' Jon 
Baliles, a Richmond city councilor, said.

'I would like people going up and down 
[Interstate] 95 to know Richmond is a lot different than it used to be.'

L.J.
 McCoy Jr., president of the Chesterfield County branch of the NAACP, 
said erecting the flag would incite violence.

'If you want to honor 
your heritage and your ancestors, you need to do it in a more 
conservative way,' he said.

McCoy is among a number of opponents who say they are considering erecting a billboard near the flag with 
an alternative viewpoint.

Fundraising: Virginia Flaggers member Grayson Jennings said the group has raised enough money for security fencing, lighting and a camera

More than 150 years after the Civil War began, the flag remains divisive.

Confederate forces, fighting in part to preserve the institution of slavery, carried the banner into battle.

During the Civil Rights Movement in the 1950s and 1960s, many supporters of segregation, including the Ku Klux Klan, flew the flag to represent their cause.

Many groups now consider the flag a symbol of racial intolerance.

However its checkered history hasn't stopped Confederate advocates from placing similar flags in places including the Interstate 75 in Tampa, Florida, and around South 
Georgia.

'We're not offending anybody,' Flaggers member Barry Isenhour said.

'My hope is people start revering people's rights to honor their ancestors.'

wtvr.com reports work on the installation has not commenced.
