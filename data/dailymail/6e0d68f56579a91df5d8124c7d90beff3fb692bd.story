Sherri and Jenny are out. Rosie and Whoopi are in. But who's going to fill the remaining three hot seats when The View returns to the air this fall?

MailOnline has compiled a list of ABC's top contenders to replace the exiting Sherri Shepherd and Jenny McCarthy on the show that Barbara Walters built - and left 'kicking and screaming,' according to a network source.

In a desperate search to fill at least two of the three vacancies in time for the show's return in September - right now ABC is only planning to fill two spots - the network has been holding casting meetings with talent, even conducting one pivotal meeting on the July 4th holiday.

No love lost: Controversial talk show host Rosie O'Donnell is calling the shots on The View now, and veteran newscaster and the show's founder Barbara Walters left 'kicking and screaming,' says a network insider

A source close to the network has revealed to MailOnline the five  top contenders to join Rosie O'Donnell, 52,  and Whoopi Goldberg, 58,  when the chat show returns in September. The finalists include a Republican presidential candidate's daughter, a local New York anchor, the wife of a Republican Congressman,  a CNN legal analyst and a pregnant, previously ousted former moderator on The View.

Despite reports that Barbara Walters is 
helping to determine the new co-hosts, a source reveals that Walters has
 no involvement in the show any more. Although the TV legend is still credited as an executive 
producer, it’s in name only, claims the source.

Additionally, Walters herself has been 
taking meetings with various news organizations in New York looking for a new gig. At 84-years-old, she's been telling anyone who will listen that 
she was 'not ready to retire.'

According to Walters' rep, 'She is under contract with ABC News and is not looking or meeting with other news outlets.

'Additionally, Ms. Walters remains creator and Executive Producer of The View.

But insiders says outspoken Rosie holds the power now.

Rosie, who joined the show in 2006 only to leave the following year after a famously heated on-air exchange with conservative Elizabeth Hasselbeck over the Bush administration's stance on the Iraq war, among other controversies.

Now Rosie will help choose her new conservative counterpart as well as a more liberal voice on the panel.

The top contenders are:

The youth vote: At 28, she's the youngest of the candidates and she's had gigs at both ABC News and GMA

Abby, 28, is a 
conservative anchor on MSNBC's The Cycle who has guest-hosted on The 
View several times in recent months. The daughter of former Utah 
Governor and 2012 Republican presidential candidate Jon Huntsman, she's 
in the running because she could reach a younger demographic for the 
show. Despite being a Republican, she appeared in a 2013 campaign in 
support of gay marriage.

Abby was criticized by the Los Angeles Times this past March when she tried to discuss Social Security on 'The Cycle'. Her discussion 'bristled with rank misconceptions and bogus statistics,' it said. Less kind critics called her an 'airhead' and a Bush boot licker.

But maybe she can warm up viewers by talking about her love of chocolate, golden retrievers, music and running. Abby was the first one of six siblings to marry outside of the Mormon Church when she married her college sweetheart, Jeffrey Bruce Livington, in an Episcopal ceremony.

Safe BET: Jacque was the lead news anchor of BET Nightly News for four years and has been a guest co-host on The View

An anchor on New 
York's local NBC affiliate show New York Live and on-air contributor to 
the nationally syndicated Tom Joyner Morning Show, Reid, 29, starred on VH1's Let's Talk 
About Pep. She almost landed the co-host job at The View in 2007, but
 was ultimately beat out by Sherri Shepherd.

With more than fifteen years of media experience, Reid decided in early 2014 to launch her own website,SingleAndLivingFab.com, about her views on being single and loving it as well as interracial dating as a southern gal from Atlanta, GA. Just go for it, she advises, celebrate life and live your best single life wherever you are. 'I love all people, but I especially love black people'. If a fabulous man doesn't come along, plan something fabulous for your own life, she advises. She does love to show deep cleavage and bare shoulders on TV, and wears short skirts and high heels.

Get real: Mom of six Rachel first claim to fame was as a castmate on The Real World: San Francisco

The third 
time could be the charm for Duffy, a conservative Latina who has been up
 for the gig at The View twice before. Despite losing out to both Lisa
 Ling and Elizabeth Hasselbeck, the 42-year-old mother of six - pregnant with her seventh - has come 
back to co-host multiple times this spring. She's married to Republican 
Congressman Sean Duffy.

She wrote a book in 2009 entitled, Stay Home, Stay Happy: 10 Secrets to Loving At-home Motherhood, but the intoxication of motherhood must have worn off for the parenting expert who's aiming to live in New York if she gets on The View and feels the urgency to enter the 'lion's den' in the era of Kim Kardashian to challenge political opponents on their liberal policies.

But Duffy's claim to fame has more to do with her 'real' life before family. As a housemate on The Real Life: San Francisco in 1994 she caused a stir when she had initial concerns about a housemate who was HIV-positive and had a tumultuous fling with David 'Puck' Rainey.

Laying down the law: She's a former US Attorney and has appeared on Fox News as well as CNN

CNN's resident legal eagle just finished a one week guest-hosting stint
 where she was quick to remind viewers that she's a Latina. Hostin, 45, 
would be the first attorney to join the show since Star Jones was fired 
in 2006. But The View is seriously interested in appealing to the 
Latin market and feel she's a good fit. She joined CNN from the Fox News Channel, where she appeared regularly on The O'Reilly Factor's Is It Legal segment.

The outspoken New York native of Puerto Rican and African-American decent has jumped on headline grabbing trials and legal issues in her on-air jobs. She has been married to Dr. Emmanuel Hostin, an Orthopedic Surgeon since 1998 and has two young children but two nannies and a housekeeper to help out at home as well as her mother who lives in the Hostins' carriage house. It was her mother, an indomitable Latin matriarch, who convinced her not to go into TV news but to go to law school which would be far more lucrative and match her drive and ambition.

Fired: The mom-to-be was one of the original five on the show until she was let go by Walters. Rosie likes her

One of the 
original five co-hosts, Matenopoulos was fired in 1999 after the first season 
because Barbara Walters said she didn't have the TV experience they 
thought she did. She was ruthlessly parodied on Saturday 
Night Live an an uninformed ditz.

Her first marriage to Jay Faires, an 
LA music executive ended in divorce in 2008 when he charged they 
continuously lived beyond their means. He took her to court to pay the 
bills.

Matenpoulos didn't find love again until 2012 when she met 
photographer Jon Falcon, and she announced this spring that they secretly eloped last summer and have a baby due in the fall. An on air birth? That's good for ratings!

Men need not apply for one of the open seats. In spite of reports that Bill Rancic, Ross Matthews and Jesse Palmer are in the running, the network insider says that's not so.  Both Rosie and Whoopi only want women on the permanent panel.

Sources close to 'The View' reveal that O'Donnell is upset about not being able to work alongside Shepherd. It was O'Donnell who really championed for Shepherd to join the show back during the 2006/2007 season and she always appreciated how Shepherd was able to tell a joke during O'Donnell's infamous altercation with Elizabeth Hasselbeck to diffuse the situation.

Shepherd announced she was leaving the show several weeks ago after failing to come to terms with ABC. The source tells MailOnline that Shepherd only wanted to return to the show for a year and wanted to receive a substantial raise, as she's been carrying the show for a year and a half.

ABC wanted to lock the comedienne into a four-year contract and wouldn't budge. She decided not to stay.

No boys allowed: Rumors that guys like former Bachelor Jesse Palmer or reality star Bill Rancic are being considered are just that, says the network source. Neither Rosie nor Whoopi want men on the show

Rear view: Show execs wanted Sherri to stay - for four years. She wanted one year. And after moving to New York from Chicago with her son, Jenny was given the heave-ho

Her colleague McCarthy on the other hand was misled by the network. Having been told that ABC intended to renew her deal, McCarthy moved her special needs son Evan to New York from Chicago.  Three weeks later, ABC changed its mind and decided to let her go.

She was so furious she vowed never to return to the show initially, but Goldberg convinced her to work through the rest of the summer.

Also departing the scene are two producers and a director who were not particularly in Rosie's favor. Executive Producer Bill Geddie will produce the show until the end of the summer. Another senior producer was terminated and made to leave the building that day.

When The View returns in September, the show will have moved from its current studio of 17 years and will broadcast from a smaller studio that recently housed The Katie Couric Show.
