A 21-year-old unemployed man has become an internet sensation after he recorded an All About That Bass spoof in his little sister's bedroom, singing about his love for cakes.

Tyler Moffat decided to produce the video All About the Cakes, singing about his love for the sweet treats and chicken thighs, as he dances in front of the camera.

The video has become an internet hit after it was watched more than a million times on Facebook and 20,000 times on YouTube.

Mr Moffat, who did not expect the three minute video to become so popular, includes comic lines such as: 'Every part of me is jelly from the bottom to the top.'

Tyler Moffat recorded the spoof video 'for a laugh' and never expected it to become such a hit on the internet

Mr Moffat, 21, dances throughout his three minute spoof of All About That Bass posted on Youtube

He also says: 'Yeah, its pretty clear I eat a cake or two but if I’m really hungry it could be 22.'  

'It's absolutely nuts how much attention it has got,' Mr Moffat told MailOnline. 

'I never ever expected it to be like that.'  

He dances throughout the video, with a lipstick kiss mark on his neck, and looks to his friend laughing. 

He added: 'I just made the video for a laugh because I was bored. I put it on Facebook and it got a million views, and I thought, are you kidding me? It feels like a lifetime achievement.' 

Some of the lyrics see Mr Moffat dissolve in laughter, particularly as he sings the chorus 'Mama told me not to worry about my thighs. 

The 21 year old Scot said he was surprised when lines that he sang during the video rhymed 

Mr Moffat would like to be a comedian and said one of his greatest ambitions was to appear on Big Brother

'She said if you are still hungry go down and make yourself some chicken fries.' 

It also has a typically comic end as the music apparently stops, leaving Mr Moffat to explain what would have been his finale to the camera, before he eats a cake. 

Mr Moffat, who has been making comic videos since he was 16, has been caring for his mother, who has rheumatoid arthritis and sciatica for the last couple of years. 

'I'm all about the cakes, about the cakes, the cakes, no trifle, I'm all about the cakes

Yeah, it's very clear I can eat a cake or two but if I'm really hungry I might eat 22. 

I got the boom boom and all the shots, all the right s*** in all the right places. 

I see that Burger King working up all those shops. I know that food they make, try and make it stop. 

You got booty booty, just make it stop. 

Every burger that you give me, I will try and stuff them up. 

Mama told me don't worry about my thighs. She said if you are still hungry go downstairs and make yourself some fries. 

No, I won't be no stick figure, won't eat no salad bowls. 

So if that's what you are offering then I will get you f****** told.

Because you know it's about my thighs, about my thighs (repeats)

I'm bringing brownies back, go ahead and tell those skinny b****** that. 

So you think you're fat?

Every part of me is jelly from the bottom to the top 

Mama she told me don't worry about your size. She said go down the shop and buy yourself some chicken thighs. 

No, I won't be no stick figure, or silicone barbie doll.

So if that's what you want, go ahead, move.  

Because you know it's all about the cakes, about the cakes, no trifle (repeat)

[music stops]

The finale was going to be a nice sweet cake for myself. 

F*** it. Eat cakes you all.'  

He added: 'She doesn't want to have home help and is more comfortable if I'm here with her. So I'm often here, there and everywhere on the way back and forth to hospital appointments.'  

The video is a spoof of Meghan Trainor's video All About That Bass, which includes the line 'Mama told me not to worry about my size.'  

It has been liked thousands of times since Mr Moffat uploaded it on YouTube on September 24.

He said he would like to become a professional comedian but was unsure how to achieve it.

He said he has also been the victim of internet trolls which used to affect him, but following the success of the video he feels he can stand up to them. 

He added: 'I've had trolls on Facebook for years. I've had to learn to ignore it. If they are talking about me at least they are leaving someone else alone. 

'I would love to do something to do with comedy in the future and I would love to go on Big Brother. My whole family love it. But I can't because I'm here for my mum.'
