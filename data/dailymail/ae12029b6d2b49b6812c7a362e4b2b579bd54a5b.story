Novelist Hilary Mantel has warned the BBC not to turn a televised version of her books into ‘nonsense’.

Booker Prize-winning novels Wolf Hall and Bring Up The Bodies will be merged to create a six-part series starring Damian Lewis which will air next year.

Mrs Mantel was involved in the script stage of the production but will not have any further say in the televised version of her books.

The outspoken 62-year-old author, who was made a Dame in June, said she hoped producers would not add inaccuracies to her masterpieces.

Speaking at the Cheltenham Literature Festival, she said: ‘As soon as you decide this is too complicated for the viewer, or history is an inconvenient shape and can’t we just tidy it up a bit, then you fall into a cascade of errors which ends in nonsense.’

Yesterday, referring to TV series The Tudors – which was broadcast on the BBC in 2007 – she accused its creators of dumbing-down, saying: ‘At some point, someone had decided that it was too complex for Henry VIII to have two sisters, so they rolled them into one.

‘Then they had to find a fictitious king for her to marry, so I think they invented a king from Portugal unknown to history. It’s so shaming, and it stems from not trusting the intelligence of the viewer.

‘I think the problem was that there would be too many Marys in the story. But what do I do? Every second man in Henry VIII’s England is called Thomas.’

She added: ‘At any one time, there are five Thomases on the page, all shouting at each other. The only thing to do is let the reader in on it. Admit the difficulty. No one ever pretended historical fiction was easy and we should share that difficulty with our reader.’

Wolf Hall and Bring Up The Bodies are both set in the 16th century and depict the rise to power of Thomas Cromwell in the court of Henry VIII. The books have already been adapted for a stage version, which will be transferred to Broadway from March 2015.

Mrs Mantel sparked controversy in February last year when she described the Duchess of Cambridge as a ‘shop-window mannequin’ who was ‘machine-made’.

The author has since apologised for the comments made during a lecture organised by The London Review of Books.

Meanwhile, Game of Thrones star Charles Dance has launched a scathing attack on the state of British TV.

The 68-year-old actor told the Guardian: ‘We have to take risks in British television. It has to stop patronising people.

‘I think a lot of programme makers are underestimating the intelligence of the viewing public.’
