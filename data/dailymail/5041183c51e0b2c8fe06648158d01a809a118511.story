Dr Irfan Zafar says the 24-hour surgery is a 'better option' than running a blocked A&E

A hospital is set to open the first 24-hour GPs' surgery in Britain in a bid to ease its A&E crisis.

The pioneering service will mean that people who have come to A&E in desperation as they are unable to get an appointment with a GP will no longer clog up waiting times for emergency care.

It has been launched in an attempt to solve the major crisis in emergency care at Royal Blackburn Hospital which was so overwhelmed last month that 18 ambulances were seen queuing outside the A&E department.

It is thought the move could be copied by health trusts across the UK to help ease the worst winter A&E crisis on record.

Waiting times in A&E departments around the UK are at a record high - partly because so many patients are unable to get an appointment with their family doctor.

Doctors say the ‘groundbreaking’ plans in Blackburn will involve all 90 GPs from across the borough put on a rota to cover shifts at the 24-hour centre.

Nurses and support workers will also be seconded in to cater for minor injuries and ailments, such as an infected wound, sprains or minor burns.

Patients who turn up at A&E will be referred to doctors there on a walk-in basis where they will be given a time slot to avoid long waits.

Organisers say the appointments will be spread throughout the day to avoid the ‘surges’ that so often leave emergency staff struggling.

The surgery aims to transform the fortunes of the hospital’s emergency department, which has been struggling for several years with the sheer volume of patients turning up at the door.

Last month Dr Ian Stanley, the hospital’s medical director, said it was ‘unsustainable’ for NHS services in East Lancashire to remain as they are.

‘We need to redesign services to help people manage their long term conditions, rather than having them turn up at A&E,’ he added.

The plans have been unveiled by a newly-formed ‘federation’ of GPs, and proposes a new Acute Primary Care Centre to be built near the hospital helipad, close to the emergency department entrance.

Dr Irfan Zafar, senior federation member, said: ‘We have known for a long time that a lot of patients go to A&E when they don’t need to, and this is quite a unique idea to help solve that problem.

‘It’s impossible to get an appointment at many GP surgeries, and we believe that patients then turn up at hospital because of this.

‘But with this centre the triage nurse would be able to send patients with more minor problems over to us, which is a far better option than waiting hours and blocking up A&E.’

Dr Zafar said the planned centre could offer 35,000 extra appointments each year, or about 100 per day, and bring an end to the A&E crisis.

The emergency department at the Royal Blackburn is known to be the ‘busiest in the North West’ and has repeatedly failed to meet the headline four-hour the situation reached ‘crisis point’ over waiting target in recent years.

Eddie Reid, 70, who had to wait hours to be seen in the emergency department, said: ‘Anything they do has to be an improvement.

‘It has become diabolical and the number of people seeking treatment at the hospital because they can’t get an appointment has exploded.’

One paramedic said the first weekend of 2015 18 ambulance crews were forced to ‘queue’ for around two hours before handing patients over to staff.

He said: ‘This will be a massive help because we hope to reduce the number of A&E attendances by a big margin. It will also link in much better with GP surgeries, because we’ll have easy access to patient records.

‘There are huge delays in the system at the moment, when hospital doctors struggle to find out what medication patients are on, for example, and this puts patients at risk as well.

‘This centre will be much quicker, safer and efficient, as well as being much cheaper than seeing everyone in A&E. We think this is a groundbreaking and innovative bid and hopefully we’ll be successful. It’ll be a huge disappointment if it’s not.’

A formal bid has been submitted to the Prime Minister’s £100m Challenge Fund and has the backing of East Lancashire Hospitals NHS Trust, the council and patient groups.

Russ McLean, chairman of the Patients Voice Group for East Lancashire, said: ‘It is absolutely imperative that patients get help when they need it and for many patients, the default seems to be A&E.

‘I am convinced that patients will be seen in a more timely fashion and I am absolutely overjoyed that a not-for-profit organisation is involved in this process. I’m backing them all the way.’

Kevin McGee, chief executive at East Lancashire Hospitals NHS Trust, said there were also plans for on site services such as chemists and therapists to help meet patients’ needs.
