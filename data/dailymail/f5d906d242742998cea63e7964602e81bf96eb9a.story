A mother in China whose newborn baby was sold to human traffickers by a doctor has been reunited with her son.

Dong Wan, 31, wept as she held the boy at a hospital in Fuping, following the arrest of obstetrician Zhang Lin for allegedly trying to sell him to human traffickers.

The doctor apparently told Ms Dong, 31, that her son was born with severe health problems and would soon die.

Emotion: Dong Wan cries as she holds her newborn son after being reunited with him in hospital

Joy: Ms Dong, 31, is handed her baby after he was recovered from human traffickers

She is accused of persuading the 
mother to sign the baby over to the hospital before selling the boy to 
traffickers for £3,000 ($4,600).

Police in Shaanxi province say the doctor has now been arrested and fear the sale may be the tip of the iceberg.

Officers are investigating at least seven similar cases in the region.

The healthy baby boy was tracked down by investigators after Dong became suspicious.

Relief: The mother had been tricked by her obstetrician into handing over her son to him

Crime: Ms Dong spoke of her pain at being tricked by the doctor she had previously trusted

The
mother said: 'I was told the baby would not survive and the best thing 
for me would be to let the hospital take care of it so I did.'

After signing the documents at The 
Fuping County Maternal and Child Health Care Hospital <s Dong changed
her mind and begged her husband, Lai Guofeng, to call the police.

The
baby was tracked down hundreds of miles away in neighbouring Henan 
province where the original traffickers had sold him on for a profit.

Police investigators say Zhang and two suspected accomplices are under arrest.

deputy director Chen Jainfeng said: 'The suspects told us where the 
baby was and with the help of local police we found the child.

'The baby is undergoing medical tests and is on his way home.'
