Prince Edward and Sophie, Countess of Wessex, found themselves in a winter wonderland during their five-day visit to the snowy capital of Finland, Helsinki, today.

But forget husky rides and snowball fights - the royal couple were visiting the Jaeger Brigade, a unit of the Finnish Army, in Sodankylä, Finland.

The programme for the couple, who were wrapped up warm to protect themselves from the elements, included  ski towing and Arctic survival skills.

Sophie, Countess of Wessex, got stuck into her visit to the Jaeger Brigade in Sodankyla, Finland, where she and her husband learned all about the unit's survival skills

The royals were familiarising themselves with how the unit, which is located some 130km north of the Arctic Circle, functions.

The brigade, which trains 1,600 conscripts every year, are responsible for developing Arctic warfare tactics and working with equipment alongside the Swedish and Norwegian Arctic forces. 

Prince Edward, wearing a rather stylish hat, and the Countess were clearly getting into the spirit of things, despite the sub-zero temperatures.

Sophie, 50, burrowed her way through a snow tunnel with enthusiasm, while 50-year-old Prince Edward avidly listened to the tales of the unit.

The hardy pair enjoyed a bite to eat outside under a wooden shelter.

Food was arrayed on wooden tables and they sat on benches covered in animal skins while a logs burned merrily in a brazier - all while snow continued to fall. 

Fortunately they were wrapped up in fatigues with warm boots and furry hats.

The duo are on a five-day visit and were welcomed by British Ambassador to Finland, Sarah Price, President Sauli Niinistö and first lady Jenni Haukio on Monday.

Sophie of Wessex, who has become something of a rival to the Duchess of Cambridge in the style stakes, looked on-trend in a fitted black Tom Ford dress and leopard print scarf.

During their time in the snowy republic, the couple will meet athletes taking part in the international multi-sports event, The Island Games in Jersey later this year.

On their final day, the Queen's son will visit the Finnish Sauna Society, as well as the company behind the hugely popular Angry Birds franchise.
