Josephine Browne, 50, walked free from court today after she was cleared of spanking her colleague on the backside 'six times' at a London 

A police community support officer has walked free from court after she was cleared of repeatedly spanking a male colleague on the bottom and spying on him getting changed.

Josephine Browne, 50, was accused of sexual assault and common assault after allegedly slapping her co-worker on the backside six times leaving marks at a London police station.

Browne was said to have developed an ‘unhealthy’ interest with the young officer and was purportedly exposed her bra to him, offered to massage him and behaved provocatively towards him in a lift.

She denied the allegations throughout the three-day trial at Southwark Crown Court and yesterday a jury took less than an hour to clear her of the sexual assault charge – and today she was cleared of the remaining charge.

Judge Deborah Taylor discharging her criticised the way the incident had been investigated by police.

She said: ‘As far as the prosecution of this matter is concerned may I just say that the initial investigation by the officer who gave evidence in this court was particularly unsatisfactory and that should be passed back to those concerned.

‘The fact that he invited the complainant to seek support from other officers rather than take responsibility gives great cause for concern from someone of his experience.’

Peter Ryan, a retired police sergeant and Browne’s former boss, confessed he had asked the ‘tearful’ complainant to seek support from other officers on the team after he was informed of the allegations.

Giving evidence Browne, of Regents Park, London, had denied spanking her colleague and said: ‘That is not something I would do to somebody in or out of duty.’

She said there was ‘banter’ with her colleagues but strenuously denied touching the complainant or trying to seduce him.

Her accuser compared the alleged peeping tom incident as ‘like something out of Alfred Hitchcock’s Psycho movie’ and said he felt more comfortable dealing with criminals.

He said the spanking incident, alleged to have occurred whilst he carried a filing cabinet through the building with a colleague, was ‘the final straw.’

But Browne remained adamant and said: ‘At no point have I sexually assaulted him or any member of that group,’ she said.

‘The only thing I have done is put my hands on someone’s shoulders but not in a sexual way.

Pictured outside Southwark Crown Court yesterday, Browne was said to have developed an ‘unhealthy’ interest with the young officer and accused of exposeing her bra to him, offering a massage and behaving provocatively

‘I would say something like “Oh, hello boys” in a jokey way because we had a bit of banter.

‘Maybe it is not wise exactly but no-one has ever come to me and said “please don’t do that”.’

Defence counsel Tessa Shroff asked jurors to consider if they believed the former gardener could be a ‘sex offender’.

Ms Shroff also highlighted inconsistencies in the evidence of a fellow PCSO and the alleged victim.

In one instance they both blamed Browne for an incident in February when she had not started with the team until April.

‘The sad fact is that people do make false allegations,’ said Ms Shroff.

She denied the allegations throughout  three-day trial at Southwark Crown Court and yesterday a jury took less than an hour to clear her of the sexual assault charge – and today she was cleared of the remaining charge

Browne had confessed that she did not get on with the other PCSO although she thought she had a good relationship with the complainant.

‘She appeared to me to me to be an unhappy person. She didn’t like me, I’m not saying it is the only reason but I think she was a lady with issues,’ she said.

The other PCSO claimed she heard the ‘spanking’ and that Browne’s face had turned red with the exertion.

She said Browne had ‘underlying issues that need addressing’ but denied wanting to oust Browne from the team.
