A first time father has gone on a diet of only his wife's breast milk.

The man, identified only as Curtis, doesn't plan to eat any food and wants to see how long he can survive on the milk and what effects it has being on a liquid diet.

Details of the 'breast diet' were revealed by Curtis on a blog page.

He said his wife Katie, who has two other children, has dozens of bottles of frozen breast milk in their freezer and does not want to see it go to waste.

Writing on donthaveacowcurtis.blogspot.com, Curtis said he prefers the taste of breast milk to that produce by cows.

 'Fresh breast milk is sweeter and a bit 
more watery than cow milk.'

'I am a first time father of a 9 month old baby girl. Naturally I was curious what breast milk tastes like, as I am sure most people are.

'Fresh breast milk is sweeter and a bit more watery than cow milk. The breast milk also helped settle my stomach after having some digestive problems. I prefer the taste of breast milk over cow milk.

'My wife has hundreds of bottles of frozen breast milk in the freezer that our baby will never have a chance to drink before they get too old. Since breast milk is healthy and we have plenty of it, why not just drink it all myself?

'In fact, why not drink only breast milk and see how long I can happily make it with no other food?

'And yes, I know how weird this may sound, it is kind of weird to me as well but why not? I mean cow milk was made for baby cows, why not drink human breast milk that was made for baby humans?'

Curtis, an American, said he is 6ft 4in tall and weighs 185lbs.

He said he needs about 2,000 calories a day which equals to about 66 ounces of breast milk a day.

'Preparation is a snap, pour and drink, as long as I remember to take what I need from the freezer the night before.'

The blog features photographs of a fridge stacked with bottles of breast milk.

Curtis writes: 'The first day started at noon and I only drank 44 ounces, just over half of the 66 I need to drink to reach the target 2000 calories. 

'I didn't feel hungry or overly full, just satisfied, and the next morning I didn't have the "give me food!" feeling I usually get in the morning. Preparation is a snap, pour and drink, as long as I remember to take what I need from the freezer the night before.'

The blog was started by Curtis's wife Katie who said she stored up dozens of bottles of breast milk after the birth of her first two children who were premature.

Katie, who works as a childbirth coach, said she had looked into donating the breast milk, but they were unable to give it away.

She said: 'My husband offered to just drink only the milk in an effort to finish it up before we have to move. I liked the idea because then the milk wouldn't go to waste.

'We had no intentions of doing it for attention. A co-worker told us to blog about it and we thought it might be fun to share what my husband is doing.'
