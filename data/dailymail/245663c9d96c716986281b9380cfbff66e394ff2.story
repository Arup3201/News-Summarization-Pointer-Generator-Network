Brittany Macintyre, 20, was arrested for allegedly offering sex for a fee at the Tewksbury Public Library

It’s usually books or entertainment materials you check out from the local library so locals were surprised when police arrested a woman soliciting sex at the Tewksbury Public Library in Massachusetts.

On Tuesday the police were called and told that a woman was offering sex among the hardbacks.

They dispatched a plainclothes detective and he claimed that Brittany Macintyre of Nashua, New Hampshire, approached him almost immediately, giving him a pen and a piece of paper.

They communicated via notes until she allegedly asked him for $60 and offered to perform a sex act on him.

‘She handed him a pen and a piece of paper, and they conversed back and forth,’ saidTewksbury Deputy Chief of Police John Voto. ‘Ultimately she requested $60 for a sexual act.’

Macintyre, 20, was arrested and charged with prostitution. She was also wanted on a charge of possession of drugs.

‘I didn’t think Tewksbury was that big on prostitution,’ one local woman told a local TV station. ‘I’m quite shocked because a lot of kids come here and I’m a teacher, so it’s pretty scary.’

‘That’s something that you don’t normally see every single day, especially around here in Tewksbury,’ said a man.

She is due back in court on July 30.

This is the second time within the last year that someone has been arrested for soliciting sex at the Tewksbury Public Library.
