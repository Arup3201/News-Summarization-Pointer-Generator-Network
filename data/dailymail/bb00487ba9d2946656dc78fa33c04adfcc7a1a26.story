A pensioner who was found dead at a care home had injuries consistent with choking, police revealed today.

Police sealed off a number of rooms at Heathcote care home in Norwich after the woman in her 80s was found dead at 10pm on Wednesday evening.

A woman in her 50s from Hethersett near Norwich was arrested following the discovery - but has since been released on bail.

A woman found dead at Heathcote Care Home in Norwich on Wednesday had injuries 'consistent with choking'

A Home Office post mortem carried out today revealed the woman’s fatal injuries were 'consistent with choking.'

But a police spokesman said further tests will be conducted before a formal cause of death can be confirmed.

He added: 'It is anticipated that these results will not be received for several weeks.'

Detective Chief Inspector Paul Durham, of Norfolk Police, said: 'Investigations continue into the circumstances surrounding her death and are focusing on the standard of care received by the deceased immediately prior to her death.'

Heathcote caters for up to 29 residents over the age of 65 and offers short term and long term stays.

It is one of several homes which is privately owned and operated by Black Swan International Limited.

The manager of the home Becky Wyer was promoted last year from deputy manager.

An inspection by the Care Quality Commission in February last year found 'inconsistent support for staff to carry out their roles effectively' and said some workers were not regularly supervised.

But when inspectors returned in October they found standards had improved and the home was given a clean bill of health.

A spokesman for Black Swan International Limited said: 'We are unable to make a statement at this time because there is an ongoing police investigation into an incident and one of our homes.

'We can confirm that we are fully supporting the relevant authorities in their investigation.'
