An 81-year-old Chelsea pensioner has proved she is still young at heart after leaping out of a plane at 13,000 feet.

Charmaine Coleman, who lives at the Royal Hospital Chelsea, completed the skydive in a bid to raise money for the Army Benevolent Fund (ABF).

Donning a scarlet coat and large goggles, she hurtled towards the ground at 120mph while strapped to an instructor's front.

Adrenaline junkie: Charmaine Coleman, 81, proves that she is still young at heart by skydiving at 13,000 feet

Just one minute later, the pair touched down at Netheravon Airfield in Salisbury, Wiltshire.

Today, adrenaline junkie Ms Coleman described her death-defying feat on June 20 as 'exciting'.

'I wasn't nervous, just really excited - I couldn't wait to get up there,' said the pensioner, who was supported by The Tigers, the Army's freefall display team from the Princess of Wales Regiment.

'I've always been a bit adventurous, but it's a wonderful thing to do and I'd recommend it to anyone.'

Ms Coleman, who previously served in the Royal Military Police, is one of seven women living at the Royal Hospital Chelsea as a Chelsea pensioner.

The iconic building, founded by King Charles II and designed by Sir Christopher Wren, is also a place of refuge for former British soldiers 'broken by age or war'. 

To qualify for a place as a Chelsea pensioner, you have to prove a 
certain amount of service in the Army, and that you are ‘unencumbered by
 spouse’.

During her time in the Army, Ms Coleman was posted to Northern Ireland and Cyprus, before travelling to Germany to undertake a freefall course.

'When
 I was in the Army, I did a three week freefall course in Germany in 1970
 - I loved it immensely,' said the pensioner.

'I haven't done any parachute jumps since, and 
that was in 1970.'

Later this year, Ms Coleman plans to travel on the Trans-Siberian Railway with a friend.
