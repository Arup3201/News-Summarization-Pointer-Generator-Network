Mick Jagger and Jerry Hall's daughter Georgia has cancelled her scheduled appearance at Melbourne Fashion Week following the death of L'Wren Scott.

The model was set to appear on the runway for local fashion designer Camilla Franks this week.

The 22-year-old was informed of the tragic news when she landed in Sydney on Tuesday to connect to a Melbourne flight.

The grief-stricken star has since jetted out of Australia to head to New York to be with her family.

The UK Vogue February cover girl was the star of Camilla's spring 2013 show Pachamama last year.

Camilla's spokesman said in a statement: 'In light of the recent sad news, Georgia May Jagger will not be participating in Virgin Australia Melbourne Fashion Festival for the Camilla Grand Showcase. We ask that you respect Ms Jagger and her family’s privacy at this very difficult time,'

'On behalf of the Festival and the Camilla team we offer our sincere condolences to Ms Jagger and her family.'

L'Wren was found in her 
New York apartment on Monday having apparently taking her own life, 
leaving her friends, family and partner Mick devastated.

Georgia
 was regularly spotted out and about with her father's girlfriend and 
clearly had a close relationship with the fashion designer.

In
 September she sat front row with her famous dad at L'Wren's Spring 
Summer 2014 show at London Fashion Week and happily joined the pair at 
the Serpentine’s Summer Party earlier in the summer, which was also 
attended by her sister Jade.

In
 July the close knit family headed out to celebrate Mick’s 70th birthday
 at exclusive Mayfair club Lou Lou’s, after his anniversary tour gig at 
London’s Hyde Park. (In total, Mick has seven children with four 
different women, including Jade Jagger from his first marriage. He also 
has four grandchildren.

According to accounts for L'Wren's business, LS Fashion LTD, which were filed in the UK in October 2013, the company was in trouble, with a deficit of £3,546,000 and the designer owing creditors £4,593,000.

Friends have said the former model - known for her headstrong ways - had always refused financial help from her multi-millionaire partner of 13 years.

Speaking about L'Wren's fashion label, which she started in 2006, a source told MailOnline: 'L'Wren was in a lot of financial trouble. She was unable to pay her staff and her suppliers and it had been going on for a very long period of time.

'She wanted so badly for things to be a success. Whereas she got her outfits on a number of high profile people, the clothes were not a commercial hit and didn't fly off the shelves. It was a huge burden on her and she didn't want to fail.

'Everyone was very much left wondering why she didn't ask Mick for help. But she didn't. Things were left a long time and she spent the past few months struggling to pay the vast amount of her outgoings. It was a tragic situation and she kept it from everyone.

'Her staff expected the company to go under and her fabric suppliers and tailors were close to ending their working relationship. The bills just weren't getting paid.'

A spokesperson for Mick said he is 'completely shocked and devastated' by his partner's death.

Mick was in Perth ahead of his band's Australia tour. The band have since cancelled Wednesday's concert in the city and are expected to scrap the rest of the dates.

L'Wren, who is a former model and stylist, had cancelled a show at London Fashion Week in January, saying at the time fabrics arrived too late for samples to be sewn for the event. It is now thought the real reason was her financial difficulties.
