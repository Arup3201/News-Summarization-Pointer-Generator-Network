A mother whose nine-year-old daughter was kidnapped, raped and slashed to death in South Dakota 22 years ago has raised enough money to attend the convicted killer's execution.

Tina Curl, 50, appealed for help last month after she was unable to afford the 1,400-mile road trip from her home in Lake Luzerne, New York to South Dakota for Donald Moeller's execution.

After news coverage of her predicament, donations flooded in from as far away as Chicago and Alaska, and she has now raised the $4,000 she needed to drive and stay in Sioux Falls.

Looking for closure: Tina Curl, pictured with her husband Dave, has raised $4,000 to travel from New York to South Dakota to watch the execution of the man who killed her nine-year-old daughter

But as well as generous donations from strangers, Curl also received an onslaught of negative comments telling her to move on and seek help.

'Everybody wants to put me down because I want to be there to see the execution,' Curl said. 'Unless you've walked in my shoes, don't judge me. Don't tell me what you would do if it happened to you. You don't know until it happens to you.'

Moeller, who murdered Curl's daughter Becky O'Connell in 1990, will be executed with lethal injection between October 28 and November 3.

But with the exact date of the death unknown - the warden will give 48 hours notice - Curl and her husband also needed money to cover motel costs for the week.

Murderer: Donald Moeller, left, kidnapped Becky O'Connell, right, as she was on her way to a convenience store in 1990. He raped and repeatedly stabbed her, and she died from a sliced throat

Missed: Curl, pictured with Becky, will start the 1,400 mile journey to the prison at the end of October

They also needed help with gas money as Curl needs to travel by car as she suffered a heart attack and quadruple bypass in May 2003, is registered disabled and cannot fly.

Her husband Dave, who was not Becky's father, has been out of work for a year.

A neighbour helped Curl set up an online PayPal account and open a fund at a local credit union. Any money she does not spend on the trip will cover unpaid bills from O'Connell's funeral, she said.

'I have waited 22 long years for this,' Curl told ABC News. 'He watched her die and I am going to watch him die.'

'The sooner they get him strapped 
down, the better I’ll feel,' she added to the Argus Leader last month. 
'I’ve been preparing for the day for 20 years. I’d been thinking he’d 
die from health problems.'

Death sentence: Moeller will be put to death between October 28 and November 3 in Sioux Falls

Guilty: Moeller, now 60, repeatedly tried to overturn the conviction but now his lawyer said the killer accepts the execution as the consequences of his actions

Her daughter, Becky O'Connell, vanished on May 8, 1990 when she went to a
convenience store a block from her home in Sioux Falls. Moeller grabbed
her as she walked along the busy intersection.

The youngster's naked body was found 
in a ditch in Lincoln County, South Dakota the next morning; she had 
been raped and stabbed and died after her throat was slit, according to
court documents.

Moeller, now 60, was found guilty in 1992 and 
sentenced to 25 years in prison for the rape charge and death by lethal 
injection for the horrifying murder.

Donald Moeller has repeatedly tried 
to overturn his death penalty after it was set in 1992. In 1996, the 
South Dakota State Supreme Court agreed he did not get a fair trial.

Loved: Tina said the death would not bring her closure for her daughter's death but would help her heal

But when he was retried a year later, the verdict remained the same - death.

Moeller said through his attorney that he accepts the execution as the consequences of his actions.

Before the murder, he had a criminal 
history including sex abuse and the use of a knife against women and a 
13-year-old boy. On the day he killed Becky, he had a meeting with his 
parole officer.

The Curls plan to leave New York by car on October 25.
