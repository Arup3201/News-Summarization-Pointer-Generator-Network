This is the moment a 65-year-old grandfather is pounced on by police, bent over double and his arms twisted behind his back at a peaceful demonstration by the elderly and disabled.

Tony Nuttall’s arrest at a protest against travel pass cuts was described as disgusting by campaigners last night as police chiefs revealed they were investigating the incident.

The former Health Service manager was among dozens of campaigners – some in wheelchairs or using walking sticks – who had gathered at Sheffield railway station to demand the return of free travel on public transport, which was axed in March.

Surrounded: An elderly man was arrested by five police officers at Sheffield railway station yesterday

As police moved in, a man collapsed 
with breathing problems and a blind woman was ‘pushed over a 
wheelchair’.

Both were taken to hospital. Two people using sticks were 
reportedly knocked over and a man was ‘almost knocked out of his 
wheelchair.'

A journalist 
from the local paper was allegedly threatened with arrest under the 
Terrorism Act and made to delete footage because he did not have 
permission to film at the station. 

British Transport Police were videoed as they ‘jumped’ Mr Nuttall. One woman, shocked by their heavy-handedness, shouted: ‘What are you doing? He’s an old man, leave him alone.’

Fellow protester George Arthur, 64, a grandfather and former primary teacher, was also arrested.

Mr Arthur, who allegedly travelled on a train without buying a ticket as part of the protest, was charged with fare evasion and both men were charged with obstructing a police officer.

Members of Sheffield Disabled People Against The Cuts and Barnsley Retirees Action Group were demonstrating after South Yorkshire Passenger Transport Executive axed free rail travel for elderly and disabled passengers in the region and restricted free bus and tram passes to save more than £600,000 a year.

Scuffle: Protesters had earlier arrived in Sheffield by train from a nearby station to demonstrate against service cuts

In a partial U-turn, free travel for the disabled was restored last month and pensioners were given half-price rail fares at certain times. But the campaign has continued with ‘freedom rides’ in which protesters travel without paying their fare.

Accompanied by police, up to 60 travelled from Barnsley station to Sheffield on Monday, with some refusing to buy a ticket.

Arrested: Tony Nuttall, 65, today said his back and arms were hurt during the arrest

When they got off the train police formed a cordon blocking their exit from the platform.

Mr Arthur said: ‘We had a rally on the platform, sang and chanted.’ He said officers took action as he addressed the group using a megaphone. ‘Two officers grabbed me and said I was arrested,’ he added. ‘I was dragged down the platform with other protesters trying to get me free.’

Commenting on the police, he said: ‘There is widespread disgust at their behaviour.’ Mr Nuttall said he was ‘jumped from behind’ by police when he ‘tried to link arms’ with Mr Arthur as he was being arrested.

He added: ‘It was extremely uncomfortable and absolutely not necessary. I was not hitting out or anything, there was no need for that action.

‘This all happened very close to the edge of the platform. It was all very dangerous.’

The police said: ‘A number of incidents have been brought to our attention. We are in the process of fully investigating these.’

Mr Arthur and Mr Nuttall, both of Barnsley, will appear before Sheffield magistrates on July 7.
