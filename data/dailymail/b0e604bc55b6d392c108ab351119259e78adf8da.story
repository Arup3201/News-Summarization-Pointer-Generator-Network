Emaciated and barely able to walk, this is appalling condition a helpless dog was found in after he escaped from the home of his feckless master.

Crumb, the frail bull terrier, weighed only two stone and was suffering from an eye infection when he was rescued by a passerby as he scavenged for scraps near a burger van.

The muscles in the 11-year-old's back legs were so wasted by neglect they couldn’t even support him properly and he was taken to a Destitute Animal Shelter in Bolton, Greater Manchester.

Appalling condition: The muscles in Crumbs back legs were so wasted they couldn't even support him properly

But after being fed properly for the first time in four months, Crumb put on almost a stone. However, vets could not save his sight and were forced to remove his infected left eye.

Despite their care, Crumb died after succumbing to old age.

Crumb's cruel master jobless Joseph Moran, 37, of Bolton, was traced after he turned up at the animal shelter to 'reclaim his pet.'

At Bolton magistrates court he pleaded guilty to causing unnecessary suffering to an animal and failing to ensure its welfare.

He was disqualified from keeping animals 
for three years, ordered to pay £200 costs from his benefits payments 
and ordered to carry out 150 hours of unpaid work.

Drastic measures: Vets could not save his sight and were forced to remove his infected left eye. Later he would die of old age

An RSPCA inspector who helped Crumb said it was one of the worst cases of animal neglect he had ever seen

The court heard Moran had been looking after the dog for around six months when a passerby found Crumb found wandering the streets near the burger van in Little Lever on May 2.

The pet weighed just 13.8kg - just over two stone - when he should have been 20kg.

After examination from a vet, it was confirmed Crumb’s eye had been untreated for around six months, and he hadn’t been fed properly for three to four months.

The long-standing eye infection was so severe that the eye had to be removed.

Had Crumb been presented for veterinary treatment earlier it could easily have been treated, the RSPCA said.

An RSPCA inspector said it was one of the worst cases of animal neglect he had ever seen.

Prosecutor Tony Walsh told the hearing: 'Moran said he noticed the eye was bad and took the dog to the vets.

'He claimed the vet said putting hot water on the eye should be fine, so he began doing that and tried to treat the dog himself.

'He hasn’t offered an explanation as to the malnutrition of the dog. As soon as the dog was fed properly it began to gain weight.'

Defending Moran, Mohammed Patel said his client believed Crumb had swallowed a ball and that was causing him to lose weight.

He said Moran had taken the animal to see a vet but could not afford the fees and ‘thought the dog would just get better’.

He added: 'He wasn’t aware as to how much it had deteriorated over time. He does feel for Crumb and has co-operated fully with the RSPCA.'

Moran was planning to borrow money to have him treated when he went missing.

Since the RSPCA took up the case against Moran, the charity is estimated to have spent £3,300 in vets fees, legal fees and kennels.

Sentencing Moran District Judge Jonathan Feinstein told Moran: 'It’s quite apparent this dog was seriously neglected by you.

'Those people who have possession of dogs must understand it comes with a serious responsibility.

Ordering him to complete community work the judge added: 'During that time you will do something good for society rather than what you have done in the past with this animal.

'There are no excuses for the way you looked after this dog and you should be ashamed of yourself. If this happens again you will go to prison.'

After the case RSPCA Inspector Ben Strangwood said: 'Crumb was in one of the poorest states of malnourishment I have ever seen.

'He had a lovely personality and it was so sad when he eventually died - but he was also an old dog.

'We’ll take it as a positive outcome that Moran can’t keep animals for three years.'
