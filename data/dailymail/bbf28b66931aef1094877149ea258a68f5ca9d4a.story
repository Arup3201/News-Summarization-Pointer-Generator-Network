A Mississippi pastor is protesting the possibility of legal marriage equality in his state by dressing his horse in a wedding dress outside a federal courthouse. 

Reverend Edward James of Bertha Chapel Missionary Baptist Church dressed his horse in the dress to protest same-sex marriage.

'The horse is to show the ridiculous idea of two men getting married,' Rev. Edward James said about his one-man demonstration to WJTV.

Making his point: Reverend Edward James of Bertha Chapel Missionary Baptist Church in South Carolina protested marriage equality by dressing a horse in a wedding dress

The Rev. Edward James stood alongside the horse around noon Friday outside the Federal Courthouse in Jackson. He held up a sign that said, 'Marriage is one man and one woman. Anything else is a perversion.'

James held one sign stating in part, 'Do you take this horse to be your unnatural wedded spouse to have and to hold?'

Another sign read, 'Marriage is one man and one woman… anything else is a perversion.'

'I'm a Mississippian and I'm praying and hoping that we will remain a state that only recognizes marriage between a man and a woman,' says James. 

The pastor stood outside for more than two hours as people honked their horns or stopped to take pictures. 

As Charlotte grazed on an area of grass passersby stopped in the middle of the road to grasp what exactly was happening.

One passing driver yelled, 'Your horse is pretty!'

Why the long face? Conservatives often criticize legalizing same-sex marriages by comparing it to bestiality

U.S. District Judge Carlton Reeves struck down the state ban on marriage equality last month, but stayed his ruling to allow state officials time to bring an appeal.

James acknowledged the 'ridiculous' nature of his display in an interview with the Jackson Clarion Ledger.

'I'm hoping that Judge Reeves will reconsider his ruling and that Mississippi will stay a state that will only recognize marriage between a man and a woman,' James said. 

'The argument is not about sin or religious belief or what the church says about marriage equality,' local LGBT activist Eddie Outlaw told WJTV. 

'It is strictly about benefits, rights, protection extended by government not by the church.'

'I thought it was laughable and I believe he was going for a ridiculous protest and he certainly got one''

Growing population: Mississippi is home to an estimated 3,484 same-sex couples, according to the most recent decennial census. About one quarter of the couples are raising children

'I think the good reverend should probably focus on what he can do to minister to the needs of the LGBT community and not get involved with hot button interests like marriage equality right now,' said Mr Outlaw.

Gay couples cannot yet marry in Mississippi. The federal court of appeals will hear arguments about the ban on same sex-marriage on January 9th in New Orleans. 

The appeal will be heard along with gay marriage cases from Texas and Louisiana. A panel of judges will decide if same-sex marriage will be legal in all three states. 

Gay marriage is legal in 35 U.S. states, a trend that has accelerated since the Supreme Court ruled in June 2013 that legally married same-sex couples nationwide are eligible for federal benefits, striking down a key part of the 1996 federal Defense of Marriage Act.

While gay marriage advocates have enjoyed the upper hand in the courts since then, the Cincinnati-based 6th Circuit U.S. Court of Appeals in November became the first to rule the other way in upholding state bans on same-sex marriage.

That decision was seen as setting the stage for the Supreme Court to finally rule on the merits of gay marriage nationwide.

Mississippi is home to an estimated 3,484 same-sex couples, according to the most recent decennial census. About one quarter of the couples are raising children. 

Food for thought: The federal court of appeals will hear arguments about Mississippi's ban on same sex-marriage January 9th in New Orleans
